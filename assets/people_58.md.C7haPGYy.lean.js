A variant of Canadian French known as New England French is still spoken in parts of New England. History Some early emigrants relocated to the United States because they had chosen to side with the Americans during the American Revolution. Parish archives of Old St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia record trips made by Jesuit Father Ferdinand Steinmeyer (Father Farmer) to the Revolutionary War depot near Fishkill, New York, where he baptized over a dozen children of French-Canadian and Acadian parents. Most of the men were members of the 1st Canadian Regiment of the Continental Army, recruited in 1775 by James Livingston in anticipation of an invasion of Quebec. As the expedition failed, they, their families, and the American militias were driven out of Canada. Approximately 900,000 French-Canadians emigrated to the United States in the period of 1840-1930 during the first wave of the Quebec diaspora.B√©langer, Damien-Claude. \\"French Canadian Emigration to the United States 1840-1930\\", Marianopolis College The vast majority of these francophones settled in the six New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, as well as northern New York State. Distribution of French Americans according to the 2000 census Emigrants moved to states close to Quebec, particularly those bordering the province, because of their generally impoverished condition and lack of jobs as a result of a poor economy over-reliant on agriculture. In the 19th century, the United States was one of the most industrialised and prosperous nations on earth. The emigrants left behind a traditional rural society to enter an industrial world. Centers of the New England textile and other manufacturing industries such as Lowell, Massachusetts; Holyoke, Massachusetts;http://www.terrastories.com/holyoke/french-canadians.html Manchester, New Hampshire; Lewiston, Maine; and Woonsocket, Rhode Island were major destinations for Quebec labor. French Canadians from other provinces often moved elsewhere: those from Ontario typically emigrated to Illinois and Michigan, while those from Manitoba and other Western provinces usually emigrated to Minnesota and Wisconsin. Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota boasted a large French Canadian community in 1900. One of the more famous \\"Little Canadas\\" was the West Side of Manchester, New Hampshire, a city with a large French-speaking population due to the recruitment of labor in Quebec to work in the textile mills in the 19th and 20th centuries. \\"La Caisse Populaire Ste. Marie,\\" or \\"St. Mary's Bank,\\" located in Manchester's Little Canada, was the first credit union chartered in the United States, specifically founded to serve the French Canadian population. The credit union, or \\"people's bank\\" (\\"la caisse populaire\\") was a financial institution pioneered in Quebec, by Quebecers who had difficulty obtaining credit from banks controlled by anglophone Canadians. The most noted resident of Manchester's \\"petit Canada\\" was Grace Metalious, author of the best-selling novel Peyton Place. Metalious denied her French Canadian heritage and mostly lived in non-French Canadian neighborhoods in Manchester, due to her mother's desire to avoid prejudice. During World War II, Metalious eventually had to live in Little Canada after her husband went off to war due to a housing shortage. In contrast, novelist Robert Cormier of Leominster, Massachusetts highlighted the culture of fictitious but representative Little Canadas in New England in many of his works, notably \\"Frenchtown Summer.\\" Revlon founder Charles Revson, of Russian- Jewish extraction, grew up in a cold-water tenement in Manchester's Little Canada. Other prominent Little Canadas were found in Lowell, Massachusetts, the home of novelist Jack Kerouac, and Lewiston, Maine. Another notable Franco-American community sprung up in southeastern Massachusetts, namely in Fall River. As a result, a number of cultural and charitable organizations, such as the Franco-American Civic League, the Club Richelieu, La F√©d√©ration Catholique Franco-Am√©ricaine de Fall River, and L'Association Culturelle Fran√ßaise de Fall River, were founded to foster French language and culture within the Franco-American community.Many of the organizational records are housed in the Archives and Special Collections at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

Through activism and art, BAM created new cultural institutions and conveyed a message of black pride. Famously referred to by Larry Neal as the ‚Äúaesthetic and spiritual sister of Black Power,\\" BAM applied these same political ideas to art and literature. The movement resisted traditional Western influences and found new ways to present the black experience. The poet and playwright Amiri Baraka is widely recognized as the founder of BAM. In 1965, he established the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School (BART/S) in Harlem. Baraka's example inspired many others to create organizations across the United States. While these organizations were short- lived, their work has had a lasting influence.  Background  Novelist James Baldwin on the Albert Memorial, Kensington Gardens, London African Americans had always made valuable artistic contributions to American culture. However, due to brutalities of slavery and the systemic racism of Jim Crow, these contributions often went unrecognised. Despite continued oppression, African American artists continued to create literature and art that would reflect their experiences. A high-point for these artists was the Harlem Renaissance‚Äîa literary era which spotlighted black people. = Harlem Renaissance = There are many parallels that can be made between the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement. The link is so strong, in fact, that some scholars refer to the Black Arts Movement era as the Second Renaissance. One sees this connection clearly when reading Langston Hughes's The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain (1926). Hughes's seminal essay advocates that black writers resist external attempts to control their art, arguing instead that the ‚Äútruly great‚Äù black artist will be the one who can fully embrace and freely express his blackness. Yet, the Harlem Renaissance lacked many of the radical political stances that defined BAM. Inevitably, the Renaissance, and many of its ideas, failed to survive the Great Depression. = Civil Rights Movement = During the Civil Rights era, activists paid more and more attention to the political uses of art. The contemporary work of those like James Baldwin and Chester Himes would show the possibility of creating a new 'black aesthetic'. A number of art groups were established during this period, such as the Umbra Poets and the Spiral Arts Alliance, which can be seen as precursors to BAM. Civil Rights activists were also interested in creating black-owned media outlets, establishing journals (such as Freedomways, Black Dialogue, The Liberator, Negro Digest, The Black Scholar and Soul Book) and publishing houses (such as Dudley Randall's Broadside Press and Third World Press.) It was through these channels that BAM would eventually spread its art, literature, and political messages. Developments The beginnings of the Black Arts Movement may be traced to 1965, when Amiri Baraka, at that time still known as Leroi Jones, moved uptown to establish the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) following the assassination of Malcolm X. Rooted in the Nation of Islam, the Black Power movement and the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement grew out of a changing political and cultural climate in which Black artists attempted to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience. Black artists and intellectuals such as Baraka made it their project to reject older political, cultural, and artistic traditions.Smethurst, James E. The Black Arts Movement: Nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s (The John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture), NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 2005. Although the success of sit-ins and public demonstrations of the Black student movement in the 1960s may have \\"inspired black intellectuals, artists, and political activists to form politicized cultural groups,\\" many Black Arts activists rejected the non-militant integrational ideologies of the Civil Rights Movement and instead favored those of the Black Liberation Struggle, which emphasized \\"self-determination through self-reliance and Black control of significant businesses, organization, agencies, and institutions.\\"Douglas, Robert L. Resistance, Insurgence, and Identity: The Art of Mari Evans, Nelson Stevens, and the Black Arts Movement. NJ: Africa World Press, 2008. According to the Academy of American Poets, \\"African American artists within the movement sought to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience.\\" The importance that the movement placed on Black autonomy is apparent through the creation of institutions such as the Black Arts Repertoire Theatre School (BARTS), created in the spring of 1964 by Baraka and other Black artists. The opening of BARTS in New York City often overshadow the growth of other radical Black Arts groups and institutions all over the United States. In fact, transgressional and international networks, those of various Left and nationalist (and Left nationalist) groups and their supports, existed far before the movement gained popularity. Although the creation of BARTS did indeed catalyze the spread of other Black Arts institutions and the Black Arts movement across the nation, it was not solely responsible for the growth of the movement. Although the Black Arts Movement was a time filled with black success and artistic progress, the movement also faced social and racial ridicule. The leaders and artists involved called for Black Art to define itself and speak for itself from the security of its own institutions. For many of the contemporaries the idea that somehow black people could express themselves through institutions of their own creation and with ideas whose validity was confirmed by their own interests and measures was absurd. While it is easy to assume that the movement began solely in the Northeast, it actually started out as \\"separate and distinct local initiatives across a wide geographic area,\\" eventually coming together to form the broader national movement. New York City is often referred to as the \\"birthplace\\" of the Black Arts Movement, because it was home to many revolutionary Black artists and activists. However, the geographical diversity of the movement opposes the misconception that New York (and Harlem, especially) was the primary site of the movement. In its beginning states, the movement came together largely through printed media. Journals such as Liberator, The Crusader, and Freedomways created \\"a national community in which ideology and aesthetics were debated and a wide range of approaches to African-American artistic style and subject displayed.\\" These publications tied communities outside of large Black Arts centers to the movement and gave the general black public access to these sometimes exclusive circles. As a literary movement, Black Arts had its roots in groups such as the Umbra Workshop. Umbra (1962) was a collective of young Black writers based in Manhattan's Lower East Side; major members were writers Steve Cannon,\\"A Gathering of the Tribes\\" (Place Matters, January 2012) includes biography of Steve Cannon. Tom Dent, Al Haynes, David Henderson, Calvin C. Hernton, Joe Johnson, Norman Pritchard, Lennox Raphael, Ishmael Reed, Lorenzo Thomas, James Thompson, Askia M. Tour√© (Roland Snellings; also a visual artist), Brenda Walcott, and musician-writer Archie Shepp. Tour√©, a major shaper of \\"cultural nationalism,\\" directly influenced Jones. Along with Umbra writer Charles Patterson and Charles's brother, William Patterson, Tour√© joined Jones, Steve Young, and others at BARTS. Umbra, which produced Umbra Magazine, was the first post-civil rights Black literary group to make an impact as radical in the sense of establishing their own voice distinct from, and sometimes at odds with, the prevailing white literary establishment. The attempt to merge a black-oriented activist thrust with a primarily artistic orientation produced a classic split in Umbra between those who wanted to be activists and those who thought of themselves as primarily writers, though to some extent all members shared both views. Black writers have always had to face the issue of whether their work was primarily political or aesthetic. Moreover, Umbra itself had evolved out of similar circumstances: in 1960 a Black nationalist literary organization, On Guard for Freedom, had been founded on the Lower East Side by Calvin Hicks. Its members included Nannie and Walter Bowe, Harold Cruse (who was then working on The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, 1967), Tom Dent, Rosa Guy, Joe Johnson, LeRoi Jones, and Sarah E. Wright, and others. On Guard was active in a famous protest at the United Nations of the American- sponsored Bay of Pigs Cuban invasion and was active in support of the Congolese liberation leader Patrice Lumumba. From On Guard, Dent, Johnson, and Walcott along with Hernton, Henderson, and Tour√© established Umbra. =Authors= Another formation of black writers at that time was the Harlem Writers Guild, led by John O. Killens, which included Maya Angelou, Jean Carey Bond, Rosa Guy, and Sarah Wright among others. But the Harlem Writers Guild focused on prose, primarily fiction, which did not have the mass appeal of poetry performed in the dynamic vernacular of the time. Poems could be built around anthems, chants, and political slogans, and thereby used in organizing work, which was not generally the case with novels and short stories. Moreover, the poets could and did publish themselves, whereas greater resources were needed to publish fiction. That Umbra was primarily poetry- and performance-oriented established a significant and classic characteristic of the movement's aesthetics. When Umbra split up, some members, led by Askia Tour√© and Al Haynes, moved to Harlem in late 1964 and formed the nationalist- oriented Uptown Writers Movement, which included poets Yusef Rahman, Keorapetse \\"Willie\\" Kgositsile from South Africa, and Larry Neal. Accompanied by young \\"New Music\\" musicians, they performed poetry all over Harlem. Members of this group joined LeRoi Jones in founding BARTS. Jones's move to Harlem was short-lived. In December 1965 he returned to his home, Newark (N.J.), and left BARTS in serious disarray. BARTS failed but the Black Arts center concept was irrepressible, mainly because the Black Arts movement was so closely aligned with the then-burgeoning Black Power movement. The mid-to-late 1960s was a period of intense revolutionary ferment. Beginning in 1964, rebellions in Harlem and Rochester, New York, initiated four years of long hot summers. Watts, Detroit, Newark, Cleveland, and many other cities went up in flames, culminating in nationwide explosions of resentment and anger following the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Nathan Hare, author of The Black Anglo-Saxons (1965), was the founder of 1960s Black Studies. Expelled from Howard University, Hare moved to San Francisco State University, where the battle to establish a Black Studies department was waged during a five- month strike during the 1968‚Äì69 school year. As with the establishment of Black Arts, which included a range of forces, there was broad activity in the Bay Area around Black Studies, including efforts led by poet and professor Sarah Webster Fabio at Merrit College. The initial thrust of Black Arts ideological development came from the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a national organization with a strong presence in New York City. Both Tour√© and Neal were members of RAM. After RAM, the major ideological force shaping the Black Arts movement was the US (as opposed to \\"them\\") organization led by Maulana Karenga. Also ideologically important was Elijah Muhammad's Chicago- based Nation of Islam. These three formations provided both style and conceptual direction for Black Arts artists, including those who were not members of these or any other political organization. Although the Black Arts Movement is often considered a New York-based movement, two of its three major forces were located outside New York City. =Locations= As the movement matured, the two major locations of Black Arts' ideological leadership, particularly for literary work, were California's Bay Area because of the Journal of Black Poetry and The Black Scholar, and the Chicago‚ÄìDetroit axis because of Negro Digest/Black World and Third World Press in Chicago, and Broadside Press and Naomi Long Madgett's Lotus Press in Detroit. The only major Black Arts literary publications to come out of New York were the short- lived (six issues between 1969 and 1972) Black Theatre magazine, published by the New Lafayette Theatre, and Black Dialogue, which had actually started in San Francisco (1964‚Äì68) and relocated to New York (1969‚Äì72). Although the journals and writing of the movement greatly characterized its success, the movement placed a great deal of importance on collective oral and performance art. Public collective performances drew a lot of attention to the movement, and it was often easier to get an immediate response from a collective poetry reading, short play, or street performance than it was from individual performances. The people involved in the Black Arts Movement used the arts as a way to liberate themselves. The movement served as a catalyst for many different ideas and cultures to come alive. This was a chance for African Americans to express themselves in a way that most would not have expected. In 1967 LeRoi Jones visited Karenga in Los Angeles and became an advocate of Karenga's philosophy of Kawaida. Kawaida, which produced the \\"Nguzo Saba\\" (seven principles), Kwanzaa, and an emphasis on African names, was a multifaceted, categorized activist philosophy. Jones also met Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver and worked with a number of the founding members of the Black Panthers. Additionally, Askia Tour√© was a visiting professor at San Francisco State and was to become a leading (and long-lasting) poet as well as, arguably, the most influential poet-professor in the Black Arts movement. Playwright Ed Bullins and poet Marvin X had established Black Arts West, and Dingane Joe Goncalves had founded the Journal of Black Poetry (1966). This grouping of Ed Bullins, Dingane Joe Goncalves, LeRoi Jones, Sonia Sanchez, Askia M. Tour√©, and Marvin X became a major nucleus of Black Arts leadership. As the movement grew, ideological conflicts arose and eventually became too great for the movement to continue to exist as a large, coherent collective. =The Black Aesthetic= Although The Black Aesthetic was first coined by Larry Neal in 1968, across all the discourse, The Black Aesthetic has no overall real definition agreed by all Black Aesthetic theorists. It is loosely defined, without any real consensus besides that the theorists of The Black Aesthetic agree that \\"art should be used to galvanize the black masses to revolt against their white capitalist oppressors\\".Pollard, Cherise A. ‚ÄúSexual Subversions, Political Inversions: Women πs Poetry and the Politics of the Black Arts Movement.‚Äù New Thoughts on the Black Arts Movement, edited by Lisa Gail Collins and Margo Natalie Crawford, Rutgers University Press, 2006, pp. 173‚Äì186. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj474.12. Pollard also argues in her critique of the Black Arts Movement that The Black Aesthetic \\"celebrated the African origins of the Black community, championed black urban culture, critiqued Western aesthetics, and encouraged the production and reception of black arts by black people\\". In The Black Arts Movement by Larry Neal, where the Black Arts Movement is discussed as ‚Äúaesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept,‚Äù The Black Aesthetic is described by Neal as being the merge of the ideologies of Black Power with the artistic values of African expression. Larry Neal attests: > \\"When we speak of a 'Black aesthetic' several things are meant. First, we > assume that there is already in existence the basis for such an aesthetic. > Essentially, it consists of an African-American cultural tradition. But this > aesthetic is finally, by implication, broader than that tradition. It > encompasses most of the usable elements of the Third World culture. The > motive behind the Black aesthetic is the destruction of the white thing, the > destruction of white ideas, and white ways of looking at the world.\\"Neal, > Larry. \\"The Black Arts Movement\\", Floyd W. Hayes III (ed.), A Turbulent > Voyage: Readings in African American Studies, San Diego, California: > Collegiate Press, 2000 (3rd edition), pp. 236‚Äì246. The Black Aesthetic also refers to ideologies and perspectives of art that center on Black culture and life. This Black Aesthetic encouraged the idea of Black separatism, and in trying to facilitate this, hoped to further strengthen black ideals, solidarity, and creativity.\\"Black Arts Movement\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article In The Black Aesthetic (1971), Addison Gayle argues that Black artists should work exclusively on uplifting their identity while refusing to appease white folks.Smalls, James. \\"Black aesthetic in America.\\" Grove Art Online. September 16, 2010. Oxford University Press,. Date of access 15 Oct. 2018, The Black Aesthetic work as a \\"corrective,\\" where black people are not supposed to desire the ‚Äúranks of Norman Mailer or a William Styron‚Äù. Black people are encouraged by Black artists that take their own Black identity, reshaping and redefining themselves for themselves by themselves via art as a medium. Hoyt Fuller defines The Black Aesthetic \\"in terms of the cultural experiences and tendencies expressed in artist‚Äô work\\" while another meaning of The Black Aesthetic comes from Ron Karenga, who argues for three main characteristics to The Black Aesthetic and Black art itself: functional, collective, and committing. Karenga says, \\"Black Art must expose the enemy, praise the people, and support the revolution\\". The notion \\"art for art‚Äôs sake\\" is killed in the process, binding the Black Aesthetic to the revolutionary struggle, a struggle that is the reasoning behind reclaiming Black art in order to return to African culture and tradition for Black people.KARENGA, RON (MAULANA). \\"Black Cultural Nationalism.\\" SOS -- Calling All Black People: A Black Arts Movement Reader, edited by John H. Bracey et al., University of Massachusetts Press, AMHERST; BOSTON, 2014, pp. 51‚Äì54. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vk2mr.10. Under Karenga‚Äôs definition of The Black Aesthetic, art that doesn‚Äôt fight for the Black Revolution isn‚Äôt considered as art at all, needed the vital context of social issues as well as an artistic value. Among these definitions, the central theme that is the underlying connection of the Black Arts, Black Aesthetic, and Black Power movements is then this: the idea of group identity, which is defined by Black artists of organizations as well as their objectives. The narrowed view of The Black Aesthetic, often described as Marxist by critics, brought upon conflicts of the Black Aesthetic and Black Arts Movement as a whole in areas that drove the focus of African culture; In The Black Arts Movement and Its Critics, David Lionel Smith argues in saying ‚ÄúThe Black Aesthetic,‚Äù one suggests a single principle, closed and prescriptive in which just really sustains the oppressiveness of defining race in one single identity. The search of finding the true ‚Äúblackness‚Äù of Black people through art by the term creates obstacles in achieving a refocus and return to African culture. Smith compares the statement ‚ÄúThe Black Aesthetic‚Äù to ‚ÄúBlack Aesthetics‚Äù, the latter leaving multiple, open, descriptive possibilities. The Black Aesthetic, particularly Karenga‚Äôs definition, has also received additional critiques; Ishmael Reed, author of Neo-HooDoo Manifesto, argues for artistic freedom, ultimately against Karenga‚Äôs idea of the Black Aesthetic, which Reed finds limiting and something he can‚Äôt ever sympathize to. The example Reed brings up is if a Black artist wants to paint black guerrillas, that is okay, but if the Black artist ‚Äúdoes so only deference to Ron Karenga, something‚Äôs wrong‚Äù. The focus of blackness in context of maleness was another critique raised with the Black Aesthetic. Pollard argues that the art made with the artistic and social values of the Black Aesthetic emphasizes on the male talent of blackness, and it‚Äôs uncertain whether the movement only includes women as an afterthought. As there begins a change in the Black population, Trey Ellis points out other flaws in his essay The New Black Aesthetic. Blackness in terms of cultural background can no longer be denied in order to appease or please white or black people. From mulattos to a \\"post-bourgeois movement driven by a second generation of middle class,\\" blackness isn‚Äôt a singular identity as the phrase \\"The Black Aesthetic\\" forces it to be but rather multifaceted and vast. = Major works =  Black Art  Amiri Baraka's poem \\"Black Art\\" serves as one of his more controversial, poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being \\"on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people.\\" Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry. Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. \\"Black Art\\" serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should \\"shoot‚Ä¶come at you, love what you are\\" and not succumb to mainstream desires. He ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents \\"live words‚Ä¶and live flesh and coursing blood.\\" Baraka's cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its \\"authentic, un-distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music.\\" Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka's cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 1950s, a period of rock and roll, in which \\"record labels actively sought to have white artists \\"cover\\" songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts\\" originally performed by African- American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American hip-hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's \\"Walk This Way\\" took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences. Hip-hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as \\"gangsta rap,\\" merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka's ideals presented in \\"Black Art,\\" focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.  The Revolutionary Theatre  \\"The Revolutionary Theatre\\" is a 1965 essay by Baraka that was an important contribution to the Black Arts Movement, discussing the need for change through literature and theater arts. He says: \\"We will scream and cry, murder, run through the streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved, moved to actual life understanding of what the world is, and what it ought to be.\\" Baraka wrote his poetry, drama, fiction and essays in a way that would shock and awaken audiences to the political concerns of black Americans, which says much about what he was doing with this essay. It also did not seem coincidental to him that Malcolm X and John F. Kennedy had been assassinated within a few years because Baraka believed that every voice of change in America had been murdered, which led to the writing that would come out of the Black Arts Movement. In his essay, Baraka says: \\"The Revolutionary Theatre is shaped by the world, and moves to reshape the world, using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world. We are history and desire, what we are, and what any experience can make us.\\" With his thought-provoking ideals and references to a euro-centric society, he imposes the notion that black Americans should stray from a white aesthetic in order to find a black identity. In his essay, he says: \\"The popular white man's theatre like the popular white man's novel shows tired white lives, and the problems of eating white sugar, or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing.\\" This, having much to do with a white aesthetic, further proves what was popular in society and even what society had as an example of what everyone should aspire to be, like the \\"bigcaboosed blondes\\" that went \\"onto huge stages in rhinestones\\". Furthermore, these blondes made believe they were \\"dancing and singing\\" which Baraka seems to be implying that white people dancing is not what dancing is supposed to be at all. These allusions bring forth the question of where black Americans fit in the public eye. Baraka says: \\"We are preaching virtue and feeling, and a natural sense of the self in the world. All men live in the world, and the world ought to be a place for them to live.\\" Baraka's essay challenges the idea that there is no space in politics or in society for black Americans to make a difference through different art forms that consist of, but are not limited to, poetry, song, dance, and art.  Effects on society  Ntozake Shange (1978), author of for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf. According to the Academy of American Poets, \\"many writers--Native Americans, Latinos/as, gays and lesbians, and younger generations of African Americans have acknowledged their debt to the Black Arts Movement.\\" The movement lasted for about a decade, through the mid-1960s and into the 1970s. This was a period of controversy and change in the world of literature. One major change came through in the portrayal of new ethnic voices in the United States. English-language literature, prior to the Black Arts Movement, was dominated by white authors. African Americans became a greater presence not only in the field of literature but in all areas of the arts. Theater groups, poetry performances, music and dance were central to the movement. Through different forms of media, African Americans were able to educate others about the expression of cultural differences and viewpoints. In particular, black poetry readings allowed African Americans to use vernacular dialogues. This was shown in the Harlem Writers Guild, which included black writers such as Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy. These performances were used to express political slogans and as a tool for organization. Theater performances also were used to convey community issues and organizations. The theaters, as well as cultural centers, were based throughout America and were used for community meetings, study groups and film screenings. Newspapers were a major tool in spreading the Black Arts Movement. In 1964, Black Dialogue was published, making it the first major Arts movement publication. The Black Arts Movement, although short, is essential to the history of the United States. It spurred political activism and use of speech throughout every African-American community. It allowed African Americans the chance to express their voices in the mass media as well as become involved in communities. It can be argued that \\"the Black Arts movement produced some of the most exciting poetry, drama, dance, music, visual art, and fiction of the post-World War II United States\\" and that many important \\"post-Black artists\\" such as Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and August Wilson were shaped by the movement. The Black Arts Movement also provided incentives for public funding of the arts and increased public support of various arts initiatives. =Legacy= The movement has been seen as one of the most important times in African- American literature. It inspired black people to establish their own publishing houses, magazines, journals and art institutions. It led to the creation of African-American Studies programs within universities. The movement was triggered by the assassination of Malcolm X. Among the well-known writers who were involved with the movement are Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, Maya Angelou, Hoyt W. Fuller, and Rosa Guy.Cheryl Higashida, Black Internationalist Feminism: Women Writers of the Black Left, 1945-1995, University of Illinois Press, 2011, pp. 52‚Äì53.Nelson, Emmanuel S., The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature: A ‚Äî C, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2005, p. 387. Although not strictly part of the Movement, other notable African-American writers such as novelists Toni Morrison and Ishmael Reed share some of its artistic and thematic concerns. Although Reed is neither a movement apologist nor advocate, he said: > I think what Black Arts did was inspire a whole lot of Black people to > write. Moreover, there would be no multiculturalism movement without Black > Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing as a > result of the example of the 1960s. Blacks gave the example that you don't > have to assimilate. You could do your own thing, get into your own > background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I > think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow > for that. BAM influenced the world of literature with the portrayal of different ethnic voices. Before the movement, the literary canon lacked diversity, and the ability to express ideas from the point of view of racial and ethnic minorities, which was not valued by the mainstream at the time. = Influence = Theatre groups, poetry performances, music and dance were centered on this movement, and therefore African Americans gained social and historical recognition in the area of literature and arts. Due to the agency and credibility given, African Americans were also able to educate others through different types of expressions and media outlets about cultural differences. The most common form of teaching was through poetry reading. African-American performances were used for their own political advertisement, organization, and community issues. The Black Arts Movement was spread by the use of newspaper advertisements.‚ÄúThe Black Arts Movement (1965-1975).‚Äù The Black Arts Movement (1965-1975)  The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed, www.blackpast.org/aah/black-arts-movement-1965-1975.

Jensen emigrated to Australia in 1909, becoming a British subject at Adelaide, South Australia, in 1914. A sailor and labourer before World War I, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in March 1915, serving with the 10th Battalion during the latter stages of the Gallipoli campaign. After the Australian force withdrew to Egypt, Jensen was transferred to the newly formed 50th Battalion, and sailed for France with the unit in June 1916. On the Western Front, he was wounded during the battalion's first serious action, the Battle of Mouquet Farm in August, and only returned to his unit in late January 1917. On 2 April, his battalion attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil, where his actions leading to the capture of over fifty German soldiers resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross. In June 1917, the 50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines; the following month, Jensen, now a corporal, was posted to a training unit in the United Kingdom. He returned to his battalion in October, and was promoted to temporary sergeant in November. In March 1918, the German Spring Offensive was launched, and Jensen fought with his battalion at Dernancourt and Villers-Bretonneux. Shortly after the fighting at Villers-Bretonneux, Jensen was on patrol when he received a severe head wound, and was evacuated to the United Kingdom, then repatriated to Australia, where he was discharged in Adelaide at the end of the war. He worked as a marine store dealer and married in 1921, but died the following year. Early life J√∏rgen Christian Jensen was born on 15 January 1891 in L√∏gst√∏r, Denmark, the son of J√∏rgen Christian Jensen and Christiane S√∏rensen, who was apparently also known as Jensen. S√∏rensen was a single mother who worked in agriculture. The younger Jensen's early life was difficult, but he was a good student, and entered the fishing industry. In 1908, aged 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom before emigrating to Australia. He sailed to Melbourne in March 1909, then moved to Morgan, South Australia, and later Port Pirie, working respectively as a sailor on river steamers on the Murray River, and as a labourer. He was naturalised as a British subject in Adelaide on 7 September 1914. World War I On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service in World War I; he was allotted to the 6th reinforcements to the 10th Battalion. His reinforcement draft embarked on HMAT Borda at Outer Harbor on 23 June, and joined the battalion at Gallipoli, Turkey, on 4 August. By the time Jensen arrived, nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. For the remainder of the Gallipoli campaign, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line defending the beachhead until withdrawn to Lemnos in November. Jensen remained with his unit throughout, except for a week in September‚ÄìOctober that he spent in hospital. The battalion embarked for Egypt in late November and spent the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the Suez Canal. While in Egypt, the battalion was split into two, one half forming the nucleus of the new 50th Battalion, which was part of the 13th Brigade, 4th Division. In April 1916, Jensen and several other 10th Battalion men were transferred to the 50th Battalion; later that month Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at tattoo. On 5 June the battalion embarked for France, arriving in Marseilles six days later. The unit then entrained for the Western Front, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June near Fleurbaix. The 50th Battalion saw its first serious action during the Battle of Mouquet Farm in mid-August 1916. During the battle, the 50th Battalion suffered 414 casualties, largely from the heavy German artillery bombardment. On 14 August, Jensen was hit in the left shoulder by a piece of shrapnel. He was evacuated to the UK and admitted to Graylingwell War Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex. While in the UK, he was charged with more disciplinary infractions in September, December and January, on one occasion being sentenced to 28 days field punishment for missing the troop train to return to France, and on another serving 12 days detention for being absent without leave. He did not rejoin his unit until 28 January 1917. The 50th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support and reserve positions, and underwent training in rear areas. The battalion was also involved in pursuing the Germans as they withdrew to the Hindenburg Line of fortifications. On 2 April, the 13th Brigade attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil. The attack consisted of the 51st Battalion attacking the village from the north, and the 50th Battalion from the south. During this assault, which was preceded by a weak artillery barrage, the 50th Battalion suffered extraordinary difficulties, and the centre company, to which Jensen belonged, was forced to detach a party of men equipped with a large number of hand grenades (then known as bombs) to deal with a strongly barricaded German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right. Jensen was a member of this party. His actions during the reduction of this post resulted in a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at that time. He was assisted in his actions by Private William Quinlan O'Connor and four others. The recommendation read: During the assault on Noreuil, Jensen also freed Australian prisoners, and assisted in the \\"mopping-up\\" of German resistance in the village itself when he captured a German officer or non-commissioned officer, who pointed out which building the fire was coming from. The 50th Battalion suffered 360 casualties, including 95 dead, and captured 70 Germans, nearly all of whom were taken by Jensen and his party. O'Connor was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in capturing the German post. On 4 April, Jensen was promoted to lance corporal. His award of the Victoria Cross appeared in The London Gazette on 8 June, by which time the 50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines, suffering 149 casualties. After being relieved, the battalion continued its rotation through front line, support and reserve positions. alt=a black and white photograph of a group of men in uniform on a ship In July 1917, Jensen was temporarily promoted to corporal and transferred to the 13th Training Battalion at Codford in the UK as an instructor. While there, he was entertained by Danish residents of Kingston upon Hull. After another disciplinary infringement, he returned to France, rejoining his battalion on 6 October. He was temporarily promoted to sergeant in early November, and the battalion spent the winter of 1917‚Äì18 rotating through the front line. In late March 1918, the battalion left its rest area and, along with many other Australian units, was quickly deployed to meet the German Spring Offensive south of the River Ancre. On 5 April, the battalion took up positions at Dernancourt and there contributed to the defeat of the \\"largest German attack mounted against Australian troops during the war\\" during the Second Battle of Dernancourt. The fighting at Dernancourt was followed by a move to the Villers-Bretonneux sector, where, on 25 April, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux that drove the Germans from that village, at a cost to the battalion of 254 casualties. On 5 May, Jensen was on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux when he was shot in the head. Severely wounded, he was admitted to hospital in France, and on 18 May was evacuated to the UK, where he was admitted to the Richmond Military Hospital in Surrey. Jensen reverted to the rank of corporal on being evacuated. Following two weeks' leave, he was repatriated to Australia, along with nine other Victoria Cross recipients, in August 1918 to take part in a recruiting campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He disembarked in Adelaide on 11 October, and was discharged from the AIF on 2 December. He was assessed to be partially disabled, and received a small pension. For his service during the war, as well as his Victoria Cross he was issued the 1914‚Äì15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. Post-war alt=a colour photograph of an engraved marble headstone After his discharge, Jensen worked for a short time as a barman in Truro, then as a marine store dealer in Adelaide. He married Katy Herman ( Arthur), a divorc√©e, at the Adelaide Registry Office on 13 July 1921. Their marriage was heavily affected by his wartime experiences. In April 1922, a photograph of Jensen and his horse-drawn cart, with \\"J. C. Jensen V.C.\\" painted on the side, was published on the front page of The Sunday Times newspaper in Sydney; the caption noted that he employed several men in his business. On 28 May, Jensen was admitted to the Adelaide Hospital, and died of congestion of the lungs three days later, aged 31. On 2 June, Jensen's casket was carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage to the West Terrace Cemetery, followed by hundreds of former members of the 50th Battalion, and he was buried with full military honours in the AIF section of the cemetery. It was reported as \\"one of the most impressive funerals which have passed through the gates of the West Terrace Cemetery\\", and \\"probably one of the largest military funerals ever held in Adelaide\\". The pastor at the service said that Jensen was, \\"modest always... ever ready to enlarge on the bravery of others, without touching on his own accomplishments\\". Jensen's medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was donated by a family member to the Australian War Memorial in 1987 at a ceremony attended by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour of the memorial. In 2006, a memorial to Jensen was unveiled in L√∏gst√∏r by the Australian ambassador to Denmark, and a book about him was published in Denmark in the same year. Each year, wreaths are placed at the memorial in memory of Jensen, and in 2014 a wreath was placed by the Australian ambassador, Damien Miller.

Biography Elizabeth Violet Maconchy was born in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, of Irish parents, and grew up in England and Ireland. Her family moved to Ireland in 1917, where they lived in Howth, on the east coast. The adolescent Maconchy began her musical studies in Dublin, studying piano with Edith Boxhill, and harmony and counterpoint with Dr John Larchet.For more information on this period, see Ailie Blunnie, 'Passion and Intellect in the Music of Elizabeth Maconchy DBE (1907‚Äì1994)', Unpublished Thesis, NUI Maynooth University, 2010 Those formative years in Ireland where important for Maconchy, who considered herself Irish.See Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 2. See also Anna Beer, \\"Maconchy\\", 'Sounds and Sweet Airs: The Forgotten Women of Classical Music' (2016), London: One World, 2017, p. 318 Throughout her career she was identified as an Irish composer, or as an English composer with 'Celtic' influences, by reviewers and commentators.See Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., pp. 286‚Äì330. In 1923, at the age of sixteen, she moved to London to enrol at the Royal College of Music. At the RCM Maconchy studied under Charles Wood and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Her contemporaries at the college included Grace Williams, Dorothy Gow, and Ina Boyle. Early compositions such as the violin sonata and Piano Concertino of 1927 already show the influence of European composers, especially Bartok.LeFanu, Nicola: Elizabeth Maconchy, Some Biographical and Musical Notes As a student, Maconchy was awarded the Blumenthal Scholarship in 1927, and the Octavia Scholarship of 1930, which allowed her to continue her studies in Prague. Her first public recognition came in 19 March 1930 with a performance of her Piano Concerto, conducted by her teacher there, Karel Jirak. This was followed on 30 August by a BBC Proms performance of her cantata The Land, conducted by Henry Wood,BBC Proms Archive which was inspired by the long poem of the same name by Vita Sackville-West. In response to the scarce opportunities for young avant garde composers and for female composers, a group women got together to organise regular concerts at the small Ballet Club theatre in Notting Hill, London, showcasing new work. It has been claimed that this venture \\"changed the face of music in London\\", and that it \\"prove[d] a lifeline for Elizabeth Maconchy through the 1930s\\".Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., pp. 299, 300. In 1930 Maconchy married William LeFanu, with whom she had two daughters: Elizabeth Anna LeFanu (born 1939) and Nicola LeFanu (born 1947). In 1932, Maconchy developed tuberculosis and she moved with her family from London to Kent. She returned to Ireland in 1939, living in Dublin for a brief period, during which she composed her Fifth String Quartet, which some critics consider her greatest achievement,See Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. 345. and gave birth to a daughter. Maconchy did much to improve the conditions of composers, being elected Chair of the Composers Guild of Great Britain in 1959, a position she held for a number of years. She was also President of the Society for the Promotion of New Music. Maconchy was a socialist, and her activism extended to supporting the Democratic/Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and other causes.See Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit. Maconchy's friends included the English composer Elisabeth Lutyens, Welsh composer Grace Williams, the Irish composer Ina Boyle, and the Czech music critic . Maconchy once declared that: \\"for me, the best music is an impassioned argument\\".Quoted in Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. 301. She died in Norwich, England. Compositions Maconchy is considered to be \\"one of the finest composers the British Isles have produced\\".Martin Anderson, in an article of 1991, quoted in Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 227. Her work has been compared to that of Bartok, who was an acknowledged influence, and also to Beethoven and Mozart, as well as (favourably) to contemporaries such as Britten.See Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. She produced over 200 works. According to Ailie Bloony, Maconchy was \\"a gestural composer, concerning herself with short musical fragments, as opposed to large-scale concepts or templates\\", at least in part because of her \\"ideology\\" as a composer, so that \\"she never planned anything out, musically speaking, in any great detail in advance of composition, [and by using shorter formats] she could afford to explore the possibilities implicit in the ideas themselves as they arose\\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 226. In terms of style, Maconchy had \\"a predilection for intervallic composition\\", and, \\"profoundly influenced by the resonances produced by certain intervals, [she] tended to build works around one or a small number of intervals, which varied according to the work in question\\". A favoured \\"harmonic device\\" was the \\"simultaneous use of major and minor sonorities\\", which \\"came to denote episodes of heightened emotion\\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 229. Blunnie is acknowledging here composer Grace Williams assessment of this device as a \\"fingerprint\\" of Maconchy. It has been argued that her work is often \\"driven by rhythm\\", which gives it its characteristic confluence of \\"energy, dynamism and imagination\\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 230. Maconchy's cycle of thirteen string quartets, composed between 1932 and 1983, is regarded as the peak of her musical achievements.Hugo Cole and Jennifer Doctor, \\"Maconchy, Dame Elizabeth\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). Historian of music Anna Beer has contended that \\"Maconchy loved the quartet form because it represented a debate, a dialectic between four balanced, individual, impassioned voices.\\"Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. 305. She also wrote for voice. Maconchy wrote three one-act operas, including the erotic comic opera 'The Sofa', based on an eighteenth century novel, and stylistically in \\"dialogue with Mozart\\",Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. 323. which shocked the audience for its explicitness when it premiered in 1959. In 1943 she responded to war with \\"The Voice of the City\\", for women's chorus. about the Battle of Stalingrad. In 1981 she set to music prose versions of some Petrarchan sonnets, by the Irish writer J.M.

The boots are typically made of twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on the inside, a tanned outer surface and a synthetic sole. The term \\"ugg boots\\" originated in Australia, initially for utilitarian footwear worn for warmth, and which were often worn by surfers during the 1960s. In the 1970s, the boots were introduced to the surf culture of the United Kingdom and the United States. Sheepskin boots became a fashion trend in the U.S. in the late 1990s and as a worldwide trend in the mid-2000s. In Australia, they are worn predominantly as slippers and often associated with \\"daggy\\" fashion sense and \\"bogan\\" culture. Prior legal disputes between some manufacturers of sheepskin boots arose as to distinguish whether \\"ugg\\" is a protected trademark, or a generic term and thus ineligible for trademark protection. There are more than 70 registered trademarks that include the term \\"ugg\\" in various logos and designs in Australia and New Zealand, as the term is considered a generic reference to a type of shoe.Trade Marks Hearings 16 January 2006. Decision of a delegate of the registrar of trade marks with reasons. Pg 10 Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG is a brand manufactured by the California-based Deckers Outdoor Corporation, with most of its manufacturing based in China and with registered trademarks in over 130 countries worldwide including the US, UK, Canada, all European Union members, and China. A noteworthy manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand is the Luda Productions of Australia, which has roughly 75% of the market share in Australia; EMU Australia Binder Corporation and Westhaven Industries. Deckers is the leading manufacturer of the footwear style outside Australia. By 2010, worldwide sales by Australian manufacturers combined equalled 5.9% of Deckers UGG boots sales, with UGG dominating the world market. History Cutting boot pieces from a sheepskin using a cutting press Stitching the innersole of an Australian ugg boot There are different claims to the origins of the ugg boot style. Artisanal sheepskin boots were known in rural Australia during the 1920s, and were reportedly worn by shearers as they found them resistant to wool yolk (Lanolin), which would rot their ordinary boots. However, the date of commercial manufacturing began remains unclear. The boots were reportedly being manufactured in 1933 by Blue Mountains Ugg Boots of New South Wales. Frank Mortel of Mortels Sheepskin Factory has stated that he began manufacturing the boots in the late 1950s. Surfer Shane Stedman of Australia has stated in interviews that he invented the ugg boot. Perth sheepskin boot manufacturers Bruce and Bronwyn McDougall of Uggs-N-Rugs have manufactured the boots since the late 1970s. The origin of the term \\"ugg\\" is also unclear. Stedman registered the trademark \\"UGH-BOOTS\\" in Australia in 1971, and in 1982 registered the \\"UGH\\" trademark. Frank Mortel claims that he named his company's sheepskin boots \\"ugg boots\\" in 1958 after his wife commented that the first pair he made were \\"ugly.\\" Some accounts have suggested that the term grew out of earlier variations, such as the \\"fug boots\\" worn by United Kingdom Royal Air Force pilots during World War I. The 1970s saw the emergence of advertising using the UGG and UGH terms both in trade names and as a generic term in Australia. The Macquarie Dictionary of the Australian language first included a definition for \\"ugg boot\\" as a generic term for sheepskin boots in its 1981 edition. (After Stedman complained to the editors of Macquarie, a trademark notation was added to subsequent editions indicating that \\"UGH\\" was a trade mark). In the 1970s, ugg boots became popular among competitive surfers. Sheepskin footwear accounts for around 10 percent of footwear production in Australia. =International sales= Surfing helped popularise the boots outside Australia and New Zealand. Advertisements for Australian sheepskin boots first appeared in Californian surf magazines in 1970.Conley, Lucas Behind the Brand: The Golden Fleece Wall Street Journal 9 September 2010. By the mid-1970s, several surf shops in Santa Cruz, California and the San Fernando Valley were selling a limited number of boots purchased by the shops' owners while visiting surfing events in Australia.Brian Smith Booty Call Los Angeles Magazine 1 October 2001 Pg 75 In 1978, a Western Australian manufacturer of sheepskin boots, Country Leather, advertised outside Australia for distributors to sell its sheepskin boots, which were made from sheepskin sourced from Jackson's Tannery in Geelong, Victoria. Seeing the popularity of the boots among American surfers, Australian surfer Brian Smith, then living in Santa Monica, California, and colleague Doug Jensen bought boots from Country Leather but were unhappy with the brand and decided to register UGG as their own trademark. Family friends invested $20,000 into the new venture and the group set up Ugg Imports. Due to other business commitments, in 1979 Jensen handed over his share of the company to Smith. In 1987 Smith registered Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1985 registered a U.S. trademark on a ram's head logo with the words \\"Original UGG Boot UGG Australia.\\" In 1995, Ugg Holdings purchased Stedman's various trademarks. As for the ugg name, Smith stated: \\"We always called them uggs, long before it was trademarked.\\"From Ugg to uglier The Telegraph 29 February 2004 Shoe manufacturer Hide & Feet in Newquay, Cornwall began manufacturing sheepskin boots in 1973, and in 1990 Nick Whitworth and his wife Kath bought the business and registered \\"UGG\\" as a trade mark in the UK. Due to increasing popularity and sales, in 1991 the company changed its name to \\"The Original Ugg Co.\\" In 1999, Whitworth sold the company name and the British UGG trade mark to Deckers Outdoor Corporation, renaming his company the Celtic Sheepskin Company. By 1994, UGG boots had grown in status among surfers in California with 80% of sales in southern Orange County where Ugg Holdings saw an increase in sales of 60 percent on the previous season. Smith's UGG boots gained international exposure when they were worn by the U.S. Olympic team in Lillehammer for the 1994 Winter Olympics.Foster, Caryl Ugg's going mainstream with slimmer boots Footwear News. Cond√© Nast Publications 14 February 1994. HighBeam Research accessed 7 September 2012 Australian manufacturers also saw an increase in exports of sheepskin boots to the United States, although Ugg Holdings retained an estimated 80% market share. By the end of the year, Country Leather had opened its own shop in Redondo Beach to promote an expansion of the brand from its established surf market into mainstream footwear sales and Ugg Holdings began sourcing UGG boots directly from Jackson's Tannery, which had changed its name to EMU Australia.Cronin, Emily The story of Ugg The Daily Telegraph 30 January 2011 In early 1995, Smith promoted the UGG AUSTRALIA brand on the Rush Limbaugh show, which spurred sales while the brand gained further exposure when the San Diego Chargers started wearing them.

Design Fashion ugg boots Traditional Australian ugg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside. Some ugg boots have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene- vinyl acetate (EVA). The stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot. The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives isothermal properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibres on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature and allowing the boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Produced by a number of manufacturers, they come in a variety of colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and fuchsia. They are available in both pull-on and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee. Some variations of ugg style boots have also been made from kangaroo fur and leather. There are also synthetic boots. Although derided as \\"fake\\" by some in the industry, their lower price made them appealing to large retail chains such as Myer. =Animal rights= Sheep-skin is a by-product of processing sheep for human consumption. That is, sheep are not specifically killed for their skins. Because it is a by-product, the supply of sheep-skin is limited by the number of sheep processed for the meat industry. The rise in the popularity of \\"UGG\\"-branded ugg boots has been the \\"driving force\\" in recent shortages, which have seen sheep-skin prices from 2010 to 2012 increase by up to 80%.Sheepskin and Shearling Frequently asked Questions Shepherd's Flock Being one of many clothing products made from animal skin, the production of sheepskin boots has been the subject of criticism by the animal rights movement with producers responding by improving animal welfare. Animal rights groups call for the boycott of sheepskin boots and their replacement with synthetic alternatives. In 2007, Pamela Anderson, realizing that the boots were made of skin, called for a boycott on her website. In February 2008, the Princeton Animal Welfare Society staged a campus protest against the fur industry, particularly attacking the sheepskin boot industry. Trademark disputes The trademarking of the UGG name has been the subject of dispute in several countries. Deckers Outdoor Corporation has won disputes in the United States, the Netherlands, and Turkey.Website of Walker Morris UK solicitors firm, Leeds. \\"Legal Briefing from the Trade Marks and Designs Group, 3 October 2011.\\" In Australia and New Zealand, ugg is a generic term. The trademark for \\"Ugh-Boots\\" has been removed from the trademark registry for non-use. Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG (written in capital letters) is a registered trademark of Deckers Outdoor Corporation. The first trademark application for UGG in the United States was filed by Brian Smith's company in 1984. In the 1990s, Smith and then Deckers secured additional registrations in the U.S. and other countries. In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out cease and desist letters to Australian manufacturers that were selling sheepskin boots outside of Australia via the internet. By the early 2000s, demand for UGG boots was soaring with Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers selling sheepskin boots over the Internet. There was confusion among consumers between generic ugg boots made in Australia and Deckers' UGG brand boots. Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt the Australian companies' sales by sending cease and desist letters to a number of Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers, preventing them from selling sheepskin boots using the UGG trademark on eBay or from using the word in their registered business names or domain names. Deckers initiated numerous domain name actions under the UDRP. In response to these actions by Deckers, some Australian manufacturers formed the Australian Sheepskin Association to fight the corporation's claim, arguing that \\"ugg\\" is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots. One of these manufacturers, Perth's Uggs-N-Rugs, who had been manufacturing ugg boots since 1978 and selling them online since 1996, appealed to Australian trademark regulators. The officer who heard the case stated that the \\"evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods.\\" In 2006 Uggs-N-Rugs won the right to use the term UGG BOOT/S and variations such as UGH BOOT/S within Australia. Deckers retained the trademark rights to their UGG logo in Australia as trademark protection only applies to the way the mark appears in its entirety and not the words it contains. IP Australia also ruled that the trademark \\"UGH-boots\\" (with hyphen) should be removed from the trademark register for non-use as Deckers had only been using the UGG logo, not the UGH marks. This 2006 ruling applies only in Australia and Deckers still owns the trademarks in other jurisdictions such as the US, China, Japan and the European Union.

Names Hermann's name is sometimes anglicized as Herman or latinized as Hermannus; it sometimes also appears in the older form Heriman. He is sometimes distinguished as Hermann of V√∂hringen (; ) from his birthplace. He is better known as Hermann of Reichenau (; ) from the location of his monastery on Reichenau Island () in Lake Constance. He was traditionally distinguished in Latin as ' (), which appears in English as \\"Hermann the Lame\\" () or \\"Hermann the Cripple\\" (). Life Hermann was a son of the Count of Altshausen.

As a result, he had great difficulty moving and could hardly speak. At seven, he was placed in a Benedictine monastery by his parents who could no longer look after him. He grew up in the Abbey of Reichenau, an island on Lake Constance in Germany. He learned from the monks and developing a keen interest in both theology and the world around him. At twenty, Hermann entered their order as a Benedictine monk,Bl. Herman the Cripple - Catholic Online becoming literate in several languages (including Arabic, Greek and Latin) and contributing to all four arts of the quadrivium. He wrote about history, mathematics, astronomy, and Christianity.Schlager, Patricius, \\"Hermann Contractus,\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton, 1910), retrieved May 13, 2014, from New Advent. He wrote a treatise on the science of music, several works on geometry and arithmetics, and astronomical treatises including instructions for the construction of an astrolabe which caused him to sometimes be credited as its inventor. As a historian, he wrote a detailed chronicle from the birth of Christ to his own present day, ordering them after the reckoning of the Christian era. It was later extended by his pupil Berthold of Reichenau. He was renowned as a religious poet and musical composer. Among his surviving works are officia for St. Afra and St. Wolfgang. When he went blind in later life, he began writing hymns. He was famous enough that he appears to have been credited with compositions by later writers; among the works traditionally attributed to him are the Salve Regina (\\"Hail Queen\\"), Veni Sancte Spiritus (\\"Come Holy Spirit\\"), and Alma Redemptoris Mater (\\"Nourishing Mother of the Redeemer\\"). Herman died on Reichenau on September 24, 1054, aged 41. The Roman Catholic Church beatified him in 1863.

The phrase \\"endowment mortgage\\" is used mainly in the United Kingdom by lenders and consumers to refer to this arrangement and is not a legal term. The borrower has two separate agreements: one with the lender for the mortgage, and one with the insurer for the endowment policy. The arrangements are distinct and the borrower can change either arrangement if they wish. In the past the endowment policy was often taken as an additional security by the lender. That is, the lender applied a legal device to ensure the proceeds of the endowment were made payable to them rather than the borrower; typically the policy is assigned to the lender. This practice is uncommon now.  Reasons for an endowment mortgage  The customer pays only the interest on the capital borrowed, thus reducing the monthly payments in comparison with an ordinary repayment loan; the borrower also pays premiums into an endowment life-assurance policy. The intention is that the payout from the endowment policy when it matures will be sufficient to repay the mortgage at the end of the term, and possibly create a cash surplus. Up to 1984 qualifying insurance contracts (including endowment policies) received tax relief on the premiums known as life assurance premium relief (LAPR). This gave a tax advantage for endowment mortgages over repayment. Similarly MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source) made having a larger mortgage advantageous as the MIRAS relief reduced as a repayment mortgage was repaid. This tax incentivisation toward endowment mortgages is not often commented on in the media when they discuss endowment mortgages. An additional reason in favour of an endowment was that many lenders charge interest on an annual basis. This meant that any capital repaid on a monthly basis is not removed from the outstanding loan until the end of the year thus increasing the real rate of interest charged. In such a situation, payments into an endowment might benefit from any growth from the moment it is invested. Henceforth, the net investment return required for the endowment to pay the loan, would be less than the average mortgage interest rate over the same period.  Traded endowment policies  Traded endowment policies (TEPs) or second hand endowment policies (SHEPs) are traditional with-profits endowments that have been sold to a new owner part way through their term. The TEP market enables buyers (investors) to buy unwanted endowment policies for more than the surrender value offered by the insurance company. Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. When a policy is sold, all beneficial rights on the policy are transferred to the new owner. The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies, no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover. The TEP market deals exclusively with Traditional With Profits policies. The easiest way of determining whether an endowment policy is in this category is to check to see whether it mentions units, indicating it is a Unitised With Profits or Unit Linked policy, if bonuses are in sterling and there is no mention of units then it is probably a traditional With Profits. The other types of policies - ‚ÄúUnit Linked‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnitised With Profits‚Äù have a performance factor which is dependent directly on current investment market conditions. These are not tradable as the guarantees on the policy are much lower and there is no gap between the surrender value and the market value.  Problems with endowment mortgages  The underlying premise with endowment policies being used to repay a mortgage, is that the premiums plus growth of the investment will be adequate to repay the loan when it falls due. Toward the end of the 1980s when endowment mortgage selling was at its peak, the anticipated growth rate for endowments policies was high (7-12% per annum). By the middle of the 1990s the change in the economy toward lower inflation made the assumptions of a few years ago look optimistic. Significantly, endowment mortgages continued to grow in the 1980s even after life assurance premium relief had been abolished in 1984. Moreover, their share of the mortgage market held up in the 1990s despite the fact that the Treasury began to steadily reduce MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source), which also worked in favour of interest- only mortgages, and despite a prolonged period of relatively low inflation (something which worked against interest only mortgages). The fact that endowment mortgages were later found to have been systematically mis-sold probably explains this disjunction.Fooks, G. (2003) \\"In the Valley of the Blind the One-Eyed Man Is King: Corporate Crime and the Myopia of Financial Regulation\\" in S. Tombs and D. Whyte (eds) Unmasking the Crimes of the Powerful. New York: Peter Lang Regulation of investment advice and a growing awareness of the potential for regulatory action against the insurers lead to a reduction in anticipated growth rates down to 7.5% and eventually as low as 4% per annum. By 2001 the sale of endowments to repay a mortgage was virtually seen as taboo. =Shortfalls= Financial regulations introduced compulsory re-projection letters to show existing endowment holders what the likely maturity value of their endowment would be assuming standard growth rates. This, in turn, led to a dramatic rise in complaints of mis-selling and spawned a secondary industry that 'handles' complaints on behalf of consumers for a fee, even though they can pursue it themselves for free. In many cases, because risk warnings were not made as clearly as they are in today's investment market, courts have found against the insurer or broker responsible for the original advice and have required them to restore their customers to the financial position they would have been in had they taken out a repayment mortgage instead. As of July 2006, UK banks and insurance providers have paid out approximately ¬£2.2 billion in compensation.icWales Mortgage Broker Arizona References External links * Information from the Financial Ombudsman Service * FSA Endowment Mortgage Complaints Category:Mortgage ","title":"Endowment mortgage"},{"id":"858818","text":"Maple Plain can refer to a community in the United States: *Maple Plain, Minnesota, a city *Maple Plain, Wisconsin, a town ","title":"Maple Plain"},{"id":"858819","title":"Bang Kruai District"},{"id":"858820","text":"Maple Grove may refer to: Places ;Canada * Maple Grove, Nova Scotia * Maple Grove, Ontario (disambiguation), several locations * Maple Grove, Quebec ;United States * Maple Grove, California * Maple Grove, Illinois * Maple Grove, Benzie County, Michigan, a census-designated place * Maple Grove, Minnesota, a city * Maple Grove, Missouri, an unincorporated community * Maple Grove (Poughkeepsie, New York) * Maple Grove, Ohio, an unincorporated community * Maple Grove, Berks County, Pennsylvania * Maple Grove, Utah, a former populated place in the west side of the Round Valley in eastern Millard County at base of the Pahvant Range * Maple Grove, Virginia * Maple Grove, Washington * Maple Grove, Wisconsin (disambiguation), multiple locations Other uses * Maple Grove (St. Joseph, Missouri), a historic house * Maple Grove Raceway, a dragstrip in Mohnton, Pennsylvania See also *Maple Grove Township (disambiguation) ","title":"Maple Grove"},{"id":"858821","text":"Old German usually refers to Old High German, but it could also refer to: * Altdeutsche Tracht (old German dress), a dress style popular among early 19th- century German radicals * brands of beer produced by brewing companies, including Iron City Brewing Company and (formerly) Yuengling * Old Low German (Old Saxon), a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German ","title":"Old German (disambiguation)"},{"id":"858827","text":"Duck and Cover is a civil defense social guidance film that is often popularly mischaracterized as propaganda.

The film was funded by the US Federal Civil Defense Administration and released in January 1952. At the time, the Soviet Union was engaged in nuclear testing and the US was in the midst of the Korean War. The film was written by Raymond J. Mauer, directed by Anthony Rizzo of Archer Productions, narrated by actor Robert Middleton, and made with the help of schoolchildren from New York City and Astoria, New York. The film is now in the public domain, and is widely available through Internet sources such as YouTube, as well as on DVD. It was selected by the National Film Registry for preservation in 2004 for being \\"culturally, historically, or esthetically significant.\\" Plot summary Full film from the Library of Congress The film starts with an animated sequence, showing an anthropomorphic turtle walking down a road, while picking up a flower and smelling it. A chorus sings the Duck and Cover theme: The significant scene before Bert ducks and covers.Under the theme, Bert is shown being attacked by a monkey holding a lit firecracker or stick of dynamite on the end of a string. Bert ducks into his shell in the nick of time, as the charge goes off and destroys both the monkey and the tree in which he is sitting. Bert, however, is shown perfectly safe, because he ducked and covered. The film then switches to live footage, as narrator Middleton explains what children should do \\"when you see the flash\\" of an atomic bomb. The movie goes on to suggest that by ducking down low in the event of a nuclear explosion, (crawling under desks and covering their necks with clasped hands) the children would be safer than they would be standing, and explains some basic survival tactics for nuclear war (facing any wall that might lend protection). The last scene of the film returns to animation in which Bert the Turtle (voiced by Carl Ritchie) summarily asks what everybody should do in the event of an atomic bomb flash and is given the correct answer by a group of unseen children. Purpose After nuclear weapons were developed (the first having been developed during the Manhattan Project during World War II), it was realized what kind of danger they posed. The United States held a nuclear monopoly from the end of World War II until 1949, when the Soviets detonated their first nuclear device. This signaled the beginning of the nuclear stage of the Cold War, and as a result, strategies for survival were thought out. Fallout shelters, both private and public, were built, but the government still viewed it as necessary to explain to citizens both the danger of the atomic (and later, hydrogen) bombs, and to give them some sort of training so that they would be prepared to act in the event of a nuclear strike. The solution was the duck and cover campaign, of which Duck and Cover was an integral part. Shelters were built, drills were held in towns and schools, and the film was shown to schoolchildren. According to the United States Library of Congress (which declared the film \\"historically significant\\" and inducted it for preservation into the National Film Registry in 2004), it \\"was seen by millions of schoolchildren in the 1950s.\\" Other media The song \\"Bert the Turtle (Duck and Cover)\\", performed by Dick Baker, was released as a commercial recording by Coral Records and accompanied by a color campaign pamphlet. It sold three million copies. Accuracy and usefulness Test shot Nectar of Operation Castle produced a yield of 1.69 megatons. Note the distinctive near instantaneous double flash, with the second being brighter than the sun, and the blast wave slowly, by comparison, spreading out turning the calm Elugelab ocean water a frothy white as it passes. The maximum average nuclear fireball radius is approximately . The outdoor blast and thermal burn LD50s would be 8 and 12 km respectively. Assuming personnel did not take any prompt countermeasures. Many historians and the nuclear disarmament public at large have generally sought to mock and dismiss civil defense advice as mere propaganda, including Amy Lutrell, who argues the film was made primarily as an American red scare political tool, to make children frightened of the Soviet Union and communism. Detailed scientific research programs lay behind the much-mocked UK government civil defense pamphlets of the 1950s and 1960s, including the advice to promptly duck and cover. The advice to duck and cover has made a resurgence in recent years with new scientific evidence to support it. While this (or any) tactic would be useless for someone at ground zero during a surface burst nuclear explosion, it would be beneficial to the vast majority of people who are positioned away from the blast hypocenter: both the thermal pulse of some weapons and the shrapnel from all weapons (particularly from shattered windows) could be evaded, at least in part. In particular, higher yield thermonuclear weapons have thermal pulses which last for several seconds.General Characteristics of Thermal Radiation from Chapter VII pg 314 of The Effects of Nuclear Weapons by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan (1977) By promptly putting something between yourself and the fireball during these crucial couple of seconds, you could avoid or reduce the severity of the burns you would have otherwise received. For those not at ground zero, like a shortened version of the delay between lightning and thunder, there would be a delay between the flash (indicating the need to duck and cover) and the arrival of the blast wave, which will shatter windows turning non-safety glass into missile-like shards, and cause other blast or impact injuries. To highlight the effect that being indoors can make, despite the lethal radiation & blast zone extending well past her position at Hiroshima,http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nukgr1.gif Akiko Takakura survived the effects of a 16 kt atomic bomb at a distance of 300 meters from the hypocenter, with only minor injuries, due in most part to her position in the lobby of the bank of Japan, a reinforced concrete building, at the time of the nuclear explosion. In contrast, the unknown person sitting outside, fully exposed, on the steps of the Sumitomo bank, next door to the bank of Japan, received third-degree burns and was then likely killed by the blast, in that order, within 2 seconds. The advice to cover one's head with anything available, like the picnic blanket and newspaper used by the family in the film, may seem absurd at first when one considers the capabilities of a nuclear weapon, but even a thin barrier such as cloth can reduce the severity of burns on the skin from the thermal radiation ‚Äì which is light rays in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared range, and it is this combination of light rays that delivers the burning energy to exposed skin areas; this burning thermal energy would be experienced by people within range for several seconds after the explosion.Field Manual No.1-111: Aviation Brigades (1997), Appendix C, p. 4. A photograph taken about 1.3 km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that even leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden telephone pole from charring discoloration due to thermal radiation, while the rest of the telephone pole not under the protection of the leaves was charred almost completely black. Depending on the yield and distance from the explosion the burst of ionizing radiation from the fireball would arrive at an observer's position at the same time as the light flash, leaving the observer little to no time to find cover from this aspect of a nuclear detonation, but subsequently some of this radiation is absorbed and re-emitted by heated fireball air molecules at lower wavelengths, so harmful ionizing radiation may continue for up to a minute during which time ducking and covering would go some way in limiting one's exposure.General Characteristics of Thermal Radiation from Chapter VII of The Effects of Nuclear Weapons by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan (1977) Alongside the misapprehension that all nuclear weapons have increased in yield to levels of the 50 Megaton Tsar Bomba, instead of the reality that the more militarily effective and numerous nuclear weapons are those akin to the W76 and Russian Bulava, which have a yield of approximately 100 to 200 kiloton(0.2 Megaton) and as it is these explosive devices that equip the submarine fleets of the US, Britain and Russia, it is therefore these explosive devices that are most likely to be encountered by civilians.Ch. 1: The Dangers from Nuclear Weapons: Myths and Facts - Nuclear War Survival Skills Today(1980s) few if any of Russia's huge intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are armed with a 20-megaton warhead. Now a huge Russian ICBM, the SS-18, typically carries 10 warheads, each having a yield of 500 kilotons, each programmed to hit a separate target. See Jane's Weapon Systems, 1987-88.] The other similarly common misapprehension or criticism of duck and cover that is frequently encountered is the opinion that prompt ionizing radiation effects would still kill those who duck and cover, regardless of any preventive measures taken. However this is generally incorrect when any nuclear weapon more powerful than 10‚Äì30 kilotons is detonated, and even in that case, if the person is indoors the absorbed radiation dose is again not life-threatening. For example, despite the film not being made in the era of megaton-range weapons, for exposed individuals taking no preventive countermeasures the range of harmful ionising radiation effects stays within a circle of radius 2‚Äì3 km from ground zero during airbursts of 1 megaton in yield, yet the blast range that would be expected to be lethal to 50% of people is 7.5 km, and the range of thermal effects lethal to 50% of people stretching out to 11 km from ground zero. Naturally, within this 3 km range from a 1-megaton airburst, the fatality rate would be near total for those caught in the open from the extreme blast pressure alone, before any potential radiation sickness could begin. However, for one caught in the open outside this ~3-kilometer radius from ground zero from a 1-megaton weapon, ducking and covering would drastically increase one's chance of survival, as at this range the radiation hazard is near zero, whereas that from the blast is a chance of 50% fatality at a ~7.5 km range and that of thermal effects 11 km. If someone was caught in the open, and by surprise, by the same 1-megaton weapon detonation, but ducked and covered in 2 seconds time from first noticing the moment of flash, then that person would have prevented themselves from being exposed to the full brunt of the 1-megaton explosion's thermal energy; instead, approximately 55% of the explosion's total thermal flash energy would have been absorbed over these 2 seconds.General Characteristics of Thermal Radiation from Chapter VII pg 314 graph on page. of The Effects of Nuclear Weapons by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan (1977) In this example, as there is now a 45% reduction in the amount of heat experienced by one ducking and covering, the median lethal thermal range from this 1-megaton weapon can now be more accurately described as equivalent to absorbing the entire flash energy from a 0.55 Mt or 550 kt weapon, if one ducks and covers in 2 seconds. Henceforth, one's chance of survival at 11 km goes from the previous 50% chance of death if they just stood there, gazing at the 1-megaton fireball as it emits all its energy over tens of seconds, to now a mere sunburn, or a 1st-degree burn injury on exposed skin. With the 50% lethal thermal range being thus downrated to being equivalent to a 550 kt explosion, the 50% lethal thermal radius goes from the previous 11 km without ducking and covering to ~7 km with prompt duck and covering within 2 seconds. One can think of this as going from a scenario were before the majority of people caught in the open, who just stood there staring at the fireball out to a radius of 11 km would probably die from lethal 3rd- degree burns on their unclothed skin, to a scenario now were instead the vast majority of people who 'duck and cover' from 7 km out to 11 km would remain alive, with generally non life-threatening 1st-degree burns and 2nd-degree burns over their exposed skin, with the burn severity naturally depending on their range from the explosion. Finally, all the lethal ranges given in the referenced graphs, and when discussing the range of Effects of nuclear explosions in general, one must keep in mind what is presented is the most pessimistic of weapon effects ranges. As the scaling laws these tables and graphs were derived from assume a simplistic flat terrain with no intervening skyscrapers or other objects that would attenuate the blast and provide shadowing from the thermal effects. When real world city terrain topography is included in these weapon effects calculations the lethal ranges are downgraded considerably. According to the 1946 book Hiroshima, in the days between the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs in Japan, one Hiroshima policeman went to Nagasaki to teach police about ducking after the atomic flash. As a result of this timely warning, not a single Nagasaki policeman died in the initial blast. This allowed more surviving Nagasaki police to organize relief efforts than in Hiroshima. Unfortunately, the general population was not warned of the heat/blast danger following an atomic flash because of the bomb's unknown nature. Many people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died while searching the skies for the source of the brilliant flash. Recent scientific analysis has largely supported the general idea of sheltering indoors in response to a nuclear explosion. Staying indoors can offer protection both from the initial blast as well as the following radioactive fallout that accumulates during the aftermath. Additionally, such a response would leave roads clear for emergency vehicles to access the area. This is termed the Shelter in place protocol, and together with emergency evacuation advice, they are the two countermeasures to take when the direct effects of nuclear explosions are no longer life- threatening and the need for protective shielding from coming in contact with nuclear weapon debris/fallout in the aftermath of the explosion, begins to become a concern. Historical context Video of shot MET (Military Effects Test) of Operation Teapot, fired on 15 April 1955, with a yield of 22 kilotons, typical of the yield of nuclear weapons when the film was first shown and approximately of the same yield and height of burst as the Fat Man bomb detonated over the city of Nagasaki in 1945. The United States' monopoly on nuclear weapons was broken by the Soviet Union in 1949 when it tested its first nuclear explosive (Joe-1), and with this many in the US government and public perceived that the nation was more vulnerable than it had ever been before. Duck-and-cover exercises quickly became a part of Civil Defense drills that every American citizen, from children to the elderly, practiced to be ready in the event of nuclear war. In 1950, during the first big Civil Defense push of the Cold War and coinciding with the Alert America! initiative to educate Americans on nuclear preparedness; The adult-orientated Survival Under Atomic Attack was published and contains \\"duck and Cover\\" or more accurately, cover-and-then-duck advice without using those specific terms in its Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks section. 1. Try To Get Shielded 2.Drop Flat On Ground Or Floor 3. Bury Your Face In Your Arms(\\"crook of your elbow\\"). The child-orientated Duck and Cover (film) was produced a year later by the Federal Civil Defense Administration in 1951. The adult-orientated Survival Under Atomic Attack issued in 1950, pre-dated the release of \\"Duck and Cover\\" in 1951-52. The Booklet was accompanied by a companion film by the same name. Education efforts on the effects of nuclear weapons proceeded with stops-and- starts in the US due to competing alternatives. In a once classified, 1950s era, US war game that looked at varying levels of war escalation, warning and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education. At the time however the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as lesser in effectiveness, in cost-benefit analysis than a ballistic missile defense (Nike Zeus) system, and as the Soviet adversary was believed to be rapidly increasing their nuclear stockpile, the efficacy of both would begin to enter a diminishing returns trend. When more became known about the cost and limitations of the Nike Zeus system, in the early 1960s the head of the department of defense determined once again that fallout shelters would save more Americans for far less money. The production of the Duck and Cover film in 1951 by the Federal Civil Defense Administration occurred during the height of the Korean War (1950-1953), and coincided with the first Desert Rock exercises in the Nevada desert which were designed to familiarize the US military with fighting alongside battlefield nuclear weapons, as it was feared that a resolution to the Korean War might need the theatre of operations to first expand across the border into the People's Republic of China and require nuclear weapons to end it. The film was also produced at least one year before the first \\"hydrogen bomb\\" or megaton range explosive device was demonstrated to be possible, with test shot Ivy Mike in 1952. At least four years before the first true \\"hydrogen bomb\\" of the Soviet Union (USSR), the RDS-37, on November 22, 1955, which yielded 1.6 megatons. About 6 years before the first successful test launch of the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Soviet Union's R-7 in 1957, up until this time strategic bombers were not but one of the three strategic nuclear triad delivery systems of the modern era but the sole intercontinental nuclear weapon delivery system capable of reaching the US from the Soviet Union and vice versa. Before advances in precision guided munitions and physics package miniaturization, \\"city busting\\" or countervalue targeting, was a more likely nuclear war scenario, as effective counterforce warfare with nuclear weapons had yet to become all that conceivable, with the potential exceptions of being used in roles where a low degree of accuracy would not result in a waste of a bomb, such as destroying large \\"rear area\\" military bases, aircraft carriers, Communist human wave attacks, massive mine fields in trench warfare (which was what the Korean War escalated into), radiological area denial and used at night prior to a frontal assault in the hopes of inducing widespread enemy troop flash blindness. Practically all other counterforce uses of this eras nuclear weapons would be ineffective due to force dispersal, weather factors, poor munition accuracy and the unwieldy physics packages of the nuclear weapons of the era, making them generally unfit for the mobile battlefield. This would therefore make it likely that combatants who have escalated to the point of contemplating nuclear exchanges would use their nuclear weapons on immobile and valuable targets, such as the war supporting infrastructure of cities. It is now estimated that it was not until after 1957 that the USSR attained more than about 50 nuclear munitions in its nuclear weapons arsenal. Almost all of this stockpile was likely designed to be air dropped by the Myasishchev M-4 and Tupolev Tu-4 bombers as strategic nuclear weapons on US and West European NATO cities respectively. As large numbers of small true tactical nuclear weapons only began to seriously populate the USSR's stockpile in the 1970s and beyond. Appearance in other media The 1982 film The Atomic Cafe, a satirical collage documentary film, uses footage from the Duck and Cover. Both films (the documentary in 2016) were inducted into the National Film Registry.\\"The Atomic Cafe\\" - 2016 additions to the National Film Registry - CBS News The video for \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's 1986 song 'Christmas at Ground Zero' features footage from the film, mostly during an instrumental break.

The 1999 Warner Brothers animated feature film, The Iron Giant, set in 1957, features a social guidance film-within-a-film titled, Atomic Holocaust, the style and tone of which parodies the film. In another instance, near the end of the feature film, the villainous character Kent Mansley suggests they duck and cover into a fallout shelter in response to an offshore nuclear SLBM Polaris missile being launched at their position by the USS Nautilus,Despite the fact that the USS Nautilus never had a complement of nuclear missiles and the first test launch of the Polaris occurred on the USS George Washington in 1960, three years after the date in which the movie is set. however all the other male adults in the vicinity claim that this would be of \\"no use\\", convincing bystanders and the young protagonist at the heart of the feature film to not attempt to evacuate to shelter.

It is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid, consisting of a vinyl group connected directly to a carboxylic acid terminus. This colorless liquid has a characteristic acrid or tart smell. It is miscible with water, alcohols, ethers, and chloroform. More than a million tons are produced annually. History The word \\"acrylic\\" was coined in 1843, for a chemical derivative of acrolein, an acrid-smelling oil derived from glycerol. Production Acrylic acid is produced by oxidation of propylene, which is a byproduct of the production of ethylene and gasoline: : CH2=CHCH3 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí CH2=CHCO2H + H2O = Historical methods = Because acrylic acid and its esters have long been valued commercially, many other methods have been developed. Most have been abandoned for economic or environmental reasons. An early method was the hydrocarboxylation of acetylene (\\"Reppe chemistry\\"): : 250px This method requires nickel carbonyl, high pressures of carbon monoxide, and acetylene, which is relatively expensive compared to propylene. Acrylic acid was once manufactured by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile, a material derived from propene by ammoxidation, but this route was abandoned because it cogenerates ammonium side products, which must be disposed of. Other now abandoned precursors to acrylic acid include ethenone and ethylene cyanohydrin. = Research = Propane is a significantly cheaper raw material than propylene, so one alternative route being explored is the one-step selective oxidation of propane. Carboxylating ethylene to acrylic acid under supercritical carbon dioxide condition is thermodynamically possible, but efficient catalysts have not been developed. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), an acrylic-acid precursor by dehydration, can be produced from sugars, but the process is not competitive.Sweet Deal: Dow and Partner Cook up Sugar-to- Acrylic Plan.

Retrieved on 2012-05-24. Reactions and uses Acrylic acid undergoes the typical reactions of a carboxylic acid. When reacted with an alcohol, it forms the corresponding ester. The esters and salts of acrylic acid are collectively known as acrylates (or propenoates). The most common alkyl esters of acrylic acid are methyl, butyl, ethyl, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. Acrylic acid and its esters readily combine with themselves (to form polyacrylic acid) or other monomers (e.g. acrylamides, acrylonitrile, vinyl compounds, styrene, and butadiene) by reacting at their double bond, forming homopolymers or copolymers, which are used in the manufacture of various plastics, coatings, adhesives, elastomers, as well as floor polishes and paints. Acrylic acid is a compound, which is used in many industries like the diaper industry, the water treatment industry or the textiles industry. On a worldwide scale the consumption rate of acrylic acid is projected to reach more than an estimated 8,000 kilotons, by 2020. This increase is expected to occur as a result of using this product in new applications, including personal care products, detergents and products that are used for adult incontinence. Substituents As a substituent acrylic acid can be found as an acyl group or a carboxyalkyl group, depending on the removal of the group from the molecule. More specifically, these are: # The acryloyl group, with the removal of the ‚àíOH from carbon-1. # The 2-carboxyethenyl group, with the removal of a ‚àíH from carbon-3. This substituent group is found in chlorophyll. Safety Acrylic acid is severely irritating and corrosive to the skin and the respiratory tract. Eye contact can result in severe and irreversible injury. Low exposure will cause minimal or no health effects, while high exposure could result in pulmonary edema. The is 340 mg/kg (rat, oral).

Biography  Berkeley was born on 12 May 1903 in Oxford, England, the younger child and only son of Aline Carla (1863‚Äì1935), daughter of Sir James Charles Harris, former British consul in Monaco, and Royal Navy Captain Hastings George FitzHardinge Berkeley (1855‚Äì1934), the illegitimate and eldest son of George Lennox Rawdon Berkeley, the 7th Earl of Berkeley (1827‚Äì1888). He attended the Dragon School in Oxford, going on to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk and St George's School in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He studied French at Merton College, Oxford, graduating with a fourth class degree in 1926. While at university he coxed the college rowing eight. He became an honorary fellow of Merton College in 1974. In 1927, he went to Paris to study music with Nadia Boulanger, and there became acquainted with Francis Poulenc, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger and Albert Roussel. Berkeley also studied with Maurice Ravel, often cited as a key influence in Berkeley's technical development as a composer. In 1936 he met Benjamin Britten, also a former pupil of Gresham's School, at the ISCM Festival in Barcelona. Berkeley fell in love with Britten, who appears to have been wary of entering a relationship, writing in his diary, \\"we have come to an agreement on that subject.\\" Nevertheless, the two composers shared a house for a year, living in the Old Mill at Snape, Suffolk, which Britten had acquired in July 1937. They subsequently enjoyed a long friendship and artistic association, collaborating on a number of works; these included the suite of Catalan dances titled Mont Juic, and Variations on an Elizabethan Theme (the latter also with four other composers). He worked for the BBC during the Second World War, where he met his future wife, Elizabeth Freda Bernstein (1923-2016) whom he married on 14 December 1946. Together they had three sons; their eldest son Michael Berkeley, Baron Berkeley of Knighton, is also a composer, and their youngest son is the photographer Nick Berkeley.Peter Dickinson The Music of Lennox Berkeley ‚Äì Page 77 2003 \\"Colin Horsley remembered Berkeley's time at the BBC because he was reputed to have kept manuscript paper under his desk and was obviously longing to get more time to compose.

His students included Richard Rodney Bennett, David Bedford, Clive Strutt, John Tavener and Brian Ferneyhough. Ferneyhough felt that he learned nothing from Berkeley because of the gap between their musical conceptions, remembering him as \\"a notably urbane and well-meaning presence\\" whose \\"Nadia Boulenger influenced gallic aesthetics were completely unable to deal with my compositional needs.\\"Brian Ferneyhough - An interview with the English composer/professor who now resides in California. \\"I am always actively thinking of current activities.\\".

Berkeley's contact and friendship with composers such as Ravel and Poulenc and his studies in Paris with Boulanger lend his music a 'French' quality, demonstrated by its \\"emphasis on melody, the lucid textures and a conciseness of expression\\". He maintained a negative view of atonal music at least up until 1948, when he wrote: However, from the mid-1950s, Berkeley apparently felt a need to revise his style of composition, later telling the Canadian composer, R. Murray Schafer that \\"it's natural for a composer to feel a need to enlarge his idiom.\\" He started including tone rows and aspects of serial technique in his compositions around the time of the Concertino, op. 49 (1955) and the opera Ruth (1955-6).

During the night of 22 April, Chinese forces launched their Spring Offensive which was intended to annihilate the British 29th Brigade as well as the US 3rd Infantry Division, thus enabling the capture of Seoul and delivering a crushing blow to UN forces in Korea.Salmon pp. 128‚Äì129 In what became known as the Battle of the Imjin River, Carne's Glosters and the rest of the British brigade were met by an onslaught of over 27,000 Chinese troops attacking in massed waves. Carne's leadership was instrumental in allowing the Gloster's to hold their ground during the attack during which the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC: By the morning of 24 April, Carne and the surviving Glosters gathered on Hill 235 where he received orders from 3rd Division commander General Soule that the Glosters were to hold their ground and await reinforcements.Salmon p. 187 These reinforcements, however, were forced to retreat just 2,000 yards (1,800 m) short of the Glosters' position, leaving the Glosters alone in trying to hold Hill 235 against an entire Chinese division.Salmon pp. 129, 203‚Äì206 Both sides fought fiercely throughout the night for control over the hill and by the morning of 25 April, the Glosters still held the hill but had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and no artillery support. Carne requested permission to attempt a breakout and ordered his men to split into small groups and make as best they could back to the British lines. Only 63 of his men would succeed in doing this with the rest of the battalion, including Carne, being either killed, captured or wounded.Salmon pp. 206‚Äì225 Despite the battalion's effective annihilation, the Gloster's stand earned them worldwide fame as The Glorious Glosters and had enabled the rest of the British and American forces to retreat before they too were overwhelmed.Salmon p. 314 =Prisoner of war= Lieutenant-Colonel James Carne VC pictured in 1953 after his return from the Korean War Carne fell into Chinese captivity after his 700-man battalion's astonishing resistance against an estimated 11,000 attackers was finally overcome. As the senior British officer among hundreds of prisoners kept in appalling conditions in camps in communist-held Korea, he was singled out for special treatment. While the other ranks were \\"re-educated\\" by the communist commissars at their camps, Carne was kept in solitary confinement.The Daily Telegraph, 8 November 2006 According to documents held at the National Archives in Kew and not made public until 2006, when Carne was released in September 1953 he told Sir Esler Dening, the British ambassador in Tokyo, \\"an extraordinary story\\" of brainwashing.Daily Telegraph \\"He says that between January 1952 and August this year he was kept in solitary confinement by Chinese communists and subjected to a softening-up process including the use of drugs, [the] result of which was, as he put it, to make his brain like a sponge, capable of receiving any kind of information put into it\\", Sir Esler told the Foreign Office in a \\"top secret\\" category telegram. The note, which was sent straight to Sir Winston Churchill, in his second term as Prime Minister, went on: \\"In March of this year, (i.e. about the time when the communists displayed a new interest in concluding an armistice) various thoughts were put in to his mind, and he remains convinced that he was meant to retain these and pass them on to Her Majesty's Government.\\" The thoughts comprised a peace deal not just to end the war in Korea, but to reach a settlement covering the whole Pacific region. Sir Esler opined: \\"The whole thing might be pure fantasy except for the fact that Colonel Carne could hardly have invented it and does not strike one as that sort of person.\\" The Foreign Office was sceptical about the plot, but suggested that perhaps its aim was to split Britain from its American ally.The Daily Telegraph 8 November 2006 Popular culture In 1954 it was announced that Warwick Productions wanted to make a film The Glorious Glosters starring Alan Ladd as Carne based on a script by Max Trell. However the film was never made. Carne was honoured by South Korea in 2015 when his image was featured on a South Korean stamp issued to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the start of the Korean War.

Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous 48 United States, is only to the northwest. The site itself consists of a small spring-fed pool of \\"bad water\\" next to the road in a sink; the accumulated salts of the surrounding basin make it undrinkable, thus giving it the name. The pool does have animal and plant life, including pickleweed, aquatic insects, and the Badwater snail. Adjacent to the pool, where water is not always present at the surface, repeated freeze‚Äìthaw and evaporation cycles gradually push the thin salt crust into hexagonal honeycomb shapes. The pool is not the lowest point of the basin: the lowest point (which is only slightly lower) is several miles to the west and varies in position, depending on rainfall and evaporation patterns. The salt flats are hazardous to traverse (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), and so the sign marking the low point is at the pool instead. The basin was considered the lowest elevation in the Western Hemisphere until the discovery of Laguna del Carb√≥n in Argentina at . Geography Badwater Basin elevation sign View of the Basins's salt flats At Badwater Basin, significant rainstorms flood the valley bottom periodically, covering the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water. Newly formed lakes do not last long though, because the of average rainfall is overwhelmed by a annual evaporation rate. This is the greatest evaporation potential in the United States, meaning that a lake could dry up in a single year. When the basin is flooded, some of the salt is dissolved; it is redeposited as clean crystals when the water evaporates. A popular site for tourists is the sign marking \\"sea level\\" on the cliff above the Badwater Basin. Crust of hexagonal shapes History The current best understanding of the area's geological history is that the entire region between the Colorado River in the east and Baja California in the southwest (and bordered by various uplifts and mountains around the west- northwest-northern perimeters) has seen numerous cycles since at least the start of the Pleistocene (and perhaps up to 3 Ma) of pluvial lakes of varying size in a complex cycle mainly tied to changing climate patterns (particularly, glaciation during the numerous recent Ice Age cycles), but also influenced by the progressive depositing of alluvial plains and deltas by the Colorado River (cf. Salton Sea), alternating with periodic water body breakthroughs and rearrangements due to erosion and the proximity of the San Andreas Fault. This has resulted in a high number of evaporating and reforming endorheic lakes throughout the Quaternary Period in the area, with an intertwined history of various larger bodies of water subsuming smaller ones during water table maxima and the subsequent splitting and disappearance thereof during the evaporative part of the cycles. Although these local cycles are now somewhat modified by human presence, their legacy persists; despite appearances much to the contrary, Death Valley actually sits atop one of the largest aquifers in the world. Throughout the Quaternary's wetter spans, streams running from nearby mountains filled Death Valley, creating Lake Manly, which during its greatest extents was approximately 80 mi (130 km) long and up to 600 ft (180 m) deep. Numerous evaporation cycles and a lack of outflow caused an increasing hypersalinity, typical for endorheic bodies of water. Over time, this hypersalinization, combined with sporadic rainfall and occasional aquifer intrusion, has resulted in periods of \\"briny soup\\", or salty pools, on the lowest parts of Death Valley's floor. Salts (95% table salt ‚Äì NaCl) began to crystallize, coating the surface with the thick crust, ranging from , now observable at the basin floor. Badwater Basin panorama The Timbisha tribe of Native Americans, formerly known as the Panamint Shoshone, were the original inhabitants of the Badwater Basin area. They have inhabited the valley for at least the past millennium.

The same musicians recorded both records, though none are credited on the album cover. In 2016, Chance released his first single with his original Contortions band in nearly 30 years, entitled \\"Melt Yourself Down\\". A music video for the single was directed, filmed and animated by 19 year old Dylan Greenberg and is considered the first Contortions music video to make significant use of dramatic digital effects, such as Chance's face being manipulated to appear as if it were melting.

History Founded by Charles Duryea and his brother Frank, the company built the Duryea Motor Wagon, a one-cylinder four horsepower car,, first demonstrated on September 21, 1893, in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Taylor Street in Metro Center. It is considered the first successful gas- engine vehicle built in the U.S. Reading, PA, \\"where Duryea first proved automobiles could consistently climb mountains\\" In 1895, a second Duryea (built in 1894), driven by Frank, won the Chicago Times Herald race in Chicago on a snowy Thanksgiving day. He travelled 54 miles (87 km) at an average 7.5 mph (12 km/h), marking the first U.S. auto race in which any entrants finished. That same year, the brothers began commercial production, with thirteen cars sold by the end of 1896. Their first ten production vehicles were the first automobiles sold in the United States. Banking on the idea that future racing successes would propel their market share, the brothers entered two vehicles in Britain's London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Frank placed first and beat out the nearest competition by 75 minutes. The brothers went their separate ways by the end of the century, over a dispute for financing that would have required moving the company to Detroit. Frank helped produce the Stevens-Duryea (at gun maker Stevens) until 1927, while Charles produced Duryea vehicles as late as 1917. Based in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon for residents to see him motoring a brand new automobile from City Park out to Mount Penn, managing the switchback road as a final test of durability and refinement. Charles Duryea moved to Reading in February 1900. By 1901, Duryea and Sternbergh incorporated the Duryea Power Company \\"for the manufacture of iron, steel, bath, any metal or wood or both, including automobiles, motors, propellers, and part of either.\\" By March 1902, after overcoming difficulties procuring factory space, and a devastating flood of the Schuylkill River, Duryea was manufacturing one three-wheel, three- cylinder, gasoline powered automobile each week. Most buyers were doctors, who enjoyed the power, reliability, and heady 20 mile-an-hour top speed of his vehicles. 1899 Duryea on display at the Henry Ford Museum By 1905, Duryea's fifty workers were manufacturing sixty cars a year, including the four-wheel Phaeton, which soon sold for $1,600. Duryea's automobiles were a success, but a fight among the company's partners led to collapse of the business in 1907. Undaunted, Charles Duryea designed a new automobile with significant design innovations, including a two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, which he named the \\"Buggyaut.\\" Manufactured in a garage at 32 Carpenter St., the Buggyaut was an inexpensive auto with large wheels designed for rural markets and unpaved roads. To make the car affordable, Duryea introduced a simple body design, mounted on the side bars of the chassis, in usual buggy fashion, that made the Buggyaut light and easy riding. The two-passenger model, complete with top, sold for only $700, but the Buggyaut never achieved the success that he had envisioned. In 1914, Duryea closed the garage and left Reading. In 1916, eight years after Henry Ford introduced his Model T, Duryea made another attempt to produce his own \\"car for the people.\\" With financing from Keyser Fry of Reading, he created the Duryea GEM, a cross between an automobile and a motorcycle, with a newly designed engine and suspension. Advertised as the \\"Biggest Idea in the History of the Motor Car and the Last Word in Automobile Construction,\\" the Duryea GEM combined the comfort and stability of an automobile with the simplicity, handling, and economy of a motorcycle. It was also extremely affordable, costing only $250 and boasting an impressive 65 miles of driving per gallon of gasoline. Once again, however, lack of funding forced Duryea to drop the project, with only six being thought to have been built. The GEM was the last automobile built by Charles Duryea. Although Charles did discuss with Frank Duryea the building of the first commercially successful American automobile, Frank was the actual builder during their collaboration. He did correspond with his brother Charles regarding what did and did not work in the design. Charles left Springfield in 1892 before construction began. This was documented in transcripts during the Selden Patent trial. Boyertown Museum of Historic Vehicles in Boyertown, Pennsylvania hosts an annual Duryea Day Antique and Classic Car Show, which features an extensive collection of automobiles manufactured in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 20th century. Since 1951, the SCCA has sponsored a biannual \\"Duryea Hillclimb\\" race in Reading which traces Charles' original test route.

Curtis was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Imjin in the Korean War. Military career Curtis joined the British Army in 1944, and was commissioned into The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a second lieutenant on 3 May 1946.London Gazette Curtis was a 24-year-old lieutenant in The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry attached to the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment during the Korean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Battle of Imjin. On 22/23 April 1951 near the Imjin River, Korea, during a heavy enemy attack, No. 1 platoon under the command of Lieutenant Curtis, was ordered to carry out a counter-attack which was initially successful, but was eventually held up by heavy fire and grenades. The lieutenant then ordered some of his men to give covering fire while he himself rushed the main position of resistance. In this charge he was severely wounded but he insisted on making a second attempt. While making another desperate charge he was killed when within a few yards of his objective after throwing a grenade which destroyed the enemy position immediately after. Anthony Farrar-Hockley, one of Britain's most famous soldiers of the twentieth century, was a participant at the Imjin River battle. He was witness to Lieutenant Curtis' gallant deed, a desperate counterattack to regain a key position lost to the Chinese advance. At sunrise a Chinese attack was repulsed, but the British position was untenable. Below is part of Farrar- Hockley's account. The medal His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry Museum in Bodmin, Cornwall. Citation The War Office, 1st December 1953: The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Lieutenant Philip Kenneth Edward Curtis (365680), The Duke of Cornwall‚Äôs Light Infantry, attached The Gloucestershire Regiment, in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Korea. During the first phase of the Battle of the Imjin River on the night of 22nd/23rd April 1951, ‚ÄúA‚Äù Company, 1 Glosters, was heavily attacked by a large enemy force. By dawn on 23rd April, the enemy had secured a footing on the ‚ÄúCastle Hill‚Äô site in very close proximity to No. 2 Platoon‚Äôs position. The Company Commander ordered No. 1 Platoon, under the command of Lieutenant CURTIS, to carry out a counter-attack with a view to dislodging the enemy from the position. Under the covering of medium machine guns, the counterattack, gallantly led by Lieutenant CURTIS, gained initial success but was eventually held up by heavy fire and grenades. Enemy from just below the crest of the hill were rushed to reinforce the position and a fierce fire-fight developed, grenades also being freely used by both sides in this close quarter engagement. Lieutenant CURTIS ordered some of his men to give him covering fire while he himself rushed the main position of resistance; in this charge Lieutenant CURTIS was severely wounded by a grenade. Several of his men crawled out and pulled him back under cover but, recovering himself, Lieutenant CURTIS insisted on making a second attempt. Breaking free from the men who wished to restrain him, he made anther desperate charge, hurling grenades as he went, but was killed by a burst of fire when within a few yards of his objective. Although the immediate objective of this counter-attack was not achieved, it had yet a great effect on the subsequent course of the battle; for although the enemy had gained a footing on a position vital to the defence of the whole Company area, this success had resulted in such furious reaction that they made no further effort to exploit their success in this immediate area; had they done so, the eventual withdrawal of the Company might well have proved impossible. Lieutenant CURTIS‚Äôs conduct was magnificent throughout this bitter battle.

The early Velo had a 1L engine, and later a engine. giving a top speed of 12 mph (20 km/h). The Velo was officially introduced by Karl Benz as the Velocipede, and became the world's first large-scale production car. The Velocipede remained in production between 1894 and 1902, with a final count of over 1,200 produced. Preceding Events Carl Benz patented the world's first stationary, static Internal combustion engine. His patent created a great demand for his vehicles, forcing Benz to move his operations in 1886 to a new factory on Waldhofstrasse in Mannheim (operating until 1908). Benz had appointed a Board of Management to help aid his growing company. The appointees suggested to Benz that he should create a less-expensive automobile suitable for mass production. In response, Benz engineered a two-passenger automobile with a engine, which he called the Victoria. That model could reach a top speed of , and utilized a pivotal front-axle operated by a roller-chained tiller for steering. 85 units of the Victoria were produced. Improving on those designs, Benz created his Benz Velo. Influences =Following Automobiles= The Velo also inspired numerous copies, including Marshall (later Belsize) in Manchester,G.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930. (London: Grange- Universal, 1990), p.24 caption. Star (Wolverhampton),G.N. Georgano, p.24 caption. and Arnold (Paddock Wood, of which only twelve were built). Benz's Velo was particularly popular in France, where a Parisian bicycle manufacturer by the name of √âmile Roger had been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz. Roger began building Benz automobiles as well, and as a result, a majority of Benz automobiles were sold in France initially. Many British Inventors also used Benz's patents and automobiles as starting points for their own innovations. Frederick W. Lanchester, of Birmingham, built a four- wheeled petrol-driven automobile, similar to units previously designed by Benz, which had utilized an electric starter (an adaption first seen in the Benz Velo). A Velo was the first car introduced to South Africa, where it was demonstrated to then President Paul Kruger on 4 January 1897. =The First Automobile Race= Karl Benz's Velo participated in the world's first automobile race. A Parisian daily newspaper, by the name of Le Petit Journal, organized the race. The editors of Le Petit intended to display horseless carriages as a viable means of transportation. Rather than fastest time, the automobiles would be judged on whether they were safe and cost effective to operate. It took place in 1894, starting in Paris and ending in Rouen. The winners of the Paris-Rouen race were Panhard & Levassor (Panhard) and Peugeot, both French manufacturers using Benz internal combustion engines. The Velo placed fifth overall in Le Petit's race. Benz had proven with this race that his engines and his automobiles were not only attainable but also safe and reliable to operate. Eventually, manufacturers began optimizing automobile design for racing. In addition to promoting Benz and his automobiles, the Paris-Rouen race gave birth to modern Motorsport, which now includes the likes of Formula One.

The southern terminus for US 151 is at a junction with Interstate 80 (I-80) in Iowa County, Iowa, and its northern terminus is at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The route, from south to north follows a northeasterly path through the two states. Approximately south of Dubuque, Iowa, US 151 joins with US 61\\\\. The two highways share a route from there to Dickeyville, Wisconsin. south of Dubuque, US 61/US 151 joins with US 52 and shares a route with US 52 until it veers south in Key West. In Wisconsin, US 61/US 151 joins with Wisconsin Highway 35 (WIS 35) about north of the Iowa‚ÄìWisconsin border. At Dickeyville, US 151 splits off and heads northeast to Platteville. US 61/WIS 35 continues north. US 151 later joins with US 18 near Dodgeville. The two highways share a route all the way to Madison. Route description =Iowa= US 151 starts at an intersection with I-80 in an isolated part of Iowa near both Williamsburg and Conroy. It then continues through the area around the Amana Colonies, where it has a brief overlap with US 6\\\\. Once meeting up with US 30 and US 218, the route cuts around the city of Cedar Rapids, while Business US 151 goes through the city. The route splits from the other roads and continues toward Dubuque as an expressway. This stretch crosses many major rivers including both the Wapsipinicon and the Maquoketa. The road eventually goes into the Driftless Area where it meets up with US 61 around the Dubuque Regional Airport. US 52 briefly joins the two routes, concurrently, for two miles south of Dubuque. The combined road then heads into the state of Wisconsin. =Dubuque to Madison= US 61/US 151 crosses the Mississippi River into Wisconsin via the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge from Dubuque, Iowa and passes through a cut in the river ridge before turning northward to the western terminus of WIS 11 after of due east travel. WIS 35 and the Great River Road join the route at that interchange, heading north. The highway at this point is limited access highway with two lanes in each direction. The northward trek of the route passes through mixed residential and farmland as it crosses Badger Road and merges with Eagle Point Road. Eagle Point road merges with US 151 from the left side of the road. The limited access portion ends at this interchange. Another pair of half diamond interchanges connect the highway with County Trunk Highway HHH (CTH-HHH) and CTH-H as it bypasses Kieler to the northwest. At Dickeyville, US 61, WIS 35 and the Great River Road route exit north off of US 151 into town. US 151 passes Dickeyville to the east and descends into a valley cut northeast of the village, paralleling the Little Platte River and Blockhouse Creek within the valley for a stretch before climbing back onto the ridge top on the other side of the valley. US 151 then approaches Platteville and enters a section of limited access at CTH-D (US 151 Business). The limited access stretch ends after three interchanges to the east. The last of the interchanges is WIS 126/CTH-G with access to Belmont. The route turns northeastward from this point, crosses the Cottage Inn Branch and begins the first of several descents into valleys, two of which are prior to passing Mineral Point and another two while passing the city. The highway is limited access between the two interchanges that provide access to Mineral Point: CTH-O and WIS 23\\\\. WIS 23 joins US 151 heading northbound at that point until the first interchange at Dodgeville. This interchange begins another short stretch of freeway to the point where US 18 joins the route. US 18/US 151 heads eastbound past that interchange. The section of expressway past Dodgeville passes through rolling hills populated with farmland mixed with small woodlands. The highway passes Ridgeway and Barneveld. Access to Ridgeway is by an interchange and a surface intersection with a short business route on CTH-HHH. The interchange was previously an intersection; however, it was announced in 2011 that the first intersection would be closed, and an exit would be constructed, due to the numerous fatal accidents that happen at the intersection each year. The new interchange on the western end of town opened in late 2018. Access to Barneveld is at an interchange with CTH-ID and an at- grade intersection with CTH-K. CTH-ID parallels US 18/US 151 for the entire stretch between Barneveld and Mount Horeb. A section of freeway begins at WIS 78 and ends at the other end of CTH-ID as the highway bypasses Mount Horeb just to the south of the city's passing residential subdivisions. A mix of grade separation and level intersections cross the winding highway as it continues eastward until the interchange with CTH-MV (Verona Avenue) begins a section of freeway that bypasses Verona to the south. This section provides access to four interchanges including the two endpoints of CTH-MV. The freeway continues into Fitchburg and provides access to two interchanges at CTH-PD (McKee Road) and Williamsburg Way. The freeway then ends. The road continues as an urban multilane highway known as Verona Road as it enters Madison. Verona Road passes through a residential and commercial area on the Southwest Side of Madison. US 18 and US 151 merge east on the West Beltline Highway‚Äîjoining US 12 and US 14. =Madison metropolitan area= The four US Highways run concurrently for about to Park Street. At this interchange, US 14 turns south off the beltline towards Oregon, and US 151 turns north and into central Madison; US 151 passes Monona Bay to the west along South Park Street. US 151 turns northeast onto West Washington Avenue for about then follows Proudfit Street and North Shore Drive‚Äîparalleling the Monona Bay shore‚Äîand turns north onto John Nolen Drive. The street passes under the Monona Terrace Convention Center as it passes to the south and east of downtown Madison. US 151 turns northwest onto South Blair Street for three city blocks to East Washington Avenue‚Äîwhere it turns northeast and follows East Washington Avenue, bisecting the Madison Isthmus, and leading out of the city to the east. The western terminus of WIS 30 meets US 151 about northeast of the South Blair Street turn. and US 51 crosses US 151 further northeast. =Madison to Fond du Lac= US 45 exit ramp in Fond du Lac At a cloverleaf interchange with I-39/I-90/I-94, a section of freeway begins and continues along US 151 northeast through commercial zones into residential areas. The route bypasses Sun Prairie on the west and north sides through the city's residential zones. After Sun Prairie, US 151 passes through farmland, heading toward Columbus. The highway bypasses the city via a partial beltline to the north and east, completely clearing the city. WIS 16 and WIS 60 crosses under US 151 about midway along the Columbus bypass. US 151 becomes an expressway with level intersections after the interchange with WIS 73 at the end of the bypass portion. The route becomes a freeway at Beaver Dam, bypassing the city to the southeast. The route follows the edge of residential zones of the city before passing an industrial area at the northeastern end of the bypass. Within this freeway section exists a level railroad crossing near CTH-E (East Burnett Street). US 151 crosses at-grade intersections after the interchange with CTH-A northeast of Beaver Dam and encounters one more freeway section at Waupun, bypassing the city to the east. The Waupun bypass also includes a level railroad crossing halfway between the CTH-M and WIS 26 interchanges. The four-lane expressway of US 151 continues east, bypassing Fond du Lac to the south and east. This expressway provides a mixture of at-grade intersections and grade-separated interchanges at I-41/US& 41 and WIS 23. WisDOT currently is studying upgrades to two sections of US 151\\\\. The first study would preserve the Fond du Lac Bypass from I-41 to WIS 23, with the ultimate goal being freeway conversion. The second study is examining freeway upgrades to the route from WIS 73 in Columbus to WIS 49 in Waupun. =Fond du Lac to Manitowoc= The northeast terminus at US 10 in Manitowoc The multi-lane section of US 151 ends after turning north away from Fond du Lac and the route follows the east shore of Lake Winnebago for about half the length of the shoreline. US 151 then turns east at the intersection with WIS 55 and follows two-lane surface roads and briefly running concurrently with WIS 32 and WIS 57 in Chilton. The roadway passes through farmland throughout this section until it crosses over I-43 and enters Manitowoc. The route follows surface streets into Manitowoc and terminates in the downtown area at US 10 just blocks prior to the SS Badger car ferry dock. History US 151, approximately south of Dubuque, Iowa; a scene from the movie Field of Dreams was filmed on this particular segment of the highway. US 151 was one of the original U.S. Highways from 1926. At the time, it only ran from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to Madison. Originally, the highway ended at Western Avenue and Main Street in Madison. In 1934, the highway was extended southwest to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, incorporating the full length of former U.S. Highway 118 (Dodgeville to Dickeyville) and part of former U.S. Highway 161 (Dubuque to Cedar Rapids; US 161 from Cedar Rapids south to Keokuk became US 218). At the time, the southern end of the route was at Williams Blvd SW and 16th Ave SW, what was then US 30 and US 218\\\\. In the 1940s, the highway was extended northeast to Manitowoc. =Illinois= The Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge, Dubuque, Iowa. The bridge crosses the Mississippi River between Dubuque and Grant County, Wisconsin. The bridge is part of the US 61 / US 151 route. In 1969, the Eagle Point Bridge, which connected US 151 and US 61 with Wisconsin, was closed, and those highways were rerouted over the Julien Dubuque Bridge with US 20 from Dubuque to East Dubuque, Illinois. The route then followed Illinois Route 35 and WIS 35 north to what is now the current highway. In 1982, the Dubuque- Wisconsin Bridge opened, the old Eagle Point Bridge was demolished, and US 151 and US 61 were rerouted onto the new bridge. This is the only instance of US 61 and US 151 entering Illinois. =Routings= In 1981, the southern terminus of the highway was extended once again when the US 30 bypass was built. The southern terminus was at the US 151 and 30 interchange. By 1986, the main US 151 was rerouted onto state highway 13 and US 30 to bypass Cedar Rapids. The previous route through Cedar Rapids was renamed US 151 Business (though the official state designation for it is Iowa 922). Finally, in 1989, US 151 was extended to its current southern end at exit 225 along I-80. This extension followed the old route of Iowa 149\\\\. As a result, US 151 became the main route through the Amana Colonies.

Life Little of al-BattƒÅnƒ´'s life is known other than his birthplace in Harran near Urfa, in Upper Mesopotamia, (today in Turkey) and his father's fame as a maker of scientific instruments. Ibn Khallikan expresses ignorance on the question of his Muslim faith, and points out that his epithet a·π£-·π¢abi‚Äô suggests possible Sabian-sect ancestry. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition stated that he had noble origins as an Arab prince, but traditional Arabic biographers make no mention of this. Between 877 and 918/19, over a forty-year period, he lived in the ancient city of Raqqa, in north central Syria, recording his astronomical observations. He is said to have died while returning to BaghdƒÅd at a fortress called Kasr al-Hadr, which was near either Tikrit, or Samarra. Astronomy One of al-BattƒÅnƒ´'s best-known achievements in astronomy was the determination of the solar year as being 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and 24 seconds, which is only 2 minutes and 22 seconds off. The twelfth-century Egyptian encyclopedist al-Qif·π≠ƒ´, in his biographical history Ta‚Äôrƒ´kh al-·∏§ukamƒÅ‚Äô, mentions al-BattƒÅnƒ´‚Äôs contribution to advances in astronomical observation and calculations based on Ptolemy‚Äôs Almagest. Al- BattƒÅnƒ´ amended some of Ptolemy's results and compiled new tables of the Sun and Moon, long accepted as authoritative. Some of his measurements were more accurate than ones taken by Copernicus many centuries later and some ascribe this phenomenon to al-BattƒÅnƒ´'s location lying closer to the equator such that the ecliptic and the Sun, being higher in the sky, are less susceptible to atmospheric refraction. Al-BattƒÅnƒ´ observed that the direction of the Sun's apogee, as recorded by Ptolemy, was changing. Al-BattƒÅnƒ´'s work was instrumental in the development of science and astronomy. Copernicus, in his book that initiated the Copernican Revolution, the De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, quotes his name no fewer than 23 times, and also mentions him in the Commentariolus. Tycho Brahe, Riccioli, Kepler, Galileo and others frequently cited him or his observations. His data is still used in geophysics.Dalmau, W.

Biography He was born in the town of Mogilev in the Russian Empire, in what is now Belarus. His father was a descendant of German settlers in Courland, while his mother was a Latvian. In 1912-13 while in university he published a number of mathematical works on group theory which laid foundation for Krull‚ÄìSchmidt theorem. In 1913, Schmidt married Vera Yanitskaia and graduated from the University of Kiev, where he worked as a privat-docent starting from 1916. After the October Revolution of 1917, he was a board member at several People's Commissariats (narkomats)such as Narkomprod from 1918 to 1920 (Narodnyi Komissariat Prodovolstviya, or People's Commissariat for Supplies), People's Commissariat for Finance from 1921 to 1922 (Narodnyi Komissariat Finansov, or People's Commissariat for Finances). Schmidt was one of the chief proponents of developing the higher education system, publishing, and science in Soviet Russia. He worked at Narkompros (People's Commissariat for Education), the State Scientific Board at the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, and the Communist Academy. He was Chair of the Foreign Literature Committee from October 1921.Lenin: 414. TO THE FOREIGN LITERATURE COMMITTEE Following the Litkens Commission Schmidt was also employed as the director of the State Publishing House (Gosizdat) from 1921 to 1924, and chief editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia from 1924 to 1941. From 1923 he was a professor at the Second Moscow State University and later at the Moscow State University, and from 1930 to 1932, Schmidt was the head of the Arctic Institute. From 1932‚Äì1939, he was appointed head of Glavsevmorput' (Glavnoe upravlenie Severnogo Morskogo Puti) ‚Äì an establishment that oversaw all commercial operations on the Northern Sea Route. From 1939 to 1942, Schmidt became a vice-president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he organized the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics (he was its director until 1949). Otto Schmidt was a founder of the Moscow Algebra School, which he directed for many years. In the mid-1940s, Schmidt suggested a new cosmogonical hypothesis on the formation of the Earth and other planets of the Solar system, which he continued to develop together with a group of Soviet scientists until his death. =Arctic= Schmidt was an explorer of the Arctic. In 1929 and 1930, he led expeditions on the steam icebreaker Georgy Sedov, establishing the first scientific research station on the Franz Josef Land, exploring the northwestern parts of the Kara Sea and western coasts of Severnaya Zemlya, and discovering a few islands. In 1932, Schmidt's expedition on the steam icebreaker Sibiryakov with Captain Vladimir Voronin made a non- stop voyage from Arkhangelsk to the Pacific Ocean without wintering for the first time in history. From 1933 to 1934, Schmidt led the voyage of the steamship Cheliuskin, also with Captain Vladimir Voronin, along the Northern Sea Route. In 1937, he supervised an airborne expedition that established a drift-ice station \\"North Pole-1\\". In 1938, he was in charge of evacuating its personnel from the ice. Otto Schmidt was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation (1938 -1946).

In cognitive psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory is a form of memory responsible for the recording of information about one's environment and spatial orientation. For example, a person's spatial memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's spatial memory is needed to learn the location of food at the end of a maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map. Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long- term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.  Short-term spatial memory  Short-term memory (STM) can be described as a system allowing one to temporarily store and manage information that is necessary to complete complex cognitive tasks. Tasks which employ short-term memory include learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Spatial memory is a cognitive process that enables a person to remember different locations as well as spatial relations between objects. This allows one to remember where an object is in relation to another object; for instance, allowing someone to navigate through a familiar city. Spatial memories are said to form after a person has already gathered and processed sensory information about her or his environment.  Spatial working memory  Working memory (WM) can be described as a limited capacity system that allows one to temporarily store and process information. This temporary store enables one to complete or work on complex tasks while being able to keep information in mind. For instance, the ability to work on a complicated mathematical problem utilizes one's working memory. One highly influential theory of WM is the Baddeley and Hitch multi-component model of working memory. The most recent version of this model suggests that there are four subcomponents to WM, namely the phonological loop; the visuo-spatial sketchpad; the central executive; and the episodic buffer. One component of this model, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, is said to be responsible for the temporary storage, maintenance, and manipulation of both visual and spatial information. Baddeley and Hitch's multi-component model of working memory. In contrast to the multi-component model, some researchers believe that STM should be viewed as a unitary construct. In this respect, visual, spatial, and verbal information are thought to be organized by levels of representation rather than the type of store to which they belong. Within the literature, it is suggested that further research into the fractionation of STM and WM be explored. However, much of the research into the visuo-spatial memory construct have been conducted in accordance to the paradigm advanced by Baddeley and Hitch. =The role of the central executive= Research into the exact function of the visuo-spatial sketchpad has indicated that both spatial short-term memory and working memory are dependent on executive resources and are not entirely distinct. For instance, performance on a working memory but not on a short-term memory task was affected by articulatory suppression suggesting that impairment on the spatial task was caused by the concurrent performance on a task that had extensive use of executive resources. Results have also found that performances were impaired on STM and WM tasks with executive suppression. This illustrates how, within the visuo-spatial domain, both STM and WM require similar utility of the central executive. Additionally, during a spatial visualisation task (which is related to executive functioning and not STM or WM) concurrent executive suppression impaired performance indicating that the effects were due to common demands on the central executive and not short-term storage. The researchers concluded with the explanation that the central executive employs cognitive strategies enabling participants to both encode and maintain mental representations during short-term memory tasks. Although studies suggest that the central executive is intimately involved in a number of spatial tasks, the exact way in which they are connected remains to be seen. Long-term spatial memory Spatial memory recall is built upon a hierarchical structure. That is to say that people remember the general layout of a particular space and then \\"cue target locations\\" within that spatial set. This paradigm includes an ordinal scale of features that an individual must attend to in order to inform his or her cognitive map. Recollection of spatial details is a top-down procedure that requires an individual to recall the superordinate features of a cognitive map, followed by the ordinate and subordinate features. Thus, two spatial features are prominent in navigating a path: general layout and landmark orienting (Kahana et al., 2006). People are not only capable of learning about the spatial layout of their surroundings, but they can also piece together novel routes and new spatial relations through inference. Yet, this field has traditionally been hampered by confounding variables, such as cost and the potential for previous exposure to an experimental environment. Thankfully, technological leaps have opened a new, albeit virtual, world to psychologists. A cognitive map is \\"a mental model of objects' spatial configuration that permits navigation along optimal path between arbitrary pairs of points.\\" This mental map is built upon two fundamental bedrocks: layout, also known as route knowledge, and landmark orientation. Layout is potentially the first method of navigation that people learn to utilize; its workings reflect our most basic understandings of the world. Hermer and Spelke (1994) determined that when toddlers begin to walk, around eighteen months, they navigate by their sense of the world's layout. Indeed, it would seem that a sojourning toddler's world is a place of axial lines and contrasting boundaries. McNamara, Hardy and Hirtle identified region membership as a major building block of anyone's cognitive map (1989). Specifically, region membership is defined by any kind of boundary, whether physical, perceptual or subjective (McNamara et al., 1989). Boundaries are among the most basic and endemic qualities in the world around us. These boundaries are nothing more than axial lines which are a feature that people are biased towards when relating to space; for example one axial line determinant is gravity (McNamara & Shelton, 2001; Kim & Penn, 2004). Axial lines aid everyone in apportioning our perceptions into regions. This parceled world idea is further supported items by the finding that items that get recalled together are more likely than not to also be clustered within the same region of one's larger cognitive map. Clustering shows that people tend to chunk information together according to smaller layouts within a larger cognitive map. Boundaries, though, are not the only determinants of layout. Clustering also demonstrates another important property of our relation to spatial conceptions. This is that spatial recall is a hierarchical process. When someone recalls an environment or navigates terrain, that person implicitly recalls the overall layout at first. Then, due to the concept's \\"rich correlational structure\\", a series of associations become activated. Eventually the resulting cascade of activations will awaken the particular details that correspond with the region being recalled. This is how people encode many entities from varying ontological levels, such as the location of a stapler; in a desk; which is in the office .. Alas, layout has its flaws too. One can recall from only one at region at a time (a bottleneck). A bottleneck in a person's cognitive navigational system could be disastrous, for instance if there were need for a sudden detour on a long road trip. And yet, people are still capable of getting place to place functionally. Lack of experience in a locale, or simply sheer size, can disorient one's mental layout, especially in a large and unfamiliar place with many overwhelming stimuli. In these environments people are still able to orient themselves, and even find their way around using landmarks. This ability to \\"prioritize objects and regions in complex scenes for selection (and) recognition\\" was labeled by Chun and Jiang in 1998. Landmarks give people guidance by activating \\"learned associations between the global context and target locations.\\" Mallot and Gillner (2000) showed that subjects learned an association between a specific landmark and the direction of a turn, thereby furthering the relationship between associations and landmarks. Shelton and McNamara (2001) succinctly summed up why landmarks, as markers, are so helpful: \\"location...cannot be described without making reference to the orientation of the observer.\\" It is fairly clear that people use both the layout of a particular space, as well as the presence of orienting landmarks in order to navigate. Yet, psychologists have yet to explain whether layout affects landmarks or if landmarks determine the boundaries of a layout. Thus, this concept suffers from a chicken and the egg paradox. In fact, McNamara has found that subjects use \\"clusters of landmarks as intrinsic frames of reference,\\" which only confuses the issue further. People perceive objects in their environment relative to other objects in that same environment. In other words, landmarks and layout are complementary systems for spatial recall. However, it is unknown how these two systems interact when both types of information are available. Thus, we have to make certain assumptions about the interaction between these two systems. For example, cognitive maps are not \\"absolute\\" but rather, as anyone can attest, are \\"used to provide a default...(which) modulated according to...task demands.\\" Psychologists also think that cognitive maps are instance based, which accounts for \\"discriminative matching to past experience.\\" These assumptions could soon be validated. Advances in virtual reality technology have pried open the door to this enigmatic field. Now experimenters find themselves creating scenarios that were impossible to imagine fifteen years ago. Virtual reality affords experimenters the luxury of extreme control over their test environment. Any variable can be manipulated, including things that would not be possible in reality. Virtual reality During one recent study researchers designed three different virtual towns, each of which had its own \\"unique road layout and a unique set of five stores.\\" However, the overall footprint of the different maps was exactly the same size, \\"80 sq. units.\\" In this experiment, participants had to partake in two different sets of trials. First, participants were assigned two of the three virtual landscapes and tasked with the role of a taxi driver. The participant's avatar picked up a total of 25 passengers and dropped them off at random locations throughout the map. Researchers measured the participants' \\"delivery path length\\" in both sets of the first trial. They found that there was a \\"clear decrease in path length with increased number of deliveries in a town.\\" The participants' improved route length correlated with the increasing amount of experience they got driving in the virtual towns. However, as one would expect, the knowledge that participants gleaned from the first town did not transfer, or aid them, in their travels around the second town. Thus, Newman et al. (2006) inferred that the participants \\"formed a survey representation of each town.\\" That is they drove around enough of the town to infer the general layout of the rest of it. The second set of trials involved the same task for the participants but with some changes to the context of the environment. Researchers added two more maps and made them smaller. The second map set in this trial was standardized with the same layout and landmarks, meaning that all participants would experience this map on their second run. Moreover, three of the five maps \\"replaced some set of the landmarks with novel landmarks while the layout of target locations remain(ed) unchanged.\\" The other two maps were either \\"identical\\" to the second traversed landscape of the second trial or both the landmarks and their relative locations were changed. Again, Newman et al. measured \\"excess path length,\\" specifically focusing on the excess distance traveled on the first delivery of the second map in the second trial, where they believed that spatial learning would transfer mostly strongly from the first map. They found that the group that encountered altered building representations in the same locations had the highest level of layout knowledge transfer from the first town. The results of the first trial showed that people are capable of learning the spatial layout of an interactive environment. The second trial showed that despite a change in landmark presence, participants were still able to \\"find novel shortest routes.\\" Because participants did not travel across previously memorized routes and still performed well according to the \\"excess path length\\" standard, Newman et al. concluded that these results evidenced \\"some higher-order survey representation of the environment.\\" A study conducted at the University of Maryland compared the effect of different levels of immersion on spatial memory recall. In the study, 40 participants used both a traditional desktop and a head-mounted display to view two environments, a medieval town, and an ornate palace, where they memorized two sets of 21 faces presented as 3D portraits. After viewing these 21 faces for 5 minutes, followed by a brief rest period, the faces in the virtual environments were replaced with numbers and participants recalled which face was at each location. The study found on average, those who used the head-mounted display recalled the faces 8.8% more accurately, and with a greater confidence. The participants state that leveraging their innate vestibular and proprioceptive senses with the head- mounted display and mapping aspects of the environment relative to their body, elements that are absent with the desktop, was key to their success. =Spatial expertise= Within the literature there is evidence that experts in a particular field are able to perform memory tasks in accordance with their skills at an exceptional level. The level of skill displayed by experts has also been said to exceed the limits of the normal capacity of both STM and WM. It is believed that because experts have an enormous amount of prelearned and task-specific knowledge, they are able to encode information in a more efficient way. An interesting study investigating taxi drivers' memory for streets in Helsinki, Finland, examined the role of prelearned spatial knowledge. This study compared experts to a control group to determine how this prelearned knowledge in their skill domain allows them to overcome the capacity limitations of STM and WM. The study used four levels of spatial randomness: * Route Order ‚Äì spatially continuous route * Route Random ‚Äì spatially continuous list presented randomly * Map Order ‚Äì street names forming a straight line on the map, but omitting intermediate streets * Map Random ‚Äì streets on map presented in random order The famous yellow taxi cabs of New York city. The results of this study indicate that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM. =Animal research= Within the literature it has been found that certain species of paridae and corvidae (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory to remember where, when and what type of food they have cached. Recent studies with rats and squirrels, have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers to control for a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odour cues that could skew results of memory research. In particular, studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behaviour, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden. Thus, the evidence for the spatial memory of some species of animals, such as rats, indicates that they do use spatial memory to locate and retrieve hidden food stores. During a study using GPS tracking to see where domestic cats go when their owners let them outside, has shown that cats have excellent spatial memory. Some of the cats in the study demonstrated exceptional long term spatial memory. One of such cats, that usually travelled no further than to from its home, had unexpectedly travelled some from its home. Researchers initially thought this to be a GPS malfunction, but soon discovered that the cat's owners went out of town that weekend, and that the house the cat went to was the owner's old house. The owners and the cat hadn't lived in that house for well over a year. Visual‚Äìspatial distinction Logie (1995) proposed that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is broken down into two subcomponents, one visual and one spatial. These are the visual cache and the inner scribe, respectively. The visual cache is a temporary visual store including such dimensions as colour and shape. Conversely, the inner scribe is a rehearsal mechanism for visual information and is responsible for information concerning movement sequences. Although a general lack of consensus regarding this distinction has been noted in the literature, there is a growing amount of evidence that the two components are separate and serve different functions. Visual memory is responsible for retaining visual shapes and colours (i.e., what), whereas spatial memory is responsible for information about locations and movement (i.e., where). This distinction is not always straightforward since part of visual memory involves spatial information and vice versa. For example, memory for object shapes usually involves maintaining information about the spatial arrangement of the features which define the object in question. In practice the two systems work together in some capacity but different tasks have been developed to highlight the unique abilities involved in either visual or spatial memory. For example, the visual patterns test (VPT) measures visual span whereas the Corsi Blocks Task measures spatial span. Correlational studies of the two measures suggest a separation between visual and spatial abilities, due to a lack of correlation found between them in both healthy and brain damaged patients. Support for the division of visual and spatial memory components is found through experiments using the dual-task paradigm. A number of studies have shown that the retention of visual shapes or colours (i.e., visual information) is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures or dynamic visual noise. Conversely, the retention of location (i.e., spatial information) is disrupted only by spatial tracking tasks, spatial tapping tasks, and eye movements. For example, participants completed both the VPT and the Corsi Blocks Task in a selective interference experiment. During the retention interval of the VPT, the subject viewed irrelevant pictures (e.g., avant-garde paintings). The spatial interference task required participants to follow, by touching the stimuli, an arrangement of small wooden pegs which were concealed behind a screen. Both the visual and spatial spans were shortened by their respective interference tasks, confirming that the Corsi Blocks Task relates primarily to spatial working memory. Measurement There are a variety of tasks that psychologists use to measure spatial memory on adults, children and animal models. These tasks allow professionals to identify cognitive irregularities in adults and children and allows researchers to administer varying types of drugs and or lesions in participants and measure the consequential effects on spatial memory. =The Corsi block tapping task= Also known as the Corsi Span Test, this psychological test is commonly used to determine the visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm baseboard in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters' side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The sequence length increases each trial until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall. The test was created by Canadian neuropsychologist Phillip Corsi, who modeled it after Hebb's digit span task by replacing the numerical test items with spatial ones. On average, most participants achieve a span of five items on the Corsi span test and seven on the digit span task. =Visual pattern span= This is similar to the Corsi block tapping test but regarded as a more pure test of visual short-term recall.Della Sala, S., Gray, C., Baddeley, A., & Wilson, L. (1997). The Visual Patterns Test: A new test of short-term visual recall. Feltham, Suffolk: Thames Valley Test Company. Participants are presented with a series of matrix patterns that have half their cells coloured and the other half blank. The matrix patterns are arranged in a way that is difficult to code verbally, forcing the participant to rely on visual spatial memory. Beginning with a small 2 x 2 matrix, participants copy the matrix pattern from memory into an empty matrix. The matrix patterns are increased in size and complexity at a rate of two cells until the participant's ability to replicate them breaks down. On average, participants' performance tends to break down at sixteen cells. =Pathway span task= This task is designed to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with a little man. Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant's little man on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is asked to indicate on a real matrix where the little man that he or she visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1-10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6. =Dynamic mazes= These are intended for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze with a picture of a man in the centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze to the drawing of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze to the drawing of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases. =Radial arm maze= Simple Radial Maze First pioneered by Olton and Samuelson in 1976, the radial arm maze is designed to test the spatial memory capabilities of rats. Mazes are typically designed with a centre platform and a varying number of arms branching off with food placed at the ends. The arms are usually shielded from each other in some way but not to the extent that external cues cannot be used as reference points. In most cases, the rat is placed in the center of the maze and needs to explore each arm individually to retrieve food while simultaneously remembering which arms it has already pursued. The maze is set up so the rat is forced to return to the center of the maze before pursuing another arm. Measures are usually taken to prevent the rat from using its olfactory senses to navigate such as placing extra food throughout the bottom of the maze. =Morris water navigation task= The Morris water navigation task is a classic test for studying spatial learning and memory in rats and was first developed in 1981 by Richard G. Morris for whom the test is named. The subject is placed in a round tank of translucent water with walls that are too high for it to climb out and water that is too deep for it to stand in. Additionally, the walls of the tank are decorated with visual cues to serve as reference points. The rat must swim around the pool until by chance it discovers just below the surface the hidden platform onto which it can climb. Typically, rats swim around the edge of the pool first before venturing out into the center in a meandering pattern before stumbling upon the hidden platform. However, as time spent in the pool increases experience, the amount of time needed to locate the platform decreases, with veteran rats swimming directly to the platform almost immediately after being placed in the water. Physiology =Hippocampus= Hippocampus shown in red The hippocampus provides animals with a spatial map of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means in reference to one's body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term spatial memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has the important role of processing information about spatial locations. Blocking plasticity in this region results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember spatial layouts and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in spatial navigation. Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display spatial deficits by not reacting to spatial change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally ungraded (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, but not when it is partially lesioned. Deficits in spatial memory are also found in spatial discrimination tasks. Brain slice showing areas CA1 and CA3 in the hippocampus Large differences in spatial impairment are found among the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Lesions to the ventral hippocampus have no effect on spatial memory, while the dorsal hippocampus is required for retrieval, processing short-term memory and transferring memory from the short term to longer delay periods. Infusion of amphetamine into the dorsal hippocampus has also been shown to enhance memory for spatial locations learned previously. These findings indicate that there is a functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Hemispheric differences within the hippocampus are also observed. A study on London taxi drivers, asked drivers to recall complex routes around the city as well as famous landmarks for which the drivers had no knowledge of their spatial location. This resulted in an activation of the right hippocampus solely during recall of the complex routes which indicates that the right hippocampus is used for navigation in large scale spatial environments. The hippocampus is known to contain two separate memory circuits. One circuit is used for recollection-based place recognition memory and includes the entorhinal-CA1 system, while the other system, consisting of the hippocampus trisynaptic loop (entohinal-dentate-CA3-CA1) is used for place recall memory and facilitation of plasticity at the entorhinal-dentate synapse in mice is sufficient to enhance place recall. Place cells are also found in the hippocampus. =Posterior parietal cortex= Parietal lobe shown in red The parietal cortex encodes spatial information using an egocentric frame of reference. It is therefore involved in the transformation of sensory information coordinates into action or effector coordinates by updating the spatial representation of the body within the environment. As a result, lesions to the parietal cortex produce deficits in the acquisition and retention of egocentric tasks, whereas minor impairment is seen among allocentric tasks. Rats with lesions to the anterior region of the posterior parietal cortex reexplore displaced objects, while rats with lesions to the posterior region of the posterior parietal cortex displayed no reaction to spatial change. Parietal cortex lesions are also known to produce temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia. =Entorhinal cortex= Medial view of the right cerebral hemisphere showing the entorhinal cortex in red at the base of the temporal lobe The dorsalcaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a topographically organized map of the spatial environment made up of grid cells. This brain region thus transforms sensory input from the environment and stores it as a durable allocentric representation in the brain to be used for path integration. The entorhinal cortex contributes to the processing and integration of geometric properties and information in the environment. Lesions to this region impair the use of distal but not proximal landmarks during navigation and produces a delay- dependent deficit in spatial memory that is proportional to the length of the delay. Lesions to this region are also known to create retention deficits for tasks learned up to 4 weeks but not 6 weeks prior to the lesions. Memory consolidation in the entorhinal cortex is achieved through extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. =Prefrontal cortex= Medial view of the cerebral hemisphere showing the location of the prefrontal cortex and more specifically the medial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in purple The medial prefrontal cortex processes egocentric spatial information. It participates in the processing of short-term spatial memory used to guide planned search behavior and is believed to join spatial information with its motivational significance. The identification of neurons that anticipate expected rewards in a spatial task support this hypothesis. The medial prefrontal cortex is also implicated in the temporal organization of information. Hemisphere specialization is found in this brain region. The left prefrontal cortex preferentially processes categorical spatial memory including source memory (reference to spatial relationships between a place or event), while the right prefrontal cortex preferentially processes coordinate spatial memory including item memory (reference to spatial relationships between features of an item). Lesions to the medial prefrontal cortex impair the performance of rats on a previously trained radial arm maze, however, rats can gradually improve to the level of the controls as a function of experience. Lesions to this area also cause deficits on delayed nonmatching- to-positions tasks and impairments in the acquisition of spatial memory tasks during training trials. =Retrosplenial cortex= The retrosplenial cortex is involved in the processing of allocentric memory and geometric properties in the environment. Inactivation of this region accounts for impaired navigation in the dark and thus it is implicated to be involved in the process of path integration. Lesions to the retrosplenial cortex consistently impair tests of allocentric memory, while sparing egocentric memory. Animals with lesions to the caudal retrosplenial cortex show impaired performance on a radial arm maze only when the maze is rotated to remove their reliance on intramaze cues. Medial view of the cerebral hemisphere. The retrosplenial cortex encompasses Brodmann areas 26, 29, and 30. The perirhinal cortex contains Brodmann area 35 and 36 (not shown) In humans, damage to the retrosplenial cortex results in topographical disorientation. Most cases involve damage to the right retrosplenial cortex and include Brodmann area 30. Patients are often impaired at learning new routes and at navigating through familiar environments. However, most patients usually recover within 8 weeks. The retrosplenial cortex preferentially processes spatial information in the right hemisphere. =Perirhinal cortex= The perirhinal cortex is associated with both spatial reference and spatial working memory. It processes relational information of environmental cues and locations. Lesions in the perirhinal cortex account for deficits in reference memory and working memory, and increase the rate of forgetting of information during training trials of the Morris water maze. This accounts for the impairment in the initial acquisition of the task. Lesions also cause impairment on an object location task and reduce habituation to a novel environment. Neuroplasticity Spatial memories are formed after an animal gathers and processes sensory information about its surroundings (especially vision and proprioception). In general, mammals require a functioning hippocampus (particularly area CA1) in order to form and process memories about space. There is some evidence that human spatial memory is strongly tied to the right hemisphere of the brain. Spatial learning requires both NMDA and AMPA receptors, consolidation requires NMDA receptors, and the retrieval of spatial memories requires AMPA receptors. In rodents, spatial memory has been shown to covary with the size of a part of the hippocampal mossy fiber projection. The function of NMDA receptors varies according to the subregion of the hippocampus. NMDA receptors are required in the CA3 of the hippocampus when spatial information needs to be reorganized, while NMDA receptors in the CA1 are required in the acquisition and retrieval of memory after a delay, as well as in the formation of CA1 place fields. Blockade of the NMDA receptors prevents induction of long-term potentiation and impairs spatial learning. The CA3 of the hippocampus plays an especially important role in the encoding and retrieval of spatial memories. The CA3 is innervated by two afferent paths known as the perforant path (PPCA3) and the dentate gyrus (DG)-mediated mossy fibers (MFs). The first path is regarded as the retrieval index path while the second is concerned with encoding. Disorders/deficits =Topographical disorientation= Topographical disorientation is a cognitive disorder that results in the individual being unable to orient his or herself in the real or virtual environment. Patients also struggle with spatial information dependant tasks. These problems could possibly be the result of a disruption in the ability to access one's cognitive map, a mental representation of the surrounding environment or the inability to judge objects' location in relation to one's self.Stark, M; Coslett, HB; Saffran, EM (1996). Impairment of an egocentric map of locations: implications for perception and action. 13. Cogn Neuropsychol. pp. 481‚Äì523. Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD) is diagnosed when patients have shown an inability to navigate even familiar surroundings since birth and show no apparent neurological causes for this deficiency such as lesioning or brain damage. DTD is a relatively new disorder and can occur in varying degrees of severity. Topographical Disorientation in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study was done to see if Topographical Disorientation had an effect on individuals who had mild cognitive impairment. The study was done by recruiting forty-one patients diagnosed with MCI and 24 healthy control individuals. The standards that were set for this experiment were: # Subjective cognitive complaint by the patient or his/her caregiver. # Normal general cognitive function above the 16th percentile on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). # Normal activities of daily living (ADL) assessed both clinically and on a standardized scale (as described below). # Objective cognitive decline below the 16th percentile on neuropsychological tests. # Exclusion of dementia. (TD) was assessed clinically in all participants. Neurological and neuropsychological evaluations were determined by a magnetic imaging scan which was performed on each participant. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare patterns of gray-matter atrophy between patients with and without TD, and a group of normal controls. The outcome of the experiment was that they found TD in 17 out of the 41 MCI patients (41.4%). The functional abilities were significantly impaired in MCI patients with TD compared to in MCI patients without TD and that the presence of TD in MCI patients is associated with loss of gray matter in the medial temporal regions, including the hippocampus.Tae- Sung Lim, Giuseppe Iaria, So Young Moon. \\"Topographical Disorientation in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study.\\" 9 August 2010. 16 April 2011 . =Hippocampal damage and schizophrenia= Research with rats indicates that spatial memory may be adversely affected by neonatal damage to the hippocampus in a way that closely resembles schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is thought to stem from neurodevelopmental problems shortly after birth. Rats are commonly used as models of schizophrenia patients. Experimenters create lesions in the ventral hippocampal area shortly after birth, a procedure known as neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioning(NVHL). Adult rats who with NVHL show typical indicators of schizophrenia such as hypersensitivity to psychostimulants, reduced social interactions and impaired prepulse inhibition, working memory and set-shifting. Similar to schizophrenia, impaired rats fail to use environmental context in spatial learning tasks such as showing difficulty completing the radial arm maze and the Moris water maze.Winocur, G. & Mills, J. A. (1970). Transfer between related and unrelated problems following hippocampal lesions in rats. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology =GPS= Example of a hand held GPS Recent research on spatial memory and wayfinding in an article by Ishikawa et al. in 2008 revealed that using a GPS moving map device reduces an individual's navigation abilities when compared to other participants who were using maps or had previous experience on the route with a guide. GPS moving map devices are frequently set up to allow the user to only see a small detailed close-up of a particular segment of the map which is constantly updated. In comparison, maps usually allow the user to see the same view of the entire route from departure to arrival. Other research has shown that individuals who use GPS travel more slowly overall compared to map users who are faster. GPS users stop more frequently and for a longer period of time whereas map users and individuals using past experience as a guide travel on more direct routes to reach their goal. =NEIL1= Endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1) is a DNA repair enzyme that is widely expressed throughout the brain. NEIL1 is a DNA glycosylase that initiates the first step in base excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and then introducing a DNA strand break via an associated lyase reaction. This enzyme recognizes and removes oxidized DNA bases including formamidopyrimidine, thymine glycol, 5-hydroxyuracil and 5-hydroxycytosine. NEIL1 promotes short-term spatial memory retention. Mice lacking NEIL1 have impaired short-term spatial memory retention in a water maze test. Learning difficulties Nonverbal learning disability is characterized by normal verbal abilities but impaired visuospatial abilities. Problem areas for children with nonverbal learning disability are arithmetic, geometry, and science. Impairments in spatial memory is implicated in nonverbal learning disorder and other learning difficulties. Arithmetic word problems involve written text containing a set of data followed by one or more questions and require the use of the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Researchers suggest that successful completion of arithmetic word problems involves spatial working memory (involved in building schematic representations) which facilitates the creation of spatial relationships between objects. Creating spatial relationships between objects is an important part of solving word problems because mental operations and transformations are required. For example, consider the following question: \\"A child builds three towers using red and white coloured blocks of the same size. The lowest tower has 14 blocks; the highest has 7 more blocks. The intermediate tower has three blocks less than the highest one. How many blocks are in each of the three towers?\\" To solve the question, it is necessary to maintain incoming information (i.e., the text) and integrate it with previous information (such as knowledge for arithmetic operations). The individual must also select relevant (i.e., the spatial relationship between the blocks) and inhibit irrelevant information (i.e., the colours and textures of the blocks) and simultaneously build a mental representation of the problem. Researchers investigated the role of spatial memory and visual memory in the ability to complete arithmetic word problems. Children in the study completed the Corsi Block Task (forward and backward series) and a spatial matrix task, as well as a visual memory task called the house recognition test. Poor problem-solvers were impaired on the Corsi Block Tasks and the spatial matrix task, but performed normally on the house recognition test when compared to normally achieving children. The experiment demonstrated that poor problem solving is related specifically to deficient processing of spatial information. Sleep Sleep has been found to benefit spatial memory, by enhancing hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation. Hippocampal areas activated in route-learning are reactivated during subsequent sleep (NREM sleep in particular). It was demonstrated in a particular study that the actual extent of reactivation during sleep correlated with the improvement in route retrieval and thus memory performance the following day. Thus, the study established the idea that sleep enhances the systems-level process of consolidation that consequently enhances/improves behavioural performance. Furthermore, a period of wakefulness has no effect on stabilizing memory traces, in comparison to a period of sleep. Sleep after the first post-training night, i.e. on the second night, does not benefit spatial memory consolidation further. Therefore, sleeping in the first post-training night e.g. after learning a route, is most important. Sleep deprivation and sleep has also been a researched association. Sleep deprivation actually hinders memory performance improvement due to an active disruption of spatial memory consolidation. Therefore, spatial memory is enhanced by a period of sleep.

These inventions included various ray generators, firepaste (an ablative heatproofing material), the Ursus personal armor suit and the Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armor. Personal life Born in Hamilton, Ontario, he moved to North Bay and later died in a 2018 vehicle accident west of there. Inventions =Ursus suit= Hurtubise built a metal suit for protection from grizzly bears; recorded as a National Film Board of Canada documentary and called Project Grizzly, in which Hurtubise tested the capabilities of the suit using himself as the test subject. This resulted in his Ig Nobel Prize for Safety Engineering in 1998.Improbable Research The documentary focuses on version six of the suit (\\"Ursa Mark VI\\"), and also includes clips of the previous versions being tested. = Firepaste = Firepaste [see, also, Starlite] is an intumescent white paste that, when dry, is flame and heat resistant. It has a consistency and texture similar to clay when wet and dries into a gray ceramic material which resembles concrete. The impetus for firepaste came from a failed fire test with the Ursus Mark VII where the metal exoskeleton heated up, popped the air bags and left Hurtubise with numerous burns. Like Project Grizzly, Hurtubise has tested the material on himself. For a demonstration for the media and military in summer 2004, he made a thin mask of the material, put it over his face, and aimed a specialized blowtorch at thousands of degrees directly at the mask. The temperature was intentionally much hotter than the temperatures reached by the Space Shuttle on reentry. A thermometer located between his face and the mask measured no appreciable temperature change below the mask after nearly ten minutes, and the integrity of the material was not compromised.Improbable Research = Angel Light = According to Hurtubise, this device made walls, hands, stealth shielding, and other objects transparent. He claimed that beams from the device had the side- effects of damaging electronic devices and killing goldfish. After testing the device on his own hand, he claimed he could see his own blood vessels and muscle tissue as clearly as if the skin had been pulled back, but the beam caused numbness and he began to feel ill. He also claimed to be able to read the licence plate on a car in his garage from his workshop and see the road salt on it. There are no pictures or any sort of objective, verifiable evidence to support these claims made by Hurtubise.https://gizmodo.com/030657/angel-light-allows-crazy-people-to-see- through-walls = Trojan armor = In early 2007, Hurtubise made public his new protective suit which was designed to be worn by soldiers. Calling it the \\"Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armor\\", Hurtubise described it as the \\"first ballistic, full exoskeleton body suit of armour\\". He claimed that the suit could withstand bullets fired from high powered weapons (including an elephant gun). Hurtubise published a demonstration video in which 9mm, .357 handgun rounds, and a 12 gauge shotgun round were fired at the suit's vest from short range; the apparently uncut video shows no marks at all on the ballistic clay underneath.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-uAqgd6Oc The suit also features a knife holster and a helmet with two fans, one for intake and one for exhaust, to help cool the wearer. The suit has many features including a solar powered air system, recording device, compartments for emergency morphine and salt, and a knife and gun holster. He estimates that the cost of each suit to be roughly $2,000 if mass-produced. It has been called the \\"Halo suit\\", after the fictional MJOLNIR battle armor worn by the Master Chief character in the Xbox and PC video game series Halo. In early February 2010, after failing to receive any offers to buy the Trojan, Hurtubise, now bankrupt from the expense of creating the suit, was forced to put the prototype up for auction on eBay in the hopes that it would bring in enough money to sustain his family. The auction's reserve bid was not met. There was a raffle for the suit on the Mission Trojan website, whose goal is to raise money for further prototypes and testing of the Trojan Suit to demonstrate its abilities for military applications.at Missiontrojan.com (currently down) The suit was won by Sara Markis of Florida who donated it back to Hurtubise for work on his next prototype.

It is located east of the Tabqa Dam, Syria's largest dam. The Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine city and bishopric Callinicum (formerly a Latin and now a Maronite Catholic titular see) was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate between 796 and 809, under the reign of Harun al-Rashid. It was also the capital of the Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. With a population of 220,488 based on the 2004 official census, Raqqa is the sixth largest city in Syria. During the Syrian Civil War, the city was captured in 2013 by the Syrian opposition and then by the Islamic State. ISIL made the city its capital in 2014. As a result, the city was hit by airstrikes from the Syrian government, Russia, the United States, and several other countries. Most non-Sunni religious structures in the city were destroyed by ISIL, most notably the Shia Uwais al- Qarni Mosque, while others were converted into Sunni mosques. On 17 October 2017, following a lengthy battle that saw massive destruction to the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared the liberation of Raqqa from the Islamic State to be complete.  History  =Hellenistic and Byzantine Kallinikos= The area of Raqqa has been inhabited since remote antiquity, as attested by the mounds (tells) of Tall Zaydan and Tall al-Bi'a, the latter being identified with the Babylonian city Tuttul. The modern city traces its history to the Hellenistic period, with the foundation of the city of Nikephorion (, Latinized as Nicephorion or Nicephorium) by Seleucid King Seleucus I Nicator (reigned 301‚Äì281 BC). His successor, Seleucus II Callinicus (r. 246‚Äì225 BC), enlarged the city and renamed it after himself as Kallinikos (, Latinized as Callinicum). Isidore of Charax, in the Parthian Stations, writes that it was a Greek city, founded by Alexander the Great.Isidoros of Charax, Parthian Stations, ¬ß 1.2 In Roman times, it was part of the Roman province of Osrhoene but had declined by the fourth century. Rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Leo I (r. 457‚Äì474 AD) in 466, it was named Leontopolis (in Greek ŒõŒµŒøŒΩœÑœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ or \\"city of Leon\\") after him, but the name Kallinikos prevailed. The city played an important role in the Byzantine Empire's relations with Sassanid Persia and the wars fought between the two empires. By treaty, the city was recognized as one of the few official cross-border trading posts between the two empires, along with Nisibis and Artaxata. The town was near the site of a battle in 531 between Romans and Sasanians, when the latter tried to invade the Roman territories, surprisingly via arid regions in Syria, to turn the tide of the Iberian War. The Persians won the battle, but the casualties on both sides were high. In 542, the city was destroyed by the Persian Emperor Khusrau I (r. 531‚Äì579), who razed its fortifications and deported its population to Persia, but it was subsequently rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). In 580, during another war with Persia, the future Emperor Maurice scored a victory over the Persians near the city during his retreat from an abortive expedition to capture Ctesiphon. = Early Islamic period = The remains of the historic Baghdad gate In the year 639 or 640, the city fell to the Muslim conqueror Iyad ibn Ghanm. Since then, it has figured in Arabic sources as al-Raqqah. At the surrender of the city, the Christian inhabitants concluded a treaty with Ibn Ghanm that is quoted by al-Baladhuri. The treaty allowed them freedom of worship in their existing churches but forbade the construction of new ones. The city retained an active Christian community well into the Middle Ages (Michael the Syrian records 20 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) bishops from the 8th to the 12th centuriesRevue de l'Orient chr√©tien , VI (1901), p. 197.), and it had at least four monasteries, of which the Saint Zaccheus Monastery remained the most prominent one. The city's Jewish community also survived until at least the 12th century, when the traveller Benjamin of Tudela visited it and attended its synagogue. Ibn Ghanm's successor as governor of Raqqa and the Jazira, Sa'id ibn Amir ibn Hidhyam, built the city's first mosque. The building was later enlarged to monumental proportions, measuring some , with a square brick minaret added later, possibly in the mid-10th century. The mosque survived until the early 20th century, being described by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld in 1907, but has since vanished. Many companions of Muhammad lived in Raqqa. In 656, during the First Fitna, the Battle of Siffin, the decisive clash between Ali and the Umayyad Mu'awiya took place about west of Raqqa. The tombs of several of Ali's followers (such as Ammar ibn Yasir and Uwais al-Qarani) are in Raqqa and have become sites of pilgrimage. The city also contained a column with Ali's autograph, but it was removed in the 12th century and taken to Aleppo's Ghawth Mosque. The strategic importance of Raqqa grew during the wars at the end of the Umayyad Caliphate and the beginning of the Abbasid Caliphate. Raqqa lay on the crossroads between Syria and Iraq and the road between Damascus, Palmyra and the temporary seat of the caliphate Resafa, al-Ruha'. Between 771 and 772, the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur built a garrison city about to the west of Raqqa for a detachment of his Khorasanian Persian army. It was named al-RƒÅfiqah, \\"the companion\\", whose city wall is still visible. Raqqa and al-RƒÅfiqah merged into one urban complex, together larger than the former Umayyad capital, Damascus. In 796, the caliph Harun al-Rashid chose Raqqa/al-Rafiqah as his imperial residence. For about 13 years, Raqqa was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, which stretched from Northern Africa to Central Asia, but the main administrative body remained in Baghdad. The palace area of Raqqa covered an area of about north of the twin cities. One of the founding fathers of the Hanafi school of law, Mu·∏•ammad ash-ShaibƒÅnƒ´, was chief qadi (judge) in Raqqa. The splendour of the court in Raqqa is documented in several poems, collected by Abu al-Faraj al-IsfahƒÅni in his \\"Book of Songs\\" (KitƒÅb al-AghƒÅni). Only the small, restored so-called Eastern Palace at the fringes of the palace district gives an impression of Abbasid architecture. Some of the palace complexes dating to the period have been excavated by a German team on behalf of the Director General of Antiquities. There was also a thriving industrial complex located between the twin cities. Both German and English teams have excavated parts of the industrial complex, revealing comprehensive evidence for pottery and glass production. Apart from large dumps of debris, the evidence consisted of pottery and glass workshops, containing the remains of pottery kilns and glass furnaces. Approximately west of Raqqa lay the unfinished victory monument Heraqla from the time of Harun al-Rashid. It is said to commemorate the conquest of the Byzantine city of Herakleia in Asia Minor in 806. Other theories connect it with cosmological events. The monument is preserved in a substructure of a square building in the centre of a circular walled enclosure, in diameter. However, the upper part was never finished because of the sudden death of Harun al-Rashid in Greater Khorasan. After the return of the court to Baghdad in 809, Raqqa remained the capital of the western part of the Abassid Caliphate. =Decline and period of Bedouin domination= Raqqa's fortunes declined in the late 9th century because of continuous warfare between the Abbasids and the Tulunids, and then with the Shia movement of the Qarmatians. Under the HamdƒÅnids in the 940s, the city declined rapidly. From the late 10th century to the early 12th century, Raqqa was controlled by Bedouin dynasties. The Banu Numayr had their pasture in the DiyƒÅr Mu·∏çar, and the Banu Uqay had their centre in Qal'at Ja'bar. =Second blossoming= Raqqa experienced a second blossoming, based on agriculture and industrial production, during the Zangid and Ayyubid dynasties during the 12th and the first half of the 13th century. The blue-glazed Raqqa ware dates from this time. The still-visible BƒÅb BaghdƒÅd (Baghdad Gate) and the Qasr al-BanƒÅt (Castle of the Ladies) are notable buildings of the period. The famous ruler 'ImƒÅd ad-Dƒ´n Zangƒ´, who was killed in 1146, was initially buried in Raqqa, which was destroyed during the 1260s Mongol invasions of the Levant. There is a report on the killing of the last inhabitants of the ruins of the city in 1288. =Ottoman period= In the 16th century, Raqqa again entered the historical record as an Ottoman customs post on the Euphrates. The eyalet (province) of Raqqa was created. However, the capital of the eyalet and seat of the WƒÅli was not Raqqa but Al-Ruha', which is about north of Raqqa. From the 1820s, Raqqa was a place of wintering for the semi-nomadic Arab 'Afadla tribal confederation and was little more than its extensive archeological remains. It was the establishment in 1864 by the Ottomans of the Karakul Janissary garrison, in the south-east corner of the Abbasid enclosure, that led to the revival of the modern city of Raqqa. Over the following decades, the province became the centre of the Ottoman Empire's tribal settlement (isk√¢n) policy.Stefan Winter, \\"The Province of Raqqa under Ottoman Rule, 1535‚Äì1800\\" in Journal of Near Eastern Studies 68 (2009), 253‚Äì67. The first families that settled in Raqqa were nicknamed The Ghul by the surrounding Arab semi-nomadic tribes from whom they bought the right to settle within the Abbasid enclosure, near the Janissary garrison. They used the ancient bricks of the enclosure to build the first buildings of modern Raqqa. They came under the protection of the surrounding Arab semi-nomadic tribes because they feared attacks from other neighboring tribes on their herds. As a result, these families formed two alliances. One joined Kurds of the M√Ælan tribe, Arabs of the Dulaim tribe, and possibly Turks as well. Most of the Kurdish families came from an area called Nahid Al-Jilab, which is northeast of ≈ûanliurfa. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, there were many families in Raqqa that still belonged to the M√Ælan tribe such as Khalaf Al-Qasim, Al-Jado, Al-Hani and Al- Shawakh. They claimed the area west of the Ottoman garrison. The M√Ælan tribe had been in Raqqa since 1711. The Ottomans issued an order to deport them from the Nahid Al-Jilab region to the Raqqa area. However most of the tribe was returned to their original home as a result of diseases among their cattle and frequent deaths due to the Raqqa climate. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans recognised the Kurdish tribal chiefs and appointed Mahmud Kalash Abdi as head of the isk√¢n policy in the region. The tribal chiefs had the power to impose taxes and control over other tribes in the region. Some of the Kurdish families were displaced to the northern countryside of Raqqa by the Arab 'Annazah tribe, after they began working with the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. The other alliance, Asharin, came from the town of Al-Asharah downstream. It included several Arab tribes of the Al-Bu Badran and Mawali tribes. They claimed the area east of the Ottoman garrison. =20th century= In the early 20th century, two waves of Cherkess refugees from the Caucasian War were granted lands west of the Abbasid enclosure by the Ottomans. In 1915, Armenians fleeing the Armenian Genocide were also collected in Raqqa by the Arab Ujayli family. Most of them returned to Aleppo in the 1920s, but they have since then formed the majority of Raqqa's Christian community. Raqqa Museum In the 1950s, the worldwide cotton boom stimulated an unprecedented growth of the city and the recultivation of this part of the middle Euphrates area. Cotton is still the main agricultural product of the region. The growth of the city meant, on the other hand, the removal of the archaeological remains of the city's past. The palace area is now almost covered with settlements as well as the former area of the ancient al-Raqqa (today Mishlab) and the former Abbasid industrial district (today al-Mukhtal≈£a). Only parts were archaeologically explored. The 12th-century citadel was removed in the 1950s (today DawwƒÅr as-SƒÅ'a, the clock-tower circle). In the 1980s, rescue excavations in the palace area began as well as the conservation of the Abbasid city walls with the BƒÅb BaghdƒÅd and the two main monuments intra muros, the Abbasid mosque and the Qasr al-BanƒÅt. There is a museum, known as the Raqqa Museum, housed in an administration building that was erected during the French Mandate. = Syrian Civil War and ISIL = Raqqa city map In March 2013, during the Syrian Civil War, Islamist jihadist militants from Al-Nusra Front and other groups (including the Free Syrian Army) overran the government loyalists in the city during the Battle of Raqqa and declared it under their control after they had taken the central square and pulled down the statue of the former president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad. The Al Qaeda-affiliated Al- Nusra Front set up a sharia court at the sports centre and in early June 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant said that it was open to receive complaints at its Raqqa headquarters. Migrations Migration from Aleppo, Homs, Idlib and other inhabited places to the city occurred as a result of the ongoing civil war in the country, and Raqqa was known as the hotel of the revolution by some because of the number of people who moved there. Control by the Islamic State (January 2014‚ÄìOctober 2017) Destroyed neighborhood in Raqqa in August 2017 ISIL took complete control of Raqqa by 13 January 2014. ISIL proceeded to execute Alawites and suspected supporters of Bashar al-Assad in the city and destroyed the city's Shia mosques and Christian churchesAsia News. 27 September 2013, As jihadist rebels burn two Catholic churches in al-Raqqah, Assad's enemies openly split such as the Armenian Catholic Church of the Martyrs, which was then converted into an ISIL police headquarters and an Islamic centre, tasked to recruit new fighters. The Christian population of Raqqa, which had been estimated to be as much as 10% of the total population before the civil war began, largely fled the city. On 15 November 2015, France, in response to attacks in Paris two days earlier, dropped about 20 bombs on multiple ISIL targets in Raqqa. Pro- government sources said that an anti-IS uprising took place between 5 and 7 March 2016. On 26 October 2016, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that an offensive to take Raqqa from IS would begin within weeks. The SDF, supported by the US, launched the Second Battle of Raqqa on 6 June 2017 and declared victory in the city on 17 October 2017. Bombardment by the US-led coalition led to destruction of most of the city, including civilian infrastructure.The Islamic State Is Gone. But Raqqa Lies in Pieces Time, October 2017.Raqqa: US coalition 'wiped city off Earth', Russia says BBC, 22 October 2017. Some 270,000 people were said to have fled Raqqa with no homes to which to return.Raqqa: Isis 'capital' liberated by US-backed forces - but civilians face months of hardship with city left devastated The Independent, 17 October 2017. Aftermath At the end of October 2017, the government of Syria issued a statement that said: \\"Syria considers the claims of the United States and its so-called alliance about the liberation of Raqqa city from ISIS to be lies aiming to divert international public opinion from the crimes committed by this alliance in Raqqa province.... more than 90% of Raqqa city has been leveled due to the deliberate and barbaric bombardment of the city and the towns near it by the alliance, which also destroyed all services and infrastructures and forced tens of thousands of locals to leave the city and become refugees. Syria still considers Raqqa to be an occupied city, and it can only be considered liberated when the Syrian Arab Army enters it\\".Foreign Ministry: Raqqa still occupied, can only be considered liberated when Syrian Army enters it SANA, 29 October 2017. Control by Syrian Democratic Forces (October 2017‚Äìpresent) A Raqqa Internal Security Forces (RISF) member inspecting vehicles at a checkpoint, 18 August 2018 By June 2019, 300,000 residents had returned to the city, including 90,000 IDPs, and many shops in the city have reopened. By the efforts of the Global Coalition and the Raqqa Civil Council, several public hospitals and schools have been reopened, public buildings like the stadium, the Raqqa Museum, mosques and parks have been restored, anti-extremism educational centers for youth have been established and the rebuilding and restoration of roads, roundabouts and bridges, installation of solar-powered street lighting, water restoration, demining, re-institution of public transportation and rubble removal has taken place. However, the Global Coalition's funding of the stabilization of the region has been limited, and the Coalition has stated that any large scale aid will be halted until a peace agreement for the future of Syria through the Geneva process has been reached. Rebuilding of residential houses and commercial buildings has been placed solely in the hands of civilians, there is a continued presence of rubble, unreliable electricity and water access in some areas, schools still lacking basic services and the presence of ISIL sleeper cells and IEDs. Some sporadic protests against the SDF have taken place in the city in the summer of 2018. On 7 February 2019, the SDF media center announced the capture of 63 ISIL operatives in the city. According to the SDF, the operatives were a part of a sleeper cell and were all arrested within a 24-hour time span, ending the day-long curfew that was imposed on the city the day before. In mid-February 2019, a mass grave holding an estimated 3,500 bodies was discovered below a plot of farmland in the Al-Fukheikha agricultural suburb. It was the largest mass grave discovered post-ISIL rule thus far. The bodies were reported to be the victims of executions when ISIL ruled the city. In 2019 a project called the \\"Shelter Project\\" was launched by international organisations in coordination with the Raqqa Civil Council, providing funding to residents of partially destroyed buildings in order to aid with their reconstruction. In April 2019 the rehabilitation of the Old Raqqa Bridge over the Euphrates was finished. The bridge was originally built by British forces during World War Two in 1942. The National Hospital in Raqqa was reopened after rehabilitation work in May 2019. As a consequence of the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, the SDF called on the Syrian Arab Army to enter the areas under its rule, including in the area of Raqqa as part of a deal to prevent Turkish troops from capturing any more territory in northern Syria.  Scanning for Syria project (2017‚Äì2018)  The Raqqa Museum had numerous clay tablets with cuneiform writing and many other objects vanishing in the fog of war. A particular set of those tablets were excavated by archaeologists from Leiden at the Tell Sabi Abyad. The excavation team casted silicone rubber moulds of the tablets before the war to create cast copies for subsequent studies in the Netherlands. As the original tablets were looted, those moulds became the only evidence of parts of the 12th century BC in Northern Syria. Having a lifespan of roughly thirty years, the moulds proved not be a durable solution, hence the need for digitization to counter the loss of the originals. Therefore the Scanning for Syria (SfS) project was initiated by the Leiden University and Delft University of Technology under the auspices of the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Global Heritage and Development. The project received a NWO‚ÄìKIEM Creatieve Industrie grant to use of 3D acquisition and 3D printing technology to make high quality reproductions of the clay tablets. In collaboration with the Catholic University of Louvain and the Heidelberg University several imaging technologies were explored to find the best solution to capture the precious texts hidden within the concavities of the moulds. In the end, the X-ray micro-CT scanner housed at the TU Delft laboratory of Geoscience and Engineering turned out to be a good compromise between time-efficiency, accuracy and text recovery. Accurate digital 3D reconstructions of the original clay tablets were created using the CT data of the silicon moulds. Furthermore, the Forensic Computational Geometry Laboratory in Heidelberg dramatically decreased the time for decipherment of a tablet by automatically computing high quality images using the GigaMesh Software Framework. These images clearly show the cuneiform characters in publication quality, which otherwise would have taken many hours to manually craft a matching drawing. The 3D-models and high-quality images have become accessible to both scholar and non-scholar communities worldwide. Physical replicas were produced using 3D-printing. The 3D-prints serve as teaching material in Assyriology classes as well as for visitors of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden to experience the ingenuity of Assyrian cuneiform writing. In 2020 the SfS has received the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage of the Europa Nostra in the category research.  Ecclesiastical history  In the 6th century, Kallinikos became a center of Assyrian monasticism. Dayra d'MƒÅr ZakkƒÅ, or the Saint Zacchaeus monastery, situated on Tall al-Bi'a, became renowned. A mosaic inscription there is dated to the year 509, presumably from the period of the foundation of the monastery. Daira d'MƒÅr ZakkƒÅ is mentioned by various sources up to the 10th century. The second important monastery in the area was the Bƒ´z≈´nƒÅ monastery or DairƒÅ d-Es≈£unƒÅ, the 'monastery of the column'. The city became one of the main cities of the historical DiyƒÅr Mu·∏çar, the western part of the Jazƒ´ra. Michael the Syrian records twenty Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) bishops from the 8th to the 12th centuries‚Äîand had at least four monasteries, of which the Saint Zaccheus Monastery remained the most prominent. In the 9th century, when Raqqa served as capital of the western half of the Abbasid Caliphate, Dayra d'MƒÅr ZakkƒÅ, or the Saint Zacchaeus Monastery, became the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, one of several rivals for the apostolic succession of the Ancient patriarchal see, which has several more rivals of Catholic and Orthodox churches. = Bishopric = Callinicum early became the seat of a Christian diocese. In 388, Byzantine Emperor Theodosius the Great was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the synagogue. He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop. Ambrose wrote to Theodosius, pointing out he was thereby \\"exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death\\", and Theodosius rescinded his decree.A.D. Lee, From Rome to Byzantium AD 363 to 565 (Oxford University Press 2013 ) Bishop Damianus of Callinicum took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and in 458 was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province wrote to Emperor Leo I the Thracian after the death of Proterius of Alexandria. In 518 Paulus was deposed for having joined the anti-Chalcedonian Severus of Antioch. Callinicum had a Bishop Ioannes in the mid-6th century.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae , Leipzig 1931, p. 437Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus , Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 969‚Äì972 In the same century, a Notitia Episcopatuum lists the diocese as a suffragan of Edessa, the capital and metropolitan see of Osrhoene.Sim√©on Vailh√© in √âchos d'Orient 1907, p. 94 e p. 145 . = Titular sees = No longer a residential bishopric, Callinicum has been listed by the Catholic Church twice as a titular see, as suffragan of the Metropolitan of the Late Roman province of Osroene : first as Latin - (meanwhile suppressed) and currently as Maronite titular bishopric.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 856  Callinicum of the Romans  No later than the 18th century, the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Callinicum (Latin), adjective Callinicen(sis) (Latin) / Callinico (Curiate Italian).

The school was founded in 1966 by the Icelandic Ministry of Education; with the first graduation occurring in 1970. The school's first rector was Gu√∞mundur Arnlaugsson. The school's objective is to prepare students for rigorous tertiary studies both locally and in an international environment. It offers four Icelandic-taught programmes leading to the St√∫dentspr√≥f qualification: languages, natural sciences, social sciences and performance dance; and one English-taught programme leading to the IB Diploma. The newest addition is an \\"independent programme\\" which allows slightly more room for mixing the other ones together. The school also offers evening classes for older students and coordinates annual language tests for foreign students who wish to apply to local schools. Since foundation, the school was meant to be a pioneer project, and has therefore received relative freedom in advancing its education policy. It was the first in the country to adopt a university-style credit system, which was soon replicated by several other schools and eventually became the basis for all government-regulated upper secondary curricula. MH is one of the most selective upper secondary schools in the country., Retrieved May 9, 2013. It prides itself for its services to students with disabilities and students whose mother tongue is not Icelandic, who also enjoy priority in the selection process.

Many famous bands and artists have played in MH, including Booka Shade, Damien Rice, Rage Against the Machine, M√≠nus, Ampop, Raein, Kid Carpet and many more. Once a year Matgar√∞ur is blessed with holy water that priest P√°lmi Matth√≠asson blessed. =Mi√∞gar√∞ur= Mi√∞gar√∞ur (named after the realm of men in Norse mythology) is on the second floor and has seats and tables for around 200-300 students. It also houses a large percentage of the school's computers. The biggest landmark in Mi√∞gar√∞ur is undoubtedly Mi√∞gar√∞sormurinn, a large knitted serpent named for the one who circles Mi√∞gar√∞ur in Norse mythology. It has been in creation for many years and is now about 200 metres long. =Mikligar√∞ur= Mikligar√∞ur is the school's grand hall, used for graduation, debating competitions (Morf√≠s), choir practices and acting classes. =Nor√∞urkjallari= Nor√∞urkjallari (Northern Cellar) is one of the student lounges which also serves as the main social venue for various events. Nor√∞urkjallari houses the meeting room of the students body council, archives office, and the photographers' dark room. It is also the only place in the school that does not have a wireless network connection, the theory being that students do not study there, the connection would not be used for academic purposes, and therefore it is not justifiable. Nor√∞urkjallari is divided into different areas, all given historical names. The main entrance hall is called S√≥mal√≠a, where students are able to buy soft drinks and coffee. This area leads into Texas and Undirheimar, a corridor which leads to Himnar√≠ki (Heaven), Marar√æaraborg, Nem√≥ and Atlantis. Further inside, Bessasta√∞ir's entrance hides behind a sofa along with the mysterious always-locked door to MH's Undirheimar. =Undirheimar= Undirheimar (\\"the Underworld\\") is a place hidden beneath Mi√∞gar√∞ur and has been shrouded in mystery for many years. Formerly used as a concert space and student lounge, with a full-size Viking ship on the south wall, because of the low ceiling and lack of proper fire exits. Undirheimar are now used for the acting committee, they have acting practises and shows there. The locked doors to Undirheimar can be found in Nor√∞urkjallari, next to Bessasta√∞ir, and next to the yellow lockers beneath Mi√∞gar√∞ur's north staircase. =√ötgar√∞ur= Finally, √ötgar√∞ur is a natural haven located in the central section of the school building. This garden often serves as a venue for courses doing outdoor experiments. It also creates a soothing backdrop for the classrooms surrounding the area; indeed, one entire wall of Mi√∞gar√∞ur is a window into the world of √ötgar√∞ur. =Gym= The students' gym was finally finished in 2006 and is located in the new building. It has three separate areas: a gym hall, a fitness center and a multi-purpose room (used for various things like ballet, yoga, etc.) =Library= The library was also finished in 2006, and is located on the 2nd floor of the new building. It is currently the largest school library in Iceland, containing around 12.000 books. Education The school was based on the traditional class system from 1966 to 1972, when a credit based system was adopted, which allowed students to choose their own courses and earn credits towards graduation. Each course awards credits relative to its difficulty, with students averaging 30-35 credits per semester. Graduation requires 205 credits, so it typically takes three years to complete the entire program of study. The credit system has advantages: it gives students more control over their schedule and the order in which they take their courses. MH was the first school to offer evening classes catering to older students, and is the only school in Iceland to offer students the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program, which is a two- to three-year intensive program taught in English. MH is known for its amount of different and versatile subjects. It is thought to be the most diverse gymnasium in Iceland in terms of education. Languages available to learn include Icelandic, English, Sign language, Japanese, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Polish, Latin and recently Chinese Student union One of MH's biggest attractions for new students is its renowned social life, which is mostly the responsibility of the Nemendaf√©lag Menntask√≥lans vi√∞ Hamrahl√≠√∞ (\\"MH Student Association\\", usually abbreviated NFMH). The NFMH is one of the largest and most active student associations in Iceland, including various smaller internal clubs and leagues with specific roles and agendas, commonly known as St√≥rf√©lagi√∞ (\\"the great alliance\\"). NFMH is also the publisher of the famous newspaper Fr√©ttap√©si which is well known in Iceland for its crude humor and lack of morality. In 2006 Fr√©ttap√©si was a subject in the award winning news magazine Kastlj√≥s because of their article \\"10 songs to rape to\\", which caused a public outrage in Iceland. The Choir The school choir, K√≥r Menntask√≥lans vi√∞ Hamrahl√≠√∞, was founded by √ûorger√∞ur Ing√≥lfsd√≥ttir, in cooperation with the rector, Gu√∞mundur Arnlaugsson, in 1967, a year after the school's opening. Students who are members of the choir normally leave the choir upon graduation, but many alumni join Hamrahl√≠√∞ark√≥rinn, also conducted by √ûorger√∞ur Ing√≥lfsd√≥ttir. Hamrahl√≠√∞ark√≥rinn was established in 1982 by members of the school choir who wanted to continue to work and perform with √ûorger√∞ur after graduating from MH. =Marar√æaraborg= Marar√æaraborg is a small store run by members of the choir. The store's revenues are used to fund various choir activities. The store is named after the Icelandic title of a children's book by Ingebrigt Davik called √Üfint√Ωri √≠ Marar√æaraborg, or Det hende i Taremareby in the original Norwegian. School Newspapers The student accisation of MH (NFMH) publishes two student papers, Beneventum and the gossip oriented Fr√©ttap√©si. The later has received heavy criticism through the years for harassing students and promoting sexualised freshmen competitions.

He was active in Tamil cinema during the latter half of the 20th century. He was known for his versatility and the variety of roles he depicted on screen, which gave him also the Tamil nickname Nadigar Thilagam (). In a career that spanned close to five decades, he had acted in 288 films in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi. Ganesan was the first Indian film actor to win a \\"Best Actor\\" award in an International film festival, the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in Cairo, Egypt in 1960. Many leading South Indian film actors have stated that their acting was influenced by Ganesan. In addition, he received four Filmfare Awards South and a National Film Award (Special Jury). In 1997, Ganesan was conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest honour for films in India. He was also the first Indian actor to be made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Ganesan is remembered as an iconic figure of Tamil cinema. Upon his death, The Los Angeles Times described him as \\"the Marlon Brando of south India's film industry\\".  Early life  Annai Illam Sivaji House Ganesan was born Ganesamoorthy on 1 October 1928, the fourth son of Chinnaiya Manrayar and Rajamani Ammal in Villupuram,https://www.deccanherald.com/content/573487/sivaji-ganesan- remembered-88th-birth.html India. Early in his career, Ganesan acted under the name V.C. Ganesan. Media outlets said that the initials stood for Villupuram Chinnaiya Ganesan, though one of Ganesan's sons stated that the initial 'V' stands for Vettaithidal, a village from which their family originates. Without his father's consent, Ganesan decided to join a touring stage drama company at the age of seven. At the age of 10, he moved to Tiruchirappalli and joined a drama troupe in Sangiliyandapuram and began to perform in stage plays. From the drama troupe trainers, he was fortunate enough to learn acting and dancing. He was trained in Bharatanatyam, Kathak and Manipuri dance forms. Ganesan exhibited the ability to remember lengthy lines easily. The group favoured Ganesan to play the lead and he would continue to do so. His portrayal of Shivaji in the stage play Shivaji Kanda Hindu Rajyam earned him the name \\"Sivaji\\", which was conferred on him at a public function presided over by social reformer E. V. Ramasamy. Since then, he was referred to by the name of \\"Sivaji\\".  Film career  = Early career: 1952‚Äì1959 = Two factors can be attributed the entry of Ganesan into films: The principal artists in Tamil films during the 1940s and 1950s were Telugus, whose acting was not matched by their dialogue delivery in Tamil. (In fact, Sivaji Ganesan lent his voice to Mukkamala Krishna Murthy, a Telugu actor, for a Tamil film Niraparathi. The film was well received by the Tamil audience.) Secondly, the 1950s saw the growth of the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu, under the leadership of C. N. Annadurai, and M. Karunanidhi. Their transformation of language skills to films through script writing ensured their instant acceptance. Ganesan's entry into films at this stage of popularity was easy and inevitable, and he could establish himself in a better position. Ganesan made his acting debut in the 1952 Tamil film Parasakthi, which was directed by the Krishnan-Panju duo and co-starred actress Pandari Bai. M.Karunanidhi recommended him for the lead role in Parasakthi to the producer, which was supposed to be portrayed by K R Ramasamy.. The script was written by later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi. Since actors who are well- trained in classical dance can effectively showcase expressions called Nava Rasa on their faces, Ganesan went on to become one of the popular actors in Tamil cinema in the 1950s. His unique voice had a greater appeal. His style of dialogue delivery with a long spell of dialogues ‚Äî like a poetry recitation with much clarity ‚Äî earned him critical recognition. Andha Naal (1954) was a trendsetter in Tamil cinema because it had no songs and Ganesan played an anti-hero. The film won the president's silver medal the following year. The same year, he co-starred with his competitor M. G. Ramachandran in Koondukkili, where he played the antagonist. = Donning versatile roles: 1954‚Äì1968 = His role in the film Veerapandiya Kattabomman won him the Best Actor Award at the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in March 1960 at Cairo.The making of an actor , THE HINDU Sunday, 4 August 2008 Incidentally, Ganesan was also the first Indian actor to get an award for Best Actor abroad. Often considered to be a landmark film in Tamil cinema, Pasamalar is arguably one of the best films of Sivaji Ganesan and Savitri together. Once again directed by A Bhimsingh, the film has a cult following and rightly so. When it released in 1961, it became a trendsetter of sorts and was a money spinner at the box- office. Post its release, several films based on a similar theme were made, for example, Mullum Malarum. It also won the National Award that year and was remade in several languages. Sivaji Ganesan has acted in many Tamil movies co- starring with many popular and talented Tamil actresses of his time. He gave many commercial success films such as Palum Pazhamum, Kappalottiya Thamizhan, Karnan, Kai Koduttha Dheivam, Puthiya Paravai and his 100th film, Navarathri. who began his career as a stage artiste at the age of nine. It one of Sivaji Ganesan's best films in its tribute to the actor. His flair for comedy was showcased very well in several blockbuster movies such as Kalyanam Panniyum Brahmachari (1954), Sabaash Meena (1958), Ooty Varai Uravu (1967), Galatta Kalyanam (1968) and many more in which he partnered with other super stars like T. R. Ramachandran, J. P. Chandrababu, Nagesh and others, delivering some of his most memorable performances. = Puranic and historical roles: 1965‚Äì1969 = His portrayal of Lord Shiva in the movie Thiruvilayadal (1965) won him many accolades. Ganesan could strike a balance between commercial cinema, Mythological cinema and experimental cinema. His epical portrayals in films such as Thiruvilayaadal, Thiruvarutselvar, Saraswati Sabatham, Thirumal Perumai and Thillana Mohanambal won him critical acclaim. He played a variety of roles such as freedom fighters, like Tiruppur Kumaran, Bhagat Singh and epic characters like Karna, Bharatha, Narada, Appar, Nayanmars and Alwars. Spanning genres like epics to Crime thrillers; from romantic escapades to comic flicks and action flicks, Ganesan has covered it all. = Superstardom ‚Äì varied roles: 1970‚Äì1979 = Ganesan played supporting role to Rajendra Kumar in the Hindi film Dharti in 1970, which was a remake of his 1969 Tamil film Sivandha Mann, in which he played the lead role. In the Hindi version, Ganesan played the role which Muthuraman had played in the original. Several directors such as Krishnan-Panju, T. R. Sundaram, T. R. Ramanna, A. P. Nagarajan, L. V. Prasad, B. R. Panthulu, T. Prakash Rao, Dasari Yoganand, A. Bhim Singh, K. Shankar, C. V. Sridhar, A. C. Tirulokchandar, P. Madhavan, K. S. Gopalakrishnan, Muktha V.Srinivasan, C. V. Rajendran, and K. Vijayan directed Ganesan in different roles. Kongara Jaggayya offered his voice to Sivaji when his movies were dubbed into Telugu. In the 1960s and 1970s his films have been well received and he was able to deliver constant hits. Some of his famous hits during this period are Vasantha Maligai, Gauravam, Thanga Pathakkam and Sathyam. Many of his films inspired remakes in Sinhalese. Films such as Pilot Premnath and Mohana Punnagai were shot in Sri Lanka, with Sri Lankan actors such as Malini Fonseka and Geetha Kumarasinghe playing the female lead. In 1979, he appeared in the biggest blockbuster of his career, Thirisoolam his 200th film, an adaptation of the Kannada film Shankar Guru in which Rajkumar had played the lead role. = Matured roles: 1980‚Äì1999 = The 1980s was a period in which Ganesan started enacting more matured roles. But still films such as Rishi Moolam, Yamanukku Yaman and Chiranjeevi had Ganesan portraying lead roles. Muthal Mariyathai (1985) won him a Filmfare Award and Tamil Nadu State film Award under Best Actor category. In 1992, he acted with Kamal Haasan in the critically acclaimed Thevar Magan, which won him a Special Mention Award at the 40th National Film Awards. His other films released during this period are Pasumpon, Once More, En Aasai Rasave and Mannavaru Chinnavaru, where he was cast in prominent roles. He worked in Pooparika Varugirom, which released as his last film before his death, however the last film he worked in before his death was Padayappa (1999).  Mentor  Chinna Ponnusamy Padayatchi is the teacher of theatrical arts who trained Ganesan in his troupe. During an interview with V.S. Srinivasan, Ganesan said: \\"Theatre has taught me everything. My teacher (Chinna Ponnuswamy Padayachi of Chidambaram) taught me Bharatnatyam, acting, body movements & practically everything. Padayachi, was himself an outstanding stage actor and I learnt in an atmosphere that was reminiscent of an ashram school.\\"  Political career  Sivaji Ganesan (far left) with M. Karunanidhi next to him. Until 1955, Ganesan was a staunch sympathiser of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Once, he went to the Tirumala town in Tirupati district and worshiped Lord Venkateswara in the world-famous temple there. Due to this act, he was heavily criticised by his party men; as DMK propounded atheism and looked down worshiping God. Ganesan was very hurt by this incident. Later in 1961, Ganesan became a strong supporter of the Indian National Congress. Due to his popularity, he was requested to be part of the National Congress Tamil Nadu. His respect for Kamaraj made him support Congress. He was made the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi's death in 1984 also brought Ganesan's political career to an end. After 1988, he floated his own political party (Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani) and contested in only 50 seats, trying to play safe instead of contesting in all seats which possibly cost him the chance to win the elections because 50 seats would not make a significant difference to any election result. In 1989, he became the President of the Tamil Nadu wing of the Janata Dal. Unlike his highly successful acting career, his political career was rather unsuccessful.  Family  Ganesan was the fourth son of his family. He had three brothers and one sister. Ganesan married Kamala in 1952 and had four children. His younger son Prabhu is a notable Tamil actor. Ganesan established a film production company in the late 1950s, now called Sivaji Productions, which is now being looked after by his eldest son Ramkumar. He has two daughters Shanthi and Thenmozhi. Three of his grandsons have also appeared in films, with Ramkumar's two sons Dushyanth Ramkumar and Shivaji Dev, both having the stage name of Junior Sivaji. Moreover, Vikram Prabhu debuted in the critically acclaimed film Kumki in 2012. =Friendships= Sivaji was known to have strong lifelong friendships with Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Lata Mangeshkar. Lata Mangeshkar considered him her brother and regularly visited each other when they were either in Madras and/or Bombay respectively.  Death  Suffering from respiratory problems, Ganesan was admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Chennai on 1 July 2001. He also had been suffering from a prolonged heart ailment for about 10 years. He died at 7:45 pm (IST) on 21 July 2001 at the age of 72 just three months prior to his 73rd birthday for which he had special plans. A documentary Parasakthi Muthal Padayappa Varai was made to commemorate Sivaji Ganesan's legacy. His funeral the next day was telecast live on Sun TV and was attended by thousands of viewers, politicians and personalities from the South Indian film fraternity.Sivaji: The legend lives on , Business Line, Tue 24 July 2001 His eldest son, Ramkumar, performed his last rites at the Besant Nagar Crematorium, Chennai.  Popularity  Ganesan Statue on Kamarajar Road in Chennai When President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt visited India, Sivaji Ganesan was the only individual granted permission by the then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, to host a party for Nasser. Nasser was given a number of valuable mementos depicting the civilisation and culture of South India.Padmabushan Chevalier Dr.'Sivaji' V.C. Ganesan , sivajiprabhu.com Sivaji Ganesan was the first artist from India to visit the United States, in the cultural exchange programme of the US government, in 1962, invited by the then-US President John F. Kennedy, where he took the role of India's cultural ambassador. During his visit there, he was honoured by being made the honorary mayor of Niagara Falls, New York for one day and was presented the golden key to the city. The only other Indian who has had this honour before Ganesan was Jawaharlal Nehru. When Sivaji returned from America, there was a huge crowd to receive him at the Madras Airport and M. G. Ramachandran was there. When Sivaji returned from Egypt after winning the best actor award, there was a huge crowd to receive him at the Madras Airport. On 22 March 1976, he went over to Mauritius on an invitation from Prime Minister Ramagoolam and took part in their independence day celebrations and stayed as their government guest for four days. During his visit to the United States in June 1995, he visited Columbus, Ohio. Participating in the dinner hosted to honour Ganesan, the Mayor of the city, Greg Lashutka honoured him by announcing him as an honorary citizen of Columbus. On the same occasion, the Mayor of Mount Vernon read out and gave him a special welcome citation. The Columbus Tamil Sangam was formulated on that day and Ganesan was made the honorary President of that association. Although Sivaji appeared less in leading roles after the 1980s, his supporting roles were received positively, as in Thevar Magan, which won him the National Awards Jury's Special Jury award in 1993. Sivaji, incidentally, declined the award.Sivaji Ganesan: Tamil cinema's versatile actor par excellence , DBSJeyaraj.com, 26 July 2014  Acclaim  Sivaji Ganesan is considered as one of the best Indian actors of all time. He was also acknowledged as a consummate actor and one of the most imitated ones. He was praised for his body language and his resounding voice and dialogue delivery. Ganesan is known for his versatility and has acted as a blind man in Paalum Pazhumum, a physically handicapped person in Bhaagapirivinai, enacting Nine numbers of totally different personas from various social strata and the corresponding body language (gait, voice, facial expression, etc.) in \\" Navarathiri\\", thereby becoming probably the first-time in Indian cinema history as an actor reprising Nine roles in a single film and in extension, inspiring subsequent films (at least) in Tamil like \\"Navarathinam\\" (the great MGR ‚Äì starred), \\"Dasavatharam\\" (featuring Sivaji's torch-bearer Kamal Haasan), a man with a scared face as in Deiva Magan, a murderer in Pudhiya Paravai, or a traitor as in Andha Naal, the first movie that had no songs at all.

Dickinson won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for both Tulku (1979) and City of Gold (1980), each being recognised as the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject. Through 2020 he is one of eight writers to win two Carnegies; no one has won three. He was also a highly commended runner-up for Eva (1988) and four times a commended runner-up. For his contributions as a children's writer Dickinson was a finalist for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 2000. Life Dickinson was born in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), the second of the four sons of a man in the colonial service and a farmer's daughter. As a child he loved stories about knights in armour and explorers, such as Ivanhoe and King Solomon's Mines, and read \\"anything by Kipling\\", who influenced his writing greatly. His parents moved to England so that he and his brothers could attend English schools. His father died suddenly but Dickinson entered Saint Ronan's prep school in 1936 with support from the family. His novel Hindsight is based on the period in Devon after the school was evacuated from Kent during the war. He entered Eton College in 1941. Dickinson remained at Eton until 1946. After completing his National Service (1946‚Äì48), he studied at King's College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1951. For seventeen years he worked as assistant editor, resident poet and reviewer for Punch magazine.Townsend (1978), 371. His first two books were published in 1968 and were very well received, one mystery for adults and one science fiction for children. He completed sequels to both debut novels and left Punch to be a full-time author next year. He continued to write poetry for entertainment and occasionally on commission. Dickinson married Mary Rose Barnard in 1953; the couple had two daughters and two sons including the author John Dickinson. Mary Rose died in 1988, the same year that their first two grandchildren were born. As of 2009 there are six grandchildren. In 1983, Dickinson had met Robin McKinley, an American author of fantasy, some written for children. After a long friendship, they married in 1991. She said in 2009 that she cannot judge the literary work of people she likes personally, but: \\"Fortunately I had been passionately devoted to his books years before I met him so I can merely go on thinking they're wonderful and he's brilliant now.\\"McKinley, Robin (2009). \\"Are you married? Do you have any children?\\". Retrieved 21 November 2012. Dickinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999 and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. He was also chairman of the Society of Authors. For years he listed manual labour as one pastime; at 85 he listed only bridge and gardening. He died after an illness on 16 December 2015, his 88th birthday. Writer Dickinson published almost fifty books, which fall into three general categories: crime fiction for adults (including the James Pibble series), speculative and supernatural fiction for older children, and simpler children's books. One of his few other books was the collection Chance, Luck and Destiny (1975), which he calls \\"prose and verse, fact and fiction, on the themes of the title\\". It won the second annual Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award for children's nonfiction in 1977. The \\"Changes\\" trilogy comprises three early books for children, The Weathermonger, Heartsease and The Devil's Children (1968 to 1970). (ISFDB). Retrieved 12 July 2012. It was heavily adapted in 1975 as a BBC TV series, The Changes. The trilogy was written in reverse order: The Devil's Children is actually the first book in terms of the trilogy's chronology, Heartsease the second, and The Weathermonger the third. Dickinson's first two mysteries both won the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger, Skin Deep in 1968 and A Pride of Heroes in 1969. He was at least as successful with his children's books. He won the 1977 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize for The Blue Hawk, an award judged by British children's writers, which no author may win twice. For Tulku (1979) he won both the Whitbread Children's Book Award and finally the Carnegie Medal after being a commended runner-up three times. He won the Carnegie again next year for City of Gold. In 1982 he was named to the International Board of Books for Young People Honor List for Tulku, and The Iron Lion was selected one of New York Times Notable Books. Eva (1988) was a runner-up for both the Carnegie (highly commended) and the Horn Book Award. In 2008 it won the Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. Dickinson and The Seventh Raven (1981) had won the same award in 2001. The Kin (1998) made the Whitbread Award shortlist. Kin series listing at ISFDB. Retrieved 12 July 2012. City of Gold and other stories from the Old Testament (Gollancz, 1980), illustrated by Michael Foreman, was a \\"radical\\" retelling of 33 stories, according to the retrospective online Carnegie Medal citation. \\"It is set in a time before the Bible was written down, when its stories where handed from generation to generation by the spoken word.\\" Illustrator Foreman was highly commended runner-up for the Library Association's companion Kate Greenaway Medal. A pair of alternative history novels, King and Joker (1976) and Skeleton-in-Waiting (1989), are based on the premise that Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (1864‚Äì1892) survives and ultimately reigns as Victor I of England. The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Dickinson was one of five finalists for the writing award in 2000 (and the British nominee in 1988 as well). A collection of his own previously published and new poetry, The Weir: Poems by Peter Dickinson, was published on the occasion of his 80th birthday in 2007, as a gift from his four children. His last works were Earth and Air (Small Beer Press, 2012), and In the Palace of the Khans (Peter Dickinson Books, 2012). The former continues the \\"Tales of Elemental Spirits\\" whose first two volumes Water and Fire comprise stories by both Dickinson and Robin McKinley. Dickinson's literary archive is one of those in the Seven Stories National Centre for Children's Books.\\"Collection authors & illustrators\\". Seven Stories: National Centre for Children's Books. Retrieved 20 December 2012. Motion pictures In 1982, Rankin/Bass Productions released The Flight of Dragons, a made-for-TV animated film, aspects of which were based on Dickinson's book. The character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book. However, the novel The Dragon and the George by Gordon R. Dickson was the inspiration for the film's plot. One of the main characters is Peter Dickinson, the book's author himself struggling to complete his text.

The dependency issue arises around shared packages or libraries on which several other packages have dependencies but where they depend on different and incompatible versions of the shared packages. If the shared package or library can only be installed in a single version, the user may need to address the problem by obtaining newer or older versions of the dependent packages. This, in turn, may break other dependencies and push the problem to another set of packages.  Problems  Dependency hell takes several forms: ; Many dependencies : An application depends on many libraries, requiring lengthy downloads, large amounts of disk space, and being very portable (all libraries are already ported enabling the application itself to be ported easily). It can also be difficult to locate all the dependencies, which can be fixed by having a repository (see below). This is partly inevitable; an application built on a given computing platform (such as Java) requires that platform to be installed, but further applications do not require it. This is a particular problem if an application uses a small part of a big library (which can be solved by code refactoring), or a simple application relies on many libraries. ; Long chains of dependencies : If depends on , which depends on , ..., which depends on . This is distinct from \\"many dependencies\\" if the dependencies must be resolved manually (e.g., on attempting to install , the user is prompted to install first. On attempting to install , the user is then prompted to install , and so on.). Sometimes, however, during this long chain of dependencies, conflicts arise where two different versions of the same package are required (see conflicting dependencies below). These long chains of dependencies can be solved by having a package manager that resolves all dependencies automatically. Other than being a hassle (to resolve all the dependencies manually), manual resolution can mask dependency cycles or conflicts. ; Conflicting dependencies : If depends on , and depends on , and different versions of cannot be simultaneously installed, then and cannot simultaneously be used (or installed, if the installer checks dependencies). When possible, this is solved by allowing simultaneous installations of the different dependencies. Alternatively, the existing dependency, along with all software that depends on it, must be uninstalled in order to install the new dependency. A problem on Linux systems with installing packages from a different distributor (which is not recommended or even supposed to work) is that the resulting long chain of dependencies may lead to a conflicting version of the C standard library (e.g. the GNU C Library), on which thousands of packages depend. If this happens, the user will be prompted to uninstall all those packages. ; Circular dependencies : If depends upon and can't run without a specific version of , but , in turn, depends upon and can't run without a specific version of , then upgrading any application will break another. This scheme can be deeper in branching. Its impact can be quite heavy, if it affects core systems or update software itself: a package manager (A), which requires specific run-time library (B) to function, may brick itself (A) in the middle of the process when upgrading this library (B) to next version. Due to incorrect library (B) version, the package manager (A) is now broken- thus no rollback or downgrade of library (B) is possible. The usual solution is to download and deploy both applications, sometimes from within a temporary environment. ; Package manager dependencies : It is possible for dependency hell to result from installing a prepared package via a package manager (e.g. APT), but this is unlikely since major package managers have matured and official repositories are well maintained. This is the case with current releases of Debian and major derivates such as Ubuntu. Dependency hell, however, can result from installing a package directly via a package installer (e.g. RPM or dpkg). ;Diamond dependency :When a library A depends on libraries B and C, both B and C depend on library D, but B requires version D.1 and C requires version D.2. The build fails because only one version of D can exist in the final executable : Package managers like yum, are prone to have conflicts between packages of their repositories, causing dependency hell in Linux distributions such as CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  Solutions  ; Version numbering : A very common solution to this problem is to have a standardized numbering system, wherein software uses a specific number for each version (aka major version), and also a subnumber for each revision (aka minor version), e.g.: 10.1, or 5.7. The major version only changes when programs that used that version will no longer be compatible. The minor version might change with even a simple revision that does not prevent other software from working with it. In cases like this, software packages can then simply request a component that has a particular major version, and any minor version (greater than or equal to a particular minor version). As such, they will continue to work, and dependencies will be resolved successfully, even if the minor version changes. Semantic Versioning (aka \\"SemVer\\" ) is one example of an effort to generate a technical specification that employs specifically formatted numbers to create a software versioning scheme. ;Private per application versions : Windows File Protection introduced in Windows 2000 prevented applications from overwriting system DLLs. Developers were instead encouraged to use \\"Private DLLs\\", copies of libraries per application in the directory of the application. This uses the Windows search path characteristic that the local path is always prioritized before the system directory with the system wide libraries. This allows easy and effective shadowing of library versions by specific application ones, therefore preventing dependency hell. ; Side-by-side installation of multiple versions : The version numbering solution can be improved upon by elevating the version numbering to an operating system supported feature. This allows an application to request a module/library by a unique name and version number constraints, effectively transferring the responsibility for brokering library/module versions from the applications to the operating system. A shared module can then be placed in a central repository without the risk of breaking applications which are dependent on previous or later versions of the module. Each version gets its own entry, side by side with other versions of the same module. : This solution is used in Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows Vista, where the Global Assembly Cache is an implementation of such a central registry with associated services and integrated with the installation system/package manager. Gentoo Linux solves this problem with a concept called slotting, which allows multiple versions of shared libraries to be installed.Slotting on gentoo.org ; Smart package management : Some package managers can perform smart upgrades, in which interdependent software components are upgraded at the same time, thereby resolving the major number incompatibility issue too. : Many current Linux distributions have also implemented repository-based package management systems to try to solve the dependency problem. These systems are a layer on top of the RPM, dpkg, or other packaging systems that are designed to automatically resolve dependencies by searching in predefined software repositories. Examples of these systems include Apt, Yum, Urpmi, ZYpp, Portage, Pacman and others. Typically, the software repositories are FTP sites or websites, directories on the local computer or shared across a network or, much less commonly, directories on removable media such as CDs or DVDs. This eliminates dependency hell for software packaged in those repositories, which are typically maintained by the Linux distribution provider and mirrored worldwide. Although these repositories are often huge, it is not possible to have every piece of software in them, so dependency hell can still occur. In all cases, dependency hell is still faced by the repository maintainers. : PC- BSD, up to and including version 8.2, a predecessor of TrueOS (an operating system based on FreeBSD) avoids dependency hell by placing packages and dependencies into self-contained directories in /Programs, which avoids breakage if system libraries are upgraded or changed. It uses its own \\"PBI\\" (Push Button Installer) for package management.pbiDIR ; Installer options : Because different pieces of software have different dependencies, it is possible to get into a vicious circle of dependency requirements, or an ever- expanding tree of requirements, as each new package demands several more be installed. Systems such as Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool can resolve this by presenting the user with a range of solutions, and allowing the user to accept or reject the solutions, as desired. ; Easy adaptability in programming : If application software is designed in such a way that its programmers are able to easily adapt the interface layer that deals with the OS, window manager or desktop environment to new or changing standards, then the programmers would only have to monitor notifications from the environment creators or component library designers and quickly adjust their software with updates for their users, all with minimal effort and a lack of costly and time-consuming redesign. This method would encourage programmers to pressure those upon whom they depend to maintain a reasonable notification process that is not onerous to anyone involved. ; Strict compatibility requirement in code development and maintenance : If the applications and libraries are developed and maintained with guaranteed downward compatibility in mind, any application or library can be replaced with a newer version at any time without breaking anything. While this does not alleviate the multitude of dependency, it does make the jobs of package managers or installers much easier. ; Software appliances : Another approach to avoiding dependency issues is to deploy applications as a software appliance. A software appliance encapsulates dependencies in a pre-integrated self-contained unit such that users no longer have to worry about resolving software dependencies. Instead the burden is shifted to developers of the software appliance. ; Portable applications : An application (or version of an existing conventional application) that is completely self-contained and requires nothing to be already installed. It is coded to have all necessary components included, or is designed to keep all necessary files within its own directory, and will not create a dependency problem. These are often able to run independently of the system to which they are connected. Applications in RISC OS and the ROX Desktop for Linux use application directories, which work in much the same way: programs and their dependencies are self-contained in their own directories (folders). : This method of distribution has also proven useful when porting applications designed for Unix-like platforms to Windows, the most noticeable drawback being multiple installations of the same shared libraries. For example, Windows installers for gedit, GIMP, and XChat all include identical copies of the GTK+ toolkit, which these programs use to render widgets. On the other hand, if different versions of GTK+ are required by each application, then this is the correct behavior and successfully avoids dependency hell.

It is an isomer of n-butyric acid. It is classified as a short-chain fatty acid. Deprotonation or esterification gives derivatives called isobutyrates. Isobutyric acid is a colorless liquid with a somewhat unpleasant odor. It is soluble in water and organic solvents. It is found naturally in carobs (Ceratonia siliqua), in vanilla, and in the root of Arnica dulcis, and as an ethyl ester in croton oil. Production Isobutyric acid is manufactured by the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde, which is a byproduct of the hydroformylation of propylene. It can also be prepared by the high pressure hydrocarboxylation (Koch reaction) from propylene: :CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ CO + H2O ‚Üí (CH3)2CHCO2H Isobutyric acid can also be manufactured commercially using engineered bacteria with a sugar feedstock. =Laboratory methods= Many routes are known including the hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile with alkalis and the oxidation of isobutanol with potassium dichromate in the presence of sulfuric acid. In the presence of proton donors, the action of sodium amalgam on methacrylic acid also gives isobutyric acid. Reactions The acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. Its acid chloride is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others. When heated with a chromic acid solution it is oxidized to acetone. Alkaline potassium permanganate oxidizes it to Œ±-hydroxyisobutyric acid, (CH3)2C(OH)-CO2H. Uses Isobutyric acid and its volatile esters are present naturally in a wide variety of foods and, at varying concentrations, can impart a range of flavors. The compound's safety as a food additive was reviewed by an FAO and WHO panel, who concluded that there were no concerns at the likely levels of intake. Biology In humans, isobutyric acid is a minor product of the gut microbiome and can also be produced by metabolism of its esters found in food. It has a characteristic odor like rancid butter but anosmia for it has been reported in about 2.5% of people. The metabolism of isobutyric acid in plants has been studied.

Built as an experimental vessel in 1894, and easily the fastest ship in the world at that time, Turbinia was demonstrated dramatically at the Spithead Navy Review in 1897 and set the standard for the next generation of steamships, the majority of which would be turbine powered. The vessel is currently located at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, North East England, while her original powerplant is located at the Science Museum in London. Development Charles Algernon Parsons invented the modern steam turbine in 1884 and, having foreseen its potential to power ships, he set up the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company with five associates in 1893. To develop this he had the experimental vessel Turbinia built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at Wallsend on Tynehttps://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/67214.html in the Northeast of England. The Admiralty was kept informed of developments, and Turbinia was launched on 2 August 1894. Despite the success of the turbine engine, initial trials with one propeller were disappointing.http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/people/cp137567/turbinia After discovering the problem of cavitation and constructing the first cavitation tunnel, Parsons' research led to his fitting three axial-flow turbines to three shafts, each shaft in turn driving three propellers, giving a total of nine propellers. In trials this achieved a top speed of more than , so that \\"the passengers aboard would be convinced beyond all doubt Turbinia was Charles Parsons' winning North Sea greyhound\\". The turbines were directly driven, as geared turbines were not introduced until 1910. Even after the introduction of geared turbines, efficiency of even the largest axial steam turbines was still below 12 percent. Turbinia was even less efficient, with its direct drive turbine moving with a top speed of just 30 metres per second. Despite this, it was a dramatic improvement over predecessors. Demonstration 189x189px Parsons' ship turned up unannouncedTurbine - Birr Castle Demesne at the Navy Review for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Spithead, on 26 June 1897, in front of the Prince of Wales, foreign dignitaries and Lords of the Admiralty. As an audacious publicity stunt, Turbinia, which was much faster than any ship at the time, raced between the two lines of navy ships and steamed up and down in front of the crowd and princes, while easily evading a navy picket boat that tried to pursue her, almost swamping it with her wake. Photographer and cinematographer Alfred J. West took several photographs of Turbinia traveling at full speed at the Review. He was subsequently invited by Sir Charles Parsons to film and photograph the vessel within the River Tyne and the adjacent North Sea; the pictures captured remain the defining image of Turbinia at speed. A discussion of the Alfred West pictures by Ian Whitehead. Mr Whitehead was the Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums curator charged with Turbinias care in 2013. As part of the TWAMWIR residency he generated this official museum blog examining these materials. 170x170px 199x199px From this clear demonstration of her speed and power and after further high speed trials attended by the Admiralty, Parsons set up the Turbinia Works at Wallsend, which then constructed the engines for two prototype turbine-powered destroyers for the Navy, and , that were launched in 1899. Both vessels were lost to accidents in 1901, but although their losses slowed the introduction of turbines, the Admiralty had been convinced. In 1900 Turbinia steamed to Paris and was shown to French officials and then displayed at the Paris Exhibition.http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/people/cp137567/turbinia The first turbine-powered merchant vessel, the Clyde steamer , followed in 1901. The Admiralty confirmed in 1905 that all future Royal Navy vessels were to be turbine-powered, and in 1906 the first turbine-powered battleship, the revolutionary , was launched. Crosby incident On 11 January 1907, Turbinia was struck and nearly cut in two by Crosby ‚Äì a ship being launched across- river from the south bank of the Tyne. She was repaired and steamed alongside (also a turbine-powered vessel)https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/67214.html after the launch of the great ocean liner. However, mechanical problems prevented Turbinia from accompanying Mauretania down the River Tyne to the sea. As a museum ship The company decided to slow down the deterioration of Turbinia by lifting her out of the water in 1908, and in 1926 the directors of the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company offered the ship to the Science Museum, London. Turbinia was cut in two and the aft section, complete with engines and propellers, was put on display in the South Kensington museum in London, which did not have the space to accommodate the full ship. The fore section was presented in 1944 to Newcastle Corporation and placed on display in the city's Exhibition Park. In 1959, the Science Museum took the aft section of Turbinia off display and by 1961, using a reconstructed centre section, Turbinia was once more complete and on display in the Newcastle Municipal Museum of Science and Industry. In 1983 a complete reconstruction was undertaken. On 30 October 1994, 100 years after her launch, Turbinia was moved to Newcastle's Museum of Science and Engineering (later renamed The Discovery Museum) and put on display to the public in March 1996. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, in 2000, the vessel was the focal point of a year-long ¬£10.7 million redevelopment programme at the Discovery Museum. The gallery around Turbinia was the first area to be refurbished, with the main part of the work involving raising the roof by one storey to create viewing galleries on three levels.

The original version of this engine was used in the 1969 and 1970 Boss 302 Mustangs and Cougar Eliminators and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year) to a Ford small block. The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a cylinder head bolt pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified. An entirely new Boss 302 engine was introduced for the 2012 Ford Mustang using a variant of the Ford Modular engine. Design The 1969-70 302 H.O. engine was created in 1968 for the SCCA's 1969 Trans-Am road racing series. Fitted to the factory-made Boss 302 Mustangs of 1969-70, it is a unique Ford small-block featuring a thin-wall high nickel content casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, featuring 4-bolt mains, screw-in freeze plugs, higher nickel content, and cylinder heads using a canted valve design developed for the 351C, which made its debut in late 1969 Mustangs. The high nickel content block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake manifold due to the heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289 HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in 1969 they were chrome and in 1970 they were cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six valve cover bolts. The connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for bolts with a unique football- shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft is cross drilled with hollow crankshaft throws (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and of lift. The wide and large port heads with staggered valve placement give the 302 H.O. high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof design of the heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake and exhaust valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holley manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from the heat of the intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique AF 32 Autolite spark plugs specified because of their smaller size ( wrench vs. wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves. The motor produces a unique sound as a result of its solid lifter configuration. At idle, properly tuned, the engine has a great deal of 'chatter.' The power output was at 5,200 RPM with maximum torque of at 4300 RPM. It had a 6,250 RPM limit. The Boss 302 engine competes well with other high performance 'small blocks', such as the Chevy 302, the Chrysler 340, and AMC 360. The \\"Boss\\" in the Boss 302's name came from original designer Larry Shinoda's reference to Bunkie Knudsen, the CEO at Ford and an outspoken proponent of the car's development, who told his designers, \\"I want to design a car that's the coolest Mustang out there. I don't want somebody else's name on it, like a Shelby.\\" Boss 302 is the name of the car (the engine is the 302 H.O.) but it also became popular to call this specific engine the Boss 302. This engine was also optional in the Mercury Cougar Eliminator, with 169 produced in 1969 and 469 produced in 1970. New Boss 302 (2007-) The new Boss 302 engine was unveiled in the 2006 SEMA show.

The genus originated in Africa during the Pliocene, and expanded into Eurasia during the Pleistocene. One species, Palaeoloxodon namadicus, was possibly the largest known land mammal. The genus has a long and complex taxonomic history, and at various times, it has been considered to belong to Loxodonta or Elephas, but today is considered distinct. Taxonomy In 1924, circumscribed Palaeoloxodon as a subgenus of Loxodonta. It included the \\"E. antiquus‚Äînamadicus group\\", and he designated \\"E. namadicus naumanni Mak.\\" as its type species. Palaeoloxodon was later thought to be a subgenus of Elephas, but this was abandoned by 2007. In 2016, a DNA sequence analysis of P. antiquus suggested that its closest extant relative may be the African forest elephant, L. cyclotis. The paper argues that P. antiquus is closer to L. cyclotis than L. cyclotis is to the African bush elephant, L. africana, thus invalidating the genus Loxodonta as currently recognized. A second study suggested P. antiquus had a complex hybridsation history, with over 60% of its DNA coming from a lineage closest to but outside the two extant Loxodonta species, around 6% from Mammuthus and 30% from a lineage closer to L. cyclotis than L. africana. The hybridisation likely took place in Africa, where Paleoloxodon was dominant for most of the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene Some notable species are: * P. antiquus (Europe, Middle East, Asia) was larger than the modern African elephant. * P. chaniensis (Crete), dwarf elephant * P. cypriotes (Cyprus), dwarf elephant * P. falconeri (Sicily and Malta), dwarf elephant * P. mnaidriensis (Sicily), dwarf elephant * P. namadicus (Asia), the largest in its genus, and possibly the largest terrestrial mammal ever * P. naumanni (Japan), dwarf elephant and possible subspecies of E. namadicus * P. recki (East Africa), the oldest (4.0 - 0.6 million years ago) and one of the largest speciesTurner, A. (2004) Prehistoric Mammals. Larousse  Description  Palaeoloxodon namadicus, showing the parieto-occipital crest at the top of the skull typical of Palaeoloxodon. Palaeoloxodon is noted for its distinctive parieto-occipital crest present at the top of its cranium, which was used to anchor musculature to support the skull.  Evolution  Palaeoloxodon first appears in the fossil record in Africa during the early Pliocene, around 4 Mya as the species Palaeoloxodon recki. P. recki was the dominant elephant in Africa for the Pliocene and most of the Pleistocene. A population of P. recki migrated out of Africa between 0.8 and 0.6 Mya, diversifying into the radiation of Eurasian Paleoloxodon species, including P. antiquus, P. namadicus, and P. naumanni, the precise relationships of the Eurasian taxa to each other are obscure in the absence of molecular evidence. P. recki became extinct in Africa around 0.5 Mya, being replaced by the modern genus Loxodonta. The arrival of P. antiquus in Europe co-incides with the extinction of Mammuthus meridionalis and its replacement by Mammuthus trogontherii, suggesting that it might have shared a similar dietary niche and outcompeted the former. P. antiquus was able to disperse onto many islands in the Mediterranean, undergoing insular dwarfism and speciating into numerous distinct varieties of dwarf elephants. Extinction The last mainland European Palaeoloxodon faced extinction 30,000 years ago. The Japanese species possibly survived for a little longer afterwards. Among the last straight- tusked elephants were the Mediterranean dwarf species, which died out 3,000 years ago - possibly at the hands of human hunters and introduced predators. A Palaeoloxodon population of undetermined species is claimed to have survived in northern China until 3,000 years ago. Li Ji and colleagues from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Beijing, argued that teeth previously believed to belong to Asian elephants were actually those of Palaeoloxodon. Whether these belong to a new, distinctive species or actual descendants of P. namadicus is unknown. They also argued that ritual bronze vessels depicting trunks with two \\"fingers\\" must be Palaeoloxodon (which are only known from bones; their trunk characteristics are unknown) because Asian elephants only have one. Fossil elephant experts Victoria Herridge and Adrian Lister disagree with the assignment, stating that the claimed diagnostic dental features are actually contrast artifacts created due to the low image resolution of the figures in the scientific paper, which are not evident in better-quality photographs. Given that the appearance of Palaeoloxodon trunks is unknown, and the bronze depictions of animals shown in the paper are highly stylized, the argument based on bronze vessels is also unreliable. Thus, these elephants are more likely Asian elephants, as originally believed.

It is widely used in behavioral neuroscience to study spatial learning and memory. It enables learning, memory, and spatial working to be studied with great accuracy, and can also be used to assess damage to particular cortical regions of the brain. It is used by neuroscientists to measure the effect of neurocognitive disorders on spatial learning and possible neural treatments, to test the effect of lesions to the brain in areas concerned with memory, and to study how age influences cognitive function and spatial learning. The task is also used as a tool to study drug- abuse, neural systems, neurotransmitters, and brain development.  Overview  The basic procedure for the Morris water navigation task is that the rat is placed in a large circular pool and is required to find an invisible or visible platform that allows it to escape the water by using various cues. Many factors can influence the rats' performance, including their sex, the environment in which they were raised, exposure to drugs, etc. There are three basic tactics for the rats to escape the maze: a praxic strategy (remembering the movements needed to get to the platform), a taxic strategy (the rat uses visual cues to reach their destinations), or spatial strategy (using distal cues as points of reference to locate themselves). There are a variety of paradigms for the water maze that can be used to examine different cognitive functions. In particular, cognitive flexibility can be assessed using a water maze paradigm in which the hidden platform is continually re-located.  History  The Morris water navigation task was conceived by Richard G. Morris (then at the University of St Andrews) in 1981 as an alternative to the radial maze. The test was developed to study spatial learning and how it differed from other forms of associative learning. Originally rats, now more commonly mice, were placed in an open pool and the latency to escape was measured for up to six trials a day for 2‚Äì14 days. Several variables are used to evaluate an animal's performance. For example, a \\"probe trial\\" measures how long the test subject spends in the \\"target quadrant\\" (the quadrant with the hidden platform). More elaborate trials alter the location of the hidden platform, or measure distance spent swimming in the pool before reaching the platform. Over the years, many different versions of this test have been performed with a large amount of variables. For example, neuroscientists examine the effect of differences of sex, weight, strength, stress levels, age, and strain of species. The results vary dramatically, so researchers cannot draw conclusions unless these variables are kept constant. Many different size pools have been used throughout the history of this task, but it has been shown that this does not have a significant impact on the results of the test. In early versions of the task, researchers only timed latency to escape, however video tracking devices are now routinely used to measure the path to escape, time spent in each quadrant, and distance traveled in the pool. = Original experiment = In Morris' first experiment, the apparatus was a large circular pool, 1.30 m across and 0.60 m high. The purpose of the original experiment was to show that spatial learning does not require the presence of local cues, meaning that rats can learn to locate an object without any auditory, visual, or olfactory cues.  Analysis  The earliest measure of learning is escape latency, which is the time it takes to find the platform. However, this measure is confounded by swimming speed, not necessarily a cognitive factor, and path length between point of origin and platform is a parameter more closely related to spatial learning. Further parameters are the Gallagher measure, the average distance to the platform, and the Whishaw corridor test, which measures time and path in a strip directly leading from swim-start to platform. Other parameters are measured during probe trials: the escape platform is removed and the mice or rats are allowed to search for it for a fixed time (often 60 seconds). Variables measured are time and path length in quadrants, time near platform, and platform crossings.  Comparison to maze tasks  Like other spatial tasks, such as the T-maze and radial arm maze, the Morris water navigation task is supposed to measure spatial memory, movement control, and cognitive mapping. The T-maze and radial arm maze are much more structured in comparison. The T-maze, for instance, only requires the rat or mouse to make a binary decision, choose left or right (or East or West). In the Morris water navigation task, on the other hand, the animal needs to decide continually where to go. Another reason this task became popular is that rats (but not mice) are natural swimmers, but dislike colder water (mice simply dislike water of any temperature), so in order to perform the task they do not need to be motivated by food deprivation or electrical shock. The mobility of the platform allows for experiments on learning and relearning. Also, the apparatus set-up and costs are relatively low.  Weaknesses  When the searching times for the platform in the target quadrant are reduced in the probe trial, this is seen as direct evidence that the spatial memory of the mouse must be impaired. However, many times the reason for a lengthier amount of time spent looking for the platform, or the lack of searching in the target quadrant, has nothing to do with an effect on the mouse's spatial memory, but is actually due to other factors. A large study of performance in mice concluded that almost half of all variance in performance scores was due to differences in thigmotaxis, the tendency of animals to stay close to the walls of the pool. About 20% of the variability was explained by differing tendencies of mice to float passively in the water until \\"rescued\\" by the experimenter. Differences in spatial memory were only the third factor, explaining just 13% of the variation between animals' performance.

It is served by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. The 2016 population estimate for Bellevue's two main zip codes was 77,862. In the 1950s, Bellevue was a small community which existed primarily to serve the needs of nearby farms. It was mostly along the railroad tracks near the Harpeth River, and had only a few buildings such as a hardware store, post office, and a Masonic lodge hall. The suburbanization was made official when the United States Postal Service changed the office's designation from \\"Bellview, Tennessee\\" to a branch of the Nashville office in the late 1970s. Since the year 2000, Bellevue has grown in population and development in the established areas along Old Hickory Boulevard, Sawyer Brown Road, McCrory Lane, and Tennessee State Highway 100. Three commercial retail hotspots in the Bellevue area are near the Highway 70S/I-40 interchange, at the intersection of Highway 70S and Old Hickory Boulevard; and near the intersection of Old Harding Pike and Highway 100. Bellevue is a popular destination for nature lovers because of several attractions such as the massive Warner Parks that feature miles of paved and unpaved trails for hikers and cyclists, the Harpeth River Greenway, as well as the beginning access point for the multi-state recreational highway known as the Natchez Trace Parkway. Bellevue is the home to the redeveloping property One Bellevue Place on the property formerly known as Bellevue Center Mall. Purchased by Bellevue Development, LLC on December 10, 2007, mortgage financing was secured to redevelop the site into a retail lifestyle center. Demolition of the old building was completed in early 2016. Following months of grading, construction began in late summer of 2016. Completion is anticipated in November 2017 and the property will hold a wide-ranging mix of retail, office buildings, a 120-room Hilton Home2Suites hotel, and 330 apartments. One Bellevue Place is home to a Sprouts Farmer's Market grocery store, as well as an AMC movie theater.http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/davidson%20/2015/07/30/bellevue- mall-memories-one-bellevue-place-reaction/30426525/ The property was formerly owned by Inland Western Real Estate Trust. On May 2, 2010, the Bellevue area was hard-hit by a devastating flood, but it has rebounded and is experiencing a transformative trajectory in residential and commercial development. Demographics According to the census of 2000, there were 37,062 people and 14,807 households in Bellevue. There were an average of 2.5 persons per household. In 1990, 76% of people aged 25 or older had a high school education or better. The median income was $40,328. As of 2016 the population had risen to 77,862. Bellevue Public Library Bellevue's first library service was via bookmobile during World War II. The Bellevue Public Library opened in 1984 in the old woodshop/agriculture classroom building of the original Bellevue High School, built in 1931 and torn down in 1971 when the new Bellevue High School was built on the other side of Colice Jeanne Road. The former gymnasium at the back of the school became the Bellevue Community Center. Both the woodshop/agriculture building and the gymnasium were added in the 1950s. The new Bellevue Branch Library opened in January, 2015. The new Bellevue Branch features a children's area, teen area, computer space, caf√© style coffee and vending area as well as meeting room space. Bellevue Park The red caboose of Bellevue Park. Bellevue Park is located on Colice Jeanne Road in Bellevue across from Bellevue Middle School and next to the Bellevue Branch Library. It is part of the Metro Nashville Parks System. The park is called Red Caboose Park due to the red caboose that sits on site. The park also has a log cabin (which was built by the town's founder, Abraham Louis Demoss, prior to 1800, and moved to the park from its original location a couple of miles away in about 2005) onsite. The park features an exercise path for walkers and joggers, as well as a playground built by community volunteers in 1996 as part of the Bellevue Bicentennial Celebration. Red Caboose Park is the site of the annual Bellevue Community Picnic, which attracts around 20,000 people each year.

Mo√´t et Chandon is one of the world's largest champagne producers and a prominent champagne house. Mo√´t et Chandon was established in 1743 by Claude Mo√´t, and today owns of vineyards, and annually produces approximately 28,000,000 bottles of champagne. History Mo√´t et Chandon began as Mo√´t et Cie (meaning \\"Mo√´t & Co.\\"), established by √âpernay wine trader Claude Mo√´t in 1743, and began shipping his wine from Champagne to Paris. The reign of King Louis XV coincided with increased demand for sparkling wine. Soon after its foundation, and after son Claude-Louis joined Mo√´t et Cie, the winery's clientele included nobles and aristocrats. In 1833, the company was renamed Mo√´t et Chandon after Pierre-Gabriel Chandon de Briailles, Remy Mo√´t's son-in-law, joined the company as a partner of Jean- Remy Mo√´t, Claude Mo√´t's grandson. Following the introduction of the concept of a vintage champagne in 1840, Mo√´t marketed its first vintage in 1842. Their best-selling brand, Brut Imperial, was introduced in the 1860s. Their best known label, Dom Perignon, is named for the Benedictine monk remembered in legend as the \\"Father of Champagne\\". Mo√´t & Chandon merged with Hennessy Cognac in 1971 and with Louis Vuitton in 1987 to become LVMH (Louis-Vuitton- Mo√´t-Hennessy), the largest luxury group in the world, netting over 16 billion euros in fiscal 2004. Mo√´t & Chandon holds a royal warrant as supplier of champagne to Queen Elizabeth II.The Royal Warrant Holders Association In 2006, Mo√´t et Chandon Brut Imp√©rial issued an extremely limited bottling of its champagne named \\"Be Fabulous\\", a special release of its original bottle with decorative Swarovski crystals, marking the elegance of Mo√´t et Chandon. Dom Perignon Dom P√©rignon (; ) is a brand of champagne produced by Mo√´t & Chandon. It is named after Dom Pierre P√©rignon, a Benedictine monk who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the champagne method for making sparkling wines.D. & P.

It is a vintage champagne, meaning that it is only made in the best years, and all grapes used to make the wine are harvested in the same year. Many champagnes, by contrast, are non-vintage, meaning that the champagne is made from grapes harvested in various years.

Country Life, 28 March 2017 Domaine Chandon In 1973, the then Mo√´t-Hennessy company founded Domaine Chandon, an outpost winery in the Napa Valley. It was the first French-owned sparkling wine venture in the United States. The fine dining restaurant √©toile was situated at the winery, closing in December 2014. Chandon had already founded an outpost in Argentina in 1959, and was doing the same in the southern city of Garibaldi in Brasil in 1973. Domaine Chandon was later established in 1986 in Australia in Coldstream, Victoria, in the Ningxia region in China in 2013 and India's Nashik region in 2014.

Whereas Mississippian and Pennsylvania Age rock layers are deep beneath the soil surface in central Illinois, these strata pierce the surface in southern Illinois. The Shawnee Hills are surface expressions of the more weather- resistant limestone and sandstone layers. This formation is due in part to the last glaciation of the Ice Age (which tended to grind down hills and bury them under soil) not reaching this far south. Shawnee is the name used for a native American people, who historically resided in the Ohio Valley. The Shawnee Hills are often called the \\"Illinois Ozarks\\", especially in promotional literature for tourism. But they are technically not a part of The Ozarks, a geologically similar area that for the most part begins just to the west across the Mississippi River floodplain in southeastern Missouri. Within the Shawnee Hills, limestone is extensively quarried from outcrops, while both north and south of the Shawnee Hills, coal is mined by surface techniques on shallow coal seams near the edges of the Illinois Basin and by deep mining techniques in the deeper parts of the Basin. Additionally, extensive faulting in and around the Shawnee Hills occurred due to deep tectonic activities and formed sites for deposition of fluorite, a mineral used for production of the element fluorine. At one time, about 80% of the world's fluorspar ore was mined near the towns of Rosiclare and Cave in Rock. A large portion of the Shawnee Hills lies within the Shawnee National Forest.http://www.fs.usda.gov/shawnee The beauty of the Shawnee Hills, the Shawnee National Forest, and the Ohio River Valley make the area a prime tourist destination. The Shawnee Hills can be seen faintly from as far north as Vergennes. The westernmost portion of the hills rise south of Murphysboro and continue southward to Olive Branch. Large plains used for farmland separate the hills from the Mississippi River along Illinois Route 3, especially near the towns of Wolf Lake, Grand Tower and Ware. The Big Muddy River cuts through the hills south of Kinkaid Lake, making rocky cliffs that can be viewed by boat-ride down the river.

It's one of the national dishes of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Southern Colombia and Argentina.  Composition  The dish is a classic squash, corn, beans, and potato or pumpkin soup well known along the South American Andes. In some regions locro is made using a specific kind of potato called \\"papa chola\\", which has a unique taste and is difficult to find outside of its home region. The defining ingredients are squash, corn, some form of meat (usually beef, but sometimes beef jerky or chorizo), and vegetables. Other ingredients vary widely, and typically include onion, beans, squash or pumpkin. It is mainly eaten in winter. In Argentina it spread from the back to the front Cuyo region to the rest of the country. It is considered a national dish and is often served on May 25, the anniversary of the May Revolution. A red hot sauce made from red peppers and paprika known as Quiquirimichi is served sometimes on the side. In Ecuador, a variant known as yahuarlocro is popular. It incorporates lamb entrails and lamb blood to the recipe.  Gallery  File:LocroSantiagueno.jpgLocro at the table, with quiquirimichi and bread.

One has a vested right to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset. When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a vested interest. The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are inheritance law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else's property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one's right to an easement becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing. Inheritance Some bequests do not vest immediately upon death of the testator. For example, many wills specify that an heir who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty. It is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the remainder to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be contingent. This may happen with entailed estates, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See trust law for details). Employment =Retirement plans= Vesting is an issue in conjunction with employer contributions to an employee stock option plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a 401(k), annuity or pension plan. A vested right is \\"an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account\\".Lectric Law Dictionary It is a \\"basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away\\"; for example. one has a right to a vested pension.Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 577 (1991). Generally, the portion vested cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined pro-rata. Generally, for retirement plans in the United States, employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception. For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as cliff vesting. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as graduated vesting. Choosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward. =Ownership in startup companies= Small entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of common stock or positions in an employee stock option plan to employees and other key participants such as contractors, board members, advisors and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements. Vesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule. Common stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different. An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a repurchase right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested). Beginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3‚Äì5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a pro-rata monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting. In the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee. = Profit sharing plans = Profit-sharing plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.  Vested rights doctrine in zoning law  The vested rights doctrine is the rule of zoning law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a building permit or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.  Vesting arrangements and terminology A \\"vesting period\\" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away. In many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting. When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered \\"partly vested\\". In cases of partial vesting, a \\"vesting schedule\\" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period. Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once. Some arrangements provide for \\"accelerated vesting\\", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. \\"Graded vesting\\" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be \\"uniform\\" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or \\"non-uniform\\" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).Graded Vesting See also * Doctrine of worthier title * Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) * Future interest * Pro-rata * Remainder (law) * Vested Property Act (Bangladesh) References External links * TIAA CREF discussion of vesting Category:Labour law Category:Property law Category:Inheritance Category:Wills and trusts ","title":"Vesting"},{"id":"859073","title":"List of lakes of Finland"},{"id":"859074","title":"Hawaii's 2nd congressional district"},{"id":"859076","title":"Lehigh Valley Railroad"},{"id":"859077","text":"Beige is the French word for the color of natural wool.

Beige is variously described as a pale sandy fawn color,Oxford English Dictionary a grayish tan,Webster's New World Dictionary of the English Language, 1964 a light-grayish yellowish brown, or a pale to grayish yellow.Macmillan On-Line Dictionary. It takes its name from French, where the word originally meant natural wool that has been neither bleached nor dyed, hence also the color of natural wool.Le Petit Robert Dictionnaire. It has come to be used to describe a variety of light tints chosen for their neutral or pale warm appearance. Beige was used as a color term in France beginning approximately 1855‚Äì60; the writer Edmond de Goncourt used it in the novel La Fille Elisa in 1877.

The engine is well known and named for its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. It was introduced in 1954 as a more modern replacement for the outdated side-valved Ford Flathead V8 ' was used in a variety of Ford vehicles through 1964. By 1948, the famous Ford Flathead V8 had been developed about as far as it could go, and it was antiquated by the early 1950s. Ford was the most conservative of the major automakers, holding onto older designs longer than GM or Chrysler, but market forces pushed Ford to develop new designs in the 1950s. Management at Ford Motor Company instructed its engineers to develop a new engine for the future. By 1952 Ford had new OHV 6-cylinder engine (215 in¬≥ I-6) and Lincoln had a 317 in¬≥ OHV V8. The company had designed the Y-block for a 1953 introduction, but a shortage of nickel due to the Korean War's needs prevented the company from manufacturing the engine in sufficient quantities. It therefore wasn‚Äôt until 1954 that Ford introduced its new Ford Y-Block V8. In 1954 the Y-block displaced 239 in¬≥ (3,910 cc), the same displacement as the old Ford Flathead V8 but with a bigger bore and a shorter stroke. It produced 130 bhp as opposed to the Flathead's final 110 bhp, an increase of 18%. The Mercury Y-Block was 256 in¬≥ (4,194 cc) and produced 161 bhp, again a similar displacement to the 255 in¬≥ Mercury Flathead V8 it replaced, but with 29% more power than the older engine's 125 bhp. The original Lincoln V8 was also known as a Y-Block. Lincoln introduced their engine in 1952, but it was a different design from the Ford Y-Block, and was used on large cars and Ford heavy-duty trucks. One of the design qualities of the Y-Block V8 is its deep skirting which makes for a very rigid block for added strength in the bottom end. The drawback to this is it also makes for a heavy cylinder block. This being Ford‚Äôs first OHV engine, they had to feed oil to the rocker arm shafts through a passage from the center cam bearing. Because of the low detergents in oils of that era these passages would often become clogged giving the Y-Block a reputation for bad oiling to the top end. Ford came up with a stop gap measure for this problem by feeding oil via an external tube directly to the rocker shafts from the main oil gallery. Because of better oils today and a grooved center cam journal, a clean freshly rebuilt Y-Block should no longer have this problem and thus, no need for the external oiling tube. Cylinder heads on the Y-Block have always been a point for discussion. Because of the configuration of the intake ports, vertically in pairs instead of horizontally side by side, and the way in which they make sharp turns around the head bolts, they have been called ‚Äúbad breathers‚Äù. Although their flow can indeed be inferior, they are nonetheless able to rev to 7,000+ rpm. Ford Y-blocks are easily identified. The distributor is located at the back of the engine and off to one side and the valve covers are held on with two bolts through the top. 239 The first Y-block on Ford automobiles was the 239 in¬≥ (3,910 cc) version as released in 1954. The Y-block was the same displacement as the old Ford Flathead V8 that it replaced but with a bigger bore and a shorter stroke (3.5 x 3.1 in). It produced 130 bhp (97 kW) at 4,200 rpm as opposed to the flathead's final 110 bhp (82 kW) at 3,800 rpm, an increase of 18%. Torque was also up compared to the Flathead, with 214 lb¬∑ft (290 N¬∑m) at 1,800rpm compared with 196 lb¬∑ft (266 N¬∑m) at 2,000rpm. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. The 239 in¬≥ version was only available in 1954 models and was replaced by its bigger 272 in¬≥ and 292 in¬≥ siblings in 1955. 256 The original Mercury Y-block, introduced for the 1954 model year, displaced 256 in¬≥ (4,194 cc). Advertised as the \\"V-161\\" engine, it ran a bore and stroke of 3.625 x 3.1 in. The compression ratio was 7.5:1, and the rated power was at 4,400 rpm. Torque was at 2,200 rpm. The engine breathed through a Holley model 2140 (4V) carburetor. The 256 in¬≥ version of the Mercury Y-block was only available in 1954 models and was replaced by the 292 in¬≥ in 1955. 272 By 1955 Chevrolet introduced its ‚Äúsmall block V8‚Äù with 265 in¬≥, not to be outdone Ford increased its displacement to 272 in¬≥ and introduced the Thunderbird with a 292 in¬≥ engine. The 272 in¬≥ (4,465 cc) version of the Y-Block was the same bore as the outgoing Mercury 256 in¬≥ Y-Block but with a longer stroke (3.625 x 3.3 in). The standard 1955 U-code featured a two barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at 162 bhp (121 kW) at 4,400 rpm and 258 lb¬∑ft (350 Nm) at 2,400 rpm. The optional \\"Power Pack\\" M-code utilised a four barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at 182 bhp (136 kW) at 4,400 rpm. In 1956 the U-code was updated to produce 173 bhp (129 kW) at 4,400 rpm and 260 lb¬∑ft (353 N¬∑m) at 2,400 rpm with a manual transmission behind it or 176 bhp (131 kW) at 4,400 rpm and 264 lb¬∑ft (358 N¬∑m) at 2,400 rpm with an automatic transmission. The M-code 272 was dropped altogether in 1956 in favour of a four barrel M-code version of the 292. A final version of the 272 in the US was released in 1957 as the B-code. It featured a two barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at 190 bhp (142 kW) at 4,500 rpm and 270 lb¬∑ft (366 N¬∑m) at 2,700 rpm. Ford Australia released this V8 motor as its only option in the four-door Customline sedan from 1955-1959 (based on the Canadian Mercury), and its coup√© utility, based on the same styling as the Customline, called a Mainline. It was introduced in passenger cars in July 1955, and in the redesigned truck lineup one month later. In late 1956 the Australian 272 switched to a four barrel Autolite carburetor. This engine, as well as the 292 version starting in 1956, was also produced by Ford of Brazil at its S√£o Paulo plant facility (Ipiranga plant). A new building was opened on November 21, 1958, by the Brazilian President, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira, to produce the first Ford engine in South America. The 272 version was used on Brazilian F-series trucks until 1977 and on the Brazilian Galaxie 500, launched in April 1967. 292 A 292 Y-block engine in a 1955 Ford Crown Victoria SkylinerThe 292 in¬≥ (4,778 cc) Y-Block was also introduced in 1955. The 292 shared the 3.3 in (83.82 mm) stroke of the 272 but with a larger 3.75 in (95.25 mm) bore. It was used in the Ford Thunderbird, 1959-60 Edsel, Mercury, and some high-end Ford cars. The Ford version was the P-code \\"Thunderbird V8\\", which for cars equipped with a manual transmission had a compression ratio of 8.1:1 and was rated at 193 bhp (144 kW) at 4,400 rpm and with 280 lb¬∑ft (380 Nm) at 2,600 rpm. Cars equipped with an automatic transmission had a slightly higher compression ratio of 8.5:1 with a quoted 198 bhp (148 kW) at 4,400 rpm and 286 lb¬∑ft (388 Nm) at 2,500 rpm. The Mercury division had two versions of the 292 available in 1955. The standard engine had a 7.6:1 compression ratio and was rated at 188 bhp (140 kW) at 4,400 rpm, with 272 lb¬∑ft (369 Nm) of torque at 2,500 rpm. The top of the range Montclair V8 came with a higher specification version that was rated 198 bhp (148 kW) at 4,400 rpm and 282 lb¬∑ft (382 Nm) at 2,500 rpm. 1955 would be the only model year that Mercury would utilise the 292 in version of the Y-Block, with it being replaced by the larger 312 in engine for the 1956 model year. In 1956 Ford replaced the P-code 292 with a new 312 in¬≥ \\"Thunderbird Special V8\\" version of the Y-Block, while the M-code 272 was replaced with a new M-Code specification of the 292. This M-code \\"Thunderbird V8\\" 292 was now optional on all Fords. The engine when fitted behind manual transmission vehicles had an 8.0:1 compression ratio and was rated at 200 bhp (149 kW) at 4,600 rpm and 285 lb¬∑ft at 2,600 rpm, whilst the automatic featured an 8.4:1 compression ratio with a rating of 202 bhp (151 kW) at 4,600 rpm and 289 lb¬∑ft (392 Nm) at 2,600 rpm. All Ford Y-Blocks were up on power for the 1957 model year. The 292 was available as the C-code engine option, once again with a slight difference between the manual transmission and \\"Fordomatic\\" automatic transmission. Compression was up to 9.1:1 in manual cars, which were rated 206 bhp (154 kW) at 4,500 rpm and 297 lb¬∑ft (403 Nm) at 2,700 rpm. Automatic vehicles were rated 212 bhp (158 kW) at 4,500 rpm, torque and compression ratio are not listed in the Ford 1957 workshop manual as being any different to the manual car, which seems unlikely given the power difference at the same engine speed. The 292 would be the longest-lived of the Y-Blocks, carrying on until 1962 in U.S. cars and until 1964 in U.S. trucks. It was also used in Argentina in the F-100 pick-up well into the 1960s, and was known as Fase I (Phase I). In 1971, the engine was modified to accept a new-style cylinder head with a different valve arrangement (E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I versus E-I-I-E-E-I- I-E), new intake and exhaust manifolds and was renamed Fase II (Phase II). In this form, the 292 Fase II continued into the 1980s in the F-100, and was also used in the Argentine Ford Fairlane (built from 1969‚Äì1982, and based heavily on the U.S. 1968 model). All Argentine versions of this engine feature a cast crankshaft rather than the forged example that equipped US heavy-duty engines. The 292 version was also produced by Ford of Brazil and equipped the Brazilian LTD starting in 1969. Both the 272 and 292 engines were replaced on Brazilian cars by the 302 engine starting on 1976 model year. 312 The V8 engine came out for the 1956 model year and was again used in high-end Ford and Mercury cars, including the Thunderbird. Bore x stroke dimensions were . Depending on model year and application, the 312 was available with a single two- or four- barrel Holley carburetor, two four-barrel carburetors and with or without a McCulloch (Paxton) supercharger (1957 only). All 1956 U.S. Mercury models were powered by the V8 breathing through a four-barrel carburetor. At the beginning of the model year, a version with 8.0:1 compression ratio powered Mercury cars with manual transmissions (including three-speed plus overdrive), while a version powered cars with automatic transmissions. The 225-horsepower version had an 8.4:1 compression ratio. Later in the model year, a version with 9.0:1 compression ratio became available. All 1956 Mercury engines had gold-painted blocks and heads. The 210-horsepower version had red valve covers and air cleaner, while the 225-horsepower version had blue valve covers and air cleaner. The 235-horsepower version had argent silver valve covers and air cleaner. A dealer-installed \\"M 260\\" engine kit was released in January 1956. The kit consisted of a hotter camshaft, revised cylinder heads, and an intake manifold mounting two four-barrel carburetors. The kit was advertised as boosting the Mercury 312 V8 to . Not generally known, about 40% of these 312s were equipped with vacuum secondary CARTER WCFBs. They are a highly desired version, as the Holley \\"teapots\\" were cantankerous. The 312s had no centrifugal timing advance in their distributors until 1957. Acceleration, response and gas mileage can be greatly increased by installing a year model later distributor. The last regular application of the 312 V8 in the U.S. was for certain 1960 Mercury models. Though considered to be a high-performance engine in 1956 and 1957, it was downgraded to an \\"economy\\" engine with low compression and two-barrel carburetor by 1960. Ford pickups used the version as late as 1965. Replacement When Ford Y-block debuted its power making ability was already hindered by its inherent displacement limit. A quick reference to the engine specifications for 1955-57 shows the Ford V8s ahead of the Chevrolet counterparts in displacement, horsepower, and torque. However, larger CID V8 engines made by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, Pontiac and Oldsmobile clearly showed the small CID architecture of the Y-block would need revision in order to keep pace with the other automakers. Even with the benefit of today's technology (aftermarket rods and stroker cranks), the upper limit of a Y-block is about , while the Chevrolet could be modified well past the factory limit of . The result was the introduction in 1958 of the 332 CID \\"big block\\" Ford FE engine which ultimately grew to 428 in¬≥ - Later, in 1962, the Ford Windsor engine - which began at would fully replace the Y-Block and grow to .

Miller used the name \\"Joseph K. Mertz\\" for his publication of three previously unpublished manuscripts of Mertz in Three Compositions For Guitar. He was active in Vienna (c.1840‚Äì1856), which had been home to various prominent figures of the guitar, including Anton Diabelli, Mauro Giuliani, Wenceslaus Matiegka and Simon Molitor. As virtuoso, he established a solid reputation as a performer. He toured Moravia, Poland, and Russia, and gave performances in Berlin and Dresden. In 1846 Mertz nearly died of an overdose of strychnine that had been prescribed to him as a treatment for neuralgia. Over the following year he was nursed back to health in the presence of his wife, the concert pianist Josephine Plantin whom he married in 1842. Some speculation may lead one to the conclusion that listening to his wife performing the romantic piano pieces of the day during his period of recovery may have had an influence on the sound and unusual right hand technique he adopted for the Bardenkl√§nge (Bardic Sounds) op. 13 (1847). Mertz's guitar music, unlike that of most of his contemporaries, followed the pianistic models of Liszt, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann, rather than the classical models of Mozart and Haydn (as did Sor and Aguado), or the bel canto style of Rossini (as did Giuliani). Though the date of his birth indicates that that was the logical influence, since Sor was born in 1778, Aguado in 1784 and Giuliani in 1781 while Mertz in 1806, a difference of about 25 years. The Bardenkl√§nge are probably Mertz's most important contribution to the guitar repertoire (a series of character pieces in the mould of Schumann), together with the great fantasias La rimembranza, Pens√©e fugitive and Harmonie du soir, considered a trilogyFor the first time recorded as trilogy by Giuseppe Chiaramonte, Mertz: Fantasias for solo guitar, Label: Brilliant Classics, 2019, the most technically demanding pieces written by Mertz, clearly inspired by Liszt's piano music. Cover of Altmeister der Gitarre: Johann Kaspar Mertz. The portrait of J. K. Mertz first appeared on the cover of Erwin Schwarz-Reiflingen's 1920 book Altmeister der Gitarre: Johann Kaspar Mertz. There was no attribution for the source, but in Schwarz-Reiflingen's commentary he mentions the duo 'Fantasie aus der oper \\"Elisier d'amour' came as a previously unpublished manuscript from Edward Bayer, Jr., son of the well-known guitarist Edward Bayer. It is possible, yet unconfirmed, that the portrait could also have come from the estate of Edward Bayer. The grayscale reproductions of the portrait have all come from a photo the Japanese guitar collector Jiro Nakano took in the 1970s from a copy of Altmeister der Gitarre: Johann Kaspar Mertz in the collection of Morishige Takei. It was provided to Astrid Stempnik for her dissertation by Masami Kimura. Originals of this book are only known to exist in the Takei Collection (at the Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo, Japan), Bickford Collection (at California State University, Northridge) and The Danish Music Museum.

Forbidden knowledge is commonly not secret, rather a society or various institutions will use repressive mechanisms to either completely prevent the publication of information they find objectionable or dangerous (censorship), or failing that, to try to reduce the public's trust in such information (propaganda). Public repression can create paradoxical situation where the proscribed information is generally common knowledge but publicly citing it is disallowed. A rich set of examples exist through history. * The Roman Catholic church forbids publication of books to which it has not granted Imprimatur.Word of the Day: imprimaturCode of Canon Law, canon 830 ¬ß3 *Throughout the years of isolation in Japan and China all Western literature was forbidden. *Certain 20th century regimes (e.g. communist nations in Eastern Europe and China) placed strong restrictions on foreign publications. * In the United States, conservative groups including Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority made several attempts to censor pro civil-rights and feminist works such as Our Bodies, Ourselves. In many cases this resulted in people defending themselves by creating political jokes. Jokes throughout history have been a powerful instrument to undermine state authority and the public truth associated with it. Sociological and political relevance Some form of public repression of facts or speculation not desirable to some people or even a majority of the population seems inevitable as societies need to create some common basis of facts to create a unified identity. Critical to political and personal freedom is the level to which this repression is organized through the state or powerful private organizations. Western secular societies have reached the consensus through the late 19th and early 20th centuries that private organizations should not be allowed to engage in compulsory censorship, forcing people to obey their dictates. For example, the separation of church and state in most Western societies mostly prevents religious organizations from repressing individuals based on their personal opinions and beliefs. As well, people are generally allowed to leave employment with a company which may regulate such personal expressions for whatever reason and find employment in less restrictive circumstances.

He has been recognized as one of the most significant figures of 19th-century Wales, and one of the most unusual in Victorian Britain.Powell 2005. p. 3.Hutton 2009. p. 253. Born to a lower-class household in Glamorganshire, Wales, Price trained as a doctor in London before returning to Wales, becoming interested in the Chartists' ideas regarding equal democratic rights for all men. Following their failed 1839 uprising, he escaped government prosecution by fleeing to France, where he became convinced that an ancient prophecy predicted that he would remove Wales from English rule. Returning to Wales, Price tried reviving what he believed to be the religion of the ancient druids, the Celtic Iron Age ritual specialists of western Europe. In doing so, he became one of the most prominent proponents of the Neo-Druidic movement, something that had been developing since the Welsh nationalist Iolo Morganwg's activities in the late 18th century. After cremating his dead son in 1884, Price was arrested and put on trial by those who believed cremation was illegal in Britain; however, he successfully argued that there was no legislation that specifically outlawed it, which paved the way for the Cremation Act 1902. Upon his death, he was cremated in a ceremony watched by 20,000 onlookers. Known for adhering to such principles as equal democratic rights for all men, vegetarianism, cremation and the abolition of marriage, some of which were highly controversial at the time, he has been widely known as an \\"eccentric\\" and a \\"radical\\".BBC Welsh hall of fame Since his death he has been remembered by some people as \\"one of the great Welshmen of all time\\". A permanent exhibition and statue dedicated to him being was opened by these people in the town of Llantrisant, where he had lived for much of his later life.Hutton 2009. p. 286.  Biography  = Early life: 1800‚Äì1821 = Price in 1822, whilst at medical school William Price was born in a cottage at the farm Ty'n-y-coedcae (\\"the smallholding of the hedged field, tyddyn + y + coetgae\\") near Rudry near Caerphilly in Glamorganshire on 4 March 1800. His father, also named William Price (1761‚Äì), was an ordained priest of the Church of England who had studied at Jesus College, Oxford. His mother, Mary Edmunds (1767‚Äì1844), was an uneducated Welshwoman who had been a maidservant prior to her marriage. Their marital union was controversial because Mary was of a lower social standing than William, something which was socially taboo in late 18th century British society. The couple had three other surviving children, Elisabeth (1793‚Äì1872), Mary (1797‚Äì1869) and Ann (1804‚Äì1878). The elder Price suffered from an undiagnosed mental illness, acting erratically and experiencing fits of violent rage. He bathed either fully clothed or naked in local ponds, and collected snakes in his pockets for days at a time. Carrying a saw around, he removed bark from trees, then burned it while muttering certain words, also spitting onto stones, believing that it improved their value. His actions led to him becoming a threat to the local community, in one instance firing a gun at a woman whom he claimed was taking sticks from his hedgerow, and in another hurling a sharp implement at another man. At home, Welsh was William's primary language, but he learned to speak English at school, which was located two miles from his home, in Machen. Although only staying at school for three years, between the ages of 10 and 13, he passed most exams and proved himself a successful student. After spending six months living at home, he decided to become a doctor despite his father's insistence that he become a solicitor. Moving to Caerphilly, in 1814 he became apprenticed to successful surgeon Evan Edwards, and paid for his tuition with money supplied by various family members. One of these benefactors, his uncle the Reverend Thomas Price of Merriott, Somerset, advised him to give up this education, arguing that it was putting too great a financial strain upon Price's family, but William was insistent that he should continue. In 1820, Price's apprenticeship with Edwards came to an end, and despite his lack of funds, he moved to London in order to continue his studies. Taking up lodgings near to St Paul's Cathedral, he entered The London Hospital in Whitechapel for a year of instruction under Sir William Blizard. He also registered at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he was under the instruction of surgeon John Abernethy. Gaining employment caring for wealthy clients to help financially support his studies, Price eventually became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, being awarded with a certificate signed by Blizard, Abernathy and others. Contemplating travelling to India following the culmination of his studies in London, he instead decided to return to Wales, where he worked as a general practitioner. = Welsh nationalism and Chartism: 1821‚Äì1839 = Becoming a trained doctor, Price returned to Wales, setting up in his medical practice at Craig yr Helfa in Glyntaff, remaining there for seven years. He rented Porth y Glo Farm in Upper Boat, filling the farm with goats and cattle, but was forcibly evicted. He subsequently moved to the newly industrialised Taff Valley near to Pontypridd. It was here in 1823 that the workforce elected him to the position of chief surgeon at the Brown Lenox Chainworks in Pontypridd; he stayed in this job till 1871. In June 1823 he was also appointed medical advisor to the wealthy Crawshay family who owned the ironworks at Merthyr and Treforest. Spending time in Treforest, \\"a revolutionary town\\", he came under the increasing influence of left-wing political ideas. Being a proud Welsh nationalist, Price found likeminded friends in another wealthy family, the Guests, and gave a speech on Welsh history and literature at their Royal Eisteddfod in 1834, which Lady Charlotte Guest felt to be \\"one of the most beautiful and eloquent speeches that was ever heard\\". On the basis of it, he was invited to take up the job of judging the eisteddfod's bardic competition, with the prize being awarded to Taliesin, son of famous druid and Welsh nationalist Iolo Morganwg. An illustration of a Chartist riot. Price became increasingly interested in Welsh cultural activities, which included those that had been influenced by the Neo-Druidic movement. He joined the Society of the Rocking Stone, a Neo- Druidic group that met at the Y Maen Chwyf stone circle in Pontypridd, and by 1837 had become one of its leading members. To encourage the revival of Welsh culture, he gave lessons every Sunday in the Welsh language, which he feared was dying out with the spread of English. In 1838 he also called for the Society to raise funds to build a Druidical Museum in the town, the receipts from which would be used to run a free school for the poor. He was supported in this venture by Francis Crawshay, a member of the Crawshay family, but did not gain enough sponsors to allow the project to go ahead. In anger, he issued a statement in a local newspaper, telling the people that they were ignoring \\"your immortal progenitors, to whom you owe your very existence as a civilised people.\\" Meanwhile, Price's social conscience had led him to become a significant figure in the local Chartist movement, which was then spreading about the country, supporting the idea that all men should have the right to vote, irrespective of their wealth or social standing. Many of the Chartists in the industrial areas of southern Wales took up arms in order to ready themselves for revolution against the government, and Price aided them in gaining such weaponry. According to government reports, by 1839 he had acquired seven pieces of field artillery. That same year, the Newport Rising took place, when many of the Chartists and their working class supporters rose up against the authorities, only to be quashed by soldiers, who killed a number of the revolutionaries. Price had recognised that this would happen, and he and his supporters had not joined in with the rebellion on that day. Nonetheless, he also realised that the government would begin a crackdown of those involved in the Chartist movement in retaliation for the uprising, and so he fled to France, disguised as a woman. = Life as an archdruid: 1840‚Äì1882 = It was while in temporary exile as a political dissident in Paris that Price visited the Louvre museum, where he experienced what has been described as \\"a turning-point in his religious life.\\" He became highly interested in a stone with a Greek inscription that he erroneously felt depicted an ancient Celtic bard addressing the moon. He subsequently interpreted the inscription as a prophecy given by an ancient Welsh prince named Alun, declaring that a man would come in the future to reveal the true secrets of the Welsh language and to liberate the Welsh people; however, historian Ronald Hutton later remarked \\"nobody else had heard of this person, or made (anything like) the same interpretation of the inscription\\". Nonetheless, Price felt that this prophecy applied to him, and that he must return to Wales to free his people from the English-dominated authorities. A photograph of Price taken while he was on stage in 1884. This displays some of his Druidic attire. Soon returning to Wales, Price set himself up as a Druid, founding a religious Druidic group that attracted a number of followers. Little is known of the specific doctrines which he preached, but his followers walked around carrying staffs engraved with figures and letters. Declaring that marriage was wrong as it enslaved women, he began having a relationship with a woman named Ann Morgan, whom he moved in with, and in 1842 she bore him a daughter. He baptised this child himself at the Rocking Stone in Pontypridd, naming her Gwenhiolan Iarlles Morganwg (meaning 'Gwenhiolan, Countess of Glamorgan').Hutton 2009. p. 255. He began developing an appearance that was unconventional at the time, for instance wearing a fox fur hat and emerald green clothing, as well as growing his beard long and not cutting his hair. He also began attempting to hold Druidic events, organising an eisteddfod at Pontypridd in 1844, but nobody turned up, and so, solitarily, he initiated his daughter as a bard at the event. In 1855 he then led a parade of the Ivorites, a friendly society that held to a philosophy of Welsh nationalism, through the streets of Merthyr Tydfil, accompanied by a half-naked man calling himself Myrddin (the Welsh name for Merlin) and a goat. Portrait of William Price in 1861 Returning to his long-held idea of building a museum and school at Pontypridd, a local landowner, Sir Benjamin Hall, who wanted to encourage the revival of Welsh culture, allowed him to use his own land, although Price and the Halls subsequently fell out and the project was scrapped. Left with debts from the aborted project, Price once more escaped to France in 1861. Around this time, he began writing to the national press, making exaggerated statements about himself and Welsh history, for instance claiming that he was Lord of the Southern Welsh and that \\"All the Greek Books are the Works of the Primitive Bards, in our own Language!!!!!!!‚Ä¶ Homer was born in the hamlet of Y Van near Caerphili. He built Caerphili Castle‚Ä¶ the oldest Books of the Chinese confess the fact!!\\"Hutton 2009. pp. 280‚Äì281. In 1866 Price returned to Wales, finding that his daughter had grown up to live her own life following her mother, Ann Morgan's, death. He settled in the town of Llantrisant, where he opened a new medical practice, which proved to be a success. He eventually he took a young farmer's daughter, Gwenllian Llewelyn, (1859‚Äì1948) who at the time was only twenty-one years old, to be his new partner, despite the fact that he was an old man by this time.Hutton 2009. p. 281. Despite his earlier pronouncements against marriage, he organised a Druidic wedding ceremony through which he married Gwenllian on 4 March 1881, on Price's 81st birthday. Taking place at the Rocking Stone in Pontypridd, it involved Price addressing the sun at noon, and women dressed as the Three Graces were involved. The ceremony attracted a large audience, who according to reports found the whole proceeding amusing.Hutton 2009. p. 282. Meanwhile, in 1871, he had published a book, written in his own invented form of Welsh that he believed was the true language of the ancient Welsh. In the work, which had a title that translated as The Will of My Father, Price conceptualised the universe being created out of a snake's egg by a supreme Father God. However, this work was largely ignored at the time and soon fell into obscurity.Hutton 2009. pp. 281‚Äì282. = Later life and advocacy of cremation: 1883‚Äì1893 = Gwenllian and Price's first child was born on 8 August 1883, a son whom Price named Iesu Grist (the Welsh for Jesus Christ), in an act of provocation against the traditional religion of the time, and also because he expected great things from his child. However, the infant died only five months later, on 10 January 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, thereby polluting the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, an act which at the time was taboo, although across the country there were already several proponents of it as a form of corpse disposal. He performed the funeral in the early evening of Sunday 13 January 1884, upon the summit of a hill to one side of Llantrisant. A number of local people noticed the fire, and upon discovering that Price was attempting to burn his infant son, surged on him. He was rescued from an angry mob by the police, who arrested him for what they believed was the illegal disposal of a corpse, and the body of his son, which had not yet been engulfed by the flames, was removed from the pyre.Hutton 2009. p. 283. Price with his friend Robert Anderson, who later lit Price's funeral pyre A post-mortem was performed on Iesu's body by a local doctor, who concluded that the child had died of natural causes and had not been murdered. Price was therefore not charged with infanticide, but was instead tried in a Cardiff courtroom for performing cremation rather than burial, which the police believed to be illegal. Price argued that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal either. The judge, Mr Justice Stephen (1829‚Äì1894), agreed. Price was freed, and returned to Llantrisant to find a crowd of supporters cheering for his victory. On 14 March, he was finally able to give his son a cremation involving his own personal Druidic prayers. The case set a precedent which, together with the activities of the recently founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act 1902. In 1885 the first official cremation of the remains of Jeanette Pickersgill (1814‚Äì1885) took place at Woking Crematorium, and ten cremations are recorded as being performed in the following year. A crematorium opened in Manchester in 1892, followed by one in Glasgow in 1895, Liverpool in 1896 and Birmingham Crematorium in 1903. The media interest in the court case had made Price famous, and he soon began to capitalise on this fame, selling three hundred medals, each depicting the cosmic egg and the snake that laid it, commemorating his victory, which sold at threepence each. He began to be invited to give lectures and attend public functions, but these did not prove to be particular successes, with much of his audiences not understanding either his philosophies, or his attire, which was made out of red cloth and embroidered with green letters.Hutton 2009. pp. 283‚Äì284. In late 1884, his wife gave birth to their second child, whom Price also named Iesu Grist, and on 27 May 1886 she then bore him a daughter, whom they named Penelopen.Powell 2005. p. 95. He believed that his son had an important future ahead of him, being the prophesied second coming of Jesus Christ, his namesake, and predicted that he would come to reign over the earth. Meanwhile, in 1892 he erected a pole which was over 60 feet high, with a crescent moon symbol at its peak, on top of the hill where his first son had been cremated, and noted that he wanted his funeral to take place there as well.Hutton 2009. p. 285. Price died at his home in Llantrisant on the night of 23 January 1893. His final words, when he knew that he was near death, were \\"Bring me a glass of champagne\\". He drank the champagne and died shortly afterward. On 31 January 1893, William Price was cremated on a pyre of two tons of coal, in accordance with his will, on the same hillside overlooking Llantrisant. It was watched by 20,000 people, and overseen by his family, who were dressed in a mix of traditional Welsh and his own Druidic clothing. His wife remarried, this time to a road inspector employed by the local council, and she gave up her Druidic beliefs to join a conventional Christian denomination, having her two children baptised into it, and Iesu Grist was renamed Nicholas, never fulfilling the ambitious predictions that his father had made about him.  Personal beliefs  Oil painting of Price by A. C. Hemming, 1918 (on display at the Wellcome Collection in London) Price held several strongly held beliefs that ran counter to the Victorian social norms of the time, and chose to promote them in a \\"most exhibitory fashion\\". Biographer Dean Powell considered him \\"a maverick and a rebel\\", but was unsure as to whether Price's eccentricity was a result of mental illness or not. A nudist, Price refused to wear socks, considering them to be unhygienic, and washed coins, fearing that they were a source of cross-contamination. He opposed vaccination, in part due to his brother's childhood death following an inoculation, and refused to treat patients who were tobacco smokers. He was an advocate of vegetarianism, believing that eating meat \\"brought out the beast in man\\", and denounced vivisection. Price opposed marriage, which he saw as the enslavement of women, instead advocating free love. Price also argued many fellow practitioners were nothing but 'poison peddlers', making their money selling drugs and profiting off the sick rather than tackling the cause of the illness. Price was also responsible for the building of the famous \\"Round houses\\" in Pontypridd. He convinced a local builder that he owned the land and these round houses were to be the gateway to his mansion. He neither owned the land nor a mansion. Price believed that religion was often used to enslave people, and despised \\"sanctimonious preachers\\". His religious beliefs have provided an influence on the modern druidic movement. Michell referred to him as \\"a natural shaman\\".Michell 1997. p. 6. Statue of William Price in the Bull Ring, Llantrisant  Legacy  Soon after Price's death, ballads commemorating him were composed and circulated throughout the local area for a number of years afterward. In 1896, an exhibition that commemorated his life was held in Cardiff, while a pamphlet biography of him was published to accompany it. A more significant biography of Price, written by Islwyn Nicholas, was published in 1940, entitled A Welsh Heretic. In 1947, the Cremation Society put up a plaque commemorating him in the town of Llantrisant, while a statue of him was unveiled in the town in 1982, depicting the doctor in his characteristic fox- skin headdress, arms outstretched.Llantrisant timeline This was followed in 1992 when a memorial garden was named after him, and an exhibition about him opened in the town's visitor centre. In a 1966 book examining the history of Llantrisant, author Dillwyn Lewis described Price as being \\"one of the most controversial figures of modern times.\\"Lewis 1966. p. 57. The historian Ronald Hutton later described him as \\"both one of the most colourful characters in Welsh history, and one of the most remarkable in Victorian Britain\\" while his biographer Dean Powell considered him \\"the most notable individual in 19th century Wales\\". A commemorative green plaque was unveiled at Rudry Parish Hall in 2017, to mark the nearby birthplace. Brian Davies, the former curator of Pontypridd Museum, said of Price: \\"He was a remarkable man, he supported free education for the poor, he funded the first local Co-operative store, he operated an NHS-style business model in his doctors surgery for 50 years, supported the movement for social reform and was a pioneer in medicine, to name but a few of his many contributions to society. It is vital that historical figures are remembered and commemorated and I am thrilled that Dr Price's Green Plaque will feature near his birthplace in Waterloo.\\" In 2020, American actor Robert Downey Jr. cited Dr William Price as his inspiration for his portrayal of Dr Dolittle in the new Hollywood adaption Dolittle. Downey Jr. received harsh criticism for his Welsh accent: \\"...But when a Hollywood actor tries to do so in a Welsh accent inspired by a nudist Victorian druid, perhaps its best that he doesn‚Äôt speak at all.\\" https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/downey-jr-talks-to-the-animals-but-with-a- terrible-welsh-accent-fgvs0ffh7  References  = Citations = = Sources = : : : : : External links *William Price at The Age *William Price at BBC Wales *William Price at 100 Welsh Heroes *Ballad of the cremation of Dr William Price, 1893 *Dr. Price of Llantrisant by Ap Idanfryn *Price, William (1800‚Äì1893) at oxforddnb.com Category:1800 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Chartists Category:Welsh socialists Category:19th-century Welsh medical doctors Category:People from Caerphilly Category:People from Llantrisant Category:People from Machen Category:People from Pontypridd Category:Neo-druids Category:Anti-vaccination activists Category:Anti- vivisectionists Category:British neopagans Category:Vegetarianism activists ","title":"William Price (physician)"},{"id":"859105","text":"Sir William Price (~1860 - 16 April 1938), born in Wales, was a farmer and industrialist, and a director of United Dairies Ltd.

He was a leading guitar virtuoso of the early 19th century.  Biography  Although born in Bisceglie, Giuliani's center of study was in Barletta where he moved with his brother Nicola in the first years of his life. His first instrumental training was on the cello‚Äîan instrument which he never completely abandoned‚Äîand he probably also studied the violin. Subsequently, he devoted himself to the guitar, becoming a very skilled performer on it in a short time. The names of his teachers are unknown, and we cannot be sure of his exact movements in Italy. He married Maria Giuseppe del Monaco, and they had a child, Michael, born in Barletta in 1801. After that he was probably in Bologna and Trieste for a brief stay; by the summer of 1806, fresh from his studies of counterpoint, cello and guitar in Italy, he had moved to Vienna without his family. Here he began a relationship with the Viennese Anna Wiesenberger (1784‚Äì1817), with whom he had four daughters, Maria Willmuth (born 1808), Aloisia Willmuth (born 1810), Emilia Giuliani (born 1813) and Karolina Giuliani (born 1817).Michael Lorenz: \\"New Light on Mauro Giuliani's Vienna Years\\" (Vienna, 2015) In Vienna he became acquainted with the classical instrumental style. In 1807 Giuliani began to publish compositions in the classical style. His concert tours took him all over Europe. Everywhere he went he was acclaimed for his virtuosity and musical taste. He achieved great success and became a musical celebrity, equal to the best of the many instrumentalists and composers who were active in the Austrian capital city at the beginning of the 19th century. Giuliani defined a new role for the guitar in the context of European music. He was acquainted with the highest figures of Austrian society and with notable composers such as Rossini and Beethoven, and cooperated with the best active concert musicians in Vienna. In 1815 he appeared with Johann Nepomuk Hummel (followed later by Ignaz Moscheles), the violinist Joseph Mayseder and the cellist Joseph Merk, in a series of chamber concerts in the botanical gardens of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, concerts that were called the \\"Dukaten Concerte\\", after the price of the ticket, which was a ducat. This exposure gave Giuliani prominence in the musical environment of the city. Also in 1815, he was the official concert artist for the celebrations of the Congress in Vienna. Two years earlier, on 8 December 1813, he had played (probably cello) in an orchestra for the first performance of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. In Vienna, Giuliani had minor success as a composer. He worked mostly with the publisher Artaria, who published many of his works for guitar, but he had dealings with all the other local publishers, who spread his compositions all over Europe. He developed a teaching career here as well; among his numerous students were Bobrowicz and Horetzky. In 1819 Giuliani left Vienna, mainly for financial reasons: he expected to make financial profit on a concert tour through Bohemia and Bavaria. He returned to Italy, spending time in Trieste and Venice, and finally settled in Rome. In 1822 he brought his illegitimate daughter Emilia to Italy, who had been born in Vienna in 1813. She was educated at the nunnery L'adorazione del Ges√π from 1821 to 1826, together with Giuliani's first illegitimate daughter Maria Willmuth. In Rome he did not have much success; he published a few compositions and gave only one concert. In July 1823 he began a series of frequent trips to Naples to be with his father, who was seriously ill. In the Bourbon city of Naples Giuliani would find a better reception to his guitar artistry, and there he was able to publish other works for guitar with local publishers. In 1826 he performed in Portici before Francesco I and the Bourbon court. In this time, which we could call Giuliani's Neapolitan period, he appeared frequently in duo concert with his daughter Emilia, who had become a skilled performer on the guitar. Toward the end of 1827 the health of the musician began to fail; he died in Naples on 8 May 1829. The news of his death created a great stir in the Neapolitan musical environment. =Quotes=  Works  =Theme and variations= As a guitar composer he was very fond of the theme and variations‚Äî an extremely popular form in Vienna. He had a remarkable ability to weave a melody into a passage with musical effect while remaining true to the idiom of the instrument. *One example of this ability is to be found in his Variations on a theme of Handel, Op. 107. This popular theme, known as \\"The Harmonious Blacksmith\\", appears in the Aria from Handel's Suite no. 5 in E for harpsichord. *Another example is Giuliani's Sei variazioni sull'aria \\"A Schisserl und a Reindl\\", op. 38, which is a set of variations on the Austrian folk song A Schisserl und a Reindl, is √•ll mein Kuchlg'schirr, used in the play Der Kaufmannsbude (1796), with music by Johann Baptist Henneberg (1768‚Äì1822) and text by Schikaneder; and in the play Der Marktschreyer (1799), with music by Franz Xaver S√ºssmayr (1766‚Äì1803) and text by Friedrich Karl Lippert. (Beethoven used the same theme in his work op.105, number 3 for flute and piano.) *His three-movement sonata Op. 15 is a clever, witty work and one of the most developed examples of the genre for guitar. *The several sets of extended Rossiniana reside at the pinnacle of nineteenth- century operatic pot pourri for guitar. Giuliani's achievements as a composer were numerous. Giuliani's 150 compositions for guitar with opus number constitute the nucleus of the nineteenth-century guitar repertory. He composed extremely challenging pieces for solo guitar as well as works for orchestra and Guitar-Violin and Guitar-Flute duos. Outstanding pieces by Giuliani include his three guitar concertos (op. 30, 36 and 70); a series of six fantasias for guitar solo, op. 119‚Äì124, based on airs from Rossini operas and entitled the \\"Rossiniane\\"; several sonatas for violin and guitar and flute and guitar; a quintet, op. 65, for strings and guitar; some collections for voice and guitar, and a Grand Overture written in the Italian style. He also transcribed many symphonic works, both for solo guitar and guitar duo. One such transcription arranges the overture to The Barber of Seville by Rossini, for two guitars. There are further numerous didactic works, among which is a method for guitar that is used frequently by teachers to this day. Today, Giuliani's concertos and solo pieces are performed by professionals and still demonstrate the ability of the guitarist to play the piece, as well as Giuliani's natural ability as a composer for the classical guitar. = Original Sources of Themes = Giuliani arranged many 19th century opera themes for the guitar, e.g. from the opera Semiramide by Gioachino Rossini. His work Le Rossiniane also includes numerous themes from the operas of Rossini.

Instruments used by Giuliani Of the instruments used by Giuliani, there are guitars made by: *possibly: Gennaro Fabricatore, (Naples 1809)Giuliani's Fabricatore guitar 2 image (now in the collection of Gianni Accornero) At the bottom of the guitar, one can see the initials M G. The guitarcase also has the initials M G. *briefly: Pons l'A√Æn√© (Joseph Pons), (Paris 1812) This Pons guitar was made for Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria in Paris 1812, and later given to Giuliani: is known to have been in Giuliani's possession only briefly.Found: A Giuliani Guitar, Kept In A London Bank Since 1816 by Paul Pleijsier, 2001 Giuliani later gave it to the amateur guitarist Christopher Bilderbeck de Monte as a present. However, Giuliani did not often play this 1812 guitar: it hardly shows signs of use. *unlikely: Pons l'A√Æn√© (Joseph Pons), (Paris 1825) (now in the collection of Gianni Accornero) The back cover of a CD claims \\"Giuliani's original Guitar Pons l'A√Æn√© 1825\\". Though this is probably a deceptive and possibly intentionally ambiguous claim. Gianni Accornero wrote the CD's liner notes about the guitar, and claims: \\"This instrument is in actual fact identical to the one which Joseph had made for Empress Marie-Louise of Habsburg, the wife of Napoleon, who later gave it to Giuliani. This instrument became one of his favourites. Not only the model is the same, but also are the different types of wood used for its construction.CD back cover image; Giuliani Concerto CD1 (also available: Giuliani Concerto CD2, or double CD) Liner notes about the instrument, written by Gianni Accornero.\\" However Paul Pleijsier is critical of these claims; and has found flaws and inconsistencies in Accornero's claims. Pleijsier states that there is no evidence that Giuliani ever played the 1825 Pons.Duimzuigerij over een Pons- gitaar Eduardo Catemario (the performer on the CD) notes \\"E\` interessante notare che questa Pons √® molto simile (per non-dire identica) a quella di Giuliani\\" (\\"It is interesting to note that this Pons is very similar (if not identical) to that of Giuliani\\").Catemario on the 1825 Pons guitar (see also)  Books about Mauro Giuliani  = Biographies = * Thomas F.

Owned by the National Trust since 1937, the Manor and its grounds are open to the public. It is one of only a few surviving examples of a house built and furnished under the influence of the Aesthetic movement and Arts and Crafts movement. The house is in a grand version of the half-timbered vernacular style, of which the most famous original example is Little Moreton Hall a few miles away (also National Trust). The house is a notable example of the influence of William Morris, with original Morris wallpapers and fabrics, De Morgan tiles, Kempe glass and Pre-Raphaelite works of art, including works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Evelyn De Morgan, Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, John Everett Millais, and Elizabeth Siddal. History Detail Wightwick was built by Theodore Mander, of the Mander family, who were successful 19th-century industrialists in the area (Mander Brothers), and his wife Flora, daughter of Henry Nicholas Paint, member of Parliament in Canada. It was designed by Edward Ould of Liverpool in two phases; the first was completed in 1887 and the house was extended with the Great Parlour wing in 1893. Notes taken by Theodore Mander at a lecture given in Wolverhampton in 1884 by Oscar Wilde on the 'House Beautiful' inspired Wightwick's interiors. Taking inspiration from this lecture, Theodore and his wife Flora decorated its interiors with the designs of William Morris and his Arts and Crafts contemporaries. However, the Pre-Raphaelite collection was mostly assembled after the house was donated to the National Trust, particularly by Geoffrey Mander and his second wife, Rosalie, who was an art historian. In 1937 Geoffrey Mander, a radical Liberal MP and local paint manufacturer who had been left the timber-framed house by his father Theodore, persuaded the National Trust to accept a house that was just 50 years old, under the Country Houses Scheme Act. This house of the Aesthetic Movement was, by 1937, a relic of an out of fashion era. Yet, so complete was the design that it was worthy of preservation. Having given the house to the Trust, Geoffrey Mander and his second wife, Rosalie, became its live-in curators, opening the house to the public and adding to its contents. In particular they added a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings by Rossetti, Burne- Jones and their followers. Descendants of the family retain a private apartment in the manor. House, Art Collection and Gardens The Manor has the work of 13 professional female artists on permanent public display, more than any other in the National Trust, including notable examples of works by Lizzie Siddal, Lucy Madox Brown, Marie Spartali Stillman, and May Morris. Most of these artworks were collected by the Manders. The malthouse gallery now houses a group of works by Evelyn De Morgan and her husband William, on loan from the De Morgan Trust. The house has 17 acres of woodland and gardens and the outbuildings include parts of an earlier Jacobean manor house, stables (now a tea room); a gallery in the old malt house; gift shop; and a second- hand bookshop. It is situated just off the main A454 Wolverhampton to Bridgnorth road, approximately three miles to the west of the city centre. The manor has been Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England since July 1950, and its gardens are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Following a preservationist effort that began in 1961, the site, now a National Historic Landmark, has become a popular tourist destination. Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, or Shakertown, as it is known by residents of the area, is located 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Lexington, in Kentucky's Bluegrass region. It is a National Historic Landmark District. History =Founding= Centre Family Dwelling, once home to over 100 Shakers, was constructed of limestone quarried from the top of the palisades of the Kentucky River. The Second Great Awakening began in the late 1700s and continued into the early 19th century. A revival was characterized by large camp meetings, where ministers from various Protestant groups would preach for long periods, with music and dancing often adding to the emotional pitch of the congregation. These religious gatherings sometimes drew thousands of observers and participants in the Ohio Valley of Kentucky. They were a form of community for people living scattered in relative isolation on the frontier the rest of the time. The powerful interest in religion sweeping the region inspired the Shakers to broaden their ministry into Kentucky. Lucy Wright, the head of the Shakers' parent Ministry at New Lebanon, New York, decided to send missionaries west. On January 1, 1805, with eleven Shaker communities already established in New York and New England, three Shaker missionaries, John Meacham, Benjamin Seth Youngs (older brother of Isaac N. Youngs), and Issachar Bates, set out to find new converts.Stephen J. Paterwic, Historical Dictionary of the Shakers (Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2008). Traveling more than a thousand miles, most of the way on foot, they joined the pioneers then pouring into the western lands by way of Cumberland Gap and the Ohio River. By August, they had gathered a small group of new adherents to the doctrine of Mother Ann Lee who believed in celibacy. Ann Lee was born February 29, 1736, in Manchester, England. She was a member of the Quaker sect called the Shaking Quakers. She ran afoul of the law and was imprisoned for trying to teach her sect's beliefs. During her time in prison, she claimed to have a vision that she herself was the second coming of Christ. Upon her release in 1772, she founded a new religious sect, which came to be commonly known as the Shakers because of the adherents' dancing and motions. She taught that God was a dual personage, male and female, instead of the masculine-orientated traditional belief in an all-male trinity. She interpreted the passage in Genesis that stated \\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female, created he them,\\" to mean that both sexes were in God's image therefore God was both male and female. She acknowledged that Jesus was the first coming of the messiah but believed the second coming had already occurred with herself, Ann Lee, based on her vision. Thus Shakers believed they were living in the last millennium and since all people shared a brother/sister relationship, they should not marry as there was no longer a need to procreate. Instead they believed people should live communally as a family of brothers and sisters.http://www.americanroads.net/Archives/Traditional_trails_Winter13.htm Couples joining the community lived separately, with their young children and foundlings raised in a nursery. Children could decide whether to remain in the community when they reached the age of maturity. Many of those proselytes had earlier been influenced by the fervent Cane Ridge Revival. In December 1806, forty-four converts of legal age signed a covenant agreeing to mutual support and the common ownership of property. They began living together on the farm of Elisha Thomas, whose lands formed the nucleus of the Pleasant Hill Shaker village. Additional converts and property were quickly added, with the community occupying . By 1812 three communal families‚ÄîEast, Center, and West‚Äîhad been formed, and a fourth, North, was established as a \\"gathering family\\" for prospective converts. On June 2, 1814, 128 Believers bound themselves together in a more formal covenant, which established the community in the pattern of the Shaker Ministry's village at New Lebanon, New York. =Early years= Staircase in Trustees' Office Though the Kentucky Shakers were poor when they started out, they were skilled farmers who made the most of their property. Even the most skeptical observers saw that they prospered, in part because of the high quality of their products. In 1852, a visitor wrote that every article of Shaker produce sold for a third more than what other farmers received.Nathaniel P. Willis, Health Trip to the Tropics (New York: Charles Scribner, 1853), p. 232. Another reason for their prosperity was their location, which was ideal for marketing their produce and home manufactures. By 1816, they regularly traveled the rivers to larger cities (some at great distances, such as New Orleans) to sell their wares.Paterwic 175. The Pleasant Hill Shakers raised broom corn and made flat brooms so good that they sold for more than \\"ordinary\\" brooms. They also raised fruit and sold it dried or as preserves (more than ten tons of preserves in one year). Like many other Shaker communities, they raised and sold garden seeds.\\"Shaker Farming in Kentucky,\\" Pittsfield Sun, January 15, 1857. By 1825, the Pleasant Hill Shaker village was a handsome community with large stone and brick dwellings and shops, grassy lawns, and stone sidewalks. One visitor, though dubious about their mode of worship, was impressed by their prosperity and delighted by their hospitality. He concluded that they were a \\"trafficking, humane, honest and thrifty people.\\"\\"Kentucky,\\" [New Bern] Carolina Sentinel, May 21, 1825, p. 1. Over the years they expanded their land holdings by acquiring adjacent farms for orchards and fields, and fenced it with stone walls. According to a visitor in 1857, they had paid a hired man for twelve years to work full-time at building stone walls, and he had completed forty miles of walls, at a cost to the Shakers of about $1000 per mile. Their buildings were large, substantial, and well-built, and furnished with modern conveniences. The Pleasant Hill community was known for its excellent livestock. In 1838, Shaker John Bryant sold one pair of Berkshire hogs for $500.\\"Encouragement of Agriculture,\\" National Aegis, December 19, 1838, p. 2. In the 1850s they kept about 500 head of well-fed cattle, and bred imported cows to improve their herd's milk production. They practiced selective breeding and scientific agriculture well before the average farmer did. They also raised Saxony sheep for the wool, which Shaker sisters spun and wove into cloth for home use.\\"Shaker Farming in Kentucky,\\" Pittsfield Sun, January 15, 1857; Lewis Falley Allen, American Shorthorn Herd Book, volume 2 (1855), p. 343. The Pleasant Hill Shakers were also known for their labor-saving engineering accomplishments. They had a municipal water system well before some towns in their area. By 1825 they had pumps in their kitchens for the sisters' convenience (at a time when many farmwives had to carry water from a creek). Their mill had an elevator for moving grain to the upper floor, and they had a mechanical corn sheller. Shaker sisters also had the benefits of machinery for doing laundry by horse power. One of their barns included an upper floor for storage of grain and hay, a cutting machine for chopping fodder, and an ingenious railway for delivering feed to the cattle. =Through the Civil War and Reconstruction era= The Kentucky Shakers' locations, however, were problematic during the American Civil War. Even before the war began, the Pleasant Hill Shakers ran into controversy. The New York-based religious organization had a policy of pacifism and was also opposed to slavery. Members who made up the Pleasant Hill society mostly came from the region and, as a result, may have had a variety of views on the war and slavery, although this cannot be proven by the sources. Formally they adhered to the principles of the Shakers. The Shakers at Pleasant Hill adopted the practice of buying and freeing slaves. In 1825, because of mounting tensions over slavery in Pleasant Hill's surrounding community, a mob attacked Pleasant Hill and destroyed some of its facilities. While members of Pleasant Hill were sympathetic to the Union, their Southern location made them the target of some neighbors and bands of extremists. (This experience was relatively similar to the Koinonia situation during the Civil Rights Movement.) Pleasant Hill was at risk during the war, although it did not suffer as much damage as its sister colony at South Union, Kentucky. The Civil War depleted Pleasant Hill's resources. The members of Pleasant Hill fed thousands of soldiers who came begging, particularly in the weeks surrounding the Battle of Perryville. Both armies \\"nearly ate [them] out of house and home.\\" They also lost manpower when some young Shaker brethren left to join the army.\\"Kentucky Shakers,\\" St. Louis Globe-Democrat, August 2, 1886, p. 3. More importantly, the social environment and cultural changes in the decades before and after the war made Shaker life less appealing for converts. During Reconstruction and later, very few new converts joined the Shakers. =Last days= Kentucky Shakers had a number of problems after the Civil War, which had sapped their communities' strength. They continued to take in orphans, but few stayed past the end of their indentures. So-called \\"Winter Shakers\\", impoverished locals feigning interest in joining the colony during the cold season, were a drain on the village, and rarely earned their keep. Apostasy increased.Julia Neal, The Kentucky Shakers (University of Kentucky Press, 1982), chapter 5. As membership declined, the Shakers began closing communities and consolidating Believers into the remaining villages. Pleasant Hill, which had once had almost five hundred members, dwindled away. By 1875, despite an influx of new proselytes from Sweden, it had fewer than half that number. In 1900, only 34 remained. The Pleasant Hill Shaker community was dissolved in 1910.Paterwic, Historical Dictionary of the Shakers; Stephen J. Stein, The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers (New Haven: Yale, 1992), p. 234. Its last surviving Believer was Mary Settles (1836-1923). She was pleased to live long enough to see women's suffrage and planned to vote a straight Democratic ticket on her first ballot. [Unable to find this exact claim at newspapers.com] She said that Shaker sisters had always had equal rights within their communal society.\\"Says Suffrage a Shaker Doctrine,\\" Lexington Herald, October 8, 1920, p. 20.

Many visitors to Pleasant Hill, observing the nineteenth-century architecture, crafts, and clothing, mistakenly assume that the Shakers, like the Amish, rejected technological advancements. In fact, the Shakers were inventors or early adopters of many new tools and techniques. For example, in the early 1830s the Shakers of Pleasant Hill constructed a water tower on a high plot of ground. A horse-drawn pump lifted water into the tower, and from there a system of pipes conveyed it to the kitchens, cellars, and wash houses. It is believed to have been the first in the state. In the wash houses, the members built washing machines (also powered by horses) to reduce the heavy work of laundering the community's clothes and linens. Music was an important part of Shaker life, with the community performing songs, hymns and anthems written by both men and women. One of the best known songs is \\"Gentle Words\\", written by Polly M. Rupe in the 1860s. It includes a quote from the Bible (). Preservation effort Following the dissolution of the Shaker society in 1910, the property changed hands several times and was used for a variety of purposes. Elderly Shakers continued to live on the property until the death in 1923 of Mary Settles, the last Pleasant Hill Believer. The Meeting House was converted for use as an automotive garage; the wood floor, built to withstand the dancing of several hundred brethren and sisters, proved strong enough to support the vehicles driven onto its surface. Some years later the structure was again converted, this time for use as a Baptist church. Following World War II, residents in the region took a renewed interest in the crumbling village of Pleasant Hill. An admirer was the writer Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk at the nearby Abbey of Gethsemani. Having mentioned Pleasant Hill in his writings as early as 1949, Merton took considerable interest in the community from his first visit there in 1959 until his death in 1968. Describing his first look inside the Trustee's Office in 1959, Merton wrote in his journal to describe: > [T]he marvelous double winding stair going up to the mysterious clarity of a > dome on the roof ... quiet sunlight filtering in‚Äîa big Lebanon cedar outside > one of the windows ... All the other houses are locked up. There is Shaker > furniture only in the center family house. I tried to get in it and a gloomy > old man living in the back told me curtly 'it was locked up.' The empty > fields, the big trees‚Äîhow I would love to explore those houses and listen to > that silence. In spite of the general decay and despair there is joy there > still and simplicity ... Shakers fascinate me. Others shared his interest. In 1961 a group of Lexington-area citizens led by Joseph Graves and Earl D. Wallace launched an effort to restore the property. By 1964 the Friends of Pleasant Hill had organized a non-profit corporation, raised funds for operating expenses, and secured a $2 million federal loan to purchase and restore the site. James Lowry Cogar, a former Woodford County resident and first curator of Colonial Williamsburg, was recruited to oversee the complex preservation project. Today, with 34 original 19th-century buildings and 2,800 acres (1100 hectares) of farmland, Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill claims to be \\"the largest historic community of its kind in America.\\" Gallery File:Shaker-Construction.jpgShaker Construction detail, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Construction2.jpgShaker Construction, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Meeting- House3.jpgShaker Furniture, Shaker Village, Meeting House, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Centre-Family-Dwelling,-Interior3.jpgShaker Furniture, Shaker Village, Centre Family Dwelling, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Centre-Family- Dwelling,-Interior2.jpgShaker Furniture, Shaker Village, Centre Family Dwelling, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Centre-Family- Dwelling,-Interior.jpgShaker interior, Shaker Village, Centre Family Dwelling, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Tables.jpgShaker Tables, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Furniture.jpgShaker Furniture, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Tool-Bench.jpgShaker Tool Bench, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Containers3.jpgShaker Containers, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker- Containers2.jpgShaker Containers, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Containers.jpgShaker containers, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Baskets.jpgShaker Baskets, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Window-Detail.jpgShaker Window Detail, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY File:Shaker-Wagon-Wheel.jpgShaker Wagon Wheel Detail, Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, KY See also * Shakers * Shaker Museum at South Union, Kentucky * Lucy Wright * Isaac N.

He was well known for his distinct film-making style, and the Indian film industry knew him as a master of unconventional themes and hard-hitting contemporary subject matter. Balachander's films are well known for their portrayal of women as bold personalities and central characters. Popularly referred to as Iyakkunar Sigaram (lit. \\"Director Paramount\\"), his films are usually centred on unusual or complicated interpersonal relationships and social themes. He started his film career in 1964 as a screenwriter and graduated to a director with Neerkumizhi (1965). In a career that spanned 50 years, he had contributed to nearly 100 feature films either as a screenwriter or director, thus becoming one of the most prolific filmmakers in the country. Known among his colleagues as a tough task master, he was credited with having nurtured numerous actors, notably Nagesh, Sujatha, Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Chiranjeevi, Jayaprada, Sridevi, Jayasudha, Saritha, Renuka, Nassar, Prakash Raj, Ramesh Aravind and Vivek. In his film career, Balachander had won nine National Film Awards and 13 Filmfare Awards. He was honored with the Padma Shri (1987), India's fourth highest civilian award, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema. He also made films under his production house, Kavithalaya Productions. Apart from Tamil, he made films in other languages such as Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Towards the tail end of his career, he directed a few TV serials and made a few film appearances as well. Early life and background K. Balachander was born in 1930 at Nannilam in the Tanjore district (now Tiruvarur district), India. Balachander stated that, \\"From my eighth year I've been seeing cinema\\" and recalls that his earliest interest towards cinema grew after watching films of M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, then the Superstar of Tamil cinema. At the age of twelve he was drawn to theatre and drama, which eventually helped him develop an interest in acting, writing and directing amateur plays. His obsession towards theatre continued even while doing his graduation (in Zoology) at the Annamalai University, as he regularly took part in stage plays. After completing his graduation in 1949, he started his career as a school teacher in Muthupet, Tiruvarur district. In 1950, he moved to Madras (now Chennai) and joined the Accountant General's office as an apprentice clerk, and during this time he joined \\"United Amateur Artistes\\", an amateur drama company. Soon he formed his own troupe and it was during this time he came to prominence as an amateur playwright with Major Chandrakanth, written in English. As the scope of English was highly limited in Madras, he re-wrote the play in Tamil, which ultimately became a \\"sensation\\" among the people. Balachander's acting troupe consisted of people from the Tamil film industry such as Major Sundarrajan, Nagesh, Srikanth and Sowcar Janaki. Sunderrajan appeared in over 900 films, Nagesh in over 1,000, Sreekanth in more than 200 films, and Sowkar Janaki appeared in more than 350 films. Other plays written by Balachander include Server Sundaram (Waiter Sundaram), Neerkumizhi (Water Bubble), Mezhuguvarthi (Candle), Naanal (Tall Grass) and Navagraham (Nine Planets). All these produced and directed by him, were received well by the critics. Career =Entry into films: 1960s= Balachander while working in the Accountant General's office, was offered to write the dialogues for the film Dheiva Thaai (1964 ) by its lead actor M. G. Ramachandran. Balachander was initially reluctant, as he was more theatre- oriented, but on the insistence of his friends he decided to work on the film. By this time he was promoted as a superintendent in his office. Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar acquired the rights of his play Server Sundaram, and decided to make a film based on it. The film dealt with the story of a waiting staff at a restaurant had Nagesh playing the lead. The film was directed by the renowned duo directors, Krishnan Panju. It won a lot of accolades including the Certificate of Merit for the third Best Feature Film in Tamil and Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film. During this time another play written and directed by him - Major Chandrakanth was adapted into a film in Hindi as Oonche Log. The film won a National Film Award. Balachander then made his directional debut through Neerkumizhi (1965) which in turn was based on his own play. The film's cast consisted of actors who were a part of Balachander's regular troupe. His following efforts included Naanal, Major Chandrakanth and Ethir Neechal, all based on his own plays. Major Chandrakanth was already filmed in Hindi as Oonche Log the previous year. The Tamil version Major Chandrakanth (1966 film) had Jayalalithaa playing the lead heroine role. In 1967 he made Bama Vijayam, a full-length comedy family drama film. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film was highly successful and remade in Telugu by Balachander himself. The success of both the versions prompted a Hindi remake titled Teen Bahuraniyan, produced by Gemini pictures. In 1969, Balachander made Iru Kodugal, a family drama starring Gemini Ganesan, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil. =1970s= During the 1970s, Balachander turned indie, making realist movies revolving around family and social issues. In 1971 he made four films. In 1973, he made Arangetram, which dealt with poverty and prostitution. The film centred on the eldest daughter of a conservative Brahmin household who becomes a prostitute to settle her siblings and support her family. It was ahead of its time in Tamil cinema mainly because of the controversial theme. The film also had Kamal Haasan playing his first major role as an adult actor. The actor would go on to act in 35 films under Balachander. He made his directorial debut in Hindi films with the film Aaina starring Mumtaz and Rajesh Khanna in 1977, which was remake of Arangetram. The same year, he made Sollathaan Ninaikkiren, based on a novel by Manian. The following year he made Naan Avanillai. He made the film on the insistence of Gemini Ganesan, who also produced and enacted the lead role. It is based on the Marathi play To Mee Navhech, revolved around a man who deceives and marries five women performing nine roles. The film met with commercial failure. However, Gemini Ganesan was adjudged the Best Tamil Actor at the following year's Filmfare Awards ceremony. Following that, Balachander's made Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), his second female-centric film after Arangetram that dealt with the story of a working woman who hails from a middle-class family. Inspired by the 1960 Bengali film Meghe Dhaka Tara, it explored the emotions of a young woman who happens to be the sole earner for her family. He decided to cast an actress who worked as a child actress till then, as his film heroine with the film Mondru Moodichu and gave break to Sridevi. The film Aboorva Raagangal was an original story about an inter-generational romance involving two families. It marked the acting debut of Rajinikanth, who would go on to establish himself as a leading actor. It won critical acclaim in spite of its controversial theme; it won three National Film Awards including the award for the \\"Best Feature Film in Tamil\\". During this period he made films mostly with Kamal Haasan as the lead actor. In 1976, he made three films: Manmadha Leelai, Anthuleni Katha and Moondru Mudichu. Manmadha Leelai explores the life of a womaniser, played by Kamal Haasan, who gets himself involved in affairs with women. Often considered ahead of its time, it achieved cult status and is considered a \\"trendsetter\\" in Tamil cinema. Anthuleni Katha, a Telugu remake of Aval Oru Thodar Kathai had Jayaprada in her first starring role. received equal acclaim in Andhra Pradesh as in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Avargal (1977) follows the life of a divorc√©e as she traverses relationships in reverse, from divorce, to marriage, to falling in love. Varumayin Niram Sigappu (1980) was a drama that charts the travails and conflict of being unemployed in a bombastic and harsh city. 47 Natkal (1981) traces the adversities of a newlywed Indian woman living with an scurrilous, expatriate husband in a Parisian suburb. The film was a launchpad for its lead actor Chiranjeevi =Bollywood success and Tamil film career 1981-99= Balachander re-entered the Hindi film industry after Aaina through Ek Duuje Ke Liye in 1981. He gave Rati Agnihotri her debut Hindi film with Ek Duje Ke Liye. The project was a remake of his own Telugu film Maro Charitra had Kamal Haasan repeating his role as a lead actor. The film marked the Bollywood debut of various artists including Kamal Haasan, Madhavi and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. Like the original, Ek Duuje Ke Liye emerged as a major box-office success and earned critical acclaim. Balachander received the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay, apart from two other nominations ‚Äì for Best Director and Best Story. The song \\"Tere Meere Beach Mein\\" became so popular, eventually winning a Filmfare Award for Anand Bakshi and a National Film Award for Balasubrahmanyam. He made Sindhu Bhairavi (1985), which is about the intellectual collision and subsequent romance between a lofty Carnatic musician and his ardent critic. He has worked with a variety of music directors like V.Kumar, M.S.Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraja, Maragathamani, V.S.Narasimhan and A.R.Rahman. The actors who were regular in his films in the period 1963 to 1990 were Gemini Ganeshan, Sowcar Janaki, Nagesh, Jayanthi, Sujatha, Rajnikanth and Kamal Haasan. =Later years= In 1998, he planned a film titled Thillana Thillana featuring Prashanth, Karthik, Meena and Simran in the lead roles, but the venture failed to develop. His later films include Parthale Paravasam (2001) and Poi (2006). =Television career= The period starting from the late 1980s till the late 1990s saw Balachander venturing into Television and making a number of Television series including Kai Alavu Manasu, Rail Sneham, Ramani vs Ramani, Oru Koodai Paasam, Kadhal Pagadai, Premi, Jannal, and Anni. Like his earlier films, most of his serials focussed on women, and portrayed them as strong personalities. In 2003, he made Sahana, that touted to be the sequel of his 1985 film Sindhu Bairavi. On venturing into Television, he noted \\"This medium helps to reach out to the public. That's why I am into making serials\\". In 2009, Balachander returned to theatre after a 40-year hiatus through the play Pournami, which had Renuka playing the lead role. Personal life In 1956, Balachander married Rajam while he was working at the Accountant General's Office. The couple had two sons named Kailasam and Prasanna and a daughter Pushpa Kandaswamy, who is the chairwoman of their production house Kavithalaya Productions. Kailasam was an entrepreneur while Prasanna, a Chartered Accountant, is the managing director and CEO of a leading investment bank in India. Balachander's elder son, Bala Kailasam, died on 15 August 2014 after contracting pneumonia, at the age of 54. He was the head of the television production company Minbinbangal, and delivered memorable series in Tamil includes, Balachandarin Chinnathirai, Kaialavu Manasu, Rail Sneham, and Marma Desam. Death Following a neurosurgery in November 2014, Balachander was admitted to Kauvery Hospital in Chennai on 15 December. Reports suggested that he was suffering from fever and from a urinary tract infection, but was recovering well. However, on 23 December 2014 he died due to complications from the urinary infection and other age-related ailments. He was cremated with full state honours at Besant Nagar electric crematorium the next day. He is survived by two of his three children. His elder son predeceased him by four months. His wife died on 24 November 2018, aged 84. Style, critique and public perception Balachander is revered as one of the best directors India has ever produced. His ideas were original and his subjects were complex ideas expressed via art. He is also known for introducing new faces to the film industry. He has introduced over 100 actors in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. Balachander had long associations with some senior artists in the South Indian film industry like Gemini Ganesan, Sowcar Janaki, Nagesh and Muthuraman. Even though he was not the one to discover them, he played a prominent role in shaping their careers. Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, two leading film actors in Tamil cinema, are often referred to as products of Balachander who has paired with each of them or worked with them as a trio in several films during the 1970s. Rajinikanth was chosen by Balachander to play a key supporting character in Apoorva Raagangal (1975) after noting that \\"there was something special about him\\". Sridevi, Srividhya, Jayapradha, Jayasudha, Jayachithra, Sujatha, Saritha were notable heroines that were introduced by Balachander. Nassar, Delhi Ganesh, Charlie, Madan Bob were some of the notable supporting actors introduced by him. After working in a few Kannada films, Prakash Raj was relaunched as an actor in Tamil cinema through his debut Duet (1995) and had also performed in some of Balachander's soap opera productions in the 1990s. Through Manathil Uruthi Vendum, Balachander launched Vivek as an actor, who initially worked with him as his assistant writer, and later went on to become a leading comedy actor. He also launched A.R. Rahman in the film Roja which was his production. When the old era was dominated by commercial action films, Balachander directed socially themed films with women as protagonists usually centred on unusual or complicated interpersonal relationships and social themes. He portrayed women as headstrong, intelligent and independent people. Balachander revealed that many of his messages from his films, he has drawn inspiration from poet Subramaniya Bharathi whom he had admired since his childhood. Screenwriter Gopu (of Gopu-Babu) said that he used to begin his script from the ending and then construct the plot.

Despite its status as a Royal Air Force station, it primarily supports United States Air Force (USAF) operations, and is currently the home of the 100th Air Refueling Wing (100 ARW). On 8 January 2015, the United States Department of Defense announced that operations at RAF Mildenhall would end and be relocated to Germany (Spangdahlem Air Base) and elsewhere within the UK. After a period of uncertainty it was confirmed in July 2020 that the relocation of operations would no longer take place and that Mildenhall would remain open for the foreseeable future. History RAF Mildenhall is named after the nearby town of Mildenhall, Suffolk. It was established as a Royal Air Force station in 1930, and opened in 1934. During World War II, RAF Bomber Command used the station for operational combat missions until 1945. Placed on standby status after the war, it was reopened by the Royal Air Force and became a USAF-RAF joint operation base on 11 July 1950. Assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) to station B-29 Superfortress bombers that date. It became a B-50 Superfortress base in 1952, and a B-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratofreighter base in 1953 until 1958. Closed for runway repairs throughout 1958, the Military Air Transport Service transferred its main United Kingdom terminal to Mildenhall from RAF Burtonwood on 1 March 1959; and the airfield became 'The Gateway to the United Kingdom', for most U.S. military personnel and dependents arriving or departing the United Kingdom since. Assigned from Strategic Air Command to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) on 1 September 1959, and RAF relinquished joint operations status that date. Has been in continuous USAFE operation to present. =Major US Air Force units assigned= *7511th Air Base Squadron, 11 July ‚Äì 26 September 1950 :redesignated: 7511th Air Base Group, 26 September 1950 ‚Äì 1 February 1953 :redesignated: 3910th Air Base Group, 1 February 1953 ‚Äì 15 April 1955 *2nd Bombardment Wing (deployed), 4 May ‚Äì 31 August 1951 *22nd Bombardment Wing (deployed), 7‚Äì12 September 1951 *93rd Bombardment Wing (deployed), 6 December 1951 ‚Äì 2 March 1952 *97th Bombardment Wing (deployed), 1 April ‚Äì 11 June 1952 *509th Bombardment Wing (deployed), 4 June ‚Äì 2 September 1952 *3913th Air Base Squadron, 15 April 1955 ‚Äì 1 January 1959 :redesignated: 3913th Combat Support Group, 1 January ‚Äì 1 September 1959 *53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, 10 August 1959 ‚Äì 18 March 1960 *1625th Support Squadron (MATS), 1 March 1959 ‚Äì 8 January 1966 *7513th Air Base Group, 1 September 1959 ‚Äì 1 July 1966 :redesignated: 7513th Tactical Group *513th Tactical Airlift Wing, 1 July 1966 ‚Äì 1 February 1992 *627th Military Airlift Support Squadron, 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 15 September 1978 *Third Air Force, 15 April 1972 ‚Äì 1 November 2005 *435th Tactical Airlift Group, 1 July 1975 ‚Äì 15 September 1978 *306th Strategic Wing, 1 July 1978 ‚Äì 1 February 1992 *313th Tactical Airlift Group, 15 September 1978 ‚Äì 1 February 1992 *100th Air Refueling Wing, 1 February 1992 ‚Äì present *95th Reconnaissance Squadron, 1 July 1994 ‚Äì present *352nd Special Operations Group, 17 February 1995 ‚Äì present *501st Combat Support Wing, 12 May 2005 ‚Äì 30 April 2007 Fletcher, Harry R.

Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. =Operational history= Origins RAF Mildenhall opened on 16 October 1934. King George V reviewed 350 aircraft there in 1935 on the occasion of his Silver Jubilee. This historical event is commemorated by a memorial tablet located in front of the Building 562, the current 100 ARW headquarters. During World War II, Mildenhall became a bomber station, flying Vickers Wellingtons, Short Stirlings and Avro Lancasters. It was also the headquarters of 3 Group Bomber Command. From 1950, Mildenhall became home to bombers and later tanker aircraft of the United States Air Force. Throughout the 1950s, Strategic Air Command bomber units were deployed on a regular rotational basis from the United States to the United Kingdom. The B-47 Stratojet was a familiar sight in the skies over RAF Mildenhall and RAF Upper Heyford at this time, as entire wings deployed on 90-day rotations. From 1976 to 1990, the SR-71 Blackbird was flown out of Mildenhall by Detachment 4 of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the USAF. RAF Mildenhall was, until 2003, the home of the largest military-sponsored air show in Europe, when it was cancelled because of increasing operational requirements. In order to meet a perceived 'continental threat', the British military developed the idea to site an RAF bomber base at Mildenhall in the late 1920s. Shortly thereafter, the government purchased the land in 1929, followed by the completion of the first buildings in 1931. Three years later, RAF Mildenhall opened on 16 October 1934, as one of the RAF's largest bomber stations. On the same day, Wing Commander Francis Linnell, O.B.E. assumed his position as the stations's first station commander. Although open, the airfield had yet to receive its first complement of military aircraft. RAF Mildenhall's premature inauguration was due in large part with its selection to host the Royal Aero Club's prestigious MacRobertson Air Race on 20 October 1934. At the time, the air race stood as the longest race ever devised, and attracted over 70,000 spectators to the airfield. Even more telling of the race's significance in the world's sporting spotlight, on short notice King George V and Queen Mary visited RAF Mildenhall the day before the race. In the end, pilots Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott flying the de Havilland Comet Grosvenor House, crossed the finish line first at Melbourne, Australia, less than 72 hours after starting the race. Following this propitious beginning, RAF Mildenhall received its first squadron and aircraft with the arrival of 99B Squadron, equipped with Handley Page Heyford bombers. The threat the RAF had envisioned in the late 1920s materialised during the Munich Crisis. Between 26 September 1938 and 4 October 1939, the airfield completed its installation of its defence systems. After a brief reprieve from war, the airfield prepared for war, bringing station defences and squadrons to full combat readiness. On 3 September 1939, three days after Germany invaded Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Later that same day, three Wellington aircraft from Mildenhall were dispatched to bomb the German naval fleet at Wilhelmshaven. World War II Throughout World War II, RAF Mildenhall remained active as in addition to its own airfield, the base had responsibility for Newmarket, Tuddenham, and Lakenheath. During the course of the war, the base witnessed the transition from the two-engine Wellington, to the four-engine Short Stirling, and finally to the Avro Lancaster. In 1941 RAF Mildenhall was used for the making of the film Target for Tonight. So as not to give away important information to the enemy, RAF Mildenhall took the fictitious name of Millerton Aerodrome and several other aspects were altered involving the day- to-day operations. The film, produced by the Crown Film Unit, focused on the planning and execution of an air raid on Germany, as seen by the crew of Vickers Wellington OJ-F 'F for Freddie'. Dickson, the captain of 'F for Freddie', was played by Percy Pickard, who went on to lead Operation Biting and the later Operation Jericho raids on Amiens Prison, in which he was killed. For the duration of the war, except for a brief period to have concrete runways laid in 1943, RAF Mildenhall was involved in most of RAF Bomber Command's offensives and was attacked several times by the German Luftwaffe but was never out of commission for more than a day. By the end of the war, aircraft from RAF Mildenhall and its satellite airfields had dropped over 23,000 tons of explosives, laid 2,000 mines and flew over 8,000 sorties. The airfield also saw the loss of over 200; Wellington, Stirling, and Lancaster bombers with the loss of over 2,000 aircrew. One of those killed, was Pilot Officer Rawdon Hume Middleton, an Australian who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) and is buried at St. Johns Church cemetery in Beck Row after his body was washed ashore. After the war, Aircraft from RAF Mildenhall flew home repatriated prisoners of war in Operation Exodus, and participated in Operation Manna, dropping relief supplies to the Dutch people stranded by the flooding caused by the retreating German Wehrmacht. By the end of 1945, Mildenhall's operational activity experienced a drastic decrease and despite a brief flurry of flying activity in the late 1940s, the RAF reduced the base to 'care and maintenance' status. The only remaining RAF unit of significance was Headquarters No 3 Group, Bomber Command, which remained on station until 1967. The following units operated from Mildenhall: *No. 1 Engine Consumption Unit RAF *No. 3 Blind Approach Training Flight RAF *No. 3 Group Communications Flight RAF *No. 4 (Bomber) Group RAF *No. 5 (Bomber) Group RAF *No. 25 Heavy Glider Maintenance Section RAF *No. 32 Base RAF *No. 149 Conversion Flight RAF *No. 401 (Meteorological) Flight RAF *No. 1503 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF *No. 1505 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF *Engine Consumption Unit RAF *Regional Control School RAF USAF use of RAF Mildenhall After the 1950 invasion of South Korea by Communist forces, it was decided to re-establish a strong American force in Europe. On 11 July 1950, RAF Mildenhall was made available to the United States Air Force by the UK's Ministry of Defence as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-29 Superfortress bomber airfield, with joint operations with the Royal Air Force units. Prior to Strategic Air Command's role at RAF Mildenhall, Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe established Third Air Force at South Ruslip Air Station in 1948, to command B-29 operations in England. Third Air Force was subsequently placed directly under USAF orders, with Strategic Air Command establishing the 7th Air Division Headquarters at RAF Mildenhall. The collocation of the two headquarters within the United Kingdom allowed HQ USAFE to discharge its responsibilities in England, while at the same time allowing Strategic Air Command to continue in its deterrent role while retaining operational control over flying activities at RAF Mildenhall.  Strategic Air Command use  The initial Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit to use RAF Mildenhall was the 7511th Air Base Group (later redesignated 3910th AB Group), being activated on 11 July 1950, to prepare the facility for operational use by SAC aircraft. On 1 May 1951 the Strategic Air Command took control of the station rotated Bomb Wings in and out of Mildenhall on temporary duty assignments. The first operational strategic unit to use the airfield was the Boeing B-50D Superfortress equipped 2nd Bomb Wing, arriving on Temporary Duty (TDY) 4 May 1951 from Hunter AFB Georgia, departing on 12 December 1951. Other rotational strategic bomb wings at Mildenhall were: *22nd Bombardment Wing (7 September 1951 ‚Äì 12 December 1951) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from March AFB California) *93rd Bombardment Wing (16 December 1951 ‚Äì 8 March 1952) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from Castle AFB California) *509th Bombardment Wing (4 June 1952 ‚Äì 2 September 1952) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from Walker AFB New Mexico) Boeing B-50D Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, 1951 In 1953 RAF Mildenhall's mission was changed from a B-50 bomber airfield to a Boeing B-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratofreighter aerial tanker dispersal base. This series of temporary deployments generally involved an entire wing of about 40 B-47s and about 20 tankers being held at readiness for several months, then being relieved by another unit that was based at a different airfield in the UK with the bombers and tankers also at different airfields. In this way SAC could spread out its potential as a Soviet target by placing its short range B-47s, weapons, and personnel on a ring of overseas bases from Greenland to North Africa, of which Mildenhall was one. *55th Air Refueling Squadron (April 1953 ‚Äì June 1954) (KB-50, KB-29P) (TDY from Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico) *306th Air Refueing Squadron (June 1953 - September 1953) (KC-97) (TDY from MacDill AFB, Florida) *305th Air Refueling Squadron (September 1953 ‚Äì December 1953) (KC-97) (TDY from MacDill AFB, Florida) *22nd Air Refueling Squadron (7 December 1953 ‚Äì 5 March 1954) (KC-97) (TDY from March AFB, California) *303rd Air Refueling Group (17 March 1954 ‚Äì 5 June 1954) (KC-97) (TDY from Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona) *1370th Photo Mapping Group (June 1954 ‚Äì September 1954) (RB-50G) (Photographic Reconnaissance) (TDY from Morrison AFB, Florida) *97th Bombardment Wing (Summer 1954) (RB-50E/G, KB-29P) (Electronic Reconnaissance) (TDY from Biggs AFB, Texas) *43rd Air Refueling Group (August 1954 ‚Äì December 1954) (KC-97) (TDY from Carswell AFB, Texas) *306th Air Refueling Squadron (7 December 1953 ‚Äì 5 March 1954) (KC-97) (TDY from MacDill AFB, Florida) *98th Air Refueling Squadron (7 November 1955 ‚Äì 31 January 1956) (KC-97) (TDY from Lincoln AFB, Nebraska) *Mildenhall Task Force (Provisional) (1 July 1956 ‚Äì May 1958) (RB/ERB-47H) (Electronic Reconnaissance and Countermeasures) (TDY from 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Forbes AFB, Kansas) *380th Air Refueling Squadron (3 April 1957 ‚Äì 3 July 1957) (KC-97) (TDY from Shilling AFB, Kansas) *44th Air Refueling Squadron (Autumn 1957) (KC-97) (TDY from Chennault AFB, Louisiana) These TDYs became a heavy burden for both SAC as well as Military Air Transport Service (MATS), which had to transport thousands of personnel and tons of material to and from the United States in just a few days to support these rotations. In 1958, it was decided that these rotational TDYs would be replaced by a new system of overseas deployments called Reflex. From then on, rather than being deployed for a few months, a permanent SAC presence would be established at bases with aircraft being deployed for three weeks from several SAC bases, being kept on full alert status ready for instant takeoff at their 'Reflex Bases'. The RB-47s based at RAF Mildenhall performed some of the most sensitive reconnaissance missions of the Cold War. During its service, at least two of these planes were lost flying missions over the Soviet Union. One incident occurred during a photographic mission over the Soviet Union. The plane was intercepted and fired upon by Soviet MiGs and sustained wing damage. Fortunately, it was able to outrun them at altitude and return to RAF Mildenhall. The RB-47s were eventually phased out and replaced with the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71. (See 306th Strategic Wing below) In 1958 and the first half of 1959, the RAF Mildenhall runway was closed for repairs, and on 1 September 1959, the Royal Air Force ceased regular flying operations, making the USAF the sole operator of the base. The host base SAC support unit at RAF Mildenhall was the 3910th Air Base Group, changing to the 3932d AB Squadron and lastly 3934th AB Squadron. These units provided the administrative, maintenance and logistical support necessary to the rotating operational wings and squadrons.

On 17 July 1959, SAC and USAFE reached an agreement facilitating and substantially increasing Third Air Force's role in making operational decisions regarding the US Air Force units in the UK. On 1 July 1959, USAFE took control of Mildenhall from SAC and the 7543rd Air Base Squadron was activated by USAFE as the host unit. On 1 September the 7513th Tactical Group took over host unit responsibilities. RAF Mildenhall became the home for the Military Air Transport Service (later Military Airlift Command) main air passenger terminal for the United Kingdom on 1 March 1959 with the 1625th Support Squadron providing military personnel and dependents service at the terminal with the drawdown at the Burtonwood Air Depot. The 53rd Weather Squadron was transferred to Mildenhall from RAF Alconbury on 10 August 1959, flying WB-50D Superfortresses and was assigned with collecting weather data that was transmitted to weather stations for use in preparing forecasts required for the Air Force Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and the U.S. Weather Bureau. It was inactivated on 18 March 1960. On 15 November 1965 Mildenhall welcomed the arrival of the Silk Purse Control Group and the 7120th Airborne Command and Control Squadron (7120 ACCS) previously stationed at Chateauroux Air Station, France. Upon its arrival at Mildenhall, the 7120th ACCS converted from C-118s to EC-135s which were used as airborne command posts under the code name Operation Silk Purse. =513th Tactical Airlift Wing= 306th Air Refueling Squadron KC-10 Arriving at RAF Mildenhall 1986 Seven KC-135R Stratotankers move on the RAF Mildenhall taxiway as part of a training mission to validate maintenance and operational capabilities On 1 July 1966, the 513th Troop Carrier Wing arrived at Mildenhall from Evreux-Fauville Air Base France. With its activation on Mildenhall, the 513th TCW assumed operational control of two rotational (7441st, 7742nd) Troop Carrier Squadrons of twenty MAC C-130 Hercules and received the 7120th ACCS / Silk Purse Control Group from Chateauroux Air Station, France, and the five Boeing EC-135H 'Silk Purse' Flying Command Posts for European Command.Air Force Historical Research Agency, IRIS 1001387: History of the 513th Tactical Airlift Wing, 1 Apr ‚Äì 30 June 1974 On 8 July 1958, the US Air Force re-designated the 513 TCW the 513th Tactical Airlift Wing (513 TAW), with no change in its mission. For the next four years, RAF Mildenhall witnessed little change, with only the 10th ACCS replacing the 7120th ACCS on 1 January 1970, and assuming its mission. However, in June 1972, the base added to the list of its tenants with the arrival of Headquarters Third Air Force, which relocated from South Ruislip Air Station. In May 1969 mechanic Sgt Paul Meyer, homesick for his wife in Virginia, stole a Hercules C-130E transporter and flew south, eventually ditching in the English Channel. In April 2018 an underwater search of the aircraft, using sonar, was announced by the Deeper Dorset group. =306th Strategic Wing= On 1 July 1978, the SAC 306th Strategic Wing was transferred to RAF Mildenhall from Ramstein Air Base, West Germany with a KC-135 air refuelling and a RC-135 reconnaissance mission. The 306th also functioned as the focal point for all SAC operations in Europe, and became the host unit at RAF Mildenhall. MAC cargo and passenger transport operations continued under the 435th Tactical Airlift Group. With the arrival of the 306th SW, Mildenhall also became known as SAC's European Reconnaissance centre. For many years, various types of Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft were observed regularly arriving and departing from the Mildenhall runway. Most of these aircraft came from the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, and had the capability to receive radar and radio signals from far behind the borders of the Communist Eastern Bloc. From Mildenhall, the RC-135s flew ELINT and COMINT missions along the borders of Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The twenty or so specialists on board the RC-135s during such missions listened to and recorded military radio frequencies and communications. The next significant event in Mildenhall's history came with the arrival of Detachment 4, 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing in 1976, which controlled rotational Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird operations from the base. It is not known when SAC first began making reconnaissance flights in Europe with these aircraft. There are indications that these fast aircraft have been operating in Europe since the end of the 1960s, with an SR-71 making a stopover in August 1970 at RAF Upper Heyford, England, before a mission over the Middle East. These aircraft carried out strategic photo reconnaissance missions for NATO and the USAF within the framework of the SALT I Agreement of 1972. Under this agreement, the Soviet Union and the United States reached agreement on a partial freeze on the number of offensive nuclear weapons, and these flights were to check that the Soviets were adhering to the agreement. As well as the photo missions, the 9th SRW gathered telemetry signals from Soviet missile systems. Such missions were carried out using the SR-71 and U-2/TR-1 aircraft, and Boeing RC-135s from the 55th SRW. This information was analysed, together with information originating from reconnaissance satellites, to present an intelligence picture for analysis to assemble a good picture of Soviet activities for national decision-making. The 306th SW also played a major role in the success of Operation El Dorado Canyon, the American attack on the Libyan capital of Tripoli in 1986. In support of this 14-hour, radio-silence rendezvous mission, the unit deployed the largest number of refuelling aircraft ever flown over Europe, and the largest fleet of KC-10's ever airborne at one time. In addition, the day after the attack, 9th SW aircraft made several unmolested flights over the bombed military targets in and around Tripoli and Benghazi. From their arrival, until the departure of the last SR-71 on 18 January 1990, the 306th Strategic Wing's SR-71 and U-2 aircraft came to symbolise RAF Mildenhall in the local public's eye. On 18 June 1987, HQ USAFE designated the 513 TAW as the 513th Airborne Command and Control Wing (513th ACCW), with responsibility for the E-3 Sentry AWCS aircraft at Mildenhall. The 513th ACCW's mission was to provide theatre and Air Force commanders with trained aircrews and maintenance personnel and systems for airborne surveillance, warning and control of U.S. and allied military aviation assets. Nearly five years later, during the Air Force's transition to the objective wing structure, the Air Force inactivated the 513th ACCW on 31 January 1992. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, and lessening of Cold War tensions, the 'Silk Purse' mission of the 10th ACCS came to an end on 31 December 1991, and the unit was inactivated. Post Cold War Team Mildenhall logo The 306th SW operated at RAF Mildenhall until 1 February 1992, when the 100th Air Refueling Wing of USAFE, assumed the 306th SW responsibilities, and became host unit at Mildenhall, along with becoming Headquarters European Tanker Task Force with its KC-135 Stratotankers. The 100th ARW provides aerial refuelling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as aircraft of allied nations. Its aircraft are also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. In May 1993, as part of the drawdown of forces in Europe, it was announced that the majority of the USAF-operated base at RAF Alconbury was to be returned to the British Ministry of Defence. As a part of this return, the 352nd Special Operations Group and its associated aircraft, the MC-130E, HC-130P/N and MH-53, transferred to RAF Mildenhall in March 1995. On 1 July 1994, the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron was activated at Mildenhall, essentially taking over the mission of the inactivated 306th Strategic Wing. =21st century= During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the 491st Air Expeditionary Group operated from the base, with the 491st Air Expeditionary Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron and the 744th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, flying the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter (C-141C). Also attached to the 491 AEG was the 791st Expeditionary Aeromedical Airlift Squadron, now located at Ramstein AB, Germany. The 491 AEG had nearly 800 personnel, staging Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard (ANG) C-141Cs and their aircrew and aeromedical crews from RAF Mildenhall, UK, Rhein-Main and Ramstein AB, Germany, NAS Sigonella, Sicily, and NAS Rota, Spain. At one point, 18 C-141Cs were on the ground at RAF Mildenhall at the same time.  Role and operations  RAF Mildenhall, together with its sister base RAF Lakenheath, have the largest United States Air Force presence in the United Kingdom. =100th Air Refueling Wing= The host unit at RAF Mildenhall is the 100th Air Refueling Wing (100 ARW), which deploys aircraft for and manages the European Tanker Task Force, a rotational force which provides air refuelling to US and NATO aircraft in the European Theatre. It is the only permanent USAF air refuelling wing in the European theatre, activated at RAF Mildenhall on 1 February 1992. The wing provides the critical air refuelling 'bridge' that allows the Expeditionary Air Force to deploy around the globe with the appropriate urgency. The tactical component of the 100 ARW is the 351st Air Refueling Squadron (351 ARS), flying the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker. =501st Combat Support Wing= The 501st Combat Support Wing (501 CSW) was activated at RAF Mildenhall on 21 May 2005. It is a non-flying unit that provides administration and operation of the various smaller Air Force units scattered across the UK that are considered Geographically Separate Units (GSU): * 422nd Air Base Group, RAF Croughton * 423rd Air Base Group, RAF Alconbury * 420th Air Base Group, RAF Fairford It was moved to RAF Alconbury in 1 May 2007. =352nd Special Operations Wing= The 352nd Special Operations Wing (352 SOW) is the air force component for US Special Operations Command Europe, a sub-unified command of the US European Command. It transferred to RAF Mildenhall on 17 February 1995, from RAF Alconbury. The 352 SOW has two flying squadrons, a maintenance squadron, an operations support squadron and a special tactics squadron. The mission of the 352nd SOW is to serve as the focal point for all US Air Force special operations activities throughout the European theatre, including Africa and the Middle East. The 352 SOW is tasked to conduct a variety of high priority, low-visibility missions supporting US and allied special operations forces throughout the European theatre during peacetime, joint operations exercises and combat operations. The 352nd SOW develops and implements peacetime and wartime contingency plans. It effectively uses fixed-wing and personnel assets in infiltration by, exfiltration by and resupplying of US and allied special operations forces. The tactical components of the 352nd SOW are the: * 7th Special Operations Squadron (Bell Boeing CV-22 Osprey aircraft) * 67th Special Operations Squadron (Lockheed MC-130J Commando II aircraft) * 321st Special Tactics Squadron * 352nd Special Operations Support Squadron * 352nd Special Operations Maintenance Squadron * Joint Special Operations Air Component- Europe (JSOAC-E) =95th Reconnaissance Squadron= The 95th Reconnaissance Squadron (95 RS) of the US Air Force conducts RC-135 Rivet Joint flight operations in the European and Mediterranean theatres of operations; as tasked by National Command Authorities and European Command. It was activated at RAF Mildenhall on 1 July 1994, having been previously assigned to RAF Alconbury. The squadron provides all operational management, aircraft maintenance, administration, and intelligence support to produce politically sensitive real-time intelligence data vital to national foreign policy. The 95th RS supports RC-135, OC-135, and E-4 missions when theatre deployed. =488th Intelligence Squadron= The 488th Intelligence Squadron (488 IS) is a component of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA). The unit's primary mission is the collection, analysis, and reporting of signals intelligence about foreign command and control, communications, and weapons systems. Currently assigned to the 488th Intelligence Squadron for administrative purposes is Operating Location Souda Bay, Crete. The present 488th Intelligence Squadron traces its lineage back to the 6954th Security Squadron which was originally designated Detachment 1 of the 6985th SS at RAF Upper Heyford, England, in June 1967. The unit was transferred to RAF Mildenhall, England, and in August 1970, and in 1974 was designated as the 6954th SS. In August 1979, the 6954th Security Squadron was re-designated as the 6988th Electronic Security Squadron in honour of the unit that operated out of Yokota, Japan, for nearly 20 years. On 9 January 1981, the 6988th ESS received the first operational deployment of the 'Block III' electronically modernised RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft. The unit was also responsible for the maintenance of Lockheed U-2R reconnaissance aircraft deployed for Central European Theater operations during the Cold War until 10 February 1982, when the TR-1 variant of that aircraft replaced it. In November 1990, the operations of all RC-135 aircraft in the European theatre were assigned to the 6988th ESS upon the inactivation of the 6916th Electronic Security Squadron at Hellenikon Air Base, Greece. Until Hellenikon operations ceased in March 1991, they were conducted through the unit's OL-RH detachment. In October 1991, the 6988th ESS became part of the Air Force Intelligence Command (AFIC), a consolidation of the Air Force's intelligence operations and the successor to the ESC. On 1 October 1993, the unit was re-designated the 488th Intelligence Squadron. In February 2000, the 488th IS operated the first 'Baseline 8' RC-135W reconnaissance aircraft which was a major external reconfiguration of that platform. On 1 October 2002, the 488th IS was re- aligned from the 67th Information Operations Wing to the 55th Wing to consolidate all operations of the different RC-135 platforms. The unit is now part of the AFISRA, which became the successor of the AIA in June 2008. The 488th Intelligence Squadron, under its different unit designations, has received nine Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. =727th Air Mobility Squadron= The 727th Air Mobility Squadron (727 AMS) is a unit of the US 721st Air Mobility Operations Group, based at Ramstein AB, Germany. The 727 AMS is part of AMC's en-route system that provides fixed and deployed maintenance, aerial port, and command and control support to deployed command forces across the globe. The squadron has all the necessary support, such as fleet service, maintenance, and passenger service to allow aircraft and crews to quickly depart for their next destination or stay overnight for crew rest. The squadron was redesignated as the 727 AMS on 15 March 2001. Prior to that, it was designated as the 627th Air Mobility Support Squadron assigned to the 621st Air Mobility Support Group. The change in designation was undertaken to better reflect the operations nature of the group's overall mission as an operational rather than support one.Beech C-45 Expediter and Douglas C-117D Super Dakota communications aircraft of NAF Mildenhall at their home base in 1966 =Fleet Industrial Supply Center Sigonella, Detachment Mildenhall= FISCSI Mildenhall is a US Navy detachment of Fleet Industrial Supply Center Sigonella, Italy. The detachment was originally an aviation command known as Naval Air Facility Mildenhall, supporting Commander, US Naval Forces Europe (COMUSNAVEUR) headquarters in London. As NAF Mildenhall, the command was home to three Navy UC-12 Huron aircraft, and provided support for transient US Navy and US Marine Corps aircraft. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the frequency of US naval aircraft transiting RAF Mildenhall dissipated, and with COMUSNAVEUR's subsequent relocation to Naples, Italy, the command's UC-12 aircraft were also reassigned. After being at RAF Mildenhall for more than 40 years, NAF Mildenhall was disestablished in 2005, downsized and then re- established as FISCSI Det Mildenhall. The mission of FISCSI Det Mildenhall is U.S. Navy fleet support in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. The support includes receiving and shipping high priority parts and mail to the US naval units within that area.  Based units  Flying and notable non-flying units based at RAF Mildenhall.

In January 2016, as a result of the proposed US withdrawal, the UK government announced the site was one of twelve that would be sold as part of their strategy for the Ministry of Defence estate, although no date for the sale was given. It was planned to relocate units based at Mildehall to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. A change in political administration in the United States, heightened security concerns on the part of the United States, the United Kingdom and NATO pertaining to Europe and the Middle East, and a variety of other issues prompted a reassessment on Mildenhall's closure. By 2017, the closure process had been put on indefinite hold and in February 2020, it was reported it had been extended to at least 2027. In July 2020, the Department of Defense announced that the US military would in fact be withdrawing from Spangdahlem Air Base and that the 100th Air Refueling Wing and 352nd Special Operations Wing would remain at Mildenhall, thereby keeping the base open for the foreseeable future. Protests Since the beginning of its use by the USAF, Mildenhall has been the site of many anti-war protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups. In January 2003, students cut a hole in the perimeter fence and accessed the base.https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/protesters-arrested-at-suffolk- base-1-131793 Later, in April 2003, protestors with Stop the War Coalition broke into the base to unfurl a banner with the words: ‚ÄúStop Killing Each Other‚Äù.https://www.stripes.com/news/protesters-climb-fence-at-raf- mildenhall-1.3776 Notable protesters include MP and former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former CND chair Kate Hudson.https://cnduk.org/peace-camps- set-raf-mildenhall-brize- norton/https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/cambridge/2006/10/352412.html See also * List of Royal Air Force stations * RAF Thorpe Abbotts * Strategic Air Command in the United Kingdom References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Maurer, Maurer.

Located immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus, it is the upper left star of the Great Square of Pegasus. Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star, with overall apparent visual magnitude +2.06, it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit. The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury-manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury, manganese, and other elements, including gallium and xenon.Alpheratz, Kaler Stars 2/14/2013 It is the brightest mercury-manganese star known.  Nomenclature  Alpha Andromedae is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda (right). Œ± Andromedae (Latinised to Alpha Andromedae) is the star's Bayer designation. Ptolemy considered Alpha Andromedae to be shared by Pegasus, and Johann Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations: Alpha Andromedae (Œ± And) and Delta Pegasi (Œ¥ Peg). When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the latter designation dropped from use.Bayer‚Äôs Uranometria and Bayer letters The star bore the traditional names Alpheratz ( Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2017 -Alpheratz ) or Alpherat and Sirrah deriving from the Arabic name, ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ \\"the navel of the mare\\". (ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ© alone is ). The word horse reflects the star's historical placement in Pegasus. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Alpheratz for this star. Another term for this star used by medieval astronomers writing in Arabic was ÿ±ÿßÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿ© rƒÅs al-mar'a al- musalsala \\"the head of the woman in chains\\", the chained woman here being Andromeda. Other Arabic names include al-kaff al-kha·∏çƒ´b and kaff al-na·π£ƒ´r. In the Hindu lunar zodiac, this star, together with the other stars in the Great Square of Pegasus (Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ Pegasi), makes up the nakshatras of P≈´rva BhƒÅdrapadƒÅ and Uttara BhƒÅdrapadƒÅ. In Chinese, (), meaning wall, refers to an asterism consisting of Œ± Andromedae and Œ≥ Pegasi. Consequently, the Chinese name for Œ± Andromedae itself is (, .) It is also known as one of the \\"Three Guides\\" that mark the prime meridian of the heavens, the other two being Beta Cassiopeiae and Gamma Pegasi. It was believed to bless those born under its influence with honour and riches. System The radial velocity of a star away from or towards the observer can be determined by measuring the red shift or blue shift of its spectrum. The American astronomer Vesto Slipher made a series of such measurements from 1902 to 1904 and discovered that the radial velocity of Œ± Andromedae varied periodically. He concluded that it was in orbit in a spectroscopic binary star system with a period of about 100 days. A preliminary orbit was published by Hans Ludendorff in 1907, and a more precise orbit was later published by Robert Horace Baker. The fainter star in the system was first resolved interferometrically by Xiaopei Pan and his coworkers during 1988 and 1989, using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory, California, United States. This work was published in 1992. Because of the difference in luminosity between the two stars, its spectral lines were not observed until the early 1990s, in observations made by Jocelyn Tomkin, Xiaopei Pan, and James K. McCarthy between 1991 and 1994 and published in 1995. The two stars are now known to orbit each other with a period of 96.7 days. The larger, brighter star, called the primary, has a spectral type of B8IVpMnHg, a mass of approximately 3.6 solar masses, a surface temperature of about 13,800 K, and, measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 200 times the Sun's. Its smaller, fainter companion, the secondary, has a mass of approximately 1.8 solar masses and a surface temperature of about 8,500 K, and, again measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 10 times the Sun's. It is an early-type A star whose spectral type has been estimated as A3V. =Chemical peculiarities= In 1906, Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall reported that Œ± Andromedae had a number of unusual lines in its spectrum. In 1914, Baxandall pointed out that most of the unusual lines came from manganese, and that similar lines were present in the spectrum of Œº Leporis. In 1931, W. W. Morgan identified 12 additional stars with lines from manganese appearing in their spectra. Many of these stars were subsequently identified as part of the group of mercury-manganese stars, a class of chemically peculiar stars which have an excess of elements such as mercury, manganese, phosphorus, and gallium in their atmospheres. , ¬ß3.4. In the case of Œ± Andromedae, the brighter primary star is a mercury-manganese star which, as well as the elements already mentioned, has excess xenon. In 1970, Georges Michaud suggested that such chemically peculiar stars arose from radiative diffusion. According to this theory, in stars with unusually calm atmospheres, some elements sink under the force of gravity, while others are pushed to the surface by radiation pressure., ¬ß4. This theory has successfully explained many observed chemical peculiarities, including those of mercury- manganese stars., ¬ß4. =Variability of primary= Œ± Andromedae has been reported to be slightly variable, but observations from 1990 to 1994 found its brightness to be constant to within less than 0.01 magnitude. However, Adelman and his co-workers have discovered, in observations made between 1993 and 1999 and published in 2002, that the mercury line in its spectrum at 398.4 nm varies as the primary rotates. This is because the distribution of mercury in its atmosphere is not uniform. Applying Doppler imaging to the observations allowed Adelman et al. to find that it was concentrated in clouds near the equator. Subsequent Doppler imaging studies, published in 2007, showed that these clouds drift slowly over the star's surface. Observation Andromeda constellation. Œ± Andromedae, labeled Sirrah, is at the lower right of the constellation, bordering Pegasus. The location of Œ± Andromedae in the sky is shown on the left. It can be seen by the naked eye and is theoretically visible at all latitudes north of 60¬∞ S. During evening from August to October, it will be high in the sky as seen from the northern midlatitudes. Optical companion The binary system described above has an optical visual companion, discovered by William Herschel on July 21, 1781.See p.140, entry 32 in Designated as ADS 94 B in the Aitken Double Star Catalogue, it is a G-type star with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 10.8. Although by coincidence it appears near to the other two stars in the sky, it's much more distant from Earth; the parallax observed by Gaia place this star more than 1,300 light years away.

Bhimsingh and written by Javar Seetharaman. The film stars Gemini Ganesh, Savitri Ganesh and Kamal Haasan. It revolves around a couple ‚Äî a wealthy zamindar's son and a farmer's daughter ‚Äî who are separated due to circumstances, while their innocent son is forced to grow up in an orphanage. Kalathur Kannamma, inspired by the film Nobody's Child was originally directed by T. Prakash Rao who left due to creative differences, resulting in Bhimsingh taking over. It was the debut film of Kamal Haasan. The film's soundtrack was composed by R. Sudharsanam. Kalathur Kannamma was released on 12 August 1960. The film was critically acclaimed, with Haasan's performance being singled out. It was also commercially successful, running for over 100 days in theatres. It won the Certificate of Merit by the Government of India, and the President's Gold Medal award for Haasan. The film was remade in Telugu as Mooga Nomu, in Hindi as Main Chup Rahungi (with Bhimsingh returning as director), and in Sinhala as Mangalika.  Plot  Rajalingam is the only son of Ramalingam, the zamindar of Kalathur. Kannamma is the daughter of Murugan, a farmer of the same place. On the zamindar advice, Murugan sends his daughter to Madras for higher education. While returning from Madras, Kannamma meets Raja in the train. Noticing her respect and awe for the zamindar, Raja calls himself an electrician visiting the palace. They fall in love. A few days later, Kannamma learns the truth and to reassure her, Raja marries her secretly in a temple. Two days later, Raja has to go abroad for higher studies. During his absence, Ramalingam learns of the marriage and orders Kannamma to forget his son. Moved by the zamindar feelings, Kannamma promises never to mention their marriage to anyone. Kannamma is now in the family way. Ramalingam arranges for the stay of Murugan and Kannamma in a nearby town, Sevalpatti. Murugan, who is ashamed of Kannamma's love affair, leaves Kannamma's newborn son in an orphanage and lies that the child was stillborn. They both decide to leave the place and settle in Bangalore. When Raja returns, he learns that Kannamma had left Kalathur. His inquiries in Sevalpatti lead him to believe that Kannamma had led an immoral life. Grief- stricken, he travels from place to place to forget Kannamma and takes to drinking as a last resort. In Bangalore, he encounters Kannamma in a dancer's house where she had come to teach the dancer's daughter. Her presence in the house and reticence to Raja's questions strengthens his belief that Kannamma is a woman of ill repute and in disgust, he returns home. Kannamma's son Selvam grows up into an intelligent boy and is living in the orphanage in Sevalpatti. Murugan visits the orphanage and on meeting Selvam, decides to shift to Sevalpatti to be near him. Kannamma becomes a teacher in Selvam's school and feels attracted to him. She invites him to stay with her but he refuses as he has to look after Mani, a lame orphan living with him. Raja is invited to Sevalpatti by Singaram, a rich merchant who wants to marry his daughter Maduram to him, to preside over a school function. Raja takes a fascination for Selvam who acts in the school play. After the play ends, he encounters Kannamma again and orders the headmistress to dismiss her. Mani is critically ill and Selvam turns to Raja for help. Raja brings a doctor who is unable to save Mani. Raja takes Selvam with him to the palace. At Selvam's insistence, he stops drinking and to give him a mother, decides to marry Maduram. A seriously ill Murugan confesses to Kannamma that her child is not dead and reveals the identity of Selvam. Kannamma tries to contact Selvam but does not find him in the orphanage. The news shocks Murugan and to soothe his nerves, they move back to Kalathur. In the local temple, Kannamma meets Selvam and tells him that she is his mother. On learning from him that Raja is bringing him up and is marrying shortly to find him a mother, she asks him not to mention anything about her to Raja. Maduram learns from Selvam that he is the son of Raja, after which Singaram insists on a written undertaking that the properties of Raja would go to the children of Maduram only. The news of this conflict spreads in the village. On learning this, Murugan rushes to the palace to own the boy but collapses near the palace gate. Kannamma, who has followed, takes Selvam and tries to move away when she is intercepted by Raja who demands the boy back. Raja refuses to believe that Selvam is Kannamma's son and abuses Kannamma for her shameless life. Ramalingam observes that even in such a humiliating situation, Kannamma is silent and does not breathe a word about her promise to him. He is moved and acknowledges her as his daughter-in-law. Selvam is united with his parents, and Raja's marriage with Maduram is cancelled.  Cast  * Gemini Ganesh as Rajalingam * Savithri Ganesh as Kannamma * Kamal Haasan as Selvam * T. S.

Meiyappan in producing films for AVM Productions, his sons Saravanan, Murugan, Kumaran discussed producing one on their own with his son-in-law Arun Veerappan. Their mother Rajeswari told Meiyappan about this, and he gave his consent. The first story the brothers discussed was Maanam Periyadhu, but it did not shape up well. Unwilling to make a half-baked story as their inaugural production, Saravanan continued searching. Vellaichaami, an ex AVM employee, told Saravanan that Javar Seetharaman had been discussing a story with Meiyappan. Saravanan inquired further and learned that the story was called Pattuvum Kittuvum. However, Meiyappan told Seetharaman that while the story was good, AVM could not film it. When Saravanan and his brothers learned that Seetharaman was in discussions with another production company, they ran to Meiyappan and told him that they were interested in Seetharaman's story; to their relief, Meiyappan revealed that Seetharaman would be visiting him that afternoon. After Seetharaman realised that Saravanan and his brothers were interested, he willingly gave them his story, which evolved into Kalathur Kannamma. Impressed with T. Prakash Rao's work in Amara Deepam (1956) and Uthama Puthiran (1958), Saravanan and his brothers considered he would be best to direct Kalathur Kannamma. This decision was questioned, given that AVM had its own \\"director unit\\" of which Prakash Rao was not a part. Though AVM paid its directors salaries ranging from to , Prakash Rao charged ‚Äîtwice as much. Meiyappan, not wanting to be an obstacle to his sons' enthusiasm, approved Prakash Rao's salary. Despite Saravanan's desire, the credit of producing the film was given to Meiyappan, Kumaran, and Arun Veerappan. The story by Seetharaman was loosely adapted from two sources: the play The Forgotten Factor by the Moral Rearmament Army, and the film Nobody's Child. Cinematography was handled by T. Muthuswamy, editing by S. Surya, and art direction by H. Shantaram. S. P.

Sara told Rajeswari that Haasan had come to meet Meiyappan as he aspired to become an actor; Haasan was eventually taken by Saravanan to Meiyappan, who asked him to act like Irani. Impressed with Haasan's performance in the audition, Meiyappan decided to replace Irani with him. Though Saravanan protested as Irani had already been already booked for the role and paid an advance of , Meiyappan remained adamant as he felt Haasan was fresher and brighter than Irani. T. S. Balaiah was cast as the zamindar Ramalingam, S. V.

When it was decided to reshoot parts of the song, the mangoes were no longer in the trees since the season had ended. Hence, it was decided to reshoot the necessary scenes with fake mangoes hanging from the trees. The first shot filmed on Haasan was a scene featuring Kannamma feeding him upma. The song \\"Ammavum Neeye Appavum Neeye\\", picturised on Selvam, was recorded with three minutes duration, but Prakash Rao filmed its video to be only one-and-a-half minutes long. Meiyappan insisted to shoot the entire song so that Selvam could be established, and reshoot other scenes he was not satisfied with. Prakash Rao felt Meiyappan was interfering creatively and expressed his desire to quit the film, although up to nearly had been canned. Though Meiyappan was hesitant, Prakash Rao convinced him and left. AVM later hired A. Bhimsingh, under whose direction the film was completed. Although Bhimsingh offered to retain Prakash Rao's name in the credits, he declined. The final length of the film was .  Soundtrack  The music of the film was composed by R. Sudharsanam, while the lyrics were penned by Kannadasan, Kothamangalam Subbu, Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam, M. K. Athmanathan and T. K. Sundara Vathiyar. For the song \\"Arugil Vanthaal\\", Kannadasan came up with 56 or 58 pallavis, of which eight were finalised. The song \\"Aadatha Manamum\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Gourimanohari. The soundtrack received positive response, with the number \\"Ammavum Neeye\\" being singled out for praise.  Release and reception  Kalathur Kannamma was released on 12 August 1960, and received mostly positive reviews. On 11 September 1960, Ananda Vikatan praised Kamal Haasan's performance and described Kalathur Kannamma as one of the best films in Tamil to that point. The Madras-based film magazine Movieland said, \\"A new star rises on the movie horizon\\". The article by film journalist, K. Vasudevan, praised the performance of Haasan. The film was a major commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil ‚Äì Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film in 1961, and Haasan's performance earned him the President's Gold Medal.  Other versions  Kalathur Kannamma was dubbed in Telugu as Mavoori Ammayi, which was released on 20 October 1960. The film was also remade in the same language as Mooga Nomu (1969). Bhimsingh later remade the film in Hindi as Main Chup Rahungi (1962), where \\"Ammavum Neeye\\" was re-used as \\"Tumhi Ho Mata\\". The film was also remade in Sinhala as Mangalika (1963), while the Hindi version was remade as Udarata Menike the same year.  In other media  In Udan Pirappu (1993), Goundamani as a beggar sings \\"Ammavum Neeye\\" as \\"Mummy-um Neeye\\". In Kaathala Kaathala (1998), the footage of \\"Ammavum Neeye\\" will be shown in the title credits and the young Haasan gets transformed into elder Haasan, he and Prabhu Deva along with children is seen singing this song to a garbage bin.

It was then merged with Maestro, which is owned by MasterCard. History Switch was launched in 1988 by Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland as a multifunction cheque guarantee and cash card. The brand was merged with Maestro, an international debit card brand owned by Mastercard, at the end of 2002. This merger was referred to as the \\"penguin wedding,\\" due to its distinctive advertisements of penguins in different international settings created by Joel Veitch. Since then, Switch has been out of circulation and banks migrated customers from Switch to Maestro. The deal was announced in August 2002. The merger was also intended to increase the acceptance of foreign Maestro cards in the United Kingdom. However, despite the Maestro brand name, point of sale transactions in the United Kingdom were still processed by Switch Card Services Limited, later S2 Card Services Limited. Consequently, many retailers who advertise that they accept Maestro could only accept cards issued in the United Kingdom, i.e. former Switch cards that supported both UK Domestic Maestro (UKDM) and Maestro International functionality. In March 2011, Mastercard aligned UK Domestic Maestro with the standard international Maestro proposition, ending its status as a separate card scheme. This change also led to the discontinuation of Solo debit cards. Switch/Maestro cards issued by certain banks carried an issue number on the bottom of the card corresponding to the number of times a card had been issued on a particular account. This was usually because the current account number the card was linked to actually formed a large part of the card number, and therefore the card number could not be readily changed in case of loss or the card expiring. The term \\"Switch\\" was commonly used to refer to debit cards in the United Kingdom; however, the brand is largely forgotten now. In January 2009, First Direct and HSBC discontinued the use of Maestro card, issuing Visa Debit cards to new customers, and a gradual roll out throughout 2009 to existing customers. In September of the same year, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, both owned by National Australia Bank, started the process of replacing the Maestro card with a Debit Mastercard for their current accounts, except for the Readycash and Student accounts, for which the Maestro card continued to be issued. Likewise, in the same month the then Royal Bank of Scotland Group (Europe's largest debit card issuer which includes the Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Coutts and Ulster Bank) switched from Maestro to Visa Debit, a process that would take two years to complete.Your card - RBS - The Royal Bank of Scotland The Royal Bank of ScotlandNatwest Your card National Westminster BankVisa Debit Ulster Bank External links Category:Debit cards Category:1988 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2002 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Switch (debit card)"},{"id":"859152","text":"The Big Sandy River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 8, 2011 tributary of the Tennessee River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Tennessee and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The Big Sandy rises about northwest of Lexington, in the same vicinity as two other important rivers of West Tennessee, the Beech River and the Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River. From near its source downstream, much of the Big Sandy River has been channelized. It crosses into Carroll County near the community of Yuma. In Carroll County, it passes slightly east of the town of Bruceton. Turning somewhat northeast, it crosses into Benton County. The former channel (prior to channelization) of the Big Sandy forms several miles of the boundary between Benton County and Henry County. The lower Big Sandy is impounded by the Kentucky Dam project of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); it forms the biggest single embayment on Kentucky Lake. The head of the embayment is the site of the town of Big Sandy and nearby is a major \\"dewatering area\\". This is an almost flat area (superficially resembling a tidal flat) which is flooded or not, depending on TVA's assessment of a proper level for Kentucky Lake, taking into consideration flood control, navigation, electrical power needs, and recreation (in that order, according to the 1933 act establishing the Authority). Another, even larger, dewatering area is maintained by the help of an auxiliary dam on a tributary, West Sandy Creek. Despite the extensive channelization activity, much of what the river must have been prior to this can be seen in the wetlands surrounding it near the Interstate 40 bridge and also along State Route 69 between Camden and Paris.  Mercury contamination  TWRA Contaminant Advisory The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has been collecting data on possible contaminates in the numerous fish species in the Big Sandy River and embayment. These studies started in 2009 and continued through 2014. After which an advisory was issued including all of the Big Sandy and its embayment on the Tennessee River. The advisory states that Largemouth bass and spotted bass can have mercury contamination, and that children, expecting mothers, and mothers who are breastfeeding should not consume them at all. The advisory goes on to state that all others should limit their consumption to these bass species to once per month. Mercury can have serious effects on the development of children. Mercury contamination is contained in the muscular tissue of the fish, instead of the fat tissue like other contaminants. These larger predatory fish like the Largemouth and spotted bass become more contaminated, by biomagnifcation, as the mercury moves up the food chain. Producer organisms become contaminated, then the fish that eat them can become 10 times as contaminated as the level of the food chain below them, this contamination increases in strength as it moves up the food chain to these top predators in the environment. The contamination levels in other fish like the crappie, blue gill, shellcrackers, and catfish were all listed as safe to consume. After the advisory was posted about the bass contamination, several members of the public expressed concerns to the TDEC at a public meeting, about possible contamination in the backwater area of the West Sandy Creek at Springville, TN. After the tested was completed an advisory was issued that Bass and Crappie in the backwater area, locally known as the Springville Bottom, had high levels of mercury contamination.

History  C. F. Holder in St. Nicholas Magazine, 1886 The first records of flea performances were from watchmakers who were demonstrating their metalworking skills. In 1578, Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an ‚Äúextraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas‚Äù on Regent Street, London. Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. At least one genuine flea circus still performs (at the annual Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.  Techniques with real fleas  Fleas typically live only for a few months. They are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold wire around their neck.National Geographic, May 1988. Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a Ferris wheel.Hund, Katze, Maus. 10 February 2010 VOX There are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.  Techniques without real fleas  Some flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the \\"acts\\", with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as \\"Humbug\\" flea circuses. Michael Bentine gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show, It's a Square World in the 1960s.

According to Benedetto Croce he was born in 1575, while other sources have February 1566. In Venice he began to write poetry. Later he returned to Naples to serve as a courtier under the patronage of Don Marino II Caracciolo, prince of Avellino, to whom he dedicated his idyll L‚ÄôAretusa (1618). By the time of his death he had reached the rank of \\"count\\" Conte di Torrone. Basile's earliest known literary production is from 1604 in the form of a preface to the Vaiasseide of his friend the Neapolitan writer Giulio Cesare Cortese. The following year his villanella Smorza crudel amore was set to music and in 1608 he published his poem Il Pianto della Vergine. He is chiefly remembered for writing the collection of Neapolitan fairy tales titled Lo cunto de li cunti overo lo trattenemiento de peccerille (Neapolitan for \\"The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones\\"), also known as Il Pentamerone published posthumously in two volumes by his sister Adriana in Naples, Italy in 1634 and 1636 under the pseudonym Gian Alesio Abbatutis. It later became known as the Pentamerone. Although neglected for some time, the work received a great deal of attention after the Brothers Grimm praised it highly as the first national collection of fairy tales.

They have been built at urban interface areas in Belfast, Derry, Portadown and elsewhere. The stated purpose of the peace lines is to minimise inter-communal violence between Catholics (most of whom are nationalists who self-identify as Irish) and Protestants (most of whom are unionists who self-identify as British). The peace lines range in length from a few hundred yards to over three miles (5 km). They may be made of iron, brick and/or steel and are up to high. Some have gates in them (sometimes staffed by police) that allow passage during daylight but are closed at night. The majority of peace walls are located in Belfast, but they also exist in Derry, Portadown and Lurgan. History Although temporary peace walls were built in Belfast in the 1920s (in Ballymacarett) and 1930s (in Sailortown), the first peace lines of \\"the Troubles\\" era were built in 1969, following the outbreak of civil unrest and the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. They were initially built as temporary structures, but due to their effective nature they have become wider, longer, more numerous and more permanent. Originally few in number, they have multiplied over the years, from 18 in the early 1990s to at least 59 as of late 2017; in total they stretch over , with most located in Belfast. They have been increased in both height and number since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Three-quarters of Belfast's estimated 97 peace lines and related structures (such as gates and closed roads) are in the north and west of the city. These are also the poorer and more disadvantaged areas of Belfast. 67% of deaths during the sectarian violence occurred within 550 yards (500 metres) of one of these \\"interface structures\\". In recent years, they have even become locations for tourism. Black taxis now take groups of tourists around Belfast's peace lines, trouble spots and famous murals. The most prominent peace lines in the past few years separate the nationalist Falls Road and unionist Shankill Road areas of West Belfast; the nationalist Short Strand from the unionist Cluan Place areas of East Belfast, the unionist Corcrain Road and the nationalist Orbins Drive in Portadown and the unionist Fountain Estate and nationalist Bishop Street area of Derry. In 2008, a public discussion began about how and when the peace lines could be removed. While, on 1 September 2011, Belfast City Council agreed to develop a strategy regarding the removal of peace walls, a study was released in 2012 indicating that 69% of residents believe that the peace walls are still necessary because of potential violence. At the end of 2011, several local community initiatives resulted in the opening of a number of interface structures for a trial period. In January 2012, the International Fund for Ireland launched a Peace Walls funding programme to support local communities who want to work towards beginning to remove the peace walls. In May 2013, the Northern Ireland Executive committed to the removal of all peace lines by mutual consent by 2023. In 2017, the Belfast Interface Project published a study entitled 'Interface Barriers, Peacelines & Defensive Architecture' that identified 97 separate walls, barriers and interfaces in Belfast. A history of the development of these structures can be found at the Peacewall Archive. In September 2017, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice published its Interface Programme, established to deliver the commitment made by the Northern Ireland Executive to remove all Interface structures by 2023 under the Together: Building a United Community Strategy. In September 2019, a series of events were held in Belfast to mark the anniversary of 50 years of peace lines in the city. This included an international conference alongside other events to discuss the past and possible future of the peace lines.

The design was the winner of a 1974 competition held by the City of Toronto Flag Design Committee. The previous flag had consisted of the city's coat of arms on a white and blue background, which was considered to be overly simplistic by then mayor William Dennison. When several municipalities in the Toronto area were in the process of amalgamating, the Toronto City Council launched a competition in 1997 for new designs from the public, but the council did not approve any of the public submissions. During the review process, De Santis suggested minor modifications to his original 1974 flag design. This revised version beat out a design recommended by then councillor Brad Duguid in a November 1999 council vote to become the current flag. Description The flag displays the twin towers of the Toronto City Hall on a blue background, with the red maple leaf of the flag of Canada at its base, representing the Council Chamber at the base of the towers. The shape of the space above and between the towers suggests the letter 'T', the city's initial. A variation of this flag is used by Toronto Fire Services fireboat William Lyon Mackenzie. The marine ensign consists of the city's flag in the upper canton, with a lifebuoy on a two-tone blue background. Flag of Metropolitan Toronto Flag of the former municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1954‚Äì1998) From 1954 to 1998 (pre-amalgamation), the old city of Toronto and surrounding municipalities formed an upper tier level of municipal government known as Metropolitan Toronto.

Course The river rises at the base of the Cumberland Plateau, just southwest of Monterey in eastern Putnam County, with the convergence of several smaller streams that drop off the Plateau. Several of these headwater streams are impounded at the Plateau's edge, including one which forms Monterey Lake. The river then winds its way southward, slicing a broad valley in an otherwise hilly section of the Eastern Highland Rim.

Retrieved: 8 June 2012. Tributaries that enter river's western bank include Plum Creek and Cherry Creek, near the Yankeetown community, and Mill Creek, near the river's headwaters. History According to Goodspeed's History of White County, the Calfkiller River is likely named after a Cherokee chief who lived in the valley when the first European-American settlers arrived in the area around 1800, following the American Revolutionary War.Goodspeed's History of White County , 1887.

In the years before the Civil War, an iron works and a cotton mill operated along the banks of the river in the vicinity of the current TN-111 bridge.Arthur Weir Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland , 1973. Accessed at TNGenWeb.org, 8 June 2012. A number of Civil War skirmishes were fought along the Calfkiller River. On August 9, 1863, Union forces under Charles Minty attacked a Confederate scouting detachment under George Dibrell near Wildcat Creek, eventually scattering the Rebels after intense fighting. Another skirmish occurred on November 30 of that year, when a band of Confederate guerrillas unsuccessfully ambushed a detachment of the U.S. First Tennessee Cavalry at Yankeetown. On February 22, 1864, a band of Confederates under John Hughes attacked a detachment of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry along the river, in what became known as the \\"Battle of Dug Hill.\\" Hughes reportedly captured and executed over a dozen federals.James B. Jones, Jr., \\"Fevers Ran High: The Civil War in the Cumberland,\\" Rural Life and Culture in the Upper Cumberland (University Press of Kentucky, 2004), pp. 86-98. Confederate guerrilla leader Champ Ferguson, who lived in the Calfkiller Valley, is buried in France Cemetery, along the banks of the river near the Putnam-White county line. In 1902, the Sparta Light and Power Company built a small waterwheel-powered electric plant just downstream from Sparta. After this plant burned in 1907, it was replaced by a more modern plant that used a concrete dam to divert water through a flume to a powerhouse located downstream. The plant operated until the 1930s, when the Tennessee Valley Authority began providing electricity to the area from major hydroelectric projects.Arthur Weir Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland, 1973, pp. 63-66.

Biography Born into an intellectual Chinese family in Hong Kong, with ancestry from Taishan Guangdong, Yu was educated at home for many years before attending Wah Yan College Hong Kong, a prominent Jesuit high school in Hong Kong. In 1938, at the age of sixteen, he was admitted to the University of Hong Kong, where he studied in the arts program as a Government Scholar. In 1941, shortly after the Pacific War had broken out, Yu served with British Naval Intelligence and was commissioned as an officer in the Intelligence Corps of the Army of the Republic of China. In 1945, Yu was awarded a Victory Scholarship by the Government of Hong Kong to continue his studies in England. He studied at Merton College, Oxford from 1946 to 1948, and later passed his Bar Examination. Jobless and almost penniless, Yu was forced to find himself a profession. Within a 10-month period, he familiarised himself with all the \\"niceties\\" of the English common law, studying in the Bar Library at Lincoln's Inn. In 1949, he passed the bar exam of England and Wales and practised briefly as a chancery barrister in London. In 1950, Yu moved to Malaya for a short period to work in his uncle's firm Shook Lin & Bok. He soon went back to Hong Kong, and in 1951 became the first Chinese person to be appointed Crown Counsel of that British colony. Yu resigned in 1953 and commenced a private practice. He soon built up a sterling reputation as an advocate, and by the mid-1960s he had already become the top criminal lawyer in town. It was also during this time he helped to establish the first law school in Hong Kong, \\"The Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong\\". For that, he received an Honorary LLD degree from the University of Hong Kong. In the 1970s, Yu was offered a judgeship on the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, an invitation he declined. Two similar offers were made during the decade. Yu declined both on the grounds of the discriminatory employment terms. Yu was also known for his refusal to apply to become Queen's Counsel, a mark of distinction envied by many practitioners in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and in many other Commonwealth countries. In 1983, after thirty years of private practice, Yu decided to retire. He became an autobiography author and story-teller, and has published two volumes of memoirs and stories since. He became a life member of the Hong Kong bar association in 1994. He is a cousin of Yong Pung How, former Chief Justice of Singapore, and his younger daughter is married to the younger son of Sir Ti Liang Yang, former Chief Justice of Hong Kong. Yu died on 12 January 2019.

Life  She was born in Halberstadt, in the Prussian province of Saxony, the daughter of , General of the Infantry in the Prussian Army, and his wife Jenny, n√©e von Gustedt (1843-1903). Her maternal grandmother, the writer Jenny von Gustedt (1811-1890), had been an illegitimate daughter of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother who was King of Westphalia, and his mistress Diana Rabe von Pappenheim. Lily Braun's great-niece, Marianne von Kretschmann married Richard von Weizs√§cker, President of Germany from 1984 to 1994. Raised according to the Prussian virtues of order and discipline at changing places throughout her father's military career, she nevertheless developed a direct and open personality, encouraged in particular by her grandmother . She was considered to be highly ambitious and her family provided her with a broad education by numerous private teachers. From an early age on, she began to question her parents' bourgeois values as influenced by Lutheranism and Calvinism as well the position of women in Prussian society. When her father retired in 1890, she had to establish a sustainable livelihood herself. From 1893 Lily Braun was briefly married to , a professor of philosophy at the Frederick William University in Berlin, who was associated with the Social Democratic Party without however being a member. Together with him she was involved in the ethical movement, which sought to establish a system of morality in place of the traditional religions. Also, she became concerned with the ideas of socialism and the feminist movement, working as a journalist for the feminist newspaper ' (The Women's Movement) issued by Minna Cauer. After her first husband's death, she married in 1896 Heinrich Braun, who was a Social Democratic politician and a publicist. The couple had one son, , a highly talented poet who was killed at the Western Front in the last months of World War I. Lily Braun joined the SPD at an early age and became one of the leaders of the German feminist movement. Within the party, she belonged to the revisionist opposition within the SPD who did not believe in the theories of historical materialism but in the gradual adaptation of society, rather than a socialist revolution. Her attempts to mediate between proletarian and bourgeois feminist circles were heavily criticised; likewise, her proposals on reconciliation of family and working life were rejected. Her answers to the woman question were especially slammed by socialist authors like Clara Zetkin, while middle-class circles considered her ideas too radical. Like her fellow political activist Helene St√∂cker, Lily Braun was strongly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche; she and her husband wanted the SPD to focus on the development of personality and individuality instead of levelling everybody. Women should have their own personality and should not have to be only regarded as (future) mothers and wives. She wanted economic freedom for women and advocated new types of personal relations up to the abolition of legal marriage. Deeply concerned about the fate of her son, Lily Braun died in Zehlendorf (today part of Berlin) from the consequences of a stroke at the age of 51, in the midst of World War I. After her death, her second husband Heinrich Braun married Julie Braun-Vogelstein,Guide to the Julie Braun- Vogelstein Collection, 1743-1971AR 25034 / MF 473 who was also the editor of Lily Braun's Collected Works.

Selby Abbey, England Sulgrave Manor, England George Washington bookplate Durham Cathedral cloisters, England Maidstone, England Godfrey Washington's monument in Little St Mary's, Cambridge Washington University Seal The coat of arms of the Washington family was first used to identify the family in the 12th century, when the Washington family took possession of Washington Old Hall in County Durham, England before making its way to the Colony of Virginia in the 17th century with George Washington's great-grand-father. The design (three red stars over two horizontal red bars on a white field) has been used since 1938 as the basis for the coat of arms and flag of the District of Columbia. It is also found on the Purple Heart. These elements have also been said to have inspired the \\"stars and stripes\\" design of the Flag of the United States. However, despite some visual similarity, there is \\"little evidence\\" or \\"no evidence whatsoever\\" to support the claimed connection. The Digital Encyclopedia of George Washington, published by the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon, calls it an \\"enduring myth\\" backed by \\"no discernible evidence.\\" Instead, the story seems to have originated in the 1876 play Washington: A Drama in Five Acts, by the English poet Martin Farquhar Tupper, and was further popularized through repetition in the children's magazine St. Nicholas. History The Washington family traces its roots to Sir William de Hertburn who was granted the lordship of Wessyngton in northeast England and adopted the name of the estate. The early arms showed a lion rampant in 1203 and evolved dramatically over the next century and a half through alliances and acquisitions. In 1346, a similar design is recorded for Sir William de Wessyngton‚Äôs great grandson with the two horizontal bars below three mullets though the colors are reversed. At the end of the 14th century, the current design is recorded as being used by the family. The family scattered in various parts of the country over the next century. One branch of the family would move to the Colony of Virginia settled in Northamptonshire, England. In 1592, Robert Cook, Clarenceux King of Arms confirms upon Lawrence Washington of Sulgrave Manor the current coat of arms. Mount Vernon - Coat of arms In a letter dated 7 December 1791, George Washington received the confirmation from Sir Isaac Heard, Garter Principal King of Arms of the College of Arms in London. He responds that \\"the arms are the same that are held here by the family.\\" The President used the coat of arms in many places around his home Mount Vernon including on several personal items as well as on the livery uniforms of his servants as this was a common practice prior to the American Revolution among wealthy plantation owners. Variations and similar arms Some authorities in the twelfth century displayed the arms with the colours reversed (gules two bars argent, in chief three mullets of the second). An almost identical coat of arms was used by the Le Moyne family, who were described as landowners at Grafham in Huntingdonshire in the reign of Henry II. Their arms was: \\"Argent, two bars Sable, in chief three mullets of the second\\", with only the colour of the mullets and bars being different. The Washington University in St. Louis seal, developed in 1896, uses elements from George Washington's coat of arms. Other uses Washington's coat of arms was in inspiration for the Flag of Washington, D.C.. The coat of arms is also on the Purple Heart decoration awarded by the United States Armed Forces.

The window is believed to have been moved from what was the chapel of Durham College, Oxford. Durham College was created for the training of Benedictine monks from Durham Abbey. Durham College was disestablished by Henry VIII. Sir Thomas Pope purchased the site in 1555 and used it for the creation of Trinity College. *The Washington Window in Selby Abbey, in the British market town of Selby, contains a variant of the Washington coat of arms in the original 14th-century stained glass. It is thought to be a benefaction to the abbey to commemorate John Wessington, Prior of Durham (1416-1446). The arms are distinguished from the usual Washington arms by having pierced mullets. *The Washington coat of arms can also be seen at the parish church in Garsdon, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, where a branch of the family moved in Tudor times.

The building has a distinctive arched roof with a 64-metre span - the second-largest railway station roof span in the United Kingdom, and was granted Grade II* listed building status in 1963. After 89 years as a railway terminus, it closed to passengers in May 1969. It was renovated as an exhibition centre formerly known as the G-Mex Centre in 1982 and was Manchester's primary music concert venue until the construction of the Manchester Arena. After renovation the venue reverted to its former name Manchester Central in 2007. The Complex is to become a temporary field hospital for non-critical coronavirus patients, or Fangcang Hospital, part of a network of temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals.  History  = Manchester Central railway station = An illustrative image of the old Manchester Central railway station, dated 1905. The complex was originally Manchester Central railway station, one of the city's main railway terminals. Designed by Sir John Fowler, the station was opened in July 1880 by the Cheshire Lines Committee. The station served as the terminus for Midland Railway express trains to London St Pancras. The station's large arched roof ‚Äì a huge wrought-iron single-span arched roof, spanning , long and high ‚Äì was a noted piece of railway engineering and is the widest unsupported iron arch in Britain after the Barlow train shed at London St Pancras.

The building was renovated at a cost of ¬£30 million in 2008 by Manchester-based architects, Stephenson Bell. The first phase to create a foyer took from February to November 2008. The second phase, completed towards the end of 2009, included an extended foyer to the Grade ll listed Central Hall. The old smoked-glass structure was demolished and replaced by a flat-roofed, clear-glazed structure exposing more of the original architecture. The final phase, completed in September 2010, focused on the rear of the building. New event spaces were built and rooms refurbished to increase the venue's range and size of meeting and banqueting spaces.  Events  During its days as the G-MEX Centre, the venue was used for hosting rock concerts. Not long after its official opening, Factory Records used the venue for their Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Punk in the city, and included appearances by The Smiths, and Factory Records stalwarts New Order. James appeared in 1990, U2 in June 1992, Metallica in November 1992 on their The Black Album tour and The Cure in November 1992. G-Mex had a seating capacity of 9,500 for end stage concerts and 12,500 for standing events and stopped hosting concerts in 1997, with the last gig by Oasis in December. G-Mex was also the 2002 Commonwealth Games venue for gymnastics, weightlifting, judo and wrestling.

It was so named because a mint authorised by King Henry VIII was set up in Suffolk Place, a mansion house, in about 1543. The mint ceased to operate in the reign of Mary I and Suffolk Place was demolished in 1557.\\"Mint Street\\" in Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds.) (1983) The London Encyclopaedia: 521 In the late-17th and early-18th centuries, the area was known for offering protection against prosecution for debtors due to its legal status as a \\"liberty\\", or a jurisdictional interzone. History In 1550, the City of London acquired two manors from Edward VI's government. They comprised the former holding of Bermondsey Abbey on the west side of Borough High Street (see also King's Manor, Southwark) and that of the Archbishop of Canterbury on the east side . The charter retained the mansion and grounds of the Duke of Suffolk, known as Suffolk Place and Southwark Place that had been assigned to Edward's mother by Henry VIII. On the accession of Mary I she assigned it to the Archbishop of York for his London palace, and that diocese began to lease the estate for development, mainly of the highest density and poorest quality; the area became a rookery of slums. The 1550 charter's exemption from the City's control of the neighbouring manor created a separate jurisdiction, the Liberty of the Mint. \\"The Mint\\" therefore, became an Alsatia (so called after the area of Whitefriars), a haunt of criminals and fugitives. A map showing the Liberty of the Mint within Southwark. Such anomalous districts attracted particular denizens, and the Mint's primary population was debtors. Those in danger of being thrown into debtors' prison could hide in the Mint. Once there, debtors risked arrest if they were found outside of its boundary. Debt collectors (known as \\"duns\\") stood along the main roads out of the Mint to wait for suspected debtors. Sometimes they were bill collectors in the modern sense, and sometimes thugs who beat and seized the debtor. Inside the Mint, life was hard. Since debtors could not leave (except on Sunday, when no debts could be collected), they could not find employment to raise money to pay off their debts. Those who attempted to leave on Sundays to get money from friends or lenders were called \\"Sunday gentlemen\\", as they attempted to appear prosperous to hoodwink lenders. Debtors who went to the Mint frequently died of malnutrition or were murdered before raising enough money to escape. The Mint's geography was a factor in its poor living standard, as it was below the river's level and was a breeding ground for sewage- and water-borne maladies. Daniel Defoe describes life there for his heroine Moll Flanders in the novel of the same name. In 1723, the Mint lost its protected status as a result of The Mint in Southwark Act 1722 and at the same time, imprisonment for debts of less than ¬£50 was abolished, and many residents left without fear of arrest. The area was a slum into the 19th century. By that time, its reputation as a haunt for the poorest of the poor ensured that it had a lower standard of living than the rest of London. Elsewhere in 19th century London new roads were laid through slum areas to eliminate them, but Southwark Bridge Road, constructed in 1819 to Southwark Bridge, swerved around the western side of the Mint. In the later 19th century its reputation as one of London's worst rookeries was sustained when conditions there were exposed by the Rev Andrew Mearns in The Bitter Cry of Outcast London (1883) and by George R. Sims in How the Poor Live (1883). The scandal created by Mearns' and Sims' revelations prompted a Royal Commission in 1884‚Äì1885 but the destruction of the Mint was underway. From 1881 to 1886, associated with the construction of Marshalsea Road, the area was cleared of most of its slums, although even in 1899 some remnants of the rookery were still in place between Red Cross Street and Borough High Street.Jerry White (2007), London in the Nineteenth Century, 9‚Äì10, 58‚Äì60. The Mint is referred to by most 18th-century British satirists, including Alexander Pope in his Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot and, indirectly, by John Gay in Trivia. It is the refuge of the outlaw Jack Sheppard in William Harrison Ainsworth's novel Jack Sheppard (1839) and in the novel The System of the World by Neal Stephenson. The only remnant of the Mint is a street in the location named Mint Street.  See also  * The Marshalsea, a debtors' prison close to the Mint to the east.

Adults may reach a maximum length of 40 cm, but the usual size is around 25 cm.FishBase - Harpadon nehereus Etymology Illustration The origin of the term \\"Bombay duck\\" is uncertain. One popular etymology claims that the overpowering smell of the dried fish when transported by mail train (the Bombay Daak) led to the phrase \\"you smell like the Bombay Daak\\" in the days of the British Raj. However, the Oxford English Dictionary dates \\"Bombay duck\\" to at least 1850, two years before the first railroad in Bombay was constructed, making this explanation unlikely.duck, n.1. Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989; online version December 2011. Accessed 2 February 2012.IR History: Early Days - I. Indian Railways Fan Club website. Accessed 2 February 2012. According to local Bangladeshi stories, the term Bombay duck was first coined by Robert Clive, after he tasted a piece during his conquest of Bengal. He is said to have associated the pungent smell with that of the newspapers and mail which would come into the cantonments from Bombay. The term was later popularized among the British public by its appearance in Indian restaurants in the UK. In his 1829 book of poems and \\"Indian reminiscences\\", Sir Toby Rendrag (pseudonym) notes the \\"use of a fish nick-named 'Bombay Duck'\\"Toby Rendrag (sir, pseud.), Poems, original, lyrical, and satirical, containing Indian reminiscences of the late sir Toby Rendrag, Publ. 1829 W.

Clark, William Combe, Paddy Hew: a poem : from the brain of Timothy Tarpaulin, Printed for Whittingham and Arliss, 1815, 195 pages, page 86 Distribution and fisheries The Bombay duck lives in the tropical areas of the Indo-Pacific. The fish is also known as \\"strange fish\\" because of its discontinuous distribution along the Indian coast. It has been traditionally caught in the waters off Maharashtra in the Lakshadweep Sea, where it is an important item of the yearly catch. This fish is also caught in the Bay of Bengal and in the South China Sea, although in smaller numbers. The fish is sometimes dried before it is consumed. After drying, the odour of the fish is extremely powerful, and it is usually transported in air-tight containers. The Bombay duck is a popular food item in certain areas of India. Fresh fish are usually fried or cooked in curry.  International availability  Bombay duck drying in open air Dried Bombay duck for sale in a fish market, Maharashtra At one time, 13 tonnes of Bombay duck were eaten in the UK each year. Following the discovery of a batch of imported seafood contaminated by Salmonella in 1996, the European Commission (EC) prohibited fish imports from India other than from approved freezing and canning factories. As Bombay duck is not produced in a factory, this had the unintended consequence of banning the import of Bombay duck. After a campaign to \\"Save Bombay Duck\\", the Indian High Commission approached the EC about the ban, and the EC adjusted its regulations so that the fish can still be dried in the open air, but has to be packed in an \\"EC approved\\" packing station. A Birmingham wholesale merchant located a packing source in Mumbai, and the product became available again. Bombay duck is available fresh in Canada in cities with large Indian populations, such as Toronto and Montreal, and is generally known as bumla. Although mainly popular with Indians from Bengal, southern Gujarat, coastal Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka, it is increasingly consumed by the other South Asian populations, Bangladeshis in particular.

Dry-aged beef Hanging beef Dry aging beef at a steakhouse Dry-aged beef is beef that has been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is slaughtered and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip loins, rib eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, also known as a \\"hot box\\". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture. The process changes beef by two means. Firstly, moisture is evaporated from the muscle. The resulting process of desiccation creates a greater concentration of beef flavour and taste. Secondly, the beef's natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender beef. The process of dry-aging usually also promotes growth of certain fungal (mold) species on the external surface of the meat. This does not cause spoilage, but rather forms an external \\"crust\\" on the meat's surface, which is trimmed off when the meat is prepared for cooking. These fungal species complement the natural enzymes in the beef by helping to tenderize and increase the flavor of the meat. The genus Thamnidium, in particular, is known to produce collagenolytic enzymes which greatly contribute to the tenderness and flavor of dry-aged meat. Dry-aged beef is typically not sold by most supermarkets in the U.S. today, because it takes time and there is a significant loss of weight during the aging process. Dry-aging can take from 15 to 28 days, and typically up to a third or more of the weight is lost as moisture. This type of beef is served in higher-priced steakhouses and by select restaurants. Dry-aging can be done at home under refrigeration by three means: open air, with the presence of salt blocks, and with the use of a moisture permeable drybag to protect the meat while it is aging. Since the mid-2010s, some chefs have experimented with a \\"quick\\" or \\"cheat\\" dry-age by coating a cut of beef with ground koji (rice inoculated with Aspergillus oryzae) to simulate the effect of traditional dry- aging; the results are not quite the same, but can be achieved within 48 to 72 hours. The koji technique can also be applied to chicken and shrimp. When dry aging using a moisture permeable material, surface mold growth is not present, flavor and scent exchange within the refrigerated environment is not a concern, and trim loss of the outer hardened surface is measurably reduced. The flavor and texture profile of the beef is similar on all dimensions to the traditional open air dry-aged results. Historically, it was common to store mutton or beef joints at room temperature for extended periods; even after the invention of refrigeration hanging sides of beef in large coolers for a few weeks as part of the processing was standard. Wet-aged beef Wet-aged beef is beef that has typically been aged in a vacuum-sealed bag to retain its moisture. This is the dominant mode of aging beef in the U.S. and UK today. It is popular with producers, wholesalers and retailers because it takes less time: typically only a few days and there is no moisture loss, so any given piece of meat sold by weight will have a higher value than a dry aged piece where moisture loss is desired for taste at the expense of final weight. The beef is usually kept for a period of 4 to 10 days in wet aging. Modified- atmosphere packaging (MAP) is usually employed for the vacuum packaging of meat; typically between 60 and 80 percent oxygen to retain its appetizing color, with red meat such as beef needing a higher oxygen level than less vividly colored meat such as pork. The vacuum packed beef is stored at a temperature of 32 ¬∞F to 45 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C to 7.2 ¬∞C).

The IBA is a loose-knit organization with only one way to earn membership: ride one of the several rides the IBA certifies. The minimum is the Saddle Sore 1000 ‚Äì in 24 hours or less. Entry into the Iron Butt Rally is by lottery only and every lottery entry must be an Iron Butt Member first. History The Iron Butt Rally first ran in 1984 with 10 riders. From 1984 to 1987 the rally started from Montgomeryville Cycle Center near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Iron Butt was not held again until 1991 when it came under the management of the Iron Butt Association. While the basic format of the original rally remained, two important things changed: to ensure the quality of the event, the rally is run every other year, and the starting and ending points are rotated to different locations within the United States. 107 riders started and 89 finished the latest Iron Butt Rally, which ran in 2017. Beginning in 1993, shorter rides were arranged that lasted in duration from one to many days, and while the Iron Butt Rally is a large, organized event with a plotted course, the other rides are left up to the competitor to accomplish at their own accord. Some riders prefer to complete a ride solo, while some clubs have arranged rides in groups of up to 30 riders. But while the Rally is a monitored event, the riders of other events must monitor themselves. An example is the Saddle Sore 1000, where thorough documentation of the ride must be made, by collecting time-stamped gas and business receipts along the way, and by keeping a trip log recording mileage and location. These documents are then submitted by mail with a fee to the IBA, where it is then processed and an award given if the requirements are met. The Iron Butt Association has members around the world. Those in the UK run their own rally each year called the Brit Butt Rally., a 12 hr rally and Jorvik Rally a short 8 rally Riders from all over Europe, Norway, Middle East and Australia have entered. There is also a 12-hour teaser rally called the Brit Butt Light. Iron Butt UK has grown from 7 registered riders in 2005 to over 350 riders completing Iron Butt rides within the UK during 2009. Iron Butt UK also teamed up with the Royal British Legion Riders branch in organizing a 24-hour 1000 mile run with over 175 riders taking part. The previous world record was 152, however the UK riders were pipped to the post by another USA ride of over 400 riders. Currently IBA is headed by Michael J Kneebone, President, IBA. IBA Sanctioned Events The IBA suggests several types of long-distance rides to challenge riders. It is perhaps best known for the Iron Butt Rally, an organized event that is invitation only, through a raffle system. Additionally, the Iron Butt Association hosts the Saddle Sore 1000, the Bun Burner 1500, the Bun Burner Gold, the 50 cc Quest, the National Parks Tour Master Traveler Award, the coveted 10/10ths Challenge, the very exclusive 100K Club, and other longer themed rides taking place on different routes around the world. Besides the Iron Butt Rally, none of these rides are organized events, but rather individual endeavors planned and executed by individual riders on routes and at times they choose. =Iron Butt Rally= The Iron Butt Rally is a competitive motorcycle road rally held in the United States. It was first held in 1984, and beginning in 1991, now takes place in odd numbered years, usually in August. The rally lasts 11 days, and riders often travel over in that time. During the rally, entrants earn points by riding their motorcycles to various \\"bonus\\" locations in the U.S. and Canada. A bonus is a task or destination with a point value. To earn the points for a bonus, a rider must provide evidence by photographing an object or scene, purchasing a particular item, or by various other means specified by the organizers. The rally consists of one or more checkpoints, which may be located anywhere the United States, and one or more lists of bonuses with locations, times of availability (if limited), and varying point values. Each leg of the rally has its own bonus list, and only the bonuses for the leg currently being ridden are known to riders and can be earned. A bonus list typically contains far more bonuses than can be earned in the time allotted during a leg. This introduces a significant strategic element to the rally, since each rider must determine for him/herself which bonuses to attempt, and what route to use to reach them, while still reaching the next checkpoint before it closes. To be considered a finisher of the event, a rider must be present at each of the checkpoints within a specific time window, and must earn a minimum number of bonus points during the rally. Additional achievement levels (gold, silver, bronze) can be reached by earning more than the minimum required points. Themes are often employed, with 2011 being about visiting U.S. states and their capitals; 2009 were crime scenes; 2007 was about gateway and arches (i.e. Perce Rock on the Atlantic, St. Louis Arch, and Golden Gate Bridge on the Pacific); and 2005 was about lighthouses. First-time finishers are assigned a 3-digit number membership to replace their previously assigned number...that often are five digits in length and over 1,000. As of 2019, slightly more than 600 people have officially finished the Iron Butt Rally. = Books = Many books have either focused on or featured the Iron Butt Rally, some of the most notable of which are listed here. In 1997, Ron Ayres published Against the Wind: A Rider's Account of the Incredible Iron Butt Rally, chronicling his experience in the 1995 rally. Joel Rappoport published Hopeless Class in 2012 about his Iron Butt Rally experience in 2009. Finally, Melissa Holbrook Pierson's The Man Who Would Stop at Nothing: Long Distance Motorcycling's Endless Road features the IBA in a broader discussion of the long-distance riding subculture. =Documentaries= In 2007, a feature-length documentary, Hard Miles, was produced about that year's Iron Butt rally. The DVD chronicled the riders, organizers, routes, strategy, controversy and myriad other details. The high-definition video was received as a welcome update to the small list of professional media on the subject. Bonus material included rider interviews and a 40-minute interview with Mike Kneebone on the 25-year history of the IBR and is considered mandatory viewing by most potential IBR competitors. The 2009 rally was also filmed for a documentary DVD called Hard Miles 2 and included additional material and interviews away from checkpoints. No documentary was made for 2011. =Common Rides (SS1000, BB1500, BBG1500)= The Saddlesore and Bun-Burner were both started in California by the California Motorcycle Touring Association (CMTA). Both the original Saddlesore and Bun-Burners were a fixed-course, group ride. Pressure soon came from many riders who could not make the annual trek to California, so Les Martin, the driving force behind the CMTA, offered a ride that could be completed anywhere. In 1993 Les retired and donated the Saddlesore 1000 and Bun-Burner events to the Iron Butt Association. Prior to 1993, the IBA did not administer a 1000-in-24 ride. However, when the CMTA stopped holding and certifying 1000-in-24 and 1500-in-36 rides, the IBA agreed to sponsor its own version of the Saddlesore 1000 (1,000 miles in 24 hours) and the Bun-Burner (1,500 miles in 36 hours), and added the more extreme Bun-Burner Gold (1,500 miles in 24 hours). =50 cc Quest= Conceived by rider Dave McQueeney, the 50 cc Quest has a straightforward goal to ride across the United States from coast to coast in less than 50 hours. In the first ten years after the ride was first recognized, only ten riders were able to complete it. Although the ride was initially designed for the New York to San Francisco () crowd, the most popular route is the ride from Jacksonville, Florida to San Diego, California. =100CCC= Two 50cc Quests done back to back (coast to coast to coast) in 100 hours or less. This is considered an Extreme Ride. =National Parks Tour Master Traveler= The object of the IBA's National Parks Tour is to take some time to visit the hundreds of National Parks, National Historic Sites, National Recreation Areas, and National Monuments located in the United States and Canada. The riders must purchase a Passport to Your National Parks book, then proceed to visit at least 50 of these sites or parks listed in the Passport book in at least 25 states and provinces within the period of one year. Start and finish times are up to the rider, as long as the time frame does not exceed the one year allotment. =10/10ths Challenge= in 10 days. =The 100K Club= The Iron Butt Association's 100K Club consists of riders who have ridden more than in one year. = RBLR 1000 = The Iron Butt Association in the United Kingdom and The Royal British Legion Riders Branch (RBLR) jointly organize the annual RBLR 1000 event. The RBLR is a motorcyclist's branch of The Royal British Legion, a veterans' organization. In 2018 the RBLR 1000 raised over UK¬£33,000 for the Poppy Appeal. 2019 it will be around the same. 2019 was the tenth running of the event Notes References  Iron Butt Association Forum https://forum.ironbutt.org/index.php External links * Category:Motorcyclists organizations Category:Long-distance motorcycle riding ","title":"Iron Butt Association"},{"id":"859232","text":"WUNC may refer to: * WUNC (FM), a radio station (91.5 FM) licensed to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States * WUNC-TV, a television station (channel 4 analog/25 digital) licensed to Chapel Hill, North Carolina ","title":"WUNC"},{"id":"859234","text":"An example of a mechanical system: A satellite is orbiting the Earth influenced only by the conservative gravitational force; its mechanical energy is therefore conserved. The satellite's acceleration is represented by the green vector and its velocity is represented by the red vector. If the satellite's orbit is an ellipse the potential energy of the satellite, and its kinetic energy, both vary with time but their sum remains constant. In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. It is the macroscopic energy associated with a system. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. If an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase; and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes. In all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, such as frictional forces, will be present, but if they are of negligible magnitude, the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation. In elastic collisions, the kinetic energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy may be converted into thermal energy. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy (dissipation) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule. Many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy, e.g. an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical energy. General Energy is a scalar quantity and the mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the potential energy (which is measured by the position of the parts of the system) and the kinetic energy (which is also called the energy of motion): :E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical}=U+K\\\\, The potential energy, U, depends on the position of an object subjected to a conservative force. It is defined as the object's ability to do work and is increased as the object is moved in the opposite direction of the direction of the force. If F represents the conservative force and x the position, the potential energy of the force between the two positions x1 and x2 is defined as the negative integral of F from x1 to x2: ::U = - \\\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\\\vec{F}\\\\cdot d\\\\vec{x} The kinetic energy, K, depends on the speed of an object and is the ability of a moving object to do work on other objects when it collides with them. It is defined as one half the product of the object's mass with the square of its speed, and the total kinetic energy of a system of objects is the sum of the kinetic energies of the respective objects: ::K={1 \\\\over 2}mv^2 The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if a body or system is subjected only to conservative forces, the mechanical energy of that body or system remains constant. The difference between a conservative and a non-conservative force is that when a conservative force moves an object from one point to another, the work done by the conservative force is independent of the path. On the contrary, when a non-conservative force acts upon an object, the work done by the non-conservative force is dependent of the path.Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), Physics, Section 8-3 (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527 Conservation of mechanical energy MIT professor Walter Lewin demonstrating conservation of mechanical energy According to the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, the mechanical energy of an isolated system remains constant in time, as long as the system is free of friction and other non-conservative forces. In any real situation, frictional forces and other non-conservative forces are present, but in many cases their effects on the system are so small that the principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be used as a fair approximation. Though energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system, it can be converted to another form of energy. =Swinging pendulum= A swinging pendulum with the velocity vector (green) and acceleration vector (blue). The magnitude of the velocity vector, the speed, of the pendulum is greatest in the vertical position and the pendulum is farthest from Earth in its extreme positions. In a mechanical system like a swinging pendulum subjected to the conservative gravitational force where frictional forces like air drag and friction at the pivot are negligible, energy passes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy but never leaves the system. The pendulum reaches greatest kinetic energy and least potential energy when in the vertical position, because it will have the greatest speed and be nearest the Earth at this point. On the other hand, it will have its least kinetic energy and greatest potential energy at the extreme positions of its swing, because it has zero speed and is farthest from Earth at these points. However, when taking the frictional forces into account, the system loses mechanical energy with each swing because of the negative work done on the pendulum by these non-conservative forces. =Irreversibilities= That the loss of mechanical energy in a system always resulted in an increase of the system's temperature has been known for a long time, but it was the amateur physicist James Prescott Joule who first experimentally demonstrated how a certain amount of work done against friction resulted in a definite quantity of heat which should be conceived as the random motions of the particles that comprise matter. as cited on This equivalence between mechanical energy and heat is especially important when considering colliding objects. In an elastic collision, mechanical energy is conserved ‚Äì the sum of the mechanical energies of the colliding objects is the same before and after the collision. After an inelastic collision, however, the mechanical energy of the system will have changed. Usually, the mechanical energy before the collision is greater than the mechanical energy after the collision. In inelastic collisions, some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects is transformed into kinetic energy of the constituent particles. This increase in kinetic energy of the constituent particles is perceived as an increase in temperature. The collision can be described by saying some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects has been converted into an equal amount of heat. Thus, the total energy of the system remains unchanged though the mechanical energy of the system has reduced. =Satellite= plot of kinetic energy K, gravitational potential energy, U and mechanical energy E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical}versus distance away from centre of earth, r at R= Re, R= 2*Re, R=3*Re and lastly R = geostationary radius A satellite of mass m at a distance r from the centre of Earth possesses both kinetic energy, K, (by virtue of its motion) and gravitational potential energy, U, (by virtue of its position within the Earth's gravitational field; Earth's mass is M). Hence, mechanical energy E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical} of the satellite-Earth system is given by :E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical} = U + K :E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical} = - G \\\\frac{M m}{r}\\\\ + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ m v^2 If the satellite is in circular orbit, the energy conservation equation can be further simplified into :E_\\\\mathrm{mechanical} = - G \\\\frac{M m}{2r}\\\\ since in circular motion, Newton's 2nd Law of motion can be taken to be :G \\\\frac{M m}{r^2}\\\\ = \\\\frac{m v^2}{r}\\\\ Conversion Today, many technological devices convert mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa.

The screenplay was written by Fran√ßoise Sagan. The film stars Charles Denner, Mich√®le Morgan, Danielle Darrieux and Hildegard Knef. It was based on the story of French serial killer Henri D√©sir√© Landru, who murdered and dismembered more than 10 women during World War I. Plot During World War I, a seemingly respectable middle-aged man Henri Landru has devised an ingenious means of obtaining money to supplement his dwindling income. Adopting various assumed names, he lures middle-class women to his villa at Gambais just outside Paris, where he kills them and burns their bodies. He then helps himself to his victims‚Äô bank accounts so that he can keep his wife, his mistress and his four children in the manner to which they have grown accustomed. Having murdered ten women and one boy, Landru is finally captured and placed before a court of law. Eloquent in his protestations of innocence, he is confident that no jury will condemn a man of such intellect and breeding.

Oscar Shumsky married Louise Sophia Carboni on October 4, 1939. Together they had two sons; Noel (a business executive & teacher) and Eric (a violist & teacher). A great deal has been written about Shumsky‚Äôs musical artistry however little is known about his ‚Äúother interests‚Äù. Since his childhood in Philadelphia Shumsky was fascinated with photography. He was an avid amateur photographer who could often be found with a camera. His photographic skills and knowledge were recognized by the great American photographer- Ansel Adams. The two men became friends drawn together by their mutual interests and respect; Shumsky a professional musician and amateur photographer and Adams a professional photographer and amateur musician (pianist). Shumsky had a curiosity with the world around him. He was drawn to biology and microbiology which led him to the field of photo microscopy. He would often find himself in a situation where he needed a special mounting to marry one optical device to another. He taught himself how to use a metal lathe and other machining tools to build whatever was needed to accomplish the task. Shumsky had a huge intellect and was capable of learning how to do anything he put his mind to. He was a visionary who often saw things with a uniqueness that surprised others who held more conventional views. He was usually the most profound thinker in the room but he never demeaned others. He had a wonderful sense of humor and loved a good meal and a good laugh. He was a devoted husband and a loving father. He was most happy when he was with his wife Louise. Biography Oscar Shumsky started learning the violin at the age of three, and made his concert debut at the age of seven with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who declared him to be \\"the most astounding genius I have ever heard\\". Fritz Kreisler took a special interest in him, and he played Kreisler's own cadenzas to the Beethoven violin concerto to him after learning them by ear. He was a pupil of Leopold Auer from 1925 and studied at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1928 to 1936, continuing his studies with Efrem Zimbalist after Auer's death in 1930. His New York debut was in 1934 and his Vienna debut was in 1936. He played first violin in the Primrose Quartet from 1939, and the same year joined the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini. During the Second World War, he served in the U.S. Navy. His violin was a Stradivari of 1715 known as 'Ex-Pierre Rode' or the 'Duke of Cambridge' (previously owned by Pierre Rode). It was used by Shumsky to record the complete 24 Caprices by Rode. He tells how he came to acquire the instrument: He taught at the Curtis Institute, Philadelphia, Peabody Conservatory, Baltimore, Yale University, and, from 1953, the Juilliard School in New York. From 1959 to 1967, he co-directed the Stratford Festival (in Ontario) with Glenn Gould, with whom he played regularly at the festival and made some recordings for T.V. broadcast. Around this time, he appeared regularly as a soloist with American orchestras. His conducting debut was in 1959 with the Canadian National Festival Orchestra; he later conducted the Orchestral Workshop of Westchester, the Westchester Symphony Orchestra, and the Empire Sinfonietta in New York, and the New Jersey Colonial Symphony Orchestra. He joined the Bach Aria Group in the early 1960s. He was granted a Ford Foundation Award in 1965. He returned to concerts and recordings in 1981, performing in the USA and in Britain for the first time in 30 years; a programme he gave for solo violin led to great acclaim: He recorded Ysa√øe's solo violin sonatas op.27 and Bach's sonatas and partitas for solo violin, the Beethoven violin concerto, Bach's single and double violin concertos, Mozart's 4th and 5th violin concertos, and other works, including the two Brahms Viola Sonatas on the viola.New York Viola Society list of recordings Many of these recordings have not been released on CD. Many fellow violinists consider him to be one of the great violinists of the century; David Oistrakh called him \\"one of the world's greatest violinists\\" and the New Grove dictionary says of him: 'He was a player of virtuoso technique, pure style and refined taste; yet never sought recognition as a soloist, preferring to concentrate on teaching, chamber music playing and conducting.'

Etymology The expression originally referred to a method of treatment of a rabid dog bite by placing hair from the dog in the bite wound. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer writes in the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1898): \\"In Scotland it is a popular belief that a few hairs of the dog that bit you applied to the wound will prevent evil consequences. Applied to drinks, it means, if overnight you have indulged too freely, take a glass of the same wine within 24 hours to soothe the nerves. 'If this dog do you bite, soon as out of your bed, take a hair of the tail the next day.'\\" He also cites two apocryphal poems containing the phrase, one of which is attributed to Aristophanes. It is possible that the phrase was used to justify an existing practice, as the idea of \\"like cures like\\" () dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates. It exists today as the basic postulate of classical homeopathy. In the 1930s cocktails known as Corpse Revivers were served in hotels. The earliest known reference to the phrase \\"hair of the dog\\" in connection with drunkenness is found in a text from ancient Ugarit dating from the mid to late second millennium BC, in which the god  æIlu becomes hungover after a drinking binge. The text includes a recipe for a salve to be applied to the god's forehead, which consists of \\"hairs of a dog\\" and parts of an unknown plant mixed with olive oil. An early example of modern usage (poil de ce chien) can be found in Rabelais' 16th century pentology Gargantua and Pantagruel, literally translated by Motteux in the late 17th century. In other languages The phrase also exists in Hungarian, where the literal translation to English is \\"(You may cure) the dog's bite with its fur\\", but has evolved into a short phrase (\\"kutyaharap√°st sz≈ër√©vel\\") that is used frequently in other contexts when one is trying to express that the solution to a problem is more of the problem. Among the Irish and Mexicans, the phrase 'The Cure' (\\"curarse la cruda\\", in Spanish) is often used instead of 'hair of the dog'. It is used, often sarcastically, in the question \\"Going for a Cure?\\" In Costa Rica (Central America), the same expression is used but it refers to a pig as in: hair of the same pig (\\"pelos de la misma chancha\\" in Central America) referring to the same method to cure the hangover. In some Slavic languages (Polish, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian and Russian), hair of the dog is called \\"a wedge\\" (klin), mirroring the concept of dislodging a stuck wedge with another one; hence the popular Polish phrase \\"[to dislodge] a wedge [with] a wedge\\" - [wybijaƒá] klin klinem - which is used figuratively both with regard to alcohol and in other contexts. In Bulgarian, the phrase is \\"–ö–ª–∏–Ω –∫–ª–∏–Ω –∏–∑–±–∏–≤–∞\\". The proper Russian term is –æ–ø–æ—Ö–º–µ–ª–∫–∞ (opohmelka, \\"after being drunk\\"), which indicates a process of drinking to decrease effects of drinking the day before. In German, drinking alcohol the next morning to relieve the symptoms is sometimes described as \\"having a counter-beer\\" (ein Konterbier trinken), whereas in Austria people talk about having a repair-beer (Reparatur-Seidl). In Portuguese, people speak of \\"a hit\\" (uma rebatida), meaning to strike away (the hangover with more alcohol). A similar usage is encountered in Romanian, in the phrase \\"Cui pe cui se scoate\\" (A nail (fastener) pulls out a nail); in Italian, in the phrase \\"Chiodo scaccia chiodo\\"; in Spanish, in the phrase \\"Un clavo saca otro clavo\\" (A nail pulls out another nail); and in Turkish, in the phrase \\"√áivi √ßiviyi s√∂ker\\". In all five cases, the English translation is \\"a nail dislodges a nail\\", though these phrases are not exclusively used to refer to the hangover cure. In Swedish, drinking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called having an \\"√•terst√§llare\\", which translates roughly to \\"restorer\\". In Norwegian, it is usually called \\"repareringspils\\", meaning a \\"beer to repair\\". In Finnish, it is called \\"tasoittava\\" (smoothening) or \\"korjaussarja\\" (repair kit) and in Czech \\"vypro≈°≈•ov√°k\\" (extricator). In Tanzania, the equivalent Swahili phrase used is \\"kuzimua\\" which means 'assist to wake up after a coma'. In Danish, a beer the day after drinking, is called a \\"reparationsbajer\\", which translates to \\"repair beer\\". There is also a saying: \\"One must rise at the tree where one fell\\". In Estonia it's called \\"peaparandus\\", which literally translated is \\"head-repair\\". In Korea, alcohol (typically soju) drunk in the morning to relieve hangovers is called \\"haejangsul\\", which literally translates as \\"a drink of wine (on) the morning after.\\" In China, alcohol drunk to relieve hangover is called \\"ÂõûÈ≠ÇÈÖí\\", literally translates to \\"the drink that brings back your soul\\". The phrase also exists in (Sheng) Swahili Slang: In Kenya taking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called \\" Kutoa Lock\\" Translated into \\"removing the Lock\\" In Japan, drinking alcohol in the morning after drinking too much is called Ëøé„ÅàÈÖí (mukae-zake), which roughly translates as \\"counter drinking\\". In Puerto Rico, drinking alcohol as a remedy for a hangover is called \\"matar al rat√≥n\\", or \\"to kill the mouse\\" Scientific background There are at least two hypotheses as to how \\"hair of the dog\\" works. In the first, hangovers are described as the first stage of alcohol withdrawal, which is then alleviated by further alcohol intake. Although \\"...Low [ethanol] doses may effectively prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome in surgical patients\\", this idea is questionable as the signs and symptoms of hangover and alcohol withdrawal are very different. In the second, hangovers are partly attributed to methanol metabolism. Levels of methanol, present as a congener in alcohol, have been correlated with severity of hangover and methanol metabolism to the highly toxic formate via formaldehyde coincides with the rate of appearance of hangover symptoms.Ylikahri RH, Huttunen M, Eriksson CJ, Nikkila EA. Metabolic studies on the pathogenesis of hangover. Eur J Clin Invest 1974;4:93‚Äì100 As both ethanol and methanol are metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase ‚Äì and ethanol is a much better substrate for this enzyme ‚Äì drinking more of the former then effectively prevents (or delays) the metabolism of the latter. As pure ethanol consumption has also been found to increase endogenous levels of methanol, presumably for this reason, this suggests that if \\"hair of the dog\\" works in this way it effects a temporary hiatus rather than a cure. In popular culture In the videogame The Curse of Monkey Island, the main character Guybrush Threepwood needs to make a hangover remedy, which literally includes \\"the hair of the dog that bit you\\" as an ingredient. In the Stanley Kubrick film The Shining, Jack Nicholson's character uses the phrase in reference to the consumption of bourbon on consecutive nights.

The type species is Thymallus thymallus, the grayling. The species in the genus are generically called graylings, but without qualification this also refers specifically to T. thymallus. Distribution The fishes of this genus are native to the northern parts of the Palearctic and Nearctic realms, ranging from the United Kingdom and northern Europe across Eurasia to Siberia, as well as northern North America. T. thymallus, the grayling, is widespread in Europe, and T. arcticus, the Arctic grayling, is widespread throughout Eurasia east of the Ural Mountains and in the Nearctic. The other species have more localized ranges in northern Asia. Appearance Thymallus species are distinguished from other members of the salmon family by their larger scales, their small mouths with teeth on the maxillary bone, and most striking of all, their showy, sail-like dorsal fins. This fin is longer in males and highly colourful, with spots of red, orange, purple or green. The body is also colourful; the dorsal surface is a dark purplish to bluish black or gray, grading to dark blue or silver gray on the flanks and gray or white on the belly. The body is further decorated with a smattering of small dark spots; these are much more numerous in juveniles. Four Arctic grayling (T. arcticus) from the Colville River of Alaska The longest of the graylings is the Arctic grayling, T. arcticus, at a maximum length of and a maximum weight of . T. thymallus, while somewhat shorter - - may weigh significantly more, . The fishes of this genus may live for 18 years or more. Ecology and reproduction These fishes require cool, well-oxygenated water, preferably with a swift current; they are found in large, sandy- or gravel-bottomed rivers and lakes, but T. thymallus may occasionally be found in brackish conditions. Generally omnivorous, they feed primarily on crustaceans, insects, and zooplankton. The grayling species, typically for salmonids, spawn in rivers and do not guard their brood, although they do conceal their eggs in silt. The spawning behavior of the Arctic grayling may be typical for the genus Thymallus. As they are highly sensitive to changes in water quality, Thymallus fishes may be considered indicator species; T. arcticus has largely disappeared from the Great Lakes Basin. Human use grayling (Thymallus thymallus), Lapland Due to their agreeable taste and attractive form, the grayling species are valued as food and game fishes, and they are occasionally seen in public aquaria. The most economically important of these fishes, for which fisheries and aquaculture operations exist, are the grayling (T. thymallus) and the Arctic grayling (T. arcticus). Name The name of the genus Thymallus first given to grayling (T. thymallus) described in the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus originates from the faint smell of the herb thyme, which emanates from the flesh. Thymallus derives from the Greek Œ∏œçŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøœÇ, \\"thyme smell\\".  Species  According to FishBase, 14 species are placed in this genus.

She was supported early in her career by Herbert von Karajan, and has had several works composed especially for her, by Sebastian Currier, Henri Dutilleux, Sofia Gubaidulina, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Norbert Moret, Krzysztof Penderecki, Andr√© Previn, Wolfgang Rihm,Carnegie Hall Playbill, 11 November 2014, p. 38. John Williams and others.  Early life  Mutter was born in the German town of Rheinfelden, which lies some East of Basel on the northern bank of the High Rhine river, across which lies the Swiss town of the same name. She began playing the piano at the age of five, and shortly afterwards took up the violin. Inspired by a recording of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, she began studying with Erna Honigberger, a pupil of Carl Flesch. After Honigberger's death she continued her studies with Aida Stucki at the Winterthur Conservatory.  Career  Mutter's playing began to receive attention and she stopped attending school to devote herself full-time to music. Conductor Herbert von Karajan arranged for her to play with the Berlin Philharmonic. Only 13 years old at the time, she made her public debut on stage in 1976 at the Lucerne Festival, where she played Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major. In 1977, she performed at the Salzburg Festival and with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim. At 15, Mutter made her first recording of the Mozart Third and Fifth violin concerti with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. In 1980, Mutter made her American debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta. In 1985, at the age of 22, she was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (London) and head of its faculty of international violin studies and in 1986 an honorary member. In 1988, she made a grand tour of Canada and the United States, playing for the first time at Carnegie Hall. In 1998 she played and recorded for CD and DVD the complete set of Beethoven's Violin Sonatas, accompanied by Lambert Orkis; these were broadcast on television in many countries.  Repertoire  Though her repertoire includes many classical works, Mutter is particularly known for her performances of contemporary music. Several pieces have been specially written for or dedicated to her, including Henri Dutilleux's Sur le m√™me accord, Krzysztof Penderecki's Second Violin Concerto, Witold Lutos≈Çawski's Chain 2 and the orchestral version of Partita, and Wolfgang Rihm's Gesungene Zeit (\\"Time Chant\\"), Lichtes Spiel, and Dyade. In August 2007, she premiered Sofia Gubaidulina's Violin Concerto No. 2 \\"In tempus praesens.\\" She has received various prizes, including several Grammys. In October 2006, on French television, Mutter appeared to indicate that she would be retiring when she turned 45, in 2008. However the following month she said that her words were \\"misinterpreted\\" and that she would continue to play as long as she felt she could \\"bring anything new, anything important, anything different to music\\".  Appearance  Mutter is known for appearing on stage wearing elegant strapless gowns. Mutter found that fabric was too slippery to provide the traction that she needed while playing. She also received advice on her appearance from Karajan who insisted she have her hair styled and that she \\"go to Paris and get a decent dress\\". Around 18 years of age she purchased a few dresses (on sale) from Chanel and had them shortened: \\"That‚Äôs when my love for custom-made started\\". She has also worn Givenchy. She used to wear John Galliano of Dior, but severed ties after an \\"anti-Semitic outburst\\". She currently wears dresses by Nicholas Oakwell. Mutter prefers red, orange and green colors because they match her Stradivarius violin.  Instruments  She owns two Stradivarius violins: The Emiliani of 1703, and the Lord Dunn-Raven Stradivarius of 1710. continued on page A5 She also owns a Finnigan-Klaembt dated 1999 and a Regazzi dated 2005. Discussing her Stradivariuses, Mutter has said: > A Stradivari is always special as a piece of sublime craftsmanship, but what > sets these instruments apart is their capacity to carry even the softest of > pianissimos to the very last row of any hall. I particularly love the > unlimited scope of colours my violin is able to show, as well as the tiger- > like roaring G-string ‚Ä¶ It is the best instrument I could have, with its own > personality. But it is sensitive to abrupt temperature changes‚Äîwell, it is > 300 years old.  Personal life  In 1989, Mutter married her first husband, Detlef Wunderlich, with whom she had two children, Arabella and Richard. Wunderlich died of cancer in 1995. She dedicated her 1999 recording, Vivaldi: The Four Seasons, to his memory.Liner Notes, Vivaldi: The Four Seasons (Deutsche Grammophon, 1999): 3.

Founded in 1971 by Belgian entrepreneur Baron Fran√ßois Vaxelaire, Quick is the first hamburger chain founded in Europe with around 400 restaurants. Quick is similar in theme to McDonald's and Burger King. In 2007, it was taken over by the French government's investment holding company, CDC, and was purchased by Burger King in February 2016. In September 2016, QSR Belgium bought back restaurants of Belgium and Luxembourg to Bertrand Group. History The chain was first established in 1971 by retail entrepreneur Baron Vaxelaire (Chairman of the GB/GIB Group) with two restaurants, one in Schoten, just outside Antwerp and another one in Waterloo, south of Brussels. The first Quick in France was opened in Aix-en-Provence on July 19, 1980. By December 31, 2010, it operated over 400 restaurants in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the French overseas departments or territories of R√©union, Central African Republic, New Caledonia, Guadeloupe and Martinique. 72% of these restaurants are operated as franchises. Quick used to have a UK and Dutch presence in the 1980s and 90s, including a branch in London's Leicester Square and in Rotterdam, but these are long since closed. From around 2007-08 Quick also had restaurants in Morocco and Algiers, Algeria, as well as Moscow and Tula in Russia, but these have also closed. Although, as of January 2017 one opened in Marrakech, Morocco, two outlets in Tunis, Tunisia and there are plans to reopen in Russia. In September 2016,QSR Belgium bought back restaurants of Belgium and Luxembourg to Bertrand Group The Giant is one of the hamburgers served by Quick restaurants In February 2010, Quick announced that eight of its French franchises would offer halal menus to cater to the Muslim population, a number that increased to 22 in August 2010, and only halal menus are being served since then.A Report from CBN Channel. The move caused controversy from politicians across various parties, including Roubaix's mayor, Marine Le Pen of the National Front, and the UMP, France's ruling political party. In 2011, Quick unveiled Le Double Mix, a two-in-one sandwich featuring a bread-bun done two different ways on each half, with each side having its own dressings. Available in hamburger or chicken varieties, Le Double Mix was sold as a limited-run sandwich, through April 18, 2011.Zagat Buzz Blog: Buffy Fans Freaking Out About Le Double Mix, March 2, 2011 Death of Benjamin Orset On January 22, 2011, 14-year-old Benjamin Orset died after eating two hamburgers at a Quick restaurant in Avignon, France. An autopsy report concluded that he died from food poisoning. Traces of staphylococci were detected in the boy's body, as well as in five of the eight employees. Quick's managing director, Jacques-Edouard Charret, refused to accept responsibility for the death of the boy. However, the investigation found that the death of Orset was a direct result of the meal he had eaten at Quick the day before. Admitting the possibility of a \\"local failure\\" rather than any problems with the products supplied centrally, Quick took control of the Avignon restaurant back from the franchisee. Quick also promised to \\"strengthen its controls and hygiene measures, which are already stricter than the legal standards\\".

It quantifies both the distance and direction of the net or total motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point trajectory. A displacement may be identified with the translation that maps the initial position to the final position. A displacement may be also described as a relative position (resulting from the motion), that is, as the final position of a point relatively to its initial position . The corresponding displacement vector can be defined as the difference between the final and initial positions: : {s}={x_\\\\textrm{f}-x_\\\\textrm{i}}=\\\\Delta{x} In considering motions of objects over time, the instantaneous velocity of the object is the rate of change of the displacement as a function of time. The instantaneous speed, then, is distinct from velocity, or the time rate of change of the distance traveled along a specific path. The velocity may be equivalently defined as the time rate of change of the position vector. If one considers a moving initial position, or equivalently a moving origin (e.g. an initial position or origin which is fixed to a train wagon, which in turn moves with respect to its rail track), the velocity of P (e.g. a point representing the position of a passenger walking on the train) may be referred to as a relative velocity, as opposed to an absolute velocity, which is computed with respect to a point which is considered to be 'fixed in space' (such as, for instance, a point fixed on the floor of the train station). For motion over a given interval of time, the displacement divided by the length of the time interval defines the average velocity, which is a vector, and differs thus from the average speed, which is a scalar.  Rigid body  In dealing with the motion of a rigid body, the term displacement may also include the rotations of the body. In this case, the displacement of a particle of the body is called linear displacement (displacement along a line), while the rotation of the body is called angular displacement.  Derivatives  For a position vector \\\\mathbf{s} that is a function of time t, the derivatives can be computed with respect to t. The first two derivatives are frequently encountered in physics. Velocity :\\\\textbf{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\textbf{s}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} Acceleration :\\\\textbf{a}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\textbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2} Jerk :\\\\textbf{j}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\textbf{a}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\textbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3\\\\textbf{s}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^3} These common names correspond to terminology used in basic kinematics. By extension, the higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion. Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite series, enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics. The fourth order derivative is called jounce.

Opened in September 1903, it was built by the Midland Railway to serve Manchester Central railway station, its northern terminus for its rail services to London St Pancras. It faces onto St Peter's Square. The hotel was designed by Charles Trubshaw in a highly individualistic Edwardian Baroque style. It is a Grade II* listed building.  History  Side of the Midland Hotel Midland Hotel at Night Built at the junction of Peter Street and Lower Mosley Street opposite Manchester Central railway station, terminus for Midland Railway express trains to London St Pancras, the hotel was designed by Charles Trubshaw and constructed between 1898 and 1903 for the Midland Railway Company at a cost of more than ¬£1 million. In 1908 The Railway News reported that the hotel had over 70,000 guests in its first year and described it as a \\"Twentieth century palace\\". The hotel had a 1,000-seat purpose-built theatre where opera, drama and early Annie Horniman performances were staged, and a roof terrace where a string quartet performed. The Midland Hotel was allegedly coveted by Adolf Hitler, who maintained a keen interest in architecture, as a possible Nazi headquarters in Britain. American intelligence speculated that the area of Manchester around the town hall was spared from bombing so as not to damage or destroy the Midland Hotel. The Midland was where Charles Rolls met Henry Royce leading to the formation of Rolls-Royce Limited in 1904. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother dined in the hotel's Trafford Restaurant in November 1959 after attending a Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. The Beatles were famously refused access to the French Restaurant for being \\"inappropriately dressed\\".http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/32056/united_kingdom/the_midland_hotel_in_manchester.html Architecture The Midland has a steel structure clad in red brick, brown terracotta and several varieties of polished granite and Burmantofts terracotta to withstand the polluted environment of Manchester. This includes some fine modelled panels by the sculptor Edward Caldwell Spruce.Burmantofts Pottery (1983) Bradford Art Galleries & Museums and Leeds City Art Gallery p15 The building shares some similarity with other highly decorative Edwardian Baroque buildings in Manchester such as London Road Fire Station and Lancaster House. The building has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. The building was voted Greater Manchester's second-favourite building by readers of the Manchester Evening News in 2012. Once known as the Crowne Plaza Manchester ‚Äì The Midland it was bought by the Paramount Hotel Group (now Barcelo UK) in 2004. It was upgraded in a ¬£12 million renovation and was transferred QHotels (formerly Quintessential Hotels), Paramount's sister company. The hotel was sold in 2018 to a partnership of the Swedish firm Pandox and the Israeli firm Fattal Hotels, which now operates the Midland under its Leonardo Hotels brand.

Ceuta is an integral part of Spain, and therefore of the European Union; its border and its equivalent in Melilla are the only two land borders between the European Union and an African country. The fence consists of parallel 6 metre (20-foot) high fences topped with barbed wire, with regular watchposts and a road running between them to accommodate police patrols or ambulance service in case of need. Underground cables connect spotlights, noise and movement sensors, and video cameras to a central control booth; dozens of guard ships and patrol boats check the coast, while 621 Guardia Civil officers and 548 police officers control the shore.

It is the idealized version of a solid physical tin can having lids on top and bottom. This traditional view is still used in elementary treatments of geometry, but the advanced mathematical viewpoint has shifted to the infinite curvilinear surface and this is how a cylinder is now defined in various modern branches of geometry and topology. The shift in the basic meaning (solid versus surface) has created some ambiguity with terminology. It is generally hoped that context makes the meaning clear. Both points of view are typically presented and distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces, but in the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the right circular cylinder. Types The definitions and results in this section are taken from the 1913 text, Plane and Solid Geometry by George Wentworth and David Eugene Smith . A ' is a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an element of the cylindrical surface. From a kinematics point of view, given a plane curve, called the directrix, a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line, called the generatrix, not in the plane of the directrix, moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix. Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface. A right and an oblique circular cylinder A solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a (solid) '. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an element of the cylinder. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a ' of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a ', otherwise it is called an '. If the bases are disks (regions whose boundary is a circle) the cylinder is called a '. In some elementary treatments, a cylinder always means a circular cylinder. The ' (or altitude) of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between its bases. The cylinder obtained by rotating a line segment about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a '. A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder. The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment. The line that the segment is revolved about is called the ' of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases. A right circular cylinder with radius and height =Right circular cylinders= The bare term cylinder often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis, that is, a right circular cylinder, as shown in the figure. The cylindrical surface without the ends is called an '. The formulae for the surface area and the volume of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity. A right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides. These cylinders are used in an integration technique (the \\"disk method\\") for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution. Properties =Cylindric sections= Cylindric section A cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder's surface with a plane. They are, in general, curves and are special types of plane sections. The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a parallelogram. Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a rectangle. A cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a '. If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder. In more generality, if a right section of a cylinder is a conic section (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic respectively. Cylindric sections of a right circular cylinder For a right circular cylinder, there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder. First, planes that intersect a base in at most one point. A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element. The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an ellipse. If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section. If such a plane contains two elements, it has a rectangle as a cylindric section, otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse. Finally, if a plane contains more than two points of a base, it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle. In the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse, the eccentricity of the cylindric section and semi-major axis of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder and the angle between the secant plane and cylinder axis, in the following way: :::e=\\\\cos\\\\alpha, :::a=\\\\frac{r}{\\\\sin\\\\alpha}. =Volume= If the base of a circular cylinder has a radius and the cylinder has height , then its volume is given by :. This formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder. This formula may be established by using Cavalieri's principle. A solid elliptic cylinder with the semi-axes and for the base ellipse and height In more generality, by the same principle, the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height. For example, an elliptic cylinder with a base having semi-major axis , semi-minor axis and height has a volume , where is the area of the base ellipse (= ). This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration, where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive -axis and the area of each elliptic cross- section, thus: :V=\\\\int_0^h A(x) dx = \\\\int_0^h \\\\pi ab dx = \\\\pi ab \\\\int_0^h dx = \\\\pi abh. Using cylindrical coordinates, the volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated by integration over :::=\\\\int_{0}^{h} \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{0}^{r} s \\\\,\\\\, ds \\\\, d\\\\phi \\\\, dz :::=\\\\pi\\\\,r^2\\\\,h. =Surface area= Having radius and altitude (height) , the surface area of a right circular cylinder, oriented so that its axis is vertical, consists of three parts: * the area of the top base: * the area of the bottom base: * the area of the side: The area of the top and bottom bases is the same, and is called the base area, . The area of the side is known as the ', . An open cylinder does not include either top or bottom elements, and therefore has surface area (lateral area) :. The surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components: top, bottom and side. Its surface area is therefore, :, where is the diameter of the circular top or bottom. For a given volume, the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has . Equivalently, for a given surface area, the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has , that is, the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle).. The lateral area, , of a circular cylinder, which need not be a right cylinder, is more generally given by: :, where is the length of an element and is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder. This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder. Hollow cylinder = Right circular hollow cylinder (cylindrical shell)= A right circular hollow cylinder (or ') is a three-dimensional region bounded by two right circular cylinders having the same axis and two parallel annular bases perpendicular to the cylinders' common axis, as in the diagram. Let the height be , internal radius , and external radius . The volume is given by : V = \\\\pi ( R ^{2} - r ^{2} ) h = 2\\\\pi \\\\left ( \\\\frac{R + r}{2} \\\\right) h (R - r). . Thus, the volume of a cylindrical shell equals 2(average radius)(altitude)(thickness). The surface area, including the top and bottom, is given by : A = 2 \\\\pi ( R + r ) h + 2 \\\\pi ( R^2 - r^2 ). . Cylindrical shells are used in a common integration technique for finding volumes of solids of revolution. =On the Sphere and Cylinder= A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases In the treatise by this name, written c. 225 BCE, Archimedes obtained the result of which he was most proud, namely obtaining the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere by exploiting the relationship between a sphere and its circumscribed right circular cylinder of the same height and diameter. The sphere has a volume that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface area that of the cylinder (including the bases). Since the values for the cylinder were already known, he obtained, for the first time, the corresponding values for the sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius is . The surface area of this sphere is . A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request. Cylindrical surfaces In some areas of geometry and topology the term cylinder refers to what has been called a cylindrical surface. A cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Such cylinders have, at times, been referred to as '. Through each point of a generalized cylinder there passes a unique line that is contained in the cylinder. Thus, this definition may be rephrased to say that a cylinder is any ruled surface spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines. A cylinder having a right section that is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder and hyperbolic cylinder, respectively. These are degenerate quadric surfaces. Parabolic cylinder When the principal axes of a quadric are aligned with the reference frame (always possible for a quadric), a general equation of the quadric in three dimensions is given by :f(x,y,z)=Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dx + Ey + Gz + H = 0, with the coefficients being real numbers and not all of , and being 0. If at least one variable does not appear in the equation, then the quadric is degenerate. If one variable is missing, we may assume by an appropriate rotation of axes that the variable does not appear and the general equation of this type of degenerate quadric can be written as :A \\\\left ( x + \\\\frac{D}{2A} \\\\right )^2 + B \\\\left(y + \\\\frac{E}{2B} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\rho, where :\\\\rho = -H + \\\\frac{D^2}{4A} + \\\\frac{E^2}{4B}. If this is the equation of an elliptic cylinder. Further simplification can be obtained by translation of axes and scalar multiplication. If \\\\rho has the same sign as the coefficients and , then the equation of an elliptic cylinder may be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)^2+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right)^2 = 1. This equation of an elliptic cylinder is a generalization of the equation of the ordinary, circular cylinder (). Elliptic cylinders are also known as cylindroids, but that name is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the Pl√ºcker conoid. If \\\\rho has a different sign than the coefficients, we obtain the imaginary elliptic cylinders: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right)^2 = -1, which have no real points on them. (\\\\rho = 0 gives a single real point.) If and have different signs and \\\\rho eq 0, we obtain the hyperbolic cylinders, whose equations may be rewritten as: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right)^2 = 1. Finally, if assume, without loss of generality, that and to obtain the parabolic cylinders with equations that can be written as: : {x}^2+2a{y}=0 . In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity, which corresponds visually to a cylinder in perspective appearing to be a cone towards the sky. Projective geometry In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex (vertex) lies on the plane at infinity. If the cone is a quadratic cone, the plane at infinity (which passes through the vertex) can intersect the cone at two real lines, a single real line (actually a coincident pair of lines), or only at the vertex. These cases give rise to the hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic cylinders respectively. This concept is useful when considering degenerate conics, which may include the cylindrical conics. Prisms Tycho Brahe Planetarium building, Copenhagen, is an example of a truncated cylinder A solid circular cylinder can be seen as the limiting case of a -gonal prism where approaches infinity. The connection is very strong and many older texts treat prisms and cylinders simultaneously. Formulas for surface area and volume are derived from the corresponding formulas for prisms by using inscribed and circumscribed prisms and then letting the number of sides of the prism increase without bound. One reason for the early emphasis (and sometimes exclusive treatment) on circular cylinders is that a circular base is the only type of geometric figure for which this technique works with the use of only elementary considerations (no appeal to calculus or more advanced mathematics). Terminology about prisms and cylinders is identical. Thus, for example, since a truncated prism is a prism whose bases do not lie in parallel planes, a solid cylinder whose bases do not lie in parallel planes would be called a truncated cylinder. From a polyhedral viewpoint, a cylinder can also be seen as a dual of a bicone as an infinite-sided bipyramid.

The inner surface of the cylinder is formed from either a thin metallic liner (also called \\"sleeve\\") or a surface coating applied to the engine block. A piston is seated inside each cylinder by several metal piston rings, which also provide seals for compression and the lubricating oil. The piston rings do not actually touch the cylinder walls, instead they ride on a thin layer of lubricating oil.  Steam engines  Cylinder (and piston) in a double-acting steam engine The cylinder in a steam engine is made pressure- tight with end covers and a piston; a valve distributes the steam to the ends of the cylinder. Cylinders were cast in cast iron and later in steel. The cylinder casting can include other features such as valve ports and mounting feet.  Internal combustion engines  Cross-section of a cylinder, along with the valves, spark plug, piston and connecting rod The cylinder is the space through which the piston travels, propelled to the energy generated from the combustion of the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. In an air- cooled engine, the walls of the cylinders are exposed to the airflow, to provide the primary method of cooling to the engine. Most air-cooled engines have cooling fins on the cylinders and each cylinder has a separate case in order to maximise the surface area available for cooling. For motorcycle engines, a \\"reverse cylinder engine\\" is where the intake ports are on the front side of each cylinder, and the exhaust ports are on the rear side of each cylinder. = Cylinder liners/sleeves = Cylinder liners (also known as sleeves) are thin metal cylinder-shaped parts which are inserted into the engine block to form the inner wall of the cylinder. Alternatively, an engine can be 'sleeveless', where the cylinder walls are formed by the engine block with a wear-resistant coating, such as Nikasil or plasma-sprayed bores. During use, the cylinder liner is subject to wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This wear is minimized by the thin oil film which coats the cylinder walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in. On some engines, the cylinder liner is replaceable, in case it becomes worn or damaged. On engines without replaceable sleeves, the cylinder can sometimes be repaired by boring out the existing liner to produce a new smooth and round surface (although the diameter of the cylinder is slightly increased). Another repair technique is 'sleeving' the cylinder‚Äî boring it and then installing a sleeve in the extra space created by the boring. Most engines use 'dry liners', where the liner is surrounded by the engine block and does not make contact with the coolant. However, cylinders with 'wet liners' are used in some water-cooled engines, especially French designs. The wet liners are formed separately from the main casting so that liquid coolant is free to flow around their outsides. The advantage of wet liners is better cooling and a more even temperature distribution, however this design reduces the rigidity of the engine.

The amount by which the liquid rises in the cylinder is equal to the volume of the rock. In fluid mechanics, displacement occurs when an object is largely immersed in a fluid, pushing it out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured, and from this, the volume of the immersed object can be deduced (the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid). An object that sinks displaces an amount of fluid equal to the object's volume. Thus buoyancy is expressed through Archimedes' principle, which states that the weight of the object is reduced by its volume multiplied by the density of the fluid. If the weight of the object is less than this displaced quantity, the object floats; if more, it sinks. The amount of fluid displaced is directly related (via Archimedes' principle) to its volume. In the case of an object that sinks (is totally submerged), the volume of the object is displaced. In the case of an object that floats, the amount of fluid displaced will be equal in weight to the displacing object. Archimedes' principle, a physical law of buoyancy, states that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid (gas or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force the magnitude of which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface of an object partially submerged in a liquid. The weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction; the object neither rises nor sinks. If the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid, the object rises, as in the case of a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a helium-filled balloon that is let loose in the air. An object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces, though it sinks when released, has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In fact, in some accurate weighing, a correction must be made in order to compensate for the buoyancy effect of the surrounding air. The buoyant force, which always opposes gravity, is nevertheless caused by buoyancy. Fluid pressure increases with depth because of the (gravitational) weight of the fluid above. This increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth. The result is buoyancy. Applications of displacement This method can be used to measure the volume of a solid object, even if its form is not regular. Several methods of such measuring exist. In one case the increase of liquid level is registered as the object is immersed in the liquid (usually water). In the second case, the object is immersed into a vessel full of liquid (called an overflow can), causing it to overflow. Then the spilled liquid is collected and its volume measured. In the third case, the object is suspended under the surface of the liquid and the increase of weight of the vessel is measured. The increase in weight is equal to the amount of liquid displaced by the object, which is the same as the volume of the suspended object times the density of the liquid. The concept of Archimedes' principle is that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The weight of the displaced fluid can be found mathematically. The mass of the displaced fluid can be expressed in terms of the density and its volume, . The fluid displaced has a weight , where is acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid can be expressed as . The weight of an object or substance can be measured by floating a sufficiently buoyant receptacle in the cylinder and noting the water level. After placing the object or substance in the receptacle, the difference in weight of the water level volumes will equal the weight of the object.

The psychoanalytic mainstream Among Freud's mainstream followers, Otto Fenichel highlighted the displacement of affect, either through postponement or by redirection, or both.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 163 More broadly, he considered that \\"in part the paths of displacement depend on the nature of the drives that are warded off\\".Fenichel, p. 199 Eric Berne in his first, psychoanalytic work, maintained that \\"some of the most interesting and socially useful displacements of libido occur when both the aim and the object are partial substitutions for the biological aim and object...sublimation\\".Berne, A Layman's Guide p. 78 Lacan In 1957, Jacques Lacan, inspired by an article by linguist Roman Jakobson on metaphor and metonymy, argued that the unconscious has the structure of a language, linking displacement to the poetic function of metonymy,David Macey, Introduction, Jacques Lacan, The Four Funadamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (1994) p. xxviii and condensation to that of metaphor. As he himself put it, \\"in the case of Verschiebung, 'displacement', the German term is closer to the idea of that veering off of signification that we see in metonymy, and which from its first appearance in Freud is represented as the most appropriate means used by the unconscious to foil censorship\\".Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 160 Aggression The aggressive drive ‚Äì known as mortido ‚Äì may be displaced quite as much as the libidinal - the sex drive. Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, offer plentiful opportunities for the expression of displaced mortido.Berne, p. 80 In such scapegoating behavior, aggression may be displaced onto people with little or no connection with what is causing anger or frustration. Some people punch cushions when they are angry at friends; a college student may snap at his or her roommate when upset about an exam grade. Displacement can also act in what looks like a 'chain-reaction,' with people unwittingly becoming both victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a man is angry with his boss, but he cannot express this properly, so he hits his wife. The wife, in turn, hits one of the children, possibly disguising this as a \\"punishment.\\" (rationalization) Ego psychology sought to use displacement in child rearing, a dummy being used as a displaced target for toddler sibling rivalry.Selma H.

It is the only species of the genus Thymallus (the graylings) native to Europe, where it is widespread from the United Kingdom and France to the Ural Mountains in Russia, but does not occur in the southern parts of the continent. It was introduced to Morocco in 1948, but it does not appear to have become established there.  Attributes  The grayling grows to a maximum recorded length of and a maximum recorded weight of . Of typical Thymallus appearance, the grayling proper is distinguished from the similar Arctic grayling (T. arcticus arcticus) by the presence of 5‚Äì8 dorsal and 3‚Äì4 anal spines, which are absent in the other species; T. thymallus also has a smaller number of soft rays in these fins. Individuals of the species have been recorded as reaching an age of 14 years. The grayling prefers cold, clean, running riverine waters, but also occurs in lakes and, exceptionally, in brackish waters around the Baltic Sea. Omnivorous, the fish feeds on vegetable matter, as well as crustaceans, insects and spiders, mollusks, zooplankton, and smaller fishes, such as Eurasian minnows. Grayling are also prey for larger fish, including the huchen (Hucho hucho). With the Arctic grayling, T. thymallus is one of the economically important Thymallus species, being raised commercially and fished for sport. The grayling is a protected species listed in Appendix III of the Bern Convention. It has become critically endangered in the Baltic Sea. Adult grayling The term \\"grayling\\" is often used to refer generically to the Thymallus species, and T. thymallus is sometimes called the European grayling for clarity. There are many obsolete synonyms for the species. The generic name Thymallus derives from the Greek Œ∏œçŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøœÇ, \\"thyme smell\\", a name derived from the fragrance of wild thyme that freshly caught graylings are believed to smell similar to. Thymallus thymallus is the type species of its genus.  Angling  The grayling is known as the 'lady of the stream'. In Europe, they used to be persecuted by anglers for the false perception that they stopped trout colonizing stretches of rivers and streams. However, research has shown that grayling and trout feed on different prey items and generally prefer different microhabitats within rivers and streams but do occupy similar niches to smaller, less-predatory trout. In England and Wales, they can be fished for throughout the coarse fishing season (16 June to 14 March), providing thrilling sport on the fly when the trout season is closed. There is no closed season for grayling in Scotland; where they have been introduced. There are no grayling in Ireland. Well-known grayling flies include the grayling witch, klinkhamers, various nymphs and 'red tags', along with other trout patterns. Flies tied to resemble small pink shrimps have also been found to be useful. A method known as 'Czech-nymphing' has been known to be helpful to anglers where grayling shoal up in colder periods. The method involves moving a series of Czech nymphs under the tip of the fly rod with the flow of the river and the nymphs should entice the grayling to take one. Fly-anglers may wade in the river to perform this method where they can access deeper water. Wading does not necessarily spook the grayling as they are generally less cautious than trout and are not as easily put off by human presence. In France, too, the season is limited depending upon several factors. The Allier River is one of the rare places in Southern Europe where the common grayling occurs in a natural habitat.

Miller was laid down 18 August 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Francisco, California; launched 15 February 1943; sponsored by Mr. William P. Upshur; and commissioned 31 August 1943, Commander T. H. Kolberg in command.  1944  Miller, assigned to the Pacific in Destroyer Squadron 52 (DesRon 52) throughout her World War II service, departed 20 November 1943, for Pearl Harbor. There she conducted exercises until 22 January 1944, interrupted by an escort mission to Makin. On the 23rd she got underway and sailed west with Task Force 51 (TF 51). For the next month she provided screening and gunfire support services as that force assaulted and occupied Kwajalein and Eniwetok. She departed the latter 24 February for Majuro where she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force (then 5th Fleet's TF 58, later 3rd Fleet's TF 38), with which she operated for the remainder of the war. On 22 March the aircraft carriers, supported by battleships and cruisers, and screened by a ring of destroyers, departed Majuro with Miller in the outer ring of steel. Completing strikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai (29 March-1 April) they returned briefly to Majuro and then headed for New Guinea where they supported Army assault forces with raids on Hollandia, Wakde, Sewar, and Sarmi (21 April-22 April) and then raided Truk, Satawan, and Ponape (29 April-1 May). Next the force hit Marcus and Wake Islands (19 May-23 May) and then prepared for the Marianas campaign. On 6 June the carrier force sortied from Majuro again. From the 11th through the 17th its planes and ships ranged from the Volcano and Bonin Islands to the southernmost Marianas, supporting the assault on Saipan and preventing Japanese reinforcements from reaching that beleaguered island and the next target, Guam. On the 17th, after screening the carriers during flight operations for strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam, Miller received word of a Japanese Fleet approaching from the Philippines. On the 18th she continued to cover the assault forces on Saipan while waiting for the expected engagement. On the 19th she was on the starboard quarter of as enemy dive bombers opened the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Throughout the 2-day battle, which tore the muscle from the Japanese naval air arm, she remained in that carrier's screen, splashing one enemy plane and damaging another. After brief upkeep at Eniwetok, Miller got underway to rendezvous with the remainder of the task force for further strikes on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima (3-4 July) and Palau, Ulithi, and Yap (23-27 July). On 30 August the force sailed to support the landings in the Palaus by conducting raids against Palau, Mindanao, Leyte, Luzon, and Samar (7-24 September). In October, operating from Ulithi, the task force prepared for the return to the Philippines with strikes on enemy installations in shipping in the Ry≈´ky≈´s, on Taiwan, and in the South China Sea. On the 20th, it commenced support of amphibious operations on Leyte and Samar. Five days later Miller joined the screen of Task Group 34.5 (TG 34.5), then operating with TG 38.2. The two groups then sailed to assist TF 77 which had engaged an enemy force in Surigao Strait in an opening phase of the epic Battle of Leyte Gulf. Shortly after midnight, while patrolling the waters at the eastern end of San Bernardino Strait, TG 34.5 sighted an enemy destroyer. After several exchanges of gunfire, Miller and closed in to finish off the target, accomplishing their missions in under 20 minutes. Miller then rejoined TF 38 which had resumed air operations against the Philippines. The force raided air installations on Luzon, Leyte, and Samar into November, receiving, on the 19th, its first taste of a new Japanese tactic, the kamikaze. Six days later several of the suicide planes broke through the screen of planes and destroyers to score hits on the carriers , , and . With slight damage, except to Intrepid, the force retired to Ulithi. Thence the force sortied, 11 December, to support amphibious operations on Mindoro, and keep Japanese air forces pinned to the ground. Next came strikes on Taiwan, followed by another return to the Philippines to support amphibious operations, this time in Lingayen Gulf.  1945  After the Luzon landings, the force stepped up its sorties into the South and East China Seas. It struck repeatedly at enemy installations from Saigon to the Ryukyus and frequently sailed northeast to raid the industrial heart of the Japanese Islands. On 19-21 February 1945 they supported the invasion of Iwo Jima and then steamed west again towards Tokyo. By 1 March they had begun an intensified raiding campaign against the Ryukyus and Japan, again preparing the way for an invasion force. Miller, participating in these raids on Okinawa, Ky≈´sh≈´, and Honsh≈´, was near when an enemy dive bomber penetrated the screen to drop several 500-pound bombs on the carrier, 19 March. The destroyer went alongside to aid in the rescue and firefighting operations and then covered the carrier's withdrawal, for which actions she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. Miller rejoined the fast carriers 8 April as they provided air cover for ground forces embattled on Okinawa. Into June she screened the carriers and rescued downed pilots as the force struck at military and industrial concentrations from the southern Ryukus to Ky≈´sh≈´. On the 20th, she was detached from TF 38 and ordered back to the United States for navy yard availability. She arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 9 July, and was still moored there when the war ended.  1945‚Äì1964  On 19 December 1945 Miller decommissioned and joined the Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She remained there until 19 May 1951, when she recommissioned and joined the Atlantic Fleet with Newport, Rhode Island as her homeport. On 6 September 1952 the destroyer departed the East Coast for Korea and a round-the-world cruise. Arriving at Sasebo, Japan, 11 October, she got underway for gunfire support and interdiction fire duty with TF 95 off the Korean coast. Remaining on station in the combat area almost continuously until February 1953, Miller also served with TF 77 screening carriers as they conducted air operations against North Korean ground forces. On 11 February she departed for home, via the Mediterranean. After her return to Newport she resumed operations along the East Coast with periodic deployment in the Mediterranean. In 1958, while serving with the 6th Fleet. she participated in that fleet's swift response to the request of President Camille Chamoun of Lebanon for tangible aid to prevent a threatened coup d‚Äôetat. In 1959 Miller was detached from service with the active fleet and reported for Naval Reserve training duty at Boston 9 March. Whilst in Boston, a cadet from the training ship MV Rakaia swam across the harbour at night and raised the Soviet flag on her flag mast as a joke. As a training ship, USS Miller conducted cruises for more than 11,000 reservists. October 1961 President John F. Kennedy activated her reserve crew during the Berlin Wall Crisis. On 30 March 1964 she sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. There, on 30 June, she was decommissioned and reentered the Reserve Fleet. Miller was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1974. She was sold 31 July 1975 and broken up for scrap.

During the late 1700s, French fur trappers established a camp at the base of Cavanal and named it Poteau, for \\"Post\\". Thomas Nuttall studied plant life here in 1819, and learned about other natural wonders from local French trappers and Indians who were living here. During territorial times Cavanal Hill was along the border of Skullyville County and Sugar Loaf County, two of the constituent counties making up the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. In the late 1800s, Walter Beard established a health resort at the summit of Cavanal Hill. This was a modest wood frame structure that catered to visitors in the area. Besides the view, the major draw was the natural springs that occur throughout the region. Halfway up Cavanal Hill, George Witte established the town of Witteville. This was a coal mining company town. The mines were located three miles east of the town. Witteville is still marked on some maps, and can be found at the \\"Y\\" leading up to the top of Cavanal Hill. Much of the road leading up to the top of the hill was part of the original railroad that led to Witteville. In the 1960s, Senator Robert S. Kerr established a summer residence at the summit of Cavanal Hill. This summer house was located on the same site where Walter Beard first established his health resort. Recreation Cavanal Hill is now the site of mountain bike races and the Cavanal Hill Killer 5-Mile Walk. A blacktopped road leads to the summit where visitors can enjoy picturesque views of the Poteau River Valley. Reportedly, one can see Mount Magazine in Arkansas from here on a clear day.

Early life McCulloch was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee, one of twelve children of Alexander McCulloch and Frances Fisher LeNoir. Henry's father Alexander, a Yale University graduate, was a descendant of Captain Nicolas Martiau, the French Huguenot settler of Jamestown, Virginia and ancestor of President George Washington. Alexander was also an officer on Brig. Gen. John Coffee's staff during the Creek War of 1813 and 1814 in Alabama; his mother was a daughter of a prominent Virginia planter. The family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in North Carolina before the American Revolution, but Alexander McCulloch had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Two of Henry McCulloch's older brothers briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, Sam Houston.) After several moves, the family settled at Dyersburg, where one of their closest neighbors was David Crockett‚Äîa great influence on both McCulloch and his older brother, Ben McCulloch, who also would become a Confederate brigadier general. Texas career Henry McCulloch shared in his brother Ben's economic attempts in the 1830s, including transporting goods by raft on the Mississippi, once all the way to New Orleans. When Davy Crockett went to Texas in 1835, Henry McCulloch and his brother made plans to meet Crockett's Tennessee Boys at Nacogdoches on Christmas Day. However, Ben contracted measles and was bedridden for several weeks and while ill convinced his brother Henry to return to Tennessee in November 1835. Luckily, the illness kept them from arriving with Crockett at the Alamo. In 1838, both Henry and Ben McCulloch were making a living as surveyors. They also made a reputations as Indian fighters. Both took part in the Battle Creek Fight against the Comanche Indians in Navarro County, also known as \\"The Surveyors' Fight\\". In 1839, Henry McCulloch was on the muster roll of Capt. Mathew Caldwell's \\"Gonzales Rangers\\". Also in 1839, Ben was elected to the Republic of Texas House of Representatives after a contentious campaign that included assorted slanders between the candidates. As a result, Ben fought a rifle duel with his opponent, Reuben Ross and received a permanently crippling wound in the arm. The matter was considered closed but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry, who killed Ross with a pistol. On August 20, 1840, McCulloch married Jane Isabella Ashby, daughter of John Miller Ashby and Mary Harris Garnett of Kentucky, who had been early settlers in the DeWitt Colony, which was centered on Gonzales. They had twelve children, most of whom remained in Texas. Later in 1840, McCulloch took part in the Battle of Plum Creek, acting as a scout against the Comanches and being wounded. When a Mexican raiding force under Gen. Adrian Woll invested San Antonio in September 1842, he served as First Lieutenant of a company of volunteers from Seguin. He again operated as a scout, including infiltrating enemy lines, and commanded a spy company at the Battle of Salado Creek. With his brother, Ben, he subsequently took part in the failed Somervell expedition and both men were ordered to leave shortly before most of the Texans were captured at Mier, Mexico in Tamaulipas, December 25, 1842. He was elected sheriff of Gonzales in 1843 and also opened a mercantile business there. The following year, he moved his family permanently to Seguin. There are several letters written in the 1890s (now in the possession of the Texas State Library) in which McCulloch describes his (and his brother's) activities during the Texas Revolution and under the Republic. In December 1847, McCulloch was in command of a Ranger company in Burnet County and established what became Fort Croghan. When the War with Mexico began, he took command of a volunteer company patrolling the same area of the western frontier against Indian raids. He continued this service after the war as captain of a company of Texas Mounted Volunteers out of Fort Murrill, and also operating a Ranger post in Kimble County. He served in both houses of the Texas Legislature from Guadalupe County, being elected to the House of Representatives in 1853 and the Senate in 1855. Among other subjects, he introduced bills to regulate the use by slaveowners of \\"manager slaves\\" and to acquire the Alamo as a state monument. He then received an appointment as U.S. marshal from President Buchanan for the eastern district of Texas, and was a delegate from Guadalupe County to the Texas secession convention in January 1861. {His brother Ben had been 1852 US Marshal for the eastern District of Texas} Civil War A few days after the convention voted for secession from the union on February 1, 1861 (though before the necessary referendum), the Texas Committee of Public Safety established a Provisional Army, in which McCulloch received a commission as colonel. On March 4, he was appointed commander of the 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, also known (especially to its officers) as the 1st Texas Mounted Rifles. The unit was recruited from several counties in central Texas to serve for twelve months and was the first Texas cavalry regiment to enter Confederate service. Its mission was to maintain a line of patrol from the Red River southwest to the junction of the Concho and North Concho Rivers, a point near present-day San Angelo. McCulloch was acknowledged by his superiors and others for his emphasis on precise discipline and gentlemanly conduct in his regiment. His training methods included complex cavalry and infantry maneuvers as well as sabre-fighting and the proper care of horses and equipment. Many Texas units maintained only lax rules of propriety and organization, but the 1st Texas remained a cohesive and loyal unit, disbanding only under the proper orders. After receiving word of the action at Fort Sumter, McCulloch moved five companies to confront any federal troops remaining in Texas who had not yet embarked at the port of Indianola, but en route he received orders from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to intercept a federal force northwest of San Antonio. On May 9, McCulloch's troops, numbering some 1,300, captured the 8th U.S. Infantry near San Lucas Springs. Late in June, McCulloch crossed the Red River with Maj. Edward Burleson to ensure the friendliness (or at least the neutrality) of the Wichita and Caddo Indians, following this with a warning that any raids across the river into Texas would bring retaliation‚Äîand over the following year, there were in fact a number of engagements between elements of the 1st Texas and Indian raiding parties. The success of the Texas troops in suppressing these raids is shown in the fact that the number of raids actually decreased during 1861 and 1862 from the numbers reported in previous years. In September 1861, McCulloch, now a brigadier general, assumed temporary command of the Department of Texas until the arrival of Brig. Gen. Paul O. H√©bert, and in December was named to command the new Western Military District, comprising that part of the state west and south of San Antonio. Early the next year, he was ordered to assume co-command of Texas State Troops being sent to Arkansas. On September 6, 1862, following the death near Little Rock of his co- commander, Allison Nelson of Waco, McCulloch took command of the new Texas Division and organized it into four brigades, ultimately taking command of the Third Brigade himself while the division as a whole was under the command of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker. The division was attached to the District of Arkansas, Trans-Mississippi Department, and by April 1863 it was in Louisiana, where it took part in the Red River Campaign, the Camden Expedition, and the Battle of Milliken's Bend, which was an early phase of the Vicksburg campaign. In July 1863, the division arrived in Alexandria, Louisiana, where McCulloch was replaced by Col. George M. Flournoy. McCulloch was approached as a candidate for governor of Texas late that summer, but declined in order to remain on active service. In 1864 and 1865, McCulloch was again in north Texas and in charge of the Western Sub-District of Texas (the entire District now being under the command of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder), where he was active not only in dealing with Indian raids but in pursuing and arresting Confederate deserters and bushwhackers. At the end of the war, on his return to his home in Seguin, he found it necessary to travel with an armed escort because of threats against his life by deserters. Postbellum career In 1874, he was active early in the administration of Gov. Richard Coke, especially in helping to physically remove Edmund J. Davis from the executive offices. In 1876, as a reward for his services to Texas, he was appointed superintendent of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (later the Texas School for the Deaf) in Austin. Though a respected military commander, he proved an inept civil administrator and a legislative investigation forced him to resign his position in 1879; he was succeeded in that office by Col. John S. \\"Rip\\" Ford, his old commander in the Rangers. The retired general apparently enjoyed his retirement, frequently receiving distinguished visitors in his home, giving interviews and engaging in correspondence with inquiring historical writers, and was in regular demand as a speaker at July Fourth festivities throughout central Texas. He was also a trustee in the local Methodist Church. Henry E. McCulloch died March 12, 1895 at Rockport, Texas and was buried in San Geronimo Cemetery in Seguin. He received a full masonic funeral, having been an active freemason after the War in the Guadalupe County lodge. His widow, Jane Ashby McCulloch died in 1896. Camp Henry McCulloch was located at \\"Nuner's Mott\\", about four miles north of the present city limits of Victoria in Victoria County. It was the training site in the fall of 1861 for several infantry and cavalry companies of the 6th Texas Infantry Regiment, CSA (at the time when McCulloch was interim commander of the Department of Texas). A Texas state historical marker was erected at the site. The Gen. Henry E. McCulloch Camp #843 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division, Central Texas Brigade, is located in Brownwood, Texas. Popular culture His wife, Jane Isabella Ashby McCulloch, was a sister of Sarah Ashby McClure and Euphemia Ashby King, two of the main characters Janice Woods Windle's historical novel True Women, which was made into a TV movie.

Biography Jane was born in Richmond, Surrey, England, but worked most of his life in Portsmouth. His father was a vicar and he attended Exeter School.A wealth of knowledge, The Guardian, 31 October 2001 He first began to sketch warships in his teens, and was notable in the 1890s for illustrating scientific romances by George Griffith and other authors, as well as for his own science fiction novels such as To Venus in Five Seconds (published in 1897) and The Violet Flame (1899). An avid miniatures wargamer, Jane first published All the World's Fighting Ships (known as Jane's Fighting Ships after 1905) in 1898, which catalogued all the warships operated by each country, their armaments, and other details, as a supplement to a wargame he designed. It was a success from the start and has become the standard reference directory on the topic. In 1909, he created All the World's Aircraft. Jane's firm is now Jane's Information Group. Jane was an accomplished maritime and naval artist whose works were widely published in periodicals and his own books, those illustrations are now collectable. He was also involved in politics, standing as an Independent candidate for Portsmouth in the 1906 general election. He was strongly opposed to the Liberal Party (especially its left wing) and when a left-wing Liberal candidate Edward Hemmerde was nominated in 1910, he arranged a stunt to disrupt their election campaign. At another public meeting, Jane arranged for a sailor to ask Hemmerde to insist on the supply of hammock ladders should he be elected: Hemmerde fell for this and gave the pledge.

Suqami had been a law student until he was recruited into al-Qaeda along with Majed Moqed, another hijacker, and traveled to Afghanistan where he would be chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks. He arrived in the United States in April 2001. On September 11, 2001, Suqami boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and participated in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks. Early life A native of the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh, Suqami was a law student at the King Saud University. While there he joined a (possible) former roommate named Majed Moqed in training for al-Qaida at Khalden, a large training facility near Kabul that was run by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. In November 2000, the two flew into Iran from Bahrain together. Career The FBI says Suqami first arrived in the U.S. on April 23, 2001, with a visa that allowed him to remain in the country until May 21. However, at least five residents of the Spanish Trace Apartments claim to recognize the photographs of both Suqami and Salem al- Hazmi as living in the San Antonio complex earlier in 2001. However, these residents and several others who claim to have known the hijackers, claim that the FBI photographs of Suqami and Hazmi are reversed. Other reports conflictingly suggested that Suqami was staying with Waleed al-Shehri in Hollywood, Florida and rented a black Toyota Corolla from Alamo Rent-A-Car agency. On May 19, Suqami and Waleed al-Shehri took a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, Bahamas where they had reservations at the Princess Resort. Lacking proper documentation however, they were stopped upon landing, and returned to Florida the same day and rented a red Kia Rio from Avis Rent- A-Car agency. He was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on July 3 he was issued a Florida State Identification Card. Around this time, he also used his Saudi license to gain a Florida drivers' license bearing the same home address as Wail al- Shehri. (A Homing Inn in Boynton Beach). Despite this, the 9/11 Commission claims that Suqami was the only hijacker to not have any US identification. During the summer, Suqami and both Wail and Waleed al-Shehri purchased one month passes to a Boynton Beach gym owned by Jim Woolard. (Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi also reportedly trained at a gym owned by Woolard, in Delray Beach.) Known as Azmi during the preparations,Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others Suqami was called one of the \\"muscle\\" hijackers, who were not expected to act as pilots. CIA director George Tenet later said that they \\"probably were told little more than that they were headed for a suicide mission inside the United States.\\"  Attacks  Suqami's Visa recovered from crash site On September 10, 2001, Suqami shared a room at the Milner Hotel in Boston with three of the Flight 175 hijackers, Marwan al- Shehhi, Fayez Banihammad, and Mohand al-Shehri. On the day of the attacks, Suqami checked in at the flight desk using his Saudi passport, and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. At Logan International Airport, he was selected by CAPPS, which required his checked bags to undergo extra screening for explosives and involved no extra screening at the passenger security checkpoint. An FAA memo, circulated in February 2002, claimed that Suqami shot passenger Daniel M. Lewin (Seat 9B), co-founder of Akamai Technologies and a former member of the Israeli Sayeret Matkal, for attempting to foil the hijacking.While based on the frantic phonecall received from a stewardess of the flight, the report has been a matter of some controversy, since both the FAA and FBI have strongly denied the presence of firearms or guns smuggled aboard. It is now believed that Suqami stabbed Lewin as he attempted to intervene in the hijacking. = Passport discovery = Suqami's passport was reportedly found by a passerby (identity unknown), reportedly in the vicinity of Vesey Street, before the towers collapsed.9/11 Commission hearings, January 26, 2004, Opening staff statement, Susan Ginsburg (This was mistakenly reported by many news outlets to be Mohamed Atta's passport.) A columnist for the British newspaper The Guardian expressed incredulity about the authenticity of this report, questioning whether a paper passport could survive the inferno unsinged when the plane's black boxes were never found. According to testimony before the 9/11 Commission by lead counsel Susan Ginsburg, his passport had been \\"manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al Qaeda.\\" Passports belonging to Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi were found at the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 as well as an airphone.

He is Tintin's friend, an absent-minded professor and half- deaf physicist, who invents many sophisticated devices used in the series, such as a one-person shark-shaped submarine, the Moon rocket, and an ultrasound weapon. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only a little hard of hearing in one ear. Calculus first appeared in Red Rackham's Treasure (more specifically in the newspaper prepublication of 4-5 March 1943 https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/herge.htm), and was the result of Herg√©'s long quest to find the archetypal mad scientist or absent-minded professor. Although Herg√© had included characters with similar traits in earlier stories, Calculus developed into a much more complex figure as the series progressed. Character history Calculus learned savate at university, but is somewhat out of practice in middle-age Calculus is a genius, who demonstrates himself throughout the series to be an expert in many fields of science, holding three PhDs in nuclear and theoretical physics, and planetary astronomy. He is also an experienced engineer, archaeologist, biologist and chemist. Many of his inventions precede or mirror similar technological developments in the real world (most notably the Moon rocket, but also his failed attempt at creating a colour television set). He seeks to benefit humankind through his inventions, developing a pill that cures alcoholism by making alcohol unpalatable to the patient, and refusing under great duress to yield his talents to producing weapons of mass destruction. Much of Calculus's more dangerous work is criticized by Captain Haddock, although Calculus usually interprets this the other way round: his deafness often leads him to misinterpret Haddock's words, preventing him from hearing his real opinion. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour in his interactions with other people, as he often repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. Additionally, he often diverts the subject of a conversation by responding to a misinterpreted remark. For example, \\"But I never knew you had....\\" leads Calculus to respond, \\"No, young man, I am not mad!\\" In the same book he believes that Tintin and Haddock are talking about his sister, before remembering a few moments later that he does not have a sister. He is not perturbed by his handicap, even if it is a source of deep frustration to his friends. He himself does not admit to being near-deaf and insists that he is \\"only a little hard of hearing in one ear.\\" In the course of the Moon books, however, Calculus leads a team of scientists and engineers working on a major rocket project, motivating him to adopt an ear trumpet, and later a hearing aid, and for the duration of the adventure he has near-perfect hearing. This made him a more serious character, even displaying leadership qualities that had not been shown before or since. However, after completing the journey to the Moon, Calculus discarded his hearing aid, forcing his friends to readjust to his hearing impairment (aside from one panel in The Castafiore Emerald, when Tintin is seen speaking to him through his ear-trumpet); this restored the humour surrounding him, though it could be that he finds his deafness useful since it enables him to focus on his work (something useful for The Calculus Affair, since he was referencing ultrasonic sound). Calculus maintains a laboratory at Marlinspike Hall, in which he conducts various experiments. He is fairly protective of his work, on occasion hiding his scientific endeavours from Tintin and Haddock (which gets him into trouble in The Calculus Affair). His lab is also stripped of all its apparatus in the same book. On an earlier occasion, during his efforts to find an antidote to Formula Fourteen in Land of Black Gold, Calculus almost destroyed half of Marlinspike in an explosion. Although generally a mild-mannered (if somewhat oblivious) figure, Calculus flies into an uncharacteristic rage if he feels insulted or ridiculed. He is especially provoked if he ever hears Haddock (or anyone else) call him a \\"goat\\". On one famous occasion in Destination Moon, he displays uncontrollable ire (\\"Goat, am I?\\") when an irritated Haddock accuses him of \\"acting the goat\\" (\\"acting like a goat\\" in the Golden Press American English translation) by attempting to build a Moon rocket. His subsequent tirade and blatant disregard for security terrifies the usually ebullient Captain; he even lifts the director of security barring his way onto a coat hook. Another occasion is in Flight 714 to Sydney when, due to some misunderstanding, he physically assaults Laszlo Carreidas and has to be held back with great effort by Haddock and Tintin. In the same book, despite his deafness, he hears Captain Haddock tell him that he's \\"acting the goat\\", but Haddock quickly prevents the severe reaction from occurring quickly. Earlier in Red Rackham's Treasure Calculus is shown with a frown for a few moments when he thinks that the Captain lied to him that Tintin had gone for a row, when Tintin actually was diving to search for treasure. Despite his gentle nature, Calculus is rather sensitive about his work and does not appreciate being ridiculed or belittled for his scientific efforts. In spite of all this, his friends stick by him come what may. Haddock invited him to stay at Marlinspike Hall after Calculus discovered it is the captain's ancestral home and bought it in his name thanks to money he had earned through selling the patent for his shark-submarine. He did this because Haddock and Tintin had provided him with the opportunity to test the submersible when they were searching for Red Rackham's Treasure. Tintin and Haddock crossed the world on at least two occasions (Prisoners of the Sun and The Calculus Affair) in order to save him from kidnappers. He occasionally comments that he was a great sportsman in his youth, with a very athletic lifestyle. He is a former practitioner of the French martial art savate, although a demonstration in Flight 714 to Sydney shows him to be a bit rusty. Inspirations Auguste Piccard in 1932 Calculus is partly modeled on inventor Auguste Piccard (1884‚Äì1962), Herg√© stated in an interview with Numa Sadoul: \\"Calculus is a reduced scale Piccard, as the real chap was very tall. He had an interminable neck that sprouted from a collar that was much too large... I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, otherwise I would have had to enlarge the frames of the cartoon strip.\\" Horeau, Yves The Adventures of Tintin at Sea 1999, English translation 2004 for the National Maritime Museum, published by John Maurray, . Chapter on Outside characters drawn into the Adventures. The Swiss physics professor held a teaching appointment in Brussels when Herg√© spotted his unmistakable figure in the street. In The Castafiore Emerald, Bianca Castafiore mentions that Calculus is \\"famous for his balloon ascensions\\", an ironic reference to Piccard. Philippe Goddin has suggested that Calculus' deafness was inspired by Paul Eydt, whom Herg√© had known at Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle where Tintin's adventures had first appeared.A la recherche du tr√©sor de Rackham le Rouge (French for \\"In Search of Red Rackham's Treasure\\") by Herg√©, with comments by Daniel Couvreur and Fr√©d√©ric Soumois, published by Editions Moulinsart in November 2007, Cuthbert Calculus' original French name is \\"Tryphon Tournesol\\" and Tryphon was the name of Herg√©'s plumber. In contrast to his unquestionable scientific merits, Calculus is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Herg√© himself was a believer in the subject: dowser Victor Mertens had used a pendulum to find the lost wedding ring of Herg√©'s wife in October 1939. Calculus and his peers Before Calculus appeared in Red Rackham's Treasure, Herg√© had featured other highly educated but eccentric scholars and scientists, such as the following: *Sophocles Sarcophagus of Cigars of the Pharaoh who showed signs of being clumsy and forgetful before going completely mad. *The absent-minded professor who appeared in The Broken Ear and who forgot his glasses, wore his cleaning-lady's overcoat, held his cane upside-down as if it were an umbrella, mistook a parrot for a man and left his briefcase next to a lamp post. In the original edition published in 1935 his name is given as Professor Euclide, after the Greek mathematician known as the \\"Father of Geometry\\". *Professor Hector Alembick in King Ottokar's Sceptre, who had a bad habit of throwing his cigarettes on the floor. *Two astronomers from The Shooting Star also showed unusual and, in one case, mad behaviour: Professor Philippulus, or \\"Philippulus the prophet\\" represented the dilemmas some face over religious belief and scientific research. In his case the conflict took a toll on his mind when the end-of- the-world appeared to be imminent. He then went around wearing bedsheets and beating a gong to warn of the event and later disrupted the eve of departure of the expedition sent to find a meteorite. *His colleague, Professor Decimus Phostle, though not mad, looked forward to the end of the world whose prediction he thought would make him famous. In contrast, he showed signs of maturity during the expedition when he called off the search for the meteorite in order to help a ship in distress. Calculus's introduction appears to have supplied Herg√© with the bizarre nature he wished to portray in a man of science. Other figures of high education were shown as more stable and level- headed. The members of the archaeological expedition who fall victim to The Seven Crystal Balls show no apparent signs of eccentricity. The most prominent member of this group is Calculus's friend Hercules Tarragon, with whom he attended university. Tarragon is a large, ebullient man, possessing a jovial nature, but not necessarily eccentric. While he sometimes appears aloof when absorbed in his work, Calculus corresponds with other scientists and also collaborates with many of them on his projects. Notably, he works with Mr. Baxter and Frank Wolff on the Moon rocket and corresponds with ultrasonics expert Professor Alfredo Topolino of Nyon in The Calculus Affair. Relationship to women Calculus is the only main character in the Tintin series to display signs of attraction to women. This is notably evident in his interactions with Bianca Castafiore, with whom he is smitten during her long stay at Marlinspike Hall in The Castafiore Emerald. During her stay, his botanic experiments lead him to create a new variety of rose, which he names in her honour. Nonetheless, he happily congratulates Captain Haddock on his \\"engagement\\" to Castafiore (in fact a media hoax which he unwittingly fuelled). Calculus is also distressed by Castafiore's imprisonment in Tintin and the Picaros, and is adamant on going to her defence. In the same book, he is charmed by the unattractive Peggy Alcazar (wife of General Alcazar) and kisses her hand after she bluntly criticizes Tintin and Haddock (a remark that Calculus mistakes for a warm greeting). In other media Nestor the butler Calculus also featured frequently in the 1957-1963 Belvision TV series, as well as in other adaptations of the comics. The Belvision TV series is notable for depicting Calculus with perfect hearing. Calculus' original French name was \\"Tournesol\\" which is the French term for sunflower. In the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a series of cartoon television commercials for Fruit d'or products which included cooking oil and mayonnaise made from sunflower oil. Some of the ads would conclude with him floating up into the air to demonstrate how they kept a good healthy balance. Other characters from the books were also included.\\"Fruit D'or,\\" Daily Motion. A pseudonym variation was used on an album by Stephen Duffy - see Tin Tin and \\"Dr. Calculus\\".

Born in the village of Krivaya Kosa of Taganrog district (now Novoazovskyi Raion, Donetsk Oblast) in a fisherman's family. In 1898, Sedov finished navigation courses in Rostov-on-Don and acquired the rank of long voyage navigator. In 1901, he took an external degree at Naval College, passed all the exams and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In 1902-1903, Sedov participated in a hydrographic expedition in the Arctic Ocean. During the Russo-Japanese War he was in charge of a torpedo boat (1905). In 1909, he led the expedition that would later describe the mouth of the Kolyma river. A year later Sedov explored the Krestovaya Bay on Novaya Zemlya. In 1912, he suggested a sleigh expedition for reaching the North Pole. The Tsarist government refused to finance this project, and the expedition was organized with the help from independent sources. On August 14(27), 1912, Sedov's ship Svyatoy Muchenik Foka (Saint Phocas the Martyr) left Arkhangelsk and had to stay for the winter near Novaya Zemlya because of impassable ice. The expedition reached Franz Josef Land only in August 1913; however, it had to stay for the second winter in the Tikhaya Bay due to lack of coal. On February 2(15), 1914, Sedov (already sick with scurvy) and his accompanying seamen G.Linnik and A.Pustotniy set off for the North Pole with their draft dogs. Before reaching Rudolf Island, Sedov died at sea and was buried at Cape Auk on this island. On the way back, at Franz Josef Land, the Svyatoy Foka rescued two survivors of the Brusilov expedition, including Valerian Albanov. As part of the search for the Sedov expedition Jan Nag√≥rski made the first airplane flights over the Arctic, gaining valuable experience for later aeronautical expeditions to the region. Two gulfs and a peak on Novaya Zemlya, a glacier and a cape on Franz Josef Land, an island in the Barents Sea, and a cape in Antarctica bear Sedov's name. There was also a steam icebreaker Georgy Sedov. Today, the sail training barque STS Sedov bears his name.

It was written by Calvin Clements and Steve Fisher, and directed by Lee Katzin. This series had US Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon aiding President Ulysses S. Grant in the 1870s American West. Together they faced a plethora of Victorian-era criminals.

Gilbert, played by John Pickard *Dr. Meyer, played by Arthur Malet *Maria, played by Sara Taft *Lopez, played by Allen Jaffe *bartender, played by Bruno VeSota As secret agent Jim West entered a sailor's shop on the wharf, he witnessed the death by strangulation of a man named Gilbert at the hands of an assassin named Torres. West tried to stop the murderer but bullets glanced harmlessly off the man, and the agent finally drove him off with a smoke pellet. West learned that Colonel \\"Iron Man\\" Torres (John Dehner), a former Army officer scarred and crippled by an accidental explosion and repaired by surgically implanted steel plates, systematically murdered six officers who he thought were responsible for his accident. He served with seven officers during the Civil War and believed they tricked him into pulling guard duty when his accident occurred. Nina (Sue Ann Langdon), Gilbert's niece, appeared waving a picture of Torres and the other officers, the last one alive being President Ulysses Grant (Roy Engel). Fearing for Grant's life, West and Gordon unsuccessfully tried to divert Grant away from his speech in a nearby town. In order to pursue his vengeance, Torres learned the skills of 'auto-suggestion' instead of anesthetics during surgery, and hypnosis, in the form of a spinning lampshade, which he used to regress the niece of his latest victim, Nina Gilbert, into a childlike personality and to control (or so he thought) Artemus Gordon. The hypnotizing of Nina was performed in disguise: with the backdrop of Bach's Dorian Toccata and Fugue in D-Minor, he questioned her about her studies in psychology and made a reference to regression as he spun the lampshade; as he continued to talk about regression and later actively suggested it, her attention was caught by the bright flashing light in her eyes and she unknowingly went into a trance. Once entranced she was regressed into a laughing, empty-headed girl. She was later found by West as a carefree can-can dancer in a bar, with no memory of ever meeting West previously. Torres used Nina to capture West. Dangling in front of 2 wireless remote controlled rockets, one aimed at him, the other at Grant, West freed himself in time to prevent the rockets' launch and confronted Torres by an underground river. A fight ensued as West drove the ironman into the river, where he sank like a knight in armor. In the end, Nina was returned to normal, using the same lamp, but still provocatively dressed as a dancer, which provoked a fit of rage as she didn't understand what occurred.

The name was later revived for a model produced by Ford in both Britain and Germany from 1972 to 1975. Between 1951 and 1962, the Consul was the four- cylinder base model of the three-model Ford Zephyr range, comprising Consul, Zephyr, and Zephyr Zodiac. In 1956, the line was restyled. In 1962, the Consul was replaced by the Zephyr 4, the mid-range Zephyr model becoming the Zephyr 6, and the top-of-the-range Zephyr Zodiac just being called the Zodiac. At this point, Consul became a range of smaller cars in its own right, initially the Consul Classic and Consul Capri, shortly joined by the even smaller Consul Cortina. The Consul Classic was only made for two years (August 1961 - March 1963), before being replaced by the Consul Corsair. The Consul Capri was made from October 1961 until August 1964. The Consul Classic, the Consul Capri, and the Consul Corsair (made from 1963 until 1970) were relatively short-lived, but the Ford Cortina, after losing (along with the Corsair) the \\"Consul\\" tag in 1964, went on to become a best-seller. The Consul name was again used by Ford from 1972 to 1975 on a replacement for the Zephyr range, now sharing a body with the more luxurious Ford Granada Mark I. The two-door coup√© Capri's name was also reintroduced in 1969, and survived until 1986. Ford Consul EOTA (1951‚Äì1956) The 1500 cc four-cylinder Consul was first shown at the 1950 London Motor Show. It was the start of Ford of Britain's successful attack on the family saloon car market. With stablemate Zephyr, it was the first British Ford with modern unibody construction. The Zephyr Six replaced the larger-engined V-8 Pilot which had been made in only small numbers. The Consul was given the Ford code of EOTA. Most cars were four-door saloons with body design by George Walker of the parent United States Ford Motor Company, but a few estate cars were made by the coachbuilder Abbott. From 1953, a convertible conversion by Carbodies became available. Having lost most of its strength with its roof, the unibody was reinforced by welding in a large X-frame to the floor pan. Unlike the more expensive Zephyr, the hood (convertible top) had to be put up and down manually. It was also the first car they built with up-to-date technology. The new 1508 cc engine had overhead valves, and hydraulic clutch operation was used, which in 1950 was an unusual feature. However, a three-speed gearbox, with synchromesh only on second and top, was retained. The Consul was also the first British production car to use the now-common MacPherson strut independent front suspension. The bench front seat was trimmed in PVC, and the handbrake was operated by an umbrella-style pull lever under the facia (dash). The windscreen wipers used the antiquated vacuum system, but it came from a vacuum pump linked to the camshaft-driven fuel pump instead of the induction manifold as on Ford's earlier applications of this arrangement. Clearly keen to keep things positive, a 1950 road test by the British Autocar magazine reported that the wipers were \\"free from the disadvantage of early suction-driven wipers that dried up at wide throttle opening ... and spare[d] the battery\\". The initial dashboard was a flat, symmetrical panel with interchangeable instrument cluster and glovebox, but from September 1952, a redesigned asymmetrical dashboard was fitted, and the instruments, consisting of speedometer, ammeter, and fuel gauge, were positioned in a housing above the steering column, with a full-width parcel shelf on which an optional radio could be placed. A car tested by The Motor in 1953 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 28 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£732 including taxes.

The car was still the four-cylinder submodel of the Zephyr range, with which it shared the same basic body shell. Compared with the original, it had a longer wheelbase, larger 1703 cc, engine, and a complete restyle, borrowing cues from the 1956 models of America's Thunderbird and Fairlane. One thing not updated was the windscreen wipers, which were still vacuum-operated. The roof profile was lowered in 1959 on the Mark II 'lowline' version, which also had redesigned rear lights and much of the external bright work in stainless steel. Front disc brakes with vacuum servo appeared as an option in 1960 and were made standard in 1961 (four-wheel drum brakes only, in Australia). The name became the Consul 375 in mid-1961. The convertible version made by Carbodies continued. A De Luxe version with contrasting roof colour and higher equipment specification was added in 1957. The Australian market had factory- built versions of the coup√© utility (pick up) and estate car (station wagon), as well as a locally engineered version of the saloon. They were also imported by Ford of Canada as a companion to the Falcon. A Consul Mark II tested by The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 23.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£781 including taxes. A 1960 Ford Consul Mark II was the taxi in which American singer Eddie Cochran died, and not, as many have stated, a London hackney cab.

Consul models can be identified by a two-panel cross-mesh grille as opposed to the horizontal chrome bar grille of the Granadas. Consul, Consul L, and Consul GT models were offered and were available in two-door saloon, four-door saloon, two-door coup√©, and five-door estate bodystyles. Unlike the previous Zephyr Estate, the Consul Estate was produced by Ford rather than by an outside contractor. The 1663 cc Essex V4 and 1996 cc Essex V4 with 77 and 92 hp, respectively, and a 2495 cc Essex V6 with were the power units offered in the UK. In addition, the Consul GT was powered by the 2994 cc Essex V6 engine providing . Because it was less well equipped than the similarly powered Granada, it was about lighter and correspondingly quicker. In late 1974, the Essex V4 was replaced by the 2.0 litre Pinto engine. In Germany, the Consul was offered with a choice of German-built Ford engines, starting with the 1699 cc Ford Taunus V4 engine familiar to drivers of the Ford Taunus 17M. The 2.0 litre straight-four and a 2.3 litre Cologne V6 were also available. The Consul name was discontinued in late 1975 after the UK Court of Appeal ruled that Granada Group could not prevent Ford registering the name Granada as a trademark. The Granada name was then applied to all models.

It was originally semi-annual, but switched to annual beginning with the 6th volume. Each volume represented the results of a contest, in which aspiring comic book artists from all over the U.S. each submit a 15-20 page one-shot comic. Tokyopop staff select the best entry in each genre category (Comedy, Action, Mystery, Romance, Drama, Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror) to publish in the anthology. Each winner received a $1000 prize. In addition, a People's Choice winner was decided from around 20 entries by votes from online viewers or users of the Toykopop website. The People's Choice winner was awarded $500 and published in the anthology as well (although a genre winner could also be selected as a People's Choice winner). Before the seventh RSoM competition (in 2007), the staff of TOKYOPOP picked one grand-prize winner, a Second and a Third prize winner, and eight runners-up with no distinctions in genre. The youngest entrant to become a finalist was 15 and the youngest to be published in the anthology was also 15, and the oldest had been 39. Finalists were offered a chance to submit a proposal to create a series of books, usually lasting three volumes.

Although the last Futura was part of the BF Series Ford Falcon range it was badged and marketed as the 'Ford Futura' rather than the 'Ford Falcon Futura'. Ford Australia first used the Futura name on the Ford Falcon Futura which was introduced in 1962 as the new luxury sedan in the Falcon XL Series range. The name was dropped from the XR Falcon range of 1966 and re-introduced in the XW range of 1969. It was discontinued again for the XC Series of 1976 and re-appeared in the ED range of 1993. The name was used continuously by Ford Australia from that time until the replacement of the BF Series Ford Futura by the FG Series Ford G6 in 2008. US market Logo plaque from 1960s US Futura Ford Futura was scheduled to denote a new sedan entry for the North American market in 2005 (the 2006 model year), the car it was destined for was renamed Ford Fusion while still under development, due to a trademark dispute. Futura proved to be owned by the Pep Boys auto parts chain, due to a tire line marketed by them under that brand. Ford's claim failed because the company had not used the name for more than three years. The company did use the name sporadically for several decades. In the 1950s, the Lincoln Futura show car provided the basis for the Batmobile later used in the Batman television series. In the early 1960s, the Ford Falcon had a specialty coupe submodel called Futura, and the same was true of the Ford Fairmont in the late 1970s.

It was a terror sub- group that was given autonomy under that Party. In his memoirs, group member Boris Savinkov called the group the \\"Terrorist Brigade.\\" (This phrasing was followed in his own memoirs by Whittaker Chambers, an American spy for the Soviets. ) History In 1902, Grigory Gershuni founded and led the group. In July 1904 they murdered the Russian Minister of the Interior, Vyacheslav von Plehve. In 1904, Gershuni was arrested, and Yevno Azef succeeded him, with Boris Savinkov as his deputy. Azef, a double-agent in the employ of the Tsarist secret police Okhrana, changed the Terrorist Brigade's mode of attack from firearms to dynamite.

A Ministry of Education or similar is also commonly present. Ministries are usually immediate subdivisions of the cabinet (the executive branch of the government), and subordinate to its chief executive who is called prime minister, chief minister, president, minister-president, or (federal) chancellor. During the 20th century, many countries increasingly tended to replace the term \\"ministry\\" with titles such as \\"department\\", \\"office\\", or \\"state secretariat\\". In some countries, these terms may be used with specific meanings: for example, an office may be a subdivision of a department or ministry. Examples =Canada= In Canada, five of the ten provincial governments use the term \\"ministry\\" to describe their departments (Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Alberta) but the other five, as well as the federal government, use the term \\"department\\". Despite the difference in nomenclature, both the provincial and federal governments use the term \\"minister\\" to describe the head of a ministry or department. The specific task assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her \\"portfolio\\". =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, all government organisations that consist of civil servants, and which may or may not be headed by a government minister or secretary of state, are considered to be departments. Until 2018, the term \\"ministry\\" had been retained only for the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Justice. On 8 January 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the Department of Communities and Local Government would be renamed at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to emphasise her government's prioritising of housing policy. =Other countries= Some countries, such as Switzerland, the Philippines and the United States, do not use or no longer use the term \\"ministry\\" and instead call their main government bodies \\"departments\\". In Australia at the Federal level, and also at the State level, the term \\"Ministry\\" refers to the ministerial office held by a member of Government, the executive, which is then responsible for one or more Departments, the top division of the public service. The collection of Departments responsible to a ministerial office and hence the Minister, is referred to as the Minister's \\"portfolio\\". New Zealand's state agencies include many ministries and a smaller number of departments. Increasingly, state agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments. All New Zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers, whether they are styled \\"ministries\\" or not. Each body also has an apolitical chief executive, and in ministries and departments these chief executives often have the title of Secretary. However, in other countries such as Luxembourg a department is a subdivision of a ministry, usually led by a government member called a secretary of state who is subordinate to the minister. In Hong Kong, the term \\"bureau\\" is used, and departments are subordinate to the bureaus, while in Mexico, ministries are referred to as secretariats. In Nigeria each ministry is led by a minister who is not a member of the Nigerian legislature (due to the separation of powers) and is responsible to the popularly elected President. In Lebanon, there are 21 ministries. Each ministry is led by a minister, and the Prime Minister is the 22nd minister of the Lebanese government. In the European Union, departments are termed Directorate(s)-General with the civil servant in charge called a Director-General (in the European Commission, the political head of the department is one of the European Commissioners). The government departments of the Soviet Union were named \\"People's Commissariats\\" between 1917 and 1946. In popular culture The term \\"ministry\\" has also been widely used in fiction, notably in satires and parodies. =Books and films= * The Ministry of Magic is the governing body of the wizarding world of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the Harry Potter series (not a department of the British Government responsible for magical affairs). It is led by a Minister for Magic. * In the Nineteen Eighty-Four novel there are four Ministries in charge of Airstrip One (formerly the United Kingdom), : the Ministry of Truth (education, culture and propaganda), the Ministry of Love (the interior), the Ministry of Plenty (economic affairs) and the Ministry of Peace (war and foreign affairs) . * The Ministry of Information Retrieval features in the film Brazil. * The Ministry of Social Coherence appears in an Estonian comedy Riigimehed (Statesmen). =Television= * In Yes Minister the Department of Administrative Affairs (DAA) is responsible for the administration of other government departments and the British Civil Service. This ministry had a number of other responsibilities, including National Health Service administration, local government, organising state visits by foreign leaders, enforcing European regulations, the arts and telecommunications. *The Thick of It is set at the fictional Department of Social Affairs, later called the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship. * The Ministry of Silly Walks is the subject of a sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Although the term \\"cabinet\\" can in some circumstances be a synonym, a ministry can be a broader concept which might include office-holders who do not participate in cabinet meetings. Other titles can include \\"administration\\" (in the United States) or \\"government\\" (in common usage among most parliamentary systems) to describe similar collectives. The term is primarily used to describe the successive governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which share a common political heritage. In the United Kingdom and Australia a new ministry begins after each election, regardless of whether the prime minister is re-elected, and whether there may have been a minor rearrangement of the ministry. For example, after winning the 1979 general election, Margaret Thatcher (as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) formed the first Thatcher ministry. After being re-elected at the 1983 general election, she formed the second Thatcher ministry, and so on.

The bill was intended as a parody of the American Helms‚ÄìBurton Act. The Helms‚ÄìBurton Act set up stringent punishments on any business or person that profited from property of American businesses and people that had been seized in the Cuban Revolution. The bill included a policy of punishing foreign nations and companies who had profited from this seized property (which in practice means trading with Cuba at all, since everything in Cuba is in some way connected to such property). This included a number of Canadian companies. The 1996 bill responded by calling for descendants of United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution to be able to reclaim land and property that was confiscated by the American government. The bill would have also allowed the Canadian government to exclude corporate officers, or controlling shareholders of companies that possess property formerly owned by Loyalists, as well as the spouse and minor child of such persons from entering Canada. In total some three million Canadians are descendants of United Empire Loyalists, including Milliken and Godfrey. The current value of the land and property seized during the American Revolution is many billions of dollars. The bill received widespread attention in Canada and also some publicity in the United States, including a feature on 60 Minutes. The Godfrey‚ÄìMilliken Bill did not become law. Milliken later supported Bill C-54 to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act which effectively neutralized any attempt to enforce the Helms‚ÄìBurton Act on Canadians or Canadian companies. The amendments blocked access to Canadian records for the prosecution of any case under the Helms‚ÄìBurton Act, allowed the Attorney General to block Canadian courts from enforcing judgments emanating from US jurisdictions against Canadian defendants, permitted Canadian defendants to counter-sue in Canadian courts, and imposed a $1.5 million fine (equivalent to $ million in ) to any Canadian entity that aided any prosecution under Helms‚ÄìBurton.

She was named for Thomas Stowell Phelps, who was a Rear Admiral in the US Navy in 1884. Before World War II Phelps was laid down 2 January 1934 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 18 July 1935; sponsored by Mrs. Richard A. Kearny; and commissioned 26 February 1936, Commander Albert H. Rooks in command. In November 1936 Phelps, along with the cruiser Chester, escorted the heavy cruiser Indianapolis carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Buenos Aires, Argentina for the opening of the Inter-American Peace Conference of 1936. The cruise included good-will visits to Montevideo, Uruguay and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Entry in World War II During the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Phelps shot down one enemy plane. In February and March 1942, she served as part of the destroyer screen for Task Force 11, including the carrier , in an attack in the Huon Gulf off Lae and in an attack on Salamaua, New Guinea, over the Owen Stanley mountain range from the Gulf of Papua, 10 March 1942. During the Battle of the Coral Sea beginning on 8 May, when Lexington and diverged to avoid enemy attacks, Phelps stayed with Yorktown. Phelps emerged from the battle with no casualties, but when the Lexington was seriously damaged, she helped to prevent enemy capture of the carrier by administering the coup de gr√¢ce and finished her off with two torpedoes. Aleutians and Central Pacific action In June 1942 she protected the American carriers that dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese Navy in the Battle of Midway. In August 1942 she guarded forces invading Guadalcanal. After a visit to the west coast in October, she participated in landings upon Attu, Alaska, in May 1943. After bombarding Kiska, Alaska, she provided gunfire support for landings at Makin Atoll in November 1943. In the Marshall Islands campaign in February 1944, she bombarded Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In March she guarded tankers during a strike on the Palau Islands. In June she bombarded Saipan to protect American forces that had landed there on the 15th. Atlantic duty Following duty at Saipan, she steamed via the Panama Canal to Charleston, South Carolina, for armament alterations, arriving 2 August. Departing Norfolk, Virginia, in November, she escorted a convoy to Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria. After three more convoy escort voyages to the Mediterranean in 1945, she arrived at New York, New York 10 June. Decommissioning The Phelps was decommissioned on 6 November 1945, and she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 28 January 1947. She was scrapped shortly afterwards by Northern Metals Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Battle honors Phelps received twelve battle stars for World War II service.

It was widely hailed upon its release in 1985 for its ease of use, but is generally considered one of the leading factors in the demise of the company. History and development In the 1980s, Infocom was widely known as a computer game developer and publisher. It developed the most popular works of interactive fiction available at the time and, in fact, can be considered a pioneer of the genre. However, games were only considered a \\"jumping off\\" point for the company. Infocom was originally established as an outlet to develop \\"serious\\" products. Before forming the company, several of the founders had created the game Zork on mainframes while attending or working at MIT. When they joined to form Infocom, Zork was a natural choice as a first product because it was practically complete and didn't require much up-front funding. The enormous success of the game and its \\"sequels\\" (which were actually the other portions of the original mainframe game, which had been split into pieces that early personal computers could handle) led to the development of more interactive titles, due in large part to the highly portable technology the company developed for intelligent parsing. Despite the overwhelming success of its numerous game titles, the original founders of Infocom were still intent on developing serious titles. In addition, business software was seen as more lucrative than game titles since business traditionally paid thousands of dollars for each copy of software applications. After some deliberation, Infocom's board of directors decided to develop a relational database application for business users. =Contemporary databases= Database applications contemporary with Cornerstone were fairly inaccessible to non- programmers. The leading database application of the day, dBase II, required complex command-line commands even for the simplest operations. The Cornerstone developers were determined to make ease-of-use their chief priority. Dozens of people were hired in programming, marketing and other areas to swell Infocom's ranks to over 100 employees. =Funding= While development of Cornerstone was going well, it required an enormous amount of capital. Infocom borrowed heavily and used a sole source of venture capital. Profits from their interactive fiction titles were diverted to help fund Cornerstone, a move that disturbed many employees of the game division and led to an adversarial attitude towards the business division among some. =Design decisions= One development decision that proved fateful for the product--and the company as a whole--was the decision to make Cornerstone run via a virtual machine (VM). The use of Infocom's \\"Z-machine\\" for its interactive titles had been a huge boon: since all the games were written in an intermediate language (called ZIL), the company could release one title for every major platform simultaneously. The developers hoped to do the same for Cornerstone and its subsequent products. The existing VM proved unsuitable for the database application, so a new one was written for the product. The developers produced the VM for the IBM PC first, planning to write VMs for other platforms after the initial PC release. Reception When Cornerstone was released in 1985, it was widely hailed as a giant leap forward in usability. All commands were menu-driven, an innovative feature at the time. Many powerful features never before seen were available, such as command-completion and context-sensitive help. One PC Week columnist wrote, \\"Cornerstone is the best program I have ever used... the program is so easy to use, explaining its use is almost redundant. If you need a relational database, buy Cornerstone.\\" One significant achievement noted by reviewers was that Infocom was able to contain the entire program on one floppy disk, a bonus provided by their use of their custom virtual machine (in addition to other facilities, it compressed text). However, Infocom's use of a VM affected performance. For simple operations, Cornerstone's performance was fine. However, for intensive operations, such as importing text files and sorting, Cornerstone dragged, especially when compared to the dominant database available at the time of Cornerstone's release, dBase III. One review noted that after waiting over three hours for a single text file to be imported, all similar benchmark tests were abandoned. Additionally, users of dBase III, despite needing to use complex command-line commands, were able to repurpose databases for whatever uses they needed. They could even make stand-alone applications which used databases with the package. Macros could also be developed which automated many complex or repetitive tasks. Cornerstone, though it had many built-in convenience functions, wasn't programmable. Some repetitive and complex tasks needed to be carried out by hand. Also, any operations on its databases needed to be carried out within the application; Cornerstone had no facilities for creating stand-alone specially purposed applications. While Infocom's use of a VM was a boon in some ways, the most significant advantage of its use ‚Äì easy portability ‚Äì was no longer an issue. During Cornerstone's development, the IBM PC and its clones had emerged as the dominant business computer. While portability was still important for games, a business application could be successful running only on the PC. The product's slow operation due to the VM was too great a disadvantage compared to other current offerings. These failings may not have proved fatal were it not for the climate in which the product was released. In 1985, the computer industry took a serious downturn and many businesses that may have been potential customers were reluctant or unable to justify the purchase of the program. Cornerstone sold just 10,000 copies. This may not have proven lethal to the company had game sales remained strong, but the industry downturn also affected Infocom's game sales. Their sales performance was not as good as projected and the revenue provided by games was not enough to cover the development costs of the database. Though the company's revenue for the year was over US$10 million, it was far short of what was needed to keep the company solvent. As a final blow, the industry's slump caused several of Infocom's creditors to call in their loans early. Infocom's recently burgeoning ranks of employees suffered waves of layoffs and pay reductions. Impact on Infocom In 1986, Infocom was acquired by Activision, a large developer and publisher. Activision paid off Infocom's outstanding debt as part of the deal. While the acquisition kept Infocom afloat for a few more years, poor management decisions led Activision to close Infocom for good in 1989.

He was an English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, followed by Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music. During his tenure at Columbia University he formulated the General Honors Course‚Äîresponsible for inspiring the influential Great Books movement. He published over 100 books, novels, criticism, and essays including his most important essay, The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent (1915). Early life and education Erskine was born in New York City, New York, the son of Eliza Jane (n√©e Hollingsworth) and James Morrison Erskine. and raised in Weehawken, New Jersey.John Erskine biography at The Weehawken Time Machine He graduated from Columbia University, B.A., 1900, M.A. 1901 and Ph. D., 1903 and D. Litt. 1929, besides D. Litt. degree from Amherst in 1923. Career Professor Erskine was English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, and subsequently taught at Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. In 1910, he led foundation of the Boar's Head Society for literature. In 1920, he instituted Columbia College's General Honors Course, a two-year undergraduate seminar that would later help inspire \\"Masterworks of Western Literature,\\" now known commonly as \\"Literature Humanities,\\" the second component of Columbia College's Core Curriculum. This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent. He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like Mark Van Doren and later after 1923, Mortimer Adler took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the Great Books movement, centered on the Great Books of the Western World. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join University of Chicago, where he continued to work on the theme with Robert Hutchins, President of the University. Together they subsequently went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. Erskine co-wrote the 1900 Varsity Show at Columbia, writing the musical score for The Governor's Vrouw (1900), a two-act comic opera by Henry Sydnor Harrison and poet Melville Cane, who also wrote the lyrics.The Governor's vrouw : a comic opera in two acts, by John Erskine, Henry Sydnor Harrison, Melville Cane. Publisher: New York : Luckhardt & Belder, 1900. He won the Butler Medal in 1919. During his career Erskine published over 100 books, though as a writer he first received acclaim with his novel The Private Life of Helen of Troy (1925). This novel was made into a silent film by the same the name in 1927, directed by Alexander Korda. Other films based on his works included A Lady Surrenders (1930) by John M. Stahl, Bachelor of Arts (1934) by Louis King and The President's Mystery (1936) directed by Phil Rosen. The 1956 biopic of French noblewoman Diane de Poitiers entitled Diane was based on his story with a screenplay by Christopher Isherwood. He was also the author of numerous publications, including several humorous novels retelling myths and legends, besides essays, criticism, and two volumes of autobiography. These included Penelope's Man and Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better.Reid, Robin Anne.(2009). Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews. ABC-CLIO, p.37 . Erskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist and musician. He wrote several books of music and the libretto for George Antheil's opera Helen Retires (1931), which was based on The Private Life of Helen of Troy. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music from 1928 to 1937. He was also director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, which runs the Metropolitan Opera, a noted opera company based in New York City. Erskine is also credited with writing the subtitles for a number of films, including Sacha Guitry's Le Roman d'un tricheur (The Story of a Cheat) in 1938, Marcel Pagnol's The Baker's Wife in 1940 and Mario Camerini's The Spirit and the Flesh, an adaptation of Alessandro Manzoni's classic novel The Betrothed, in 1948. To commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of Roger Bacon, Erskine wrote A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century, a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by Columbia University Press in 1914. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers. In 1946 he served as the first chairman of the American Writers Association. Personal life He was married twice to Pauline Ives (m. 1910‚Äì1945) and Helen Worden Erskine (m. 1946‚Äì1951). With his wife Pauline (Ives), he was the grandfather of actress Lindsay Crouse and the great-grandfather of actress Zosia Mamet. He died on June 2, 1951, in New York at the age of 71. Erskine Place, a street in Co-op City in the New York City borough of The Bronx, was named after him.

Nova Distribution, 2008. Definition Rael's book Geniocracy: Government of the People, for the People, by the Geniuses (Printed for the first time in English: 2008 Nova Distribution.) The term geniocracy comes from the word genius, and describes a system that is designed to select for intelligence and compassion as the primary factors for governance. While having a democratic electoral apparatus, it differs from traditional liberal democracy by instead suggesting that candidates for office and the body electorate should meet a certain minimal criterion of problem-solving or creative intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Ra√´lians are 50% above the mean for an electoral candidate and 10% above the mean for an elector. =Justifying the method of selection= This method of selectivity is deliberate so as to address what the concept considers to be flaws in the current systems of democracy. The primary object of criticism is the inability of majoritarian consensus to provide a reasonable platform for intelligent decision making for the purpose of solving problems permanently. Geniocracy's criticism of this system is that the institutions of democracy become more concerned with appealing to popular consensus through emotive issues than they are in making long-term critical decisions, especially those that may involve issues not immediately relevant to the electorate. It asserts that political mandate is something far too important to simply leave to popularity, and asserts that the critical decision making required for government, especially in a world of globalization, cannot be based on criteria of emotive or popular decision making. In this respect, Geniocracy derides liberal democracy as a form of \\"Mediocracy\\". In a geniocracy Earth would be ruled by a worldwide Geniocratic government.Sitting down with Raelians, awaiting aliens, South Florida Sun- Sentinel. 10 September 2001. Retrieved 6 October 2007. (highlight) Agenda Part of the geniocratic agenda is to promote the idea of a world government system, deriding the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of globalisation, such as environmentalism, social justice, human rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Economic Humanitarianism. =Response to criticism= As a response to its controversial attitudes about selectivity, one of the more general responses is to point out that universal suffrage, the current system, already discriminates to some degree and varyingly in different countries, in who is allowed to vote. Primarily, this discrimination is against minors, foreigners, incarcerated felons, and the mentally incapacitated. This is on the basis that their ability to contribute to the decision making process is either flawed or invalid for the purpose of the society. =Status= The current difficulty in the ideas of geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill- defined. One idea offered by Ra√´l in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge. Other components deemed necessary for a more rounded understanding of intelligence include concepts like emotional intelligence. As such, geniocracy's validity cannot really be assessed until better and more objective methods of intelligence assessment are made available. The matter of confronting moral problems that may arise is not addressed in the book Geniocracy; many leaders may be deeply intelligent and charismatic (having both high emotional/social intelligence and IQ) according to current means of measuring such factors, but no current scientific tests are a reliable enough measure for one's ability to make humanitarian choices (although online tests such as those used by retail chains to select job applicants may be relevant). The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies. Because of the controversies surrounding geniocracy, Ra√´l presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.Raelians and Cloning: Are They for Real?, Zenit News Agency. 16 January 2003. Retrieved 25 March 2007. =Democratically defined regions= The author of Geniocracy recommends (though does not necessitate) a world government with 12 regions. Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of. After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied. While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.

Its address is 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. The building was completed in 1977 with a total of of working space. It houses the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Honolulu Division), the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Senators, the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Representatives for Hawaii's 1st congressional district and Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, and branch offices of the United States Secret Service, United States Probation, Department of Homeland Security, United States Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, among other entities. The building was named after Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole, heir to the throne of the overthrown Kingdom of Hawaii, who served as Republican territorial delegate to the United States Congress from 1903 through 1922. It was built on part of the former US Army Fort Armstrong, which was named for Samuel C. Armstrong (1839‚Äì1893), son of Hawaiian missionaries. Across Ala Moana Boulevard is the Aloha Tower at the Honolulu harbor. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies. The Prince K≈´hi≈ç Building was constructed to replace the aging Federal Court, Customs House and Post Office building fronting  ªIolani Palace and adjacent to Alii≈çlani Hale which had been built in 1922 and expanded in 1931. After being mostly vacant, the old building was renovated and put up for sale. The old building was given back to the state of Hawaii and was renamed the King David KalƒÅkaua Building in December 2003. Construction of the Prince K≈´hi≈ç Federal Building was not without controversy. The General Services Administration wanted a simple tall office tower, while local architects argued for a building more appropriate to Hawaii. Statutes provided that all buildings between the shoreline and the foot of Punchbowl Crater could not be taller than the Hawaii State Capitol. The federal government, not legally limited by local statutes, defied the statutes and constructed the building as the tallest structure in the path of the capitol building's view of the shoreline. The complex includes ten stories of offices (including a penthouse level), connected by an enclosed bridge to a six-story courthouse building (including basement). The Prince K≈´hi≈ç Federal Building was designed by Joseph G.F. Farrell's firm Architects Hawaii. Other government buildings designed by the firm include the capitol building of Palau, which opened in 2006. The building was selected for $121 million of renovations as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The plan is to make the building more efficient by upgrading its mechanical, electrical, fire-safety, and plumbing systems. It had already been cited as an efficient building by the Energy Star program. Traces of asbestos were discovered during the first phase. The second phase of construction was approved in March 2011.

The concentration of mostly retail businesses on N 55th Street near Meridian Avenue is known variously as Tangletown or Meridian and considered by some to be more closely associated with Greenlake than Wallingford. The likely source for the name Tangletown is the irregular configuration of Seattle' s street grid in this transition zone, where Wallingford shades into the Green Lake neighborhood, some of which follow the contours of Green Lake, others conforming to the city's basic grid. An alternative explanation is that the neighborhood was given the name Tangletown years ago, when a streetcar interchange occupied the space where businesses and condominiums now stand. Meridian sometimes refers to a wider neighborhood than Tangletown, which refers strictly to the retail district.

In 1938, the building housed the Barclay's Grocery, Kenwood Market and Sires Brother's Paint Company. From 1956 it became the longstanding Lamont's Food Center until the 1980s when it was converted to the Honey Bear Bakery, while the East side of the building became the M&R; Grocer.

A lifelong friend of William Morris, he designed tiles, stained glass and furniture for Morris & Co. from 1863 to 1872. His tiles are often based on medieval designs or Islamic patterns, and he experimented with innovative glazes and firing techniques. Galleons and fish were popular motifs, as were \\"fantastical\\" birds and other animals. Many of De Morgan's tile designs were planned to create intricate patterns when several tiles were laid together.

At the age of twenty, he entered the Royal Academy schools, but he was swiftly disillusioned with the establishment. Then he met Morris and through him the Pre-Raphaelite circle. Soon De Morgan began experimenting with stained glass, ventured into pottery in 1863, and by 1872 had shifted his interest wholly to ceramics, initially working in Fitzroy Square. In 1872, De Morgan set up a pottery works in Chelsea where he stayed until 1881 ‚Äî his most fruitful decade as an art potter. The arts and crafts ideology he was exposed to through his friendship with Morris and his own insistent curiosity, led De Morgan to begin to explore every technical aspect of his craft. His early efforts at making his own tiles during his Chelsea Period were of variable technical quality ‚Äì often amateurish with firing defects and irregularities. In his early years, De Morgan made extensive use of blank commercial tiles. Hard and durable biscuit tiles of red clay were obtained from the Patent Architectural Pottery Co. in Poole. Dust pressed tiles of white earthenware were bought from Wedgwood, Mintons and other manufacturers but De Morgan believed these would not stand frost. He continued to use blank commercial dust-pressed tiles which were decorated in red lustre into his Fulham Period (1888‚Äì1907). However he developed a high-quality biscuit tile of his own, which he admired for its irregularities and better resistance to moisture. His inventive streak led him to spend hours designing a duplex bicycle gear and lured him into complex studies of the chemistry of glazes, methods of firing, and pattern transfer. De Morgan's decoration of pottery included chargers, rice dishes and vases. Some of these were made in his works, but many were bought as biscuit ware from Wedgwood and others and decorated by De Morgan's workers. Some were signed by his decorators including Charles Passenger, Fred Passenger, Joe Juster and Miss Babb.William Gaunt and M. D. E. Clayton-Stamm. 'William De Morgan', Studio Vista, London 1971, p. 168. William De Morgan (c. 1890), Sands Ends Pottery: a tile inspired by Middle East examples. Persian ware display at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery De Morgan was particularly drawn to Eastern tiles. Around 1873‚Äì1874, he made a striking breakthrough by rediscovering the technique of lustreware (marked by a reflective, metallic surface) found in Hispano-Moresque pottery and Italian maiolica. Nor was his interest in the East limited to glazing techniques, but it permeated his notions of design and colour as well. As early as 1875, he began to work in earnest with a \\"Persian\\" palette: dark blue, turquoise, manganese purple, green, Indian red, and lemon yellow, Study of the motifs of what he referred to as \\"Persian\\" ware (and what we know today as 15th and 16th-century ƒ∞znik ware), profoundly influenced his unmistakable style, in which fantastic creatures entwined with rhythmic geometric motifs float under luminous glazes. Evelyn The pottery works was beset by financial problems, despite repeated cash injections from his wife, the pre-Raphaelite painter Evelyn De Morgan (n√©e Pickering), and a partnership with the architect Halsey Ricardo. This partnership was associated with a move for the factory from Merton Abbey to Fulham in 1888. During the Fulham period De Morgan mastered many of the technical aspects of his work that had previously been elusive, including complex lustres and deep, intense underglaze painting that did not run during firing. However, this did not guarantee financial success, and in 1907 William De Morgan left the pottery, which continued under the Passenger brothers, the leading painters at the works. \\"All my life I have been trying to make beautiful things,\\" he said at the time, \\"and now that I can make them nobody wants them.\\" William De Morgan turned his hand to writing novels, and became better known than he ever had been for his pottery. His first novel, Joseph Vance, was published in 1906, and was an instant sensation in the United States as well as the United Kingdom. This was followed by An Affair of Dishonour, Alice-for-Short, and the two-volume It Never Can Happen Again (1909).XIX Century Fiction, Part I (Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019). The genre has been described as \\"Victorian and suburban\\". William De Morgan died of trench fever in London in 1917, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. Recollections of William De Morgan praise him for his personal warmth and the indomitable energy with which he pursued his kaleidoscopic career as designer, potter, inventor and novelist. Museums and collections De Morgan's grave in Brookwood Cemetery Collections of De Morgan's work exist in many museums, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the William Morris Gallery in London, a substantial and representative collection in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and a small but well-chosen collection along with much other pottery at Norwich. There was an exhibition of his work and of that of his wife, Evelyn, at the De Morgan Centre in Wandsworth, London (part of Wandsworth Museum) from 2002 until 2014. His Dragon Charger is in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in New Zealand. The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa has a good collection of William De Morgan's work given by Ruth Amelia Jackson in 1997 but much of it is kept in store. De Morgan's work is also present in many major collections with decorative art including the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada, the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris, Manchester Art Gallery and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. A number of properties in the UK open to the public have tiles and pottery on display or incorporated in the building's decoration. They include Wightwick Manor (the National Trust, Wolverhampton), Standen (the National Trust, East Grinstead), Blackwell (Lakeland Arts Trust, Windermere), Leicester Secular Hall and Leighton House (London Borough of Kensington). Long-term loans of artworks from the De Morgan Collection can be seen at Cannon Hall at Cawthorne in Barnsley, with a selection of both William's and Evelyn's work on display in the exhibition \\"A Family of Artists\\", and at Watts Gallery in Surrey and in the new De Morgan Collection exhibition in the Malthouse Gallery at Wightwick Manor, a National Trust Arts & Crafts house in Woverhampton. A selection of ceramics from the De Morgan Collection is on long-term loan to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

The ribbon is awarded to any member of the Air Force who completes a standard contingency deployment. The regulations of the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon define a deployment as either forty-five consecutive days or ninety non- consecutive days in a deployed status. Temporary duty orders also qualify towards the ninety-day time requirement. For deployments exceeding 45‚Äì90 days, a single Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon will be awarded for the entire time frame rather than issuing multiple awards for the same period of deployed service. Gold frame As a quasi combat action ribbon, for those service members who serve in designated combat zones and participate in combat operations, a gold frame, which the Air Force refers to as a gold border, may be attached to the AFESR basic ribbon. However, it can also be awarded to those who serve in areas where the service member receives hostile fire pay and supports combat operations. The gold border is issued as a one-time award only, regardless of the number of combat operations in which a service member serves. The Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with gold border may also be awarded to certain \\"over-the horizon\\" combat assignments, such as remotely piloted vehicle operators for employing a long-range weapon into a combat zone. It is therefore possible to earn the gold border even when stationed at a secure military installation in the United States geographically separated from the battlefield by thousands of miles. Such personnel, however, must have first earned the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon before the ribbon can be upgraded with a gold border. Additional awards of the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon are denoted by oak leaf clusters and the award is retroactive to October 1, 1999. Symbolism The center stripe is light blue and stands for Air Force capability. From this center stripe outward on each side, the narrow white stripe stands for integrity; ultramarine blue represents worldwide deployment; Air Force yellow stands for excellence, and the last two stripes (scarlet and blue) stand for the United States.

Early life Robert Carr was educated at Westminster School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences, graduating in 1938. After graduation he applied his knowledge of metallurgy at John Dale & Co, the family metal engineering firm. A collapsed lung kept him from war service but his firm specialised in the construction of airframes for Lancaster bombers. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/20/lord-carr- of-hadley Political career He was elected Member of Parliament for Mitcham in 1950 and served there until 1974 when the seat was merged and he moved to Carshalton. In Edward Heath's government he served as Secretary of State for Employment and was responsible for the modernising Industrial Relations Act 1971, which balanced the introduction of compensation for unfair dismissal with curbs on the freedom to strike and the virtual abolition of closed shop agreements. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 was deeply disliked by the trade unions whose industrial action lead to the three day week and ultimately to the defeat of the government. The victorious Labour Party promptly repealed the Industrial Relations Act, replacing it with their own Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 which, while scrapping the \\"offensive\\" provisions, effectively re-enacted the remainder of Carr's 1971 Act. In 1971, Carr escaped injury when The Angry Brigade anarchist group exploded two bombs outside his house. More than thirty years later, a member of the group issued a public apology to Carr, and sent him a Christmas card. In 1972, Carr served a brief period as Lord President of the Council and was then appointed Home Secretary after the resignation of Reginald Maudling. After his defeat in the first ballot of the 1975 Conservative leadership contest, Edward Heath asked Carr to \\"take over the functions of leader\\" until a new leader was elected. The day after her election the new leader, Margaret Thatcher met with Carr, according to her at his request, before forming her shadow cabinet. According to her memoirs, given that Carr had been close to Heath she would have understood \\"if he did not relish the prospect of serving under\\" her. She stated that Carr made it clear that the only post he would accept would be that of Shadow Foreign Secretary. She told him that she could not promise this and confided in her memoirs that, at that stage when she was still considering appointments, she was \\"not convinced\\" she would offer Carr any role in the shadow cabinet. She proceeded to appoint Maudling as Shadow Foreign Secretary and saw Carr again later to inform him of her decision. In her memoirs she speculated that Carr might have been \\"persuaded to stay in another capacity\\", but she did not offer him the chance and noted that \\"I was not keen to have another strong opponent in any position on the team\\". Later life Carr was created a life peer as Baron Carr of Hadley, of Monken Hadley, North London, in 1976. Death Carr died 17 February 2012 at the age of 95 years. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Peters Church, in the Gloucestershire village of Farmington. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and two daughters.

The band line-up consisted of core members Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison, while former members included Ben Graves, Acey Slade, Eric Griffin and Tripp Eisen. The band has released two albums, the first in the form of Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls which was released in 2002. The band had limited initial success in the United States, though their album and singles charted well in the United Kingdom and around the same time they picked up a strong following in Japan. Their second album, Women and Children Last, was released August 31, 2010. Wednesday 13 confirmed the band's split in an interview in July 2013. Characteristics The sound of the band is made up of their shared influences, which musically are punk rock and as well as from some of the 1970s hard rock acts (such as Kiss and Alice Cooper). The band also share a large interest in horror movies, from which they take most of their images and references. Lyrically, the group most often present themselves in a \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" manner, covering topics of necrophilia, grave robbing, cross-dressing, amongst other things. The Murderdolls are often described as \\"M√∂tley Cr√ºe meets the Misfits\\" by critics and fans alike. Biography =Early years= Some consider the Murderdolls history to go back as far as 1994 to a Des Moines, Iowa based band Joey Jordison played in, named The Rejects, which was fronted by vocalist Dizzy Draztik. The sound of the band was somewhat comparable to what the Murderdolls would later develop, minus the horror themed lyrics. The Rejects split up as Jordison's \\"other band\\" Slipknot were signed to a major label. During the 1999 Ozzfest tour, Jordison met Tripp Eisen and asked him if he was interested in a project he had in mind; the reforming of the Rejects with Draztik. Eisen agreed to join the project and a friend of his from the band Dope and previously the Genitorturers, Racci Shay played drums with them. Also a bassist named Ian, who had played in New York based band the Vampire Love Dolls (fronted by Acey Slade who was known as J at the time), played with them live. =Formation, Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls (2001‚Äì2002)= Dizzy Draztik introduced Joey Jordison to the music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, a horror punk band from Charlotte, North Carolina, fronted by vocalist Wednesday 13. Draztik persuaded the band to invite the Drag Queens frontman to play with the Rejects. The pair had previously considered bringing Wednesday 13 into the band before Eisen joined. Wednesday joined them on November 2001, where he was brought into the Rejects as a bassist. Tripp Eisen has claimed that he suggested that his friend Acey Slade was brought into the band around this time, but was turned down. Soon, Wednesday 13 was moved to the frontman position after Dizzy left the band to take care of his ailing mother. The band changed their name to the Murderdolls and would soon adopt a horror themed approach. In fact, in terms of material used Wednesday 13 became the driving force for it. Most of the tracks on the Murderdolls debut album were covers from his previous band Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. These covers which would later introduce a whole new audience to the past music of Wednesday 13. Wednesday 13, Jordison and Eisen went into the recording studio to record a demo consisting on an albums worth of material. This demo ended up becoming the band's first album. Because of the association of Eisen and Jordison's other bands, was to be released on Roadrunner Records. Primarily the recording features Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison playing all of the instruments and vocals, however Eisen recorded most of the guitar solos on it. Around this time in late March 2002, Ben Graves and Eric Griffin, two musicians native of Boston, Massachusetts but were living in Hollywood, California at the time joined the Murderdolls. They were brought in after Eisen showed Jordison a video of himself jamming with the pair, they decided the duo would be right for the band. And although they would feature on the debut album artwork, they did not actually play on the album itself. The band played their first show together as the Murderdolls on July 30, 2002 at San Diego's Epicenter club. An EP was released in early 2002 named Right to Remain Violent and featured some tracks from the forthcoming album. The full-length album soon followed, titled Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls. The initial release featured fifteen tracks; twelve in total had previously been recorded by Wednesday 13 with Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 and one from his earlier band Maniac Spider Trash. 13 did however write all of the aforementioned tracks himself. The song \\"Welcome to the Strange\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the movie Freddy vs. Jason. This track was later available as a bonus track on an expanded release of the debut album along with the single White Wedding; a Billy Idol cover. Upon its release the Murderdolls album was promoted to the public as the \\"other band\\" of Joey Jordison, the drummer of Slipknot, or a \\"collaboration\\" between Jordison and Tripp Eisen. At the time Wednesday 13's importance as songwriter wasn't known by the public. The lead single from the album was titled \\"Dead in Hollywood\\", the promotional video featured a guest appearance by Marilyn Manson, who had previously become friends with Jordison and was returning the favour of him earlier appearing in the video for \\"Tainted Love\\". In July 2002 Eisen announced he was leaving the band and returning to his main band Static-X as they were due to record a new album at the time. Eisen's former Dope bandmate Acey Slade was brought in to replace him on guitar. =Touring (2002‚Äì2004)= The first tour dates of the Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls World Tour took the band through parts of the United States including; Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Jordison's native Iowa. Their first major date was at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan during August 18, 2002, two days before their debut album was released. This helped them gain a fan base in Japan. Following this they played some dates in Europe, including a tour of the United Kingdom with AntiProduct (the lead singer of which, Alex Kane, replaced Griffin on Bass, when he had to return home during the tour) and Ireland. Their restless touring continued throughout 2002 into 2003, where they played in several major festivals; first, they played at the Australian festival Big Day Out, going on after Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters headlined the event. They were received favorably and one reviewer commented on the band's performance as a \\"mangled, choked and psychotic version of the Sex Pistols.\\" The other major festival dates during this time were Download Festival and Rock am Ring, Iron Maiden headlined both of the festivals. Special Edition 2003 cover of Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls Together, the band recorded a cover version of Billy Idol's \\"White Wedding\\". A promotional video was recorded for it, in which they mocked popstar singing contests such as the Idol series. It was released as a single in the United Kingdom and they even performed it on the premier UK chart show, Top of the Pops. Mid 2003 The Murderdolls co-headlined a tour of England with fellow Roadrunner Records band, Stone Sour, which contained two of Jordison's fellow members of Slipknot; Corey Taylor and James Root. Murderdolls toured at the end of 2003 in support of the single and the re-release of their debut, which included their Billy Idol cover as well as five other bonus tracks and b-sides: \\"Let's Fuck'\\", \\"I Take Drugs\\", \\"Crash Crash\\", \\"Welcome to the Strange\\" and \\"I Love to Say Fuck\\". The latter two had previously been recorded by Wednesday 13 with the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. The tour went through many European countries including Spain, Italy, Croatia, and Scandinavian countries before ending with a four date tour of the UK supported by English psychobilly band Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster. Murderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004 in Corona, California. After this they went on an indefinite hiatus with Jordison returning to Slipknot. Since the hiatus begun, both Wednesday 13 and Jordison maintained that the band had not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album together in the future.Official Wednesday 13 band's myspace blog: Thursday, June 11, 2009. \\"Still no def plans but there is talk between Joey and I on a new Murderdolls CD. Keep your fingers crossed, only time will tell.\\" Additionally, in a 2009 interview, Slade revealed that he would have been happy to reform the Murderdolls by now, but it always proves impossible due to other commitments of the band members. =Reunion & Women & Children Last and break-up (2010‚Äì2011)= In February 2010, whilst embarking on a solo tour in Australia, Wednesday 13 spoke with Drum Media and told them he was tossing up whether to record another solo album or record another Murderdolls album. He stated that the idea was still in talks, but would be his number one priority if the opportunity arose. In March 2010, Jordison officially revealed to Kerrang magazine that Murderdolls had officially reunited with him and Wednesday working with producer Chris \\"Zeuss\\" Harris. Jordison said about the reunion, \\"It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... Fuck formula! Fuck the norm!\\" It was revealed on the band's official website that the band would feature a new line-up without Slade, Griffin or Graves. Drummer Racci Shay joined the band alongside guitarist Roman Surman and bassist Jack Tankersley. M√∂tley Cr√ºe guitarist Mick Mars recorded a guest appearance on the new album, whilst he was recording material for his debut solo album in the same space. On April 15, the band confirmed that they had finished recording their upcoming album Women & Children Last. Joey Jordison has said that he considers Women & Children Last as really the first true Murderdolls album. The band was expected to embark on a tour of North America, but the idea was scrapped after Jordison began touring with Rob Zombie on the Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour and after the untimely death of his Slipknot bandmate Paul Gray. This led to the band performing only two shows in California in mid-June to promote their new album. The first show was captured on video and was released on DVD for the special edition of the album. Jordison resumed touring with Zombie in early July. For Women & Children Last, Jordison and Wednesday 13 confessed to VerdamMnis Magazine that they consider this new release to be their very first album, as this is the first time they \\"sat down together to write songs and the production is a far better than from Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls. They also revealed to the magazine that the CD was recorded in a mansion upon the Hollywood Hills, which encouraged them \\"to create their own sound with no influence from the outside world\\", as they were secluded. The album was released on August 31, 2010 through Roadrunner Records. The band promoted the album on the Women & Children Last World Tour, on which they supported Guns N' Roses on a handful of European dates, performed on the main stage at the UK edition of the Ozzfest, supported Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper on the Halloween Hootenanny Tour (Jordison performed double duty with Zombie and the Murderdolls), and performed on Fuel TV's The Daily Habit. The band was expected to embark upon a headlining tour of North America in December, followed by a tour of the United Kingdom in January, before returning to Australia for the first time in 8 years to co-headline the Soundwave Festival. The band announced that, along with their North America tour, Violent Night, Deadly Night Tour, they were releasing a music video for the song \\"Nowhere\\" from Women & Children Last on November 29, 2010. However, On November 29, 2010, it was announced that the Violent Night, Deadly Night Tour was cancelled, due to family issues. The last time the Murderdolls performed together was April 24, 2011. This final gig marked the last time Joey and 13 spoke. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split for good in 2011. =Post Break Up= In 2017 Wednesday 13 stated his interest in resurrecting the Murderdolls, and that Joey may also be interested. Further speculation came in July 2018 when Jordison claimed new material was ready to go and a reunion could happen when the time was right.https://metalinjection.net/latest-news/rumors/joey-jordison-says- murderdolls-have-new-material-never-say-never-to-reunion/amp However, in a February 2019 interview, Wednesday 13 stated that no progress on a reunion had occurred and that Joey and him were still friends.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/wednesday-13-theres-been-no- discussion-of-murderdolls-activity. On May 9, 2018, former drummer Ben \\"The Ghoul\\" Graves died of cancer at the age of 45. Wednesday 13, along with former members Eric Griffin and Acey Slade performed with each other for the first time in 14 years to pay tribute to their late drummer.

It stars Robert Downey Jr. and features a supporting cast that includes Katie Holmes, Adrien Brody, Robin Wright Penn, Mel Gibson and Carla Gugino as well as a number of songs from the 1950s. Plot Suffering from the skin disease psoriasis and crippling psoriatic arthritis, detective novelist Dan Dark is in such pain in a hospital that he begins to delve into fantasy, resulting in several storylines told simultaneously: * A film noir based on Dark's novel, The Singing Detective, in which a nightclub singer/private eye, hired by Mark Binney, takes on a strange case involving prostitutes and two mysterious men. Nothing is ever solved from this, only a vague plot. Notably, all of the people in the film noir are played by people who are real people in Dark's life; for example, Dark's nurse plays a singer. * The present reality, in which Dark is tormented by incredible pain. Dark interacts with the various people around him, as the doctors and nurses attempt to help, but are dismissed by Dark's anger and bitterness towards everyone. His sense of reality then collapses into hallucinations as the people randomly sing choreographed musical numbers, such as \\"How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?\\" In the end, his reality is blended with the film noir and he is abducted by the two mysterious men, only to be shot by the titular \\"singing detective\\". * Dark's traumatic childhood in the past, which explains Dark's repulsion toward sexuality (Dark had watched his mother have sex with other men, including his father's business partner), and his own fiery temper. Cast Production Potter's screenplay had been circulating in Hollywood for many years as Potter was enthusiastic about a film version. Robert Altman was at one time attached to direct with Dustin Hoffman in the lead, but financing proved difficult and the production was shelved. It was eventually discovered by an executive at Mel Gibson's production company Icon Productions, who loved it and got Gibson on board to produce. The screenplay had also been imagined as a horror film directed by genre veteran David Cronenberg and starring Al Pacino as the title character. Reception The film scored a 39% \\"Rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 108 critics, with an average rating of 5.09/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Delightful performance from Robert Downey Jr. can't save The Singing Detective's transition from TV to the big screen\\". While some critics, such as Roger Ebert, liked the film, others, like Joe Baltake at the Sacramento Bee, considered it an \\"interesting failure\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack to The Singing Detective was released on October 14, 2003. It consisted of songs from the 1950s rather than the 1940s as in the original television series.

Munster is derived from the Alsace town of Munster, where, among Vosgian abbeys and monasteries, the cheese was conserved and matured in monks' cellars.  History of the cheese This cheese originated in the Admodiation, an area on the top of the Vosgian mountains of France, named \\"Chaumes\\" or \\"Les grandes Chaumes\\" (comitatus Calvomontensis). Calvomontensis is the Latin for a mountaintop without woods. As early as 1371, and possibly before, these territories were occupied by cattle herds driven by men, called \\"marcaires\\" (from the Alsatian \\"Malker\\", Milker in English), pastured there between May and September. When the herds returned to their valleys, the cattle herdsmen first paid the fees and tithes to the religious and political owners of the summer pastures or simply financiers of these migrations. During feudal times these owners possessed all goods, living creatures, rights of pasture and cattle. Those who herded were known as serfs. This mountain population paid their debts with cheese and jars of butter. The lords were the first religious establishments, women like chanoinesses from Remiremont or from Andlau, or men such as the chanoines or canons from Murbach or Saint-Di√©, Benedictines from Munster, Senones, Moyenmoutier, and other monastic areas. Political protectors included the duke of Lorraine, count of Salm, count of Ribeaupierre, and other Alsatian noblemen. During the 17th century, this tradition, though disappearing, was maintained in two special places, Gerardmer in the western Lorraine part of the main range and Munster for the east and Alsatian part. Hence the two names of this cheese, g√©r√¥m√© and Munster written with little type.  Making and affinage This cheese is protected by an Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC). This certification places the main steps of the cheese process under control. The producers are required to observe rigorously: * A limited area of milk production, including a major part of Vosges, near the mountains of Alsace; the d√©partements Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin; a few communes in d√©partement Haute-Sa√¥ne; Belfort Territory; and the cantons of d√©partements Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle. * Precise characteristics of the transformation in cheese. It is made from unpasteurized cow's milk called \\"crude\\" or raw milk, from the above-described zone d'appellation contr√¥l√©e. This soft white cheese is formed into flat cylinders, with two common dimensions: little Munster g√©r√¥m√© has a diameter; big Munster g√©r√¥m√© (commonly just called Munster) has a diameter. Munster cheese being produced * Cheese affinage The cheese's crust must be washed regularly. It is matured in damp cellars for five weeks for the smaller formats (roughly 300 g) and up to 2 to 3 months for the larger ones (about 1500 g). During this period, the rind is periodically washed with brine. The added moisture helps the development of bacteria that gives this cheese its particular taste and color. * Quality control is maintained in storage, packaging and labeling (called etiquetage). The cheese, now round with a fat content of 45% in dry matter, has a diameter between 12 and , and a thickness between and . Normally it is sold unwrapped on a straw bed, but for export it may be wrapped in cellophane or clear plastic. The cheese should have a slick shiny brick-colored or orange rind, with apparent moisture on it; a semi-soft body; a very strong and penetrating odor; and a very strong taste. Defects can be an unripened body (crumbly), a broken rind, too salty or too old and overdone. Munster g√©rom√© is at its best in the summer and the autumn, when it is made from milk from the haute chaumes (\\"high stubble\\") of pastures that have already been mowed for midsummer hay in the Vosges mountains. The best cheeses, in some people's opinion, come from the haute vall√©e de Munster itself, but this cheese is also made in Lapoutroie, Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, Vill√©, and other villages practically or in western Vosges, in Lorraine. Local opinions vary greatly on the best source according to their individual tastes.

Retrieved 2011-06-28. Since its release, Gibson has released numerous variations of and other models based on the design of the ES-335. Notable users of the ES-335 or one of its variations include Chuck Berry; Bob Weir; Alvin Lee; Larry Carlton; Elliott Smith; Noel Gallagher; Marty McFly portrayed by Michael J. Fox in Back To The Future; Carl Wilson; Eric Clapton; B.B. King; Chuck Brown;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian- institution/chuck-browns-guitar-drove-wind-me-up-rhythm-180954351/ and Alex Lifeson. Origins Before 1952, Gibson produced only hollow-body guitars, which are prone to feedback when amplified loudly. That year saw the introduction of their first solid-body, the Gibson Les Paul, a significantly different instrument from Les Paul's early electric guitar experiment, \\"The Log\\", which consisted of a center block with detachable chambers on both sides, a neck, hardware, and a pickup attached. By 1958 Gibson was making a few solid-body models which had much lower feedback and better sustain but lacked the darker, warmer tone and unamplified volume of hollow bodies. The ES-335 was an attempt to find a middle ground: a warmer tone than a solid body produced with almost as little feedback. Though semi-hollow-bodies like the ES-335 are essentially a compromise of earlier designs, they are for this reason extremely flexible, as evidenced by the ES-335's popularity in a wide range of music, including blues, jazz, and rock. With a basic price of $267.50, it quickly became a best-seller, and has been in continuous production since 1958. The first major update came in mid 1962, with the most visible change being the neck markers: early models had dots (hence \\"dot neck\\"), later models had blocks. Models Some models (ES 347,ES 369) feature a coil split switch, which allows the humbuckers to produce a \\"single- coil\\" sound. The ES-335 Pro, ES-335TD CRS and CRR models were equipped with Gibson \\"Dirty Fingers\\" humbuckers, which had a significantly higher output than the standard pickups. The company has produced a number of signature guitars as well, such as Trini Lopez-inspired model (1964‚Äì1970) with narrow diamond-shaped soundholes replacing the f-holes, a Firebird-style headstock with all the tuners on one side, and slashed-diamond inlays. In September 2007, Gibson introduced the DG-335, designed in collaboration with Dave Grohl, a variation on the Trini Lopez Gibson; the Grohl model has a stopbar tailpiece and Gibson's new Burstbucker humbuckers.\\"Gibson DG-335 Inspired by Dave Grohl, Released'. Electric Guitar Review, 2007-09-28. Other signature models have included the heavily customized Alvin Lee \\"Big Red\\" 335. A reissue of the 1963 model was a 2014 \\"Editor's pick\\" in Guitar Player magazine, at $4000 Variations =Trini Lopez= Rusty Anderson plays a Trini Lopez Standard. Other than the custom black finish, this guitar has the same specs as the 1964-1971 Trini Lopez Standard. Two Trini Lopez signature models were developed based on the ES-335 model, known as the Trini Lopez Standard and the Trini Lopez Custom. They were initially produced from 1964-1971, and reissues have been produced periodically since the initial run. The Trini Lopez Standard featured the same body shape and profile as the ES-335, with diamond- shaped holes in the place of the f-shaped holes, a Gibson Firebird headstock, split diamond inlays on the fingerboard, a trapeze tailpiece with a plaque with Trini Lopez's name, and a standard cherry red finish. A modified version of the Trini Lopez Standard, with a stop-tailpiece and a custom Pelham Blue finish is used by Dave Grohl as his primary stage guitar; the Gibson Custom Shop produced a market version known as the \\"DG-335\\" in 2015. The Trini Lopez Custom came in a standard cherry sunburst finish, had a thicker body and cutout bouts with pointed tips instead of the standard rounded tips (similar to the Gibson Barney Kessel Custom guitar), a more ornate pickguard, and different locations for its two selector switches, but otherwise had the same tailpiece, fingerboard, headstock, and electronics as the Trini Lopez Standard. =ES-345= Gibson ES-345 (left-hand model) The ES-345 (semi- hollow) was first produced in 1958 as an upscale version of the ES-335. Although the design is very similar to the 335, the 345 featured a multi- position \\"Varitone\\" switch located just above the lead tone and volume controls, which added various combinations of inductors and capacitors to the electronic pickup circuit of the guitar in order to alter its resonant frequency and add \\"color\\" to the sound. The ES-345 also featured an optional stereophonic output jack, gold plated hardware, large split parallelogram fingerboard inlays (similar to ES 175), and a thicker three-ply edge binding than that of the ES-335. Notable users include Chuck Berry, B.B. King, Freddie King, Bill Nelson, Jorma Kaukonen, Fred Frith, Porl Thompson of The Cure, Steve Howe, Elvin Bishop and the character of Marty McFly in the 1985 comedy film Back to the Future. British guitar player John McLaughlin owns a Sunburst ES-345 modified with a Bigsby tailpiece and a scalloped fingerboard. https://www.johnmclaughlin.com/equipment// He played this guitar in the One Truth Band and Trio of Doom. The ES-345 was discontinued in 1981, one year after the Gibson Lucille, based on the ES-355 (see below), was launched. As of 2012, the ES-345 is available as a limited edition from Gibson's discount line, Epiphone Guitars, as well as the ES-355. The differences between two models are: * The headstock inlay on ES-345 is a \\"small crown\\" rather than the \\"split-diamond\\" custom inlay on the ES-355. * The position markers on ES-345 are \\"split parallelogram\\" rather than the \\"block\\" inlays used on the ES-355. Also, the first fret on the ES-345 is not inlaid. * The stereo output wiring and the Varitone was factory-installed on the ES-345 and ES-355TD-SV, but not on the unmodified ES-355TD (mono version). * The vibrato unit (Vibrola or Bigsby) was an option on the ES-345; In contrast, it was factory-installed on most ES-355s (except for the earlier models in the 1950s, final models after 1979, and Lucille). =ES-355= Alex Lifeson of Rush playing an ES-355 The ES-355TD (Thinline semi-hollow, Double pickups) was at the top of Gibson's range of thinline semi-hollowbody electric guitars. It was manufactured from 1958 to 1982, fitted with the Varitone Stereo option (SV), as the ES-355TD-SV released in 1959. This guitar is now available in reissues from Gibson's main line or custom shop. The headstock has a split-diamond inlay rather than the smaller crown inlay on the 335/345, in addition to a multiple-layered binding. The fingerboard inlays are inlaid mother-of-pearl blocks, beginning at the first position of the fretboard. In addition to the headstock, binding is also applied to the fretboard and both the front and the back edges of the body. Rather than the rosewood fretboard on a 335 or 345, both variations of the 355 have an ebony fingerboard for a 'smoother' sound. Reissues use a richlite fingerboard. Early models of Epiphone's limited edition budget version had an ebony fingerboard but the later issues had a rosewood board. The ES-355 was available with a Vibrola vibrato unit or a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. It was also available with a stereo output and Varitone tone filter circuitry. When fitted with the optional stereo wiring and Varitone, the model was known as the ES-355TD-SV. =Lucille (B.B. King signature model)= B.B. King with Lucille The best-known user of the ES-355 is probably B.B. King, whose trademark guitar, Lucille, was the basis for a 1981 signature model. It has the optional stereo wiring and Varitone circuitry as standard. It differs from the ES-355 by having a maple neck instead of mahogany, the name \\"Lucille\\" on the headstock, and the lack of an F-hole on its top. =EB-2 and EB-2D= Gibson EB-2 The EB-2 was first produced in 1958 as the bass version of the ES-335. Having the same body as the ES-335, it held a 30.5\\" scale neck and hardware borrowed directly from the Gibson EB-0.The pickup was actually a single coil with the polepieces on the lower edge of the black cover until mid 1959.The humbucking pickup has the poles in the center of a black cover. In 1959, a \\"baritone-switch\\" was added to filter the output from the neck humbucker and give it more of a guitar-like sound. The EB-2 was discontinued at the end of 1961, being replaced by the EB-3. Due to a boom in the use of the EB-2 and its sibling, the Epiphone Rivoli, in the Merseybeat in England in the early sixties, production restarted in 1964, with a 2-pickup version called the EB-2D being added to the line in 1966. In 1972 the EB-2 line was discontinued. =CS Series= The CS-336 is a smaller version of the ES-335. The back and sides of this guitar are constructed from a single piece of carved mahogany, and its reduced size is closer to that of the Les Paul. Also available, the CS-356 has gold plated hardware and multiple binding on the body, neck and headstock. In 2007, Gibson introduced the ES-339 with the size of the CS-336 and the laminate construction of the ES-335. = DG-335 = Dave Grohl displaying his signature Gibson DG-335 guitar, a custom model based on the 1964-1971 Gibson Trini Lopez Standard. Dave Grohl 335s is based on the Gibson ES-335. DG-335 was designed by Gibson based on the Trini Lopez Standard specs, but in a different color and with a stop tailpiece instead of the Trini Lopez's trapeze tailpiece. = Chris Cornell ES-335 = Chris Cornell 335s are based on the Gibson ES-335. The Chris Cornell ES-335 Tribute was designed by Gibson and Chris himself based on the guitars he played in the 80's and 90's, mostly Gretsch Jet models, but in Gibson's own 335 style, using the same construction of a typical 335 with the 3ply maple top, maple center block, mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, but with Lollartron‚Ñ¢ pickups in the neck and bridge, resembling the classic look on the Filter'tron‚Ñ¢ pickups, used extensively by Gretsch. Also they feature one model (Olive Dab Green) with a Bigsby B7 vibrato tailpiece and another (Satin Ebony) with a Tune O Matic tailpiece. = Epiphone = Gibson also markets a much less expensive version of the ES-335 under its Epiphone brand, called the Dot (referring to its dot- style inlay). Other Epiphone semi-hollowbody style models include the Sheraton (a fancier version of the co-developed ES-335, released the same week, it can make equal claim as the first semi-hollowbody), the Riviera, and the Dot Studio, though some of those are modeled after other guitars in the ES series. From 1958 to 1970, Epiphone guitars were produced in Gibson's Kalamazoo, MI factory, and shared the similar design, materials and electronics as their Gibson counterparts. The Riviera, Sheraton, Rivoli and Newport models shared similarities with the Gibson ES-335, EB-2 and EB-0 models, respectively. In 1970, Epiphone production ceased in the Kalamazoo plants and Epiphones were made at the Matsumoku factory in Japan. Later Epiphones were constructed under contract with Samick in Korea. These early Epiphones are generally thought to be of good quality. Since 2002, almost all Epiphones have been made in the 'Gibson' Qingdao plant in China. As of 2012, Epiphone also produces the ES-335 PRO, ES-339 PRO, ES-345 Stereo, ES-355, and the Lucille. The ES-335 Pro and ES-339 both feature coil-tapped humbuckers, activated by pull-push volume knobs; the ES-355, gold hardware and a Bigsby tremolo, while the ES-345 Stereo has a Bigsby and VariTone control. The Lucille meanwhile, also features a VariTone control and, in keeping with BB King's Gibson signature model, no f-holes and a fine tuning stop bar tailpiece. =Other= Other models based on the 335 include the ES-333, the ES-340 (the toggle switch has settings of the pickups in-phase, pickups out-of-phase and standby), the ES-347 (includes a coil tap, block markers on an ebony fretboard, fine tuning tailpiece and, on earlier models, a brass nut, and a greater sustain block), the ES-339, essentially a 335 with the body reduced to Les Paul size; and the Gibson Les Paul signature bass. Although the ES-330 resembles the 335, it is actually fully hollow (as opposed to semi-hollow) and features two P-90 pickups (as opposed to 2 humbucking pickups), and it was designed as the successor to the Gibson ES-225.

Volder), Linear CORDIC, Hyperbolic CORDIC (John Stephen Walther), and Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) (Yuanyong Luo et al.), is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, square roots, multiplications, divisions, and exponentials and logarithms with arbitrary base, typically converging with one digit (or bit) per iteration. CORDIC is therefore also an example of digit-by-digit algorithms. CORDIC and closely related methods known as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division or factor combining are commonly used when no hardware multiplier is available (e.g. in simple microcontrollers and FPGAs), as the only operations it requires are additions, subtractions, bitshift and lookup tables. As such, they all belong to the class of shift-and-add algorithms. In computer science, CORDIC is often used to implement floating-point arithmetic when the target platform lacks hardware multiply for cost or space reasons. History Similar mathematical techniques were published by Henry Briggs as early as 1624 and Robert Flower in 1771, but CORDIC is better optimized for low-complexity finite-state CPUs. CORDIC was conceived in 1956 by Jack E. Volder at the aeroelectronics department of Convair out of necessity to replace the analog resolver in the B-58 bomber's navigation computer with a more accurate and performant real- time digital solution. Therefore, CORDIC is sometimes referred to as a digital resolver. In his research Volder was inspired by a formula in the 1946 edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics: : \\\\begin{align} K_n R \\\\sin(\\\\theta \\\\pm \\\\varphi) &= R \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\pm 2^{-n} R \\\\cos(\\\\theta), \\\\\\\\\\\\ K_n R \\\\cos(\\\\theta \\\\pm \\\\varphi) &= R \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\mp 2^{-n} R \\\\sin(\\\\theta), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} with K_n = \\\\sqrt{1 + 2^{-2n}}, \\\\tan(\\\\varphi) = 2^{-n}. His research led to an internal technical report proposing the CORDIC algorithm to solve sine and cosine functions and a prototypical computer implementing it. The report also discussed the possibility to compute hyperbolic coordinate rotation, logarithms and exponential functions with modified CORDIC algorithms. Utilizing CORDIC for multiplication and division was also conceived at this time. Based on the CORDIC principle, Dan H. Daggett, a colleague of Volder at Convair, developed conversion algorithms between binary and binary-coded decimal (BCD). In 1958, Convair finally started to build a demonstration system to solve radar fix-taking problems named CORDIC I, completed in 1960 without Volder, who had left the company already. More universal CORDIC II models A (stationary) and B (airborne) were built and tested by Daggett and Harry Schuss in 1962. Volder's CORDIC algorithm was first described in public in 1959, which caused it to be incorporated into navigation computers by companies including Martin-Orlando, Computer Control, Litton, Kearfott, Lear-Siegler, Sperry, Raytheon, and Collins Radio soon. Volder teamed up with Malcolm MacMillan to build Athena, a fixed-point desktop calculator utilizing his binary CORDIC algorithm. The design was introduced to Hewlett-Packard in June 1965, but not accepted. Still, MacMillan introduced David S. Cochran (HP) to Volder's algorithm and when Cochran later met Volder he referred him to a similar approach John E. Meggitt (IBM) had proposed as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division in 1961. Meggitt's method was also suggesting the use of base 10 rather than base 2, as used by Volder's CORDIC so far. These efforts led to the ROMable logic implementation of a decimal CORDIC prototype machine inside of Hewlett-Packard in 1966, build by and conceptually derived from Thomas E. Osborne's prototypical Green Machine, a four-function, floating-point desktop calculator he had completed in DTL logic in December 1964. This project resulted in the public demonstration of Hewlett-Packard's first desktop calculator with scientific functions, the hp 9100A in March 1968, with series production starting later that year. When Wang Laboratories found that the hp 9100A used an approach similar to the factor combining method in their earlier LOCI-1 (September 1964) and LOCI-2 (January 1965) Logarithmic Computing Instrument desktop calculators, they unsuccessfully accused Hewlett-Packard of infringement of one of An Wang's patents in 1968. John Stephen Walther at Hewlett-Packard generalized the algorithm into the Unified CORDIC algorithm in 1971, allowing it to calculate hyperbolic functions, natural exponentials, natural logarithms, multiplications, divisions, and square roots. The CORDIC subroutines for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions could share most of their code. This development resulted in the first scientific handheld calculator, the HP-35 in 1972. Based on hyperbolic CORDIC, Yuanyong Luo et al. further proposed a Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) to directly compute logarithms and exponentials with an arbitrary Ô¨Åxed base in 2019. Theoretically, Hyperbolic CORDIC is a special case of GH CORDIC. Originally, CORDIC was implemented only using the binary numeral system and despite Meggitt suggesting the use of the decimal system for his pseudo-multiplication approach, decimal CORDIC continued to remain mostly unheard of for several more years, so that Hermann Schmid and Anthony Bogacki still suggested it as a novelty as late as 1973 and it was found only later that Hewlett-Packard had implemented it in 1966 already. Decimal CORDIC became widely used in pocket calculators, most of which operate in binary-coded decimal (BCD) rather than binary. This change in the input and output format did not alter CORDIC's core calculation algorithms. CORDIC is particularly well-suited for handheld calculators, in which low cost ‚Äì and thus low chip gate count ‚Äì is much more important than speed. CORDIC has been implemented in the ARM-based STM32G4, Intel 8087, 80287, 80387 up to the 80486 coprocessor series as well as in the Motorola 68881 and 68882 for some kinds of floating-point instructions, mainly as a way to reduce the gate counts (and complexity) of the FPU sub-system.  Applications  CORDIC uses simple shift-add operations for several computing tasks such as the calculation of trigonometric, hyperbolic and logarithmic functions, real and complex multiplications, division, square-root calculation, solution of linear systems, eigenvalue estimation, singular value decomposition, QR factorization and many others. As a consequence, CORDIC has been used for applications in diverse areas such as signal and image processing, communication systems, robotics and 3D graphics apart from general scientific and technical computation. = Hardware = The algorithm was used in the navigational system of the Apollo program's Lunar Roving Vehicle to compute bearing and range, or distance from the Lunar module. CORDIC was used to implement the Intel 8087 math coprocessor in 1980, avoiding the need to implement hardware multiplication. CORDIC is generally faster than other approaches when a hardware multiplier is not available (e.g., a microcontroller), or when the number of gates required to implement the functions it supports should be minimized (e.g., in an FPGA or ASIC). On the other hand, when a hardware multiplier is available (e.g., in a DSP microprocessor), table-lookup methods and power series are generally faster than CORDIC. In recent years, the CORDIC algorithm has been used extensively for various biomedical applications, especially in FPGA implementations. = Software = Many older systems with integer-only CPUs have implemented CORDIC to varying extents as part of their IEEE floating-point libraries. As most modern general-purpose CPUs have floating-point registers with common operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, sine, cosine, square root, log10, natural log, the need to implement CORDIC in them with software is nearly non-existent. Only microcontroller or special safety and time- constrained software applications would need to consider using CORDIC.  Modes of operation  = Rotation mode = CORDIC can be used to calculate a number of different functions. This explanation shows how to use CORDIC in rotation mode to calculate the sine and cosine of an angle, assuming that the desired angle is given in radians and represented in a fixed-point format. To determine the sine or cosine for an angle \\\\beta, the y or x coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to the desired angle must be found. Using CORDIC, one would start with the vector v_0: : v_0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. An illustration of the CORDIC algorithm in progress In the first iteration, this vector is rotated 45¬∞ counterclockwise to get the vector v_1. Successive iterations rotate the vector in one or the other direction by size-decreasing steps, until the desired angle has been achieved. Step i size is \\\\arctan{(2^{-i})} for i = 0, 1, 2, \\\\dots. More formally, every iteration calculates a rotation, which is performed by multiplying the vector v_{i-1} with the rotation matrix R_{i}: : v_i = R_i v_{i-1}. The rotation matrix is given by : R_i = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\gamma_i) & -\\\\sin(\\\\gamma_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\gamma_i) & \\\\cos(\\\\gamma_i) \\\\end{bmatrix}. Using the following two trigonometric identities: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\cos(\\\\gamma_i) &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\tan^2(\\\\gamma_i)}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\gamma_i) &= \\\\frac{\\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i)}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\tan^2(\\\\gamma_i)}}, \\\\end{align} the rotation matrix becomes : R_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\tan^2(\\\\gamma_i)}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i) & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The expression for the rotated vector v_i = R_i v_{i-1} then becomes : v_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\tan^2(\\\\gamma_i)}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i) & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{i-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{i-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}, where x_{i-1} and y_{i-1} are the components of v_{i-1}. Restricting the angles \\\\gamma_i such that \\\\tan(\\\\gamma_i) = \\\\pm 2^{-i}, the multiplication with the tangent can be replaced by a division by a power of two, which is efficiently done in digital computer hardware using a bit shift. The expression then becomes : v_i = K_i \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\sigma_i 2^{-i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_i 2^{-i} & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{i-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{i-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}, where : K_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + 2^{-2i}}}, and \\\\sigma_i is used to determine the direction of the rotation: if the angle \\\\gamma_i is positive, then \\\\sigma_i is +1, otherwise it is ‚àí1. K_i can be ignored in the iterative process and then applied afterward with a scaling factor : K(n) = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} K_i = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + 2^{-2i}}}, which is calculated in advance and stored in a table or as a single constant, if the number of iterations is fixed. This correction could also be made in advance, by scaling v_0 and hence saving a multiplication. Additionally, it can be noted that : K = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} K(n) \\\\approx 0.6072529350088812561694 to allow further reduction of the algorithm's complexity. Some applications may avoid correcting for K altogether, resulting in a processing gain A: : A = \\\\frac{1}{K} = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\\\sqrt{1 + 2^{-2i}} \\\\approx 1.64676025812107. After a sufficient number of iterations, the vector's angle will be close to the wanted angle \\\\beta. For most ordinary purposes, 40 iterations (n = 40) is sufficient to obtain the correct result to the 10th decimal place. The only task left is to determine whether the rotation should be clockwise or counterclockwise at each iteration (choosing the value of \\\\sigma). This is done by keeping track of how much the angle was rotated at each iteration and subtracting that from the wanted angle; then in order to get closer to the wanted angle \\\\beta, if \\\\beta_{n+1} is positive, the rotation is clockwise, otherwise it is negative and the rotation is counterclockwise: : \\\\beta_i = \\\\beta_{i-1} - \\\\sigma_i \\\\gamma_i, \\\\quad \\\\gamma_i = \\\\arctan(2^{-i}). The values of \\\\gamma_n must also be precomputed and stored. But for small angles, \\\\arctan(\\\\gamma_n) = \\\\gamma_n in fixed-point representation, reducing table size. As can be seen in the illustration above, the sine of the angle \\\\beta is the y coordinate of the final vector v_n, while the x coordinate is the cosine value. = Vectoring mode = The rotation-mode algorithm described above can rotate any vector (not only a unit vector aligned along the x axis) by an angle between ‚àí90¬∞ and +90¬∞. Decisions on the direction of the rotation depend on \\\\beta_i being positive or negative. The vectoring-mode of operation requires a slight modification of the algorithm. It starts with a vector the x coordinate of which is positive and the y coordinate is arbitrary. Successive rotations have the goal of rotating the vector to the x axis (and therefore reducing the y coordinate to zero). At each step, the value of y determines the direction of the rotation. The final value of \\\\beta_i contains the total angle of rotation. The final value of x will be the magnitude of the original vector scaled by K. So, an obvious use of the vectoring mode is the transformation from rectangular to polar coordinates.  Implementation  = Software example = The following is a MATLAB/GNU Octave implementation of CORDIC that does not rely on any transcendental functions except in the precomputation of tables. If the number of iterations n is predetermined, then the second table can be replaced by a single constant.

The choice for a multiplier-based or CORDIC-based implementation will depend on the context. The multiplication of two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary components (rectangular coordinates), for example, requires 4 multiplications, but could be realized by a single CORDIC operating on complex numbers represented by their polar coordinates, especially if the magnitude of the numbers is not relevant (multiplying a complex vector with a vector on the unit circle actually amounts to a rotation). CORDICs are often used in circuits for telecommunications such as digital down converters.  Related algorithms  CORDIC is part of the class of \\"shift-and-add\\" algorithms, as are the logarithm and exponential algorithms derived from Henry Briggs' work. Another shift-and-add algorithm which can be used for computing many elementary functions is the BKM algorithm, which is a generalization of the logarithm and exponential algorithms to the complex plane. For instance, BKM can be used to compute the sine and cosine of a real angle x (in radians) by computing the exponential of 0+ix, which is \\\\operatorname{cis}(x) = \\\\cos(x) + i \\\\sin(x). The BKM algorithm is slightly more complex than CORDIC, but has the advantage that it does not need a scaling factor (K).

In common parlance shinj≈´ is used to refer to any group suicide of persons bound by love, typically lovers, parents and children, and even whole families. In Japanese theatre and literary tradition, double suicides are the simultaneous suicides of two lovers whose ninjo, (personal feelings) or love for one another are at odds with giri, social conventions or familial obligations. Double suicides were rather common in Japan throughout history and double suicide is an important theme of the puppet theatre repertory. The tragic denouement is usually known to the audience and is preceded by a michiyuki, a small poetical journey, where lovers evoke the happier moments of their lives and their attempts at loving each other. Lovers committing double suicide believed that they would be united again in heaven, a view supported by feudal teaching in Edo period Japan, which taught that the bond between husband and wife is continued into the next world,http://www.ibsensociety.liu.edu/conferencepapers/mori.pdf Mitsuya MORI(2004) \\"Double Suicide at Rosmersholm\\" and by the teaching of Pure Land Buddhism wherein it is believed that through double suicide, one can approach rebirth in the Pure Land.http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR- PHIL/becker.htm Carl B.

Background  The island of Rhodes was a mercantile republic with a large navy which controlled the entrance to the Aegean Sea. Rhodes maintained treaties of neutrality with other empires to protect trade. However, they had a close relationship with Ptolemy I and Demetrius was worried Rhodes would supply him with ships. Demetrius also saw the possibility of Rhodes being used as a base of operations. The decision to lay siege to Rhodes was influenced by these fears but it was also effectively a piratical enterprise by Demetrius. Much of the Greek world, regardless of whether they were allies of Demetrius or not, apparently also viewed the siege as a pirate attack and sympathized with the Rhodians, and this attitude existed even in Macedonia. Along with a fighting fleet of 200 ships and 150 auxiliary vessels, Demetrius also enlisted the aid of many pirate fleets. Over 1,000 private trading vessels followed his fleets in anticipation of the plunder his successes would bring.  Siege  Rhodes The city and main harbor of Rhodes was strongly fortified and Demetrius was unable to prevent supply ships from running his blockade, so capturing the harbor was his main objective. He first built his own harbor alongside the original and constructed a mole from which he deployed a floating boom,Diodorus Siculus (1814) with G. Booth, trans., The Historical Library of Diodorus the Sicilian, ‚Ä¶ (London, England: J. Davis), vol. 2, Book XX, Ch. IV, p. 477 but Demetrius ultimately never succeeded in taking the harbor. Meanwhile, his army ravaged the island and built a huge camp next to the city, but just out of missile range. Early in the siege the walls were breached and a number of troops entered the city but they were all killed and Demetrius didn't press the attack. The walls were subsequently repaired. Both sides used many technical devices during the siege such as mines and counter-mines and various siege engines. Demetrius even built the now notable siege tower, known as the Helepolis, in his attempt to take the city.(Diodorus, 1814), Book XX, Ch. V, p. 486. The citizens of Rhodes were successful in resisting Demetrius; after one year he abandoned the siege and signed a peace agreement (304 BC) which Demetrius presented as a victory because Rhodes agreed to remain neutral in his war with Ptolemy (Egypt). The unpopularity of the siege may have been a factor in its abandonment after only one year. Several years later the Helepolis, which had been abandoned, had its metal plating melted down and - along with the money from selling the remains of the siege engines and equipment left behind by Demetrius - was used to erect a statue of their sun god, Helios, now known as the Colossus of Rhodes, to commemorate their heroic resistance.Pliny the Elder (1857) with John Bostock and H.T. Riley, trans., The Natural History of Pliny (London, England: Henry G. Bohn), vol. 6, Book 34, Ch. 18, p. 165.  Popular culture  L. Sprague de Camp used the siege and the building of the Colossus in one of his historical novels, The Bronze God of Rhodes. Alfred Duggan's novel on the life of Demetrius, Elephants and Castles, also covers the siege. The fourth novel in Christian Cameron's Tyrant series, Destroyer of Cities, features the siege of Rhodes. Emma Lazarus wrote a poem contrasting the Statue of Liberty to Colossus titled The New Colossus.

Irons in the late 1960s through early 1970s, at the National Security Agency (NSA). Unlike most other systems languages, IMP supports syntax-extensible programming. Even though , IMP excludes many defining features of that language, while supporting a very non-ALGOL-like one: syntax extensibility. A compiler for IMP existed as early as 1965 and was used to program the CDC 6600 time-sharing system, which was in use at the Institute for Defense Analyses since 1967. Although the compiler is slower than comparable ones for non- extensible languages, it has been used for practical production work. IMP compilers were developed for the CDC 6600, Cray, PDP-10 and PDP-11 computers. Important IMP versions were IMP65, IMP70, and IMP72. Extensible syntax in IMP72 Being an extensible syntax programming language, IMP allows a programmer to extend its syntax, although no specific means are provided to add new data types or structures to it. To achieve its syntax-extensibility, IMP uses a powerful parse algorithm based on a syntax graph and several connectivity matrices. The programmer may add new Backus‚ÄìNaur form (BNF) productions to the graph. IMP72's syntax is extended by means of extended-BNF syntax statements included in a source code program. The mechanism is so powerful, that it allowed the implementation of the language by itself, i.e., by an IMP72 source file consisting entirely of syntax statements, which was input to a trivial compiler which was initially able to translate the simplest case of the syntax statement. There is also a simple form of the syntax statement which looks like a macro to the casual user. Basically, the syntax statement is an augmented BNF production with associated semantics added on the right: ::= syntax-part ::= semantic-part For example, to add the construct described by the following BNF: ::= INCREMENT with the semantics that \`INCREMENT V\` should translate to \`V <- V + 1\`, the programmer would only need to insert the following IMP statement: ::= INCREMENT ::= \\"A‚ÜêA+1\\" The semantic-part can also contain calls to semantic routines, as in the following syntax statement: ::= ABS ( ) ::= DEWOP(214B,AREG1(1,13),A) The semantic part of this statement consists of a call on the semantic routine \`DEWOP\`. The arguments are the octal constant \`214B\`, the semantic routine call \`AREG1(1,13)\`, and \`A\`, which is the object on top of the stack at the moment this production is invoked. \`DEWOP\` is a semantic routine which respectively takes as its arguments a PDP-10 machine language opcode, a register object, and any other object, and produces an object whose value is the result of executing the designated machine instruction using as address field the object which is its last argument. In this example, the opcode \`214B\` designates the \`Load Magnitude\` instruction, and thus the result of the above syntax statement will be to compile code to compute the absolute value of \`A\`.

In the , Inglewood had a population of 954 people. Inglewood is the second largest town in the Goondiwindi Region. The current slogan for the town is 'Catch the country spirit'. Geography The town sits on the southern Darling Downs midway between the larger centres of Warwick and Goondiwindi on the Cunningham Highway. It is south-west of Toowoomba. It is part of the Border Rivers region of waterways. The confluence of the Macintyre Brook and Canning Creek is sited just north of Inglewood, with the brook running 270¬∞ around the town. Olive growing is a comparatively new industry in the area. Other established industries include sheep and cattle raising, grain growing and timber harvesting. Tobacco growing was common around Inglewood over the last 60 years. History Bigambul (also known as Bigambal, Bigumbil, Pikambul, Pikumbul) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bigambul people. The Bigambul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Goondiwindi Regional Council, including the towns of Goondiwindi, Yelarbon and Texas extending north towards Moonie and Millmerran. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney building, Inglewood, ca. 1925 English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham has been credited with being the first European to discover the Inglewood area. He passed through east of the present township in May 1827. The first settlement in the area was known as Browns Inn and was an important watering point for bullock teams moving west. The inn opened in the late 1850s on the south side of Macintyre Brook. In April 1862 a town was surveyed by L.F. Landsbergon on the higher northern side of Macintyre Book. Plans were drawn up for the present site and the name changed to Inglewood by Landsberg using a compound word ingol (an Aboriginal word meaning cypress pine) and the English word wood referring to a clump of trees on the northern side of the brook. Inglewood Post Office opened on 16 September 1866. Most of the hinterland consisted of station holdings which were selected as early as 1848 and were the start of the wool, cattle and wheat base of the region. Inglewood State School opened on 13 February 1872 as a primary with a secondary department opened on 25 January 1960. A hospital was built in 1921. Anglican, Catholic and Presbyterian churches opened in 1894, 1902 and 1906 respectively. Looking east along Albert Street in Inglewood, 1951 In 1907 Inglewood was connected by rail to Warwick, and westward to Goondiwindi by the South Western railway line. Nine years later Inglewood became a rail junction when the line to Texas was opened. It carried freight, including fuel to, and ore from, the Silverspur mine east of Texas. The Texas rail line was closed in 1994, due to lack of passengers and the usage of trucks to move freight. Local dairying was served by a branch factory of the Warwick Co-operative between 1940 and 1960. In 1925, Pugh's Queensland Directory recorded four hotels in Inglewood, two sawmills, a picture show and several other stores and tradespeople. On 16 February 1922, the Inglewood War Memorial was dedicated by the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the Carnarvon, Major Edward Costello, as part of at the official opening of the Inglewood Memorial Hospital. St Maria Goretti's School opened on 5 February 1951 by the Sisters of St Joseph after having been blessed by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Toowoomba, Joseph Basil Roper on 28 January 1951. The school was named in honour of St Maria Goretti, an Italian girl who had been canonised in 1950 and a popular choice of the Italian immigrant families of the district. The school had 51 students in its first year. The Inglewood Public Library building was opened in 1996 with a minor refurbishment in 2011. Inglewood town was the council seat of the former Shire of Inglewood until its amalgamation to form part of the larger Goondiwindi Region in 2008. At the Inglewood has a population of 1,069 people. Attractions thumbleft Lake Coolmunda provides water for Inglewood and irrigators as far downstream as Goondiwindi. Inglewood's main attraction is Lake Coolmunda, east of town. The lake is a popular location for water skiing, sailing, canoeing, fishing, camping and bird watching. The Inglewood & District Historical Society runs a small exhibit in the Inglewood Heritage Centre showcasing the history of exploration, settlement, education, culture, agriculture, industry and transportation in the area. Education Inglewood State School is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood-10) school for boys and girls at Chilcott Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 141 students with 17 teachers (14 full-time equivalent) and 17 non-teaching staff (10 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. St Maria Goretti School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Elizabeth Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 23 students with 5 teachers (4 full-time equivalent) and 3 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent). Because Inglewood only offers schooling up to Year 10, students often travel daily to Goondiwindi or attend boarding schools in Warwick, Toowoomba and Brisbane to complete Years 11 and 12.  Facilities Our Lady of the Southern Cross Roman Catholic Church, 2008 Inglewood has a public library open to the community, a Civic Centre which hosts local events and plays, sports grounds, tennis courts, swimming pool, golf course, and bowling club. The Goondiwindi Regional Council operates a public library in Inglewood at the Civic Centre, corner of Albert and Elizabeth Streets.

One of the Hussars' former Commanding Officers, Lieutenant-Colonel (Retd) Roman Jarymowycz, O.M.M., C.D., later became Dean and Director of the Militia Command and Staff Course, serving as an instructor for 15 years.Governor General of Canada, Press Release: \\"Governor General announces 89 new Appointments to the Order of Military Merit\\" on June 27, 2001, and Canada Gazette, Vol. 135, No 35 ‚Äî September 1, 2001 From 1986 to 1990, the regiment won the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps Buchanan Trophy (the best armour unit in the Eastern and Atlantic Areas) a total of five times and the Worthington Trophy (the best armour unit in Canada) a total of three times. In August 1990, the regiment commanded and formed the headquarters and one complete squadron for the first-of-its-kind Militia brigade-level exercise. Exercise En Guard was held at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown and included the four armoured units of Secteur de l'Est (RBSE). Shortly afterwards, in September 1990, the regiment sent a 21-man contingent to Cyprus augmenting the 12e R√©giment blind√© du Canada on its United Nations peacekeeping tour of duty. Since 1990 the regiment has deployed troops on UN missions in both Haiti and Bosnia, as well as providing personnel during the Oka crisis and the ice storm of 1998. The unit has also continued to participate in the Noble Lion exercises as part of Land Force Quebec Area. On April 1, 1997, The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal) became the establishment armoured regiment (tank) for the newly formed 34th Canadian Brigade Group (34 CBG).

It was found when an amateur archaeologist noticed flint tools eroding out of a sandy cliff face near the village of Howick. Investigations found a circle of substantial post holes with charcoal stains in their bases, a number of smaller stake holes, some angled in from outside a hollow, and inside the house a number of shallow hearths filled with charcoal, burnt nutshells and some fragments of bone. Radiocarbon dating of the charred hazelnut shells established that the building was constructed about 7600 BC and occupied for about 100 years, which led to the find being called \\"Britain's oldest house\\". This title was disputed in 2010 when the discovery of the even older 'house- structure' at Star Carr in North Yorkshire was announced. Reconstructed Mesolithic round-house Replica of a 10,000 year old round-house which was excavated from a nearby cliff-top site which had been discovered by the identification of flint artifacts in the eroding cliffs by amateur archaeologists. Some of the hearths only showed signs of nut roasting, and the numbers of shells suggested that food was cooked here in quantity, perhaps to preserve it for times of scarcity. Together with the very substantial construction shown by the size of post holes, this led to the view that the house was occupied permanently rather than being used on a transient or seasonal basis as expected during the Mesolithic period. Charred hazelnut shells have been found at several other sites from this period, including Cramond, but their smaller stake holes were interpreted as remains of a temporary encampment. The interpretation that this was a permanent residence for hunter-gatherers is supported by analysis that Howick is a place where natural resources would have allowed all year round occupation. Its coastal position provided animals, flint for tools, wood for construction and fuel, fish, seals, sea birds and their eggs, shellfish and a nearby source of fresh water that was available at the time of occupation. Many sites from this time are coastal, but the particular circumstances found here and the evidence of ceremonial ritual from the site at Star Carr in Yorkshire, not very far away, are interpreted as indicating that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers were capable of establishing permanent settlements.

The film was written by Dreyer and Christen Jul based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 collection of supernatural stories In a Glass Darkly. Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire. Vampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were recorded. Vampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has become much more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere. Plot On a late evening, Allan Gray arrives at an inn close to the village of Courtempierre and he rents a room to sleep. Gray is awakened suddenly by an old man, who enters the room and leaves a square packet on Gray's table; \\"To be opened upon my death\\" is written on the wrapping paper. Gray takes the package and walks outside. Shadows guide him to an old castle, where he sees the shadows dancing and wandering on their own. Gray also sees an elderly woman (later identified as Marguerite Chopin) and encounters another old man (later identified as the village doctor). Gray leaves the castle and walks to a manor. Looking through one of the windows, Gray sees the Lord of the manor, the same man who gave him the package earlier. The man is suddenly murdered by gunshot. Gray is let into the house by servants, who rush to the aid of the fallen man but it is too late to save him. The servants ask Gray to stay the night. Gis√®le, the younger daughter of the now deceased Lord of the manor, takes Gray to the library and tells him that her sister, L√©one, is gravely ill. Just then they see L√©one walking outside. They follow her, and find her unconscious on the ground with fresh bite wounds. They have her carried inside. Gray remembers the parcel and opens it. Inside is a book about horrific demons called Vampyrs. By reading the book, Gray learns that L√©one is a victim of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits L√©one at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood transfusion is needed and Gray offers his blood to save L√©one. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to L√©one, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gis√®le is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gis√®le but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and L√©one suddenly recovers. Gis√®le and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.Dreyer, Carl Theodor. Four Screenplays. Bloomington & London: Indiana University Press. 1970. . pp. 79‚Äì129.

The production company behind Dreyer's previous film had plans for Dreyer to make another film, but the project was dropped which led to Dreyer deciding to go outside the studio system to make his next film. Being Dreyer's first sound film, it was made under difficult circumstances as the arrival of sound put the European film industry in turmoil. In France, film studios lagged behind technologically with the first French sound films being shot on sound stages in England. Dreyer went to England to study sound film, where he got together with Danish writer Christen Jul who was living in London at the time. Dreyer decided to create a story based on the supernatural and read over thirty mystery stories and found a number of re-occurring elements including doors opening mysteriously and door handles moving with no one knowing why. Dreyer decided that \\"We can jolly well make this stuff too\\". In London and New York, the stage version of Dracula had been a large hit in 1927. Dreyer and Jul created a story based on vampires which Dreyer considered to be \\"fashionable things at the time\\". Vampyr is based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's In a Glass Darkly, a collection of five stories first published in 1872. Dreyer draws from two of the stories for Vampyr, one being Carmilla, a lesbian vampire story and the other being The Room in the Dragon Volant about a live burial. Dreyer found it difficult to decide on a title for the film. It may have initially been titled Destiny and then Shadows of Hell. When the film was presented in the film journal Close Up it was titled The Strange Adventure of David Gray. =Pre-production= Dreyer returned to France to begin casting and location scouting. At the time in France, there was a small movement of artistic independently financed films, including Luis Bu√±uel's L'√Çge d'Or and Jean Cocteau's The Blood of a Poet which were both released in 1930. Through Valentine Hugo, Dreyer met Nicolas de Gunzburg, an aristocrat who agreed to finance Dreyer's next film in return for playing the lead role in it. Gunzberg had arguments with his family about becoming an actor, so he created the pseudonym Julian West, a name that would be the same in all three languages that the film was going to be shot in. censors requested that the scene be toned down. Most of the cast in Vampyr were not professional actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris. When approached to act in the film, Hieronimko stared blankly and did not reply. Hieronimko later contacted Dreyer's crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and caf√©s. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter L√©one. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Mat√© and art director Hermann Warm. The entire film was shot on location with many scenes shot in Courtempierre, France. Dreyer and his cinematographer Rudolph Mat√© contributed to the location scouting for Vampyr. Dreyer left most of his scouting to an assistant, who Dreyer instructed to find \\"a factory in ruins, a chopped up phantom, worthy of the imagination of Edgar Allan Poe. Somewhere in Paris. We can't travel far.\\" In the original script, the village doctor was intended to flee the village and get trapped in a swamp. On looking for a suitable mire, the crew found a mill where they saw white shadows around the windows and doors. After seeing this place, they changed the film's ending to take place at this mill where the doctor dies by suffocating under the milled flour. =Filming= Vampyr was filmed between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer believed it would be beneficial by lending the dream- like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices that were going to be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm. Critic and writer Kim Newman described Vampyrs style as closer to the experimental features such as Un Chien Andalou (1929) than a \\"quickie horror film\\" made after the release of Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a \\"heavy style\\" but changed direction after cinematographer Mat√© showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred.Clarens, 1997. p. 107 This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Mat√© shoot the film through a piece of gauze held three feet (.9 m) away from the camera to re- create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gis√®le, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he \\"had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. And do you think this intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground\\". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931. =Post-production= Allan Gray (Nicolas de Gunzburg) finds a coffin containing himself in a dream sequence. Modern critics praise this sequence as one of the most memorable sequences from Vampyr. Dreyer shot and edited the film in France and then brought it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound equipment available to him at the time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were created by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music. There are differences between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes which had to be toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were included in the script and shot that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gis√®le by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore. Dreyer had prepared a Danish version of the film which was based on the German version with Danish subtitles and title cards. The distributor could not afford to have the title cards completed in the manner they appear in the German version, which were instead finished with a more simple style. The distributor also wanted to make the pages in the book shown in the film as plain title cards which Dreyer did not allow, saying that \\"the old book is not an text in the ordinary sense, but an actor. Just as much as the others.\\" Release The premiere of Vampyr in Germany was delayed by UFA, as the studio wanted the American films Dracula and Frankenstein to be released first. The Berlin premiere was on 6 May 1932. At this premiere, the audience booed the film which led to Dreyer cutting several scenes out of the film after the first showing. The film was distributed in France by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Cinema who also distributed Dreyer's previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. The Paris premiere was in September 1932 where Vampyr was the opening attraction of a new cinema on the Boulevard Raspail. At a showing of the film in Vienna, audiences demanded their money back. When this was denied, a riot broke out that led to police having to restore order with night sticks. When the film premiered in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1933, Dreyer did not attend. In the USA, the film premiered with English subtitles under the title Not Against The Flesh; an English-dubbed version, edited severely as to both the film continuity and the music track, appeared a few years later on the roadshow circuit as Castle of Doom. Dreyer soon had a nervous breakdown and went to a mental hospital in France. The film was a financial failure.Truffaut 1994, p. 48. =Critical reception= Press in Europe ranged from mixed to negative. The press in Germany did not like the film. At the Berlin premiere, a film critic from The New York Times wrote: \\"Whatever you think of the director Charles [sic] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different'. He does things that make people talk about him. You may find his films ridiculous‚Äîbut you won't forget them...Although in many ways [Vampyr] was one of the worst films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness\\". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was \\"a hallucinating film\\", that \\"either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter\\". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works. More modern reception for Vampyr has been more positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 100% based upon a sample of 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.83/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing.\\" Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film four and a half stars out of five, stating that \\"Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, even if you are a fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images\\" and that although the film is \\"not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice if you want to see a film that establishes a compelling mood\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, \\"The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [Vampyr] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has something to do with Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form\\". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that \\"Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film‚Äîmaybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director\\". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is \\"lesser known (but in many ways superior)\\" and that the film is \\"a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare\\". In the early 2010s, the London edition of Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Vampyr placed at number 50 on their top 100 list. =Home media= Vampyr has been released with imperfect image and sound as the original German and French sound and film negatives are lost. Prints of the French and German versions of the film exist but most of them are either incomplete or damaged. Vampyr was released in the United States under the titles of The Vampire, and Castle of Doom and in the United Kingdom under the title of The Strange Adventures of David Gray.McNally, 1994. p. 259 Many of these prints are severely cut, such as the re-dubbed 60-minute English-language Castle of Doom print. Vampyr was originally released on DVD on 13 May 1998 by Image Entertainment which ran at an abridged 72-minute running time. Image's release of Vampyr is a straight port of the Laserdisc that film restorer David Shepard produced in 1991. The subtitles are large and ingrained due to the source print having Danish subtitles which have been blacked out and covered. This DVD also included the short film The Mascot as a bonus feature. The Criterion Collection released a two-disc edition of Vampyr on 22 July 2008. This edition of the DVD includes the original German version of the film, along with a book featuring Dreyer and Christen Jul's original screenplay and Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 story \\"Carmilla\\". A Region 2 DVD of the film was released by Eureka Films on 25 August 2008. The Eureka release contains the same bonus material as the Criterion Collection discs, but also includes a commentary from director Guillermo del Toro. In October 2017, Criterion released the film on Blu-ray. This version was made from a new HD digital transfer of the 1998 restoration.

She was the secret biological daughter of actor Clark Gable and actress Loretta Young. Early life Lewis was born on November 6, 1935 in Venice, California. She was conceived while her birth parents, Loretta Young and Clark Gable, were working on the film The Call of the Wild. Gable was married at the time of Lewis's conception, and Young concealed her pregnancy to avoid scandal. Weeks after her birth, Lewis was placed in an orphanage. Lewis would spend the next 19 months in various \\"hideaways and orphanages\\" before being reunited with her mother. Young then claimed that she had adopted Lewis. When Lewis was four years old, Young married radio producer Tom Lewis, and Judy took his last name. Young and Lewis went on to have two sons, Christopher Lewis and Peter Lewis. Lewis bore a striking resemblance to Gable, including having ears that stuck out. When Lewis was seven years old, Young had her undergo a painful operation to pin her ears back in another attempt to hide her real parentage. When Lewis was fifteen, Gable came to her mother's house to visit her briefly. Gable asked Lewis about her life and then, upon leaving, kissed her on her forehead. It was the only time that Lewis ever spoke to Gable, and at the time, she had no idea that he was her father. As an adult, Lewis spoke of the confusion, isolation and alienation she felt within her own family while growing up. Career Lewis' acting credits include appearances on TV serials such as General Hospital, Kitty Foyle, The Brighter Day and The Doctors. Ms. Lewis had her longest running serial role on The Secret Storm as Susan Ames from 1964‚Äì1971. She also produced the short-lived Another World spin-off, Texas and was a script writer for NBC Daytime's Search for Tomorrow. In 1958, Lewis guest-starred in \\"Attack\\", an episode of the syndicated western series Mackenzie's Raiders. She guest-starred with Grant Sullivan in his syndicated western series, Pony Express. In 1960, Lewis portrayed a girlfriend of a United States Navy officer in the episode \\"Tiger Blood\\" of the syndicated series The Blue Angels. In the 1961‚Äì1962 television season, she appeared as Connie Masters, an employee of the Wells Fargo office in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in the NBC western series, The Outlaws. In 1975, she guest-starred in the short-lived CBS family drama Three for the Road. In 1985, Lewis shared a Writers Guild of America award for several episodes of CBS's Search For Tomorrow. Lewis obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in clinical psychology from Antioch University in Los Angeles, became a licensed family and child counselor in 1992, and was a practicing psychotherapist with a specialty in foster care and marriage therapy. Personal life and death Lewis was the niece of actresses Polly Ann Young, Sally Blane, and Georgiana Young. She was also the paternal half-sister of John Clark Gable (Clark Gable's son with his fifth wife, Kay Williams) and the maternal half-sister of Christopher Lewis and Peter Lewis (Loretta's biological sons). Musician David Lindley is her maternal cousin.David Lindley's father, Jack Lindley, was Loretta Young's brother. See Interview with Peter Lewis by Jud Cost, 1995; www.sundazed.com. Lewis married Joseph Tinney in 1958, having one child together, daughter Maria. They divorced in 1972. After Lewis became engaged to Tinney at age twenty-three, he told her it was common knowledge that Gable was her biological father; Lewis was stunned. After Gable's death, Lewis, at age 31, finally confronted her mother about the mystery behind her parentage. Her mother said \\"YES you are my sin.\\" Young became nauseated, but acknowledged that she and Gable were Lewis's biological parents. In 1994, Lewis published a book about her life entitled Uncommon Knowledge in which she stated that Gable was her father; Young refused to speak with her for three years after the book was published. Loretta Young died on August 12, 2000, at age 87; her autobiography, published posthumously, confirmed that Gable was indeed Lewis's father. Lewis died of cancer at age 76 on November 25, 2011, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania and is interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia. In 2015, Linda Lewis, wife of Loretta Young's son Christopher, stated publicly that Young had suddenly realized at age 85 that Judy had been conceived in an act of date rape: > \\"Young loved to watch Larry King Live, which is most likely what prompted > her to first ask her friend, frequent houseguest, and would-be biographer, > Edward Funk, and then her daughter-in-law, Linda Lewis, to explain the term > ‚Äúdate rape.‚Äù As Lewis recalled from her Jensen Beach, Florida, home this > April, sitting next to her husband, Chris ‚Äî Young's second born ‚Äî and > flanked by Young's Oscar and Golden Globe, it took a tact to explain, in > language that an 85-year-old could understand, what ‚Äúdate rape‚Äù meant. ‚ÄúI > did the best I could to make her understand,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúYou have to > remember, this was a very proper lady.‚Äù > > \\"When Lewis was finished describing the act, Young's response was a > revelation: ‚ÄúThat's what happened between me and Clark.‚Äù\\" Young had never before understood the particulars of that 1935 incident and had not discussed this information before 1998, originally wanting to keep the pregnancy secret from Twentieth Century Pictures, knowing they would try to pressure her to have an abortion; Young, a devout Catholic, considered abortion to be a mortal sin. The family remained silent about the claim until Young (died 2000) and Lewis (died 2011) were both deceased.

In the general election held on 27 December 2002, the party was a partner in the National Rainbow Coalition, which won 56.1% of the popular vote and 125 out of 212 elected seats. The party itself took 59 of these seats. In the presidential election held on the same day, the party supported Mwai Kibaki, who won 62.2% of the vote and was elected. Before 2002 the party had been an insignifanct splinter group which was joined by a large number of former KANU members after the nomination of Uhuru Kenyatta to be KANU's presidential candidate. Members of the former National Democratic Party NDP of Raila Odinga which had joined KANU only in summer 2001 left the then ruling party together with KANU politicians who were opposed to what they perceived as imposition of Kenyatta as candidate by the then president Moi. After leaving KANU, they did not take the risk of attempting to register a new party under a government controlled by Moi but instead opted to join the existing LDP which offered them a space. LDP then teamed up with the National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK) of Mwai Kibaki to form NARC which won the 2003 election with Kibaki as its presidential candidate. Tensions developed soon as Kibaki did not honour a memorandum of understand√≠ng signed between the partners in NARC and which envisaged a share of 50% of cabinet posts for LDP plus a new constitution which would curtail the power of the president and create the post of a prime minister which was to go to Odinga. After the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2005 LPD left the NARC-government. Instead, LDP and KANU formed a coalition known as Orange Democratic Movement, later registered as a political party, ODM-Kenya. KANU later left the coalition only to join Party of National Unity, a new coalition led by President Mwai Kibaki. Consequently, some KANU politicians including William Ruto and Musalia Mudavadi left KANU to stay with ODM-Kenya. ODM-Kenya, on the other hand, split into two parties, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and ODM-Kenya. The former is led by Raila Odinga and the latter by Kalonzo Musyoka. Thus LDP did not participate the 2007 general elections as most of its members had either joined ODM, while some joined ODM- Kenya. Following the enforcing of the Political Parties act in December 2008, LDP ceased to be a registered political party. LDP was an observer party at the Liberal International.

Body Psychotherapy: An Introduction. Berkshire, England: Open University Press, McGraw-Hill House. (p.107-108) Arnold Mindell at Worldwork Denver 2011 Life Arnold Mindell was born in Schenectady, New York. He studied applied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then at the ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Mindell was introduced to Jungian psychology in Switzerland following a chance encounter with Franz Riklin, then president of the C.G. Jung Institute. Mindell subsequently entered analysis with Riklin and Marie-Louise von Franz and trained as a Jungian analyst at the Jung Institute. He has a Ph.D. in psychology from the Union Institute. Mindell received the Jungian analyst diploma in 1970 and worked at the C. G. Jung Institute as a teacher and training analyst until he left in 1985. In the early 1980s, Mindell and colleagues began the first training program for process oriented psychology, in Z√ºrich; and in 1982 founded what is now known as the Institute for Process Work (Institut f√ºr Prozessarbeit IPA), an accredited training institute for psychotherapy in Switzerland. In the late 1980s Mindell and his wife, Amy Mindell, moved back to the United States from Switzerland, causing some controversy in the small coastal town of Yachats, Oregon, with plans to build a seminar venue. In 1990, Mindell and colleagues established a center for teaching process oriented psychology in Portland, Oregon, now known as the Process Work Institute, which in 2001 was the subject of a controversial ethics complaint. The Mindells settled in Oregon, and in 2013 were invited by the Yachats Academy of Arts and Sciences to present a lecture on their conflict resolution and open forum work around the world. Mindell features prominently in Micah Toub's 2010 memoir Growing Up Jung.Toub, M. (2010). Growing Up Jung: Coming of Age as the Son of Two Shrinks. New York: W.W. Norton & Company. See Ch 1 The Marginalized & Ch 2 Dreambody (pp. 15-68) Toub represents Mindell as a charismatic, unconventional post-Jungian teacher and psychotherapist who was a ‚Äúa guru-like figure‚Äù for Toub's parents. Work =Overview= Mindell founded and developed process oriented psychology, also known as Process Work. Core ideas include his ‚Äòdreambody‚Äô concept and the application of psychology to social issues and conflict resolution in large groups, known as ‚Äòworldwork‚Äô and the principle of ‚Äòdeep democracy.‚Äô Mindell's first book, Dreambody: The Body's Role in Revealing the Self (1982), linked ‚Äòthe mind‚Äôs dreaming process with illness and physical symptoms as well as with disciplines such as yoga and tai chi.‚Äô Mindell is known for suggesting that ‚Äòsymptoms are dreams trying to come true.‚Äô Stanislav Grof has described Arnold Mindell as one of the ‚Äòpioneers of transpersonal psychology.‚ÄôGrof, S. (2010). The Consciousness Revolution. In V. V. Kozlov, V. V. Maykov, & V. F. Petrenko (Eds.), Consciousness Revolution: Transpersonal Discoveries That Are Changing the World. Materials of the 17th International Transpersonal Conference. Moscow, July 23‚Äì27, 2010. (pp. 100‚Äì103). Moscow: Presidium of the International Academy of Psychological Sciences. Retrieved from http://ita2010.com/downloads/en/eng_17th_Conference_Theses.pdf (p.102) In 2012, Mindell was one of five people recognized with a Pioneer Award from the US Association of Body Psychotherapy. He is a holder of the World Certificate for Psychotherapy (WCPC) awarded by the World Council for Psychotherapy. In the 2017 critical exploration of the relationship between African Americans and C.G. Jung's analytical psychology, Fanny Brewster describes Mindell's dreambody work and his linking of body symptoms and psychological development. Brewster finds that Mindell's development of Jungian ideas are aligned with traditional African concepts of healing which link mind and body: : ‚ÄòI believe that Mindell‚Äôs approach to dreamwork with its emphasis on body healing mirrors the African system of healing‚Äôs inclusiveness of body and mind in the process.‚Äô Mindell has been described as ‚Äòa natural interculturalist who excels at building relationships across cultural boundaries.‚Äô Mindell's intercultural skills include a focus on the importance of nonverbal elements of communication and the ‚Äòability to switch viewpoints and join the other‚Äôs reality.‚Äô Mindell has been the subject of two Thinking Allowed programs, the independent television series hosted by Jeffrey Mishlove. He has been interviewed on Shrink Rap Radio (2008), New Dimensions Radio (2009, 1995) and Somatic Perspectives on Psychotherapy (2009). Mindell has been criticised for teaching New Age concepts and practices that are unclear and unknown within the mainstream of psychology; and it is noted that he is not licensed as a clinical psychologist in Oregon. Mindell's dreambody work has been criticized as a form of 'metaphysical healthcare'; while another commentator referred to process oriented psychology as an example of a transpersonal psychology with the potential, he claimed, to be misused as a form of 'mind control.' =Key ideas= The ‚Äòdreambody‚Äô concept was developed in the 1970s while Mindell was a practicing Jungian analyst, derived from his observation of connections between people's dreams and their body symptoms and published in Dreambody: the Body's Role in Revealing the Self (Routledge, 1982). Mindell's therapeutic technique has been compared to Fritz Perls: ‚ÄúThe most striking difference, at least from Perls himself, is one of mood ‚Äì Mindell's work is playful, supportive and permissive rather than confrontational.‚Äù Another commentator writes: ‚ÄúMindell ‚Ä¶ exemplifies both the good and bad of contemporary dreamwork. On the first score: there is a bit of flim-flam about Mindell. And he conspicuously overemploys the first person singular while extolling non-ego functions. Also, he interprets disease processes so positively that they begin to lose their catagogic authenticity. But on the second score: he is inventive, creative, intuitive, holistic, and affirmative. He breaks down prevailing categories and finds authentic meanings where our culture traditionally does not. And he helps people.‚Äù In 1995 Mindell extended the dreambody concept to a theory and practice of working with people in coma and near death states; this work inspired a UK theatre production by Improbable theatre.Gardner, L. (May 4, 1999). Arts: Beautiful dreamers: It‚Äôs hard to imagine a less promising subject for a play than a coma. But if anyone can make it work, it's Improbable Theatre. The Guardian, p. News: p13. LondonTaylor, P. (May 24, 1999). Theatre: In Death‚Äôs other kingdom. The Independent. London. In his 1988 book, City Shadows: Psychological Interventions in Psychiatry, Mindell presented his approach to psychiatric disorders, drug addiction and mental retardation. The book provides verbatim case studies describing interventions focused on the meaning of the patient's unusual communication, including non-verbal signals. Mindell's 1990 book, Working on Yourself Alone: Inner Dreambody Work, presents a meditation practice that focuses attention on subtle body experiences and amplifies them to reveal unexpected information and meaning for the meditator. It provides a model for creative spiritual practice involving inner reflection and personal development. In the 2002 work, Dreaming while Awake: Techniques for 24-hour Lucid Dreaming, Mindell built on ideas of lucid dreaming, indigenous traditions and Zen Buddhism to create an awareness practice for daily life: paying attention to thoughts and perceptions that are normally dismissed, which he calls ‚Äòflirts‚Äô from the ‚ÄòDreaming.‚Äô Mindell has also published books dealing with large group conflict resolution and leadership, notably The Leader as Martial Artist: An Introduction to Deep Democracy (1992) and Sitting in the fire: Large Group Transformation Using Conflict and Diversity (1995).Haw, P. (July 28, 2008). Appreciate and honour greybeards‚Äô wisdom. Business Day (Johannesburg). Mindell advances a concept and principle he calls ‚Äòdeep democracy' and the approach has been compared to the work of Danaan Parry.Totton, N. (2000). Psychotherapy and Politics. London: Sage Publications. (p.45-48)Britt, S. (July 2, 2012). My View: Conflict resolution starts at home. Gloucester Daily Times (MA), p. Opinion. Mindell's group conflict work has been reported within a business setting and within large community forums working with racism and other social tensions.Peay, P. (July 5, 1997). Public therapy aims to heal rifts of racism. St Petersburg Times, FL.Lattin, D. (May 1, 1992). Mediators target hot spots. San Francisco Chronicle. Mindell's concept of 'rank,' published in his book Sitting in the Fire, has been used to support greater gender awareness in mediation training. Mindell's work is known for proposing analogies between the concepts of mathematics, classical and quantum physics and psychological experiences; his books include simple exercises to guide the reader to explore their own experience of these ideas.

The East and Middle prongs are less notable divisions of the river, with the East Prong paralleled for most of its length by State Route 416, and the Middle Prong emerging from the Greenbrier area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

This is done in much the same way that a physical standard might be described as a set of procedures for creating a realization of that standard. The ITRS defines a geocentric system of coordinates using the SI system of measurement. An International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) is a realization of the ITRS. Its origin is at the center of mass of the whole earth including the oceans and atmosphere. New ITRF solutions are produced every few years, using the latest mathematical and surveying techniques to attempt to realize the ITRS as precisely as possible. Due to experimental error, any given ITRF will differ very slightly from any other realization of the ITRF. The difference between the latest WGS 84 and the latest ITRF (as of 2006) is only a few centimeters. Practical navigation systems are in general referenced to a specific ITRF solution, or to their own coordinate systems which are then referenced to an ITRF solution. The ITRS and ITRF solutions are maintained by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. and mapepire balsain ‚Äî is a highly venomous pit viper species found in the tropical lowlands of northern South America east of the Andes. No subspecies are currently recognized. Taxonomy The common lancehead was one of the many reptile and amphibian species described by Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Coluber atrox. Common names include lancehead, fer-de-lance, barba amarilla, and mapepire balsain, among others. The Spanish common name barba amarilla (yellow beard), an allusion to the pale yellow chin color, is also used in English. In Colombia, it is known as mapan√° (Llanos of Vichada) and talla equis. In Guyana and Suriname, it is called labaria or labarria. Includes a photograph. In Peru, it is called aroani (Yagua), cascabel (juveniles), ihd√≥ni (Bora), jerg√≥n, jergona, jerg√≥n de la selva, mac√°nchi (Alto Mara√±√≥n), machac√∫, marashar and nashipkit (Aguaruna names). In Venezuela, it is called mapanare. The jerg√≥n name is an allusion to the x-like markings of the color pattern. In Ecuador and Panama, these x-like markings have led to the snake simply being referred to as equis (the Spanish name of the letter 'x'). In Trinidad it is known as mapepire balsain.Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad & Tobago Dictionary, p. 75. John Mendes. (1986) Arima, Trinidad. In Bolivia it is called Yoperojobobo. In Brazil the common names are Jararaca or Jararaca-do-norte. The taxonomy of this species is controversial; it may include B. leucurus and B. moojeni, and some of its populations are sometimes said to be separate species. B. asper was formerly included in this species, but most authorities now consider it distinct. Description A terrestrial species, adults usually grow to a total length 75‚Äì125 cm (about 30-50 inches) and are moderately heavy-bodied. Reports of the maximum size are not clear, as this species is often confused with B. asper. Soini (1974) mentioned of a series of 80 specimens collected in northeastern Peru, the largest was a female of . The largest specimen measured by Campbell and Lamar (2004) was a female with a total length of . The scalation includes 23-29 (usually 23-25) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 169-214 and 177-214 ventral scales in males and females, respectively, 52-86 (usually 75 or fewer) subcaudal scales in males, which are usually divided, and 47-72 subcaudals in females. On the head, the rostral scale is about as high, or slightly higher, than it is wide. There are three to 11 (usually five to 9) keeled intersupraocular scales, seven to 13 (usually eight to 11) sublabial scales and six to 9 (usually seven) supralabial scales, the second of which is fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial. Bothrops atrox in Arima, Trinidad and Tobago. The color pattern is highly variable, including a ground color that may be olive, brown, tan, gray, yellow, or (rarely) rusty. The body markings are highly variable, as is the degree of contrast: in some specimens the pattern is very well defined, while in others it may be virtually absent. In general, however, the body pattern consists of a series of dorsolateral blotches, rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, which extend from the first scale row to the middle of the back. These blotches may oppose or alternate across the midline, often fusing to form bands. They also have pale borders, which in some cases may be prominent, and may be invaded from below by tan or gray pigment, occasionally dividing them into pairs of ventrolateral spots. The belly may be white, cream or yellowish gray, with an increasing amount of gray to black mottling posteriorly that may fade again under the tail. The head usually does not have any markings other than a moderately wide postocular stripe that runs from behind the eye back to the angle of the mouth. The iris is gold or bronze, with varying amounts of black reticulation, while the tongue is black. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the tropical lowlands of South America east of the Andes, including southeastern Colombia, southern and eastern Venezuela, the island of Trinidad (although there is some confusion regarding the systematics of this population), Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, Panama, northern Bolivia and the northern half of Brazil. The type locality is listed as \\"Asia\\", which is obviously a mistake. Schmidt and Walker (1943:295) proposed this be corrected to \\"Surinam\\". Despite the vast destruction of rain forests, it is among the most numerous and common of pit vipers and is not endangered. In Trinidad, it prefers wet forests from sea level to 940 m.Herklots GAC. 1961. The Birds of Trinidad and Tobago. Collins, London, p. 10. Behavior Although generally terrestrial, it is also an excellent swimmer and even climbs trees when necessary to reach prey. Generally nocturnal, it may forage at any time of the day, though, if necessary. These snakes are also easily agitated. Feeding The main diet includes mostly small mammals and birds, but also frogs, lizards and tarantulas. Larger prey is struck and released, after which it is tracked down via its scent trail. Reproduction Bothrops atrox can give live birth to up to 80 offspring at once. Adults breed year-round. After mating, females with developing embryos travel in and out of sunlight to keep themselves and the embryos at a constant temperature. In equatorial regions, the gestation period is about three to four months, with an average of 60 young per litter. At birth, the young are about in total length, more brightly colored than adults, and have yellow or beige tails. Venom These snakes are known to search for rodents in coffee and banana plantations. Workers there are often bitten by the snakes, which can lie camouflaged for hours, nearly undetectable, and strike with high speed. Their venom is hemorrhagic, damaging the vascular endothelium and consuming coagulation factors in a mechanism known as ‚Äúvenom-induced consumption coagulopathy‚Äù.Larreche S, Mion G, Goyffon M. [Haemostasis disorders caused by snake venoms]. Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 2008;27(4):302‚Äì309. Apr As a result, clotting assays such as prothrombin time and aPTT will be highly disturbed. Spontaneous recovery from coagulopathy is seen 14 to 30 hours after bite according to a study performed in French Guiana. A Mexican polyvalent antivenom was tested but had no effect on itHeckmann X, Lambert V, Mion G, Ehrhardt A, Marty C, Perotti F, et al.

In a case reported in the Brazilian Amazon, symptoms such as pain and ecchymoses, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension and blood incoagulability were reported, the patient died of stroke, even after administration of the antivenom. Venom yield averages , although it may be as much as . The enzyme reptilase (batroxobin), derived from this snake's venom, is used in modern medical laboratories to measure fibrinogen levels and blood coagulation capability. The test is considered to be a replacement for thrombin time, and is used when heparin is present in the sample. The enzyme is unaffected by heparin.

Equivalently, it is a superalgebra where the supercommutator :[x,y] = xy - (-1)^{x y}yx always vanishes. Algebraic structures which supercommute in the above sense are sometimes referred to as skew-commutative associative algebras to emphasize the anti-commutation, or, to emphasize the grading, graded-commutative or, if the supercommutativity is understood, simply commutative. Any commutative algebra is a supercommutative algebra if given the trivial gradation (i.e. all elements are even). Grassmann algebras (also known as exterior algebras) are the most common examples of nontrivial supercommutative algebras. The supercenter of any superalgebra is the set of elements that supercommute with all elements, and is a supercommutative algebra. The even subalgebra of a supercommutative algebra is always a commutative algebra. That is, even elements always commute. Odd elements, on the other hand, always anticommute. That is, :xy + yx = 0\\\\, for odd x and y. In particular, the square of any odd element x vanishes whenever 2 is invertible: :x^2 = 0 . Thus a commutative superalgebra (with 2 invertible and nonzero degree one component) always contains nilpotent elements. A Z-graded anticommutative algebra with the property that for every element x of odd grade (irrespective of whether 2 is invertible) is called an alternating algebra.

The term film noir was popularized in 1955 by French critics Raymond Borde and √âtienne Chaumeton. It was applied to crime films of the 1940s and 1950s, mostly produced in the United States, which adopted a 1920s/1930s Art Deco visual environment. The English translation is dark movie, indicating something sinister and shadowy, but also expressing a cinematographic style. The film noir genre includes stylish Hollywood crime dramas, often with a twisted dark wit. Neo-noir has a similar style but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements and media. Neo-noir film directors refer to 'classic noir' in the use of Dutch angles, interplay of light and shadows, unbalanced framing; blurring of the lines between good and bad and right and wrong, and thematic motifs including revenge, paranoia, and alienation. Definition Neo-noir is a contraction of the phrase 'new film noir', using the Greek prefix for the word new rendered as neo (from the Greek neo). Noir is a French word that, when used in isolation in discussing film, is a shortcut for 'film noir'. As a neologism, neo-noir is defined by Mark Conard as \\"any film coming after the classic noir period that contains noir themes and noir sensibility\\".Mark Conard. The Philosophy of Neo-noir. The Univ of Kentucky Press, 2007, p2. Another definition describes it as later noir that often synthesizes diverse genres while foregrounding the scaffolding of film noir. History \\"Film noir\\" was coined by critic Nino Frank in 1946, and popularized by French critics Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955. The term revived in general use beginning in the 1980s, with a revival of the style. The classic film noir era is usually dated from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. The films were often adaptations of American crime novels, which were also described as \\"hardboiled\\". Some authors resisted these terms. For example, James M. Cain, author of The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934) and Double Indemnity (1944), is considered to be one of the defining authors of hard-boiled fiction. Both novels were adapted as crime films, the former more than once. Cain is quoted as saying, \\"I belong to no school, hard-boiled or otherwise, and I believe these so-called schools exist mainly in the imagination of critics, and have little correspondence in reality anywhere else.\\" Typically American crime dramas or psychological thrillers, films noir had common themes and plot devices, and many distinctive visual elements. Characters were often conflicted antiheroes, trapped in a difficult situation and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems. Visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, and unusual camera placement. Sound effects helped create the noir mood of paranoia and nostalgia. Few major films in the classic film noir genre have been made since the early 1960s. These films usually incorporated both thematic and visual elements reminiscent of film noir. Both classic and neo-noir films are often produced as independent features. After 1970 film critics took note of \\"neo-noir\\" films as a separate genre. Noir and post-noir terminology (such as \\"hard-boiled\\", \\"neo- classic\\" and the like) are often rejected by both critics and practitioners. Robert Arnett stated, \\"Neo-noir has become so amorphous as a genre/movement, any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies.\\" Screenwriter and director Larry Gross, identifies Alphaville, alongside John Boorman‚Äôs Point Blank (1967) and Robert Altman‚Äôs The Long Goodbye (1973), based on Raymond Chandler's 1953 novel, as neo-noir films. Gross believes that they deviate from classic noir in having more of a sociological than a psychological focus. Neo noir features characters who commit violent crimes, but without the motivations and narrative patterns found in film noir. Neo noir assumed global character and impact when filmmakers began drawing elements from films in the global market. For instance, Quentin Tarantino's works have been influenced by Ringo Lam's City on Fire. This was particularly the case for the noir- inflected Reservoir Dogs, which was instrumental in establishing Tarantino in October 1992. See also * List of neo-noir titles * List of film noir titles * Tech noir Notes 1. In the French from which the term derives, the plural is films noir. Standard English usage is \\"films noir\\", as in \\"courts martial\\", \\"attorneys general\\" and so on, but \\"film noirs\\" is listed in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary in first order of preference.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks. WRBU's offices are located on Richardson Road in Arnold, Missouri, and its transmitter is located near Missouri Route 21 and East Four Ridge Road in House Springs. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 7 and AT&T; U-verse channel 46. History =Early history= The station first signed on the air on September 11, 1989 as WHSL, originally operating as a full simulcast of the Home Shopping Network (HSN). Unlike most full-time HSN affiliates of the period, it was not founded by the network's broadcasting arm, Silver King Communications; instead, it was originally owned by St. Louis-based Roberts Broadcasting, a family-owned firm owned by African American businessmen Steven and Michael Roberts. WHSL was the first television station to sign on in the St. Louis market since KNLC (channel 24) debuted in September 1982. In June 2001, Roberts announced that it had signed an agreement to become an affiliate of UPN, a move that would give the network its first primary affiliate in St. Louis and end the market's status as the largest U.S. city by market size that did not have a full-time affiliate of the network. Despite the fact that St. Louis was large enough to support exclusive affiliations with all six major broadcast networks that were in operation after January 1995, WHSL's operation as an HSN affiliate created a stopgap from allowing UPN to air its entire programming schedule in pattern on an exclusive basis. This forced UPN to maintain part-time affiliations with other stations for the first six years of the network's existence. Its programming was originally broadcast in late night time slots on ABC affiliate KDNL-TV (channel 30) from August 1995 until September 1998; KNLC (channel 24)‚Äîan independent station with a mix of religious and family-oriented entertainment programs‚Äîtook over the affiliation in September 1998, only to drop its affiliation after one year due to concerns over program preemptions dictated by the conservative content guidelines outlined for that station by its New Life Christian Church ownership. WB affiliate KPLR-TV (channel 11) took on a part-time affiliation with UPN‚Äîalthough delaying its prime time shows until after the station's 9:00 p.m. newscast‚Äîin September 1999. In July 2002, KPLR decided to disaffiliate from UPN and exclusively align with The WB, a move which would have affected fans of two of the network's most popular series of the period, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Star Trek: Enterprise, forcing them to watch both shows either through UPN-affiliated superstations offered by Dish Network or by way of tape trading. Roberts management sought to remedy this by obtaining permission from HSN to allow WHSL to preempt two hours a week of programming during prime time to carry both shows starting in September 2002. On January 17, 2003, the station changed its call sign to WRBU (a partial reference to its corporate parent). The remainder of the UPN programming lineup‚Äîincluding the Disney's One Too children's block, which would be discontinued by the network that August‚Äîmoved to channel 46 three months later on April 1. On that date, WRBU replaced the HSN programming with a lineup of syndicated programs to fill out the schedule, consisting of a mix of sitcoms, drama series and first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows. As a result of taking a full-time UPN affiliation, WRBU became the only conventional major network affiliate in St. Louis to be licensed to a Metro East community in the Illinois suburbs. In February 2003, Roberts Broadcasting sold a 50% interest in WRBU to the TeleFutura subsidiary of Univision Communications, under the joint venture licensee St. Louis/Denver LLC; under the terms of the deal, Roberts continued to operate the station through a time brokerage agreement and was given right of first refusal on appointees for the directors of WRBU's licensee. Through its involvement in the venture, Roberts in turn transferred operational responsibilities for its station in Denver, KTVJ (now KTFD-TV), to Univision, which converted that station into a TeleFutura affiliate. Roberts Broadcasting would eventually acquire other television stations in the Midwestern and Southeastern U.S., signing on two UPN-affiliated stations (WRBJ-TV in Jackson, Mississippi in 2005 and WZRB in Columbia, South Carolina in 2006) and acquiring WB affiliate WAZE-TV in Evansville, Indiana from South Central Communications in 2006. =As a MyNetworkTV affiliate= On January 24, 2006, the respective parent companies of UPN and The WB, CBS Corporation and the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner, announced that they would dissolve the two networks to create The CW Television Network, a joint venture between the two media companies that initially featured programs from its two predecessor networks as well as new series specifically produced for The CW. On that date, The CW also signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, under which sixteen of the group's eighteen WB-affiliated stations would serve as the network's charter stations. One of the stations included in the agreement was KPLR-TV, which was announced as the network's St. Louis affiliate over WRBU; although since the network chose its affiliates based on which television station among The WB and UPN's respective affiliate bodies was the highest-rated in each market, it is likely that KPLR would have been chosen over WRBU in any event, as channel 11 had been the higher-rated of the two stations even before it became a network affiliate upon joining The WB in January 1995 and had been one of The WB's strongest affiliates for the near entirety of that network's eleven-year existence. Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of MyNetworkTV, a network operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television that was created to primarily to provide network programming to UPN and WB stations with which The CW decided against affiliating based on their local viewership standing in comparison to the outlet that the network ultimately chose, allowing these stations another option besides converting to independent stations. On March 9, in a joint announcement by the network and Roberts Broadcasting, WRBU was confirmed as the charter MyNetworkTV affiliate for St. Louis. Channel 46 became a MyNetworkTV affiliate when that network launched on September 5, and concurrently rebranded as \\"My 46\\"; like other UPN-affiliated stations that were committed to join MyNetworkTV, WRBU ceased carrying UPN's prime time programming, resulting in the network's final two weeks of programming‚Äîwhich largely consisted of repeats of network shows aired during the 2005‚Äì06 television season‚Äînot being carried in St. Louis. KPLR, meanwhile, remained a WB affiliate until September 17, and officially affiliated with The CW when that network debuted the following day on September 18. As a MyNetworkTV affiliate, the station began serving as a backup NBC affiliate during occasions when KSDK (channel 5) was forced to preempt programs from that network due to commitments to air St. Louis Cardinals baseball games, the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon or locally produced specials, or because of preemptions necessitated to provide breaking news or severe weather coverage. In March 2010, Roberts Broadcasting and Univision Communications filed to formally dissolve the St. Louis/Denver LLC venture, under which Roberts acquired full ownership of WRBU in exchange for selling its interest in KTFD to Univision as compensation for buying out the latter's share in WRBU. =Bankruptcy and sale= By 2010, the Roberts brothers had begun facing serious financial trouble with their various businesses. The Roberts' broadcasting unit, in particular, had become the subject of lawsuits by Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television and CBS Television Distribution over its failure to make fee payments for syndicated programs that it acquired for its CW- and MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations (Warner Bros. and CBS would win their court disputes against Roberts, which also later reached a settlement with 20th Television); the company also was unable to fund the construction of Evansville, Indiana CW affiliate WAZE-TV's digital transmitter facilities, an issue that led the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to cancel that station's full-power license in March 2011 (WAZE continued to operate through its three analog-only low-power translators until their shutdown in January 2013). This culminated in Roberts Broadcasting filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 7, 2011. The group cited the cause of its financial downturn on the loss of the UPN affiliations on WRBU, WZRB and WRBJ-TV, on the basis that much of UPN's programming slate at the time of its shutdown consisted of shows aimed at African Americans and other minority audiences that Roberts felt were compatible with the core viewership of the stations. On February 20, 2012, Roberts announced that the company was exploring the sale of one or all four of its television stations in order to raise sufficient funding to pay off its creditors; the company would eventually sell WRBJ to the Trinity Broadcasting Network in October 2012 and WZRB to Tri-State Christian Television subsidiary Radiant Light Ministries on December 2, 2013, leaving WRBU as the last station that Roberts had yet to cut a divestiture deal. On December 4, 2013, Roberts filed to sell WRBU to Tri-State Christian Television directly for $5.5 million; however, on December 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing gave initial approval for a plan by Roberts' creditors to instead transfer WRBU and its sister stations, WZRB and former WAZE-TV translator WAZE-LP, to a trust overseen by Gary Chapman with Ion Media Networks‚Äîa creditor in Roberts' bankruptcy proceedings‚Äîas its beneficiary. The attorney representing Roberts subsequently stated that Ion Media would purchase the three stations outright. The FCC approved the deal on February 2, 2014. =As an Ion affiliate-turned-O&O;= WRBU became an Ion Television affiliate on February 10, 2014, marking the network's resumption of an over-the-air presence in the St. Louis market. Mount Vernon, Illinois-based WPXS (channel 13, now a Daystar owned-and-operated station) operated as an affiliate of Ion predecessors Pax TV and i: Independent Television during two separate tenures from 1998 to 2004 and 2005 to 2008 (Paxson Communications‚Äîwhich evolved into Ion Media following its 2005 reorganization ‚Äì owned WPXS during the first tenure; Equity Media Holdings owned the station during its tenure as an i/Ion affiliate following a one-year affiliation deferral to Daystar preceding Paxson's sale of WPXS). The network had also been available in St. Louis proper through low-power repeater KUMO-LP (channel 51), which covered portions of the St. Louis metropolitan area that had inadequate reception of the WPXS signal but had sparse cable coverage in most of the market. After WPXS dropped Ion to become a Retro Television Network affiliate in 2008, most St. Louis viewers could only receive Ion programming via cable and satellite from the network's national feed. Consequently, though, the sale to the Ion trust resulted in the company voiding WRBU's agreements with syndication distributors and with Fox Entertainment Group for the MyNetworkTV affiliation, with the network switch causing St. Louis to become the largest American television market at that time without a MyNetworkTV affiliate. The network would eventually return to the market when CBS affiliate KMOV (channel 4) relaunched its DT3 subchannel on November 17, 2014, acquiring both the MyNetworkTV affiliation and many syndicated shows formerly carried by WRBU that had lost local distribution in St. Louis because of the switch (through St. Louis' status as a top-25 market, KMOV-DT3 became the largest subchannel-only MyNetworkTV affiliate). On January 29, 2015, Cedar Creek Broadcasting (a company controlled by Brian Brady, who also owns several other broadcasting companies operating as de facto arms of his flagship group, Northwest Broadcasting) agreed to purchase WRBU and WZRB from the trust for $6 million; Ion would have provided services to the stations, which would remain Ion affiliates. On May 9, 2017, the Broadcast Trust informed the FCC that the sale to Cedar Creek Broadcasting had been terminated. One month after the Cedar Creek purchase's termination (and with the FCC restoring the UHF discount), on June 20, 2017, Ion Media Networks announced that it would purchase WRBU from the Chapman-owned/Ion-managed trust, in a two-station deal with Columbia sister station WZRB, for an undisclosed amount. The sale was completed on October 19, 2017.Consummation Notice Digital television RabbitEars TV Query for WRBU Until May 2014, WRBU transmitted its primary digital channel in 480i standard definition, making it one of the few network- affiliated stations in the United States that did not transmit an HD feed through its digital signal (internal promotions for the station's website and Facebook page that were produced during its MyNetworkTV affiliation were downconverted from 16:9 to a letterboxed 4:3 format when aired on the station). On March 10, 2014, exactly one month after the Chapman/Ion trust took ownership of the station, WRBU began carrying all five subchannel services carried by Ion Media on its Ion Television owned-and-operated stations; it also resulted in WRBU reuniting with the Home Shopping Network's over-the-air service, which Ion has carried on the DT5 feed of its stations since November 2013. On May 1, 2014, WRBU began transmitting its main feed in high definition in the network's standard 720p format. =Analog-to-digital conversion= WRBU shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 46, on January 21, 2009. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 47. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 46.

Career Levene was born in Muswell Hill, London, and was an early fan of progressive rock - at fifteen he worked as a roadie for Yes on their Close to the Edge tour. In 1976, he became a founding member of The Clash and The Flowers of Romance. Levene was responsible for helping to persuade Joe Strummer to leave the 101ers and join the Clash. Although he left The Clash before they began recording, he co-wrote \\"What's My Name\\", featured on their first album. Levene wrote the music at the Black Swan club in Sheffield when the Clash and Sex Pistols performed there in July 1976; on the same night, Levene suggested to Lydon that they consider a possible future collaboration. After the Sex Pistols disintegrated, Levene and Lydon co-founded Public Image Ltd (PiL). Levene's guitar work was later imitated by others, including The Edge of U2. Levene was one of the first guitarists to use metallic guitars, such as the Travis Bean Wedge and Artist as well as the Veleno, the latter of which was nicknamed the \\"Leveno\\" in his honour. He was involved in the writing, performing and producing of PiL's early albums: First Issue, Metal Box and Flowers of Romance. Levene left PiL in 1983 over creative differences concerning what would eventually become the band's fourth album, This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get. In 1984, he released the original versions of the songs on his own label (registered 30 January 1984 by Keith Levene, 1 Fifth Avenue, New York NY 10003, dissolved due to inactivity 26 September 1990) under the title Commercial Zone which was the original working title of the album. In 1985 he moved to Los Angeles where he formed a company with his second wife, journalist Shelly da Cunha. (registered on 19 June 1986 by Shelly Da Cunha, 830 North Kodak Drive, Los Angeles CA 90026, now suspended) In mid-1986, Levene was asked to produce demos for the album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan by the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Master Control in Burbank with engineers Steve Catania and Dan Nebenzal. Also in 1986, Levene worked together with DJ Matt Dike, experimenting with sampling techniques and hip-hop for Ice T and Tone Loc on their early recordings for Delicious. In 1989, he released his first solo release, Violent Opposition, on which members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers performed.Fused Magazine  Keith Levene interview (January 3, 2015)\\"Violent Opposition\\"  Red Hot Chili Peppers In 2003, Levene contributed to industrial rock supergroup Pigface's album Easy Listening....

At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Nathan Maverick, Levene returned with former PiL bassist Jah Wobble. In 2011 Levene contributed to three tracks on the album Psychic Life, a collaboration between Wobble and Lonelady. In early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Levene and Wobble played various venues in England, Wales and Germany as Metal Box in Dub. This was followed by the release of a four-song EP, Yin & Yang.

While preaching at a parish mission in St. Joseph Parish in Earling, Iowa, he asked the permission of the pastor to conduct the ceremony in the parish. Receiving this, he chose a convent of Franciscan Sisters on the outskirts of the town for its privacy. After 23 days of performing the exorcism, Riesinger was exhausted.

The Swedish War of Liberation (1521‚Äì23; , \\"The Liberation War\\"), also known as Gustav Vasa's Rebellion and the Swedish War of Secession, was a rebellion and a civil war in which the nobleman Gustav Vasa successfully deposed King Christian II from the throne of Sweden, ending the Kalmar Union between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.  Background  King Christian II and his ally, the Swedish Archbishop Gustav Trolle, the scion of a prominent unionist noble family, had tried to eliminate the separatist Sture party among the Swedish nobility by executing a large number of them in the Stockholm Bloodbath. The King was also unpopular for imposing high taxes on the peasantry. Furthermore, German and Danish nobles and commoners held most Swedish castles and this provoked the native Swedish nobles.  Rebellion  The war started in January 1521 when Gustav Vasa was appointed h√∂vitsman (commander) over Dalarna by representatives of the population in the northern part of the province. After Gustav Vasa sacked the copper mine of Stora Kopparberget and the town of V√§ster√•s, more men joined his army. In 1522, the Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck allied with the Swedish rebels. After the capture of Stockholm in June 1523, the rebels effectively controlled Sweden, and on 6 June Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden in the town of Str√§ngn√§s. By September, Swedish Finland was also controlled by Gustav Vasa's supporters. By the Treaty of Malm√∂ signed on 1 September 1524, Sweden seceded from the Kalmar Union.  Dalarna  In 1520, Gustav Vasa traveled to the Swedish province of Dalarna, disguised as a farmer to avoid detection by King Christian's scouts. In December, Gustav Vasa arrived in the city of Mora, where he asked the peasantry for their help in his revolt against Christian II. The peasants refused his request, so Gustav Vasa decided to travel north to find men who would support his revolt. Shortly thereafter, a couple of refugees arrived in Mora, where they told the peasantry about the brutality of Christian II and his men. The people of Mora then decided to find Gustav Vasa and join his revolt. They sent two skilled skiers to find him. In S√§len, they finally caught up with him. Back in Mora, on New Year's Eve, 1521, Gustav Vasa was appointed to \\"h√∂vitsman\\" by envoys from all the parishes of North Dalarna. In February, Gustav Vasa marched out from Mora with about 100 men and sacked Kopparberg. Shortly thereafter, the peasantry of Bergslagen joined the revolt. Gustav Vasa's army had now grown to over 1,000 men.  Battle of Brunnb√§ck Ferry  When news of the Swedish revolt reached Christian II, he sent a force of Landknechten to crush the rebellion. In April 1521, the union forces confronted Gustav Vasa's men at Brunnb√§ck Ferry, and the King's army was crushed. This victory greatly improved the Swedish rebels' morale. In Dalarna, an emergency mint was established in order to produce the copper coins necessary to finance the war.  V√§ster√•s  The rebel army continued south to V√§ster√•s, which they conquered and sacked. When words of Gustav Vasa's success spread across Sweden, the supporters of the Sture family decided to join the revolt. By the end of April 1521, Gustav Vasa controlled Dalarna, G√§strikland, N√§rke, and V√§stmanland.

Graham created his \\"Nobel sperm bank\\" in 1980. Initially, his intent was to obtain sperm only from Nobel laureates, but the scarcity of donors and the low viability of their sperm (because of age) forced Graham to develop a looser set of criteria. These criteria were numerous and exacting: for example, sperm recipients were required to be married and to have extremely high IQ, though the bank later relaxed this policy so it could recruit athletes for donors as well as scholars. By 1983, Graham's sperm bank was reputed to have 19 genius repeat donors, including William Bradford Shockley (recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics and proponent of eugenicshttps://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/shockley/shockley3.html) and two anonymous Nobel Prize in Science winners. The bank closed in 1999, two years after the death of its founder. A total of 218 children had been born under its auspices. Graham's overriding goals were the genetic betterment of the human population and the nurture of newly conceived geniuses. This was a form of \\"positive\\" eugenics, meant to increase the number of designated \\"fit\\" individuals in a population through selective breeding.

Dunnet Head includes the most northerly point of both mainland Scotland and the island of Great Britain. Geography The point, also known as Easter Head, is at grid reference , about west-northwest of John o' Groats and about from Duncansby Head. Dunnet Head can be seen also as the western limit of the Pentland Firth on the firth's southern, or Caithness, side (Duncansby Head is the eastern limit). Although Easter Head is the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland, the northernmost point of Scotland lies in the Shetland islands, approximately further north. Dunnet Head view, Scotland. Rocks are the Old Red Sandstone. The headland's boundary with the rest of the Scottish mainland can be defined as a north-south line running from Little Clett () to the mouth of Dunnet Burn () in Dunnet Bay. This line is followed along most of its route by a single track road, the B855, which links Brough with the village of Dunnet, making this the most northerly road on mainland Britain. From this line, the headland projects westward and northward into the Atlantic Ocean and the Pentland Firth and shelters the more southerly waters of Dunnet Bay. The peninsula is north-east of the burgh of Thurso, and on a clear day, it affords views of the islands of Stroma to the east, and Hoy and the Orkney Mainland, 15 km (9 miles) away to the north, across the Pentland Firth. Military use Near the Dunnet Head lighthouse are minor fortifications built during World War II to protect the naval base at Scapa Flow, including a Chain Home Low radar station and a bunker used by the Royal Observer Corps during the Cold War. Burifa Hill on Dunnet Head was the site of the master station and a monitoring station of the northern GEE chain of radio navigation stations during World War II. There was also an artillery range on Dunnet Head during World War II.

Some primatologists argue that these primates' use of the communication tools indicates their ability to use \\"language\\", although this is not consistent with some definitions of that term.  Non-human apes that demonstrate understanding  Non-human animals have been recorded to have produced behaviors that are consistent with meanings accorded to human sentence productions. (A production is a stream of lexemes with semantic content. A language is grammar and a set of lexemes. A sentence, or statement, is a stream of lexemes that obeys a grammar, with a beginning and an end.) Some animals in the following species can be said to \\"understand\\" (receive), and some can \\"apply\\" (produce) consistent, appropriate, grammatical streams of communication.

While communication appears to be a consistent feature utilized by all animals in the wild, the tendency toward autonomic behaviors and displays remains the most common among primates. Behaviors like body posture, facial expressions, vocalizations and scent production have been observed to convey information to other animals revealing emotions or alerts about potential danger. Behavior is also used to solidify hierarchical social rankings. In the natural world, affiliative behaviors such as grooming are used to promote group cohesion and relational status among primates. In contrast, displays of aggression can also create divisions among groups.  Use of sign language  Sign language and computer keyboards are used in primate language research because non-human primate vocal cords cannot close fully, and they have less control of the tongue and lower jaw. However, primates do possess the manual dexterity required for keyboard operation. Many researchers into animal language have presented the results of the studies described below as evidence of linguistic abilities in animals. Many of their conclusions have been disputed. It is now generally accepted that apes can learn to sign and are able to communicate with humans. However, it is disputed as to whether they can form syntax to manipulate such signs. = Washoe = Washoe, a common chimpanzee, was caught in the wild in 1966. When she was about ten months old, she was received by the husband-and-wife research team of Beatrix T. Gardner and R. Allen Gardner. Chimpanzees are completely dependent until two years of age and semi-dependent until the age of four. Full adult growth is reached between 12 and 16 years of age. Accordingly, the Gardners received her at an appropriate age for research into language development. The Gardners tried to make Washoe's environment as similar as possible to what a human infant with deaf parents would experience. There was always a researcher or assistant in attendance during Washoe's waking hours. Every researcher communicated with Washoe by using American Sign Language (ASL), minimizing the use of the spoken voice. The researchers acted as friends and companions to Washoe, using various games to make the learning as exciting as possible. The Gardners used many different training methods: * Imitation: After Washoe had learned a couple of words, she started, like chimpanzees usually do, to imitate naturally. For example, when she entered the Gardners' bathroom, she spontaneously made the sign for \\"toothbrush\\", simply because she saw one. * Babbling: In this case, \\"babbling\\" does not mean vocal babbling. Instead, Washoe used untaught signs to express a desire. She used a begging gesture, which was not much different from the ASL signs \\"give me\\" and \\"come\\". (Human infants who are learning sign language often babble with their hands.) * Instrumental conditioning: The researchers used instrumental conditioning strategies with Washoe. For example, they taught the word \\"more\\" by using tickling as a reward. This technique was later applied to a variety of relevant situations. The results of the Gardners' efforts were as follows: * Vocabulary: When a sign was reported by three independent observers, it was added to a checklist. The sign had to occur in an appropriate context and without prompting. The checklist was used to record the frequency of a sign. A sign had to be used at least once a day for 15 consecutive days before it was deemed to have been acquired. Alternatively, a sign had to be used at least 15 days out of 30 consecutive days. By the end of the 22nd month of the project, thirty-four signs had been learned. * Differentiation: Washoe used the sign \\"more\\" in many different situations until a more specific sign had been learned. At one point, she used the sign for \\"flower\\" to express the idea of \\"smell\\". After additional training, Washoe was eventually able to differentiate between \\"smell\\" and \\"flower\\". * Transfer: Although the same object was presented for each learning trial (a specific hat, for example), Washoe was able to use the sign for other similar objects (e.g. other hats). * Combinations: Washoe was able to combine two or three signs in an original way. For example, \\"open food drink\\" meant \\"open the fridge\\" and \\"please open hurry\\" meant \\"please open it quickly\\". Washoe also taught other chimpanzees, such as Loulis, some ASL signs without any help from humans. = Nim Chimpsky = Linguistic critics challenged the animal trainers to demonstrate that Washoe was actually using language and not symbols. The null hypothesis was that the Gardners were using conditioning to teach the chimpanzee to use hand formations in certain contexts to create desirable outcomes, and that they had not learned the same linguistic rules that humans innately learn. In response to this challenge, the chimpanzee Nim Chimpsky (whose name is a play on linguist Noam Chomsky) was taught to communicate using sign language in studies led by Herbert S. Terrace, documented in his 1987 book. Nim was taken from his mother at a young age by Terrace and put into a household of hippy-like people who had no background with sign language, nor did they use it. Nim was treated as more of a house pet than a wild animal. During his time in the house, Nim's family gave him access to both illegal and legal substances, such as marijuana and alcohol, and didn't think twice about letting him use them. Nim's experience did not begin as an observational experience due to the fact that there were no log books kept at this point in his life. It wasn't until Nim was introduced to Laura Pettito that he began his journey with learning sign language. To no surprise, Nim was almost unresponsive to sign language unless there was something in it for him if he did the sign. With many observers and trainers guiding Nim in his learning of sign language, the observations gave clear insight on what the outcome truly was. The trainers noted that Nim had made over 20,000 sequences, only for Terrace to disprove that by noticing that Nim was merely repeating signs done by his trainers. This observation had Terrace believing that, in total, Nim knew about 125 signs. After years of being a test subject, Nim became aggressive and extremely dangerous to those around him. He would attack the researchers, sending some of them to the hospital. He bit Pettito several times, which in one instance, led to her having to get 37 stitches, and he nearly tore off another woman's cheek. In his later years, Nim was housed at a ranch, supported by the Fund for Animals in Texas, where he had access to the interior of the house, and during one incident, a small household poodle barked at him, and was subsequently smashed to death by the chimpanzee. Overall, the experiment done on Nim didn't produce much useful information. Through all of the tests it is seen that Nim merely copied the signs shown to him. This experiment also showed that non-human primates are able to memorize the outcome of certain things and if they enjoy what they get from it, they are more likely to reciprocate it because their memory shows them that they can get what they want with certain signs. Due to that fact that there was little to no meaningful outcomes from this project, scientists determined that non-human primates mimic, are able to memorize things with different outcomes and they have a higher likelihood of becoming dangerous and aggressive when taken out of their natural habitat at a young age. = Koko = Dr. Francine \\"Penny\\" Patterson, a student of the Gardners, in 1972 began an ongoing program to teach ASL to a lowlands gorilla named Koko. Unlike the Gardners she did not limit her English speech around Koko, and as a result Koko was reported to understand approximately 1,000 ASL signs and 2,000 English words. Her results were similar to the Gardners' results with chimpanzees; although the gorilla learned a large number of signs, she never understood grammar or symbolic speech, and did not display any cognition beyond that of a 2‚Äì3 year old human child. Approximately 71 hours of video were taken recording Koko‚Äôs interactions and learning behaviors. While Koko‚Äôs ability to successfully produce language has been argued among researchers, behaviors that appear to mimic speech, such as breathing heavily into a telephone or other learned physical gestures have been labeled as intentional but ultimately not communicative. From a biological standpoint, non-human primates lack the correct anatomy necessary to produce the same audible speech found in humans, however vocalizations, gestures, and expressions remain a common form used to communicate in the natural world. Koko learned and was taught to compensate for this by creating cues to emulate sounds replicating speech and through her use of visual indicators.  Plastic tokens  Sarah and two other chimpanzees, Elizabeth and Peony, in the research programs of David Premack, demonstrated the ability to produce grammatical streams of token selections. The selections came from a vocabulary of several dozen plastic tokens; it took each of the chimpanzees hundreds of trials to reliably associate a token with a referent, such as an apple or banana. The tokens were chosen to be completely different in appearance from the referents. After learning these protocols, Sarah was then able to associate other tokens with consistent behaviors, such as negation, name-of, and if-then. The plastic tokens were placed on a magnetic slate, within a rectangular frame in a line. The tokens had to be selected and placed in a consistent order (a grammar) in order for the trainers to reward the chimpanzees. One other chimpanzee, Gussie, was trained along with Sarah but failed to learn a single word. Other chimpanzees in the projects were not trained in the use of the tokens. All nine of the chimpanzees could understand gestures, such as supplication when asking for food; similarly, all nine could point to indicate some object, a gesture which is not seen in the wild. The supplication is seen in the wild, as a form of communication with other chimpanzees. Premack and Premack, The mind of an ape. A juvenile Sumatran orangutan Aazk (named after the American Association of Zookeepers) who lived at the Roeding Park Zoo (Fresno, California) was taught by Gary L. Shapiro from 1973 to 1975 how to \\"read & write\\" with plastic children's letters, following the training techniques of David Premack. The technique of conditional discrimination was used such that the orangutan could eventually distinguish plastic letter (symbols) as representations of referents (e.g., object, actions) and \\"read\\" an increasingly longer series of symbols to obtain a referent (e.g., fruit) or \\"write\\" an increasingly longer series of symbols to request or describe a referent. While no claim of linguistic competence was made, Aazk's performance demonstrated design features of language, many similar to those demonstrated by Premack's chimpanzee, Sarah. = Kanzi = Kanzi, a bonobo, is believed to understand more human language than any other non-human animal in the world. Kanzi apparently learned by eavesdropping on the keyboard lessons researcher Sue Savage-Rumbaugh was giving to her adoptive mother. Kanzi learned to communicate with a lexigram board, pushing symbols that stand for words. The board is wired to a computer, so the word is then vocalized out loud by the computer. This helps Kanzi develop his vocabulary and enables him to communicate with researchers. One day, Rumbaugh used the computer to say to Kanzi, \\"Can you make the dog bite the snake?\\" It is believed Kanzi had never heard this sentence before. In answering the question, Kanzi searched among the objects present until he found a toy dog and a toy snake, put the snake in the dog's mouth, and used his thumb and finger to close the dog's mouth over the snake. In 2001, Alexander Fiske-Harrison, writing in the Financial Times, observed that Kanzi was \\"asked by an invisible interrogator through head- phones (to avoid cueing) to identify 35 different items in 180 trials. His success rate was 93 percent.\\"Fiske-Harrison, Alexander 'Talking With Apes', Financial Times, Weekend, 24‚Äì25 November 2001 In further testing, beginning when he was years old, Kanzi was asked 416 complex questions, responding correctly over 74% of the time. Kanzi has been observed verbalizing a meaningful noun to his sister.Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, Smithsonian magazine, November 2006 Kanzi highly relied on the lexigrams for communication, and frequently uses it to specify where he wanted to go, or an item he wanted to have. He did this by expressing his goal (location or object) first, and his action (go, chase, carry, give, etc.) last. This notified researchers that Kanzi's way of communicating was different from that of spoken English, especially because Kanzi would communicate many of his action words using simple gestures. In addition, Kanzi was frequently seen linking two action words together using the lexigrams, like \\" 'I Tickle,' \`Chase Hide,' or \`Chase Bite' \\". These word combinations aren't necessarily structured in a way that humans would use spoken English, but they closely resemble lists, consisting of preferred actions, in preferred order of Kanzi's social play. Because of this inconsistency of Kanzi's use of language with the spoken English language, many question ‚ÄúWhether Kanzi actually crosses the boundary with true language...\\".  Attempts to Mimic Human Speech and Communication  Great apes mimicking human speech is rare although some have attempted to do so, and Viki, a chimpanzee, is one of them. During the 1940s and 1950s, Keith and Catherine Hayes of the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology began working with a chimpanzee named Viki in an attempt to get her to mimic human speech. After undergoing months of speech therapy, Viki became their success story. Viki learned to say the words: ‚Äúmama‚Äù, ‚Äúpapa‚Äù, ‚Äúcup‚Äù and ‚Äúup‚Äù. Over the years she learned to say up to seven words. Viki was extremely intelligent and like many other non-human primates, would lead people to where she wanted to go as well as move the hands of people onto objects she wanted them to manipulate. However, she would rarely point to objects that she wanted, instead she would use signs to indicate what she wanted to do. For example, when she wanted to help with ironing she would move her hand back and forth above the ironing board. This experiment with Viki would inspire other researchers to conduct similar experiments. Question asking Despite their impressive (although still sometimes disputed) achievements, Kanzi and other apes, who participated in similar experiments, failed to ask questions themselves. Joseph Jordania suggested that the ability to ask questions is probably the central cognitive element that distinguishes human and animal cognitive abilities. (However, a parrot named Alex was apparently able to ask simple questions. He asked what color he was, and learned \\"grey\\" after being told the answer six times.) Enculturated apes, who underwent extensive language training programs, successfully learned to answer quite complex questions and requests (including question words \\"who\\", \\"what\\", \\"when\\", \\"where\\", and \\"why\\"), although so far they failed to learn how to ask questions themselves. For example, David and Anne Premack wrote: \\"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions ‚Äì unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\\". The ability to ask questions is sometimes assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures. Jordania suggested that this approach is not justified, as (1) questioning is primarily a cognitive ability, and (2) questions can be asked without the use of syntactic structures (with the use of specific intonation only). It is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of language development, with the use of question intonation.  Criticisms of primate language research  Some scientists, including MIT linguist Noam Chomsky and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, are skeptical about claims made for great ape language research. Among the reasons for skepticism are the differences in ease with which human beings and apes can learn language; there are also questions of whether there is a clear beginning and end to the signed gestures and whether the apes actually understand language or are simply doing a clever trick for a reward. While vocabulary words from American Sign Language are used to train the apes, native users of ASL may note that mere knowledge of ASL's vocabulary does not equate to knowledge of ASL.

It offers more than 50 degrees through two-year, four-year, and graduate programs. The degree programs emphasize the liberal arts, science and technology, and graduate and professional studies. It was founded in 1908, soon after Oklahoma was admitted as a state, as one of six agricultural high schools in the largely rural region.Soelle, Sally Bradstreet. \\"Cameron University.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed August 15, 2018. History The Oklahoma Legislature created six agricultural high schools in each judicial district in 1908, a year after statehood. Lawton was chosen over Anadarko in April 1909 to receive a high school; the town had already set aside a portion of land to develop a higher educational institution. The University Improvement Association, under the auspices of the Lawton Chamber of Commerce, organized the effort to acquire of land two miles (three kilometers) west of the town. Its original goal was to secure a private Baptist college. Arrangements with the Baptists fell through in the summer of 1908. The Catholic Church approached the Association with an offer to found an all-male institution on the site. This plan was rejected by the town leaders, who were predominately Protestant. What was known as the Cameron State School of Agriculture was named for Rev. E. D. Cameron, a Baptist minister and Oklahoma's first State Superintendent of Schools. The first classes were held on Statehood Day, November 16, 1909, in the basement of a bank building, while a new campus building was being constructed. In 1927 Cameron added junior college-level classes to the school's offerings, when local higher education needs exceeded what was available in southwest Oklahoma. With this expansion, the institution was renamed as Cameron State Agricultural College. By 1941, the high school preparatory classes were dropped. Cameron was classified solely as a junior college that year, when the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education was formed and joined the group of institutions governed by the Board of Regents of Oklahoma A&M; Colleges. Based on additional development of programs and curriculum, in 1966 the legislation passed a bill authorizing the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education to allow the college to award Baccalaureate degrees. The institution's name was shortened to Cameron College in 1971 and, with more program expansion, changed to Cameron University in 1974. As the 1970s continued, Cameron demonstrated its dedication to expanded academic offerings through the construction of a fine arts facility designed to serve students in theatre, music, broadcasting, and speech communication. Dr. Donald J. Owen served as Cameron's president from 1969 to 1980. A Cameron graduate, Owen worked to build academic programs and develop relationships with the Lawton community, as well as the Oklahoma State University system, under which CU fell during his tenure. Cameron's sports teams, particularly football and basketball, excelled during that time. A new President's residence was constructed on Gore Boulevard, west of the campus. In 1988, State Regents expanded Cameron's functions to include graduate offerings at the master's degree level. This was the first change granted to an Oklahoma institution since Cameron was given the authority to offer bachelor's degrees more than 20 years earlier. In the 1990s, Cameron University came under the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma. Don Davis was President of Cameron University from 1980 to 2002. His father, Clarence L. Davis, was President of Cameron from 1957 to 1960. As a child, Davis lived in the President's house on campus with his parents and sister. As a former legislator from Lawton, Davis was able to secure funding for Cameron that supported it in developing as the premier institute for higher education in southwestern Oklahoma. Also during Davis' tenure, a classical radio station, KCCU 89.3, was founded. Numerous renowned scholars, including Richard Leakey and Cornel West, have spoken at Cameron's annual Academic Festival. In May 2004, Cameron took over the Duncan Higher Education Center in Duncan, Oklahoma. It was renamed as Cameron University - Duncan. =Presidents= Since its founding in 1908, Cameron University has had 17 presidents. * J. A. Liner, 1908‚Äì1912 * Ralph K. Robertson, 1912‚Äì1913 * E. M.

Production of the RT 125 model began in Moscow under the M1A brand. By the Order No.494 of the Ministry of automotive industry of the Soviet Union dated July 12, 1951 the production of M1A was transferred from Moscow to the Minsk Motorcycle and Bicycle Plant (MMVZ, then Motovelo). M1A became the basis of simple and reliable classic Minsk models, the history of which continues to this day. This model was imported into the United Kingdom by Neval Motorcycles, marketed as Neval. MMVZ Minsk motorcycles rapidly gained popularity both in the Soviet Union and in foreign markets. They have been delivered to and sold in 45 countries, and the total number has exceeded 6.5 million. From the early years the Minsk brand has been actively involved in motor sports, especially in motocross and circuit racing. Minsk-Pamir (1969) and Brest-Vladivostok (1971) rallies became the Iconic milestone in the Minsk brand history. The new models code name system was introduced in 1973 with the new Minsk MMVZ-3.111, which received the State Quality Mark of the USSR. 1973 Minsk MMVZ-3.111 Codename system developed by the USSR Moto Industry Institute: * MMVZ - factory; * 3 - motorcycle class (up to 125 cm3); * 1 - type (road bike); * 11 - factory model code.

A Minsk motorcycle was featured in Top Gear's Vietnam Special, ridden by Richard Hammond. Chris Hunt wrote about his experience in riding a Minsk motorcycle along the Ho Chi Minh trail after the Vietnam War in his book Sparring With Charlie: Motorbiking Down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Minsk motorcycles were among the Soviet motorcycles that were distributed by SATRA, UK, under the Minsk Saturn 125 and Cossack brand names from 1973 to 1979. Satra was originally located in Surrey, later moving to Carnaby. By the early 90s the Minsk motorcycle production was brought to 220,000 units per year. In 1999, the Minsk brand received the Arch of Europe award for the approval on the international market. M1NSK Three M1NSK TRX 300 at Brest-Dushanbe rally In 2007 Motovelo became the private company.

The population in 2011 was 139,309,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 215.88 km¬≤. History  Castle at Santa Maria da Feira Santa Maria is located in area that allowed it to be a crossroads of various peoples. Ancient Roman roadways connected Porto, Viseu, Lisbon and Braga and intersected the region, and was used until the 19th century. In addition, pre-Roman castros dotted the territory. Eventually, nomadic tribes began to settle in the vicinity of the castle. This settlement soon became known as the Terra de Santa Maria. This name first appeared in 1117, in a donation by D. Teresa, who began to reside in the castle around 1120. The lands of Santa Maria included a vast territory that included not only the municipality of Feira, but also Ovar, Vila Nova de Gaia, Vale de Cambra and S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira, among others. The castle of Santa Maria da Feira, the ex-libris of Feira, is a testament to the military architecture of the Middle Ages. It is the fulcrum of the history of the region, and an important point in the Reconquista. In the time of king Denis of Portugal, Feira already was the see of a julgado (old administrative division). This is testified by an ancient document called Foral Velho. It was awarded a new foral in 1514, when Manuel I of Portugal was the King of Portugal.  Art  Danonaselo is a sculpture created by San Damon at the very beginning of the creation of Oniroscopism in 2004 and even before. It is part of the S.O.G. series (Geometric Oniroscopic Sculpture). Danonaselo is a very specific proper name given by San Damon to this sculpture. All the difficulty comes from the fact that Damon had to move from 2D drawing to 3D sculpture with the particular twists and angles that emerge from the strange character. Indeed, the night lighting surrounding the Danonaselo and the daylight that illuminates it, and in particular the presence of the sun that revolves around it, makes us see a totally different character. Shadows are thrown to the ground and angles are projected on the facades. The Danonaselo is placed for life in a public square in Portugal, in Fi√£es in the entity of Santa Maria da Feira and is part of the Portuguese heritage. The work is three metres high and looks out, as San Damon wanted, towards the ocean through the lands of Mozelos, Lourosa, S√£o Paio de Oleiros, etc. The roundabout on which the Danonaselo is placed is decorated with certain flowers in harmony with the work. A plaque on the base explains the meaning of the work and a poem written by San Damon encloses it. Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:left;\\"  } The municipality includes several towns (vilas) and 3 cities (cidades): Santa Maria da Feira, Fi√£es and Lourosa.

The town is the headquarters of Amorim corporation. The seat of the municipality is Feira, famous for its medieval castle which was the residence of Portugal's first king, Afonso Henriques, for a short period of time. The castle, located at the top of a hill, was of considerable strategic importance during its time. Every year, in summer, a medieval festival takes place in Santa Maria da Feira - the Viagem Medieval - during which the city goes back to the Middle Ages. Architecture The municipality's sights include the Convento do Esp√≠rito Santo (convent), the Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia (church; 18th century), and the Rua Direita (street; 18th and 19th century architecture). However, its greatest landmark is the castelo Santa Maria da Feira Castle, from the 11th century. Culture Medieval festival parade Foga√ßa - typical sweet bread The municipal holiday is January 20. It's the day when the whole municipality celebrates the Fogaceiras. The Fogaceiras is a special local holiday. During the Middle Ages, the lands of Santa Maria (as it was known back then) were infested by the dark plague. To get rid of this calamity, the locals offered a sweet roll, called foga√ßa, to the patron saint Saint Sebastien. The Fogaceiras have been celebrated for five hundred years, since the eradication of the dark plague. The municipality has a science museum, the Visionarium. Sport C.D.

Suell's career coincided with the American Revolution, a period of political disorder in the chief tobacco-growing regions of North America. These events broke the power of the tobacco lairds based in Glasgow and other British port cities, and made it possible for Suell to import tobacco directly from North America.

History The Unhas Negras workers of the felt industry, immortalized by Jo√£o da Silva Correia The origins of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira extend back to the consecutive settlements by Celt, Roman, Moors and Visigoths. Yet, historically the first mention of S√£o Jo√£o occurred in 1088: the first reference was the phrase \\"Uilla de Sancto Ioanne de Mateira\\", that appeared in the sale of lands in the territory. The designation of \\"Madeira\\" that appeared was in reference to the abundance of trees and forest, that continued to exist in the region. In the 19th century, S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira registered an intense growth, the fruit of commercial and industrial development linked to the manufacture of hats and dairy industry. J. Gomes de Pinho was the first empressario to establish a hat factory in 1802, but it was Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Oliveira J√∫nior, an ex-functionary who would drive the local industry with his establishment in 1892 of the first fur hat factory. It would eventually become one of the major symbols of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira's new economy, the Empresa Industrial de Chapelaria Lda. Totally mechanized by the early 19th century, it would become the largest factory in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the 19th century. Oliveira J√∫nior was recognized by the national government, who issued him a diploma of Industrial and Agricultural Merit, its citizens later honouring him with a bust and the naming of one of its roads. The prosperity that developed, also supported by the nacscent growth of the footwear industry, allowed the growth of a dynamic centre that attracted more inhabitants with the possibility of work. With progress and modernization there was a radical alteration in the architecture of the community. The primitive church was demolished in 1883, and the following year the new temple was blessed and inaugurated (11 July 1888). In 1908 King Manuel II of Portugal inaugurated the Caminho de Ferro do Vale do Vouga (Vouga Valley Railline) which, along with the construction of new streets and roads allowed the parallel growth of the region. With the construction of the local hospital, the introduction of electricity into the region was finally concluded, while at the same time the cultural arena was enhanced with the establishment of the Grupo Patri√≥tico Sanjoanense a philharmonic band and cultural centre (led by the Jesuit priest and histographer Serafim Leite). It was not until 11 October 1926 that the region achieved both economic and political autonomy as a full municipality, a fact that was seen by locals as enviable due to its inferior status administratively (until then it was a civil parish of the neighbouring municipality of Oliveira de Azem√©is). Its independence was recorded in the local newspaper O Regional as born of a group of young people with blood that boiled in their veins and anxious for the constant progress of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira\\". At that time, the Portuguese government considered S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira one of the most important regional industrial centres with its progress suffocated by its inferior status. S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira became a city at 28 June 1984, by the law n.¬∫ 13/84. By the second World War, the felt industry grew in Portugal, and during the 1940s the production of fur and felt production was centralized in the factories of the municipality, with the establishment of the Cortadoria Nacional do P√™lo, which was nationalized in 1945. In 1946, 1775 people worked in the hat-making industrial in Portugal, while 1212 were located in S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira. The activity of this industry was later immortalized by Jo√£o da Silva Correia, in his romance \\"Unhas Negras\\", a pejorative reference to the works who worked the open cauldrons that darken and destroyed their fingernails (unhas negrasliterally means darken/blacken fingernails). The term was later generally used to identify the citizenry of the municipality. The use of the word \\"Labor\\", on the coat-of- arms of the municipality, was intended to signify the importance of these workers in the development of the region. Regardless, the hat-making industries slowly declined in the following decades, with the decline in the use of hats, and the shoe-making industry grew in importance, resulting in its reference as the \\"Capital of Footwear\\" in Portugal (). Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The Municipal Garden and Forum, along the Avenida da Liberidade The built-up landscape of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira, as seen from the Complexo de Piscinas The municipality of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira is situated in the extreme north of the district of Aveiro, in the historical region of Beira Litoral, occupying a position central in the subregion of Entre Douro e Vouga. It is approximately 18 kilometres from the Portuguese Atlantic coast, 32 kilometres from the regional capital of Porto, 40 kilometres from Aveiro and 275 kilometres from the national capital. It straddles the a hilltop portion of the geomorphological massif that extends from 50 to 400 metres above sea level. It is crossed at its farthest limit by the River Ul, which runs north to south. The climate in this region is maritime in character, with heavy winter rainfall countered by short dry summers. It is limited in the north by the civil parish of Milheir√≥s de Poiares and west by Arrifana (both in the municipality of Santa Maria da Feira), while its southern border aligns with the civil parishes of Cucuj√£es and S√£o Roque and eastern frontier with Nogueira do Cravo and Macieira de Sarnes (in the municipality of Oliveira de Azem√©is. S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira is a rare example of a municipality with only one civil parish (). Apart from its small dimensions, S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira is the second largest city in the district of Aveiro and the largest in the Entre Douro e Vouga subregion. Economy The Centro Empresarial e Tecnol√≥gico business incubator for technological innovation in the region The Travessas Industrial Zone, a modern agglomeration of industry and business incubator Its economy is based on services and industry, employing 62% in secondary and 38% in tertiary sectors. In 2007, there were 3660 registered companies dominated by micro and small businesses and employing 74% of the workers. S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira's motto, translated as \\"Labor, City of Work\\", appeals to its industrial history. In 2007, there were 3660 companies in S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira: despite being the smallest municipality in size in Portugal, it is the twentieth in economic turnover. It is the head of shoe industry in Portugal, an important industrial activity in Portugal, having the seat of the Shoe Technological Centre. Beyond that, the city is developing a Science Park and main Centro Empresarial e Tecnol√≥gico (Business and Technology Centre), as well as important commercial, financial and service centre of the region, having its largest Shopping Mall and largest concentration of banks. Inaugurated in 2008 by President An√≠bal Cavaco Silva the Centre is a modern project by architext Filipe Oliveira Dias, that services as an incubator for high technology businesses in order to diversify the local market. It is actually the first of ten buildings in the zone, of a planned 80,000 square metre technological park, including the N√∫cleo de Investiga√ß√£o e Desenvolvimento (Investigation and Development Nucleus). In 2009, a series of protocols of understanding were signed to establish a regional network of \\"Innovation and Competitivity\\" between business and education, in order to foster technological innovation. Shoe manufacturing has been one of the city's main economic industries, and regularly, the city has been referred to as \\"a Capital do Cal√ßado\\" (the Capital of Footwear); many of Portugal's shoe manufacturers and ancillary businesses, including the Centro Tecnol√≥gico do Cal√ßado (Footwear Technology Centre) and Centro de Forma√ß√£o Profissional da Ind√∫stria do Cal√ßado (Footwear Industry Centre for Professional Learning) are based in S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira. Similarly, regional industries have been responsible for the production of 20% the world's felt hats and continues to be the major national producer. The quality of S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira's head apparel has, at one time, been recognized internationally, and incorporated in fashion house (such as Herm√®s). In addition, the movie industry was responsible for supporting this industry, with headwear produced for films such as Public Enemies,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Indiana Jones' hat, for example) and the Mad Hatter's famous hat in Alice in Wonderland. Other secondary industries in the economy include automobile components, industrial textiles, mattresses, glues and tubing manufacturing, which are concentrated in four industrial zones: Travessas, Orreiro, Devesa- Velha e Oliva. Its central place within the urban hierarchy has slowly consolidated many of the main services of the Entre Douro e Vouga subregion; along with Santa Maria da Feira it has contributed to the policentralizism of Greater Porto basin. S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira is an important banking and financial centre; in 2007, there were 1288 employed in the banking sector, equivalent to the same number in Aveiro. Education In 2014 the town's schools began Mandarin language education.\\"Mandatory Mandarin: Portuguese kids take compulsory Chinese class.\\" Russia Today. November 2, 2014. Retrieved on November 4, 2014. Tourism Industrial tourism has increased, and S. Jo√£o da Madeira was the first city in the country to introduce this tourism. The routes include the only pencil factory in operation in Portugal, the shoe industry and the head-wear industry. A Vocational Training Centre of the Footwear Industry and the Portuguese Technological Footwear Centre are part of this industrial tourism route, as well as the Hat Museum, one symbol of the city and unique in the Iberian Peninsula.

Biography Born in 1881 at Englefield in the English county of Berkshire, Dixon was influenced by the reformist labour politics of his home country, and also favoured the single tax ideas of Henry George. He apprenticed as a gardener in England. Dixon arrived in Manitoba in 1903, settling in Winnipeg. He apprenticed as a draftsman and worked as an engraver. He was a member of the Independent Labour Party during this period, and opposed the efforts of some party members to declare the ILP as socialist. This controversy led to the disintegration of the ILP in 1908. Dixon also wrote a weekly column in the Winnipeg labour weekly The Voice. Dixon first ran for the provincial legislature in the 1910 provincial election as a candidate of the Manitoba Labour Party. He was also supported by the provincial Liberal Party, whose platform he generally supported. Dixon's centrist labourism brought about opposition from the Socialist Party of Canada, which ran a spoiler candidate against him. Dixon lost to Conservative Thomas Taylor by 73 votes; the SPC polled 99. In 1914, he married Winona Margaret Flett, a suffragist. The SPC's actions provoked a backlash among the Winnipeg trade unions, and increased Dixon's popularity in the city. He ran as an independent in the provincial election of 1914, receiving support from both the Liberals and the Labour Representation Committee (a successor to the MLP). His platform included home rule for Winnipeg, women's suffrage, public ownership of utilities, removal of subsidies for private enterprise and a referendum on temperance. Despite further SPC opposition, he was elected for Winnipeg Centre \\"B\\". In the assembly, Dixon played an important role in forcing an investigation into corruption associated with the construction of new Manitoba legislative buildings, which led to the downfall of the Robson government in 1915. He was again returned in the 1915 election, as an \\"Independent Progressive\\". During World War I, Dixon emerged as one of the leading anti- conscriptionists in Winnipeg, and also defended the rights of conscientious objectors to the war effort. These efforts placed him in conflict with the Manitoba Liberals, who generally supported the conscription policies of Robert Borden's Unionist government. In March 1918, Dixon helped to found the first branch of the Dominion Labour Party in Winnipeg and served as its first president. Though never a strong or centralized party, the DLP would subsequently branch out to other cities in the Canadian prairies. Dixon supported the strikers during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, and undoubtedly played an important role in legitimizing their efforts among the city's reformist labourites. After the editors of the Strike Bulletin were arrested, he published the Western Star and Enlightener. Dixon was subsequently accused of seditious libel for his activities during the strike, defended himself, and was found not guilty. In the provincial election of 1920, Dixon headed a united labour list in the city of Winnipeg, which had been re-designed as a single constituency with ten members elected by a single transferable ballot. He easily topped the poll with 11,586 votes, almost 7000 more than his nearest Liberal competitor. There can be little doubt that Dixon was the most popular politician in the city at the time. Nine DLP supporters, along with one member apiece from the SPC and SDPC, were elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1920. Dixon was the unquestioned leader of the labour parliamentary caucus. He was able to cooperate with more left-wing figures, and kept the group reasonably united through to the election of 1922. In late 1920, the DLP in Winnipeg was taken over by rightist labourites who had opposed the General Strike. Dixon led a walkout of DLP members, and was involved in founding the province's new Independent Labour Party. The ILP became the primary voice of the parliamentary left in Manitoba, and later become part of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Dixon again topped the Winnipeg list in 1922, albeit by the reduced margin of almost 4000 votes over the nearest Liberal. The total labour caucus was reduced to six members. In 1923, Dixon resigned as a Member of the Legislative Assembly following the death of his wife and two of his children. John Queen, formerly of the SDPC, became ILP leader in his place. Dixon spent the rest of his life working as a part-time insurance salesman and died of cancer at the age of fifty. The tragedy of his later years robbed Canada's labour movement of one of its most dynamic voices.

It is in the westernmost part of the Isles of Scilly, an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. The Guinness Book of Records lists it as the world's smallest island with a building on it. The original iron lighthouse was begun in 1847 but was washed away before it could be completed. The present building was completed in 1858 and was first lit on 1September that year. Before the installation of the helipad, visitors to the lighthouse would rappel from the top (with winches installed at the lamp level and at the base below) to boats waiting away from the lighthouse. Bishop Rock is also at the eastern end of the North Atlantic shipping route used by ocean liners in the first half of the 20th century; the western end being the entrance to Lower New York Bay. This was the route that ocean liners took when competing for the Transatlantic speed record, known as the Blue Riband. History In the late 13th century, when the Isles of Scilly were under the jurisdiction of John de Allet and his wife Isabella, anyone convicted of felony \\"ought to be taken to a certain rock in the sea, with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water and left until the sea swallowed him up\\". The rock was originally recorded as Maen Escop in 1284 and Maenenescop in 1302. In Cornish, Men Eskop means \\"Bishop's Stone\\", whilst Men an Eskop means \\"the Stone of the Bishop\\". The outer rocks to the west of St Agnes also used to be known as the Bishop and Clerk, but exactly how they acquired these similar names is not known for certain. A possible explanation is that the shape of the rock is similar to a bishop's mitre. East of Bishop Rock are the Western Rocks and the Gilstone Reef, where Admiral Shovell's flagship HMS Association was wrecked in the great naval disaster of 1707. Shovell's remains were repatriated to England by order of Queen Anne shortly after their initial burial in the Isles of Scilly. The earliest recorded wreck on the rock itself was in 1839, when the brig Theodorick struck in rough misty weather on 4September. She was out of Mogodore for London carrying a general cargo. In the early hours of , the 600-tonne paddle steamer Brigand, a packet boat, which was en route from Liverpool to St Petersburg, struck the rock with such force that it stove in two large bow plates. The rocks then acted as a pivot, and she swung round and heeled into the rock port side, crushing the paddle-wheel and box to such an extent that it penetrated the engine room. She drifted over seven miles in two hours, before sinking in 90m. All the crew were saved. In 1901 a barque named Falkland struck the rock, her main yard hitting the lighthouse itself. Lighthouse Bishop Rock screw-pile first lighthouse according to a drawing by Jos√© Eugenio Ribera. An 1818 report by the Surveyor‚ÄìGeneral of the Duchy of Cornwall on the dangers to shipping in Cornwall proposed that a lighthouse be built, similar to the Eddystone Lighthouse, upon Bishop Rock, given its location as the westernmost rock of the Isles of Scilly. The plan was considered by the government and building was expected soon, as the engineer John Rennie the Elder made an offer to build it. The government did not take up the offer, but Trinity House surveyed Bishop Rock in 1843, with a view to building a lighthouse, and work began in 1847. The engineer in chief, James Walker, decided on a design consisting of accommodation and a light on top of iron legs. The light was never lit, since on a storm washed the tower away. In the second attempt, James Walker began building a stone structure in 1851. The site presented a number of difficulties: the paucity of available land area and the slope of the rock meant that the lowest stone had to be laid below the low water level of the lowest spring tides.Nicholson, op. cit., p. 116 The resident engineer was Nicholas Douglass assisted by first James and then William, his son. Despite multiple problems, the tower was completed without loss of life. It was fitted with a large (first order) fixed catadioptric optic by Henry L√©paute, and shone its light for the first time on . The total cost of the lighthouse was ¬£34,559. Faced with the full force of the Atlantic, however, the building proved vulnerable: in heavy weather the tower regularly shook, the vibrations being powerful enough to cause objects to fall from shelves, and even causing the optical apparatus to fracture. The lighthouse had initially been provided with a 3cwt fog bell; however this was washed away during a storm in January1860. (It was replaced with a larger bell, but not until 1864; the bell was sounded once every ten seconds). =Renovation= In 1881, various other expediencies having been tried in the meantime, Sir James Nicholas Douglass inspected the tower and designed a renovation to reinforce the structure by laying massive granite blocks into the rock and dove-tailing them onto the lighthouse. The renovations increased its height by . The work began in 1882 and completed in 1887, under the supervision of Douglass's eldest surviving son, William Tregarthen Douglass. The new improved light had a range of . The optic was designed and built by Chance Brothers and was 'biform' (having two identical lamps and lens arrays, one mounted above the other). Each tier consisted of an eight-wick paraffin burner set within a revolving array of extra large hyperradiant Fresnel lenses (consisting, on each level, of five pairs of lens panels, displaying two white flashes every minute). In clear weather the lower tier alone was used, with its lamp on half power; in limited visibility (as judged by the clarity of the light visible from St Agnes's Lighthouse, away) both tiers were used with the lamps at full power. The heavy optic was turned by a small air engine placed in the pedestal; compressed air was provided from a set of tanks, located in the room below along with a pair of Davey 'Safety' Engines, which drove the compressors. The compressed air could also be used, by day, to drive a small gallery-mounted winch for landing stores. As part of the renovation, the lighthouse was equipped with an explosive fog signal: in foggy weather the keepers regularly had to attach a guncotton charge together with a detonator to a jib-type apparatus on the lantern gallery; from inside the lantern they would then raise the jib and fire the charge electrically. The explosive signal remained in use until 1976. =Current era= The paraffin lamps remained in service until 1973, when the light was converted to electricity. Difficulty reaching the lighthouse by boat led Trinity House to build a helipad on top of the lighthouse in 1976.Nicholson, op. cit., p. 126 That same year a supertyfon fog horn was installed with sounders arranged around the gallery. On 15 December 1992 the tower became fully automated;Nicholson, op. cit., p. 127 the lower half of the biform optic remains in use but following automation the top half was removed and put on display (it is currently in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall). An electric fog signal replaced the supertyfon at this time, sounding a long followed by a short tone every 90seconds; its use was discontinued in 2007. On the 144th anniversary of the destruction of James Walker's original iron tower (), a storm caused severe damage to the gunmetal entry doors, which had to be replaced; they too became an exhibit at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth. =Structure= Bishop Lighthouse is often referred to as \\"King of the lighthouses\\" and it is indeed a very impressive structure. With a height of the lighthouse is the equal tallest in England, together with Eddystone Lighthouse. Expenditure on the lighthouses at Bishop Rock, include: The first iron lighthouse: ¬£12,500Bishop Rock Lighthouse Trinity House. Retrieved 22 April 2016 The second granite lighthouse: ¬£34,559 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) The third improved lighthouse: ¬£64,889 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) Total cost: ¬£111,948 The interior of the light house consists of the following: Below and inside the lighthouse are 10floors with spiral staircase to the 2nd floor with a door (made from gun metal (likely bronze) and installed in 1887) that leads down an external metal (likely bronze) ladder to climb down to the large exterior base. From the base another metal ladder provides access to a stone staircase to the waterline. The floors of the lighthouse are occupied as follows: * 1st floor ‚Äì Water tank (providing fresh water for lighthouse keepers) * 2nd floor ‚Äì Entrance room with metal door leading to exterior ladder to base below * 3rd floor ‚Äì Store room, with window * 4th floor ‚Äì First oil room, with oil tanks formerly used to light the lamp * 5th floor ‚Äì Second oil room, with window * 6th floor ‚Äì Living room for lighthouse keepers, with window * 7th floor ‚Äì Bedroom for lighthouse keepers, with window * 8th floor ‚Äì Store room * 9th floor ‚Äì Service room * 10th floor ‚Äì Lamp Culture The rock is the subject of a short orchestral descriptive work by the late Doreen Carwithen (Mary Alwyn) which has been recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Richard Hickox. The lighthouse was used as a filming location for one of the current BBC One Idents and was also featured in the last segment of the documentary series Three Men in More Than One Boat. The lighthouse was also featured in the 2010 BBC documentary Islands of Britain, hosted by Martin Clunes. The lighthouse featured in BBC TV children's programme Blue Peter in 1975, when presenter Lesley Judd visited. \\"Disaster nearly struck as she travelled by rope to the lighthouse from a boat.

Ross came from a Scottish background, his family being in shipping in Liverpool. His mother died when he was a baby and he was brought up by his father, who held the MC, in London. Educated at Bedford School, he went into the Royal Navy aged 18 in 1944 and served four years on the lower decks, which he claimed was the best thing that ever happened to him. In 1948 he joined his uncle's firm in Kidderminster, which was an auction and cattle market. He qualified as a chartered surveyor and land agent. He went to the Isle of Wight in 1953 to secure a better job, and in 1958 tried to join the Liberal Party but 'no one wanted to know'. He finally joined in 1961 and in the 1964 election worked for an elderly lady candidate 'who was slightly muddled about who was Prime Minister'. He decided things could not go on like that and fought the 1966 election himself with his wife, Brenda, and a few friends, covering the island by Land Rover. He did the same in 1970, by which time he had become a county councillor.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-ross-of- newport-2322415.html Ross was Leader of Isle of Wight County Council 1973-74 and 1981-83.

Marx distinguished between the capacity to do work, labour power, from the physical act of working, labour. Labour power exists in any kind of society, but on what terms it is traded or combined with means of production to produce goods and services has historically varied greatly. Under capitalism, according to Marx, the productive powers of labour appear as the creative power of capital. Indeed, \\"labour power at work\\" becomes a component of capital, it functions as working capital. Work becomes just work, workers become an abstract labour force, and the control over work becomes mainly a management prerogative. Definition Karl Marx introduces the concept in chapter 6 of the first volume of Capital, as follows: :\\"By labour-power or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any description.\\" He adds further on that: :\\"Labour-power, however, becomes a reality only by its exercise; it sets itself in action only by working. But thereby a definite quantity of human muscle, nerve. brain, &c.;, is wasted, and these require to be restored.\\" A much shorter, to-the-point explanation of labour-power can be found in the introduction and second chapter of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital (1847). Another short exposition is provided in Marx's text Value, Price and Profit (1865). Versus labour Marx adapted a distinction, in Hegel's Elements of the Philosophy of Right between labour power (Arbeitskraft) and labour (Arbeit) and gave this distinction a new significance. For Marx, Arbeitskraft, which he sometimes instead refers to as Arbeitsverm√∂gen (\\"labour-ability\\" or \\"labour-capacity\\") refers to a \\"force of nature\\": the physical ability of human beings and other living things to perform work, including mental labour and skills such as manual dexterity, in addition to sheer physical exertion. Labour power is, in this sense, also the aspect of labour that becomes a commodity within capitalist society and is alienated from labourers when it is sold to capitalists. By contrast, \\"labour\\" may refer to all or any activity by humans (and other living creatures) that is concerned with producing goods or services (or what Marx calls use-values). In this sense, the usage of labour (per se) in Marxian economics is somewhat similar to the later concept, in neoclassical economics, of \\"labour services\\". The distinction between labour and labour-power, according to Marx, helped to solved a problem that David Ricardo had failed to solve, i.e. explaining why the surplus value resulting from profit normally arises out of the process of production itself‚Äîrather than in the investment of capital (e.g. the advance of money-capital in the form of wages) in labour-power (acquired from labourers). While Marx's concept of labour power has been compared to that of human capital, Marx himself may have considered a concept such as \\"human capital\\" to be a reification, the purpose of which was to imply that workers were a kind of capitalist. For instance, in Capital Vol. 2, Marx states: As commodity An advertisement for labour from Sabah and Sarawak, seen in Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur. Under capitalism, according to Marx, labour-power becomes a commodity - it is sold and bought on the market. A worker tries to sell his or her labour-power to an employer, in exchange for a wage or salary. If successful (the only alternative being unemployment), this exchange involves submitting to the authority of the capitalist for a specific period of time. During that time, the worker does actual labour, producing goods and services. The capitalist can then sell these and obtain surplus value; since the wages paid to the workers are lower than the value of the goods or services they produce for the capitalist. Labour power can also be sold by the worker on \\"own account\\", in which case he is self-employed, or it can be sold by an intermediary, such as a hiring agency. In principle a group of workers can also sell their labour- power as an independent contracting party. Some labour contracts are very complex, involving a number of different intermediaries. Normally, the worker is legally the owner of his labour power, and can sell it freely according to his own wishes. However, most often the trade in labour power is regulated by legislation, and the sale may not be truly \\"free\\"‚Äîit may be a forced sale for one reason or another, and indeed it may be bought and sold against the real wishes of the worker even although he owns his own labour power. Various gradations of freedom and unfreedom are possible, and free wage labour can combine with slave labour or semi-slavery. The concept of labour power as a commodity was first explicitly stated by Friedrich Engels in The Principles of Communism (1847): Value Labour power is a peculiar commodity, because it is an attribute of living persons, who own it themselves in their living bodies. Because they own it within themselves, they cannot permanently sell it to someone else; in that case, they would be a slave, and a slave does not own himself. Yet, although workers can hire themselves out, they cannot \\"hire out\\" or \\"lease\\" their labour, since they cannot reclaim or repossess the labour at some point after the work is done, in the same way as rental equipment is returned to the owner. Once labour has been expended, it is gone, and the only remaining issue is who benefits from the results, and by how much. Labour power can become a marketable object, sold for a specific period, only if the owners are constituted in law as legal subjects who are free to sell it, and can enter into labour contracts. Once actualised and consumed through working, the capacity to work is exhausted, and must be replenished and restored. In general, Marx argues that in capitalism the value of labour power (as distinct from fluctuating market prices for work effort) is equal to its normal or average (re-)production cost, i.e. the cost of meeting the established human needs which must be satisfied in order for the worker to turn up for work each day, fit to work. This involves goods and services representing a quantity of labour equal to necessary labour or the necessary product. It represents an average cost of living, an average living standard. The general concept of the \\"value of labour power\\" is necessary because both the conditions of the sale of labour power, and the conditions under which goods and services are purchased by the worker with money from a salary, can be affected by numerous circumstances. If, for example, the state imposes a tax on consumer goods and services (an indirect tax or consumption tax such as value-added tax or goods and services tax), then what the worker can buy with his wage-money is reduced. Or, if price inflation increases, then again the worker can buy less with his wage money. The point is that this can occur quite independently of how much a worker is actually paid. Therefore, the standard of living of a worker can rise or fall quite independently of how much he is paid‚Äîsimply because goods and services become more expensive or cheaper to buy, or because he is blocked from access to goods and services. Included in the value of labour power is both a physical component (the minimum physical requirements for a healthy worker) and a moral-historical component (the satisfaction of needs beyond the physical minimum which have become an established part of the lifestyle of the average worker). The value of labour power is thus a historical norm, which is the outcome of a combination of factors: productivity; the supply and demand for labour; the assertion of human needs; the costs of acquiring skills; state laws stipulating minimum or maximum wages, the balance of power between social classes, etc. Buying labour power usually becomes a commercially interesting proposition only if it can yield more value than it costs to buy, i.e. employing it yields a net positive return on capital invested. However, in Marx's theory, the value-creating function of labour power is not its only function; it also importantly conserves and transfers capital value. If labour is withdrawn from the workplace for any reason, typically the value of capital assets deteriorates; it takes a continual stream of work effort to maintain and preserve their value. When materials are used to make new products, part of the value of materials is also transferred to the new products. Consequently, labour power may be hired not \\"because it creates more value than it costs to buy\\", but simply because it conserves the value of a capital asset which, if this labour did not occur, would decline in value by an even greater amount than the labour cost involved in maintaining its value; or because it is a necessary expense which transfers the value of a capital asset from one owner to another. Marx regards such labour as \\"unproductive\\" in the sense that it creates no new net addition to total capital value, but it may be essential and indispensable labour, because without it a capital value would reduce or disappear. The larger the stock of assets which is neither an input nor an output to real production, and the wealthier society's elite becomes, the more labour is devoted only to maintaining the mass of capital assets rather than increasing its value. Wages Marx regards money-wages and salaries as the price of labour power (though workers can also be paid \\"in kind\\"), normally related to hours worked or output produced. That price may contingently be higher or lower than the value of labour power, depending on market forces of supply and demand, on skill monopolies, legal rules, the ability of negotiate, etc. Normally, unless government action prevents it, high unemployment will lower wages, and full employment will raise wages, in accordance with the laws of supply and demand. But wages can also be reduced through high price inflation and consumer taxes. Therefore, a distinction must always be drawn between nominal gross wages and real wages adjusted for tax and price inflation, and indirect tax imposts must be considered. The labour-costs of an employer are not the same as the real buying power a worker acquires through working. An employer usually also has to pay taxes & levies to the government in respect of workers hired, which may include social security contributions or superannuation benefits. In addition there are often also administrative costs. So, in the United States for example, out of the total expenditure on labour by employers, the workers get about 60% as take-home pay, but about 40% consists of taxes, benefits and ancillary costs. Employers may be able to claim back part of the surcharge on labour by means of various tax credits, or because the tax on business income is lowered. There is typically a constant conflict over the level of wages between employers and employees, since employers seek to limit or reduce wage-costs, while workers seek to increase their wages, or at least maintain them. How the level of wages develops depends on the demand for labour, the level of unemployment, and the ability of workers and employers to organise and take action with regard to pay claims. Marx regarded wages as the \\"external form\\" of the value of labour power. The compensation of workers in capitalist society could take all kinds of different forms, but there was always both a paid and unpaid component of labour performed. The \\"ideal\\" form of wages for capitalism, he argued, were piece wages because in that case the capitalist paid only for labour which directly created those outputs adding value to his capital. It was the most efficient form of exploitation of labour power. Consumption When labour power has been purchased and an employment contract signed, normally it is not yet paid for. First, labour power must be put to work in the production process. The employment contract is only a condition for uniting labour power with the means of production. From that point on, Marx argues, labour power at work is transformed into capital, specifically variable capital which accomplishes the valorisation process. Functioning as variable capital, living labour creates both use values and new value, conserves the value of constant capital assets, and transfers part of the value of materials and equipment used to the new products. The result aimed for is the valorisation of invested capital, i.e. other things being equal, the value of capital is maintained and has also increased through the activity of living labour. At the end of the working day, labour power has been more or less consumed, and must be restored through rest, eating and drinking, and recreation. Medical estimates of the average holiday time necessary for fulltime workers to fully recuperate in a physiological and psychological sense from work stress during the year differ from country to country; but as an approximate gauge, three weeks continuous holiday is physiologically optimal for the average worker. ILO statistics show a wide range of average hours worked and average holidays for different countries; for example, Korean workers work the most hours per year, and Americans have fewer formal holidays than West Europeans. Several researchers have questioned however to what extent additional hours worked really increase the marginal productivity of labour; particularly in services, the work that gets done in five days could often also be done in four. The most difficult aspect to measure is the intensity of work, though some argue the incidence of work accidents are a reliable yardstick. If workers are laid off by an organization, but the organization continues to produce the same amount of output or services as before, or even more, with the same technology, we can often conclude that the intensity of work must have increased. Reproduction Marx himself argued that: This understanding, however, only captures the sense in which the reproduction of labour power comes at no cost to capitalists, like the reproduction of ecological conditions, but unlike the reproduction of, say, machine bolts and plastic wrap. Elites and governments have always sought to actively intervene or mediate in the process of the reproduction of labour power, through family legislation, laws regulating sexual conduct, medical provisions, education policies, and housing policies. Such interventions always carry an economic cost, but that cost can be socialized or forced upon workers themselves, especially women. In these areas of civil society, there has been a constant battle between conservatives, social reformists and radicals. Marxist-Feminists have argued that in reality, household (domestic) labour by housewives which forms, maintains and restores the capacity to work is a large \\"free gift\\" to the capitalist economy. Time use surveys show that formally unpaid and voluntary labour is a very large part of the total hours worked in a society. Markets depend on that unpaid labour to function at all. Some feminists have therefore demanded that the government pay \\"wages for housework\\". This demand conflicts with the legal framework of the government in capitalist society, which usually assumes a financial responsibility only for the upkeep of \\"citizens\\" and \\"families\\" lacking other sources of income or subsistence. The role of the state The state can influence both the value and price of labour-power in numerous different ways, and normally it regulates wages and working conditions in the labour market to a greater or lesser extent. It can do so for example by: *Stipulating minimum and maximum wage rates for work. *Stipulating maximum and minimum working hours, and the retirement age. *Stipulating minimum requirements for working conditions, workplace health and safety issues and the like. *Stipulating requirements for labour contracts, trade union organization and wage bargaining. *Legally defining the civil rights and entitlements of the workers. *Adjusting direct and indirect tax rates, levies and tariffs for wage earners and employers in various ways. *Adjusting social insurance policies, pension charges/claims and the like. *Instituting and adjusting unemployment benefits and other social benefits. *Subsidizing workers or their employers in various ways through eligibility to various benefits or supplements to salary. *Influencing the general price level, by means of fiscal policy and monetary policy, or by instituting price controls for consumer goods and services. *Regulating the consumption of goods and services by workers. *Policing workers on the job and off-work, and prosecuting criminal activity with respect to workers' lives. *Requiring military service from young workers at fixed pay rates. *Creating additional jobs and employment by means of various policies, or, permitting unemployment to grow. *Encouraging or preventing labour mobility and job mobility. *Permitting or preventing the inflow of immigrant workers, or the emigration of workers. *Stipulating legal requirements relating to the accommodation, health, sex life, family situation and pregnancy of workers. Marx was very aware of this and in Das Kapital provides many illustrations, often taken from the Blue Books and factory inspector's reports. Part of the role of the state is to secure those general (collective) conditions for the reproduction and maintenance of workers which individuals and private enterprise cannot secure by themselves for one reason or another‚Äîfor example, because: *providing those conditions practically requires an authority which stands above competing interests. *meeting the conditions is too costly for private agencies, requiring investment funds not available to them. *it is technically not possible to privatize those conditions. *the conditions that have to be supplied are not sufficiently profitable, or too risky for private agencies. *there is a specific political or moral reason why the state should intervene. However, Marx did not provide a general theory of the state and the labour market. He intended to write a separate book on the subject of wages and the labour market (see Capital Vol. 1, Penguin edition, p. 683), but did not accomplish it, mainly because of bad health. Nevertheless, Marx made quite clear his belief that capitalism \\"overturns all the legal or traditional barriers that would prevent it from buying this or that kind of labour-power as it sees fit, or from appropriating this or that kind of labour\\" (Ibid., p. 1013). It is possible‚Äîapart from bad health‚Äîthat he did not write a general critique of the state, because he lived himself as an exile in Britain, and therefore, he might have got into major trouble personally, if he had criticized the state publicly in his writings in ways not acceptable to the British state. In modern times, the fact that the state has a big effect on wages and the value of labour power has given rise to the concepts of the social wage and collective consumption. If the state claims just as much money from workers through taxes and levies as it pays out to them, then it is of course doubtful whether the state really \\"pays a social wage\\". However, more often the state redistributes income from one group or workers to another, reducing the income of some and increasing that of others. Quotation by Marx on the value of labour power and classical political economy Labour market flexibilisation The commercial value of human labour power is strongly linked to the assertion of human needs by workers as citizens. It is not simply a question of supply and demand here, but of human needs which must be met. Therefore, labour costs have never been simply an \\"economic\\" or \\"commercial\\" matter, but also a moral, cultural and political issue. In turn, this has meant that governments have typically strongly regulated the sale of labour power with laws and rules for labour contracts. These laws and rules affect e.g. the minimum wage, wage bargaining, the operation of trade unions, the obligations of employers in respect of employees, hiring and firing procedures, labour taxes, and unemployment benefits. This has led to repeated criticism from employers that labour markets are over-regulated, and that the costs and obligations of hiring labour weigh too heavily on employers. Moreover, it is argued that over-regulation prevents the free movement of labour to where it is really necessary. If labour markets were deregulated by removing excessive legal restrictions, it is argued that costs to business would be reduced and more labour could be hired, thereby increasing employment opportunities and economic growth. However, trade union representatives often argue that the real effect of deregulation is to reduce wages and conditions for workers, with the effect of reducing market demand for products. In turn, the effect would be lower economic growth and a decline in living standards, with increased casualisation of labour and more \\"contingent labour\\". It is argued that, because the positions of employees and employers in the market are unequal (it is usually easier for an employer to loose an employee than an employee to loose an employer), employees must be legally protected against undue exploitation. Otherwise employers will simply hire workers as and when it suits them, without regard for their needs as citizens. A further twist in some countries is that unions are part of the political establishment, and not interested in collecting complaints and suggestions from individual employees, employing staff in proportion to dues received, backing employees' legal cases, or rocking the boat in their public statements. For example, in China some workers are in prison for criticising the official unions. Often the demand for \\"labour market flexibility\\" is combined with the demand for strong immigration controls, to block any movement of labour which would be only a burden for capital accumulation. The term \\"flexibility\\" is used because, while capital must be able to move freely around the globe, the movement of labour must be strictly controlled. If that control does not exist, it is argued, it could mean additional costs to employers and taxpayers. Criticism It has been argued by Ian Steedman that Marx's own concept of labour power was in truth very similar to that of David Ricardo and Adam Smith and, therefore, that Marx was not saying anything really new. However, Marx's interpretation is (as he himself said) different from the \\"natural price of labour\\" of the classical political economists, because the \\"free play of market forces\\" does not gravitate spontaneously and automatically toward the \\"natural price\\" (the value) of labour power. Precisely because labour power is a unique and peculiar commodity, being lodged in the living worker, it does not conform to all the same laws as other kinds of commodities. Depending on social conditions, labour power may durably trade at prices well above, or below, its real value. Marx only assumed that labour power traded at its value, in order to show that even if that was the case, the worker was still economically exploited. But he was well aware that often labour power did not trade at its value, either because of unfavourable wage-bargaining conditions or because of labour scarcity. A recent criticism by Prof. Marcel van der Linden is as follows: \\"Marx's thesis is based on two dubious assumptions, namely that labour needs to be offered for sale by the person who is the actual bearer and owner of such labour, and that the person who sells the labour sells nothing else. Why does this have to be the case? Why can labour not be sold by a party other than the bearer? What prevents the person who provides labour (his or her own or that of somebody else) from offering packages combining the labour with labour means? And why can a slave not perform wage labour for his master at the estate of some third party?\\" This difficulty was first noted in research conducted during the 1980s by Tom Brass, gathered together in his 1999 book. The buying and selling of human work effort can and has taken many more different forms than Marx acknowledges‚Äîespecially in the area of services. A modern information society makes possible all kinds of new forms of hustling.Caneisha Mills, \\"Hustling and the problems of daily life: individual or collective solutions?\\". Liberation School, 2 July 2012. Marx said himself that \\"Above all [capitalism] overturns all the legal or traditional barriers that would prevent it from buying this or that kind of labour-power as it sees fit, or from appropriating this or that kind of labour\\".Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Pelican edition 1976, p. 1013). The concept of the value of labour power referred to the underlying economic relationship, not to be confused with the formalities of all the kinds of labour contracts which are possible.

Early years Lester Lowry Mays was born on July 24, 1935 in Harris County, Texas, United States to Lester T. Mays and Mary Virginia Lowry. Mays attended the A&M; College of Texas (now Texas A&M; University), where he received a B.S. in petroleum engineering. After his 1957 graduation from Texas A&M;, Mays joined the Air Force, where he served as an officer. Upon his discharge from the Air Force, Mays earned an MBA from Harvard University. He became an investment banker, rising to Vice President of Corporate Finance during his ten years at Russ & Company. Clear Channel Communications In 1972, Mays founded the San Antonio Broadcasting Company, which became Clear Channel Communications. The company purchased its first radio station, KEEZ-FM in San Antonio in 1972. He and his business partner Red McCombs bought a second San Antonio Station, WOAI, in 1975. This station was considered a \\"clear channel\\" station because no other station operated on its frequency and its 50,000-watt signal could be heard hundreds or even thousands of miles away on a clear night. Over the next several years, the company bought ten more struggling radio stations and turned them profitable, usually by switching their formats to religious or talk programming. Their first non- San Antonio acquisition was 1250 KPAC and 98.5 KPAC-FM in Port Arthur, bought from the then Port Arthur College, now Lamar-Port Arthur. KPAC-FM was upgraded by Clear Channel in the early 1980s to be their first \\"Houston\\" station when the company built a 2,000-ft tower near Devers, Texas, hoping to cover Houston. The effort failed to meet expectations and the station was sold after Clear Channel bought radio stations with in-town Houston signals. The company went public in 1984. In 1988, the company bought its first television station. By the mid-90s, Clear Channel Communications owned 43 radio and 16 television stations. After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 significantly deregulated the broadcast industry, Mays and his company purchased 49 radio stations and an interest in New Zealand's largest radio group. A merger with Jacor Communications, based in Covington, Kentucky (who had bought the former broadcast side of Nationwide Insurance a year earlier), brought the operation of 450 stations to the Clear Channel portfolio. Within eight years, and with an influx of capital investment from the private-equity Griffith Family, Clear Channel had accumulated ownership of over 1,200 radio stations and 41 television stations in the United States, one of the nation's leading live entertainment companies, and over 750,000 outdoor advertising displays. In 2003, Mays testified before the US Senate that the deregulation of the telecommunications industry had not hurt the public. However, in an interview that same year with Fortune Magazine, he remarked, \\"We're not in the business of providing news and information. We're not in the business of providing well-researched music. We're simply in the business of selling our customers products.\\" Mays was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2004. After suffering a stroke in 2005, Mays relinquished his position as a CEO of the company to his son, Mark Mays. Texas A&M; University Mays served on the Texas A&M; Board of Regents from 1985-1991. He was reappointed to the Board of Regents in 2001 and served as Chairman of the Board of Regents from 2003 - 2005. He was also a chair of the Presidential Library Committee and a member of the Committee on Buildings and Physical Plant and is the Board's special liaison to the Texas A&M; Foundation. His latest term on the Board of Regents expired on February 1, 2007. Mays has donated a substantial amount of money to the school to improve the business department. In 1996, A&M; rewarded him by renaming their business school, now Mays Business School, in his honor. Personal life Mays has served as a chairman of the United Way of San Antonio. He was a member of the Associates Board at Harvard Business School. He was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame in 1999. Mays and his wife, Peggy, have four children, Kathy Mays Johnson, Mark Mays, Linda Mays McCaul, and Randall Mays, along with sixteen grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. They live in San Antonio, Texas, where they oversee the operations and giving of the Mays Family Foundation.

Cape Town : Friends of the South African Library Both his father and grandfather had served in the Russian military as officers in the elite Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment. Golovnin appeared set to continue the family tradition, but his father died while he was still a child, and at the age of twelve he was enrolled in the Russian Naval College as a cadet. He graduated four years later in 1792. Golovnin entered active service as a midshipman in May and June 1790, participating in several naval battles against the Swedes.V N Berkh, V M Golovnin, Alaska Historical Society, Sitka Historical Society, Alaska Historical Commission.

M. Johnston (1979). Captain James Cook and His Times, p. 124. Vancouver, BC: Douglas & McIntyre He served three years (1802‚Äì1805) with the British fleet under Admirals Nelson, Collingwood, and Cornwallis. During this period, war was once again declared between the British and French, and Golovnin saw action while serving under Admiral Nelson.Cynthia H. Whittaker, E. Kasinec, Robert H. Davis (2003). Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825, p. 113 Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press He returned to Russia in 1806, and began compiling a code of naval signals on the English pattern, which remained in use by the Russian fleet for more than twenty years. Dianas voyage Japanese illustration of the sloop Diana Golovnin was given command of the sloop Diana in 1806, and made his first voyage around the world (1807‚Äî1809), with the object of conducting a survey of the northern Pacific, and transporting supplies to Okhotsk.Stephan, John J. (1994). The Russian Far East p. 37 Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press Diana set sail from Kronstadt on 7 July 1807. A severe storm in April 1808 prevented Diana from sailing around Cape Horn, and Golovnin decided to set sail for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to restock the ship's supplies. He anchored in the nearby port of Simon's Town on 3 May 1808. Golovnin, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Russian relations with Britain had deteriorated, and Russia had allied herself with the French. Diana was immediately detained as an enemy vessel by a British naval squadron, pending receipt of appropriate instructions from London. Golovnin and his crew spent more than a year detained aboard Diana at Simon's Town awaiting a decision from British authorities. When it became increasingly clear that a decision might never come, Golovnin began to plot their escape. On 28 May 1809, perfect conditions presented themselves - a fair wind and poor visibility. The crew severed the anchor cables, and managed successfully to sail out of the bay, passing directly in front of several British warships.Erickson, David. \\"Simon's Town Ceremony to Commemorate Escape of the Diana.\\" Ports and Ships Maritime News\\", 27 May 2009. Accessed 28 January 2010. http://ports.co.za/news/article_2009_05_27_1909.html Once the British discovered that they had escaped, they set off in pursuit, but failed to overtake Diana, which sailed safely to Kamchatka in 1810, and news of Dianas \\"audacious escape\\" quickly spread throughout the world. Golovnin left Kamchatka in 1810, sailing to Baranof Island, a recently settled outpost of the Russian-American Company. In 1819, he published an account of their voyage, detention and escape, titled Journey of the Russian Emperor‚Äôs sloop Diana from Kronstadt to Kamchatka. Captivity in Japan Vasily Golovnin taken prisoner In 1811, Golovnin described and mapped the Kuril Islands from the Strait of Hope to the eastern shores of Iturup Island (Etorofu in Japanese).Rimer, J. Thomas (1995). A Hidden Fire: Russian and Japanese Cultural Encounters, 1868-1926, p.3 Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press While exploring Kunashir Island (Kunashiri in Japanese), he was lured ashore, taken prisoner, charged with violating Sakoku (a Japanese policy prohibiting foreigners from entering Japan), and held captive for two years by the Japanese on the island of Hokkaido. Golovnin was said to possess a \\"superior education and fascination with foreign cultures.\\" After making one failed attempt to escape his captures, Golovnin decided to utilize his time in detainment to master the Japanese language, and familiarize himself with Japanese culture and traditions. Golovnin was released in 1813, returned to Russia, and published an account of his years in captivity. His book, Captivity in Japan During the Years 1811, 1812, 1813, became an instant classic. It was hailed in Russia as an authoritative volume on Japanese culture, and helped shape an entire generation's view of Japan. Golovnin clearly respected the Japanese, portraying them \\"as intelligent, as patriotic, and as worthy rivals\\" of the Russians in the Pacific. His representation of Japanese religious practices also became influential in Europe; he claimed that the Japanese practiced a form of Hinduism or Indian religion but a minority followed a distant, indigenous form of Christianity, influencing later scholars' claims about Japanese religion well into the 19th century. The captivity of Golovnin almost led to war between Russia and Japan in what became known as the Golovnin Incident. Around the world on the Kamchatka On 7 September 1817, Golovnin set out on a second voyage around the world aboard the frigate Kamchatka. Serving under him were three future Russian explorers of prominence - Fyodor Litke, Fyodor Matyushkin, and Ferdinand von Wrangel. After sailing around Cape Horn, the objective was to deliver supplies to Kamchatka, and survey previously unexplored islands along what is now the northwestern coast of Alaska. Golovnin was also tasked with compiling a report detailing relations between the Kodiak Islanders and employees of the Russian- American Company. He arrived in Kamchatka the following May, then returned to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope, completing his circumnavigation by landing at St Petersburg on 17 September 1819. After the journey, Golovnin published Around the World on the Kamchatka, describing his voyage, and his encounters with the native Kodiak and Sandwich Islanders. Though the journey had \\"achieved little in the way of new discoveries,\\" Golovnin returned with \\"a vast store of scientific and astronomical information\\" to share with Russian scientists. Later career and death In 1821, Golovnin was appointed assistant director of the Russian Naval College, and later, in 1823, General Quartermaster of the Fleet. A talented administrator, Golovnin successfully managed the activities of the shipbuilding, commissariat, and artillery departments. Under his supervision, over two hundred ships were built, including the first Russian steamships. Golovnin also served as a mentor to numerous Russian navigators, including the aforementioned Fyodor Litke and Ferdinand von Wrangel. Golovnin died of cholera during an epidemic that swept through the city of Saint Petersburg in 1831.Novikov, Nikolai (1945). Russian Voyages Around the World, p. 98. New York: Hutchinson Legacy and honors Golovnin in a Russian postage stamp Golovnin was awarded many honors during his life, including the Order of St. Vladimir and the Order of Saint George, serving as commander of the latter. According to one historian, his literary works detailing his adventures at sea and on shore remain notable due to his \\"respect for historical detail...[his] critical ability, literary skill, and lively curiosity.\\" A complete edition was published at St Petersburg in five volumes in 1864, with maps and charts, and a biography of the author. The village of Golovin, Alaska, Cape Golovnin, as well as Golovnin Bay and Golovnin Lagoon, are all named in honor of Vasily Golovnin. A strait between two of the Kuril Islands, Golovnin volcano on Kunashir Island, capes on Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land, are among other landmarks bearing his name. The cape of Point Hope in Alaska was also originally named in Golovnin's honor. Family Golovnin married the daughter of a Tver landowner and retired army officer, Evdokiya Stepanovna Lutkovskaya (1795‚Äì1884). All four of Evdokiya's brothers served in the Russian Navy; two of them, Peter and Feopemt Lutkovsky, became Admirals, and rose to great prominence.Aleksandr Ivanovich Alekseev, Katherine L. Arndt, Trans. (1996) Fedor Petrovich Litke, p. 152 Anchorage: University of Alaska Press Admiral Feopemt Lutkovsky (1803‚Äì1852) served under Golovnin during his voyage aboard the Kamchatka (1817‚Äì1819). Feopemt was described as \\"free thinking\\", and according to testimony given by individuals involved in the Decembrist Uprising, he was in close communication with several members of their society. He avoided prosecution for treason due to the intervention of Fyodor Litke. Evdokiya's sister Ekaterina also married a naval officer, Rear Admiral Maksim Maksimovich Genning. Golovnin's son, Alexander Vasilyevich Golovnin (1821‚Äì1886), initially followed in his father's footsteps, serving in the Russian Navy. A close friend and associate of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich, Alexander retired from the Navy, and served as Minister of Education (1861‚Äì1866) under Tsar Alexander II.Radzinsky, Edvard.

Early life Born in Ealing, Middlesex, Jackson was adopted as a one-week-old baby by Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gunter. The Gunters also adopted Geoffrey Oliver Hartley, who would himself be awarded the George Medal as a Federation of Malaya police lieutenant for protecting his party, which included three children, from bandits in 1951.Newspaper reports, including Jackson's obituary in the Daily Telegraph say that Hartley won the George Cross, but the London Gazette, which is the authoritative historical record for British awards, lists his award as the lesser George Medal. Upon this occasion, Mrs. Gunter said, \\"We adopted two of the finest sons any parents could wish for.\\" Jackson qualified as a fitter and turner. Although he was married and in a reserved occupation at the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted in the RAF. Military career He joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1939 and originally served as a Classified Fitter IIE (engines). In January 1941, he was assigned to a Sunderland flying boat squadron based in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He applied for retraining as a flight engineer and returned to England in September 1942. On 28 July 1943, he joined No. 106 Squadron which operated Avro Lancaster bombers. Jackson completed his tour of 30 missions on 24 April 1944, but, as he had flown one sortie with a different crew, he chose to fly once more so that he and his original aircrew could finish their tour together. Jackson's 31st mission was a raid on the German ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt on the night of 26‚Äì27 April. Having bombed the target, Jackson's Lancaster (serial ME669) was attacked by a German night fighter and a fuel tank in the starboard wing caught fire. Jackson, already wounded from shell splinters, strapped on a parachute and equipped himself with a fire extinguisher before climbing out of the aircraft and onto the wing, whilst the aeroplane was flying at , in order to put out the fire. He gripped the air intake on the leading edge of the wing with one hand, and fought the fire with the other. The flames seared his hands, face, and clothes. The fighter returned and hit the bomber with a burst of gunfire that sent two bullets into his legs. The burst also swept him off the wing. He fell , but his smouldering and holed parachute worked well enough to save his life. He suffered further injuries upon landing, including a broken ankle, but managed to crawl to a nearby German village the next morning, where he was paraded through the street. He spent 10 months recovering in hospital before being transferred to the Stalag IX-C prisoner-of-war camp. He made two escape attempts, the second of which was successful as he made contact with a unit of the US Third Army. Jackson's exploit became known when the surviving crewmen of his bomber were released from German captivity at the end of the war. He was promoted to warrant officer and his Victoria Cross (VC) award was gazetted on 26 October 1945. When he went to Buckingham Palace to receive his VC from King George VI, he was accompanied by Leonard Cheshire who was also due to receive his on that day. Group Captain Cheshire insisted that, despite the difference in rank, they should approach the King together. Jackson remembers that Cheshire said to the King, \\"This chap stuck his neck out more than I did ‚Äì he should get his VC first! Of course the King had to keep to protocol but I will never forget what Cheshire said.\\" =Victoria Cross citation= Extract from Fourth Supplement, The London Gazette No 37324 of Friday 26 October 1945: Postwar and personal life After the war, he worked as a travelling salesman of Haig whisky. He and his wife Alma had seven children. Jackson died on 26 March 1994 at Hampton Hill, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, and is buried in Twickenham Cemetery. Legacy The Norman Jackson Centre in Hampton Hill was named after him In April 2004, Jackson's VC medal was sold at auction to Lord Ashcroft for ¬£235,250 (GBP) against a pre-auction estimate of ¬£130,000.http://www.spink.com/departments/medals.asp His family were upset because the medal went to a private bidder rather than the RAF museum at Hendon. They had planned to give their father's medals to the museum, but found they could not do so under the terms of their mother's will and the museum was outbid. His VC is now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London. Norman Jackson's son appeared in the episode on his father's crew in Lord Ashcroft's documentary series Heroes of the Skies (broadcast on Channel Five on 4 October 2012), as well as the Discovery Channel's Air Aces (premiering October 2013).

Also in Persian and in some Arab states, certain soldier classes were also called candar. They were especially assigned to guard palaces and the heads of state. In the Great Seljuq Empire, the candar corps consisted of specially trained Turkish and foreign slaves. The head of the candar corps was called Emir-i Candar and he was included in the governing body. After the breakup of the empire, some members of this corps went to the Turkoman beyliks in Anatolia, Shiraz, Khorasan, and through the Mamluks to Yemen and Maghreb states to take up being palace guards. In Anatolian Seljuqs (Sultanate of R√ªm), candars guarded the palace and the head of state and his headquarters, together with the Hassa soldiers. They were cavalrymen, and they would use swords, bows and carry shields. One of these candars who actually was in the Seljuq court, Demir Yaman Candar, founded his own Jandarid principality, near Kastamonu, Turkey. In the Mamluk palace, the candar corps was as large as a regiment, and was divided into smaller units called nevbe. They had wider authorities and responsibilities, such as accompanying those who would enter the court, accompanying the monarch himself at campaigns to protect him, performing arrests and executions, as well as guarding the prison allocated to political insurgents. The Ottoman Turks did not have candars at their courts; instead they had set up a different institution to take up their position.

Biography  Moffett was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he attended I.M. Terrell High School with Ornette Coleman. Before switching to drums, Moffett began his musical career as a trumpeter. At age 13, he played trumpet with Jimmy Witherspoon, and later formed a band, the Jam Jivers, with fellow students Coleman and Prince Lasha. After switching to drums, Moffett briefly performed with Little Richard. Moffett served in the United States Navy, after which he pursued boxing before studying music at Huston-Tillotson College in Austin. Moffett married in 1953 (Coleman was best man, and performed at the wedding), then began teaching music at a public school in Rosenberg, Texas In 1961, Moffett moved to New York City to work with Ornette Coleman, but the saxophonist soon went into a brief retirement period. Moffett worked with Sonny Rollins, appeared on Archie Shepp's album Four for Trane, and led a group that included Pharoah Sanders and Carla Bley. When Coleman returned to performing in 1964, he formed a trio with Moffett and bassist David Izenzon. Moffett also performed on vibraphone. Moffett began teaching music at New York Public Schools as a way to make ends meet when Coleman made only sporadic performances. Moffett taught at P.S. 58 (Carrol School) in Brooklyn and at P.S. 177 M (under the Manhattan Bridge and now defunct). He also taught at a Brooklyn High School. Moffett moved to Oakland, California, where he served as the city's music director, and was later the principal of the alternative Odyssey public school in Berkeley in the mid-1970s. The title of his first solo album The Gift is a reference to his love of teaching music. His then 7-year-old son Codaryl played drums on that album. Moffett later returned to Brooklyn, NY and taught at P.S. 142 Stranahan Junior High School (Closed in 2006) and at P.S. 58 Carroll School.

Research Niven completed the solution of most of Waring's problem in 1944. This problem, based on a 1770 conjecture by Edward Waring, consists of finding the smallest number g(n) such that every positive integer is the sum of at most g(n) nth powers of positive integers. David Hilbert had proved the existence of such a g(n) in 1909; Niven's work established the value of g(n) for all but finitely many values of n.

The unmanned Atlas V rocket launched the two space probes towards the Moon, where they will provide a 3-D map and search for water in conjunction with the Hubble Space Telescope. The launch date, originally planned for October 2008, was shifted to Thursday from Wednesday (June 17) due to a postponement of the Saturday (June 13) launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, resulting from a hydrogen fuel leak. This lunar program marked the first United States mission to the Moon in over ten years. Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon occurred July 20, 1969, and this launch was just 32 days shy of the 40th anniversary. The actual journey to the Moon took about four days, at which time the LRO entered a low orbit around the Moon, while the LCROSS mission performed a \\"swing-by\\" to enter a much different orbit to set up for a collision with the Moon's surface several months later.

The plume from the Centaur impact was predicted to be visible through telescopes with apertures as small as 10 to .  Program history  The Atlas V-Centaur rocket carrying the LRO and LCROSS just after take off. Initially, the LPRP program was a part of the Science Mission Directorate of NASA (SMD) and was called the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP). Management of the RLEP program was assigned to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in February, 2004. At that time, the Program's goal was to \\"...initiate a series of robotic missions to the Moon to prepare for and support future human exploration activities.\\" In 2005, responsibility for RLEP was moved to NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and management assigned to the Ames Research Center (ARC). In 2006, the program was renamed to the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program and management responsibility reassigned to the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The US$583 million space mission comes equipped with a $504 million state of the art LRO space probe and a $79 million LCROSS satellite. = LRO = The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is the first mission of the LPRP program. Management of LRO was assigned to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in 2004. LRO launched on an Atlas V 401 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on June 18, 2009 at 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT). The planned lift off for 5:12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT) was slightly delayed by 20 minutes due to thunderstorms. It will orbit the Moon for one year, gathering high resolution images of the lunar surface that will allow the creation of detailed maps. LRO's goals include finding safe landing sites for human visits to the Moon, identifying lunar resources, and studying the lunar radiation environment. The LRO will provide a 3-D map of the Moon's surface to allow astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020. On board the LRO are seven instruments, the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND), Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), and Miniature Radio Frequency radar (Mini-RF). = LCROSS = The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission is co-manifested with LRO. It was selected as a secondary payload in 2006, and management of the program was assigned to Ames Research Center (ARC). The mission will explore a permanently shadowed region of a lunar pole by crashing the spent Centaur rocket upper stage of the Atlas V launch vehicle into a dark crater. The composition of the ejecta plume will be observed by a shepherding spacecraft, which will itself crash-land 4 minutes later, creating a second plume. NASA expects the impact velocity will be over 9,000 km/h (5,600 mph). The ejecta plume will be in the order of 350 tons (317 metric tons) and rise from the surface. =LADEE= The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in on September 7, 2013. studied the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity.

World War II  Hazelwood was laid down 11 April 1942 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., San Francisco, California; launched 20 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harold J. Fosdick; and commissioned 18 June 1943, Commander Hunter Wood, Jr., in command. After shakedown, Hazelwood departed the West Coast 5 September. Reaching Pearl Harbor 9 September, she sailed 2 days later with a fast carrier strike force under Rear Admiral C. A. Pownall in Lexington to launch carrier-based air strikes against Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. Hazelwood next joined a second fast carrier force--6 carriers, 7 cruisers, and 24 destroyers under Rear Admiral A. E. Montgomery--for strikes against Wake Island 5 October and 6 October. Returning to Pearl Harbor 11 October, the destroyer took part in intensive training to prepare for the giant amphibious drive to Japan. She joined Task Force 53 under Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance at Havannah Harbor, New Hebrides, 5 November. Departing 13 November, she took part in invasion of the Gilbert Islands 20 November. In one of the bitterest struggles during the fleet's push across the Pacific, she served on antisubmarine patrol and as standby fighter-director ship. Hazelwood returned to Pearl Harbor 7 December 1943 to prepare for the next operation. As the war in the Pacific gained momentum, Hazelwood sortied from Pearl Harbor 22 January 1944 as part of Task Force 52 under Admiral Spruance for the invasion of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls in the Marshall Islands. After troops stormed ashore 31 January, she anchored in Kwajalein Harbor as primary fighter- director ship and also patrolled against enemy submarines. This objective secured, she departed Kwajalein 15 February for several months of patrol and escort duty through the Solomons and Marshalls. She also bombarded Japanese shore positions at Ungalabu Harbor and a tank farm on New Ireland. Hazelwood next participated in the invasion of the Palaus. As the 1st Marine Division landed on Peleliu, Palau Islands, 15 September, she pounded enemy shore positions with gunfire to lessen Japanese opposition. She remained off Peleliu on patrol until 3 October, when she sailed to Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island. There the never-resting veteran joined Vice Admiral Kinkaid's naval forces for the invasion and liberation of the Philippines. As troops landed under naval cover on Leyte 20 October, Hazelwood came under heavy Japanese air attacks. The next week brought constant enemy air raids and a succession of far reaching fleet moves as the Imperial Navy made one final but futile effort to drive America out of the Philippines and regain some measure of control over the seas. In this struggle, known to history as the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese Navy was all but annihilated. Three enemy battleships, four carriers, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, nine destroyers, and a host of planes were destroyed. Hazelwood herself accounted for at least two kamikazes destroyed. Hazelwood engaged in patrols off Leyte Gulf and gunnery and training exercises out of Ulithi during December. She then joined Vice Admiral McCain's fast carrier strike force and sailed 30 December. Carrying the war home to the enemy, the carriers launched heavy air raids against Japanese positions in the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Okinawa, and along the China coast 3-7 January 1945. These devastating strikes also diverted Japanese attention from the Philippines, where landings were made at Lingayen Gulf 9 January. After further strikes on Japanese positions in Indochina, the hard-hitting force returned to Ulithi 26 January. Joining another fast and mobile carrier task force, Hazelwood sortied 11 February to protect carriers as they launched heavy air strikes against the Japanese home islands 16 and 17 February. Swiftly shifting positions as only sea-based power can, the fleet then sped south to provide support for the landings on Iwo Jima, begun 19 February. Although under constant attack from kamikazes as well as fighters and dive- bombers, Hazelwood came through the invasion untouched and on the night of 25 February sank two small enemy freighters with her guns. Returning to Ulithi 1 March, the battle-tried destroyer sailed again for action 14 March with a fast carrier force to provide air cover and shore bombardment for the invasion of Okinawa, last step before invasion of the Japanese home islands. After the invasion 1 April, Hazelwood operated off Okinawa on radar picket and escort patrols through intense Japanese air attacks. On 29 April, the carrier group she was shepherding was attacked by kamikazes who dove out of low cloud cover. Hazelwood after the Kamikaze hit off Okinawa. Hazelwood, all guns blazing, maneuvered to avoid two of the Zeros. A third screamed out of the clouds from astern. Although hit by Hazelwood‚Äôs fire, the enemy plane careened past the superstructure. It hit #2 stack on the port side, smashed into the bridge, and exploded. Flaming gasoline spilled over the decks and bulkheads as the mast toppled and the forward guns were put out of action. Ten officers and 67 men were killed, including the Commanding Officer, Cmdr. V. P. Douw, and 36 were missing. Hazelwood‚Äôs engineering officer, Lt. (j.g.) C. M. Locke, took command and directed her crew in fighting the damage and aiding wounded. Proceeding by tow and part way under her own power, the gallant ship reached Ulithi 5 May for temporary repairs, then sailed to Mare Island Naval Shipyard via Pearl Harbor 14 June for permanent repairs. Hazelwood decommissioned 18 January 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. Post War service Hazelwood in 1960, fitted with the experimental flight deck. Hazelwood recommissioned at San Diego 12 September 1951, Cmdr. R. M. Niles in command, to participate in the Korean War. After shakedown she departed San Diego 4 January 1952, and reached Newport, Rhode Island, 21 January to join Destroyer Forces, Atlantic Fleet. Operations and exercises along the East Coast and in the Caribbean, as well as hunter-killer training with carrier groups, occupied Hazelwood until she departed Newport for the Far East 7 December 1953. She reached Tokyo 12 January 1954, via Pearl Harbor and spent the next few months operating with a fast carrier task force and patrolling along the Korean coast to enforce an uneasy armistice. The far-ranging destroyer returned to the States the long way, departing Hong Kong 28 May 1954 and sailing through the Suez Canal to reach Newport 17 July. During the next few years, Hazelwood maintained a pattern of training and readiness operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean interspersed with deployments to the Mediterranean. During the Suez Crisis in the fall of 1956 she served with the mighty 6th Fleet, patrolling the eastern Mediterranean and helping to stabilize a tense international situation. A DASH-drone over Hazelwood¬¥s flight deck. In 1958, Hazelwood began extensive testing of helicopters for antisubmarine warfare both in Narragansett Bay and out of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Maryland. Assigned to the Destroyer Development Division, she participated in tests on equipment used with radar and electronic counter- measure systems. Her primary research and development work involved the testing of the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH). Hazelwood provided on board testing facilities, and helped make possible the perfection of DASH, an advanced and vital ASW weapons system. In August 1963 alone, the drone helicopter made 1,000 landings on the versatile destroyer's flight deck. In addition to experimental developments, Hazelwood continued to engage in the many duties assigned to a destroyer. As America confronted Russia over the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba in October 1962, she steamed again to the troubled Caribbean for antisubmarine and surveillance patrols. Hazelwood arrived Guantanamo Naval Base 5 November, just after the quarantine of Cuba had gone into effect and remained on guard during the crisis, serving as a Gun Fire Support Ship for Task Force 84. When the nuclear submarine Thresher failed to surface 10 April 1963, Hazelwood immediately deployed to the scene of the tragedy with scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to begin a systematic search for the missing ship. Hazelwood resumed testing of DASH during June and later in the year conducted on board trials of the Shipboard Landing Assist Device (SLAD). She continued both developmental and tactical operations along the East Coast during the next year. She decommissioned 19 March 1965, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Hazelwood was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974 and sold 14 April 1976. Honors Hazelwood received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

Several of its candidates were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and it counted federal Members of Parliament J. S. Woodsworth and A. A. Heaps among its members. The ILP was founded in December 1920 by disgruntled members of the Dominion Labour Party, who left that organization when it was taken over by rightist elements. Like the DLP, the ILP was a reformist labour group, and often had hostile relations with parties further to the left. In the provincial election of 1920, the combined efforts of reformist labourites and socialists resulted in eleven leftists being elected to the Manitoba legislature. Most of these Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), including parliamentary leader Fred Dixon, were part of the exodus from the DLP to the ILP later in the year. The ILP fell to six seats in the election of 1922, and Dixon resigned from the legislature in 1923 following a family tragedy. He was replaced as party leader by John Queen, formerly of the Social Democratic Party of Canada. Support for left- wing and labour parties declined throughout Canada in the late 1920s. Queen led the ILP through the elections of 1927 and 1932, winning three and five seats respectively. He was replaced by Seymour Farmer in 1935. The ILP never affiliated with the Canadian Labour Party. Initially, this was because the rightist DLP leadership had affiliated itself with the CLP soon after the exodus of ILP members. There were attempts at a compromise, but divisions between DLP and ILP members were too strong to overcome and the ILP refused to join the \\"national\\" organization as such. Later, the ILP would remain out of the CLP due to the large number of communists who joined the latter group in the 1920s. (The CLP was, in any case, a fairly weak organization in Manitoba, and the ILP leaders had little incentive to merge with their smaller rival.) The ILP had a complicated relationship with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s. The CCF was formed to expand the parliamentary left's support base beyond the urban working class, and many in the ILP were suspicious of this. The parties nevertheless became aligned in 1933, at a time when the CCF organization in the province was weak. In three years, the CCF had developed its own identity and was less willing to support the ILP's demands for autonomy. The party was referred to as \\"ILP-CCF\\" during the provincial election of 1936, against the opposition of some traditional ILP supporters. Following the election (in which the party won seven seats), a group of disgruntled ILP members succeeded in temporarily disaffiliating the parties. Pressure from David Lewis and J. S. Woodsworth brought about a realignment, but the ILP's relationship with the CCF remained shakey until the early 1940s, when CCF loyalists took over the ILP's internal organization. These divisions were especially noticeable at the start of the Second World War: the ILP supported an all-out war effort, whereas the CCF favoured conscription of \\"wealth before men\\". The ILP organization officially disbanded in 1943. It had been superseded by the CCF some time earlier.

It was localized in Europe by Otaku Publishing and distributed in North America by JAST USA in January 1999. Gameplay Unlike traditional, even modern visual novels, which are characteristically uninvolved beyond the periodic decision to make, True Love incorporates elements reminiscent of a role-playing game, for which it is also occasionally categorized. The game is played through a series of virtual days, consecutively spanning three months. At the start of each morning, players designate an activity to pursue for evening, night, and in the case of weekends or vacation, daytime: studying, practicing art, exercising, grooming, recreation, taking a break, going to work, shopping or fulfilling a promise. Each choice affects the overall being of the player at the conclusion of the day, and points are distributed among stats for passion, appearance, fatigue, scholarship, strength and art. Depending on the level of these stats, and the order of schedules made during particular days, the player will shift their romantic focus and possibly trigger nonlinear events and encounters over time. In addition, working generates income and shopping allows the player to voluntarily spend their money on items for themselves or to give as gifts. Plot The main character is a single, nineteen-year-old Japanese college senior living in the fictional city of Meiai, forced out by his parents at the idea that independence may attract him a partner. On top of his quest to find a girlfriend, he is also indecisive about what direction to go in his academics. The player can choose any name for the character (the default name is Daisuke). Characters ;Mikae Morikawa :The player's childhood friend who met him in kindergarten; now an adolescent co-ed attending the same college as him with a less than platonic eye. Although she can be meddlesome, Mikae is the most down-to-earth, well-rounded of girls to court with no overall preferences. ;Kazuhiko Miyoshi :The player's closest if not best friend. He enjoys video games and is quite knowledgeable, especially about the girls who populate the college. He has a younger sister named Arisa. ;Chiemi Fujimoto :The second girl to encounter. She is the captain of the girls swim team. Athletic to the core, Chiemi is a robust, competitive, steadfast character with a love for exercise and a fear of caterpillars. ;Yumi Matsumiya :One of the college's professors, principally the player's. With a history for low grades and procrastination, she takes deep concern for his academic development in her classes, counseling him to maintain his studies and do his homework. Single, and much to her confusion, she takes a more than comfortable attraction to him. ;Mayumi Kamijo :A temperamental schoolmate the player bumps into on his way to campus and several times thereafter. Their beginning acquaintances are initially bitter and fierce but they gradually warm up to each other and become friends. Mayumi can be a handful with her habitually spitfire personality, however she is kind and sensitive. In spite of her alibis and defense, she can often be found wandering around sex shops downtown. ;Remi Himekawa :The vice-president of the student council, often regarded as the most intellectually gifted of school. As the daughter of a multimillionaire business magnate, Remi carries herself with the utmost sophistication, spending most of her time studying in school or at the public library. She takes a genuine interest in the player when his intelligence rises and comes to find that she thoroughly enjoys being around him; a change from the otherwise posh lifestyle she's grown bored of. ;Miyuki Tanaka :A shy, soft-spoken girl who enjoys drawing, painting, and is a member of the art club. She is formally introduced to the player through Mikae and takes an interest in him when his concentration in art increases. Though anemic, feeble and sheltered, Miyuki comes to show a much more lecherous, unseen side to herself. ;Misako Sayama :A voluptuous and enticing woman who is often found walking around the downtown city area at night. She is a nursing student living off-campus. Her first impression of the player is an endearing one, however frequent workouts and visits to her ultimately get her attention. Her father, a physician, operates the clinic at the player's college and even visits as a fill-in nurse. ;Ryoko Shimazaki :A renowned singer-songwriter known by the stage name Sonoko Takahashi. She transfers to Meiai later in the game and joins the player's class, disguised with eyeglasses and new hairstyle, seeking to graduate from college and abandon her much popularized life. An orphan by extension of her parent's death at childhood, Ryoko's brother Tadaaki has since become her promoter and manager. ;Arisa Miyoshi :Kazuhiko's peppy younger sister, who at a year younger than him, does not look her age. She attends an all-girl's college and takes a deep admiration for the player when he rescues her from drowning. ;Anze :At first encounter, she seems like no more than an ordinary schoolgirl. It is revealed later on, however, that she is actually an angel from Heaven, sent down to Earth by God to retrieve a relic she dropped and lost. As part of her punishment, Anze transforms into a cat after ten days of searching, though this can be stagnated if the player finds the item himself. Reception True Love, by most accounts of the game's history, was met with lackluster response in Japan. One reason cited for this is that True Love was the fourteenth release by Parsley, a company that had become known for mediocre quality titles at the time of release. The game's localization, especially in North America, however, was more positive.

Following his political career, he served as chairman of Canada Post. First elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1967 by-election, Ouellet served in a number of different positions in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chr√©tien. In his capacity as Registrar General of Canada, he was one of the four signatories of the Proclamation of the Constitution Act of 1982 (along with Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Trudeau, and Justice Minister Jean Chr√©tien). Ouellet represented the safe Liberal seat of Papineau in Montreal for almost thirty years. His hold on the seat was only seriously threatened when the Liberals were crushed by the Progressive Conservative Party in the election of 1984, when he retained his seat by only 500 votes. In opposition, Ouellet became the Liberal's leading figure in the constitutional negotiations that led to the Charlottetown Accord, and was a strong advocate for the constitutional reform proposal, which was rejected in a 1992 referendum. With the return to power of the Liberals after the 1993 election, Ouellet was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by the new prime minister, Jean Chr√©tien. Despite his experience, Ouellet was not popular in Quebec, and the lasting legacy of the Charlottetown Accord hurt him. After the close result of the 1995 Quebec referendum, Chr√©tien wanted to present a new face of his government in Quebec. In 1996, Chr√©tien appointed Ouellet to head the Canada Post Corporation. Ouellet's seat in the House of Commons of Canada was taken by Pierre Pettigrew in a by-election later that year. As cabinet minister, Ouellet had served as Postmaster General. As chairman of Canada Post, he implemented reform that led to record profits in the corporation. In 2004, controversy surrounded Ouellet as Canada Post was one of the organizations embroiled in the Sponsorship Scandal. As a result, Ouellet was suspended from his position at Canada Post in February 2004 by Prime Minister Paul Martin. He resigned as chairman of Canada Post on August 12, 2004, after it was revealed that he failed to provide invoices for hundreds of thousands of dollars of personal expenses, and that he handed out untendered contracts.

Gavriil Loginovich Pribylov (; first name also spelled Gavriel, Gerasim or Gerassim, last name also spelled Pribilof) (died 1796) was a Russian navigator who discovered the Bering Sea islands of St. George Island and St. Paul Island in 1786 and 1787. The islands, and surrounding small islets, now bear his name, being known as the Pribilof Islands. Pribylov was commander of the Russian American Company ship St. George (Sv. Georgii Pobedonosets), a sloop or galiot, when he discovered St. George Island on June 25, 1786, by following the sounds of barking northern fur seals. Pribylov's discovery successfully ended an active three-year search for the lucrative breeding grounds of fur seals by Siberian merchants. His expedition was funded jointly by Grigory Shelikhov and Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin. Shelikhov controlled a monopoly on Aleutian fur-trading activities granted by Empress Catherine II of Russia, but often took on partners to help fund his activities; the two men would later become rivals. More than 20 of Pribylov's crew, which was of mixed Russian and Aleut descent, were left on St. George Island to hunt the seals. Both Russians and Aleuts stayed behind for the hunt. This played a key role in establishing the international hunting of northern fur seals, which continued in various forms until banned by international treaty in 1911, after nearly forcing the seals to extinction. A year later in 1787, Pribylov discovered St. Paul Island, approximately 50 miles to the north of St. George. In truth, Pribylov did not actually discover the islands, as he was directed to their approximate location by the son of an Aleut chief. The then-uninhabited islands, known to the Aleuts as Amiq, were a fabled hunting ground in Aleut oral tradition.

The card called Demotion. Knightmare Chess is a fantasy chess variant published by Steve Jackson Games (SJG) in 1996. It is a translation of a French game Temp√™te sur l'√©chiquier (Storm on the Chessboard), designed by Pierre Cl√©quin and Bruno Faidutti. A stand-alone 80 card expansion called Series 2 was scheduled for a December 1997 release. Overview Knightmare Chess is played with cards that change the default rules of chess. The cards might change how a piece moves, move opponent's pieces, create special squares on the board or otherwise alter the game. For example, a card called Demotion says: :Replace one of your opponent's pieces (except a King or Queen) with one of his captured Pawns. :Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move. There are two sets of cards sold separately, each consisting of 80 cards. The sets are known as Knightmare Chess 1 and Knightmare Chess 2; a single 160 card deck can be created by shuffling both decks together. SJG also sells blank cards, that can be customized by the player, in packs of 20. The graphics in the English version of the Knightmare Chess cards are dark fantasy style, nightmarish (hence the pun Knightmare) color paintings by Brazilian artist Rogerio Vilela. The French original version had a cartoonish tone, unlike the English version, and the cards in the French original version are also different from the English version. Another innovation of the American version is to include rules for \\"dueling deck\\" play, where each player has his own customized deck, possibly built from multiple copies of the set if desired. In SJG's version, each card is marked with a point cost. The total chaotic power of one's personal deck can be measured in the sum of the points of all cards in the deck. For a balanced game each player uses the same point total, or a stronger player can use a lower point total as a handicap. Cards which are too powerful to appear more than once per side are marked with an asterisk, indicating that a player can only put one copy of that specific card in his deck. Critical reaction Peter Sarrett of The Game Report called the game \\"outstanding\\", remarking that it \\"result[s] [in] an unpredictable game which removes the tedium of standard chess while preserving plenty of scope for strategic play,\\" and praising the \\"gorgeous\\" paintings by Rogerio Vilela. Sarrett's only complaints concerned the printing of the cards themselves, as he found the wording occasionally confusing and the text \\"rather small, which makes it difficult for players with poorer eyesight to play the game.\\"Knightmare Chess Review Peter Sarrett, The Game Report, Issue 4.2, Winter 1996 Ken Tidwell of The Game Cabinet praised the game for including \\"elements from both the strategic/predictable side of gaming and the wild/disorderly side\\" and found the artwork \\"striking\\" and \\"succeed[ing] in creating an air of comic horror.\\" He concluded, \\"If I had to find a fault with the game it is that there is no attempt to reconcile the strategic game with the chaotic game and the contrast is a bit jarring. Even so, at the end of the day it is a good game and one well worth checking out.\\"Knightmare Chess Review Ken Tidwell, The Game Cabinet Conversely, Steve Darlington of RPGnet, while finding the artwork \\"absolutely gorgeous\\" and that \\"in terms of sheer presentation ...

Methven was named by an early colonial pioneer, a Mr. R. Patton, who named it for his home in Scotland. It is located near the western edge of the Canterbury Plains, 35 kilometres north of Ashburton and 95 kilometres west of Christchurch. The town slogan is \\"Amazing Space\\".  History  Methven was originally the railhead of a short branch railway off the Main South Line. Branching off from Rakaia, the Methven Branch travelled through Lauriston and Lyndhurst to Methven and operated from 1880 until 1976. With the railway coming all the way into Methven, this led to more shopping opportunities in Methven without the need for a trip to Ashburton. The Mount Hutt Road Board office was completed in 1879. Despite the depression of the 1880s and 1890s, the Methven library was built in 1880s, Methven School was opened in 1882 with 41 pupils, the Anglican church was built in 1880 and the Catholic church in 1888. The population of Methven town was 300 people in 1902. Methven contributed troops to the First World War with 69 on them losing their lives. In the 1920s Methven slowly changed from having livery stables and smithies to garages and engineering firms to service cars and farm machinery. The 1920s also saw the arrival in Methven companies such as Dalgety's and Wright Stevenson and Co. Trucking firms also aimed to compete with the railways to ship farm goods such as wool to the ports. Electricity also arrived around this time. The farm labourers who working on the local farms often resided in Methven or came to Methven to socialize after work. Farm labourers frequented the grocery stores, clothing retailer, pubs, billiard halls, brothels, and boarding houses that were present in Methven in the early days of the town. For the first 100 years of Methven's existence, its primary role was that of servicing the needs of farmers and farm labour.  Demographics  The population was 1707 in the 2013 census, an increase of 309 from 2006. The population increased by 72 people to 1779 people (906 males, 873 females) in the 2018 Census. 91.6% of the population identify as European and 8.4% identify as Maori. There are a total of 849 private dwellings in Methven in 2018. Almost 50% of Methven residents are married and a further 33.7% have never married nor been in a civil union. The median age of Methven residents in 2018 was 39.9 years old. The majority of residents were born in New Zealand (78.3%) with a minority (21.7%) born overseas.  Climate  The warmest months of the year are January and February, with an average high temperature of 22¬∞C. The coldest month of the year occurs in July, when the average high temperature is . Monthly rainfall ranges between an average of in April to in July. Snow falls a few days each year in Methven in the winter months of June, July and August.  Farming  Methven is a rural service town that supports the local region. Dairy farming, sharecropping, sheep farming and seed production and distribution are major players in the farming industry around Methven. The Rangitata Diversion Race was New Zealand's first major river diversion. Construction began in 1937, paused for World War 2 and was completed in 1945. it is 67 kilometers long and provides irrigation to around of farmland around Methven and mid Canterbury. The Mount Hutt Memorial Hall (160 Main Street, Methven) contains the New Zealand Alpine & Agriculture Encounter. It aims to provide an understanding of farming in the area. Methven has an annual A & P Show each year at the A & P Show grounds in Methven. The 2020 A & P show was cancelled due to the Covid-19 Lockdown in New Zealand.  Ski Town  The Methven Lions Club studied whether Mt. Hutt could be developed into a ski field in 1971. The study suggested that this was possible and it led to the opening of Mt. Hutt in 1973. Although the majority of skiers usually made the journey to Mt. Hutt from Christchurch on a daily basis, some would stay the weekend in Methven and need accommodation, dinner and services. This led to the establishment of a number of hotels, motels, restaurants and other tourist activities being developed. The town center was redeveloped with 14 new shops built in 1975. Development continued and by 1989 Methven had five hotels, three motels, twenty ski lodges, two camping grounds and nine restaurants. This diversification of the economy means that during winter Methven undergoes a stark transformation. Mount Hutt skifield is around half an hour away from Methven. As such, a number of cafes, bars, and restaurants lie relatively dormant over the summer months. Similarly, the town's accommodation providers have a strongly seasonal trade. The New Zealand Ski Heritage Museum was established in 2000. It is located in the Mount Hutt Memorial Hall (160 Main Street, Methven). It includes ski fashions, antique ski equipment and Winter Olympic memorabilia. Methven is also a base for heliskiing in the Arrowsmith range of mountains. The annual Peak to Pub race starts at the top of Mt Hutt where competitors ski two kilometres ski down the mountain to the car park. This is followed by an a18-km mountain bike ride down the ski road, followed by a 12-km run into Methven.

Beethoven apparently composed his piece \\"Wellington's Victory\\" (Op. 91) to be played on this behemoth mechanical orchestral organ to commemorate Arthur Wellesley's victory over the French at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. It was one of the first automatic playing machines, similar to the later Orchestrion. The Panharmonicon could imitate all instruments and sound effects like gunfire and cannon shots.Class notes from \\"History of Musical Instruments\\" taught by Dr. Jon C. Mitchell at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Spring 2008. One instrument was destroyed in the Landesgewerbemuseum in Stuttgart during an air raid in World War II. *Friedrich Kaufmann copied this automatic playing machine in 1808 and his family produced Orchestrions from that time on.

The Panharmonicon, which was formerly exhibited here, was made by him: he is likewise the inventor of the Metronome, an instrument by which the time in music is accurately measured; it is not unknown here, and is extensively used in Europe. He has also invented, an apparatus which is attached to a Piano Forte, by which any piece of music which is played on it, is at the same time correctly written out. His speaking figures are of his own make, and far excel the attempts of Von Kempelen, although the labors of the latter, were eminently successful. M√§lzel also was on tour with interruptions with this instrument in the USA from February 7, 1826 until his death in 1838. * In 1817 Flight & Robson in London built a similar automatic instrument called Apollonicon. * In 1821 Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel copied some features of the Panharmonicon in Amsterdam for his instrument the Componium, which was also capable of aleatoric composition.Urania: Musik-Zeitschrift f√ºr Orgelbau, Orgel- und Harmoniumspiel, vol 12, 1855, p. 20 * In 1823 William M.

It is a licence-built version of the Brazilian Embraer EMB 312 Tucano. On 14 February 1986, the prototype conducted its maiden flight in Brazil before being delivered to Shorts to be used as a pattern aircraft and modified to meet Royal Air Force (RAF) requirements and used for trials and demonstrations. The first Short-assembled aircraft flew on 30 December 1986; deliveries to the RAF commenced during June 1988. The final example of the type was completed in 1995. Maintenance and support of the RAF's Tucano fleet was typically outsourced to several private companies. The RAF was the Tucano's primary operator, although export sales have been achieved with the nations of Kenya and Kuwait. A handful have also been purchased and piloted by private individuals. The potential arming of RAF Tucanos to facilitate combat missions and be deployed overseas during War in Afghanistan was at one point mooted. On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service. It has been replaced by the winner of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme, under which civilian- registered Beechcraft T-6Cs have taken on its training duties. Design and development =Origins= Development of the Short Tucano commenced in May 1984, following an agreement between Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer and Northern Ireland aviation firm Short Brothers to collaborate on a response to an outstanding British requirement, which sought a replacement for the aging BAC Jet Provost basic trainer for the Royal Air Force (RAF). For this purpose, the RAF had issued Air Staff Target 412, defining the performance criteria it desire for a new high-performance turboprop-powered basic trainer. A short list was compiled of various aircraft that had been submitted in response; other than the Tucano, the types considered were the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the British NDN-1T Turbo-Firecracker and the Australian Aircraft Consortium's (AAC) A.20 Wamira II. During 1984, Embraer dispatched the seventh EMB-312 airframe off the production line to Shorts, where it received numerous modifications in order to meet the AST-412 requirements. During September 1984, this same aircraft was displayed at the Farnborough Airshow; by this point, it had been equipped with an uprated PT6A-25C2 engine and a ventral air brake, which reportedly enabled the Tucano to achieve the required stall speed of 60 kn. However, tests undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down later on that year indicated the need to re-engine the aircraft in order to satisfy the RAF's requirement for time to height; accordingly, the Garrett TPE331 was selected. On 21 March 1985, the Short Tucano proposal was declared the winner of the AST.412, receiving a contract worth ¬£126 million for the provision of 130 aircraft, along with an option for a further 15; this option was never taken up. The first flight of the prototype EMB-312G2, which was furnished with a four-bladed Hartzell propeller and the Garrett TPE331-10 engine, took place in Brazil on 14 February of the following year. Shortly afterwards, this aircraft was disassembled and airlifted to Short's Belfast facility on 29 March 1986, where it was reassembled and returned to the skies just ten days later. During June of that year, the TPE331-10 engine was replaced by the improved TPE331-12B, a major difference being the integration of an Electronic Engine Controller (EEC) system. =Production= Short-operated prototype, 1991 On 30 December 1986, the first standard production model Tucano T.Mk 1 was flown; its official rollout took place on 20 January 1987. On 10 March 1987, the second aircraft made its first flight, and, by April, a third Tucano had joined the test fleet for clearance and final testing, which was largely undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down. The fourth aircraft to be built was the first delivered to the RAF on 16 June 1988 at the Central Flying School. Deliveries would continue to the RAF for another five years, the final aircraft arriving on 25 January 1993. In addition to the sizable order for the RAF, multiple export customers emerged for the Shorts-produced Tucanos. The Kenyan Air Force ordered a total of 12 units while a further 16 Tucanos were exported to Kuwait. Those Tucanos delivered to the Kuwait Air Force were suitable furnished to be combat-capable, it was armed for the purposes of both weapons training and light attack duties; such aircraft are fitted with four hard points, each capable of mounting various rocket pods, cannons, bombs, and external fuel tanks.\\"Kuwait orders Shorts Tucano trainers.\\" Flight International, 18 February 1989. p. 3. Due to its Garrett engine, the Short Tucano is more responsive to thrust changes and is somewhat noisier than the original Tucano.Wagstaff, Patty. \\"A Twirl In The Tucano.\\" Plane & Pilot, 21 October 2016. In addition to the revised engine, the major differences of the Short Tucano are a strengthened airframe for an improved fatigue life, a cockpit layout similar to the RAF's Hawk advanced trainer, a revised oxygen system, a flight data recorder, a four-bladed propeller, ventral airbrake and restyled wingtips. Two Martin-Baker MB 8LC ejection seats are used and the canopy was modified to meet the RAF's bird strike requirements. During its production run, Shorts commonly promoted the airframe as being \\"100% British- built\\".\\"Shorts Tucano has got what it takes to join the R.A.F.\\" Flight International, 26 January 1985. p. 25. In order to meet RAF requirements, the EMB-312 has some 900 modifications, which reduces commonality with the original aircraft to roughly 50% of its content. Operational history A pair of Tucanos in-flight at the 2012 Royal International Air Tattoo During June 1988, the first Tucano deliveries were made to the RAF; induction of the type commenced thereafter. The type has been principally operated by No. 1 Flying Training School, based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, where it has been used to provide basic fast-jet flying training to RAF and RN student pilots, on 72 (Reserve) Squadron. Typically, student pilots would fly around 130 hours during their training course on the Tucano before progressing to the jet- powered Hawk T2 aircraft, based at RAF Valley. The Short Tucano succeeded the BAC Jet Provost as the basic trainer for the RAF, preparing the student pilots for progression to the Hawk T1 advanced trainer aircraft. Following its introduction, the Tucano had reportedly proven to be roughly 70% cheaper to operate than its predecessor. The Tucano's accident record has also been remarkably better than other ab-initio training aircraft, with only five aircraft written off with no fatalities in over 20 years.https://aviation- safety.net/wikibase/dblist.php?AcType=TUCA In March 2007, while discussing the British military contribution to the War in Afghanistan, the British Parliament discussed the concept of replacing the region's detachment of RAF Harriers and Tornados, which were being used to provide close air support to Allied forces, with a number of armed Short Tucanos, which would be re-roled as a dedicated counter-insurgency asset. Such use would have required extensive modifications to the RAF aircraft, as they were not fitted with underwing hard points for mounting armaments and equipment upon. Air Chief Marshal Stephen Dalton was dismissive of this suggested use of the Tucano, stating that it would cost lives amongst those on the ground and damage Britain's credibility and influence within the coalition forces in Afghanistan, and criticising its lack of operational flexibility. The RAF's Tucanos have been typically maintained by private companies, defence firm VT Group operated one such support contract during the early 2010s. During July 2008, the Tucano's envisioned retirement date was moved from 2010 to around 2012, although further extension seemed likely. At one point, Marshall Aerospace were championing the concept of upgrading the Tucano fleet as an inexpensive means of meeting the RAF's future basic trainer requirements; the prospective upgrade would have been largely based around cockpit instrumentation improvements as the airframes reportedly had around 8,000 flying hours remaining; some aerodynamic refinements had also been mooted but were dismissed as not being cost-effective. By 2010, the Tucano fleet was scheduled to be withdrawn from RAF service in 2015, at which point it was to have been replaced by the winner of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme. However, the type's out of service date was put back by several years; the last of the Beechcraft T-6Cs, the Tucano's direct replacement, was delivered to RAF Valley on 3 December 2018. On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service; to mark the type's retirement, an aerial display was performed at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire, which was also set for closure. Accidents and incidents On 22 Feb 1990, the first export Tucano Mk 51 ZH203 (destined for Kenya) crashed near Rathlin Island due to tailplane flutter in high speed weapons carriage trials, killing Shorts Chief Test Pilot Allan Deacon who ejected but drowned.https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=55330 The RAF lost 5 aircraft in service, all non-fatal (four involved ejections): ZF316 on 12 May 1992,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=156040 ZF270 on 13 May 1996,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=55329 ZF293 on 22 Aug 2000,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=191066 ZF344 on 12 Mar 2009https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=58940 and ZF349 on 8 Jan 2013.https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=152378 On 22 June 2015, two-time Academy Award-winning composer James Horner died when the Tucano he was piloting crashed in central California in a remote region of the Los Padres National Forest about 60 miles (97 km) north of Santa Barbara.

Created and broadcast by PBS in the United States from January 26, 1987 to November 6, 1992, the show was intended to address the math crisis among American schoolchildren. After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns until October 7, 1994. The show was revived for the 1995‚Äì1996 PBS season as a teacher instruction program, Square One TV Math Talk. Square One was also shown on the U.S. cable television channel Noggin in syndication beginning in 1999, but was removed from its lineup along with some other shows on March 31, 2002. Format =Sketches= Square One comprised short sketches that introduced and applied concepts in mathematics such as counting, combinatorics, simple fractions, estimation, probability, and geometry. The sketches featured regular characters and were mainly parodies of pop culture icons, popular television commercials or popular television shows. Sketches were presented in various formats, including music videos featuring a particular subject in mathematics and taught the subject through song (e.g., Roman numerals, obtuse and acute angles, percentages, negative numbers, etc.) or comedic sketches (e.g., General Mathpital, a parody of General Hospital; Nobody's Inn, a parody of Fawlty Towers; Late Afternoon with David Numberman, a parody of Late Night with David Letterman; etc.). \\"Patterns\\", a polka about patterns that can be detected in daily life, was performed by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Since Yankovic did not write this song, it is unavailable on any of his records, though bootleg versions have circulated. The Judds appeared on Square One Television many times, as they performed various songs. Mathcourt was a regular segment that parodied television shows of the day set in courtrooms, presided by Judge Sandra Day O'Crater (played by Cynthia Darlow), who showed zero tolerance for unacceptable behavior from the audiences (and the announcer, with the judge sometimes not knowing who it was), frequently telling the gallery she'd have them do time or punish them in another extreme way if they didn't shut up and stop the interruptions (she even threatened to have them all hanged on one occasion). In all cases, a district attorney was suing a defendant for a math crime the defendant did not commit. The judge was sometimes quick to issue a verdict, but in the end always ruled the defendant innocent after the defendant was able to prove it, leaving the attorney very embarrassed. Mathman was a regular segment as a parody of Pac-Man. The skit helped viewers learn to recognize common mistakes while solving math problems, such as forgetting to carry a digit, or making errors with negative numbers. A blue tornado character named \\"Mr. Glitch\\", a parody of the Ghosts, was Mathman's enemy and would eat him if he got the wrong answers. Pauline's Perilous Pyramid was another sketch that spoofed arcade games. The heroine Pauline would jump around a pyramid similar to the one used in the game Q*bert. Each square had either a positive or negative number on it. Her objective was to get to the very top of the pyramid, keeping the total of the squares she landed on between 25 and -25. Backstage with Blackstone featured math-related magic tricks and performances by Harry Blackstone, Jr.. Each segment involved two cast members at a time (Either Larry Cedar and Cynthia Darlow, Cris Franco and Luisa Leschin or Arthur Howard and Beverly Mickins; Reg E. Cathey portrayed Blackstone's assistant). After performing a trick, Blackstone explained how the trick worked. Other animated segments included The Further Adventures of Zook & Alison; and Fax Headful, a parody of Max Headroom. =Game shows= Several segments featured child contestants competing to win prizes. * But Who's Adding?/But Who's Multiplying?: the show's first original game, hosted by Larry Cedar. Two players captured spaces on a gameboard by adding or multiplying two digits at a time, trying to be the first to complete a row/column/diagonal. * But Who's Counting?: hosted by Monty Carlo (played by Arthur Howard), with Reg E. Cathey as announcer. Two pairs of players (mainly Cynthia Darlow and Cris Franco vs. Larry Cedar and Luisa Leschin, except for one episode in which real kids were the contestants; season 1)/two players (seasons 3-4) (played by the cast members) tried to make the smallest/largest five-digit number possible (seasons 1 and 3), smallest/largest pair of fractions in season 4, placing one digit at a time as it was spun on a carnival wheel. Also in season 1, Beverly Mickins played assistant Amber Jeannette. In later seasons, two solo players competed (again portrayed by the cast). * Piece of the Pie (Introduced in season 2, lasted until season 4): a survey-based game similar to Family Feud, using pie charts and teaching percentages. The game was hosted by Cris Franco, and later by Beverly Mickins. The set was designed like a hole-in-the-wall pie shop for Season 2, and in Seasons 3 and 4, it was designed like a diner. * Close Call: a game about estimation, using \\"how many beans are in this big jar\\"-type of questions, and bearing a similarity to The Price Is Right. Arthur Howard was the original host, replaced at the beginning of Season 4 by Luisa Leschin (who was co-host for the previous season). Leschin's co-host was Reg E. Cathey. The game was originally played as a direct-knockout tournament; it was later changed to a game played for points. * Triple Play: players spun wheels to choose two digits, then had to add/multiply them in order to match numbers on the gameboard, trying to complete a triangle. The game was hosted by Cynthia Darlow, and only lasted one season (Season 2). * Square One Squares: a tic- tac-toe game similar to Hollywood Squares and To Tell the Truth. The game was later replaced by Square One Challenge, which was played for points. Both were hosted by Larry Cedar. All game shows featured Reg E. Cathey as announcer, except for But Who's Adding/But Who's Multiplying?, which had Cynthia Darlow announcing. Season 5 did not feature any game show segments. Mathman Mathman is a video game segment on Square One TV. =Segment format= A parody of Pac-Man, Mathman was a fictional arcade game starring a character of the same name. Mathman's objective was to run around a Pac-Man-like maze board (the traditional dots were replaced with + and - signs) and eventually encounter a number or polygon. He would then have until the count of three to determine if that number/polygon was consistent with a given category (see examples below), and if so, eat it. If he made a mistake, his enemy Mr. Glitch (a parody of the multi-colored Ghost enemies of Pac-Man) would eat him, ending the game. During the later seasons, the format of the game was changed so that Mathman would have to decide if a certain statement (read aloud by the game's announcer) was true or false, and then eat the letter T or F. He would then have until the count of seven to make his decision. These were usually general-knowledge statements about math (e.g., \\"True or False? Mathematics and arithmetic are the same thing\\") rather than questions that required actual problem-solving skills. If Mathman was able to eat all the correct numbers/polygons or answer his questions correctly, he was awarded a free game. However, Mathman accomplished this feat only a handful of times (i.e., \\"Multiples of 3,\\" \\"Factors of 24,\\" \\"Symmetrical Polygons,\\" \\"Rectangles\\" and \\"Fractions Greater than 1\\"). On at least one such occasion, a giant Mr. Glitch ate Mathman as soon as the free game began. Occasionally, Mathman did not play the game himself, making Mr. Glitch the contestant. If he answered incorrectly, he would be eaten by Mathman (or on one occasion, Mathman's dog Mathdog). On one occasion, Mr. Glitch got away with an incorrect answer, but on the second incorrect answer, he was eaten by a giant Mathman. Common categories *Polygons (e.g., Symmetrical Polygons, Pentagons, etc.) *Multiples or factors of a certain numberSquare One TV: Episode 144 TV.com *Inequalities (involving either numbers or formulae) *Even numbers or Odd numbers *True or False questions =Characters= Mathman Mathman was a green, Pac-Man-like character with a big mouth, a winged football helmet patterned after that of the University of Michigan Wolverines, and a single foot on which he walked around the game maze. When he moved around the maze, he would repeat the phrase \\"Mathman, Mathman, Mathman,\\" similar to Pac-Man's familiar \\"wakka-wakka-wakka\\". Mathdog Mathdog was Mathman's pet dog and wore a football helmet like that of Mathman. When he went around the maze, he would say \\"Mathdog, Mathdog, Mathdog.\\" Mr. Glitch Mathman's nemesis was Mr. Glitch, a cranky tornado who was always described with a different negative adjective. He was a parody of the multi-colored Ghost enemies of Pac- Man and would appear whenever Mathman had to make a decision. If Mathman ate an incorrect number or polygon, answered a question incorrectly, or used up too much time, Mr. Glitch would \\"power up\\" (with lightning bolts and thunder crashing), chase after Mathman, and then eat him. He won this right the majority of the times the game was played, only being defeated a handful of times. Occasionally, Mathman did not play the game himself, making Mr. Glitch the contestant. If he answered incorrectly, he would be eaten by Mathman (or on one occasion, Mathman's dog, Mathdog). On one occasion, Mr. Glitch got away with an incorrect answer, but on the second incorrect answer, he was eaten by a giant Mathman. The Announcer At the beginning of each sketch, an off-screen voice told either Mathman or Mr. Glitch what his mission would be. Then, a warning was issued to the playing character stating \\"He will eat you if you are wrong.\\" He also congratulated Mathman and awarded him a free game if he finished the game perfectly. Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade is a cartoon segment on the PBS television show Square One TV. The title character, Lt. Dirk Niblick, is tasked in each segment with helping friends through practical dilemmas through the use of mathematics. Episodes frequently center on outsmarting scam artists who use deceptive language to attempt to trick the protagonists out of money or property. Most episodes also feature Dirk having one or more telephone conversations with his mother. Supporting characters on the show include Dirk's two young friends, the brother-and-sister pair Fluff and Fold Noodleman, and Dirk's neighbor, Mr. Beasley. The Dirk Niblick segments are similar in appearance to the 1965 cartoon Roger Ramjet; Fred Crippen animated for both, and Gary Owens voiced both title characters. =Cast= * Gary Owens ‚Äî Dirk Niblick * Bob Arbogast ‚Äî Mr. Wallace C.

A parody of Dragnet, the storyline of each skit featured the detectives attempting to solve a crime by using math. Each Mathnet story line spanned five episodes, or one complete broadcast week (Monday through Friday). Originally set in Los Angeles, the skit was later expanded to New York City as a secondary setting. Leech left the show after the third season; she was replaced by Toni DiBuono, playing Pat Tuesday.

Geography Huayhuash range as seen from the International Space Station in 2008. The Huayhuash range is 30 km long north to south and includes seven peaks over 6000 m including Yerupaj√° which, at , is the second highest peak in Peru. Another notable peak, Siula (6,344 m) was made famous by mountaineer Joe Simpson in his book Touching the Void. Unlike neighboring Cordillera Blanca, Waywash doesn't possess broad valleys and mountain passes are higher. There are many lesser peaks surrounding those covered by ice, and several passes exceeding 5,000 m. It is necessary to travel a considerable distance from the central range to find ground lower than 3,000 m, even on valley floors, and the range is often taken to include this much larger area. The vegetated areas of the range are part of the Central Andean wet puna ecoregion The area is barely populated at all, with what hamlets there are being very small and generally only found below 4000 m (the snowline is found at approximately 4,800 m). The nearest villages are Chiqui√°n (3,400 m) and Cajatambo (3,375 m). Some mining takes place in the area, so to the north of the mountains there is an unsurfaced road leading up to as high as 4750 m. In 2002 the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture declared the Huayhuash mountain range a \\"reserved zone\\" and prohibited certain economic activities, including any future mining. = Peaks = A selection of the highest peaks of the Waywash range is listed below. * Yerupaj√°, * Siula, * Sarapo, * Jirishanca, * Yerupaja Chico, * Rasac, * Carnicero, * Rondoy, * Seria N, * El Toro, * Tsacra (or Sacra), * Mituraju, * Jurau, * Trapecio, * Huacshash, * Suerococha, * Huacrish, * Ninashanca, * Quesillo, * Pariauccro, * Mitopunta, * Seria Punta, * Ancocancha, * Auxilio, * Cuyoc, * Huaraca, * Pumarinri, * Jirishanca Chico, * Sueroraju, * Rajucollota, * Puscanturpa, * Jullutahuarco, * Sarapococha, * Alcay, * Paria, * Suerococha (Ancash), * Suerococha (Cajatambo), * Julc√°n, * Gasha, Trekking The range has become noted for trekking in the form of the Huayhuash Circuit which is considered quite a challenge and is undoubtedly far more demanding than the famous Inca Trail in the south of Peru. Fewer people trek the Cordillera Huayhuash than the nearby Cordillera Blanca. The circuit generally takes between ten and fourteen days, depending on the route taken. Mitucocha camp and Jirishanca 6094 mleft Most of the walking and most of the campsites are above the 4,000 m tree line, so the landscape appears rugged and mountainous, affording views over very wide areas. The area is noted for its spectacular glacial lakes. Hot springs can also be found in the area, at Viconga Campsite precisely. Condors, llamas, alpacas and viscachas can be seen. Trekking is almost always undertaken in the dry winter months of May to September, and the cities Huaraz and Caraz over 100 & 167 km away are the usual choice for organizing and hiring camping a/o logistical support. Chiqui√°n was the \\"Gateway to the Huayhuash\\" for a long time, but nowadays, daily buses (locally called colectivos) go deep into the mountains to the village Llamaq (3,300 m) and with private transport, as far as Cuartelwain camp, reached both by road built in the late 90s and 2000s, becoming now the new trail heads for starting/ending. More challenging yet is the Alpine Circuit, which encircles the peaks at closer proximity. The Alpine Circuit involves some rock climbing and glacier travel, and takes 8‚Äì10 days to complete. There are several lakes like Solteracoha (or Solterococha), Siula, Jahuacocha, Carhuacocha and Sarapococha. Hiking the Alpine Circuit in the Waywash mountain range. In the background are (L to R) Rasac, Yerupaja, Siula Grande and Sarapo. Safety Until the group's effective defeat in 1992 the Huayhuash range was used as a remote base by the Shining Path communist guerrilla. On July 28, 1988, a group of Canadian and Peruvian climbers were held hostage for 12 hours after a failed assassination attempt on a group of military police. None of the climbers or police were hurt, though one Senderista was killed. In the late 1980s a party of European trekkers were robbed and ordered to return to Huaraz with the message that future intruders would be killed. The remains of a guerrilla camp can be seen near the lake Viconga. Two foreign trekkers are known to have been murdered in Cajatambo in August 2002, though this is thought to have been motivated by robbery. Four hikers who resisted armed robbery were shot in 2004, one dying of blood loss before rescue. Since this last incident, the local communities began to charge a \\"protection\\" fee for passing in the private properties. Since then, the area is considered generally safe. Near the north shore of the lake Viconga, the remains of an old Shining Path base camp can be still visited, including a shooting range, barracks and a training field.  Biodiversity  The area preserves high elevation Andean grasslands and patches of forest. Some of the native tree species present in the area are the Andean alder and trees of the genus Polylepis. Animals that can be found in the area include: the giant conebill, the tit-like dacnis, the torrent duck, the Andean mountain cat, the taruca, the Andean condor, the peregrine falcon, the giant coot, etc. References External links * Cordillera Huayhuash. 3D view on Google Maps * Cordillera Huayhuash.

The service is available in the US with localized versions on MTV's global network. In February 2016, MTV Networks confirmed it would refresh the MTV News brand in 2016, to compete with the likes of BuzzFeed and Vice, however by mid-2017 MTV News was significantly downsized due to cutbacks. MTV News content is available from respective MTV websites, Apps, YouTube and on-air. In November 2018, MTV News will produce daily updates on Twitter titled MTV News: You Need To Know. History MTV News began in the late 1980s with the program The Week in Rock, hosted by Kurt Loder, the first official MTV News correspondent. Since 1990, the opening riff to Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells\\" has been the main opening theme for The Week in Rock. It first began covering political news in the 1992 American presidential elections, through its \\"Choose or Lose\\" campaign. Since then, MTV has run \\"Choose or Lose\\" for other presidential elections in the United States. For the 2008 election, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared on an MTV special to discuss the Iraq war. Throughout the 2000s, MTV News began publishing digital editorial content via their website, Twitter feed, YouTube channel and Facebook page, offering information about MTV programming and music/pop-culture news aggregation. In November 2015, MTV introduced a new direction for its news department and hired Dan Fierman, former editorial director of Grantland, as MTV's editorial director and announced it would produce longform journalism, think pieces and diversify its staff. However, in June 2017, MTV decided to restructure its news division with a greater focus on video, laying off much of their editorial staff. In December 2016, MTV News posted a video called \\"2017 New Years Resolutions for White Guys\\" as a New Year's special. The video features people telling white men what they think should do better in the then upcoming year of 2017. The video gained huge backlash for being racist and bigoted. The reupload of the video currently has 54,910 dislikes and 1,152 likes on YouTube.  MTV News in the U.S.  = Current and former correspondents =  MTV News International  When MTV launched in Europe it used a variation of MTV News US reports with localized European reporting. Upon regionalization of MTV channels in 1997, MTV begun to localize presenters and reporting depending on the MTV region. Its flagship programming in Europe consisted of a daily news update MTV News Update and a weekly highlights show called MTV News Weekend Edition, these ceased airing in the early 2000s. With the move of MTV towards more reality based programming MTV News bulletins became a short news bulletin on the hours between 16:00 to 22:00 Monday to Friday on some MTV channels. As of July 2013, Viacom International Media Networks has launched a new news bulletin which utilises the existing MTV News UK broadcasts. These MTV News International bulletins air on the majority of MTV channels (with exception to MTV US, MTV Canada, MTV Italy, MTV Brazil, MTV Japan, MTV China and MTV Latin America) in the English language which are either dubbed or subtitled.

Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the \\"ceremonial\\" sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton.Walton H. Hamilton (1919). \\"The Institutional Approach to Economic Theory,\\" American Economic Review, 9(1), Supplement, pp. 309‚Äì18. Reprinted in R. Albelda, C. Gunn, and W.

June 1933. pp. 274‚Äì77. Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.Warren J. Samuels ([1987] 2008). \\"institutional economics,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics. Abstract. \\"Traditional\\" institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy). Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley.) Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assuming stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons.Malcolm,Dewey and Reese Rutherford (2008). \\"institutionalism, old,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, v. 4, pp. 374‚Äì81. Abstract. Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically-bounded social system; other institutionalist economists disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals. A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there has been heated debate on the role of law (a formal institution) on economic growth.Li, Rita Yi Man and Li, Yi Lut (2013) The relationship between law and economic growth: A paradox in China Cities, Asian Social Science, Vol. 9, No. 9, pp. 19‚Äì30, https://ssrn.com/abstract=2290481 Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior. Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Marc Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies. Thorstein Veblen Thorstein Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural Mid-western America. Thorstein Veblen (1857‚Äì1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899). In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism for people to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen's critique. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient. In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change. Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen's warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true. Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled \\"Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science\\"Veblen, Th. 1898 \\"Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science\\", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 12. and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics. John R. Commons John R. Commons (1862‚Äì1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in Institutional Economics (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes. Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions. Wesley Mitchell Wesley Clair Mitchell (1874‚Äì1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades. Mitchell's teachers included economists Thorstein Veblen and J. L. Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey. Clarence Ayres Clarence Ayres (1891‚Äì1972) was the principal thinker of what some have called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of \\"technology\\" and \\"institutions\\" to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions. It can be argued that Ayres was not an \\"institutionalist\\" in any normal sense of the term, since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as \\"Schein\\" (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres' position would be that of a \\"techno-behaviorist\\" rather than an institutionalist. Adolf Berle Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr. Adolf A. Berle (1895‚Äì1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a founding pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account. Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered. Berle served in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration through the depression, and was a key member of the so-called \\"Brain trust\\" developing many of the New Deal policies. In 1967, Berle and Means issued a revised edition of their work, in which the preface added a new dimension. It was not only the separation of controllers of companies from the owners as shareholders at stake. They posed the question of what the corporate structure was really meant to achieve. > ‚ÄúStockholders toil not, neither do they spin, to earn [dividends and share > price increases]. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification for > their inheritance... can be founded only upon social grounds... that > justification turns on the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. > Its force exists only in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold > such wealth. Justification for the stockholder's existence thus depends on > increasing distribution within the American population. Ideally the > stockholder's position will be impregnable only when every American family > has its fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity > to develop individuality becomes fully actualized.‚ÄùBerle (1967) p. xxiii John Kenneth Galbraith John Kenneth Galbraith (1908‚Äì2006) worked in the New Deal administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Although he wrote later, and was more developed than the earlier institutional economists, Galbraith was critical of orthodox economics throughout the late twentieth century. In The Affluent Society (1958), Galbraith argues voters reaching a certain material wealth begin to vote against the common good. He uses the term \\"conventional wisdom\\" to refer to the orthodox ideas that underpin the resulting conservative consensus.Galbraith (1958) Chapter 2 (Although Galbraith claimed to coin the phrase 'conventional wisdom,' the phrase is used several times in a book by Thorstein Veblen that Galbraith might have read, The Instinct of Workmanship.) In an age of big business, it is unrealistic to think only of markets of the classical kind. Big businesses set their own terms in the marketplace, and use their combined resources for advertising programmes to support demand for their own products. As a result, individual preferences actually reflect the preferences of entrenched corporations, a \\"dependence effect\\", and the economy as a whole is geared to irrational goals.Galbraith (1958) Chapter 11 In The New Industrial State Galbraith argues that economic decisions are planned by a private bureaucracy, a technostructure of experts who manipulate marketing and public relations channels. This hierarchy is self-serving, profits are no longer the prime motivator, and even managers are not in control. Because they are the new planners, corporations detest risk, requiring steady economic and stable markets. They recruit governments to serve their interests with fiscal and monetary policy. While the goals of an affluent society and complicit government serve the irrational technostructure, public space is simultaneously impoverished. Galbraith paints the picture of stepping from penthouse villas on to unpaved streets, from landscaped gardens to unkempt public parks. In Economics and the Public Purpose (1973) Galbraith advocates a \\"new socialism\\" (social democracy) as the solution, with nationalization of military production and public services such as health care, plus disciplined salary and price controls to reduce inequality and hamper inflation.

Institutionalist political economy The vacillations of institutions are necessarily a result of the very incentives created by such institutions, and are thus endogenous. Emphatically, traditional institutionalism is in many ways a response to the current economic orthodoxy; its reintroduction in the form of institutionalist political economy is thus an explicit challenge to neoclassical economics, since it is based on the fundamental premise that neoclassicists oppose: that economics cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. Institutionalism today The earlier approach was a central element in American economics in the interwar years after 1919, but was marginalized relative to mainstream economics in the postwar period with the ascendence of neoclassical and Keynesian approaches. It continued, however, as a leading heterodox approach in critiquing neoclassical economics and as an alternative research program in economics, most notably through the work of Ha-Joon Chang and Geoffrey Hodgson The leading Swedish economist Lars P√•lsson Syll is a believer in institutional economics. He is an outspoken opponent to all kinds of social constructivism and postmodern relativism. Criticism Critics of institutionalism have maintained that the concept of \\"institution\\" is so central for all social science that it is senseless to use it as a buzzword for a particular theoretical school. And as a consequence, the elusive meaning of the concept of \\"institution\\" has resulted in a bewildering and never-ending dispute about which scholars are \\"institutionalists\\" or not‚Äîand a similar confusion about what is supposed to be the core of the theory. In other words, institutional economics has become so popular because it means all things to all people, which in the end of the day is the meaning of nothing.David Hamilton, \\"Why is Institutional economics not institutional?\\" The American Journal of Economics and Sociology. Vol. 21. no. 3. July 1962. pp. 309‚Äì17. Indeed, it can be argued that the term \\"institutionalists\\" was misplaced from the very beginning, since Veblen, Hamilton and Ayres were preoccupied with the evolutionary (and \\"objectifying\\") forces of technology and institutions had a secondary place within their theories. Institutions were almost a kind of \\"anti-stuff\\"; their key concern was on technology and not on institutions. Rather than being \\"institutional,\\" Veblen, Hamilton and Ayres‚Äô position is anti-institutional. Response According to Thaler and Sunstein, a person is not generally best described as an Econ, a person with mainly self-interest in mind, but rather as a Human. Institutional economics, consistent with Thaler and Sunstein, sees humans as social and part of a community, which has been extracted from neoclassical economics. The Metaeconomics Frame and Dual Interest Theory argues that it is essential to integrate institutional and neoclassical economics.

This process is called sensory transduction. The cell bodies of the sensory neurons are located in the dorsal ganglia of the spinal cord. This sensory information travels along afferent nerve fibers in an afferent or sensory nerve, to the brain via the spinal cord. The stimulus can come from extoreceptors outside the body, for example light and sound, or from interoreceptors inside the body, for example blood pressure or the sense of body position. Different types of sensory neurons have different sensory receptors that respond to different kinds of stimuli.  Types and function  = External = External receptors that respond to stimuli from outside the body are called extoreceptors.  Smell  The sensory neurons involved in smell are called olfactory sensory neurons. These neurons contain receptors, called olfactory receptors, that are activated by odor molecules in the air. The molecules in the air are detected by enlarged cilia and microvilli.Breed, Michael D., and Moore, Janice. Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior . London: Elsevier, 2010. Print. These nerves help send signals to the brain with emotions.  Taste  Similarly to Olfactory receptors, taste receptors (gustatory receptors) in taste buds interact with chemicals in food to produce an action potential.  Vision  Photoreceptor cells are capable of phototransduction, a process which converts light (electromagnetic radiation) into electrical signals. These signals are refined and controlled by the interactions with other types of neurons in the retina. The five basic classes of neurons within the retina are photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells. The basic circuitry of the retina incorporates a three-neuron chain consisting of the photoreceptor (either a rod or cone), bipolar cell, and the ganglion cell. The first action potential occurs in the retinal ganglion cell. This pathway is the most direct way for transmitting visual information to the brain. There are three primary types of photoreceptors: Cones are photoreceptors that respond significantly to color. In humans the three different types of cones correspond with a primary response to short wavelength (blue), medium wavelength (green), and long wavelength (yellow/red).\\"eye, human.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010. Rods are photoreceptors that are very sensitive to the intensity of light, allowing for vision in dim lighting. The concentrations and ratio of rods to cones is strongly correlated with whether an animal is diurnal or nocturnal. In humans, rods outnumber cones by approximately 20:1, while in nocturnal animals, such as the tawny owl, the ratio is closer to 1000:1. Retinal ganglion cells are involved in the sympathetic response. Of the ~1.3 million ganglion cells present in the retina, 1-2% are believed to be photosensitive.Foster, R. G.; Provencio, I.; Hudson, D.; Fiske, S.; Grip, W.; Menaker, M. (1991). \\"Circadian photoreception in the retinally degenerate mouse (rd/rd)\\". Journal of Comparative Physiology A 169. Problems and decay of sensory neurons associated with vision lead to disorders such as: * Macular degeneration ‚Äì degeneration of the central visual field due to either cellular debris or blood vessels accumulating between the retina and the choroid, thereby disturbing and/or destroying the complex interplay of neurons that are present there. * Glaucoma ‚Äì loss of retinal ganglion cells which causes some loss of vision to blindness. * Diabetic retinopathy ‚Äì poor blood sugar control due to diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina.  Auditory  The auditory system is responsible for converting pressure waves generated by vibrating air molecules or sound into signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This mechanoelectrical transduction is mediated with hair cells within the ear. Depending on the movement, the hair cell can either hyperpolarize or depolarize. When the movement is towards the tallest stereocilia, the Na+ cation channels open allowing Na+ to flow into cell and the resulting depolarization causes the Ca++ channels to open, thus releasing its neurotransmitter into the afferent auditory nerve. There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. The inner hair cells are the sensory receptors . Problems with sensory neurons associated with the auditory system leads to disorders such as: * Auditory processing disorder ‚Äì Auditory information in the brain is processed in an abnormal way. Patients with auditory processing disorder can usually gain the information normally, but their brain cannot process it properly, leading to hearing disability. * Auditory verbal agnosia ‚Äì Comprehension of speech is lost but hearing, speaking, reading, and writing ability is retained. This is caused by damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes, again not allowing the brain to process auditory input correctly.  Temperature  Thermoreceptors are sensory receptors, which respond to varying [temperature]s. While the mechanisms through which these receptors operate is unclear, recent discoveries have shown that mammals have at least two distinct types of thermoreceptors.Krantz, John. Experiencing Sensation and Perception . Pearson Education, Limited, 2009. p. 12.3 The bulboid corpuscle, is a cutaneous receptor a cold-sensitive receptor, that detects cold temperatures. The other type is a warmth-sensitive receptor.  Mechanoreceptors  Mechanoreceptors are sensory receptors which respond to mechanical forces, such as pressure or distortion.Winter, R., Harrar, V., Gozdzik, M., & Harris, L. R. (2008). The relative timing of active and passive touch. [Proceedings Paper]. Brain Research, 1242, 54-58. Specialized sensory receptor cells called mechanoreceptors often encapsulate afferent fibers to help tune the afferent fibers to the different types of somatic stimulation. Mechanoreceptors also help lower thresholds for action potential generation in afferent fibers and thus make them more likely to fire in the presence of sensory stimulation. Some types of mechanoreceptors fire action potentials when their membranes are physically stretched. Proprioceptors are another type of mechanoreceptors which literally means \\"receptors for self\\". These receptors provide spatial information about limbs and other body parts. Nociceptors are responsible for processing pain and temperature changes. The burning pain and irritation experienced after eating a chili pepper (due to its main ingredient, capsaicin), the cold sensation experienced after ingesting a chemical such as menthol or icillin, as well as the common sensation of pain are all a result of neurons with these receptors. Problems with mechanoreceptors lead to disorders such as: * Neuropathic pain - a severe pain condition resulting from a damaged sensory nerve * Hyperalgesia - an increased sensitivity to pain caused by sensory ion channel, TRPM8, which is typically responds to temperatures between 23 and 26 degrees, and provides the cooling sensation associated with menthol and icillin * Phantom limb syndrome - a sensory system disorder where pain or movement is experienced in a limb that does not exist = Internal = Internal receptors that respond to changes inside the body are known as interoceptors.  Blood  The aortic bodies and carotid bodies contain clusters of glomus cells ‚Äì peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in chemical properties in the blood such as oxygen concentration.Satir, P. & Christensen, S.T. (2008) Structure and function of mammalian cilia. in Histochemistry and Cell Biology, Vol 129:6 These receptors are polymodal responding to a number of different stimuli.  Nociceptors  Nociceptors respond to potentially damaging stimuli by sending signals to the spinal cord and brain. This process, called nociception, usually causes the perception of pain.Sherrington C. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 1906. They are found in internal organs as well as on the surface of the body to \\"detect and protect\\". Nociceptors detect different kinds of noxious stimuli indicating potential for damage, then initiate neural responses to withdraw from the stimulus. * Thermal nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. * Mechanical nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation, such as a pinch. * Chemical nociceptors respond to a wide variety of chemicals, some of which signal a response. They are involved in the detection of some spices in food, such as the pungent ingredients in Brassica and Allium plants, which target the sensory neural receptor to produce acute pain and subsequent pain hypersensitivity.  Connection with the central nervous system  Information coming from the sensory neurons in the head enters the central nervous system (CNS) through cranial nerves. Information from the sensory neurons below the head enters the spinal cord and passes towards the brain through the 31 spinal nerves. The sensory information traveling through the spinal cord follows well-defined pathways. The nervous system codes the differences among the sensations in terms of which cells are active.  Classification  = Adequate stimulus = A sensory receptor's adequate stimulus is the stimulus modality for which it possesses the adequate sensory transduction apparatus. Adequate stimulus can be used to classify sensory receptors: * Baroreceptors respond to pressure in blood vessels * Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli * Electromagnetic radiation receptors respond to electromagnetic radiation ** Infrared receptors respond to infrared radiation ** Photoreceptors respond to visible light ** Ultraviolet receptors respond to ultraviolet radiation * Electroreceptors respond to electric fields ** Ampullae of Lorenzini respond to electric fields, salinity, and to temperature, but function primarily as electroreceptors * Hydroreceptors respond to changes in humidity * Magnetoreceptors respond to magnetic fields * Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stress or mechanical strain * Nociceptors respond to damage, or threat of damage, to body tissues, leading (often but not always) to pain perception * Osmoreceptors respond to the osmolarity of fluids (such as in the hypothalamus) * Proprioceptors provide the sense of position * Thermoreceptors respond to temperature, either heat, cold or both = Location = Sensory receptors can be classified by location: * Cutaneous receptors are sensory receptors found in the dermis or epidermis.http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cutaneous+receptor * Muscle spindles contain mechanoreceptors that detect stretch in muscles. = Morphology = Somatic sensory receptors near the surface of the skin can usually be divided into two groups based on morphology: * Free nerve endings characterize the nociceptors and thermoreceptors and are called thus because the terminal branches of the neuron are unmyelinated and spread throughout the dermis and epidermis. * Encapsulated receptors consist of the remaining types of cutaneous receptors. Encapsulation exists for specialized functioning. = Rate of adaptation = * A tonic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts slowly to a stimulus and continues to produce action potentials over the duration of the stimulus.mentor.lscf.ucsb.edu/course/fall/eemb157/lecture/Lectures%2016,%2017%2018.ppt In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus. Some tonic receptors are permanently active and indicate a background level. Examples of such tonic receptors are pain receptors, joint capsule, and muscle spindle.http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jshardo/bly2010/nervous/receptor.html * A phasic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts rapidly to a stimulus. The response of the cell diminishes very quickly and then stops. It does not provide information on the duration of the stimulus; instead some of them convey information on rapid changes in stimulus intensity and rate. An example of a phasic receptor is the Pacinian corpuscle. Drugs There are many drugs currently on the market that are used to manipulate or treat sensory system disorders. For instance, Gabapentin is a drug that is used to treat neuropathic pain by interacting with one of the voltage-dependent calcium channels present on non-receptive neurons. Some drugs may be used to combat other health problems, but can have unintended side effects on the sensory system. Ototoxic drugs are drugs which affect the cochlea through the use of a toxin like aminoglycoside antibiotics, which poison hair cells. Through the use of these toxins, the K+ pumping hair cells cease their function. Thus, the energy generated by the endocochlear potential which drives the auditory signal transduction process is lost, leading to hearing loss. Neuroplasticity Ever since scientists observed cortical remapping in the brain of Taub's Silver Spring monkeys, there has been a lot of research into sensory system plasticity. Huge strides have been made in treating disorders of the sensory system. Techniques such as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by Taub have helped patients with paralyzed limbs regain use of their limbs by forcing the sensory system to grow new neural pathways.Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 160; \\"Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy\\", excerpted from \\"A Rehab Revolution,\\" Stroke Connection Magazine, September/October 2004. Print. Phantom limb syndrome is a sensory system disorder in which amputees perceive that their amputated limb still exists and they may still be experiencing pain in it. The mirror box developed by V.S. Ramachandran, has enabled patients with phantom limb syndrome to relieve the perception of paralyzed or painful phantom limbs. It is a simple device which uses a mirror in a box to create an illusion in which the sensory system perceives that it is seeing two hands instead of one, therefore allowing the sensory system to control the \\"phantom limb\\". By doing this, the sensory system can gradually get acclimated to the amputated limb, and thus alleviate this syndrome.

According to its website, \\"We believe that every baby deserves the best possible start. Unfortunately, not all babies get one. We are changing that.\\" The organization was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name \\"March of Dimes\\" was coined by Eddie Cantor. After funding Jonas Salk's polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. In 2005, as preterm birth emerged as the leading cause of death for children worldwide, research and prevention of premature birth became the organization's primary focus. Organization March of Dimes improves the health of mothers and babies through five programming areas: medical research, education of pregnant women, community programs, government advocacy, and support of pregnant women and mothers. The organization provides women and families with educational resources on baby health, pregnancy, preconception and new motherhood, as well as supplying information and support to families in the NICU who are affected by prematurity, birth defects, or other infant health problems. The organization began in 1938 as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. In 1976 it became known as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. In 2007, the formal name became the March of Dimes Foundation. Anti-polio efforts Missy LeHand with 30,000 letters containing ten-cent contributions to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis that arrived at the White House the morning of January 28, 1938 The group was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 3, 1938, as a response to U.S. epidemics of polio, a condition that can leave people with permanent physical disabilities. Roosevelt was himself diagnosed with polio in 1921, although his symptoms are now known to be more consistent with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome ‚Äì an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. The foundation was an alliance between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was a reconstitution of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which Roosevelt and his friend Basil O'Connor founded with other friends in 1927. O'Connor became the foundation's president, a position he held for more than three decades. His first task was to create a network of local chapters that could raise money and deliver aid; more than 3,100 county chapters were established during his tenure. The name \\"March of Dimes\\" ‚Äî a play on the contemporary radio and newsreel series, The March of Time ‚Äî was coined by stage, screen and radio star Eddie Cantor.Barrett, William P. \\"March of Dimes' Second Act\\". Forbes, November 19, 2008. He inspired a nationwide fundraising campaign in the week preceding President Roosevelt's birthday on January 30, 1938. Lapel pins were sold for ten cents each; special features were produced by the motion picture studios and radio industry; and nightclubs and cabarets held dances and contributed a portion of the proceeds. Thousands of people mailed cards and letters, each containing a dime, to the White House. Cantor's appeal collected more than $85,000 in what the press called \\"a silver tide which actually swamped the White House.\\" \\"During the past few days bags of mail have been coming, literally by the truck load, to the White House,\\" Roosevelt said during his birthday celebration broadcast January 30, 1938. \\"Yesterday between forty and fifty thousand letters came to the mail room of the White House. Today an even greater number ‚Äî how many I cannot tell you ‚Äî for we can only estimate the actual count by counting the mail bags. In all the envelopes are dimes and quarters and even dollar bills ‚Äî gifts from grown-ups and children ‚Äî mostly from children who want to help other children get well. ‚Ä¶ It is glorious to have one's birthday associated with a work like this.\\" The March of Dimes was the title used for the foundation's annual fundraising event that requested each child donate a dime. At the Christmas season, booths were set up in cities where the children could drop their dime in a slot. These were out on the street and sometimes not even overseen by anyone. Gradually the name became synonymous with that of the organization. \\"His genius was in generating large numbers of relatively small contributions for a cause,\\" The New York Times wrote of O'Connor. \\"Over the years he collected and spent more than seven billion dimes ‚Äî many of them from schoolchildren ‚Äî with a half- billion dollars of it going to the war on polio.\\" 100px Publisher Gerard Piel credited O'Connor with a \\"unique social invention: a permanently self- sustaining source of funds for the support of research ‚Äî the voluntary health organization.\\" With a centralized administration, state and local chapters and a large corps of volunteers, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis became the prototype for dozens of similar foundations. Because Franklin D. Roosevelt founded the March of Dimes, a redesign of the dime was chosen to honor him after his death. The Roosevelt dime was issued in 1946, on what would have been the president's 64th birthday. From 1938 through the approval of the Salk vaccine in 1955, the foundation spent $233 million on polio patient care, which led to more than 80 percent of U.S. polio patients' receiving significant foundation aid. = Sabin vaccine and conflict with the March of Dimes = Around the same time, Albert Sabin (also with funding from the March of Dimes) developed a simpler version of the vaccine, which was based on an attenuated live version of the polio virus. Both Salk's version and Sabin's version had potential safety concerns; Salk's vaccine had the risk of a virus which is not completely inactivated, while Sabin's vaccine had the risk of reversion to virulence. In 1955, a batch of Salk's vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories in California was inadequately inactivated and, as a result, 11 children died. After this incident, production methods were changed and no further incidents were reported. Sabin became highly critical of O'Connor and the March of Dimes, who he believed were biased towards Salk's vaccine and made statements inconsistent with the scientific research. In the meantime, trials of the vaccine based on Sabin's version were carried out in the Soviet Union with important contributions made by Mikhail Chumakov. In 1958, the Soviet Union organized industrial production of this vaccine and polio was largely eradicated in Eastern Europe and Japan. This success led to trials in the United States as well and the licensing of Sabin's vaccine in 1961, over the considerable opposition of the March of Dimes, which supported Salk's vaccine. Eventually, Sabin's vaccine superseded Salk's vaccine based on its advantages, which included a simpler (oral) administration and lifelong immunity. =Gallery= File:Birthday-Ball-Check-May-1934-2.jpgFDR receives a $1 million check, proceeds from the first President's Birthday Ball (1934) File:Birthday-Ball-Group-1937.jpgEleanor Roosevelt with celebrities invited to Washington, D.C., for the 1937 President's Birthday Ball File:FDR-Enrolled- Founder-1938.jpgFDR buys a certificate enrolling him as \\"Founder No. 1\\" of the new National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (1938) File:Presidents- Birthday-Ball-1939.jpgPoster for the 1939 President's Birthday Ball File:ER- President's-Birthday-Ball-Ticket-1940.jpgEleanor Roosevelt buys the first ticket for the 1940 President's Birthday Ball File:Glenn-Miller- President's-Birthday-Ball-1942.jpgGlenn Miller recorded Irving Berlin's \\"At the President's Birthday Ball\\" (1942) File:Roosevelt OConnor.jpgFDR with Basil O'Connor (1944) File:Birthday-Ball-Life-1944.jpgEleanor Roosevelt with celebrities invited to Washington, D.C., for the 1944 President's Birthday Ball File:Birthday-Ball-Lucille-Ball-ER-Life-1944.jpgEleanor Roosevelt and Lucille Ball at the 1944 President's Birthday Ball File:Red Skelton and John Garfield at FDR Birthday Ball 1944.jpg1944 President's Birthday Ball File:Birthday-Ball-Group-1945.jpgEleanor Roosevelt with celebrities invited to Washington, D.C., for the 1945 President's Birthday Ball Change of mission March of Dimes polio poster (1957) Following widespread use of the polio vaccine, the organization was faced with disbanding or steering its resources toward a new mission. Basil O'Connor, then the organization's president, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and reformulate its mission. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) in 1958 and launched its \\"Expanded Program\\" against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a \\"flexible force\\" in the field of public health. In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission.Katz, Michael. \\"A Genetic Pioneer Focused On Child Health Challenges.\\" Nature Neuroscience 9.10 (Oct. 2006): PsycINFO.

At that time, the cause of birth defects was unknown; only the effects were visible. In 1976, the organization changed its name to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. Reducing the toll of premature birth was added as a mission objective in 2005. Initiatives after polio =Rubella= Rubella, also called German measles, is associated with a disorder called congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause miscarriages and birth defects such as deafness, blindness and mental retardation. Vaccination is an effective preventive measure. On behalf of the March of Dimes, Virginia Apgar testified to the United States Senate in 1969 about the importance of federal funding of a rubella immunization program, and the organization funded a vaccine, which was licensed in the early 1970s. In 2006, a statement published in Birth Defects Research Part A credited the \\"remarkable success of the immunization program to eliminate rubella is due to joint efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, various state and local health departments, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the March of Dimes\\". =Maternal and neonatal care= In 1976, the March of Dimes published a report titled Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy (TIOP), and in 1993 they published Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy: The 90s and Beyond (TIOP II). TIOP \\"stratified maternal and neonatal care into 3 levels of complexity and recommended referral of high- risk patients to centers with the personnel and resources needed for their degree of risk and severity of illness.\\" TIOP was published when \\"resources for the most complex care were relatively scarce and concentrated in academic medical centers.\\" TIOP II updated care complexity designations from levels I, II and III to basic, specialty and subspecialty, and the criteria were expanded. In 2001, the March of Dimes introduced a family support program for those with babies in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The program seeks to educate NICU staff to communicate effectively with patients' families. The March of Dimes hosted the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity in October 2009. In December 2010, the March of Dimes released TIOP III, subtitled Enhancing Perinatal Health Through Quality, Safety, and Performance Initiatives. Fetal alcohol syndrome Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is categorized as a group of birth defects ranging from mental retardation to various growth and behavioral problems. The March of Dimes has provided grant funding for FAS research,Caley, Linda, M., Sara Riemer, and Helen, S.

Folic acid The March of Dimes has campaigned for public education on folic acid, a vitamin which can prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly if mothers have enough of it in their body. The March of Dimes has funded polls on folic acid from The Gallup Organization. Analysis of some of the results, said that women aged 18‚Äì24 years had the least awareness regarding folic acid consumption or knowledge about when it should be taken. On the issue, the organization partnered with the Grain Foods Foundation, an industry group, in public education efforts. Prematurity campaign Awareness about preterm birth, which is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, is an organizational goal. According to an editorial in the May 2004 issue of the Journal of the National Medical Association, the original goals of the campaign were to raise awareness of the problem from 35 percent to at least 60 percent and to decrease the rate of premature births by at least 15 percent (from 11.9 percent to 10.1 percent). In 2008, the Prematurity Campaign was extended by the Board of Trustees until 2020, and global targets were set for prematurity prevention. In 2008, the March of Dimes started its annual Premature Birth Report Card, which grades the nation and each individual state on preterm birth rates. Newborn screening March of Dimes states on its website that it supports mandated newborn screening of all babies in all states in the U.S. for at least 30 life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment and reliable testing are available to prevent catastrophic consequences to the child. In 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state's adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. March of Dimes president Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment. According to a presentation at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, individual, state-based March of Dimes chapters work with governors, state legislators, health departments, health professionals, and parents to improve state newborn screening programs and to make comprehensive newborn screening programs available to every newborn throughout the country. In 2005, only 38 percent of infants were born in states that required screening for 21 or more of 29 core conditions recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics; but by 2009, all 50 states and the District of Columbia required screening for 21 or more of these treatable disorders. NICU Family Support March of Dimes introduced the NICU Family Support program in 2001 to provide information and comfort to families during the NICU hospitalization of their newborn and to contribute to NICU staff professional development. Today it operates in 68 hospitals in the United States to serve more than 50,000 families annually. In 2018, March of Dimes released the My NICU Baby app that provides families with information while in the NICU and to help them transition home. =Global Report on Birth Defects= The March of Dimes published its Global Report on Birth Defects in 2006, which estimated birth defects' global burden. =White paper on prematurity= In 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide. This report, which was the first attempt to identify the global scope of premature births and related infant deaths, found that an estimated 13 million infants worldwide are born premature each year and more than one million of them die in their first month of life. Further, premature births account for 9.6 percent of total births and for 28 percent of newborn deaths. The highest rates of premature birth are in Africa, followed by North America (Canada and the United States combined). =March for Babies= Established in 1970, the March for Babies, previously called WalkAmerica, is the largest fundraiser of the year for the March of Dimes, as well as the oldest nationwide charitable walking event. In the decades since, many other organizations have used the walkathon format to help raise money. Funds raised by the event support March of Dimes-sponsored research and other programs to prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality. According to the March of Dimes, March for Babies is held in more than 900 communities across the nation. Every year, 1 million people‚Äîincluding 20,000 company teams, family teams and national sponsors‚Äîparticipate in the event, which has raised more than $1.8 billion since 1970. The March of Dimes states that seventy-six cents of every dollar raised in March for Babies is spent on research and programs to help prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality. The first person to walk for the March of Dimes was John Harrison Finger, a textile worker in High Point, North Carolina. In 1948, his daughter came home from school and asked for a donation for the polio fund. Finger replied that he did not have the money but that he would raise some. In what is thought to be the first walkathon in March of Dimes history, Finger walked 32 miles ‚Äî round trip from High Point to Greensboro ‚Äî and collected a total of $1,700 in a red wagon he pulled behind him. During his lifetime he walked more than 1,000 miles and raised $15,832 to benefit the charity. The March of Dimes formally created its nationwide WalkAmerica drive in 1971, and Finger was named \\"Mr. WalkAmerica\\" in 1983. =Sounds of Pertussis= Once rare in the United States, cases of pertussis (whooping cough) are appearing across the country with greater frequency.\\"'Sounds of Pertussis'\\" Campaign Makes Times Square Pit Stop.\\" PR Newswire US 11 Aug. 2011: Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 21 Dec. 2011. To address this issue, the March of Dimes and Sanofi Pasteur launched a national education campaign in 2010 called \\"Sounds of Pertussis\\" to raise awareness about the seriousness of pertussis and the need for adult vaccination to prevent infecting babies. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a national spokesperson for the campaign. The campaign recently sponsored a song-writing contest called Sound Off About Pertussis, which was won by Maria Bennett with her original song, \\"Give Pertussis a Whooping.\\" =Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait= To combat the state's high prematurity levels, in 2007, the March of Dimes, the Johnson & Johnson Pediatric Institute, and the Kentucky Department for Public Health partnered with six Kentucky hospitals to launch \\"Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait,\\" a health promotion and prematurity prevention initiative intended to reduce the rate of preventable preterm births in targeted areas of Kentucky. Kentucky was chosen as a pilot due to an elevated preterm birth rate greater than the national average that had been steadily increasing over the past few years, its predisposition to adjustable risk factors such as smoking and nutrition, and the commitment and dedication of community leaders. In 2007-2009, the trial programs saw a 6.5% reduction in preterm birth rates. The success of the program in the State of Kentucky led to the development of similar initiatives in New Jersey, Texas, New York, Kansas, and Illinois with upcoming sites in Florida and California. The primary goal of Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait is a 15 percent reduction in the rate of singleton (one baby) preterm births in these targeted areas through increasing knowledge and education regarding factors that increase the risks of preterm birth, influencing change in health care settings and creating new advancements in preventing preterm and low-birth-weight births. Other strategic goals include improving access to prenatal services and lowering the rate of early elective deliveries done before 39 weeks gestation. The Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait initiative was developed based on five core concepts: Partnerships and collaborations, Provider initiatives, Patient support, Public engagement, and Progress measurement. The program encourages providers to educate patients on the risk factors and prevention methods for preterm births, inform women of childbearing age of the challenges of delivering prematurely, and distribute public information regarding the costs of prematurity on society ($26 million annually). Program initiatives and services include progesterone shots given to pregnant women with past histories of preterm births, encouraging folic acid usage and stress management during pregnancy, and developing strategies to eliminate cesarean deliveries and inductions before 39 week's gestation unless medically necessary. The program was implemented as a Best Practice in the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs (AMCHP) in 2015. =Perinatal Data Center= The March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center includes the PeriStats Web site, which provides free access to U.S., state, county, and city maternal and infant health data. Legislation supported *PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress) ‚Äì a bill that would reauthorize research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to preterm birth and take other actions to improve infant mortality rates. *Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. The March of Dimes described the bill as reauthorizing \\"critical federal activities that assist states in improving and expanding their newborn screening programs, supporting parents and provider newborns screening education, and ensuring laboratory quality and surveillance.\\" *State Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization - a bill that supported the continuation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), a program that provides health insurance to 11 million low-income children and pregnant women. In 2007 and 2009, March of Dimes partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association of Children's Hospitals (NACH) on the issue. Notable staff Virginia Apgar, M.D., the creator of the Apgar Score, joined the March of Dimes in 1959 and eventually served as vice president for medical affairs. Criticism and controversy Animal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals. The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible. In his book Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, \\"fighting birth defects\\", which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of \\"breakthrough for babies\\", rather than disbanding. Charity Navigator, an organization that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of charities, has given the organization a rating of two stars (out of four). This is a merged score that attributes both a Financial as well as Accountability & Transparency rating to a non-profit. As of Fiscal Year 2015, Charity Navigator gives a 60.18 out of 100 score for Financial and a 97.00 out of 100 for Accountability & Transparency. This gives the March of Dimes a merged score of 71.76, leading to their two star status. Another criticism has been that President Jennifer Howse's compensation is high. In 2011, the March of Dimes' tax filings reported it as $545,982, and the organization's filings from 2014 reported her salary as $503,692, about 25% higher than the median CEO salary for similarly sized charities.

In molecular biology, biochips are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents. Digital microfluidic biochips have become one of the most promising technologies in many biomedical fields. In a digital microfluidic biochip, a group of (adjacent) cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage, functional operations, as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically. History The development started with early work on the underlying sensor technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the glass pH electrode, invented in 1922 by Hughes.W. S. Hughes, \\"The potential difference between glass and electrolytes in contact with water,\\" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 44, pp. 2860‚Äì2866, 1922 The basic concept of using exchange sites to create permselective membranes was used to develop other ion sensors in subsequent years. For example, a K+ sensor was produced by incorporating valinomycin into a thin membrane.J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor in Handbook of Chemical and Biological Sensors, J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor, eds., ch. Introduction to Chemical and Biological Sensors, pp. 1‚Äì10, Institute of Physics Publishing, Philadelphia, 1996 In 1953, Watson and Crick announced their discovery of the now familiar double helix structure of DNA molecules and set the stage for genetics research that continues to the present day.D. L. Nelson and M. M. Cox, Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Worth Publishers, New York, 2000 The development of sequencing techniques in 1977 by GilbertA. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, \\"A new method for sequencing DNA,\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 74, pp. 560‚Äì564, 1977 and SangerF. Sanger, S. Nicklen, and A. R. Coulson, \\"DNA sequencing with chainterminating inhibitors,\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 74, pp. 5463‚Äì5467, 1977 (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for protein synthesis. This research showed how hybridization of complementary single oligonucleotide strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based. First, in 1983 Kary Mullis invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Secondly in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with fluorescent tags instead of radiolabels,L. M. Smith, J. Z. Sanders, R. J. Kaiser, P. Hughes, C. Dodd, C. R. Connell, C. Heiner, S. B. H. Kent, and L. E. Hood, \\"Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis,\\" Nature 321, pp. 61‚Äì67, 1986 thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically. thumbright300pxFigure 1. Biochips are a platform that require, in addition to microarray technology, transduction and signal processing technologies to output the results of sensing experiments. Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or \\"chip\\") is just one piece of a complete analysis system. Transduction must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, oxidation/reduction, etc.) into a format understandable by a computer (voltage, light intensity, mass, etc.), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, human-readable output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip--from sensing chemistry, to microarraying, to signal processing--require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by Affymetrix. Their \\"GeneChip\\" products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as p53 (a tumor suppressor) and BRCA1 and BRCA2 (related to breast cancer).P. Fortina, D. Graves, C. Stoeckert, Jr., S. McKenzie, and S. Surrey in Biochip Technology, J. Cheng and L. J. Kricka, eds., ch. Technology Options and Applications of DNA Microarrays, pp. 185‚Äì216, Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia, 2001 The chips are produced by using microlithography techniques traditionally used to fabricate integrated circuits (see below). Microarray fabrication 3D Sarfus image of a DNA biochip The microarray--the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors--is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (e.g. silicon or glass) or active, the latter consisting of integrated electronics or micromechanical devices that perform or assist signal transduction. Surface chemistry is used to covalently bind the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a Cartesian grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipettingM. Schena, D. Shalon, R. W. Davis, and P. O. Brown, \\"Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray,\\" Science 270, pp. 467‚Äì470, 1995 or micro-printingG. MacBeath, A. N. Koehler, and S. L. Schreiber, \\"Printing small molecules as microarrays and detecting protein-ligand interactions en masse,\\" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, pp. 7967‚Äì7968, 1999 systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this process results in high manufacturing costs. Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by Affymetrix) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to combinatorially synthesize hundreds of thousands of unique, single- stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one nucleotide at a time.S. P. Fodor, J. L. Read, M. C. Pirrung, L. Stryer, A. T. Lu, and D. Solas, \\"Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical analysis,\\" Science 251, pp. 767‚Äì773, 1991A. C. Pease, D. Solas, E. J. Sullivan, M. T. Cronin, C. P. Holmes, and S. P. Fodor, \\"Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis,\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91, pp. 5022‚Äì5026, 1994 One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15-25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules. As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or \\"encode\\" the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (e.g. fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (i.e. requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position. \\"Random\\" fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is not required, enabling the use of parallelized self- assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched fiber optic cable.F. J. Steemers, J. A. Ferguson, and D. R. Walt, \\"Screening unlabeled DNA targets with randomly-ordered fiber-optic gene arrays,\\" Nature Biotechnology 18, pp. 91‚Äì94, 2000K. L. Michael, L. C. Taylor, S. L. Schultz, and D. R. Walt, \\"Randomly ordered addressable high-density optical sensor arrays,\\" Analytical Chemistry 70, pp. 1242‚Äì1248, 1998 Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated. Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies Microarrays are not limited to DNA analysis; protein microarrays, antibody microarray, chemical compound microarray can also be produced using biochips. Randox Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003. In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the ELISA plate or cuvette as the reaction platform. The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a patient profile. The patient profile can be used in disease screening, diagnosis, monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment. Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required. Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture immunoassays. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that, the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution. In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used. On antibody-antigen binding a chemiluminescence reaction produces light. Detection is by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light. The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes. Biochips are also used in the field of microphysiometry e.g. in skin-on-a-chipAlexander, F., Eggert, S., Wiest, J.: Skin-on-a-chip: Transepithelial electrical resistance and extracellular acidification measurements through an automated air-liquid interface, Genes, 2018, 9/2, 114; doi:10.3390/genes9020114 applications.

Evan Thornley speaking at an Australian Labor Party gathering on the night of the 2006 state election, at which he was a candidate. Evan William Thornley (born 1964), is an Australian entrepreneur. Thornley was founding chair of Per Capita and National Secretary of the Australian Fabian Society. He was a board member of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Chifley Research Centre, was a founding director of GetUp!. Along with his wife, he founded LookSmart, the first Australian dot-com company listed on the NASDAQ. During the dot-com bubble, his stake in the company was worth almost $1 billion, but its value declined 99% as the bubble burst. He is also a co- founder of the Goodstart Consortium - a social enterprise that owns the largest childcare network in the world (formerly called ABC Learning). He was formerly the CEO of Better Place Australia and Global CEO of Better Place LLC, a now-defunct company which intended to supply electric cars and the charging or switching stations to support them. Thornley served in public office for two years as the Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council for the Southern Metropolitan Region, and as Parliamentary Secretary to Premiers Bracks and Brumby. Background and early career Thornley attended Scotch College, Melbourne and is a graduate of the University of Melbourne. He commenced his university studies in 1983 and served in full-time elected student office as President of the Student Representative Council, and then in the National Union of Students in 1987 and 1988. He completed a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1990, and from 1991 to 1995 he was a consultant at McKinsey and Company, a management consultancy firm.  Political career  Elected to the Parliament of Victoria in 2006, he served as Parliamentary Secretary assisting the Premier on the National Reform Agenda and Innovation until his resignation on 31 December 2008. He is a noted donor to various progressive causes, including the Australian Labor Party. On 28 December 2008, Thornley announced that he would resign from the Victorian Parliament, despite speculation that he would be chosen to serve as a minister in John Brumby's government. His resignation was received angrily by some Labor colleagues who thought his decision \\"insulting\\" and a \\"disgrace.\\" He had been appointed as the CEO of Australian operations for Better Place, a company promoting electric cars. A joint sitting of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council of the Victorian Parliament was required to select a new member to fill the vacancy caused by Thornley's resignation. It was the first casual vacancy to occur since the reform of the Legislative Council in 2006. Under the new rules, which mirror those of the Australian Senate, if the vacating MLC had been elected as a member of a political party, the joint sitting must select a person nominated by that political party. On 30 January 2009, it was announced that Melbourne lawyer Jennifer Huppert had been nominated by the ALP to fill the upper house vacancy.  Post-political career  Having served as the Australian head of Better Place since his resignation from parliament, Thornley was elevated to global CEO of the company following the sacking in October 2012 of its founder and major spokesperson Shai Agassi. However Thornley severed his connection with Better Place only three months later. Since January 2014 he has been executive chair of Same Business Different Outcome (SBDO), a private equity firm.  Connection to Israel, Judaism  Thornley first went to Israel on a Young Political Leaders' Tour while at University and was part of a pro-Israel group humorously dubbed \\"the Mossad faction\\". He led an Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce trade mission to Israel in 2008 and has been a delegate to the Australia Israel Leadership Forum several times. He was Secretary of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel and visited Israel over 30 times during his tenure at Better Place. He was a member of the strategic review panel for the Rabbinical Council of Victoria. Thornley began a formal process of converting to Judaism in 2012 under Rabbi Adam Stein at Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne's only Conservative synagogue. Thornley formally completed the conversion process on 19 August 2014 and adopted the Hebrew name of \\"Lev Yonatan\\".

The term is unique to the United States and is generally not used in other English-speaking countries, which initially used proprietary names such as \\"Ballistite\\" and \\"Cordite\\" but gradually shifted to \\"propellant\\" as the generic term. Smokeless powder was invented in 1884. The basis of the term \\"smokeless\\" is that the combustion products are mainly gaseous, compared to around 55% solid products (mostly potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and potassium sulfide) for black powder.Hatcher, Julian S. and Barr, Al Handloading Hennage Lithograph Company (1951) p.34 Despite its name, smokeless powder is not completely free of smoke;Fairfield, A. P., CDR USN Naval Ordnance Lord Baltimore Press (1921) while there may be little noticeable smoke from small-arms ammunition, smoke from artillery fire can be substantial. This article focuses on nitrocellulose formulations, but the term smokeless powder was also used to describe various picrate mixtures with nitrate, chlorate, or dichromate oxidizers during the late 19th century, before the advantages of nitrocellulose became evident.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls Since the 14th centurysee gunpowder gunpowder was not actually a physical \\"powder\\", and smokeless powder can be produced only as a pelletized or extruded granular material. Smokeless powder allowed the development of modern semi- and fully automatic firearms and lighter breeches and barrels for artillery. Burnt gunpowder leaves a thick, heavy fouling that is hygroscopic and causes rusting of the barrel. The fouling left by smokeless powder exhibits none of these properties (though some primer compounds can leave hygroscopic salts that have a similar effect; non-corrosive primer compounds were introduced in the 1920s). This makes an autoloading firearm with many moving parts feasible (which would otherwise jam or seize under heavy black powder fouling). Smokeless powders are classified as, typically, division 1.3 explosives under the UN Recommendations on the transportation of Dangerous goods ‚Äì Model Regulations, regional regulations (such as ADR) and national regulations. However, they are used as solid propellants; in normal use, they undergo deflagration rather than detonation. Background Before the widespread introduction of smokeless powder the use of gunpowder or black powder caused many problems on the battlefield. Military commanders since the Napoleonic Wars reported difficulty with giving orders on a battlefield obscured by the smoke of firing. Verbal commands could not be heard above the noise of the guns, and visual signals could not be seen through the thick smoke from the gunpowder used by the guns. Unless there was a strong wind, after a few shots, soldiers using gunpowder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke. Snipers or other concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. Gunpowder is a low explosive that does not detonate but rather deflagrates (burns quickly at subsonic speed). Gunpowder produces lower pressures and is about three times less powerful when compared to smokeless powder.Black Powder vs. Smokeless Powder  Comparing Gunpowder Types, Bob Shell, Tuesday, October 13, 2015 Gunpowder is also corrosive, making cleaning mandatory after every use. Likewise, gunpowder's tendency to produce severe fouling causes actions to jam and often makes reloading difficult.  Nitroglycerine and guncotton  Nitroglycerine was synthesized by the Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero in 1847. It was subsequently developed and manufactured by Alfred Nobel as an industrial explosive, but even then it was unsuitable as a propellant: despite its energetic and smokeless qualities, it detonates instead of deflagrating smoothly, making it more liable to shatter a gun, rather than propel a projectile out of it. Nitroglycerine is also highly sensitive, making it unfit to be carried in battlefield conditions. A major step forward was the invention of guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, by German chemist Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosiveDavis, William C., Jr. Handloading National Rifle Association of America (1981) and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was once again somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall & Sons began manufacture in Faversham. English interest languished after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellent, but it too was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using black powder would reach the end of their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton. Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton. After one of the Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice & Company began manufacturing guncotton in Stowmarket in 1863; and British War Office chemist Sir Frederick Abel began thorough research at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865 when the second Austrian guncotton factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of guncotton for torpedo and mine warheads. Propellant improvements In 1863, Prussian artillery captain Johann F. E. Schultze patented a small-arms propellent of nitrated hardwood impregnated with saltpeter or barium nitrate. Prentice received an 1866 patent for a sporting powder of nitrated paper manufactured at Stowmarket, but ballistic uniformity suffered as the paper absorbed atmospheric moisture. In 1871, Frederick Volkmann received an Austrian patent for a colloided version of Schultze powder called Collodin, which he manufactured near Vienna for use in sporting firearms. Austrian patents were not published at the time, and the Austrian Empire considered the operation a violation of the government monopoly on explosives manufacture and closed the Volkmann factory in 1875. In 1882, the Explosives Company at Stowmarket patented an improved formulation of nitrated cotton gelatinised by ether-alcohol with nitrates of potassium and barium. These propellants were suitable for shotguns but not rifles,Hogg, Oliver F. G. Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline (1969) because rifling results in resistance to a smooth expansion of the gas, which is reduced in smoothbore shotguns. An extruded stick powder In 1884, Paul Vieille invented a smokeless powder called Poudre B (short for poudre blanche‚Äîwhite powder, as distinguished from black powder) made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble nitrocellulose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. This was adopted for the Lebel rifle. It was passed through rollers to form paper thin sheets, which were cut into flakes of the desired size. The resulting propellant, today known as pyrocellulose, contains somewhat less nitrogen than guncotton and is less volatile. A particularly good feature of the propellant is that it will not detonate unless it is compressed, making it very safe to handle under normal conditions. Vieille's powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns because it gave off almost no smoke and was three times more powerful than black powder. Higher muzzle velocity meant a flatter trajectory and less wind drift and bullet drop, making shots practicable. Since less powder was needed to propel a bullet, the cartridge could be made smaller and lighter. This allowed troops to carry more ammunition for the same weight. Also, it would burn even when wet. Black powder ammunition had to be kept dry and was almost always stored and transported in watertight cartridges. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being Germany and Austria, which introduced new weapons in 1888. Subsequently, Poudre B was modified several times with various compounds being added and removed. Krupp began adding diphenylamine as a stabilizer in 1888. Meanwhile, in 1887, Alfred Nobel obtained an English patent for a smokeless gunpowder he called Ballistite. In this propellant the fibrous structure of cotton (nitro-cellulose) was destroyed by a nitroglycerine solution instead of a solvent. In England in 1889, a similar powder was patented by Hiram Maxim, and in the United States in 1890 by Hudson Maxim.' ‚Äì Manufacture of explosive ‚Äì H. S. Maxim Ballistite was patented in the United States in 1891. The Germans adopted ballistite for naval use in 1898, calling it WPC/98. The Italians adopted it as filite, in cord instead of flake form, but realising its drawbacks changed to a formulation with nitroglycerine they called solenite. In 1891 the Russians tasked the chemist Mendeleev with finding a suitable propellant. He created nitrocellulose gelatinised by ether-alcohol, which produced more nitrogen and more uniform colloidal structure than the French use of nitro-cottonssmokeless powder in Poudre B. He called it pyrocollodion. Close-up of Cordite filaments in a .303 British rifle cartridge (manufactured in 1964) Britain conducted trials on all the various types of propellant brought to their attention, but were dissatisfied with them all and sought something superior to all existing types. In 1889, Sir Frederick Abel, James Dewar and Dr W Kellner patented (Nos 5614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) a new formulation that was manufactured at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey. It entered British service in 1891 as Cordite Mark 1. Its main composition was 58% nitroglycerine, 37% guncotton and 3% mineral jelly. A modified version, Cordite MD, entered service in 1901, with the guncotton percentage increased to 65% and nitroglycerine reduced to 30%. This change reduced the combustion temperature and hence erosion and barrel wear. Cordite's advantages over gunpowder were reduced maximum pressure in the chamber (hence lighter breeches, etc.) but longer high pressure. Cordite could be made in any desired shape or size. The creation of cordite led to a lengthy court battle between Nobel, Maxim, and another inventor over alleged British patent infringement. The Anglo-American Explosives Company began manufacturing its shotgun powder in Oakland, New Jersey in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called Indurite, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started loading sporting cartridges with Explosives Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing a mixture of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as Peyton Powder, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine-nitrocellulose Ruby powders, Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce Ballistite, and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected Ruby and Peyton Powders as the most suitable for use in the Krag-J√∏rgensen service rifle. Ruby was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the Peyton Powder. Rather than paying the required royalties for Ballistite, Laflin & Rand financed Leonard's reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908. In 1897, United States Navy Lieutenant John Bernadou patented a nitrocellulose powder colloided with ether-alcohol. The Navy licensed or sold patents for this formulation to DuPont and the California Powder Works while retaining manufacturing rights for the Naval Powder Factory, Indian Head, Maryland constructed in 1900. The United States Army adopted the Navy single-base formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal. By that time Laflin & Rand had taken over the American Powder Company to protect their investment, and Laflin & Rand had been purchased by DuPont in 1902. Upon securing a 99-year lease of the Explosives Company in 1903, DuPont enjoyed use of all significant smokeless powder patents in the United States, and was able to optimize production of smokeless powder. When government anti-trust action forced divestiture in 1912, DuPont retained the nitrocellulose smokeless powder formulations used by the United States military and released the double-base formulations used in sporting ammunition to the reorganized Hercules Powder Company. These newer and more powerful propellants were more stable and thus safer to handle than Poudre B. Chemical formulations  Currently, propellants using nitrocellulose (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.10) (typically an ether-alcohol colloid of nitrocellulose) as the sole explosive propellant ingredient are described as single-base powder. Propellants mixtures containing nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.54) as explosive propellant ingredients are known as double-base powder. Alternatively diethylene glycol dinitrate (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.17) can be used as a nitroglycerin replacement when reduced flame temperatures without sacrificing chamber pressure are of importance. Reduction of flame temperature significantly reduces barrel erosion and hence wear. During the 1930s, triple-base propellant containing nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin or diethylene glycol dinitrate, and a substantial quantity of nitroguanidine (detonation velocity , RE factor 0.95) as explosive propellant ingredients was developed. These \\"cold propellant\\" mixtures have reduced flash and flame temperature without sacrificing chamber pressure compared to single- and double-base propellants, albeit at the cost of more smoke. In practice, triple base propellants are reserved mainly for large caliber ammunition such as used in (naval) artillery and tank guns. During World War II, it had some use by British artillery. After that war it became the standard propellant in all British large caliber ammunition designs except small-arms. Most western nations, except the United States, followed a similar path. In the late 20th century new propellant formulations started to appear. These are based on nitroguanidine and high explosives of the RDX type (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.60). Detonation velocities are of limited value in assessing the reaction rates of nitrocellulose propellants formulated to avoid detonation. Although the slower reaction is often described as burning because of similar gaseous end products at elevated temperatures, the decomposition differs from combustion in an oxygen atmosphere. Conversion of nitrocellulose propellants to high-pressure gas proceeds from the exposed surface to the interior of each solid particle in accordance with Piobert's law. Studies of solid single- and double-base propellant reactions suggest reaction rate is controlled by heat transfer through the temperature gradient across a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a foam zone. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding fizz zone. Energy is released in a luminous outer flame zone where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide. The foam zone acts as an insulator slowing the rate of heat transfer from the flame zone into the unreacted solid. Reaction rates vary with pressure; because the foam allows less effective heat transfer at low pressure, with greater heat transfer as higher pressures compress the gas volume of that foam. Propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may fail to sustain the flame zone at lower pressures. Instability and stabilization Nitrocellulose deteriorates with time, yielding acidic byproducts. Those byproducts catalyze the further deterioration, increasing its rate. The released heat, in case of bulk storage of the powder, or too large blocks of solid propellant, can cause self-ignition of the material. Single-base nitrocellulose propellants are hygroscopic and most susceptible to degradation; double-base and triple-base propellants tend to deteriorate more slowly. To neutralize the decomposition products, which could otherwise cause corrosion of metals of the cartridges and gun barrels, calcium carbonate is added to some formulations. To prevent buildup of the deterioration products, stabilizers are added. Diphenylamine is one of the most common stabilizers used. Nitrated analogs of diphenylamine formed in the process of stabilizing decomposing powder are sometimes used as stabilizers themselves. The stabilizers are added in the amount of 0.5‚Äì2% of the total amount of the formulation; higher amounts tend to degrade its ballistic properties. The amount of the stabilizer is depleted with time. Propellants in storage should be periodically tested for the amount of stabilizer remaining, as its depletion may lead to auto-ignition of the propellant. Physical variations Ammunition handloading powders Smokeless powder may be corned into small spherical balls or extruded into cylinders or strips with many cross-sectional shapes (strips with various rectangular proportions, single or multi-hole cylinders, slotted cylinders) using solvents such as ether. These extrusions can be cut into short (\\"flakes\\") or long pieces (\\"cords\\" many inches long). Cannon powder has the largest pieces. The properties of the propellant are greatly influenced by the size and shape of its pieces. The specific surface area of the propellant influences the speed of burning, and the size and shape of the particles determine the specific surface area. By manipulation of the shape it is possible to influence the burning rate and hence the rate at which pressure builds during combustion. Smokeless powder burns only on the surfaces of the pieces. Larger pieces burn more slowly, and the burn rate is further controlled by flame-deterrent coatings that retard burning slightly. The intent is to regulate the burn rate so that a more or less constant pressure is exerted on the propelled projectile as long as it is in the barrel so as to obtain the highest velocity. The perforations stabilize the burn rate because as the outside burns inward (thus shrinking the burning surface area) the inside is burning outward (thus increasing the burning surface area, but faster, so as to fill up the increasing volume of barrel presented by the departing projectile). Fast-burning pistol powders are made by extruding shapes with more area such as flakes or by flattening the spherical granules. Drying is usually performed under a vacuum. The solvents are condensed and recycled. The granules are also coated with graphite to prevent static electricity sparks from causing undesired ignitions. Faster-burning propellants generate higher temperatures and higher pressures, however they also increase wear on gun barrels. Smokeless propellant components The propellant formulations may contain various energetic and auxiliary components: * Propellants ** Nitrocellulose, an energetic component of most smokeless propellantsCampbell, John Naval Weapons of World War Two (1985 ** Nitroglycerin, an energetic component of double-base and triple-base formulations ** Nitroguanidine, a component of triple-base formulations ** DINA (bis-nitroxyethylnitramine; diethanolamine dinitrate, DEADN; DHE) ** Fivonite (2,2,5,5-tetramethylol-cyclopentanone tetranitrate, CyP) ** DGN (diethylene glycol dinitrate) ** Acetyl cellulose * Deterrents, (or moderants), to slow the burning rate ** Centralites (symmetrical diphenyl urea‚Äîprimarily diethyl or dimethyl)Davis, Tenny L. The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives (1943) ** Dibutyl phthalate ** Dinitrotoluene (toxic and carcinogenic) ** Akardite (asymmetrical diphenyl urea) ** ortho-Tolyl urethane ** Polyester adipate ** Camphor (obsolete) * Stabilizers, to prevent or slow down self-decomposition ** Diphenylamine ** Petroleum jelly ** Calcium carbonate ** Magnesium oxide ** Sodium bicarbonate ** beta-Naphthol methyl ether ** Amyl alcohol (obsolete) ** Aniline (obsolete) * Decoppering additives, to hinder the buildup of copper residues from the gun barrel rifling ** Tin metal and compounds (e.g., tin dioxide) ** Bismuth metal and compounds (e.g., bismuth trioxide, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth antimonide); the bismuth compounds are favored as copper dissolves in molten bismuth, forming brittle and easily removable alloy ** Lead foil and lead compounds, phased out due to toxicity * Flash reducers, to reduce the brightness of the muzzle flash (all have a disadvantage: the production of smoke) ** Potassium chloride ** Potassium nitrate ** Potassium sulfate ** Potassium bitartrate (potassium hydrogen tartrate) (a byproduct of wine production formerly used by French artillery) * Wear reduction additives, to lower the wear of the gun barrel liners ** Wax ** Talc ** Titanium dioxide ** Polyurethane jackets over the powder bags, in large guns * Other additives ** Ethyl acetate, a solvent for manufacture of spherical powder ** Rosin, a surfactant to hold the grain shape of spherical powder ** Graphite, a lubricant to cover the grains and prevent them from sticking together, and to dissipate static electricity Manufacturing The United States Navy manufactured single-base tubular powder for naval artillery at Indian Head, Maryland, beginning in 1900. Similar procedures were used for United States Army production at Picatinny Arsenal beginning in 1907 and for manufacture of smaller grained Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powders after 1914. Short-fiber cotton linter was boiled in a solution of sodium hydroxide to remove vegetable waxes, and then dried before conversion to nitrocellulose by mixing with concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids. Nitrocellulose still resembles fibrous cotton at this point in the manufacturing process, and was typically identified as pyrocellulose because it would spontaneously ignite in air until unreacted acid was removed. The term guncotton was also used; although some references identify guncotton as a more extensively nitrated and refined product used in torpedo and mine warheads prior to use of TNT. Unreacted acid was removed from pyrocellulose pulp by a multistage draining and water washing process similar to that used in paper mills during production of chemical woodpulp. Pressurized alcohol removed remaining water from drained pyrocellulose prior to mixing with ether and diphenylamine. The mixture was then fed through a press extruding a long tubular cord form to be cut into grains of the desired length. Alcohol and ether were then evaporated from \\"green\\" powder grains to a remaining solvent concentration between 3 percent for rifle powders and 7 percent for large artillery powder grains. Burning rate is inversely proportional to solvent concentration. Grains were coated with electrically conductive graphite to minimize generation of static electricity during subsequent blending. \\"Lots\\" containing more than ten tonnes of powder grains were mixed through a tower arrangement of blending hoppers to minimize ballistic differences. Each blended lot was then subjected to testing to determine the correct loading charge for the desired performance. Military quantities of old smokeless powder were sometimes reworked into new lots of propellants. Through the 1920s Fred Olsen worked at Picatinny Arsenal experimenting with ways to salvage tons of single-base cannon powder manufactured for World War I. Olsen was employed by Western Cartridge Company in 1929 and developed a process for manufacturing spherical smokeless powder by 1933.Matunas, E. A. Winchester-Western Ball Powder Loading Data Olin Corporation (1978) p.3 Reworked powder or washed pyrocellulose can be dissolved in ethyl acetate containing small quantities of desired stabilizers and other additives. The resultant syrup, combined with water and surfactants, can be heated and agitated in a pressurized container until the syrup forms an emulsion of small spherical globules of the desired size. Ethyl acetate distills off as pressure is slowly reduced to leave small spheres of nitrocellulose and additives. The spheres can be subsequently modified by adding nitroglycerine to increase energy, flattening between rollers to a uniform minimum dimension, coating with phthalate deterrents to retard ignition, and/or glazing with graphite to improve flow characteristics during blending.Wolfe, Dave Propellant Profiles Volume 1 Wolfe Publishing Company (1982) pages 136‚Äì137 Modern smokeless powder is produced in the United States by St. Marks Powder, Inc. owned by General Dynamics.General Dynamics Commercial Powder Applications. Flashless propellant Muzzle flash is the light emitted in the vicinity of the muzzle by the hot propellant gases and the chemical reactions that follow as the gases mix with the surrounding air. Before projectiles exit, a slight pre-flash may occur from gases leaking past the projectiles. Following muzzle exit, the heat of gases is usually sufficient to emit visible radiation ‚Äì the primary flash. The gases expand but as they pass through the Mach disc, they are re-compressed to produce an intermediate flash. Hot, combustible gases (e.g. hydrogen and carbon-monoxide) may follow when they mix with oxygen in the surrounding air to produce the secondary flash, the brightest. The secondary flash does not usually occur with small arms.Moss G. M., Leeming D. W., Farrar C. L. Military Ballisitcs (1969) Nitrocellulose contains insufficient oxygen to completely oxidize its carbon and hydrogen. The oxygen deficit is increased by addition of graphite and organic stabilizers. Products of combustion within the gun barrel include flammable gasses like hydrogen and carbon monoxide. At high temperature, these flammable gasses will ignite when turbulently mixed with atmospheric oxygen beyond the muzzle of the gun. During night engagements, the flash produced by ignition can reveal the location of the gun to enemy forces and cause temporary night-blindness among the gun crew by photo-bleaching visual purple.Milner p.68 Flash suppressors are commonly used on small arms to reduce the flash signature, but this approach is not practical for artillery. Artillery muzzle flash up to from the muzzle has been observed, and can be reflected off clouds and be visible for distances up to . For artillery, the most effective method is a propellant that produces a large proportion of inert nitrogen at relatively low temperatures that dilutes the combustible gases. Triple based propellants are used for this because of the nitrogen in the nitroguanidine. Before the use of triple based propellants, the usual method of flash reduction was to add inorganic salts like potassium chloride so their specific heat capacity might reduce the temperature of combustion gasses and their finely divided particulate smoke might block visible wavelengths of radiant energy of combustion.

This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., & Akert, R. (2010). Social psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall. This effect has been researched by many psychologists and linked to many theories related to group conflict and prejudice. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a social psychology standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups. These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behavior, increasing covariation. This then incentivizes in-group bias. Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are realistic conflict theory and social identity theory. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for positively distinct social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior. Origins of the research tradition In 1906, the sociologist William Sumner posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how \\"each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders\\". This is seen on the group level with ingroup‚Äìoutgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, ethnic groups, or nations, it is referred to as ethnocentrism. Explanations =Competition= Realistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel. The boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued.Sherif, M.; Harvey, O.J.; White, B.J.; Hood, W. & Sherif, C.W. (1961). Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155‚Äì184. Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups. Sherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arise when groups compete for limited resources. However, he also theorized that inter-group frictions could be reduced and positive relations created, but only in the presence of an over-arching goal, which could only be achieved with the two groups' cooperation. =Self- esteem= According to social identity theory, one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve self-esteem. The desire to view one's self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one's own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light. That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by Henri Tajfel, a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created minimal groups (see minimal group paradigm), which occur when \\"complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable\\". In Tajfel's studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that‚Äîregardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which \\"style\\" they like better‚Äîparticipants almost always \\"liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities\\". By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in- group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group. Robert Cialdini and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss. In another set of studies, done in the 1980s by Jennifer Crocker and colleagues using the minimal group paradigm, individuals with high self-esteem who suffered a threat to the self-concept exhibited greater ingroup biases than did people with low self-esteem who suffered a threat to the self-concept. While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self- esteem and in-group bias, other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem showed more bias toward both in-group and out-group members. Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed more bias than did lower self-esteem groups. This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (global personal self- esteem rather than specific social self-esteem). = Biological basis as an effect of oxytocin = In a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by Carsten De Dreu, the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics‚Äîcategorized as 'in-group' members‚Äîpromoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals. This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odds of survival for members of said group. Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression. This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain. Oxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit in-group members. = Self- identity and social identity = As noted in two recent theoretical reviews, the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory and its extension, self-categorization theory. According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g., sex, class, team) two processes come into play: (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between the in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including the self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences. More specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group- related or personal characteristics influence a person's feelings and actions. If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behavior through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behavior if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviorally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people's behavior and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms. On the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in a person's social role. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner for the sake of filling in roles in society. People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized, or may be facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one's identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them. Identity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others. For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that does not work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies. Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she won't care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies. Because people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished. In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced. This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.  Evolution of in-groups  = Formation of cultural groups = Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of cultural groups. Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in- group favoritism. Efferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilizing a series of coordination games to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behavior and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favoritism occurred in ensuing social interactions. Participants were first divided into one of several populations of 10 people, and then further divided into subpopulations of 5. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of 2 choices, behavior A or behavior B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the 2nd group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis- coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched. The experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivized to develop a sense of expected behaviors in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviors were not in-line with social norms. The results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behavior with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, covariation (of marker and behavior) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same- shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favoritism. Their study supported the hypothesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioral traits being advantageous. Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilizations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioral norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.  Gender differences  = Automatic bias for own gender = Rudman and Goodwin conducted research on gender bias that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at Purdue and Rutgers University participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men. This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender. = Competition = Using a publics-goods game, Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women's contributions. = Ethnicity-based favoritism = In 2001 Fershtman and Gneezy found that men showed in-group biases in a \\"trust\\" game based on ethnicity, whereas this tendency was not present in women. The study aims to identify ethnic discrimination in Israeli Jewish society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participant's name was typically ethnically Eastern or Ashkenazic. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 NIS) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back. The experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men. Furthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names. This result may seem counter-intuitive, as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male. Thus, we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalized, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women. =Developmental age = In 2008 Fehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach, in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favoritism from ages 3‚Äì8, whereas girls did not display such tendencies. The experiment involved usage of an \\"envy game\\", a modified version of the dictator game. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis. They theorized that parochialism and favoring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts. As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favored a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.  Real-world examples  = 2008 US Presidential elections = A study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic. The study was carried out among 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics dictator game. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous, apart from which candidate they supported in the Democratic Primaries. Data were collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18 (after Hillary Clinton's concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14, before the Democratic National Convention on the 25; and September 2 to 5, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favoritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias, however, was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favoritism throughout. The experiment suggested that group identities are flexible and can change over time. Researchers theorized that in-group bias was strong in June, as the competition to be the Democratic nominee in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the Republicans) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August. Only in September did the in-group favoritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present. = Wikipedia = Research analyzing articles about 35 inter-group conflicts (e.g., Falklands War) by comparing the corresponding language versions of Wikipedia (e.g., English, Spanish) found evidence for in-group favoritism: While the \\"in-group\\" was systematically preferred and presented in a more favorable light, the \\"out-group\\" was presented as more immoral and more responsible for the conflict. There were substantial variations between conflicts, however, and additional analyses revealed in-group favoritism to be more pronounced in more recent conflicts and in articles written predominantly by \\"in-group\\" members.  Versus out- group negativity  Social psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup. Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity. For example, Struch and Schwartz found support for the predictions of belief congruence theory. The belief congruence theory concerns itself with the degree of similarity in beliefs, attitudes, and values perceived to exist between individuals. This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to racial discrimination, the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial discrimination than does race itself. Research finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations and judicial decisions. = Biological relationship = Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense- motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out- group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics. Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific \\"home\\" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries. In-group derogation Cross-cultural studies have found that in- group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one's own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to Ma-Kellams, Spencer-Rodgers and Peng, system justification theory seeks to explain why \\"minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group\\". They said their research into in- group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances. Ma-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as East Asian cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders. Social identity theory and Freudian theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative self-image, which they believe is then extended to the group. Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that \\"ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians\\" as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally- ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures' in-group derogation, due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.

Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. Whyte's major work to date is a series of historical novels retelling the story of King Arthur against the backdrop of Roman Britain. This version of the popular legend eschews the use of magic to explain Arthur's ascent to power and instead relies on the historical condition (with some artistic licence) of post-Roman Britain to support the theory that Arthur was meant to counter the anarchy left by the Roman departure from Britain in 410 AD and the subsequent colonization and invasion of Britain by various peoples from Northwestern Europe, including the Saxons, Jutes, Franks, and Angles. Whyte incorporates both traditional Arthurian names, places and events (albeit in Gaelic or Latin form) as well as the names of various historical figures that have been suggested as being the possible basis for the original King Arthur legend. The tacit implication is that Whyte's version of history is the true story that has become distorted over time to become the legend and stories of magic that we know today. The series has been published in different locations under three different titles. In Canada it was titled A Dream of Eagles; in the United States it was retitled The Camulod Chronicles, and when it was eventually republished in Great Britain with a different reading order, it became Legends of Camelot. Jack Whyte served as the official bard of The Calgary Highlanders and performed several tracks of poetry and song on the 1990 recording by the Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders entitled Eighty Years of Glory: The Regimental Pipes, Drums and Bard of The Calgary Highlanders.

It serves to answer questions left open by The Eagles' Brood that result from the fact that the latter is told exclusively from the perspective of Merlyn Britannicus and as such is not able to explain actions and events of which Merlyn is unaware. Uther is also a companion novel to The Eagles' Brood as it follows the title character and others as they grow up and wage war on Uther's main enemy, Guhlrys Lot, King of Cornwall. =British editions= When the series was first published in Great Britain in 2013 and 2014, the books were retitled as indicated above, placed in a different order, and organized into several sub-series. The Saxon Shore and the two parts of The Sorcerer became the first sub-series, Arthur the Hero; Clothar the Frank and The Eagle became the second sub-series, Arthur the King; The Eagles' Brood and Uther became the third sub-series, Arthur the Son; and The Skystone and The Singing Sword became the fourth and final sub-series, Arthur the Dynast. The British editions thus came close to reversing the internal chronological and publication orders of the series.

Displayed on the auto show circuit in 1955, the Futura was modified by George Barris into the Batmobile, for the 1966 TV series Batman. History The car's official public debut was on January 8, 1955 at the Chicago Auto Show;‚ÄúTwo Lincoln- Mercury Firsts at the Chicago Auto Show: World Premiere of the Lincoln Futura‚Äù (display ad). January 9, 1955. it had been shown to the press at the city's Congress Hotel on January 5.‚ÄúExperimental Car Will Be Seen at Show‚Äù Chicago Tribune, January 6, 1955. While being displayed elsewhere in the U.S. that spring, the Futura was seen by the country's television audience on Today (\\"The Today Show\\") on March 3, 1955.‚ÄúRadio-TV.‚Äù Buffalo Courier-Express, March 3, 1955. The Futura's styling was original by 1950s standards -- with a double, clear-plastic canopy top, exaggerated hooded headlight pods, and very large, outward-canted tailfins.\\"Lincoln Shows Its Idea Automobile.\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1955, p. 95. Nevertheless, the Futura had a complete powertrain and was fully operable, in contrast to many show cars. Its original color was white, and was one of the first pearlescent color treatments, using ground pearl to achieve the paint effect. The Futura was powered by a 368 cubic inch Lincoln engine and powertrain; the chassis derived from a Continental Mark II. The Futura was a success as a show car, garnering favorable publicity for Ford. It was released as a model kit and a toy, and, in a much more subdued form, its headlight and tailfin motifs would appear on production Lincolns for 1956 and 1957, such as the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Capri. The concave front grille inspired the grille on the 1960 Mercury Monterey and the 1960 Ford Galaxie. Media appearances The Futura played a prominent part in the 1959 movie It Started with a Kiss, starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford. For the movie, it was painted red, as the white pearlescent finish did not photograph well.1955 Lincoln Futura in It Started with a Kiss, Movie, 1959 at the Internet Movie Car Database The red- painted car is also seen in Ford's 1961 promotional film \\"The Secret Door.\\" The film's looking inside Ford's Styling Center includes footage of the Futura on the test track and in the wind tunnel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r7wy1k97oo The concept car was subsequently sold to auto customizer George Barris. Having originally cost $250,000, the Futura was sold to Barris for $1.00 and \\"other valuable consideration\\" by Ford Motor Company. As the car was never titled and was therefore uninsurable, it was parked behind Barris' shop, sitting idle and deteriorating for several years. The Lincoln Futura was also included in DLC: Vegas Pack of Mafia II as \\"Jefferson Futura\\". The 1994 NBC TV series VIPER featured a red 1955 Lincoln Futura called \\"The Baxley\\". Season 1 Episode 8. The cars creator stole it after it was recovered by construction workers. There was quite a bit of film featuring the vehicle. Even a chase between the VIPER Defender and the Futura. There is a youtube video available of the chase. =Batmobile= The Batmobile from the 1960s Batman' TV series In 1966 Barris was asked to design a theme car for the Batman television series.George Barris, David Fetherston, Barris TV and Movie Cars, pages 20-27 (MBI Publishing Company, 1996) Originally the auto stylist Dean Jeffries was contracted to build the car for the show in late 1965, but when the studio wanted the car sooner than he could deliver, the project was given to Barris.St. Antoine, Arthur. - \\"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\\". - Motor Trend Magazine With the short notice, Barris thought the Futura might work well, and using Jeffries's initial car, decided that its unusual winged shape would be an ideal starting point for the Batmobile. Barris hired Bill Cushenberry to modify the car's metalwork. Barris went on to build three fiberglass replicas using the frames and running gear from 1966 Ford Galaxie cars for the show circuit. Barris later acquired a fourth replica, a metal car built on a 1958 Ford Thunderbird. Barris retained ownership of the car after its conversion to the Batmobile, leasing it to the TV studio for filming. After production of the TV series ended, it was displayed in Barris' own museum in California. It has also been displayed in the Cayman Motor Museum on Grand Cayman Island. Barris sold the Batmobile to Rick Champagne at the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction on Saturday, January 19, 2013 in Scottsdale, Arizona for US $4.62 million dollars.  Replica  Bob Butts Replica, as seen in Ohio November 7, 2009 In the 1990s, Bob Butts (with George Barris' consent) made replicas of the Batmobile, using a mold of one of the Barris-built replicas. Based on pictures from when the Futura was shown in the 1950s, he reskinned an existing Batmobile replica back into a Lincoln Futura replica. He only created one copy. The original fiberglass copy shell of the Futura made by Bob Butts was later found by Gotham garage owner Mark Towle and his friend and actor Shawn Pilot and rebuilt as an original copy of the Lincoln Futura together with his team (Constance Nunes, Tony Quinones, Michael \\"Caveman\\" Pyle) in their shop in Temecula, California, as seen in the Netflix series Car Masters: Rust to Riches. After finishing the car the Futura was eventually sold at ‚ÄúThe Grand National Roadster Show‚Äù at Pomona for approximately $90,000 to Keith Dean whose father Dick Dean worked with George Barris. In this deal Mark also sold his just finished International COE Car transport truck for $90,000 and got a 1936 Ford with it from Keith Dean that was also part of the deal. The money they ended up with was $170,000. The Ford's value was around $10,000 without any changes, and with modifications the Ford's value would easy be around the $70,000-80,000.

These vehicles are usually operated by designated agencies which are often part of the government, but also may be non-governmental organizations and commercial companies specifically authorised by law. Emergency vehicles may be exempted from some conventional road rules in order to reach their destinations in the fastest possible time, such as driving through an intersection when the traffic light is red, or exceeding the speed limit. In some states of the United States, however, the driver of an emergency vehicle can still be sued if the driver shows \\"reckless disregard for the safety of others.\\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TN/htm/TN.546.htm Types There are many types of emergency vehicle, dependent on jurisdiction. Some examples of emergency vehicles include: * Law enforcement ** Mobile communications vehicle ** Police bicycle ** Police car ** Police motorcycle ** Police van ** SWAT vehicle * Firefighting ** Fire engine ** Fire car ** Light and air unit ** Water tender * Medical ** Air ambulance ** Ambulance ** Motorcycle ambulance ** Nontransporting EMS vehicle * Other ** Rescue vehicle ** Hazardous materials apparatus ** Tow truck Equipment Many emergency response vehicles (especially those of the main police, fire and ambulance services) are likely to be fitted with audible and visual warning devices, which are designed to facilitate their movement through traffic to reach their destination, and to provide some protection on the scene. Depending on local laws, vehicles on the road may be required to yield the right of way to emergency responders who are using their warning devices. For example, in Utah, when an emergency vehicle is on the road while using its warning devices, all cars are required to pull over to the side of the road, stop, and wait for the vehicle to pass before resuming normal driving, unless doing so would cause an accident or if stopped at a red light/stop sign. Even in areas where no such laws exist, many motorists may allow the vehicle to pass as a matter of courtesy. Summoning assistance In many countries, emergency vehicles are usually dispatched from a center that takes calls from an emergency telephone number, such as 9-1-1, 999, 1-1-1 or 1-1-2. Livery Colour and design choices reflect several needs, but typically may include: * Identification of the service ‚Äì Such as New York State Police or City of Tokyo Fire Department, to which the vehicle belongs and helps identify its purpose to the public and other services. In some areas, the name of the service (\\"ambulance\\", \\"fire\\" etc.) may be written in reverse lettering on the front of the vehicle to provide a view of the approaching vehicle in a rearview mirror. * Vehicle ID number ‚Äì This may be a simple asset tracking number (for maintenance etc.) or may also be the unit number which can be used by the control to identify them. Many vehicles also display their vehicle number on their roof or trunk (boot) lid, to be identifiable from the air. * High visibility markings ‚Äì Responding emergency vehicles want to be conspicuous, as do emergency vehicles parked at a scene (so they do not get hit by other vehicles). Many departments use passive visual warnings such as reflective lettering and/or striping to increase their visibility. Other patterns include checker-board (battenburg) or chevrons. For police departments, there can be a competing need for stealth. Police departments can use minimally marked cars with subdued graphics that blend in with the car's body colour, but they can also use unmarked civilian-like vehicles (typically for detectives, undercover investigators, SWAT, and higher-ranking officers), which may be similar to their marked units, or may be entirely different. * Contact information ‚Äì There may well be a telephone number written on the side of the vehicle which can be called to summon it. Whilst this also applies in areas where there is a single emergency telephone number, it is especially important where a system of local numbers is in place, or where the service is a secondary service (such as a utility company). In some cases, the vehicle may display an internet address for people to go and find more information about the operator.

Agathe Ursula Backer Gr√∏ndahl (1 December 1847 ‚Äì 4 June 1907) was a Norwegian pianist and composer. She married the conductor and singing teacher Olaus Andreas Gr√∏ndahl in 1875, and was generally known thereafter as Agathe Backer Gr√∏ndahl. Her son Fridtjof Backer- Gr√∏ndahl (1885‚Äì1959) was also a pianist and composer, who promoted his mother's compositions in his concerts. Biography Agathe Ursula Backer was born in Holmestrand in 1847, in a wealthy and art-loving home, as the second youngest of four sisters, all gifted in drawing and music. In 1857 she moved with her family to Christiania, where she studied with Otto Winther-Hjelm, Halfdan Kjerulf and Ludvig Mathias Lindeman. Between 1865 and 1867 she became a pupil of Theodor Kullak and studied composition under Richard Wuerst at the Akademie der Tonkunst in Berlin, where she lived together with her sister Harriet Backer. She won fame there with her interpretation of Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" Concerto. In 1868 she debuted with Edvard Grieg, then 26 years old, as conductor of the Philharmonic Society. A recommendation from Ole Bull led to further studies with Hans von B√ºlow in Florence in 1871.Her songs from this early period are in the German Romantic tradition of Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann, but also reflect her own ability to shape a melody and use the piano in a rich manner. Later the same year she played at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, becoming a pupil of Franz Liszt in Weimar in 1873. In 1875 she was married to the celebrated singing teacher Herr Grondahl of Christiania, and during the second half of the 1870s she built up an outstanding pianist career with a series of concerts in the Nordic countries, also playing with very great success in London and Paris. 1898 Music festival in Bergen by Agnes Nyblin. Left to right: Christian Cappelen, Catharinus Elling, Ole Olsen, Gerhard Rosenkrone Schelderup, Iver Holter, Agathe Backer Gr√∏ndahl, Edvard Grieg, Christian Sinding, Johan Svendsen and Johan Halvorsen In 1889 and 1890 she gave concerts in London and Birmingham with a wide-ranging program, including Grieg's piano concerto. After that she was proclaimed one of the century's greatest piano artists by George Bernard Shaw, who also remarked on the sensitiveness, symmetry and artistic economy of her compositions.Shaw, G B. Shaw's Music. ed D. Laurence. The Bodley Head. Vol 1, pp 654-710 At the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889, she repeated her success with her brilliant interpretation of Grieg's piano concerto. It was then that she began suffering from nerve problems, although she eventually resumed her artistic career as a pianist. Later in the 1890s she became almost completely deaf. She gave her last concerts in Sweden and Finland in the autumn of 1901. Then she retired to teaching. = Teaching style = As a teacher she was markedly successful and influential. Her children studied under her and are counted with her gifted pupils. She was the author of many songs and a great deal of music for the piano, and both as pianist and composer stands at the head of modern music in Norway. Agathe Backer Gr√∏ndahl died at her home in Orm√∏ya, outside Christiania, at the age of 59. She is today chiefly remembered for her piano pieces and songs. = Compositional style = Agathe Backer Grondahl played a major role in the period often called the golden age of Norwegian music history. She composed in total some 400 pieces spanning seventy opus numbers, and was a prominent character on the Norwegian musical scene; being a close friend of Edvard Grieg. Her earlier compositions synthesized the predominant pianistic and stylistic ideas of 1850s Europe. In her later years however, her style transformed and anticipated some of the early twentieth century impressionistic ideas, which ultimately led the composer Pauline Hall to call her the first true Norwegian impressionist.

It is Ontario's second busiest freeway by volume and the third busiest in North America, behind Highway 401 and Interstate 405 in California. Like Highway 401, a portion of the route is divided into a collector-express system with twelve to fourteen continuous lanes. Notable about Highway 427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway 401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with Highway 409 and Highway 407 were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively. Highway 427 is the main feeder to Toronto Pearson International Airport from the north and south. However, while much of the traffic from Highway 407, Highway 401 (eastbound), and the QEW/Gardiner Expressway makes use of the freeway for airport access, it also serves as a major traffic route for the western portion of Toronto (Etobicoke), the northeastern portion of Mississauga (Malton), the southeastern portion of Brampton (Claireville), and the western portion of Vaughan (Woodbridge). The section between Highway 401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor; the stretch between Burnhamthorpe and Rathburn saw an average of over 400,000 vehicles and over 5,000 buses per day in 2016. GO Transit, MiWay, and the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) all operate express buses along this section of the highway. First designated in 1972, Highway 427 assumed the recently completed 12-lane collector-express freeway of Highway 27, as well as a short freeway north of Highway 401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway 7 over the following twenty years. Construction is underway to extend Highway 427 north to York Regional Road 25 (Major MacKenzie Drive); construction began in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2021.  Route description  Highway 427 begins at a complicated interchange with the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Gardiner Expressway. Highway 427 is the second-busiest freeway in Canada with an average of 300,000 vehicles that use it between the QEW and Highway 401 per day. The section between Burnhamthorpe Road and Rathburn Road has an annual average daily traffic (AADT) count of 353,100. The route is long. At its southern terminus, the route begins at Coules Court, where it continues as Brown's Line, once the southernmost stretch of Highway 27 . Alderwood Plaza, located on the east side of the route, has a parking lot which provides access to the highway; this is the only at-grade access along the length of the route. The four-lane road splits into a divided highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a complicated interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW/Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps to and from the QEW/Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway 401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges. Highway 427 south of Eglinton Avenue features a collector-express system. After crossing Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks, the freeway interchanges with Dundas Street. A set of criss-crossing ramps provide access between the collector and express lanes north of this point, referred to as \\"The Basketweave.\\" The highway passes beneath Bloor Street West but does not provide direct access. Instead, it provides ramps to parallel arterial roads; The East Mall and The West Mall run parallel with the freeway from Evans Avenue to Rathburn Road. A full interchange is provided shortly after with Burnhamthorpe Road, southwest of Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute. Across from the school, an off-ramp provides access from the southbound lanes to Holiday Drive and The West Mall. Following the off-ramp, to the north, is a partial interchange with Rathburn Road, which provides access from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes. Transfers provide a second and final opportunity to cross between the express and collector lanes, or vice versa, south of the complicated Highway 401 interchange. A final set of ramps along the collector-express system provides access to and from the southbound lanes and Eringate Drive, after which the collector lanes diverge, and the express lanes cross the southbound collector lanes. The collector lanes provide access to and from Eglinton Avenue, then transition into Highway 27, while the express lanes interchange with Highway 401 and continue the route of Highway 427. The Highway 427 express lanes and flyover ramps to and from Highway 401 are constructed around the Richview Memorial Cemetery. Highway 427 passes through the sprawling Highway 401 interchange and becomes displaced approximately to the west. There are no ramps to provide access from southbound Highway 427 to eastbound Highway 401 and vice versa, as this connection is handled by Highway 409. Highway 427 crosses Renforth Drive and then curves to the east of Runway 24R and 24L of Toronto Pearson International Airport. Shortly thereafter, it crosses and interchanges with Dixon Road and Airport Road, between which it forms the demarcation line. Several ramps diverge at this point to provide access to Pearson Airport, and the freeway narrows to eight lanes. From here to just south of Finch Avenue, the freeway follows the boundary line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway 409, which provides access to the airport as well as the southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway 401 to the south. Highway 427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning Star Drive, and Finch Avenue. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga‚ÄìToronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, the highway crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway 407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before ending at Highway 7. The interchange between Highway 427 and Highway 409 was built to its current configuration by 1992.  History  An aerial view, facing north, of the reconstruction of Highway 27 to a four-lane freeway during the early 1950s = QEW to Highway 401 (1953‚Äì1956) = Although Highway 427 was not officially designated until 1972, several sections of freeway were already in place prior to that date. The designation was applied following the completion of the interchanges at the QEW and Highway 401 as well as the expansion of the section between them into a collector-express system. Highway 27 was designated as a two-lane road travelling north from Highway 2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass was designed to be incorporated into the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway 401\\\\. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway 27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue). Construction of the Toronto Bypass began near Yonge Street in 1949 (along present-day Highway 401) and on the four-laning of Highway 27 in 1953. The Highway 27 work involved the construction of two interchanges: a three-way stack at Highway 401 and a large cloverleaf at the QEW, the latter of which would become one of the worst bottlenecks in the province a decade after its completion, according to Minister of Transportation Charles MacNaughton. By September 1956, it was possible to bypass Toronto entirely on the four lane divided highway composed of Highway 401 and Highway 27. Highway 401 was extended to the west soon after,but Highway 27 remained a two-lane highway north of it. An aerial photograph of the Airport Expressway in 1964 = Airport Expressway (1964‚Äì1971) = During the early 1960s, Toronto International Airport was expanded with the construction of the Aeroquay One terminal. To serve the expected demand of the expansion, the DHO built a new four-lane freeway north from Highway 401 at Renforth Drive. This new route, which roughly followed the same route as today's Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Roads where it tied in with and downgraded into Indian Line, was known as the Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964. It featured a connection with the western terminus of Richview Sideroad at the southern end of the interchange with Highway 401 as well as an interchange with Renforth Drive. = Expansion (1963‚Äì1971) = Completed grading on the reconstruction of Highway 27 in 1954. The Highway 401 overpass is visible in the background. In 1963, MacNaughton announced that Highway 401 would be widened from a four-lane highway to a collector-express system, modelled after the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago. Plans were soon developed to apply this model to the QEW between Highway 27 and Royal York Road and to Highway 27 between the QEW and Highway 401, and were unveiled to Etobicoke council on October 13, 1966. Design work followed and was completed by May 1967. This reconstruction once again involved the junctions with the QEW and Highway 401, which were reconfigured into complicated multi-level interchanges to permit free-flow movement; construction began in September 1968. The widening of Highway 27 required the demolition and rebuilding of overpasses at Bloor Street, Burnhamthorpe Road, and Rathburn Road constructed just over a decade earlier. The junction with Highway 27 was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway. Construction began in September 1968, although preliminary work had been ongoing since 1966; the interchange opened to traffic on November 14, 1969. The Semi-directional T junction with the QEW was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway, with the two sets of flyovers (defaulting express lane traffic to the QEW and vice versa) soaring over the collector lanes to Browns Line (plus their connecting ramps to The Queensway and Evans Avenue). The junction with Highway 401 remains the largest interchange in Canada as it sprawls over and required the construction of 28 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway, being built around the existing Richview Memorial Cemetery, and including connections to Eglinton Avenue (ultimately meant for the proposed but never- built municipal Richview Expressway). The interchange with the QEW was opened to traffic on November 14, 1969, while the Highway 401 junction required several more years of construction staging, fully opening on December 4, 1971 (though portions were opened in the weeks prior to that), just prior to Highway 27's renumbering as Highway 427\\\\. The rest of the route was rebuilt prior to the completion of these interchanges. Highway 427 featured an at- grade intersection until 1992, when it was replaced by a flyover ramp. The completed project resulted in the creation of Highway 427 between the QEW and Dixon/Airport Road, north of which traffic was defaulted onto Indian Line. The entire existing Airport Expressway was removed to make way for the new interchange with Highway 401, but its replacement in the form of the Highway 427 extension (also known as the Airport Expressway) still included direct access to the airport. = Extensions beyond Highway 401 (1976‚Äì1994) = A diagram superimposing the Airport Expressway and the current Highway 401‚Äì427 interchange Ultimately, it was planned to extend Highway 427 north along Indian Line (although a stretch of that road would be retained to maintain access to driveways) to the future Highway 407, where ramps would direct northbound traffic onto Highway 27. An extension north of Dixon/Airport Roads began in 1976 as part of the work to build Highway 409, and it included the construction of the interchange between the two freeways. By the beginning of 1980, this work was completed, and construction was progressing on the section north to Rexdale Boulevard, which opened by the end of the year. In 1982, construction began on the next section of Highway 427, which would extend it to south of Albion Road (which was reached via the northernmost stretch of Indian Line) north of the West Humber River. This project included the extension of Finch Avenue west from Humberline Drive to Steeles Avenue and was completed in late 1984. Nearly completed Hwy. 427 widening work as seen from the Morning Star Drive overpass in June 2018As part of the initial phase of Highway 407, Highway 427 was extended north to Highway 7 in Vaughan beginning with the construction of the interchange between the two in 1988. With the interchange only half-completed, the extension was opened in late 1991. By 1994, the final at-grade intersections‚Äîthe first being the left turn from the southbound lanes with eastbound Highway 409 after the completion of that interchange, and the second being at Morning Star Drive, where an overpass was constructed to extend the street across the freeway to Humberwood Boulevard‚Äîwere removed, making Highway 427 a fully controlled-access freeway for its entire length. = Recent construction (2008-2020)= An four-lane arterial road designated as Regional Road 99 was opened in the autumn of 2008 by York Region. This road connected the mainline of Highway 427 to Zenway Boulevard, and mainly served to provide improved access to Highway 27 and Highway 50\\\\. It was closed on August 8, 2020 and slated to be removed when Highway 427 was to be extended north to Highway 25 (Major MacKenzie Drive), and was permanently closed on August 8, 2020. A section of Highway 427 between Campus Road-Fasken Drive and Steeles Avenue is currently being expanded to four lanes in each direction. This project includes the installation of high- mast lighting, median barriers, and the addition of high-occupancy toll lanes in both directions, and is nearing completion as of the spring of 2020. In conjunction with the widening work, and in anticipation of the opening of the extension north of Highway 7, exit numbers are being added.  Future  Highway 427 extension under construction looking south from the Zenway Dr. overpass (construction detour at bottom) in June 2020, and the temporary extension of Hwy. 427; York Regional Rd. 99 (right) An environmental assessment was completed on a northward extension of Highway 427 to Major Mackenzie Drive to relieve traffic issues on Highways 27 and 50, as well as provide improved access to the Canadian Pacific Intermodal Terminal, and construction began in May 2017. The project will include HOT lanes as far north as Rutherford Road. The extension is scheduled to open in 2021, with the HOT lanes opening the following year. The extension is being built by Link 427, a consortium of six companies that tendered the winning bid to Infrastructure Ontario. The project is estimated to cost $616 million, and will include the design, financing, and construction of the extension, as well as its maintenance for thirty years. Construction will require periodic closure of eleven roads, including Regional Road 99 (now permanently closed); McGillivray Road, which will be realigned at Rutherford Road; and the intersection of Huntington Road and Major MacKenzie Drive. There was some consideration to extending Highway 427 farther north towards Barrie and beyond in the early 2000s. Connections with the Bradford Bypass freeway, as well as Highway 400 and Highway 11 north of Barrie were considered. In the past decade, there has been little discussion of this highway extension due to concerns with traversing the Oak Ridges Moraine and Minesing Swamp.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 3, 2011 river in northern Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee. It is of considerable geographic, cultural, and historic significance. In large measure this is because it is the only major river of West Tennessee that has never been impounded, channelized, or otherwise modified by human activity to any major degree, although several of its tributaries have. Its environs are indicative of what much of West Tennessee must have resembled prior to the time of European settlement in early 19th century. The Hatchie River near Bolivar, Tennessee The Hatchie rises in the northern part of Union County, Mississippi and travels through Tippah and Alcorn counties before crossing into Hardeman County, Tennessee, near the community of Pocahontas. After a short jog into adjoining McNairy County, Tennessee, the Hatchie flows north, in a serpentine fashion, then turns northwest toward Bolivar. While there is usually a discernible main channel, the Hatchie at this point is largely a zone of wetlands approximately one mile (1.6 km) wide. Supposedly Bolivar was the head of navigation for small, shallow-draught steamboats in the 19th century. From Bolivar, the Hatchie continues generally northwest, crossing into Haywood County and the southwestern corner of Madison County. it then enters Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge. The rest of the stream course generally trends west. There is a \\"bow\\" to the north in the final part of the stream course, which forms the line between Tipton County and Lauderdale County. The Hatchie enters the Mississippi River just north of the Hatchie Towhead and just south of the Lower Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge.

It is a short freeway used mainly as a spur route bypass for traffic travelling to the airport or Highway 427 northbound from Highway 401 westbound (and vice versa), as these route movements are not accommodated at the complex interchange between Highways 401 and 427. Planning for Highway 409 took place in late 1960s amidst considerable controversy around its originally proposed path through the historic town of Malton. Eventually the route was changed to provide access to the airport instead of more northward towards Brampton and was completed through the mid-1970s, opening in 1978. The significance of the route has increased over the years alongside expansion of the airport. In 2000, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) purchased the section west of Highway 427 in order to modify the ramps leading into the airport. The speed limit along Highway 409 is east of Highway 427 and west of it. It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police east of the Toronto-Peel boundary and by the Peel Regional Police to the west of it. The original name of the freeway was derived from the road running parallel to and north of it, Belfield Road. Belfield is a local road managed by the City of Toronto and runs from Kipling Avenue to Atwell Drive.  Route description  Looking east on the 409 approaching the interchange with Martin Grove Road, after the 2009-10 reconstruction Highway 409 serves as a direct link between Highway 401, Highway 427, and Pearson International Airport. While it is not intended as a commuter route, there are three exits serving industrial areas in Etobicoke centred on the highway. Highway 409 also serves as the only connections between westbound Highway 401 and northbound Highway 427 and between southbound Highway 427 and eastbound Highway 401, as no access to either is provided at the 401-427 interchange. Highway 409 begins at Airport Road as the knotted flyovers from Toronto Pearson Airport converge into the freeway from the various terminals. Through this section to Highway 427, the highway is maintained by the Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA) and has a posted speed limit of . The flyover from Highway 427 to Highway 409 was constructed in 1992, replacing an at-grade signalized intersection. As the highway passes under Highway 427, it turns southeasterly southward and takes on an east‚Äìwest orientation. It passes over Carlingview Drive, and begins to descend into a trench. It passes beneath Highway 27, two CN railway spurs, and Iron Street before returning to level grade. Around the interchange with Martin Grove Road, the freeway twists slightly to the north and south between factories and warehouses. At its eastern terminus, the eastbound Highway 409 crosses Kipling Avenue and two lanes of it merges onto each of the Highway 401 express and collector lanes, while the between Weston Road to the east and Kipling Avenue the two westbound collector lanes diverge and become the westbound lanes of Highway 409 and three westbound collector lanes join up with the westbound Highway 401 express lanes to form the six-lanes of the Highway west of there.  History  Plans for Highway 409, originally known as the Belfield Expressway, were first presented in 1965 to the Peel County (now Peel Region) council. In September 1968, three possible routes were submitted to the council. At the time, the town of Malton, within Peel County, occupied the area of the planned expressway, having not yet been amalgamated with municipalities within Peel County to the south to create the City of Mississauga. The strip of land would require the expropriation and demolition of 50 houses, as well as several businesses, a school, and two community parks. Citizens of the village formed a group to protest the freeway and to demand another route be taken. An above- grade alternative, similar to the Gardiner Expressway was proposed, as well as a tunnel under the airport. However, at the same time, Toronto was embroiled in heated debate over the fate of its planned urban expressway system. When the Spadina Expressway was cancelled in 1971, the planned Belfield Expressway was completely revised. Instead of continuing northwest from Highway 427 and through Malton's four-corners at Derry Road and Airport Road towards Brampton, it would curve southwest and provide access to the developing Toronto International Airport. Southbound traffic from Highway 427 waited at a traffic light to cross the northbound lanes and enter Highway 409 eastbound until the modern flyover ramp was built in the early 1990s. Before plans for the new route were finalized, a flyover was built to provide access from Belfield Road to eastbound Highway 401, opening on October 7, 1968. Because the lands on which the freeway was to be built were occupied, the province elected to apply to expropriate the right-of-way in April 1972. Construction was underway by the end of the year, with the first contracts constructing the trench section near Highway 27\\\\. Structures, drainage and grading were completed west of Iron Street to Carlingview Avenue in 1974. In June of that year, contracts were awarded for the same work east of Iron Street to Highway 401\\\\. When this was completed in 1975, a paving contract was awarded from Carlingview Avenue to Highway 401. Highway 409 first opened to traffic by 1976, with temporary ramps at Carlingview Avenue acting as the western terminus. That year the final contracts were awarded to construct portions of the Highway 427 interchange and connect Highway 409 with the airport road system. The entire freeway opened on August 25, 1978. The flyover ramp, which connects southbound Highway 427 with eastbound Highway 409 was constructed in the early 1990s. Prior to that, an at-grade intersection crossed the northbound lanes of Highway 427, controlled by a traffic signal. This signal had the longest cycle of any traffic light in Toronto during its years of operation. The portion of Highway 409 west of Highway 427 is owned and operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA). Despite its private ownership, the section east of Airport Road is still considered a part of Highway 409. The GTAA purchased this section of the highway in 2000 in order to rebuild the approaches to Toronto Pearson Airport. Until 2008, Highway 409 remained almost unchanged from its original construction. However, beginning on July 10, 2008, traffic access was restricted to the outermost lanes. The steel \\"W\\" guardrail and truss light posts in the median were replaced by an Ontario Tall Wall barrier with a high- mast lighting system. Construction was carried out over several years and was scheduled for completion on September 1, 2011. The interchange between Highway 427 and Highway 409 was built to its current configuration by 1992.

He later defended himself saying he felt the business owners were right that the inspectors were too severe, or that the inspectors could have made a mistake.

Located at the intersection of Highway 401 and Allen Road, it opened in 1964 as the largest enclosed shopping mall in the world.https://nyhs.ca/history/yorkdale-shopping-centre-opened-as- worlds-largest-enclosed-shopping-mall/ Yorkdale is currently the third largest shopping mall in Canada by floor space and has the highest sales per unit area of any mall in Canada, with current merchandise sales levels at roughly /square foot. At 18 million annual visitors, it is one of the country's busiest malls. Many international retailers have opened their first Canadian locations at Yorkdale. Yorkdale is currently owned by a joint venture between the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System through its subsidiary Oxford Properties Group and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. History =Construction and design= In the 1950s, the department store chain T. Eaton & Co. bought a site at Dufferin Street and Highway 401 for a new massive, suburban location. In 1958, rival department store chain Simpson's purchased a site to the east and the plan to build the complex was announced that year. Design of the mall was given to the Seattle firm of John Graham Consultants, except for the Simpson's store, designed by John Andrews of John B. Parkin Associates. Howard Lesser was the planning and development consultant. Using Lesser's market research, the developers determined how much floor space to give up to each category of retailer, and chose retailers who would appeal to a broad range of shoppers. The mall opened on February 26, 1964, under the ownership of the Trizec Corporation.\\"Many happy returns\\", The Globe and Mail, Taylor Woodrow was the main contractor with Charles Waggett VP as the head construction manager. The project was finished on time and under budget. Plan Electric Company did the major electrical work for the Centre including the Eaton's Store and numerous others under the direction of its president, Sid Cohen. February 21, 2004 Its gross leasable area (GLA) was over , by far the biggest in Canada at the time. It was also one of the largest shopping centres in the world. When it opened, Yorkdale was the first Canadian mall to include two major department stores: Simpson's and Eaton's, under the same roof. Built at a cost of million, Yorkdale was the first major suburban mall constructed in Toronto. Located at the edge of the urbanized city, the new shopping centre was dependent on the construction of the Spadina Expressway, later renamed Allen Road, as the developers would not proceed until the freeway was approved for construction. The mall was constructed with a novel system for its retailers to receive merchandise. While other Canadian shopping centres had their receiving doors located at the back side, Yorkdale was constructed with a one-way, two-laned road for trucks running beneath the centre that leads directly to retailers' basement storages. The design of the mall included a tall atrium, wide halls and tall ceilings. The corridors still retain this look and feel although renovations in 2006 replaced the ceilings, windows, floors and skylights. =Expansions and renovations= The Universal Man statue was relocated from the base of the CN Tower to the west parking lot of Yorkdale in 1994. The Universal Man statue in the west parking lot was relocated from the base of the CN Tower to accommodate the construction of the Rogers Centre (then known as SkyDome) in 1987 and relocated to Yorkdale in 1994. In 1999, Yorkdale completed a major overhaul, adding a Rainforest Caf√© restaurant, a Famous Players SilverCity movie theatre (which has since been taken over by Cineplex Entertainment), and an Indigo Books and Music store on the north side of the mall, facing Highway 401. In 2005, a $60 million expansion on the former site of its Eaton's department store increased the size of Yorkdale to , and increased the number of stores from about 210 to 260. A highlight of this expansion was the construction of a high glass atrium running in length, which hangs from an exterior support structure. The expansion added Old Navy, Zara, H&M;, and Home Outfitters as sub-anchors. This gave Yorkdale the title of the third largest mall in Ontario after Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga and Toronto Eaton Centre, ahead of Scarborough Town Centre in terms of retail floor space. The renovation project continued into 2006 and 2007. This renovation matched the earlier sections of the mall to the style of the 2005 expansion. Key elements of this project included new public washrooms, the opening of a Moxie's Grill & Bar restaurant, and new sliding automatic doors at all entrances. An advertising campaign, branded as \\"Change It Up!\\" was launched in conjunction with the renovation and redevelopment, winning a MAXI Award from the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) in 2007. Expansion continued in the second half of the decade. In April 2008, Yorkdale opened a Michael Kors store. Later additions included Armani Exchange, Crate & Barrel, BOSS, and a Tiffany & Co. Renovations completed in 2012 saw the mall's former food court redeveloped into a new wing, housing new stores including a Microsoft Store. In January 2011, Yorkdale announced another expansion, adding another , sufficient for 40 store fronts, and 800 underground parking spaces. This new wing took the space of the southwest parking lot. The expansion also relocated and doubled the number of seats at the food court, improved public access, and landscaped portions of the property. The expansion, costing $35 million, was opened in the summer of 2012, and completed in November 2012. The existing food court was relocated to a new location on the third level of the former Eaton's department store. The new food court, named \\"Dine on 3\\", covers over two floors and features 18 different eateries, including A&W;, KFC, New York Fries, Subway, and the second Ontario location of Chick-fil- Ahttps://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2020/01/chick-fil-toronto-yorkdale-spans- two-floors/ (after the first at One Bloor in downtown Toronto). The area of the former food court was redeveloped into a new wing, which housed new stores including a Microsoft Store, DavidsTea, and a Tesla showroom, as well as a larger Apple Store. The new parking garage was built below the wing. In June 2013, Sears Canada announced the closing of their store at Yorkdale.Sears Canada to close two, possibly three, Toronto area stores  Toronto Star. Toronto Star (June 14, 2013). Retrieved on July 26, 2013. The former Sears space is now used for Sporting Life and RH, both opened on October 19, 2017. In April 2013, Yorkdale announced a $330 million expansion, which would add an additional of retail, featuring a three-level Nordstrom store and a Uniqlo store. This project involved the closure of the Rainforest Caf√© (at Yorkdale since 1999), as well as the demolition of the multi-level parking garage at the southeast of the complex bordering Yorkdale Road. The project began in January 2014 and the new wing opened for business in late 2016. Rainforest Caf√© has since been replaced with an expansion of Sport Chek. Milestones Grill and Bar, located near Hudson's Bay was closed in 2016. It was then announced that American restaurant chain The Cheesecake Factory would open its first Canadian location in the mall. The location was renovated and expanded to accommodate the new restaurant and it opened to the public in November 2017. As of 2019, the restaurant still experiences wait times up to three hours. In 2017, Oxford Properties submitted an application to the City of Toronto for a block zoning plan to guide future development of the site. In the first phase, new buildings would be constructed along the Dufferin Avenue frontage, incorporating a boutique hotel, a cinema and new retail, with future phases being built on the north parking lot, to incorporate residential and office uses. In March 2019, the City launched a study on the re-development of the parking lots and other areas of the mall property to improve traffic as well as mixed-use for the site to include residential and retail use. If approved, the re-development would result in parking being moved underground. However, some residents in the neighbourhood are opposed to the development. =Incidents= Two stabbings occurred at the mall in 2008. In the first half of 2013, two shootings occurred at the mall. The first one took place in the external surface lot late on a Saturday night in March 2013, leaving one man dead and one man injured. In May 2013, a man was injured by shots fired into the Joey restaurant at midnight on a Friday night. Yorkdale upgraded its security with a new $3.4 million video surveillance system that went into service in March 2014. The new system provides full 360-degree surveillance of the mall and the parking lots. It also includes licence plate recognition technology at parking entrances. In August 2018, Yorkdale Mall was shut down after a spate of gun violence erupted at its Starbucks location. Though nobody was seriously injured, it caused major delays on major TTC routes. Retailers =Department stores and restaurants= The department stores at the mall are RH, Hudson's Bay, Nordstrom and Holt Renfrew. Junior anchors include Uniqlo, Muji, Sporting Life, and Indigo Books and Music. Restaurants in Yorkdale outside the food court include The Cheesecake Factory, Michel's Bakery Cafe and Michel's Baguette, Moxie's Grill & Bar, Joey, Jamie's Italian and Pickle Barrel. =Retail mix= A Gucci store in Yorkdale. Since the late 1990s, Yorkdale's management has focused on attracting luxury brand retailers. When first opened, Yorkdale had a large number of clothing retailers along with large department stores in the mix of stores. Yorkdale was the first Canadian mall to include two major department stores: Simpson's and Eaton's, under the same roof. Eaton's went bankrupt in 1999 and its space was redeveloped into a new wing that opened in 2005. Since the late 1990s onward, Yorkdale's management has focused on attracting luxury brand retailers, especially those selling clothing and accessories, as well as high-end electronics, a strategy also adopted by Sherway Gardens. These include Versace, Bulgari, Burberry, Cartier, Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Kate Spade, Tory Burch, Moncler, Jimmy Choo, Apple, and Bose. Yorkdale has also attracted American and international retailers seeking to expand to Canada. Yorkdale bought out the lease of Sears in 2014 to reallocate that space for higher- priced department stores. Unlike other major malls in Toronto, such as Toronto Eaton Centre, Scarborough Town Centre, Sherway Gardens, and Fairview Mall, Yorkdale does not have grocery stores or discount store tenants. However, Yorkdale has a Shoppers Drug Mart. In the vicinity of Yorkdale, there are factory outlets and discount stores nearby on Orfus Road, while big box stores are located on Dufferin Street just north of Highway 401. Lawrence Allen Centre, formerly Lawrence Square Shopping Centre, to the south on Lawrence Avenue at Allen Road, serves the local community. Yorkdale places a requirement on each tenant to renovate regularly. When each tenant renews its lease with the mall, they are required to renovate their store. =Canadian firsts= Yorkdale has been the point of entry into the Canadian market for many widely known international commercial enterprises. Companies that have opened or plan on opening their first Canadian store at Yorkdale include: Tesla Motors opened their first store in Canada at Yorkdale. The mall has been a point of entry into the Canadian market for several international enterprises. * Apple Store ‚Äî May 2005, relocated to new wing in December 2012. * Bath & Body Works ‚Äî September 2008 * Crate & Barrel ‚Äî Late 2008 * Furla ‚Äî October 2019 * GEOX ‚Äî May 2005 * J.Crew ‚Äî August 2011 * Kate Spade New York ‚Äî November 2012 * LOFT ‚Äî November 2012 * Microsoft Store ‚Äî November 2012 * Ted Baker ‚Äî November 2012 * Tesla Motors ‚Äî November 2012 * True Religion ‚Äî October 2010 * Zara Home ‚Äî August 2013 * John Varvatos ‚Äî November 2013 * Christian Louboutin ‚Äî November 2013 * David Yurman ‚Äî Winter 2013 * AllSaints ‚Äî April 2013 * Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A. ‚Äî July 2013 * White House Black Market ‚Äî October 2013 * Tumi ‚Äî November 2013 * The Cheesecake Factory ‚Äî November 2017 According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, more than 30 American retailers contacted mall management, wanting to open their first Canadian stores in Yorkdale after Crate & Barrel revealed that their first store outside the United States would open in Yorkdale in 2008.

The Amish, a subsect of the Anabaptist Christian movement, intentionally segregate themselves from other communities as a part of their faith. For Amish youth, the Rumspringa normally begins around the ages of 14‚Äì16 and ends when a youth chooses either to be baptized in the Amish church or to leave the community. For Wenger Mennonites, Rumspringa occurs between ages of 17 and 21. Not all Amish use this term (it does not occur in John A. Hostetler's extended discussion of adolescence among the Amish), but in sects that do, Amish elders generally view it as a time for courtship and finding a spouse. A popular view exists by which the period is institutionalized as a rite of passage, and the usual behavioral restrictions are relaxed, so that Amish youth can acquire some experience and knowledge of the non-Amish world. Rumspringa is also the subject of the film documentary Devil's Playground (2002), which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary and for three documentary Emmy Awards‚ÄîBest Documentary, Editing, and Direction. Spin-offs of the film include a book of transcribed interviews, titled Rumspringa: To Be Or Not To Be Amish, and a UPN reality television series, Amish in the City.  Etymology  Rumspringa is a Pennsylvania German noun meaning \\"running around\\". It is a cognate of the Standard German verb rumspringen.The word is also translated thus in Dialects do not derive from standard languages, but as a cognate, this expression is closely related to the Standard German verb (he)rumspringen meaning \\"to jump around or about\\". The Standard German term is a compound word of the adverb herum (around, about) and the verb springen (\\"to jump\\"). However, in Swiss German as in some other southern German dialects, springen ‚Äì besides meaning \\"to jump\\" ‚Äì also means \\"to run\\". This term/concept also is used as a separable verb, i.e., rumspringen (to jump around) / er springt rum (he jumps around). In Pennsylvania German, the prefix rum is a contraction of herum ‚Äì a development which is also all but general to spoken standard German. The infinitive (and gerund) form \\"-a\\" is standard in Pennsylvania German and other forms of general Upper German.  Popularized view  Amish adolescents may engage in rebellious behavior, resisting or defying parental norms. In many cultures, enforcement may be relaxed, and misbehavior tolerated or overlooked to a degree. A view of rumspringa has emerged in popular culture that this divergence from custom is an accepted part of adolescence or a rite of passage for Amish youth. Among the Amish, however, rumspringa simply refers to adolescence. During that time a certain amount of misbehavior is unsurprising and is not severely condemned (for instance, by Meidung or shunning). Adults who have made a permanent and public commitment to the faith would be held to the higher standards of behavior defined in part by the Schleitheim and Dordrecht confessions. In a narrow sense the young are not bound by the Ordnung because they have not taken adult membership in the church. Amish adolescents do remain, however, under the strict authority of parents who are bound to Ordnung, and there is no period when adolescents are formally released from these rules. It is the period when the young person is regarded as having reached maturity, and is permitted to attend the Sunday night \\"singings\\" that are the focus of courtship among the Amish; according to Amish sources, a youth who dares to attend one of these events before the age of 16 might be force-fed warm milk from a spoon, as a good-natured reminder to observe the lines of status. Members of the local church district often attend the singings and usually bring younger children along. A minority of Amish youth do diverge from established customs. Some may be found: * Wearing non- traditional clothing and hair styles (referred to as \\"dressing English\\") * Driving vehicles other than horse-drawn vehicles (for communities that eschew motor vehicles) * Not attending home prayer * Drinking and using other recreational drugs Not all youth diverge from custom during this period; approximately half in the larger communities and the majority in smaller Amish communities remain within the norms of Amish dress or behavior during adolescence. Almost 90 percent of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the Amish church.  Leaving the community  Some Amish youth do indeed separate themselves from the community, even going to live among the \\"English\\", or non-Amish Americans, experiencing modern technology. Their behavior during this time does not necessarily prevent them from returning for adult baptism into the Amish church. Most of them do not wander far from their family's homes during this time, and large numbers (85%‚Äì90%) ultimately choose to join the church. However this proportion varies from community to community, and within a community between more and less acculturated Amish. For example, Swartzentruber Amish have a lower retention rate than Andy Weaver Amish (90% vs 97%; although most of Swartzentruber Amish do not allow teenagers to leave the community during rumspringa at will). This figure was significantly lower as recently as the 1950s. Desertion from the Amish community is not a long-term trend, and was more of a problem during the early colonial years.  Variations  As among the non-Amish, there is variation among communities and individual families as to the best response to adolescent misbehavior. Some Amish communities hold views similar to Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites in seeking more productive, spiritual activities for their youth. Some even take up meditation. In some cases, patience and forbearance prevail, and in others, vigorous discipline. Far from an open separation from parental ways, the misbehavior of young people during the rumspringa is usually furtive, though often collective (this is especially true in smaller and more isolated populations; the larger communities are discussed below). They may or may not mingle with non-Amish in these excursions. The age is marked normatively in some Amish communities by allowing the young man to purchase a small \\"courting buggy\\", or ‚Äì in some communities ‚Äì by painting the yard-gate blue (traditionally meaning \\"daughter of marriageable age living here\\"; the custom is noted by A. M. Aurand in The Amish (1938), along with the reasonable caution that sometimes a blue gate is just a blue gate). There is some opinion that adolescent rebellion tends to be more radical, more institutionalized (and therefore in a sense more accepted) in the more restrictive communities. The nature of the rumspringa period differs from individual to individual and from community to community. In large Amish communities like those of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Holmes and Wayne Counties, Ohio, and Elkhart and LaGrange Counties, Indiana, the Amish are numerous enough that an Amish youth subculture exists. During rumspringa, the Amish youth in these large communities will join one of various groups ranging from the most rebellious to the least. These groups are not necessarily divided across traditional Amish church district boundaries, although they often are. In many smaller communities, Amish youth may have a much more restricted rumspringa, and likewise may be less likely to partake in strong rebellious behavior, as they lack the anonymity of larger communities. Wenger Mennonites youth go through a period of rumspringa starting at age 17 and typically ending at marriage, a few years older than the Amish do. Since most of the youth get baptized when they are ages 16 to 19, they typically do not get into the type of serious offenses of the most \\"disorderly\\" of the Amish youth.  Literature  = Scholarly and documentary works = Rumspringa is mentioned in the standard works about the Amish, like Hostettler‚Äôs Amish Society, the works of Donald Kraybill, An Amish Paradox by Hurst and McConell and others, but there is only one scholarly book about it: * Richard A. Stevick: Growing up Amish: The Teenage Years, Baltimore, 2007.

Etymology The word ' is derived (via Yiddish) from the East Slavic word ', a diminutive from ', \\"small pancake\\". The Slavic word derives from Ancient Greek ·ºêŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ, diminutive of ·ºîŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"olive oil\\", \\"oily substance\\". The word ' (), the Hebrew name for latke, refers in the Book of Samuel to a dumpling made from kneaded dough, as part of the story of Amnon and Tamar. Some interpreters have noted that the homonym ' () means \\"heart,\\" and the verbal form of l-v-v occurs in the Song of Songs as well. In the lexicon of Ashkenazi Jews from Udmurtia and Tatarstan there are recorded versions of the kosher-style appellation of latkes during the eight-day Hanukkah holiday.Altyntsev A.V., \\"The Concept of Love in Ashkenazim of Udmurtia and Tatarstan\\", Nauka Udmurtii. 2013. ‚Ññ 4 (66), p. 131.

History First variants of latkes go back to at least the Middle Ages. They were probably made of cheese (probably either ricotta or curd cheese), fried in poppyseed oil or butter, served with fruit preserves, and these cheese latkes were the most common kind of latke in Ashkenazi communities until the 19th century (when the potato arrived in eastern Europe). However, at the time, the cheapest and most readily available cooking fat was schmaltz, rendered poultry fat (usually from a goose or chicken), and due to Jewish dietary laws, which prohibit the mixing of meat and dairy products, alternatives to the cheese latke arrived. These included buckwheat or rye flour, or other tubers endemic to the region, such as turnips. However, once the potato became popularized in eastern Europe, it was quickly included as a latke ingredient and became so popular that today, the word latke is almost synonymous with potatoes. Variations Latkes today are traditionally made with potatoes, although other vegetables are also sometimes used, albeit less frequently. Potato remains the most popular variety of latke. There are two main varieties of potato latkes, those made with grated potato and those made with pur√©ed or mashed potato. The textures of these two varieties are very different. =Grated potato version= Latkes made of grated potatoes with onions Latkes made of grated potatoes are the most traditional version and are still very popular. They are prepared by grating potatoes and onions with a box grater or food processor, and excess moisture is squeezed out. Eggs and flour or matzo meal are then mixed with the potatoes, and the latkes are fried in batches in an oiled pan. The thickness depends on personal preference. =Pur√©ed potato version= This version of latke is made with pureed potatoes. As with the aforementioned grated potato version, potatoes and onions are grated, and are added to egg and matzo meal. But in this version the ingredients are then processed in a food processor until a pureed consistency is attained. This form of latke is easier to shape, and according to Jewish chef Jamie Geller, they have a ‚Äúpudding-like consistency.‚Äù =Other variations= Latkes need not necessarily be made from potatoes. Prior to the introduction of the potato to the Old World, latkes were and in some places still are, made from a variety of other vegetables, cheeses, legumes, or starches, depending on the available local ingredients and foods of the various places where Jews lived. Numerous modern recipes call for the addition of ingredients such as onions and carrots.Rachel Ray, Quick Potato and Carrot Latkes, The Food Network, December 20, 2008.Philip and Karen Selwyn, Potato- carrot-onion Latkes, rec.food.cuisine.jewish archives, Oct. 11, 1998, 1:00 AM. Daily variations on a simple potato latka might include zucchini, sweet onion and gruyere (for french onion flavor) and some variations made with sweet potatoes. In popular culture Latkes are a traditional food consumed by Ashkenazi Jews during Hanukkah, and have featured prominently in Jewish, Israeli and general American culture. *Latke, the Lucky Dog is a 2012 children‚Äôs book about Hanukkah that features latkes and a dog named after the iconic Jewish food. *In the film Eight Crazy Nights (an American Hannukah film by Adam Sandler), latkes are featured prominently and can be seen in various scenes; they are eaten by several characters in the film. *The novel American Psycho mentions latkes briefly in a scene where protagonist Patrick Bateman is mockingly offered some by his colleague Preston. *In the film The Hebrew Hammer, the title character is seen eating latkes and makes a number of latke- related puns.

Gameplay is essentially the same as in the beatmania series, with a few enhancements to the hardware. The beatmania III series was relatively short-lived, spanning only 2 years. It had five releases, the last one being Beatmania III The Final in 2002. Hardware Beatmania III the Final =Audio system= beatmania III cabinets feature a total of 10 speakers. There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen, and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine. The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks, so that both players may use their own headphones to enjoy the game's audio. Using headphones does not disable the external speakers. =Effector system= Whereas the original Beatmania features simply an \\"Effector\\" button, beatmania III has an extensive panel for using a number of different effectors. Available effectors vary widely, including Echo, Low Pass, High Pass, Flanger, Phaser, Volume Bass, Lo-Fi, and several others. The chosen effector can be applied to just the background track, just the sounds created by the player, or both, and the intensity of the effect can be adjusted with two parameter knobs. Enabling the effector is achieved by simply pressing the foot pedal. =Foot pedal= While the original 5-keys-and-turntable layout remains unchanged, beatmania III adds a foot pedal for each player. In normal play, this enables or disables different sound-altering effectors. Some songs have a \\"foot\\" version that adds a seventh column with green note bars that is played by using the foot pedal. The game also allows players to set the foot pedal so that it functions as any one of the game's 5 keys. =Floppy drive= beatmania III has a feature unique to the Bemani series: a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. By inserting any blank Windows-formatted disk before starting, the player can have the game create files on the disk used to record personal best scores. After playing, the disk is then removed from the drive for later repeated use in beatmania III, or for looking at scores using one's personal computer. The floppy disk was also required to unlock secret songs or game modes on some versions of the game. Releases The beatmania III series was only released as an arcade game. No console releases were ever produced even though both Japanese and North American IIDX controllers have input ports for a bass pedal. Each release added songs from the Beatmania games their titles refer to, including most previous arcade releases.

Locally, it is known as Radio X (a reference to \\"Generation X\\", as most of CHOI's listeners consider themselves). It has been owned by Genex Communications since July 1996. The Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings released in December 2004 revealed that CHOI was the most popular radio station in the city with 443,100 listeners, up from 380,500 earlier in the year. The station is well known for airing controversial ideas and populist opinions. The station has become a target of various groups, notably feminists and gay activists, as well as prominent politicians, for some controversial political statements. Following a ruling by the CRTC, the station's licence lapsed, with its renewal application denied, in 2004 for failing \\"to comply with the Radio Regulations 1986 (the Regulations) as well as CHOI's Code of Ethics, adherence to which is required by one of its conditions of licence\\". Pending a court challenge, the station was permitted to stay on-air without a licence. On May 8, 2006, Genex announced it would sell the station to RNC Media. The transaction ‚Äì strictly speaking, the issuing of a new licence to RNC Media on the same frequency rather than a simple transfer of ownership ‚Äì was approved by the CRTC on October 20, 2006. Main hosts of the station Jeff Fillion was the most popular host at the station. He was the morning man, hosting with his staff Le monde parall√®le de Jeff (Fillion's Parallel World) every weekday morning. Over the years, his ideas and opinions made him the city's most controversial radio host. He teamed up for a time with longtime morning man Andr√© Arthur. Fillion was sued numerous times by many well-known people around the province because of his controversial comments. The station's problems with the CRTC are mostly attributed to him and his comments. In the past, he was well known for his show's contests. For example, he created a contest in the late 1990s where a woman would win a breast implants surgery on Good Friday - \\"Good Friday\\" being \\"Vendredi saint\\" in French, and the words \\"saint\\" and \\"sein\\" (breast) have the same pronunciation. On the air, on the morning of March 17, 2005, Fillion announced that he was immediately resigning as host of the morning show. In May 2005, the former host started giving interviews to various Quebec media where he complained about what he says is a lack of respect towards him by the station's owners. He says that they have not offered him any severance pay since he left the air. The owners replied that they have offered him various jobs inside their company but he has refused all of them. The station also claimed that Fillion's demands for almost $2 million in severance pay were unreasonable. He is apparently also asking to be cleared of all responsibility in current or future lawsuits against him or the station. This would bring the total to $5 million. Gilles Parent was hired by the station in 2001. He came from CHIK-FM, CHOI's rival station, to host the Le retour de Gilles Parent every weekday afternoon. His thoughts and opinions are less controversial and are expressed in a much more respectful manner than Fillion's. Denis Gravel (known as \\"The fucking news guy\\", name given by Korn's former guitar player) hosted Le Char de hits until 2004, when it became the most popular radio program of the area at lunch time. He also did the news segments during Fillion's morning show. When Fillion resigned, Gravel replaced him as the host of the morning show. On March 16, 2004, he became well known in the province for inadvertently revealing the name of one of the victims of a highly publicized child prostitution case during Parent's afternoon show, while performing a live commentary after a day in court, where popular radioman Robert Gillet of competitor station CJMF-FM had stood in the accused box. Dispute with the CRTC Quebec Parliament Building on July 22, 2004 On July 13, 2004, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled that the radio station would be shut down because it kept airing offensive and insulting remarks even after being put on probation in 2002. This meant that the station would be forced to stop transmitting on the night of August 31, 2004, when its licence expired. This prompted a huge march in the streets of Quebec City on July 22 when 50,000 people walked through the streets of the city to support the station, claiming the right of freedom of speech and opinion. It was the largest march in the capital city of Quebec since the 1960s. On August 10, 2004, the station staged a protest against the CRTC's decision on Parliament Hill in Ottawa where 5,000 Quebec fans of the station went to the country's capital to demonstrate their support for the station. CHOI aired their regular afternoon show live from Ottawa. On August 11, 2004, the station filed an appeal in federal court to extend its licence and to reverse the CRTC's decision. On August 25, 2004, the CRTC and the federal government did not object to the station's request to continue its normal operations during the court proceedings. This meant that even though the station's licence expired on August 31, 2004, it was permitted to continue transmitting after that date and as long as the court procedures are in progress. On May 24, 2005, the court started to hear the case. For four days, the station's lawyers pleaded to the three judges of the court that the CRTC overstepped its authority in ordering the shutdown of the station. They claimed that it should not be possible for the CRTC to shut down a station based only on the contents of the station's shows. The lawyers also pleaded that the CRTC could have used more moderate methods to punish the station, such as imposing a fine. Both the station and the CRTC have said that should they lose, they will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On September 1, 2005, the court ruled against the station, stating in its decision that \\"freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech do not mean freedom of defamation, freedom of oppression and freedom of opprobrium.\\" This meant that the station would be required shut down within 20 days unless it tried to contest the decision in the Supreme Court. On June 14, 2007, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Had the sale to RNC Media not gone through, the decision would have effectively forced CHOI-FM to stop broadcasting at 23:59 the same day. However, RNC Media had already received CRTC approval for its \\"new\\" licence for 98.1, making the court decision moot. The dispute has also had major political implications, as it was the primary reason that Sylvain L√©gar√© was elected in Vanier in a by-election in 2004 for the ADQ. In addition, radio personality Andr√© Arthur was elected as an independent in the 2006 federal election in Portneuf‚ÄîJacques-Cartier, and most of the other seats in the area went to the Conservative Party of Canada, which had previously been extremely weak in Quebec.  Later history  After RNC Media acquired the station, CHOI shifted to alternative rock, becoming the first French-language alternative rock station in Canada, but continued to report as an active rock station on Mediabase. As of 2010, the station was delisted from Mediabase, and moved to its current talk radio format. On August 28, 2018, RNC Media announced the sale of CHOI to Leclerc Communication (owner of CJEC-FM and CFEL-FM) for an undisclosed sum, later revealed to be $19 million. As it owns the maximum number of French-language stations it can own on the FM band in Quebec City, the company would have had to divest a station or seek an exemption. The CRTC approved the deal, under the condition that Leclerc divest one of its stations in Quebec City. However, as Leclerc refused to agree to this condition, the company called off the purchase.

Life He was born at Goudhurst in Kent on 7 January 1755. He succeeded when about 21 to the business in West Smithfield of a linendraper named Greenland, to whom he had been apprenticed. Later, and until 1816, he was a successful West India merchant. He lived mainly at Goudhurst, where he built a small observatory; but moved to Blackheath in 1802. In 1806, using a then new transit circle built by Edward Troughton, he began compiling a star catalogue of stars down to about eighth or ninth magnitude. He spent ten years making observations on the Groombridge Transit Circle and another ten years doing reductions of the data (correcting for refraction, instrument error and clock error). In 1827 he suffered a \\"severe attack of paralysis\\" from which he never fully recovered. Others continued the work, continuing with corrections for aberration and nutation among others. Groombridge died in Blackheath. His Catalogue of Circumpolar Stars was published posthumously in 1838 with the help of fellow astronomer George Biddell Airy and others. An earlier edition had been published in 1833 but was found to contain errors and was withdrawn. In 1842, one of the stars in his catalogue, Groombridge 1830, was discovered by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander to have a very high proper motion. For many decades its proper motion was the highest known; today it still occupies third place.

It is served by the Central line and lies between Buckhurst Hill and Debden. It is the larger of the two Underground stations in the town of Loughton, with Debden station being the smaller. For the purposes of fare charging it is in Zone 6. History View NE, towards Epping and Ongar in 1957 The original station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway on 22 August 1856 and formed the terminus of the branch from London. The actual location of the station building was on the site of what is now the garden and emergency exit of Cafe Rouge, near the Lopping Hall in Loughton High Road, and of no9 Station Road, on a continuation of what eventually became the goods sidings, the line running across what are now the house sites and gardens on the west side of Station Road. The post 1865 goods and carriage sidings no longer exist and were located where the present car parks are. The pre-1865 station also had sidings and a coal wharf, extending almost to what is now St Mary's Church. This station is extensively documented in H W Paar and others, Loughton's First Station 2002 and in Pond, Strugnell and Martin The Loughton Railway 150 years on, 2006. There was also an excursion station or platform constructed along the westernmost edge of the goods yard site: this was used for the many thousands of excursionists who used Loughton as a base to visit nearby Epping Forest. The excursion station building, single-storey and brick built, was extant in 1935, but was demolished in the ensuing decade; it was replaced by a parcels and goods station, itself removed in the 1990s. It was re-sited some 500 yards to the south on 24 April 1865 as part of the extension of the line to Epping and Ongar. A new station was opened on 28 April 1940 in readiness for London Underground trains, which took over the service from British Railways (Eastern Region) on 21 November 1948. The station today The current station is of notable architectural importance and is a Grade II listed building. Designed by John Murray Easton for the London and North Eastern Railway, on behalf of London Transport, the main structure consists of a high, square block dominated by large arched windows at high level. The main elevation is flanked by symmetrical wings and, to the south, a single storey extension. The whole building, as well as the associated disused signal cabin and sub-station, is finished in carefully bonded, incised, gault bricks. The ticket hall takes the form of a lofty arched hall, from which leads a subway that gives access to the two island platforms. The platforms are dominated by graceful, gull-winged shaped reinforced canopies that were altered during 1980s renovations. Although some original platform furniture has been lost the timber platform benches, with the London Underground roundel forming the seat backs, survive.Underground Architecture; David Lawrence; Capital Transport; London; 1994 View of platforms The station has four platform faces and three tracks, with the middle bi-directional track usually used for services that terminate at the station. Those eastbound services that terminate at Loughton mostly return to central London, although some go into Loughton sidings (usually after the evening peak and late at night) which can accommodate 10 trains. A traincrew depot (\\"the Powerhouse\\") was converted from the matching electrical substation to the north-east of the station in 2006.

History The station in 1961 The station opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch from London to Loughton. It originally had staggered platforms, with the main buildings on the down side (tracks heading away from London). The 1856 station house survives to the south of the present platforms, but most of the present station dates from 1892, when the entrance was moved to Victoria Road. The building is similar to that at Billericay. Both were designed by W. N. Ashbee, the chief architect of the Great Eastern Railway, of which the station was a part, which was, from 1923, to become part of the London and North Eastern Railway. The station was transferred to London Underground ownership as part of the New Works Programme, 1935-1940 scheme that saw the electrification of the branch to form part of the Central line. This occurred on 21 November 1948. The station maintains its late Victorian ambiance to a surprising extent. When the line was electrified a pedestrian underpass was built in order to connect the two parts of Queens Road previously joined by a level crossing. At the same time a pair of exit/entrances to the south of the station were built giving direct access to Lower Queens Road and Queens Road via the new underpass. These exits were closed in 1982, but reopened in May 2018 in order to provide access to the station for mobility impaired passengers. For the purposes of fare charging it is in Zone 5. As of 2007 it is the only station on the eastern portion of the Central line in that zone. Passengers travelling from the station leaving in either direction must cross a zone boundary.

The story is a fictionalized account for the lives of the Mirabal sisters, Dominican revolutionary activists, who opposed the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo and were assassinated on November 25, 1960. In the film, Salma Hayek played one of the sisters, Minerva, and Edward James Olmos plays Trujillo. Marc Anthony has a minor role as Minerva's first love, and the impetus for her later revolutionary activities. Plot The film begins with pictures and video of the actual victims of Trujillo. During the montage, a title card appears that says: :From 1930 to 1961, General Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo held absolute control of the Dominican Republic. :His secret alliance with the church, aristocrats, intellectuals and the press were the foundation of his dictatorship. :His formula to remain in power was simple: murder anyone who opposed him. :More than 30,000 people were executed during his regime of terror... The scene shifts to a prison cell, where one of his victims, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), recounts the events of the story. Minerva and her three sisters, Patria (Lumi Cavazos), Ded√© (Pilar Padilla), and Mar√≠a Teresa \\"Mat√©\\" (M√≠a Maestro), live on a farm in rural Ojo De Agua. Minerva, the outspoken sister, convinces her father, Enrique Mirabal (Fernando Becerril), to send her, Patria, and Mat√© to a boarding school. The sisters spend five years away at school, during which time Minerva captures the attention of Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who notices her at a school play. When school is over, Minerva wishes to study to become a lawyer, but women are not allowed in law school. The sisters return to the farm, and Minerva soon meets and falls in love with Virgilio \\"Lio\\" (Marc Anthony), a member of the Dominican resistance, who gives her the nickname \\"Butterfly\\", or Mariposa in Spanish. Lio's activities during a college protest are noticed, and he is forced to leave the country out of fear for his life, though he continues to write to Minerva. Minerva, along with her family, is invited to a formal ball at Trujillo's palace, where she dances with him. During their dance, Minerva asks for permission to attend law school, but Trujillo declines. He grabs Minerva inappropriately, and she responds by recoiling and slapping him in the face. Her family quickly rushes to her side, and Trujillo allows them to leave. The next day, the chief of police, Captain Pe√±a (Pedro Armend√°riz, Jr.), arrives at the family farm and takes Minerva's father away. The sisters spend several weeks dealing with the police bureaucracy, trying to locate their father, before it's suggested that there is a way Minerva can get her father out of prison. Minerva goes to the palace, and Trujillo suggests that her father can leave if she stays. Minerva points out that her mother is waiting outside and would \\"appreciate his hospitality\\" too. Trujillo decides that they should leave it to chance (a dice roll) to determine if Minerva and her family go free, or if Minerva stays at the palace while her family is released. Minerva accepts, but asks to \\"up the stakes\\"‚Äîif she wins, she goes free and also gets to attend law school, and if she loses, Trujillo can \\"have his wish\\". She rolls the dice and wins, and Trujillo lets her leave. Minerva's victory is hollow. Her father is released from prison, but has been tortured and soon dies. While attending his funeral, the police chief delivers to Minerva a letter permitting her to attend law school. Minerva's hatred of Trujillo is intense, but she decides to accept his \\"gift\\" because she views it as her only way to effectively oppose him. While in law school, Minerva discovers that Lio has been killed by Trujillo supporters even though he was out of the country. She meets other members of the resistance, who, through Lio, know of her as \\"Butterfly\\". She becomes a member of the resistance, and over time Patria and Mat√© learn of her activities and become involved too. She falls in love with Manolo Tav√°rez (Demi√°n Bichir), a fellow law student and member of the resistance, and they are married. When Minerva graduates from law school, Trujillo is present to pass out the diplomas. All the other students receive diplomas, but he refuses to give Minerva hers, saying he agreed to allow her to attend law school, not to practice law. After law school, Minerva has children but continues her resistance activities. After a series of increasingly dangerous events, she, Mat√©, and many resistance members are arrested and sent to jail. Minerva becomes a symbol, and many prisoners, guards, and outsiders secretly voice their support for \\"the Butterflies\\". Eventually, Minerva and Mat√© are released from jail, but their husbands and Patria's are still held captive. The women continue their efforts to locate their husbands. Trujillo stops by to visit Minerva at her home, and she asks for his help to get their husbands released. Trujillo vows to help Minerva \\"end her troubles\\".

It is usually only undertaken by young males entering adulthood. Individual Indigenous cultures have their own names for their rites of passage. \\"Vision quest\\" is an English language umbrella term, and may not always be accurate or used by the cultures in question. Among Native American cultures who have this type of rite, it usually consists of a series of ceremonies led by Elders and supported by the young man's community. The process includes a complete fast for four days and nights, alone at a sacred site in nature which is chosen by the Elders for this purpose. Some communities have used the same sites for many generations. During this time, the young person prays and cries out to the spirits that they may have a vision, one that will help them find their purpose in life, their role in a community, and how they may best serve the People. Dreams or visions may involve natural symbolism ‚Äì such as animals or forces of nature ‚Äì that require interpretation by Elders. After their passage into adulthood, and guided by this experience, the young person may then become an apprentice or student of an adult who has mastered this role. When talking to Yellow Wolf, Lucullus Virgil McWhorter came to believe that the person fasts, and stays awake and concentrates on their quest until their mind becomes \\"comatose.\\" It was then that their Weyekin (Nez Perce word) revealed itself.

US 201 used to be New England Interstate Route 20 (NEI 20) in the 1920s. The original 1922 plan had NEI 20 starting in Portland. The southern half was later shifted east to start in Brunswick (the realignment may have been done prior to actual signing of the route.) The southern end of the original NEI 20 is now SR 100 from Portland to Augusta. The Brunswick end of the original NEI 20 intersected with NEI 1 (which is now US 1), which remained the southern terminus of US 201 until the construction of the US 1 freeway, at which point its terminus was moved to its current location on SR 24. Since its designation in 1926, US 201 has only undergone one major realignment. The original highway used to run through Norridgewock, Anson, and Madison on its way to Solon. In 1954, US 201 was moved to a new eastern alignment which completely bypasses this area and the existing alignment was redesignated US 201A. US 201 has also undergone various other minor route adjustments, but largely maintains its original 1926 routing.

The southern terminus of US 201A is at US 2, US 201 and State Route 104 in Skowhegan. The northern terminus is at US 201 in Anson, a terminus it shares with State Route 8. US 201A is also part of the Arnold Highway (named for Benedict Arnold), established in 1931 over the original US 201. US 201A is completely overlapped with other routes due to various realignments of the routes signed over it. = Route description = US 201A begins in Skowhegan just south of the Kennebec River, at an intersection with US 2, US 201, and SR 104 (which has its northern terminus here). US 201A begins overlapped with US 2 and the two routes proceed southwest along the southern bank of the river on the way to Norridgewock. Upon reaching town, the highway intersects with SR 8 and SR 139. SR 139 has its western terminus at this intersection while SR 8 northbound joins the concurrency. Just to the west, US 2 splits off to the southwest, while US 201A goes to the northwest with SR 8 in tow. US 201A and SR 8 are cosigned for the remainder of their lengths. US 201A and SR 8 continue along the riverbank, turning north into Madison and intersecting with SR 43 and SR 148.

Codifying a language can vary from case to case and depends on the stage of standardization that might have already occurred naturally. It typically means to develop a writing system, set up normative rules for grammar, orthography, pronunciation, and usage of vocabulary as well as publish grammar books, dictionaries and similar guidelines. In cases where several variants exist for a specific aspect, e.g. different ways of spelling a word, decisions on which variant is going to be the standard one have to be made. In some countries such codification is done by a body constituted by the state, such as the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Codification often happens due to new inventions, changes in values or other cultural influences. After the process of decolonialization, many African states had to decide whether they wanted to keep the colonial language or chose one (or more) of their indigenous language varieties as official languages, which made language planning necessary. In a well-known model of language planning by Einar Haugen, codification is only the second step. Step one is the selection process, step three is the implementation of the changes in society and step four is the elaboration of vocabulary (especially technical terms).http://ofeliagarciadotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/planning- spanish.pdf In the process of language planning, two major levels exist: corpus planning and status planning (Heinz Kloss). Codification is part of the corpus planning of a language, because the \\"body\\" of the language itself is being planned as opposed to status planning, where the prestige and usage of a language is enhanced:Holmes 2001, p. 102 *Corpus planning: Codification of a language (step 2); elaborating its functions to meet language needs (step 4) *Status planning: Selection of a language (step 1); implementing its functions by spreading it (step 3) Whether the codification is successful depends heavily on its acceptance by the population as well as its form of implementation by the government, e.g. promoting its prestige and spread, teaching the codified norm in school and language courses, and so on.

George Smiley must reconstruct an intelligence service in order to run a successful offensive espionage operation to save the service from being dismantled by the government. In 1977, the book won the Gold Dagger award for the best crime novel of the year and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. The Honourable Schoolboy is the second novel in the omnibus titled either Smiley Versus Karla or The Quest for Karla. Chronology This is the sixth le Carr√© spy novel featuring George Smiley. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People were later published as an omnibus edition titled Smiley Versus Karla in 1982. Plot In 1974 George Smiley, the chief of the British secret intelligence service referred to as The Circus, is repairing the damage done to their operations by double agent Bill Haydon and looking for opportunities to target Karla, the Moscow Centre spymaster. Smiley and analysts Connie Sachs and Doc di Salis look into investigations suppressed by the outed mole and find that a historic investigation of a money laundering operation in Laos by Sam Collins could indicate a Moscow intelligence operation. Smiley dispatches Jerry Westerby, a newspaper reporter and occasional Circus operative, to Hong Kong under the guise of a sports journalist. Westerby traces the Soviet money to Drake Ko, a local businessman with links to both the criminal underworld and the British establishment. London establishes that Drake Ko has a brother, Nelson, who is a high-ranking Chinese official and who has been spying on the Chinese for the Soviets. Westerby, following up leads provided by London, interviews Drake's English mistress Lizzie Worthington and discovers that Drake has been attempting to set-up an illicit air route into China. Charlie Marshall and Tiny Ricardo (both pilots and smugglers) were approached by Drake to carry opium into China, and return with a package. The flights were never completed, and Smiley surmises that the package was Nelson, who wished to defect from China. The money supplied by Moscow was intended for Nelson, to be accessed after he left China. Nelson would be a prime intelligence source on both Soviet and Chinese capabilities and political maneuverings between London and Washington hamper the investigation. It is finally agreed that the Circus will run the operation to capture Nelson and interrogate him afterwards, with all information shared with the United States. Smiley instructs Westerby to become more pro-active in his investigations, forcing Drake to move forwards with his plans to extract Nelson. In the course of this Westerby travels in and out of war-torn Vietnam, Ricardo tries to kill Westerby, and two of his colleagues in Hong Kong are murdered. Westerby becomes increasingly stressed and begins to obsess over Lizzie's situation, the ethics of the operation and Western involvement in Asia. Sam Collins has blackmailed Lizzie into bugging and informing on Drake. The Circus now has enough information to predict Drake's plan, which replicates his own escape from China via sea. Westerby is ordered to return to London. Westerby ignores this and contacts Lizzie to warn her of the danger she is in. Smiley along with Circus and CIA operatives arrive in Hong Kong to oversee the final stages of the operation. Smiley and his men encounter Westerby and try to force him to board a plane but Westerby escapes and with Lizzie's help, reaches the rendezvous point where Drake will meet with his brother. Westerby warns Drake of the plans of the intelligence agencies in an effort to protect Lizzie from reprisal and to have an opportunity to be with her. Drake does not heed Westerby's warning; at their appointed meeting place on the beach, CIA forces seize Nelson, and Westerby is killed by Fawn, a Circus operative, on Smiley's orders. In the aftermath, the CIA, and not the Circus, detain and interrogate Nelson. The success of the operation yields top Circus jobs for Collins, who becomes (temporary) Chief of the Circus. Smiley and Connie Sachs are retired and most of the older generation of Circus personnel are moved on. In the aftermath of the debacle, Peter Guillam contemplates the possibility that Smiley allowed the CIA to gain the upper hand so as to have himself removed as head of the Circus.

In 1983 the BBC adapted The Honourable Schoolboy to radio. Martin Jarvis played Jerry Westerby and Peter Vaughan played George Smiley.

A bilinear form is linear in each of its arguments, but a sesquilinear form allows one of the arguments to be \\"twisted\\" in a semilinear manner, thus the name; which originates from the Latin numerical prefix sesqui- meaning \\"one and a half\\". The basic concept of the dot product ‚Äì producing a scalar from a pair of vectors ‚Äì can be generalized by allowing a broader range of scalar values and, perhaps simultaneously, by widening the definition of a vector. A motivating special case is a sesquilinear form on a complex vector space, . This is a map that is linear in one argument and \\"twists\\" the linearity of the other argument by complex conjugation (referred to as being antilinear in the other argument). This case arises naturally in mathematical physics applications. Another important case allows the scalars to come from any field and the twist is provided by a field automorphism. An application in projective geometry requires that the scalars come from a division ring (skew field), , and this means that the \\"vectors\\" should be replaced by elements of a -module. In a very general setting, sesquilinear forms can be defined over -modules for arbitrary rings . Convention Conventions differ as to which argument should be linear. In the commutative case, we shall take the first to be linear, as is common in the mathematical literature, except in the section devoted to sesquilinear forms on complex vector spaces. There we use the other convention and take the first argument to be conjugate-linear (i.e. antilinear) and the second to be linear. This is the convention used mostly by physicistsfootnote 1 in Anthony Knapp Basic Algebra (2007) pg. 255 and originates in Dirac's bra‚Äìket notation in quantum mechanics. In the more general noncommutative setting, with right modules we take the second argument to be linear and with left modules we take the first argument to be linear. Complex vector spaces :Assumption: In this section, sesquilinear forms are antilinear (resp. linear) in their first (resp. second) argument. Over a complex vector space a map is sesquilinear if :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\varphi(x + y, z + w) = \\\\varphi(x, z) + \\\\varphi(x, w) + \\\\varphi(y, z) + \\\\varphi(y, w)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\varphi(a x, b y) = \\\\overline{a}b\\\\,\\\\varphi(x,y)\\\\end{align} for all in and all in . is the complex conjugate of . A complex sesquilinear form can also be viewed as a complex bilinear map :\\\\overline{V} \\\\times V \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} where is the complex conjugate vector space to . By the universal property of tensor products these are in one-to-one correspondence with complex linear maps :\\\\overline{V} \\\\otimes V \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C}. For a fixed in the map is a linear functional on (i.e. an element of the dual space ). Likewise, the map is a conjugate-linear functional on . Given any complex sesquilinear form on we can define a second complex sesquilinear form via the conjugate transpose: :\\\\psi(w,z) = \\\\overline{\\\\varphi(z,w)}. In general, and will be different. If they are the same then is said to be Hermitian. If they are negatives of one another, then is said to be skew-Hermitian. Every sesquilinear form can be written as a sum of a Hermitian form and a skew- Hermitian form. = Matrix representation = If is a finite-dimensional complex vector space, then relative to any basis } of , a sesquilinear form is represented by a matrix , by the column vector , and by the column vector : :\\\\varphi(w,z) = \\\\varphi \\\\left(\\\\sum_i w_i e_i, \\\\sum_j z_j e_j \\\\right) = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j \\\\overline{w_i} z_j \\\\varphi(e_i, e_j) = {\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{w}}}^\\\\mathrm{T} \\\\mathbf{\\\\Phi} \\\\mathbf{z} . The components of are given by . = Hermitian form = :The term Hermitian form may also refer to a different concept than that explained below: it may refer to a certain differential form on a Hermitian manifold. A complex Hermitian form (also called a symmetric sesquilinear form), is a sesquilinear form such that :h(w,z) = \\\\overline{h(z, w)}. The standard Hermitian form on is given (again, using the \\"physics\\" convention of linearity in the second and conjugate linearity in the first variable) by :\\\\langle w,z \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\overline{w_i} z_i. More generally, the inner product on any complex Hilbert space is a Hermitian form. A minus sign is introduced in the Hermitian form w w^* - z z^* to define the group SU(1,1). A vector space with a Hermitian form is called a Hermitian space. The matrix representation of a complex Hermitian form is a Hermitian matrix. A complex Hermitian form applied to a single vector :z_h = h(z, z) is always real. One can show that a complex sesquilinear form is Hermitian iff the associated quadratic form is real for all . = Skew-Hermitian form = A complex skew-Hermitian form (also called an antisymmetric sesquilinear form), is a complex sesquilinear form such that :s(w,z) = -\\\\overline{s(z, w)}. Every complex skew-Hermitian form can be written as times a Hermitian form. The matrix representation of a complex skew-Hermitian form is a skew-Hermitian matrix. A complex skew-Hermitian form applied to a single vector :z_s = s(z, z) is always pure imaginary. Over a division ring This section applies unchanged when the division ring is commutative. More specific terminology then also applies: the division ring is a field, the anti-automorphism is also an automorphism, and the right module is a vector space. The following applies to a left module with suitable reordering of expressions. =Definition= A -sesquilinear form over a right -module is a bi-additive map with an associated anti-automorphism of a division ring such that, for all in and all in , :\\\\varphi(x \\\\alpha, y \\\\beta) = \\\\sigma(\\\\alpha) \\\\, \\\\varphi(x, y) \\\\, \\\\beta . The associated anti-automorphism for any nonzero sesquilinear form is uniquely determined by . =Orthogonality= Given a sesquilinear form over a module and a subspace (submodule) of , the orthogonal complement of with respect to is :W^{\\\\perp}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in M \\\\mid \\\\varphi (\\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{w})=0,\\\\ \\\\forall \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\in W\\\\\\\\} . Similarly, is orthogonal to with respect to , written (or simply if can be inferred from the context), when . This relation need not be symmetric, i.e. does not imply (but see ' below). =Reflexivity= A sesquilinear form is reflexive if, for all in , :\\\\varphi(x, y) = 0 implies \\\\varphi(y, x) = 0. That is, a sesquilinear form is reflexive precisely when the derived orthogonality relation is symmetric. =Hermitian variations= A -sesquilinear form is called -Hermitian if there exists in such that, for all in , :\\\\varphi(x, y) = \\\\sigma ( \\\\varphi (y, x)) \\\\, \\\\varepsilon . If , the form is called -Hermitian, and if , it is called -anti- Hermitian. (When is implied, respectively simply Hermitian or anti-Hermitian.) For a nonzero -Hermitian form, it follows that for all in , : \\\\sigma ( \\\\varepsilon ) = \\\\varepsilon^{-1} : \\\\sigma ( \\\\sigma ( \\\\alpha ) ) = \\\\varepsilon \\\\alpha \\\\varepsilon^{-1} . It also follows that is a fixed point of the map . The fixed points of this map from a subgroup of the additive group of . A -Hermitian form is reflexive, and every reflexive -sesquilinear form is -Hermitian for some . ‚Äì Sesquilinear form at EOM ‚Äì In the special case that is the identity map (i.e., ), is commutative, is a bilinear form and . Then for the bilinear form is called symmetric, and for is called skew- symmetric.When , skew-symmetric and symmetric bilinear forms coincide since then . In all cases, alternating bilinear forms are a subset of skew-symmetric bilinear forms, and need not be considered separately. =Example= Let be the three dimensional vector space over the finite field , where is a prime power. With respect to the standard basis we can write and and define the map by: :\\\\varphi(x, y) = x_1 y_1{}^q + x_2 y_2{}^q + x_3 y_3{}^q. The map is an involutory automorphism of . The map is then a -sesquilinear form. The matrix associated to this form is the identity matrix. This is a Hermitian form. In projective geometry :Assumption: In this section, sesquilinear forms are antilinear (resp. linear) in their second (resp. first) argument. In a projective geometry , a permutation of the subspaces that inverts inclusion, i.e. : for all subspaces , of , is called a correlation. A result of Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) shows that the correlations of desarguesian projective geometries correspond to the nondegenerate sesquilinear forms on the underlying vector space. A sesquilinear form is nondegenerate if for all in (if and) only if . To achieve full generality of this statement, and since every desarguesian projective geometry may be coordinatized by a division ring, Reinhold Baer extended the definition of a sesquilinear form to a division ring, which requires replacing vector spaces by -modules. (In the geometric literature these are still referred to as either left or right vector spaces over skewfields.)Baer's terminology gives a third way to refer to these ideas, so he must be read with caution. Over arbitrary rings The specialization of the above section to skewfields was a consequence of the application to projective geometry, and not intrinsic to the nature of sesquilinear forms. Only the minor modifications needed to take into account the non-commutativity of multiplication are required to generalize the arbitrary field version of the definition to arbitrary rings. Let be a ring, an -module and an antiautomorphism of . A map is -sesquilinear if :\\\\varphi(x + y, z + w) = \\\\varphi(x, z) + \\\\varphi(x, w) + \\\\varphi(y, z) + \\\\varphi(y, w) :\\\\varphi(c x, d y) = c \\\\, \\\\varphi(x,y) \\\\, \\\\sigma(d) for all in and all in . An element is orthogonal to another element with respect to the sesquilinear form (written ) if . This relation need not be symmetric, i.e. does not imply . A sesquilinear form is reflexive (or orthosymmetric) if implies for all in . A sesquilinear form is Hermitian if there exists such that :\\\\varphi(x, y) = \\\\sigma(\\\\varphi(y, x)) for all in . A Hermitian form is necessarily reflexive, and if it is nonzero, the associated antiautomorphism is an involution (i.e. of order 2). Since for an antiautomorphism we have for all in , if , then must be commutative and is a bilinear form. In particular, if, in this case, is a skewfield, then is a field and is a vector space with a bilinear form. An antiautomorphism can also be viewed as an isomorphism , where is the opposite ring of , which has the same underlying set and the same addition, but whose multiplication operation () is defined by , where the product on the right is the product in . It follows from this that a right (left) -module can be turned into a left (right) -module, . Thus, the sesquilinear form can be viewed as a bilinear form .

It was based partially on the GM X platform, which was used for compact applications instead of the sporting intent of the F-Body. The only two vehicles to have been built using the F-Body platform are the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird. The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number for an F-body car is \\"F\\", on Fourth Generation vehicles. Earlier Camaros and Firebirds had differing VIN codes, but are now commonly referred to as F-bodies. First Generation, 1967‚Äì1969 The first F-body cars were produced in 1966 for the 1967 model year, as GM's response to the Ford Mustang. Originally designed strictly as the platform for the Camaro, Pontiac engineers were given a short amount of time prior to the Camaro's release to produce a version that matched their corporate styling as well. The F-Body was available as both a hardtop coupe and a cloth-top convertible. As was GM policy at the time, Chevrolet and Pontiac both installed their own engines; however, the engine lineups were similar. Both cars could be had with either division's base inline six- cylinder engine, a V8 engine of approximately 5.3 liters (327 cu in for Chevrolet, 326 cu in for Pontiac), or a larger V8 engine of approximately 6.6 liters (396 cu in for Chevrolet, 400 cu in for Pontiac). Due to delays with the design of the second-generation car, the 1969 models were produced longer than usual. Second Generation, 1970‚Äì1981 The second generation F-body cars were actually released in February 1970, due to extensive delays in the design and production of the new body style. Both cars grew considerably, with fairly drastic changes in styling to match each brand's updated styling across the lineup. Only Pontiac received engine options in the 7.5 L range in the earlier years of the second generation - (454 cu in for Chevrolet is in technical manuals, but was never produced), 455 cu in for Pontiac. However, this engine option would be discontinued as emissions and fuel-economy restrictions made their production costs prohibitive. Performance continued to decline through 1981, as power levels dropped and weight increased. Third Generation, 1982‚Äì1992 The third generation of the F-Body was introduced for 1982, as a major redesign with a more modern look and a lighter, better-handling car. In a move that would later happen across almost all GM models, the Firebird switched from Pontiac-designed engines to the same Chevrolet engines that powered the Camaro. This was also the first generation of F-Body to be available with a four-cylinder, the Iron Duke. The last Firebird to be built with an engine not available in the Camaro was the 1989 Turbo Trans Am, which had a turbocharged 3.8 L Buick V6, derived from the Buick Regal. Fourth Generation, 1993‚Äì2002 The fourth and final generation of F-body was released in 1993. It was an extensive revision to the third generation car, instead of a clean-sheet design. It was produced until the platform was canceled at the end of the 2002 model year. Unlike most of the years past, the engine choices were simplified considerably; each year, on both the Camaro and the Firebird, there was only one V6 and one V8 available. For 1993 to 1995, the V6 was the 3.4 L (208 cu in) 60¬∞; 1996‚Äì2002 cars received the 3.8L (231 cu in) 3800 Series II V6. 1993‚Äì1997 V8 cars shipped with the 5.7L (350 cu in) LT1, while 1998‚Äì2002 cars received the 5.7L (346 cu in) LS1. Both engines were available with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. V6 engines with a manual transmission had a five-speed unit; the manual for V8 cars was the T-56 six- speed, manufactured by either Borg-Warner or Tremec. An optional Hurst- supplied shifter was also available on V8 models. The fifth-generation Camaro was released in 2010 (after a seven-year layoff) as a 2010 model, using the Zeta chassis, with a VIN code of \\"F\\". According to GM, and contrary to rumors of a Firebird companion, no accompanying Pontiac model was planned before the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand in 2009. The sixth generation of the Camaro utilizes the GM Alpha platform shared with the Cadillac ATS and CTS.

With the waning of Jain influence during the 14th-century Vijayanagara empire, a new Vaishnava literature grew rapidly in the 15th century; the devotional movement of the itinerant Haridasa saints marked the high point of this era. After the decline of the Vijayanagara empire in the 16th century, Kannada literature was supported by the various rulers, including the Wodeyars of the Kingdom of Mysore and the Nayakas of Keladi. In the 19th century, some literary forms, such as the prose narrative, the novel, and the short story, were borrowed from English literature. Modern Kannada literature is now widely known and recognised: during the last half century, Kannada language authors have received eight Jnanpith awards, 63 Sahitya Akademi awards and 9 Sahitya Akademi Fellowships in India.Murthy (1997), p. 190 The Halmidi inscription, usually dated to the fifth century, is the earliest example of written Kannada.See Discovery and dating of the Halmidi inscription. Content and genre In the early period and beginning of the medieval period, between the 9th and 13th centuries, writers were predominantly Jains and Lingayats. Jains were the earliest known cultivators of Kannada literature, which they dominated until the 12th century, although a few works by Lingayats from that period have survived. Jain authors wrote about Tirthankaras and other aspects of religion. The Veerashaiva authors wrote about Shiva, his 25 forms, and the expositions of Shaivism. Lingayat poets belonging to the vachana sahitya tradition advanced the philosophy of Basava from the 12th century. During the period between the 13th and 15th centuries, there was decline in Jain writings and an increase in the number of works from the Lingayat tradition; there were also contributions from Vaishnava writers. Thereafter, Lingayat and Vaishnava writers dominated Kannada literature. Vaishnava writers focused on the Hindu epics ‚Äì the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata ‚Äì as well as Vedanta and other subjects from the Puranic traditions.Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 17 The devotional songs of the Haridasa poets, performed to music, were first noted in the 15th century. Writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period. An important change during the Bhakti \\"devotion\\" period starting in the 12th century was the decline of court literature and the rise in popularity of shorter genres such as the vachana and kirthane, forms that were more accessible to the common man.Shiva Prakash (1997) p. 163 Writings eulogising kings, commanders and spiritual heroes waned, with a proportional increase in the use of local genres. Kannada literature moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with musicality being its hallmark, although some poets continued to use the ancient champu form of writing as late as the 17th century.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 167, 202 Kannada poetry on stone‚Äì7th century Kappe Arabhatta inscription The champu Sanskritic metre (poems in verses of various metres interspersed with paragraphs of prose, also known as champu-kavya) was the most popular written form from the 9th century onwards, although it started to fall into disuse in the 12th century. Other Sanskritic metres used were the saptapadi (seven line verse), the ashtaka (eight line verse) and the shataka (hundred-line verse).Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 248Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 210 There were numerous translations and adaptations of Sanskrit writings into Kannada and, to a lesser extent, from Kannada into Sanskrit. The medieval period saw the development of literary metres indigenous to the Kannada language. These included the tripadi (three- line verse, in use from the 7th century), one of the oldest native metres; the shatpadi (six-line verse, first mentioned by Nagavarma I in Chhandombudhi of c. 984 and in use from 1165), of which six types exist; the ragale (lyrical narrative compositions, in use from 1160); the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung with a musical instrument, in use from 1232) and the akkara which came to be adopted in some Telugu writings.Rice E.P. (1921), p. 59Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), p. 203Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 27Sahitya Akademi (1996), pp. 4002‚Äì4003 There were rare interactions with Tamil literature, as well.Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 29 Though religious literature was prominent, literary genres including romance, fiction, erotica, satire, folk songs, fables and parables, musical treatises and musical compositions were popular. The topics of Kannada literature included grammar, philosophy, prosody, rhetoric, chronicles, biography, history, drama and cuisine, as well as dictionaries and encyclopedias.Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 61‚Äì64Karmarkar (1947), p. 124 According to critic Joseph T. Shipley, over fifty works on scientific subjects including medicine, mathematics and astrology have been written in the Kannada language.Shipley (2007), p. 528 Kannada literature of this period was mainly written on palm leaves. However, more than 30,000 more durable inscriptions on stone (known as shilashasana) and copper plates (known as tamrashasana) have survived to inform modern students of the historical development of Kannada literature.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1717 The Shravanabelagola inscription of Nandisena (7th century), Kappe Arabhatta inscription (c. 700), and the Hummacha and Soraba inscriptions (c. 800) are good examples of poetry in tripadi metre,Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4392 and the Jura (Jabalpur) inscription of King Krishna III (964) is regarded as an epigraphical landmark of classical Kannada composition, containing poetic diction in kanda metre, a form consisting of a group of stanzas or chapters.Kamath (1980), p. 83 Elegiac poetry on hundreds of veeragallu and maastigallu (hero stones) written by unknown poets in the kanda and the vritta (commentary) metre mourn the death of heroes who sacrificed their lives and the bravery of women who performed sati.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1150 According to the scholar T. V. Venkatachala Sastry, the book Karnataka Kavicharitre compiled by Kannada scholar R. Narasimhachar lists over one thousand anonymous pieces of Kannada literature that cover an array of topics under religious and secular categories. Some fifty Vachana poets are known only by the pen names (ankita) used in their poems. Most Jain writings included in the list are from the period 1200‚Äì1450 CE, while Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writings are from later periods. Secular topics include mathematics, medicine, science of horses and elephants, architecture, geography and hydrology.Sahtiya Akademi (1987), pp. 183‚Äì184 The pace of change towards more modern literary styles gained momentum in the early 19th century. Kannada writers were initially influenced by the modern literature of other languages, especially English.Murthy (1997), p. 167 Modern English education and liberal democratic values inspired social changes, intertwined with the desire to retain the best of traditional ways.Kamath (2001), pp. 277‚Äì278 New genres including short stories, novels, literary criticism, and essays, were embraced as Kannada prose moved toward modernisation.Murthy (1997), pp. 189‚Äì190 Classical period =Rashtrakuta court= A stanza from Kavirajamarga (c. 850) in Kannada praising the people for their literary skills The reign of the imperial Rashtrakutas and their powerful feudatory, the Gangas, marks the beginning of the classical period of writings in the Kannada language under royal patronage, and the end of the age of Sanskrit epics.Kamath (1980), p. 89 There was an emphasis on the adoption of Sanskritic models while retaining elements of local literary traditions, a style that prevailed in Kannada literature throughout the classical period.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1699 Kavirajamarga, written during this period, is a treatise on the Kannada speaking people, their poetry and their language.Rice B.L. (1897), p. 326 A portion of the writing qualifies as a practical grammar. It describes defective and corrective examples (the \\"do's and don't's\\") of versification and native composition styles recognised by earlier poets (puratana kavis). These composition meters are the bedande, the chattana and the gadyakatha ‚Äì compositions written in various interspersed metres. In some contexts, the term puravcharyar, which may refer to previous grammarians or rhetoricians, have also been mentioned.Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474‚Äì1475 Some historians attribute Kavirajamarga to the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha I, but others believe that the book may have been inspired by the king and co-authored or authored in full by Srivijaya, a Kannada language theorist and court poet.Rice E.P., (1921), pp. 25, 28Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 18Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474, 1699 The earliest existing prose piece in old Kannada is Vaddaradhane (\\"Worship of Elders\\", 9th century) by Shivakotiacharya.Sastri (1955), p. 356 It contains 19 lengthy stories, some in the form of fables and parables, such as \\"The Sage and the Monkey\\". Inspired by the earlier Sanskrit writing Brihatkatha Kosha, it is about Jain tenets and describes issues of rebirth, karma, the plight of humans on earth, and social issues of the time such as education, trade and commerce, magic, superstition, and the condition of women in society.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1253 The works of Jain writers Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna, collectively called the \\"three gems of Kannada literature\\", heralded the age of classical Kannada in the 10th century. Pampa, who wrote Adipurana in 941, is regarded as one of the greatest Kannada writers.Bhat (1993), p. 105 Written in champu style, Adipurana narrates the life history of the first Jain Thirtankar, Rishabhadeva. In this spiritual saga, Rishabhadeva's soul moves through a series of births before attaining emancipation in a quest for the liberation of his soul from the cycle of life and death.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1180 Pampa's other classic, Vikramarjuna Vijaya (or Pampa Bharata, 941), is loosely based on the Hindu epic the Mahabharata.Rice E.P. (1921), p. 31 Sri Ponna, patronised by King Krishna III, wrote Santipurana (950), a biography of the 16th Jain Tirthankar Shantinatha. He earned the title Ubhaya Kavichakravathi (\\"supreme poet in two languages\\") for his command of both Kannada and Sanskrit.Narasimhacharya 1934, p. 18Kamath (1980), p. 90Rice, E.P. (1921), pp. 31‚Äì32 Although Sri Ponna borrowed significantly from Kalidasa's earlier works, his Santipurana is considered an important Jain purana. =Chalukya court= Inscribed handwriting of 10th-century poet Ranna reads Kavi Ratna (gem among poets) in Shravanabelagola From the late 10th century, Kannada literature made considerable progress under the patronage of the new overlords of the Deccan, the Western Chalukyas and their feudatories: the Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris of Kalyanis, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri and Silharas of Karad.Kamath (1980), pp. 114, 132‚Äì134, 143‚Äì144 The skill of Kannada poets was appreciated in distant lands. King Bhoja of Malwa in central India presented Nagavarma I, a writer of prosody and romance classics, with horses as a mark of his admiration.Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 68 Ranna was the court poet of the Western Chalukya kings Tailapa II and Satyashraya. He was also patronised by Attimabbe, a devout Jain woman. Ranna's poetic writings reached their zenith with Sahasa Bhima Vijaya (\\"Victory of the bold Bhima\\", also called Gada Yudda or \\"Battle of Clubs\\", 982), which describes the conflict between Bhima and Duryodhana in his version of the Mahabharata epic, one of the earliest poetic elegies in the Kannada language.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 620Rice E.P. (1921), p. 32Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1149 Unlike Pampa, who glorified Arjuna and Karna in his writing, Ranna eulogised his patron King Satyashraya and favourably compared him to Bhima, whom he crowned at the end of the Mahabharata war. His other well-known writing is the Ajitha purana (993), which recounts the life of the second Jain Tirthankar Ajitanatha.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1024 Ranna was bestowed the title Kavi Chakravathi (\\"Emperor among poets\\") by his patron king. Among grammarians, Nagavarma-II, Katakacharya (poet laureate) of the Chalukya king Jagadhekamalla II made significant contributions with his works in grammar, poetry, prosody, and vocabulary; these are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged.Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 64‚Äì65,Rice E.P. (1921), p. 34 Among his other writings, the Kavyavalokana on grammar and rhetoric and the Karnataka Bhashabhushana (1145) on grammar are historically significant.Sastri 1955, p. 358 However, the discovery of Vardhamana Puranam (1042), which has been ascribed by some scholars to Nagavarma II, has created uncertainty about his actual lifetime since it suggests that he may have lived a century earlier and been patronised by Jayasimha II.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1475 Hoysala period Hero stone (virgal) with old Kannada elegiac inscription (1220) at the Ishwara temple in Arasikere, Karnataka In the late 12th century, the Hoysalas, a powerful hill tribe from the Malnad region in modern southern Karnataka, exploited the political uncertainty in the Deccan to gain dominance in the region south of the Krishna River in southern India.Derret and Coelho in Kamath (1980), pp. 124‚Äì126 A new chronological era was adopted, imperial titles were claimed and Kannada literature flourished with such noted scholars as Janna, Harihara, Rudrabhatta, Raghavanka, Keshiraja and others.Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 19‚Äì21 An important achievement during this period was the establishment of native metres in literature (the ragale, the tripadi, the sangatya and the shatpadi). Two renowned philosophers who lived during this time, Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya, influenced the culture of the region.Kamath (1980), pp. 50‚Äì52, 54‚Äì56 The conversion of the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana in the early 12th century from Jainism to Vaishnavism was to later prove a setback to Jain literature. In the decades to follow, Jain writers faced competition from the Veerashaivas, to which they responded with rebuttals,Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p. 366 and from the 15th century, from the writers of the Vaishnava cadre. These events changed the literary landscape of the Kannada-speaking region forever.Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 45‚Äì46Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 66 One of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the Vachana literary tradition, poet Harihara (or Harisvara) came from a family of karnikas (accountants), and worked under the patronage of King Narasimha I. He wrote Girijakalyana in ten sections following the Kalidasa tradition, employing the old Jain champu style, with the story leading to the marriage of Shiva and Parvati.Sastri (1955), pp. 361‚Äì362 In a deviation from the norm, Harihara avoided glorifying saintly mortals. He is credited with more than 100 poems in ragale metre, called the Nambiyanana ragale (or Shivaganada ragale, 1160) praising the saint Nambiyana and Virupaksha (a form of Hindu god Shiva).Rice E.P. (1921), p. 60 For his poetic talent, he has earned the honorific utsava kavi (\\"poet of exuberance\\"). Harihara's nephew, Raghavanka, was the first to introduce the shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his epic Harishchandra Kavya (1200), considered a classic despite occasionally violating strict rules of Kannada grammar.Sastri (1955), p. 362 Drawing on his skill as a dramatist, Raghavanka's story of King Harishchandra vividly describes the clash of personalities between sage Vishvamitra and sage Vashisht and between Harishchandra and Vishvamitra. It is believed that this interpretation of the story of Harishchandra is unique to Indian literature. The writing is an original and does not follow any established epic traditions.Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1181 In addition to Hoysala patronage, Raghavanka was honoured by Kakatiya king Prataparudra I. Rudrabhatta, a Smartha Brahmin (believer of monistic philosophy), was the earliest well-known Brahminical writer, under the patronage of Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II. Based on the earlier work of Vishnu Purana, he wrote Jagannatha Vijaya (1180) in the champu style, relating the life of Lord Krishna leading up to his fight with the demon Banasura.Sastri (1955), p. 364 In 1209, the Jain scholar and army commander Janna wrote Yashodhara Charite, a unique set of stories dealing with perversion. In one of the stories, a king intended to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to Mariamma, a local deity. After hearing the boys' tale, the king is moved to release them and renounce the practice of human sacrifice.Sastri (1955), pp. 358‚Äì359Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 43‚Äì44 In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi (\\"Emperor among poets\\") from King Veera Ballala II.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 20 His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), deals with the life of the 14th Tirthankar Ananthanatha. Vijayanagara period King Krishnadevaraya, patron of Vaishnava literature The 14th century saw major upheavals in geo-politics of southern India with Muslim empires invading from the north. The Vijayanagara Empire stood as a bulwark against these invasions and created an atmosphere conducive to the development of the fine arts.Kamath (1980), p. 157 In a golden age of Kannada literature, competition between Vaishnava and Veerashaiva writers was fierce and literary disputations between the two sects were common, especially in the court of King Deva Raya II. Acute rivalry led to \\"organised processions\\" in honour of the classics written by poets of the respective sects.Sastri (1955), p. 363 The king himself was no less a writer, the romantic stories Sobagina Sone (lit \\"The Drizzle of Beauty\\") and Amaruka are assigned to him.Sinopoli (2003) pp. 130‚Äì131 To this period belonged Kumara Vyasa (the pen name of Naranappa), a doyen of medieval epic poets and one of the most influential Vaishnava poets of the time. He was particularly known for his sophisticated use of metaphors and had even earned the title Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti (\\"Emperor of the land of Metaphors\\"). In 1430, he wrote the Gadugina Bharata, popularly known as Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari or Kumaravyasa Bharata in the Vyasa tradition. The work is a translation of the first ten chapters of the epic Mahabharata and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Lord Krishna, portraying all characters with the exception of Krishna to suffer from human foibles.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 37 An interesting aspect of the work is the sense of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marked a transition of Kannada literature to a more modern genre and heralded a new age combining poetic perfection with religious inspiration. The remaining parvas (chapters) of Mahabharata were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) in the court of King Krishnadevaraya. The poet named his work Krishnaraya Bharata after his patron king. Kumara Valmiki (1500) wrote the first complete brahminical adaptation of the epic Ramayana, called Torave Ramayana. According to the author, the epic he wrote merely narrated God Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. This writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the Yakshagana, which has made use of its verses as a script for enacting episodes from the great epic. In Valmiki's version of the epic, King Ravana is depicted as one of the suitors at Sita's Swayamvara (lit. a ceremony of \\"choice of a husband\\"). His failure to win the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, Hanuman, for all his services to Rama, is exalted to the status of \\"the next creator\\". Towards the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that his adversary is none other than the God Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 38‚Äì39 Chamarasa, a Veerashaiva poet, was a rival of Kumara Vyasa in the court of Devaraya II. His eulogy of the saint Allama Prabhu, titled Prabhulinga Lile (1430), was later translated into Telugu and Tamil at the behest of his patron king. In the story, the saint was considered an incarnation of Hindu God Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi. Interaction between Kannada and Telugu literatures, a trend which had begun in the Hoysala period, increased. Translations of classics from Kannada to Telugu and vice versa became popular. Well-known bilingual poets of this period were Bhima Kavi, Piduparti Somanatha and Nilakanthacharya. In fact, so well versed in Kannada were some Telugu poets, including Dhurjati, that they freely used many Kannada terms in their Telugu writings. It was because of this \\"familiarity\\" with Kannada, that the notable writer Srinatha even called his Telugu, \\"Kannada\\". This process of interaction between the two languages continued into the 19th century in the form of translations by bilingual writers.Srinatha called himself \\"Karnatadesakataka\\" (Narasimhacharya 1934, pp. 27‚Äì28) Mystic literature =Veerashaiva= Palm leaf with 11th‚Äì12th century Vachana poems in old Kannada Akka Mahadevi, 12th century female poet The bust of Basaveswara, unveiled in London in 2015, facing the UK Parliament In the late 12th century, the Kalachuris successfully rebelled against their overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed the capital Kalyani. During this turbulent period, a new religious faith called Veerashaivism (or Lingayatism) developed as a revolt against the existing social order of Hindu society. Some of the followers of this faith wrote literature called Vachana Sahitya (\\"Vachana literature\\") or Sharana Sahitya (\\"literature of the devotees\\") consisting of a unique and native form of poetry in free verse called Vachana.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 166‚Äì187Kamath (1980), p. 108 Basavanna (or Basava, 1134‚Äì1196), the prime minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration for this movement.Rice E.P. (1921), p. 42 Devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences at a centre for religious discussion called Anubhava Mantapa (\\"hall of experience\\") in Kalyani. Here, they expressed their devotion to God Shiva in simple vachana poems. These poems were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical, satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning, displaying a dramatic quality reminiscent of the dialogues of Plato.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1324Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 191 Basavanna, Allama Prabhu, Devara Dasimayya, Channabasava, Siddharama (1150), and Kondaguli Kesiraja are the best known among numerous poets (called Vachanakaras) who wrote in this genre. Akka Mahadevi was prominent among the several women poets; in addition to her poetry, she is credited with two short writings, Mantrogopya and Yogangatrividhi. Siddharama is credited with writings in tripadi metre and 1,379 extant poems (though he has claimed authorship of 68,000 poems).Rice B.L. in Sastri 1955, p. 361Shiva Prakash 1997, pp. 167‚Äì168, 178, 181Nagaraj, 2003, p. 348 The Veerashaiva movement experienced a setback with the assassination of King Bijjala and eviction of the sharanas (devotees) from Kalyani; further growth of Vachana poetry was curtailed until the 15th century when another wave of writings began under the patronage of the rulers of Vijayanagara.Kamath (2001), p. 153 Chieftain Nijaguna Shivayogi originated a new philosophy called Kaivalya, founded on the advaitha (monistic) philosophy of Adi Shankara, synthesised with an offshoot of the Veerashaiva faith. A prolific writer, Shivayogi composed devotional songs collectively known as the Kaivalya sahitya (or Tattva Padagalu, literally \\"songs of the pathway to emancipation\\"). His songs were reflective, philosophical and concerned with Yoga. Shivayogi also wrote a highly respected scientific encyclopaedia called the Vivekachintamani; it was translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century. The encyclopaedia includes entries on 1,500 topics and covers a wide range of subjects including poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1165 Other well-known poet saints of the Veerashaiva tradition include Muppina Sadakshari, a contemporary of Shivayogi, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara, Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it still needs to be studied. =Vaishnava= Kanaka Dasa (c. 1509‚Äì1609) The Vaishnava Bhakti (devotional) movement involving well-known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time made an indelible imprint on Kannada literature starting in the 15th century, inspiring a body of work called Haridasa Sahitya (\\"Haridasa literature\\"). Influenced by the Veerashaivism of the 12th century, this movement touched the lives of millions with its strong current of devotion. The Haridasas conveyed the message of Vedantic philosopher Madhvacharya to the common man through simple Kannada language in the form of devaranamas and kirthanas (devotional songs in praise of god).Sastri (1955), p. 365Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 200 The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples including Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, and Kanaka Dasa.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192‚Äì200 Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a prominent saint from distant Bengal, visited the region in 1510, further stimulating the devotional movement. Purandara Dasa (1484‚Äì1564), a wandering bard, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages, though only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various ragas, and often ending with a salutation to the Hindu deity Vittala, his compositions presented the essence of the Upanishads and the Puranas in simple yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn Carnatic music, and codified the musical composition forms svaravalis, alankaras (\\"figure of speech\\") and geethams. Owing to such contributions, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha (\\"Father of Carnatic Music\\").Moorthy (2001), p. 67Iyer (2006), p. 93Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 196‚Äì197 Kanaka Dasa (whose birth name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509‚Äì1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker who authored important writings such as Mohanatarangini (\\"River of Delight\\"), the story of the Hindu god Krishna in sangatya metre; Nrisimhastava, a work dealing with glory of god Narasimha; Nalacharita, the story of Nala, noted for its narration; and Hari Bhaktisara, a spontaneous writing on devotion in shatpadi metre. The latter writing, which deals with niti (morals), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (renunciation) has become popular as a standard book of learning for children.Rice E.P. (1921), p. 80 Kanaka Dasa authored a unique allegorical poem titled Ramadhanya Charitre (\\"Story of Rama's Chosen Grain\\"), which exalts ragi over rice. Apart from these classics, about 240 songs written by the Kanaka Dasa are available today.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 198‚Äì200 The Haridasa movement returned to prominence from the 17th through 19th centuries, producing as many as 300 poets in this genre; well-known among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682‚Äì1755), Gopala Dasa (1721‚Äì1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728‚Äì1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200‚Äì201 Over time, the movement's devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha (\\"Stories of Hari\\"). Similar developments were seen among the followers of the Veerashaiva faith who popularised the Shivakatha (\\"Stories of Shiva\\").Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1551 Mysore and Keladi period King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673‚Äì1704), writer and patron of Kannada literature With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kingdom of Mysore (‡≤Æ‡≥à‡≤∏‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤Æ‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ú‡≥ç‡≤Ø) (1565‚Äì1947) and the kingdom of the Keladi Nayakas (1565‚Äì1763) rose to power in the southern and western regions of modern Karnataka respectively. Production of literary texts covering various themes flourished in these courts.Nagaraj (2003) p. 377 The Mysore court was adorned by eminent writers who authored encyclopaedias, epics, and religious commentaries, and composers and musicians. The Keladi court is better known for writings on Veerashaiva doctrine.Nagaraj (2003), p. 378 The Mysore kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions.Pranesh (2003), preface chapter p. i‚ÄìiiiKamath (2001), pp. 229‚Äì230Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 23‚Äì26 A unique and native form of poetic literature with dramatic representation called Yakshagana gained popularity in the 18th century.Kamath (1980), p. 281 Geetha Gopala, a well- known treatise on music, is ascribed to King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673‚Äì1704), the earliest composer of the dynasty, who went by the honorific Sahitya Vidyanikasha Prastharam (\\"Expert in literature\\").Pranesh (2003), p. 20 Inspired by Jayadeva's Geetha Govinda in Sanskrit, it was written in saptapadi metre. This is the first writing to propagate the Vaishnava faith in the Kannada language.Pranesh (2003), p. 21 Also writing in this periodNarasimhacharya (1934), p. 24Prasad (1987), p. 16 was Sarvajna (lit. \\"The all knowing\\")‚Äîa mendicant and drifter Veerashaiva poet who left a deep imprint on Kannada speaking region and its people. His didactic Vachanas, penned in the tripadi metre, constitute some of Kannada's most celebrated works. With the exception of some early poems, his works focus on his spiritual quest as a drifter.Prasad (1987), pp. 9‚Äì10 The pithy Vachanas contain his observations on the art of living, the purpose of life and the ways of the world.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191 He was not patronised by royalty, nor did he write for fame; his main aim was to instruct people about morality.Prasad (1987), pp. 5‚Äì6 The writing of Brahmin author Lakshmisa (or Lakshmisha), a well-known story-teller and a dramatist, is dated to the mid-16th or late 17th century.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 59 The Jaimini Bharata, his version of the epic Mahabharata written in shatpadi metre, is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval period. A collection of stories, the poem includes the tale of the Sita Parityaga (\\"Repudiation of Sita\\"). The author successfully converted a religious story into a very human tale; it remains popular even in modern times.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182 The period also saw advances in dramatic works. Though there is evidence that theatre was known from the 12th century or earlier, modern Kannada theatre is traced to the rise of Yakshagana (a type of field play), which appeared in the 16th century.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077 The golden age of Yakshagana compositions was tied to the rule of King Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II (1704‚Äì1714). A polyglot, he authored 14 Yakshaganas in various languages, although all are written in the Kannada script.Pranesh (2003), p. 37‚Äì38 He is credited with the earliest Yakshaganas that included sangeeta (music), nataka (drama) and natya (dance).Pranesh (2003), p. 37 Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1794‚Äì1868), the ruler of the princely state of Mysore, was another prolific writer of the era.Pranesh (2003), p. 53 More than 40 writings are attributed to him, including a poetic romance called Saugandika Parinaya written in two versions, sangatya and a drama.Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 26 His reign signalled the shift from classical genres to modern literature which was to be complemented by the influence of colonial period of India. Modern period Maharaja and writer, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur (1940‚Äì1947) with Queen Elizabeth II The development of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century when Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III and his court poets moved away from the ancient champu form of prose toward prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's Mudramanjusha (\\"Seal Casket\\", 1823) is the first modern novel written in Kannada. Modern Kannada literature was cross-fertilized by the colonial period in India as well.,Murthy in George K.M(1992), p. 167 with translations of Kannada works and dictionaries into European languages as well as other Indian languages, and vice versa, and the establishment of European style newspapers and periodicals in Kannada. In addition, in the 19th century, interaction with European technology, including new printing techniques accelerated the development of modern literature. The first Kannada newspaper called Mangalore Samachara was published by Hermann M√∂gling in 1843; and the first Kannada periodical, Mysuru Vrittanta Bodhini was published by Bhashyam Bhashyacharya in Mysore around the same time. Hermann M√∂gling translated Kannada classics into a series called Bibliotheca Carnataca during 1848‚Äì1853.,Kamath (1980), p. 279 while British officers Benjamin L. Rice and J. H. Fleet edited and published critical editions of literary classics, contemporary folk ballads and inscriptions. Following the rich tradition of dictionaries in Kannada since the 11th century, the first dictionaries expressing meanings of Kannada words in European languages were published in the 19th century, the most prominent of them being Ferdinand Kittel's Kannada-English dictionary in 1894.Kamath (1980), p. 280 There was a push towards original works in prose narratives and a standardisation of prose during the late 19th century.Murthy (1992), pp. 168‚Äì169 Translations of works from English, Sanskrit and other Indian languages like Marathi and Bengali continued and accelerated. Lakshman Gadagkar's Suryakantha (1892) and Gulvadi Venkata Rao's Indira Bai (1899) signalled the move away from the highly stylised mores and aesthetics of prior Kannada works to modern prose, establishing the modern novel genre and fundamentally influencing the essay, literary criticism and drama genres. =Navodaya ‚Äì A period of modern literature= Ferdinand Kittel (1832‚Äì1903), Christian missionary and writer of Kannada-English dictionary At the dawn of the 20th century, B. M. Srikantaiah ('B. M. Sri'), regarded as the \\"Father of modern Kannada literature\\",Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1077‚Äì78 called for a new era of writing original works in modern Kannada while moving away from archaic Kannada forms. This paradigmatic shift spawned an age of prolificacy in Kannada literature and came to be dubbed the Navodaya (lit. 'A new rise') period‚Äîa period of awakening. B. M. Sri led the way with his English Geethagalu (\\"English Songs\\")‚Äîa collection of poems translated from English set the tone for more translations using a standardisation of a modern written idiom.Murthy (1992), pp. 170‚Äì171 Original and seminal works which drew greatly from native and folk traditions also emerged alongside the translations. Stalwarts like S. G. Narasimhachar, Panje Mangesha Rao and Hattiangadi Narayana Rao also contributed with celebrated efforts. Literary subjects now veered from discussing kings and gods to more humanistic and secular pursuits. Kannada writers experimented with several forms of western literature, the novel and the short story in particular. The novel found an early champion in Shivaram Karanth while another prominent writer, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar ('Masti'), laid the foundation for generations of story tellers to follow with his Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu (\\"A few Short Stories\\", 1920) and Sanna Kathegalu (\\"Short Stories\\", 1924).Murthy (1992), p. 172 The consolidation of modern drama was pioneered by T. P. Kailasam, with his Tollu Gatti (\\"The Hollow and the Solid\\", 1918). Kailasam followed this with Tali Kattoke Cooline (\\"Wages for tying the Mangalsutra\\"), a critique on the dowry system in marriage. His plays mainly focused on problems affecting middle class Brahmin families: the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women. Novels of the early 20th century promoted a nationalist consciousness in keeping with the political developments of the time. While Venkatachar and Galaganath translated Bankim Chandra and Harinarayana Apte respectively, Gulvadi Venkata Rao, Kerur Vasudevachar and M. S. Puttanna initiated the movement toward realistic novels with their works. Aluru Venkatarao's Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava had a profound influence on the movement for Karnataka's unification. ;1925‚Äì50 ‚Äì The Golden harvest x216px While the first quarter of the 20th century was a period of experiment and innovation, the succeeding quarter was one of creative achievement. This period saw the rise of acclaimed lyricists whose works combined native folk songs and the mystic poetry of the medieval vachanas and kirthanas with influences from modern English romantics.Murthy (1992), p. 173‚Äì175 D. R. Bendre, with his collection of 27 poems including such masterpieces as Gari (\\"Wing\\", 1932), Nadaleele (1938) and Sakhigeetha (1940), was perhaps the most outstanding Kannada lyricist of the period.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 413 His poems covered a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor.Murthy (1992), p. 173 Govinda Pai narrated the story of Christ's crucifixion in his work Golgotha (1931). The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three panegyrics in 1947; Vaishakhi, Prabhasa and Dehali, narrated the last days of the Buddha, God Krishna and Gandhi respectively.Das (1995), p. 148 His Hebberalu (\\"Thumb\\", 1946) dramatises the story of Drona and Ekalavya, characters from the epic Mahabharata. K.V. Puttappa ('Kuvempu'), who would subsequently become Kannada's first Jnanpith awardee, demonstrated great talent in writing blank verse with his magnum opus Sri Ramayana Darshanam (1949).Murthy (1992), p. 174 This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada epic poetry. The work, through the use of metaphors and similes, focuses on the concept that all living creatures will eventually evolve into perfect beings.Punekar in Sahity Akademi (1992), pp. 4159‚Äì4160 Other important works of the period are Masti's Navaratri and P. T. Narasimhachar's Hanathe. D. V. Gundappa's Mankuthimmana Kagga (\\"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\\", 1943) harkened back to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1057 A celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, K. S. Narasimhaswamy won critical acclaim for Mysore Mallige (\\"Mysore Jasmine\\", 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life.Murthy (1992), p. 175 Growth in poetic drama was inspired by B.M. Sri's Gadayuddha Natakam (1925), an adaptation of Ranna's medieval epic. While Kuvempu and B.M. Sri were inspired by old Kannada, Masti and later P. T. Narasimhachar ('Pu. Ti. Na') explored modern sensibilities in their Yashodhara (1938) and Ahalye (1940). The 1930s saw the emergence of Sriranga, who joined forces with Samsa and Kailasam to pen some of the most successful plays in Kannada.Murthy (1992), p. 176 Samsa completed his trilogy about Ranadhira Kantirava, a Mysore king of yore, with his Vijayanarasimha (1936) and Mantrashakti (1938). Kailasam's mastery over wit and stage rhetoric come to the fore in his Home Rule (1930) and Vaidyana Vyadi (\\"A Doctors Ailment\\", 1940) while he explores his serious side in Bhahishkara (1929); with Soole (\\"Prostitute\\", 1945), he unleashed his contempt for outdated quasi- religious mores. Societal ills were also examined in Bendre's Nageya Hoge (\\"Fumes of Laughter\\", 1936), and in Karanth's Garbhagudi (\\"Sanctum\\", 1932), which decried the exploitation of society in the name of religion.Murthy (1992), p. 177 The novel came of age during this period, with Karanth (Chomana Dudi, 1933), Masti (Subbanna, 1928) and Kuvempu (\\"Subbamma Heggadathi of Kanur\\", 1936) leading the charge.Murthy (1992), p. 178 Significantly, writers chose to carry on from where Puttanna, Gulvadi and Kerur had left off around the start of the 20th century rather than continue with popular translations in the style of Venkatachar and Galaganath. Aesthetic concerns replaced the didactic and a sense of form developed. Devudu Narasimha Shastri distinguished himself with his Antaranga (1931) and Mayura (1928); the former was a much acclaimed work which delved into the psychology of the protagonist, while the latter was a historical novel tracing the emergence of the Kadamba dynasty. Another high point of this period is Karanth's Marali Mannige (1942), the saga of three generations of a family, reflecting the social, cultural and economic developments of over a hundred years.Murthy (1992), p. 178‚Äì179 Literary criticism, which had its beginnings in the first quarter-century, also made significant progress. B.M. Sri's Kannada Sahitya Charitre (1947), Gundappa's Sahitya Shakti (1950), Masti's Adikavi Valmiki (1935), Bendre's Sahitya Hagu Vimarshe (\\"Literature and Criticism\\", 1932) and Krishna Shastry's Samskrita Nataka (1937) are particularly notable. The essay, another form adopted from western literature, was richly served by A N Murthy Rao (Hagaluganasugalu, 1937), Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar's ('Gorur') humorous Halliya Chitragalu (1930) and Karanth's Hucchu manassina Hattu mukhagalu (1948).Murthy (1992), p. 179 =Late Navodaya and the rise of the progressives= As the Navodaya period waxed, the Pragatishila (progressives) movement led by novelist A. N. Krishna Rao ('Anakru') gained momentum in the early 1940s.Murthy (1992), p. 183 This left-leaning school contended that literature must be an instrument of social revolution and considered the Navodaya to be the product of aesthetes, too puritanical to be of any social relevance. This movement drew both established and young writers into its fold and, while it produced no poetry or drama of special merit, its contributions to short story and novel forms were appreciable. Pragatishila was credited with broadening readers' horizons; works produced during this period dealt extensively with subjects of everyday life, rural themes and the common man. The language was less inhibited and made generous use of colloquialism and slang. Anakru himself was a prolific writer of novels but the best works of this school are attributed to T. R. Subba Rao ('Ta Ra Su'), Basavaraju Kattimani and Niranjana.The Growth of the Novel in India 1950‚Äì1980, P. K. Rajan, p. 112, 1989, T. R. Subba Rao initially wrote short stories, although he later turned his talents to novels, which were popular. His early novels, Purushavatara and Munjavininda Munjavu, told the stories of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcast.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4185 Best known among his novels‚Äîsome of whose plots are centred on his native Chitradurga‚Äîare Masanada Hoovu (\\"Flower from a cemetery\\"), a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historical novel Hamsa Gite (\\"Swan Song\\"), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of Chitradurga by Tipu sultan. Marked as its influence had been, the Pragatishila wave was already in decline by the close of the 1950s. Legendary writers of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the Navodaya style. In poetry, Bendre's Naku Tanti (\\"Four Strings\\", 1964) and Kuvempu's Aniketana (1964) stand out. V.K. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies of the more advanced western cultures in Indilla Nale (1965).Murthy (1992), pp. 179‚Äì180 Navodaya-style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Karanth's Mookajjiya Kanasugalu (\\"Mookajji's visions\\", 1968), where Karanth explored the origins of man's faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilisation. Kuvempu's Malegallali Madumagalu (\\"The Bride of the Hills\\", 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every level of society.Murthy (1992), p. 180 Masti's two classic novels of this era were Channabasavanayaka (1950), which describe the defeat of Bidanur's chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka's coast) by Haider Ali in the late 18th century, and Chickavirarajendra (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of Coorg (ruled by Chikka Virarajendra) to the British East India Company.Murthy (1992) p. 181 The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power appearing on the scene to restore order, but with its own imperialistic intentions.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 689 S. L. Bhyrappa, a charismatic young writer, first came to attention in the 1960s with his first novel Dharmasri, although it was his Vamsavriksha (\\"Family Tree\\", 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 429 Bhyrappa's best novel of the period was Grihabhanga (\\"Breaking of a Home\\", 1970), a story of a woman surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language.Murthy (1992), p. 182 His other important novel is Parva, a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 430 =Navya= Seated L to R: Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, D. V. Gundappa, Kuvempu, M. V. Seetharamiah, K. Shivaram Karanth, A.N. Krishna Rao (Anakru) and G.P. Rajarathnam In the 1950s, even as the Pragatishila merged back into the Navodaya mainstream, a new modernist school of writing called Navya emerged. Though formally inaugurated by V. K. Gokak with his Navya Kavitegalu (\\"Modern Poems\\", 1950), it was Gopalakrishna Adiga who best exemplified the ethos of the movement. Poetry and, later, the short story became the most effective vehicles of the movement. With the passing of the Gandhian era and its influences, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived. The Navya writers questioned the time- honoured standards of plot of the Navodaya; life was seen not as a pursuit of already existing values, but as an introspective search for them, occasionally narrated in stream of consciousness technique. Events and details were increasingly treated metaphorically and the short story grew closer to poetry.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4049Handbook of Twentieth-Century Literatures of India, Nalini Natarajan, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, p. 170, 1996, Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this form of expression with his Nadedu Banda Dari (\\"The Path Traversed\\", 1952) where he sought inspiration from T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden. His other well-known poems include Gondalapura (\\"Pandemonium\\", 1954) and Bhoota (1959).Murthy (1992), p. 184 G. S. Shivarudrappa made his mark in the Navya period with Mumbai Jataka (\\"A Horoscope of Bombay\\", 1966), which takes a closer look at urbanised society in Mumbai. A prot√©g√© of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa's fame came the peak of popularity of romantic poems with his Samagma (\\"Songs of Equanimity\\", 1951), poems distinguished by an idealistic bent. He continued to write poems in the same vein, although in his later poems there is a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god's creation.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4031 His critical essay, Anuranana (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets. K. S. Narasimhaswamy remained prominent through this era, writing such landmark poems as Silalate (\\"The Sculptured Creeper\\", 1958) and Gadiyaradangadiya Munde (\\"Before the Clock Shop\\").Murthy (1992), p. 665 Chandrashekhara Kambar, Chandrashekar Patil, P. Lankesh, and K. S. Nissar Ahmed are among the best- known later generation Navya poets.Murthy (1992), p. 185 Outstanding playwrights from this period are Girish Karnad, P. Lankesh, Chandrashekhara Kambara and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad's Tughlaq (1964) portrays violence caused by idealism gone astray. Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th-century Sultan of Delhi, Mohammad Tughlaq in contrasting styles, a tyrannical and whimsical ruler and at the same time, an idealist who sought the best for his subjects.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4403 Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society. The most acclaimed novel of the era was Samaskara by U.R.Anantha Murthy (1965). The novel details the search for new values and identity by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who had sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his heretic adversary.Murthy (1992), p. 187 Another notable work is the Swarupa (1966) by Poornachandra Tejaswi. Anantha Murthy's Prasne (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including Ghatashraddha, which describes the tragedy that befell a young pregnant widow, from the point of view of a boy. His collection Mouni (1973) includes the stories Navilugulu (\\"Peacocks\\") and Clip Joint.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 165 The Navya movement was not without its critics. The doubt, dilemmas and indecision in every turn of the plot resulted in increasingly sophisticated and complex narrations, which some readers found uninteresting. It was derided as an intellectual exercise of the middle class intelligentsia; in its extreme sophistication, it was thought to have lost its touch with realities of life. This led to a gradual waning of the Navya school as it was supplanted by emerging waves of Navyottara, Bandaya (protest) and Dalit schools. Post-modern trends From the early 1970s, a segment of writers including many \\"Navya\\" writers started to write novels and stories that were anti-\\"Navya\\". This genre was called Navyottara and sought to fulfil a more socially responsible role.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4308Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4309 The best-known authors in this form of writing were Poornachandra Tejaswi and Devanur Mahadeva. In his preface to Abachurina Post Office, Tejaswi expressed a path breaking observation towards then prevailing literary movements. Tejaswi won the \\"most creative novel of the year\\" for his Karvalo in 1980 and Chidambara Rahasya in 1985 from the Sahitya Akademi. Modernisation and westernisation continue to inform sensibilities and spawn new literary techniques and genres.Murthy (1992), p 189 The most striking developments in recent times have been the rise of the prose form to a position of predominance ‚Äî a position earlier held by poetry ‚Äî and the prodigious growth in dramatic literature. More recently Bandaya (Rebellion) and Dalit literature, in some ways a throwback to the Pragatishila (Progressivism) days, have come to the fore. Mahadeva's Marikondavaru (\\"Those who sold themselves\\") and Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi (\\"Murder in the Eastern Region\\") are examples of this trend. Kannada writers have been presented with 8 Jnanpith awards, 63 Sahitya Akademi awards and 9 Sahitya Akademi Fellowships in India, and numerous other national and international awards since India's independence.

Life Troughton was born at Corney, Cumberland, the youngest of six children to Francis Troughton, a husbandman on a farm, and his wife, Mary Stable. Originally raised to tend animals he went to London in 1773http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Troughton.html He then served an apprenticeship with his uncle, John Troughton (b.c.1716) alongside his elder brother, also John Troughton, and in 1779 he became his business partner and soon established himself as the top maker of navigational, surveying and astronomical instruments in Britain. They were based at 136 Fleet Street in central London. Their shop was called the \\"Sign of the Orrery\\". In 1795 he delivered what is now known as the Troughton Equatorial Telescope to the Armagh Observatory, a 2-inch aperture refractor telescope mounted equatorially, and its first major instrument since its founding in 1790 (It survived into the 21st century also). He created the Groombridge Transit Circle in 1806, which Stephen Groombridge used to compile his star catalogue. He did not merely build instruments, but designed and invented new ones. Troughton was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1809. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1810 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1822. In 1826, after John's death and in failing health himself, he took on William Simms as a partner and the firm became known as Troughton & Simms. Troughton was involved in a lawsuit against Sir James South, who was dissatisfied with the quality of an equatorial mounting that Troughton made for him. Troughton sued for payment, and with informal legal counsel provided by Richard Sheepshanks, he prevailed. Troughton was color blind. He died in London on 12 June 1835http://www- groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Troughton.html and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in south London. He was unmarried and had no children.

During the 1980s he was a member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was called the \\"godfather of glasnost\\" as he is considered to be the intellectual force behind Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program of glasnost and perestroika. Yakovlev was the first Soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret protocols of the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with Nazi Germany. Early career As the first child of five, Yakovlev was born to a peasant family in a tiny village Korolevo on the Volga River near Yaroslavl. He had four sisters, two of whom died in infancy. His father Nikolai Alekseevich only attended school for four years and his mother, a nursemaid, Agafiia Mikhailovna three months. Yakovlev was sickly in childhood and suffered from scrofula. His father served in the Red Cavalry during the Civil War and was fully committed to Communist regime. He became the first chairman of local collective farm. Their house was set ablaze while he was seven and the family move to Krasnye Tkachi. Yakovlev graduated from secondary school days before Germans invaded Soviet union. He was drafted in the Red Army in November 1941, after brief training, was promoted lieutenant in a rifle platoon during World War II. He served as a platoon commander in Volkhov Front. On August 6, 1942, he was leading 30 Chuvash peasants and was ordered to charge German positions in Vinyagolovo near Leningrad. He was badly wounded, and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944. Then he regarded Communist Party as \\"life's truth\\" and affirmed he was one-hundred percent loyal and faithful to Soviet Union while he was an ardent admirer of Stalin. He was hospitalized until March 1943, during which he almost had an amputation, but was saved at last moment. In September 1945, he resumed education in to study history. On September 8, 1945, he married Nina Ivanovna Smirnova. He graduated the same year and went to Moscow to attend the Higher Party School. In November 1946, he was appointed the instructor of the Department of Propaganda and Agitation in Yaroslavl, a post he held for a year and a half. Shortly after he had his first doubt about the regime when he was shocked to see train after train carrying ex-Soviet prisoners of war sent to labor camps. At the Vspolye train station, he saw weeping women and was dismayed at how they were treated. This memory troubled him deeply and never left. He was assigned to the party's Central Committee as an instructor in the department of schools in March 1953 shortly after Stalin's death. In 1956, Khrushchev's Secret Speech stood as the most traumatic event in Yakovlev's early Moscow life. He listened to the speaker from the balcony in the Large Kremlin Palace on February 25, 1956. After the 20th Party Congress, Yakovlev lost his previous enthusiasm for Communism and led a double life. He wanted to turn to the original sources‚ÄîMarx, Engels, Lenin, German philosophers, French and Italian socialists and British economists. He asked to leave the Central Committee to enroll in the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee. Twice refused, he was allowed to study there for two years and became aware of the hollowness and impracticability of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, its inhumanity and prognostic fraud, which also healed his wounds inflicted by the 20th Party Congress. He began to agree with Khrushchev. Beginning in 1958, he was chosen as a Fulbright exchange student at Columbia University in the United States for one year.Keller, Bill. \\"Moscow's other Mastermind: Aleksandr Yakovlev\\", New York Times Magazine, February 19, 1989, pp.30-33, 40-43. . Of the seventeen Soviet students, fourteen were selected by KGB. Yakovlev and three others, all KGB personnel, including Oleg Kalugin, went to Columbia. He intensively studied English language, Roosevelt and the New Deal, drawing relevance between then US and USSR. At the end in May 1959, the Soviet visitors were taken on a thirty-day tour of the US, during which he stayed with US family from Vermont, Chicago, Iowa. Since then, he began to view perestroika as a USSR-version of New Deal to save Communism, as Roosevelt had save capitalism. However, his year in America did little to assuage his anti- Americanism because of the mammonism, racism, etc. Yakovlev returned to the Central Committee to work on ideology and propaganda, published several anti- American books. He defended a dissertation dealing with historiography of US foreign policy and received the degree of kandidat nauk, the equivalent of doctorate in July 1960. In July 1965, he was appointed the first deputy head of Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU by Brezhnev. In August 1968, Yakovlev was sent to Prague as the representative of CPSU Central Committee, witnessed the entry of tanks into Prague. He later spoke out against removing Dubcek. Also in 1968, he was placed in command of a group drafting the new constitution. Yakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the CPSU's Department of Ideology and Propaganda from 1969 to 1973. In January 1970, he visited US again and met Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, and Jane Fonda, who warned him that Moscow \\"did not appreciate the full danger of American militarism\\". The trip did not change his unfavorable impression with US. In 1972, he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled \\"Against Antihistoricism\\"–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –Ø–∫–æ–≤–ª–µ–≤ –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∑–º–∞ - –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞¬ª, 15 –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 1972 –≥ in Literaturnaya Gazeta critical of Russian nationalism and nationalism in the Soviet Union in general. As a result, he was removed from his position. Given the choice of a post as exile, he chose to be the ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. He arrived in Canada in July 1973. During this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends. Trudeau's second son, Alexandre Trudeau, was given the Russian nickname \\"Sacha\\" after Yakovlev's. From May 16 to 23, 1983, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two renewed their earlier friendship and, tentatively at first, began to discuss the prospect of liberalisation in the Soviet Union. In an interview years later, Yakovlev recalled: > At first we kind of sniffed around each other and our conversations didn't > touch on serious issues. And then, verily, history plays tricks on one, we > had a lot of time together as guests of then Liberal Minister of Agriculture > Eugene Whelan in Canada who, himself, was too late for the reception because > he was stuck with some striking farmers somewhere. So we took a long walk on > that Minister's farm and, as it often happens, both of us suddenly were just > kind of flooded and let go.

And he did the > same thing. We were completely frank. He frankly talked about the problems > in the internal situation in Russia. He was saying that under these > conditions, the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom, the > country would simply perish. So it was at that time, during our three-hour > conversation, almost as if our heads were knocked together, that we poured > it all out and during that three-hour conversation we actually came to > agreement on all our main points. Two weeks after the visit, as a result of Gorbachev's interventions, Yakovlev was recalled from Canada by Yuri Andropov and became Director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow on August 16, 1983. He was succeeded by his friend Yevgeny Primakov in 1985. Although impressed with Canada's free, competitive economy, especially in agriculture, the weakest part for USSR, and the benefits of rule of law, Yakovlev published a booklet called Poor Santa Claus, or the Police Eye of Democracy allegedly exposing Canadian totalitarian practices under the pseudonym N. Agashin. It described how capitalism created \\"its sanitary serve - a system of repression, intimidation and terror\\", how it \\"brainwashed its citizens\\", how the United States \\"tyrannized its neighbor\\" Canada was really a totalitarian police state with a democratic fa√ßade. Perestroika and its aftermath Mikhail Gorbachev and Yakovlev opposite George H. W. Bush on board the SS Maxim Gorkiy at the Malta Summit in 1989. Yakovlev as the head of the Commission on the Rehabilitation of Soviet Repression Victims meets President Vladimir Putin When Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, Yakovlev became a senior advisor, helping to shape Soviet foreign policy by advocating Soviet non-intervention in Eastern Europe, and accompanying Gorbachev on his five summit meetings with President of the United States Ronald Reagan. In the summer of 1985, Yakovlev became head of the propaganda department of the CPSU Central Committee. Domestically, he argued in favour of the reform programs that became known as glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) and played a key role in executing those policies. In 1987, the Russian nationalist organization Pamyat sent a letter entitled \\"Stop Yakovlev!\\" to the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, labelling Yakovlev as the main instigator of a course of action that would lead to the 'capitulation before the imperialists'.¬´–û—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç–µ –Ø–∫–æ–≤–ª–µ–≤–∞!¬ª –õ–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞‚Äî–æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ö–æ–æ—Ä–¥–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –î–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è ¬´–ü–∞–º—è—Ç—å¬ª –∫ –ü–ª–µ–Ω—É–º—É –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ö–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–∞ –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ü–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞ For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet Pact. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989 Yakovlev concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed his findings to the Soviet Parliament. As a result, the first multi-party elected Congress of Soviets since 1918 \\"passed the declaration admitting the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them\\".Jerzy W. Borejsza, Klaus Ziemer, Magdalena Hu≈Ças. Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes in Europe, p. 521. Berghahn Books, 2006. He was promoted to the Politburo in 1987, but by 1990 he had become the focus of attacks by hardliner communists in the party opposed to liberalisation. At the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in July 1990, a cynical Alexander Lebed caused uproar when he asked Yakovlev: \\"Alexander Nikolaevich... How many faces have you got?\\" An embarrassed Yakovlev consulted his colleagues and continued on with the proceedings, but resigned from the Politburo the day after the congress concluded.Times Wire Services. \\"Six Quitting the Politburo: Exits Laid to Lessening of Party's Role\\". 3 July 1990. As the communists opposed to liberalization gained strength, his position became more tenuous; fiercely attacked by his former prot√©g√© Gennady Zyuganov in May 1991, he resigned from the Party two days before the August Coup in 1991. During the coup, Yakovlev joined the democratic opposition against it. Following the failed coup attempt, Yakovlev blamed Gorbachev for having been na√Øve in bringing the plotters into his inner circle saying Gorbachev was \\"guilty of forming a team of traitors. Why did he surround himself with people capable of treason?\\" globeandmail.com by Vladimir Isachenkov. Retrieved 2005-10-18 In his book Inside the Stalin Archives (2008), Jonathan Brent tells that in 1991, when there were Lithuanian crowds demonstrating for independence from the Soviet Union, Gorbachev consulted Yakovlev about the wisdom of an armed repression against them. Gorbachev asked, \\"Should we shoot?\\" Yakovlev answered that, \\"if a single Soviet soldier fired a single bullet on the unarmed crowds, Soviet power would be over.\\" There were bullets and the USSR collapsed seven months later.Jonathan Brent. Inside the Stalin Archives. Discovering the New Russia. Atlas & Co., 2008 () reviewed by Martin Walker in Paper Trail The New York Times, January 23, 2009. In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yakovlev wrote and lectured extensively on history, politics and economics. He acted as the leader of the Russian Party of Social Democracy, which in the mid-1990s fused into United Democrats (a pro-reform alliance that was later reorganized into Union of Right Forces). In 2002, acting as head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, he was present at the announcement of the release of a CD detailing names and short biographies of the victims of Soviet purges. In his later life, he founded and led the International Democracy Foundation. He advocated taking responsibility for the past crimes of communism and was critical of President Vladimir Putin's restrictions on democracy.

The first was for a group of entry-level compacts including the conventional front-engine compacts built by GM divisions Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac from 1961 to 1963. The second, and current, incarnation is used for a high-end rear-wheel drive sports-car platform (chiefly that of the Chevrolet Corvette) from the 1980s through the 2000s. First Y platform (1960‚Äì1964) The original Y bodies were: * Buick Special (1961‚Äì1963) * Buick Skylark (1962‚Äì1963) * Oldsmobile F-85 (1961‚Äì1963) * Oldsmobile Cutlass (1961‚Äì1963) * Oldsmobile Jetfire (1962‚Äì1963) * Pontiac Tempest (1961‚Äì1963) * Pontiac Tempest LeMans (1961‚Äì1963) * Pontiac LeMans (1963) Initially, each of the Y-body compacts from Buick, Olds and Pontiac were only offered as four- door sedans and station wagons when introduced in the fall of 1960 as 1961 models. In mid-1961, each of three divisions introduced pillared two-door models to the line with sportier versions of the Buick and Olds models added including the Special Skylark and F-85 Cutlass, both of which featured bucket seats, custom interior and exterior trim, and more powerful engines. For 1962, convertibles were added to the lineup by each of the divisions, with Pontiac also adding the sportier Tempest LeMans coupe and convertible to its compact lineup. This all-new platform replaced vehicles GM was importing from Europe, selling the Vauxhall Victor that was made in England. The rear-engined 1960-69 Chevrolet Corvair Z-body up to 1964 used a variation of the rear swing-axle suspension and a transaxle similar to that found on the 1961-63 Pontiac Tempest. The 1961-62 Corvair station wagons even shared the same roofline as the 1961-63 Y-body wagons. Chevrolet's front-engine compact, introduced as the Chevy II for 1962 had some dimensions similar to the Y-body cars, but had a two-inch shorter wheelbase and was also shorter in length and width, its own X-body platform which featured uni-body construction, single-leaf rear suspension and conventional in-line four- and six-cylinder engines. =First Y platform innovations= The Y-body family of cars contained more innovative features than all other American products of that decade. Each model contained at least one notable advance: * Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 for all three years shared an aluminum block 215 cubic-inch V8 engine featuring cast- iron liners to prevent overheating and block warpage problems common with aluminum block engines. Although Buick and Olds shared the same basic engine design, both divisions used different cylinder heads, camshafts, carburetors and compression ratios. The 215 V8 was also available on the Pontiac Tempest for 1961 and 1962 and used the Buick version, but very few Tempests were so- equipped. * For 1962, Buick introduced a new 198 cubic-inch V6 engine for the lower-line Special models in order to allow for a lower base price. That V6 shared many parts and dimensions with the aluminum V8 engine but featured a cast iron block. * Oldsmobile introduced a turbocharged version of the 215 V8 in mid-1962 for a special performance version of the F-85/Cutlass called the Jetfire. This engine was among the first production turbocharged engines ever offered in a passenger car, the other being the Chevrolet Corvair's turbocharged flat-six engine introduced simultaneously for the Monza Spyder. The Olds Jetfire turbocharged V8 featured a four-barrel, 10.25 to 1 compression and was rated at 215 horsepower - one horsepower per cubic inch. * The Pontiac Tempest came standard with a 195 cubic-inch slant four-cylinder engine - then the only U.S.-built passenger car with such an engine. The Tempest four was really created from half a 389 cubic inch V8 block used in the standard Pontiacs. This engine, available with one- and four-barrel carburetion offered horsepower ratings ranging from 110 to 166. * The Tempest also used a rear transmission, or transaxle to permit four wheel independent suspension, a flat floor, eliminating the driveshaft hump, for improved interior space, while the Buick Special and Olds F-85 used a conventional front engine/front transmission drivetrain, albeit, with a two piece driveshaft. * The Tempest also used an independent rear swing axle suspension similar to the rear-engine Chevy Corvair while the Buick and Olds compacts featured a conventional rear coil spring suspension. * For 1963, Pontiac replaced the Buick-sourced 215 aluminum V8 with a Pontiac built 326 cubic-inch V8 as the top power option for the Tempest. No one seems to know why the 326 of 1963 was called a 326, because the true displacement was 336. This 326 was based on the big Pontiac's 389 V8 and shared many of the larger engine's dimensions and components with horsepower ratings of 260 and 280. The '63 326 Tempest/LeMans served as a testbed for the 389-powered 1964 GTO that would be based on a larger and more conventionally engineered Tempest introduced the following year. Motor Trend magazine named the Corvair as its 1960 Car of the Year, Tempest as 1961's Car of the Year, and the V6 Special received the award in 1962. =End of the first Y platform= Each of the Buick, Olds and Pontiac Y-body senior compacts were replaced by a larger intermediate-sized platform called the A-Body for the 1964 model year, which was shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle. With the switch from a senior compact to an intermediate-sized platform, most of these \\"innovative\\" features were discontinued such as the Tempest's four-cylinder engine and transaxle, the aluminum block V8 (whose tooling was sold to Rover of England who improved the design enjoying considerable success with it as the Rover V8 in models such as the Rover P5B and Range Rover) and the Olds Jetfire's turbocharged version of that V8. Also, the unit-body construction used in the Y-body cars was replaced by conventional body-on-frame construction for the A-body. The Buick V6 was continued and enlarged to 225 cubic inches with the basic engine remaining in production for many years, with a 3.8-liter or 231 cubic-inch displacement. The aluminum V8 was replaced by conventional cast-iron block V8s of 300 cubic inches for the Buick Special/Skylark and 330 inches for the Oldsmobile F-85/Cutlass, while Pontiac carried over its 326 cubic-inch V8 to the '64 Tempest/LeMans line while switching the base engine from the four-cylinder to a 215 cubic-inch inline six-cylinder. Second Y platform (1984‚Äì2019) Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06 Y bodies built after 1964 can be identified by the inclusion of the Y as the fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN. Only two Y-body cars have been produced in this second group: * 2004‚Äì2009 Cadillac XLR * 1984‚Äì2019 Chevrolet Corvette The Y-Body has a rear- wheel drive, front-engined V8 layout, accommodating either a small block Chevrolet V8 (such as an LT4 or LS1) in the Corvette, or the 32-valve DOHC Northstar V8 in the XLR. The Y-Body also has 4-wheel independent suspension. Like a standard rear-wheel drive, front-engined chassis, the Y-Body's V8 engine is longitudinally mounted, but unlike many such cars, the Y-Body incorporates a rear-mounted transmission (1997-present) instead of a transmission mounted directly to the engine. Power is transferred to the transmission via a torque tube. The transmission is offered in both 4/5/6/8-speed automatic versions and 6 and 7-speed manual versions. As of 2015 the Y platform is considered as the sole perimeter frame automobile in production (the perimeter frame has an integrated endoskeleton which serves as a safety cage). GM's Kappa platform was inspired by the Y-body. The distinctive feature of both platforms is the backbone central-tunnel design.

Early life He was born in Birmingham, the second of nine children of William Simms (1763-1828), a toy maker. Soon after William Simm's birth the family moved to London so that William Simms Sr. could help his ailing father, James Simms, who had a jewellery business in Whitecross Street. This business was soon converted to the manufacture of optical instruments. William Sr. prospered and in 1804 he was elected a Freeman of the City. William Simms Jr. was sent in January 1806 to be educated in mathematics by a Mr. Hayward. After two years education in January 1808 he was apprenticed to Thomas Penstone, a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. However William's interests lay elsewhere and in 1808 he was apprenticed to his father. Career He was elected a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1815 and set up in business for himself, working until 1818 at his father's Blackfriars premises. His elder brother James was already establishing his own reputation for navigational instruments. William Simms' chief interest was the division of the circle, the accuracy of which was essential to the manufacture of accurate scientific instruments. He became a correspondent of Thomas Jones, who brought him into contact with the instrument maker Edward Troughton and also persuaded him to join the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce. Here he met the engineer Bryan Donkin, and also Colonel Colby of the Ordnance Survey. In the 1825 Simms was asked to repair and redivide an astronomical circle made by Troughton in 1800.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 24-25 Simms made and replaced parts where required, then redivided the circle. Later Simms wrote a paper for Troughton proposing a new method for dividing circles that was more accurate than an engine and quicker than using a roller.SDUK, The Penny Cyclopedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge Vol 11 P 330 Edward Troughton took on William Simms as a partner in 1826 Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 6-24 On Troughton's retirement Simms took over his business, which had a very good reputation in the manufacture of scientific instruments. Simms specialized in surveying instruments and from 1817 supplied theodolites to the Ordnance Survey and then to the East India Company, including those used by George Everest. On a larger scale he supplied telescopes, mural circles and other astronomical instruments to observatories at Krak√≥w, Madras, Cambridge, Lucknow, Calcutta, Edinburgh, Brussels, Greenwich and other places. By the close of his career he had supplied most of the world's leading observatories with equipment. Simms' work formed the basis of the treatise on mathematical instruments written by his younger brother Frederick Walter Simms, who went on to become an important writer on civil engineering. His reputation was enhanced by the improvements he made to graduating instruments and his self-acting circular dividing engine reduced the work involved in manufacture from weeks to hours. He also helped standardize the measures of length the yard and chain for the Admiralty. Simms was elected an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1828. He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, which he joined in 1831, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852. Simms died at the family home in Carshalton on 21 June 1860 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His family, most especially his son James Simms carried on his instrument making work.

It stood from 1890 until it was torn down starting in 1961 as part of major urban renewal efforts in the city that saw about 40% of the downtown district razed and replaced with new structures. At the time, the pending destruction of the Richardsonian Romanesque building provided a catalyst for historic preservation movements in the city and across the state.Lost Twin Cities by Larry Millett, (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1992) pp. 222‚Äì225. Early skyscraper The building is considered the city's first skyscraper, with 12 stories and standing tall. Small observation towers poked up above the corners, and the rooftop had a popular garden. It was built of green New Hampshire granite and red Lake Superior sandstone, with the interiors dressed in antique oak and beautiful ornamental iron and brass work by Crown Iron Works Company of Minneapolis. A large skylight allowed the interior to be safely lit in a time when electric lighting was rare (though the building was eventually wired), and the floors of walkways circling the center court were translucent to allow more light to filter through. Architect E. Townsend Mix designed the building, and it is considered to be his most notable achievement. Many of the city's most prestigious companies had offices in the Metropolitan.The men behind the Metropolitan Building www.startribune.com. Retrieved: March 5, 2013. When it went up, the building was owned by the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company. Louis F. Menage, founder, had gained a fortune while speculating on real estate in the Minneapolis area in the 1880s. He spent $1 million on the project. Many hailed the building when it was first completed, although some such as Cass Gilbert did not like the style. Downfall The Panic of 1893 caused Menage's company to collapse, and he fled the country. Thomas Lowry, another major real estate speculator and the owner of the area's streetcar network, purchased the building but only held onto it for a little more than a decade before selling it to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1905.

The chi is also the same character as katana (ÂàÄ) and the t≈ç in nihont≈ç (Êó•Êú¨ÂàÄ \\"Japanese sword\\"), originally from the Chinese character for a blade, dƒÅo. To qualify as an ≈çdachi, the sword in question would have a blade length of around 3 shaku (). However, as with most terms in Japanese sword arts, there is no exact definition of the size of an ≈çdachi.  History  In the Nanboku-ch≈ç period in the 14 century, huge Japanese swords such as ≈çdachi became popular. The reason for this is thought to be that the conditions for making a practical large-sized sword were established due to the nationwide spread of strong and sharp swords of the S≈çsh≈´ school. In the case of ≈çdachi whose blade was 150 cm long, it was impossible to draw a sword from the scabbard on the waist, so people carried it on their back or had their servants carry it. Large naginata and kanab≈ç were also popular in this period.Êó•Êú¨ÂàÄ„ÅÆÊ≠¥Âè≤ ÂçóÂåóÊúùÊôÇ‰ª£ Touken world However, as infantry were equipped with yari and naginata, this fashion died out in a short period of time. Furthermore, from the Sengoku period in the latter part of the Muromachi period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, as tactics shifted to fighting with yaris and guns by a large group of infantry, ≈çdachi became even more obsolete. As ≈çdachi became useless, it was often cut and replaced with a tachi and katana.[Kazuo Tokunou Êó•Êú¨ÂàÄÂõ≥Èëë ‰øùÂ≠òÁâà] ≈ådachi was used as a weapon, but because of its magnificent appearance, it was often used as an offering to kami, a Shinto shrine. For example, ≈åyamazumi Shrine, which is said to be a treasure house of Japanese swords and armor, is dedicated to the national treasure ≈ådachi, which was dedicated by Emperor Go-Murakami, and ≈çdachi, which was dedicated by ≈åmori Naoharu and killed Kusunoki Masashige.Â§ßÂ±±Á•áÁ•ûÁ§æÔºàÊÑõÂ™õÁúå‰ªäÊ≤ªÂ∏ÇÔºâ Touken world In the peaceful Edo period, ≈çdachi was no longer regarded as a practical weapon and came to be recognized only as an offering to the kami of Shinto shrines. Production A sheathed ≈çdachi ≈ådachi are difficult to produce because their length makes traditional heat treatment more complicated: The longer a blade is, the more difficult (and expensive) it is to heat the whole blade to a homogeneous temperature, both for annealing and to reach the hardening temperature. The quenching process then needs a bigger quenching medium because uneven quenching might lead to warping the blade. The method of polishing is also different. Because of their size, ≈çdachi are usually hung from the ceiling or placed in a stationary position to be polished, unlike normal swords which are moved over polishing stones. In the past, acquiring a fully sharpened ≈çdachi was difficult, as they required special custom orders. In modern times though, many forges in Japan and China are accepting such orders due to the renewed popularity and interest in ancient Japanese weaponry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Method of use Samurai with an ≈çdachi on a horse 291x291px As battlefield weapons, ≈çdachi were too long for samurai to carry on their waists like normal swords. There were two main methods in which they could be carried. One was to carry it on one's back; however, this was seen as impractical as it was impossible for the wielder to draw it quickly. The other method was simply to carry the sheathed ≈çdachi by hand. The trend during the Muromachi era was for the samurai carrying the ≈çdachi to have a follower to help draw it. An exception does exist, though. The K≈çden Enshin-ry≈´ taught by Fumon Tanaka use a special drawing technique for \\"short\\" ≈çdachi allowing it to be carried on the waist. The technique is to pull out the sheath rather than drawing the blade. While this move is also used in other schools, for example, Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´, Shin mus≈ç Hayashizaki-ry≈´ and Iaid≈ç, only Enshin-ry≈´ seems to have used it to improve the drawing speed of an ≈çdachi, the other schools having used it with classical katana. The Kage-ry≈´ style is also used to draw from the belt, using blades of approximately 2.8 shaku. ≈ådachi swordplay styles differed from that of other Japanese swords, focusing on downward cuts. One possible use of ≈çdachi is as large anti-cavalry weapons, to strike down the horse as it approaches. Alternatively, it could be used as a cavalry-on-cavalry weapon comparable to the Chinese zhanmadao, with the long reach, increased weight and slashing area of the blade offering some advantages over spears, lances and smaller swords.

The prophecy is recorded by Ezekiel as having been received on Yom Kippur of the year 3372 of the Hebrew calendar.Rashi, Vilna Gaon and Malbim to Ezekiel Chap. 40 In the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, the city is also called the Heavenly Jerusalem, as well as being called Zion in other books of the Christian Bible. Judaism and origin In Jewish mysticism, there are two Gardens of Eden and two Promised Lands: the heavenly invisible one and the earthly visible one that is a copy of the heavenly invisible one.Jewish Encyclopedia: ParadiseJewish Encyclopedia: Garden of Eden Heaven in Jewish mysticism includes a heavenly Promised land - including Jerusalem, the temple, and the ark of the covenant -Jewish Encyclopedia: Paradise and a heavenly Garden of Eden - including the tree of life, a storehouse for the manna that angels eat, and multiple rivers that water the garden.Jewish Encyclopedia: ParadiseJewish Encyclopedia: Garden of Eden When the Bible mentions a New Jerusalem, heavenly sanctuary, bread of life, or God's throne, it is referring to the Jewish mystical understanding of heaven.Jewish Encyclopedia: ParadiseJewish Encyclopedia: Garden of Eden The Babylonian threat to the Kingdom of Judah began as the Babylonian Empire conquered Assyria and rose to power from 612-609 BCE. Jerusalem surrendered without major bloodshed to Babylon in 597. An Israelite uprising brought the destruction of Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs army upon Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The entire city, including the First Temple, was burned. Israelite aristocrats were taken captive to Babylon. The Book of Ezekiel contains the first record of the New Jerusalem. Within , there is an extended and detailed description of the measurements of the Temple, its chambers, porticos, and walls. contains a list of twelve Temple gates named for Israel‚Äôs tribes. The Book of Zechariah expands upon Ezekiel‚Äôs New Jerusalem. After the Second Temple was built after the exile, Jerusalem‚Äôs population was only a few hundred. There were no defensive city walls until 445 BCE.(The rebuilding of the walls under Nehemiah is covered in the Book of Nehemiah) In the passage, the author writes about a city wall of fire to protect the enormous population. This text demonstrates the beginning of a progression of New Jerusalem thought. In Ezekiel, the focus is primarily on the human act of Temple construction. In Zechariah, the focus shifts to God‚Äôs intercession in the founding of New Jerusalem. New Jerusalem is further extrapolated in Isaiah, where New Jerusalem is adorned with precious sapphires, jewels, and rubies. The city is described as a place free from terror and full of righteousness. Here, Isaiah provides an example of Jewish apocalypticism, where a hope for a perfected Jerusalem and freedom from oppression is revealed. As the original New Jerusalem composition, Ezekiel functioned as a source for later works such as 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, Qumran documents, and the Book of Revelation. These texts used similar measurement language and expanded on the limited eschatological perspective in Ezekiel. = Interpretation = Judaism sees the Messiah as a human male descendant of King David who will be anointed as the king of Israel and sit on the throne of David in Jerusalem. He will gather in the lost tribes of Israel, clarify unresolved issues of halakha, and rebuild the Holy Temple in Jerusalem according to the pattern shown to the prophet Ezekiel. During this time Jews believe an era of global peace and prosperity will be initiated, the nations will love Israel and will abandon their gods, turn toward Jerusalem, and come to the Holy Temple to worship the one God of Israel. Zechariah prophesied that any family among the nations who does not appear in the Temple in Jerusalem for the festival of Sukkoth will have no rain that year. Isaiah prophesied that the rebuilt Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations. The city of YHWH Shamma, the new Jerusalem, will be the gathering point of the world's nations, and will serve as the capital of the renewed Kingdom of Israel. Ezekiel prophesied that this city will have 12 gates, one gate for each of the tribes of Israel. The book of Isaiah closes with the prophecy, \\"And it will come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before Me, says YHWH\\". = Antiochene Persecutions, Hasmonean High Priesthood = The Animal Apocalypse within 1 Enoch (chapters 85-90), is another example where conflict sparks hopes for the New Jerusalem. First Enoch is an apocalyptic response to the persecutions under Seleucid Emperor Antiochus IV. In 167 BCE, Emperor Antiochus returned from fighting in Egypt to quell a revolt in Jerusalem led by Jason, the former High Priest. An agitated Antiochus imposed harsh restrictions on Jewish religion. Circumcision, feast celebration, Sabbath observance were all banned. Antiochus ordered the burning of Torah copies. Jews were required to eat pork. The worst oppression came in the desecration of the Temple. A polytheistic cult was formed, and worship of YHWH abolished. A statue to a Seleucid deity was constructed on the Jewish altar. First Enoch was written in the wake of this calamity between 166 BCE-163 BCE. For the author of 1 Enoch, history is a steep descent into evil from the utopia in Eden. The author‚Äôs vision of the eschaton centers on the restoration of Jerusalem: \\"I saw until the owner of the sheep brought a house, new and larger and loftier than the former\\" (1 Enoch 90:29). In this New Jerusalem passage, the sheep are the Jewish people, the builder is God, and the house is the Temple. During the same time period, the Dead Sea scrolls contain a New Jerusalem tradition formed out of strife. As a tiny Jewish sect living in the caves of Qumran, the Essenes opposed Temple leadership and the High Priesthood in Jerusalem. Their condemnation of the Temple focused on criticizing High Priests. They were also frustrated that Judean Kings were also given the role of High Priest. The Essenes were not against the institution of the Temple and its cult per se. The Essenes at Qumran predicted the reunified twelve tribes to rise together against Roman occupation and incompetent Temple leadership and re-establish true Temple worship. The surviving New Jerusalem texts in Qumran literature focus specifically on the twelve city gates, and on the dimensions of the entire new city. In 4Q554, the gates of Simeon, Joseph, and Reuben are mentioned in this partial fragment. For the author of this fragment, the New Jerusalem‚Äôs twelve gates signify the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel. In 5Q15, the author accompanies an angel who measures the blocks, houses, gates, avenues, streets, dining halls, and stairs of the New Jerusalem. There are two important points to consider regarding the Qumran Essenes. First, we do not have enough scroll fragments to completely analyze their New Jerusalem ideologies. Second, based on the evidence available, the Essenes rebelled against Temple leadership, not the Temple itself. Their vision of the New Jerusalem looked for the reunification of the twelve tribes around an eschatological Temple. = 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch = As evidenced above, the historical progression of New Jerusalem language is specifically tied to conflict. The Babylonian Exile, Antiochene persecutions, and corrupt leadership in Jerusalem incited apocalyptic responses with a vision for a New Jerusalem. In the 1st century CE, an even greater conflict exploded in Iudaea province; the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, as well as the other Roman-Jewish Wars. Subsequent apocalyptic responses fundamentally altered the New Jerusalem eschatology for Jews and Early Christians. At the core, apocalypses are a form of theodicy. They respond to overwhelming suffering with the hope of divine intercession and a perfected World to Come. The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 meant an end to Second Temple Judaism. Naturally, apocalyptic responses to the disaster followed. This section will first cover 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch. Fourth Ezra and 2 Baruch are important for two reasons. First, they look for a Temple in Heaven, not the eschaton. Second, these texts exhibit the final new Temple texts in Judaism. Jewish texts like 3 Baruch began to reject a restored Temple completely. However, these texts were deemed to be apocryphal by the Rabbis who maintained the belief in a Third Temple as central to Rabbinic Judaism. The Jewish apocalypse of 4 Ezra is a text contained in the apocryphal book 2 Esdras. The genre of 4 Ezra is historical fiction, set thirteen years after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra is dated approximately in 83 CE, thirteen years after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. The story follows Ezra‚Äôs period of mourning following Jerusalem‚Äôs fall. Ezra is Job-like in his criticism of God‚Äôs allowance of Jerusalem‚Äôs downfall. In Ezra‚Äôs deep state of grief, he meets a woman lamenting over Jerusalem. Ezra consoles the woman, and tells her to, \\"shake off your great sadness, and lay aside your many sorrows‚Ä¶ the Most High may give you rest.\\" (4 Ezra 10:24). Suddenly, the woman is transfigured in an array of bright lights. She transforms into the New Jerusalem being rebuilt. As a bereaved widow she convinced Ezra to apply solace to himself through the image of a New Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra has two clear messages. First, do not grieve excessively over Jerusalem. Second, Jerusalem will be restored as a heavenly kingdom. Fourth Ezra also uses the title \\"Most High,\\" throughout the apocalypse to emphasis that the Lord will once again reign and reside in Jerusalem. The apocalypse of 2 Baruch is a contemporary narrative of 4 Ezra. The text also follows the same basic structure 4 Ezra: Job-like grief, animosity towards the Lord, and the rectification of Jerusalem that leads to the comfort of the Job-figure. Second Baruch is historical fiction, written after the Roman destruction but set before the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. Baruch is distressed when the Lord informs him of Jerusalem‚Äôs impending doom. Baruch responds with several theological questions for God. For this study, Baruch‚Äôs inquiry about the future of Israel and the honor of the Lord are most pertinent (2 Baruch 3:4-6). Baruch learns that the Lord will destroy the city, not the enemy. Baruch also learns of a pre-immanent heavenly Temple: \\"[The Temple] was already prepared from the moment I decided to create paradise.\\" And I showed it to Adam before he sinned.\\" (2 Baruch 4:3). This Temple was created before Adam, and shown to him before Adam‚Äôs fall. Two important conclusions come from 2 Baruch. First, the author dismisses hopes for an earthly re-built Temple. The focus is entirely on the heavenly Temple that pre-dated the Garden of Eden. This may be a device to express the supremacy of the heavenly Temple as a sanctuary built before Eden (the traditional location of the earthly Temple). Second, Baruch believes that restoration for the people of Israel exists in heaven, not on earth. The apocalypse of 3 Baruch is the anomaly among post-revolt New Jerusalem texts. Unlike 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, the text exemplifies an alternative tradition that lacks a restored Temple. Like other apocalypses, 3 Baruch still mourns over the Temple, and re-focuses Jews to the heavens. Yet 3 Baruch finds that the Temple is ultimately unnecessary. This move could be polemical against works which afforded the Temple with excessive veneration. In the passage, an angel comes to Baruch and consoles him over Jerusalem: \\"Where is their God? And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem.\\" (3 Baruch 1:3) Third Baruch certainly mourns over the Temple. Yet 3 Baruch is not ultimately concerned with the lack of a Temple. This text goes along with Jeremiah and Sibylline Oracles 4 to express a minority tradition within Jewish literature. In the first Christian apocalypse, the Book of Revelation coincides with this perspective on Jerusalem. The study will now move to early Christian perspectives on the Temple and the apocalyptic response in Revelation.E.P.

Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993), 61-79Geza Vermes, The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (4th ed. New York: Penguin Books, 1997), 568-570 Christianity Christians have always placed religious significance on Jerusalem as the site of the crucifixion of Jesus and other events central to the Christian faith. In particular, the destruction of the Second Temple that took place in the year 70, a few decades after Christianity began its split from Judaism, was seminal to the nascent Christian apocalypticism of that time. In the Olivet discourse of the Gospels, Jesus predicts the destruction of Herod's Temple, and promises that it will precede the return of the Son of Man, commonly called the Second Coming. This prophecy of the renewal of Jerusalem by the messiah echoes those of the Jewish prophets. John of Patmos' vision of the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation draws on the Olivet discourse and all the historical precursors mentioned above. Based on the Book of Revelation, premillennialism holds that, following the end times and the second creation of heaven and earth (see The New Earth), the New Jerusalem will be the earthly location where all true believers will spend eternity with God. The New Jerusalem is not limited to eschatology, however. Many Christians view the New Jerusalem as a current reality, that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the Body of Christ, the Church and that Christians already take part in membership of both the heavenly Jerusalem and the earthly Church in a kind of dual citizenship. In this way, the New Jerusalem represents to Christians the final and everlasting reconciliation of God and his chosen people, \\"the end of the Christian pilgrimage.\\" As such, the New Jerusalem is a conception of Heaven, see also Heaven (Christianity). = Interpretation = Christianity interprets the city as a physical and/or spiritual restoration or divine recreation of the city of Jerusalem. It is also interpreted by many Christian groups as referring to the Church to be the dwelling place of the saints. John of Patmos describes the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible, and so the New Jerusalem holds an important place in Christian eschatology and Christian mysticism, and has also influenced Christian philosophy and Christian theology. Such a renewal of Jerusalem, if a reconstruction, is an important theme in Judaism, Christianity, and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Renewed Jerusalem bears as its motto the words Ad librum (Latin: \\"as by the book\\".) Many traditions based on biblical scripture and other writings in the Jewish and Christian religions, such as Protestantism, and Orthodox Judaism, expect the literal renewal of Jerusalem to some day take place at the Temple Mount in accordance with various prophecies. Dispensationalists believe in a literal New Jerusalem that will come down out of Heaven, which will be an entirely new city of incredible dimensions. Other sects, such as various Protestant denominations, modernist branches of Christianity, Mormonism and Reform Judaism, view the New Jerusalem as figurative, or believe that such a renewal may have already taken place, or that it will take place at some other location besides the Temple Mount. It is important to distinguish between \\"the camp of the saints, and the beloved city\\" spoken of in Revelation 20:9, and the New Jerusalem of chapter 21. Rev. 20:9 refers to an earthly City, description and purpose of which is found in book of Ezekiel, starting with chapter 36 and ending with chapter 48. One of the most obvious differences is, the dimensions of the New Jerusalem of Rev. 21 are 1000 times bigger than dimensions of the city in Ezekiel 48 (and in Rev. 20:9) New Jerusalem of Revelation 21 is 2225 km. in length, width, and height, a city of these gigantic proportions can not be located on this earth, but as stated in ch. 21 comes down from heaven on to the new earth. =The Book of Revelation= Folio 55r of the Bamberg Apocalypse depicts the angel showing John the New Jerusalem, with the Lamb of God at its center. Introduction to the City The term New Jerusalem occurs twice in the New Testament, in verses Revelation 3:12 and Revelation 21:2 of the Book of Revelation. A large portion of the final two chapters of Revelation deals with John of Patmos' vision of the New Jerusalem. He describes the New Jerusalem as \\"'the bride, the wife of the Lamb'\\", where the river of the Water of Life flows (Revelation 22:1). After John witnesses the new heaven and a new earth \\"that no longer has any sea\\", an angel takes him \\"in the Spirit\\" to a vantage point on \\"a great and high mountain\\" to see New Jerusalem's descendants. The enormous city comes out of heaven down to the New Earth. John's elaborate description of the New Jerusalem retains many features of the Garden of Eden and the paradise garden, such as rivers, a square shape, a wall, and the Tree of Life. Description of the City According to John, the New Jerusalem is \\"pure gold, like clear glass\\" and its \\"brilliance [is] like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.\\" The street of the city is also made of \\"pure gold, like transparent glass\\". The base of the city is laid out in a square and surrounded by a wall made of jasper. It says in that the height, length, and width are of equal dimensions ‚Äì as it was with the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and First Temple ‚Äì and they measure 12,000 furlongs (which is approximately 1500.3 miles, or 1 furlong = approx 220 yards). John writes that the wall is 144 cubits, which is assumed to be the thickness since the length is mentioned previously. 144 cubits are about equal to 65 meters, or 72 yards. It is important to note that 12 is the square root of 144. The number 12 was very important to early Jews and Christians, and represented the 12 tribes of Israel and 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ. The number symbolizes completeness in Revelation.Craig R. Koester, Revelation, AB 38A. (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 2014), 417; James. L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2009), 32. The four sides of the New City represent the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West.) In this way, New Jerusalem is thought of as an inclusive place, with the 12 gates accepting all of the 12 tribes of Israel from all corners of the earth. There is no temple building in the New Jerusalem. God and the Lamb are the city's temple, since they are worshiped everywhere. Revelation 22 goes on to describe a river of the water of life that flows down the middle of the great street of the city from the Throne of God. The tree of life grows in the middle of the street and to both sides of the river. The tree bears twelve (kinds of) fruit and yields its fruit every month. According to John, \\"The leaves of the tree were for healing (those of all) nations.\\" This inclusion of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem harkens back to the Garden of Eden. The fruit the tree bears may be the fruit of life. John states that the New Jerusalem will be free of sin. The servants of God will have theosis (i.e. the power or likeness of God, that is \\"in his image\\" of holiness) and \\"His name will be on their foreheads.\\" Night will no longer fall, and the inhabitants of the city will \\"have need (of) no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light.\\" John ends his account of the New Jerusalem by stressing its eternal nature: \\"And they shall reign forever and ever.\\" =Gates= There are twelve (12) gates hanging from the wall of the New City of Jerusalem. These 12 gates are oriented in groups of three and face the four cardinal directions of the compass needle: the north, south, east and west. There is an angel at each gate, residing in a gatehouse. The 12 gates are each made of a 'single' pearl, giving these the name \\"pearly gates\\". The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are written on the 12 gates. The New Jerusalem gates may bear some relation to the gates mentioned in Enoch, Chapters 33‚Äì35, where the prophet, Enoch reports that from each of the four \\"heavenly gates ‚Äì opening in heaven ‚Äì three (new gates) were seen distinctly separating (off, as if) the extremities of the whole earth\\" [were pulling apart each of the four gates into three new ones]. Thus, the four gates were each replaced by three new ones, totaling twelve [i.e. 3 x 4 = 12] gates in all. [33, 3.][ref. Laurence translation, Book of Enoch.] =Geometry= The angel measures the New Jerusalem with the rod or reed. Note the Lamb of God and the twelve sets of figures, gates, and stones. In 21:16, the angel measures the city with a golden rod or reed, and records it as 12,000 stadia by 12,000 stadia at the base, and 12,000 stadia high. A stadion is usually stated as 185 meters, or 607 feet, so the base has dimensions of about 2220 km by 2220 km, or 1380 miles by 1380 miles. In the ancient Greek system of measurement, the base of the New Jerusalem would have been equal to 144 million square stadia, 4.9 million square kilometers or 1.9 million square miles (roughly midway between the sizes of Australia and India). If rested on the Earth, its ceiling would be inside the upper boundary of the exosphere but outside the lower boundary.Exosphere#Earth.27s exosphere By way of comparison, the International Space Station maintains an orbit with an altitude of about 386 km (240 mi) above the earth.http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/566862main_iss_fact_sheet.pdf Revelation 21:22 The Book of Revelation was composed during the end of the 1st century AD near the end of Domitian‚Äôs reign (A.D. 96), or some date it earlier during the later end of the reign of Emperor Nero Domitius (54 to 68 CE). The work is addressed to the \\"seven churches that are in Asia\\" (1:4). Revelation is normally broken into three sections: the prologue (1:1-3:22), the visions (4:1-22:5), and the epilogue (22:6-20). This study is principally concerned with chapter 21. The author of Revelation was both a Jew by birth and a believing Christian. For the author and the addressees of Revelation, they are searching for the Lord to vindicate them and judge the \\"inhabitants of the earth,\\" for their suffering (6:10). The fall of Jerusalem coupled with the Neronian persecutions form the tension within the subtext of Revelation. Throughout Revelation, several references to the Temple are made . This Temple appears to be of heavenly origin. When the eschaton arrives in , the reader expects the temple to come down from heaven with the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 even contains typical New Jerusalem terminology that accompanies a restored Temple. Specific measurements are given for the new city (Ezekiel 40-48, 4Q554), and the city is built with gold, sapphires, and emeralds (Isaiah, Tobit). In addition, 21:21 references the \\"twelve gates.\\" Revelation maintains another typical aspect of New Jerusalem tradition ‚Äì the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 48:33-34, 4Q554). Verse 22 marks a sudden and remarkable shift in New Jerusalem apocalyptic rhetoric: \\"I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.\\" Following with the tradition of 3 Baruch and 4 Sibylline Oracles, Revelation foresees an eschaton without the Temple. Why has the Revelation suddenly denied an eschatological Temple? Verse 23 sheds light on this disparity. Verse 23 proclaims, \\"And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is the light, and its lamp is the lamb.\\" For the author of Revelation, there is no need for a Temple because the Lord will be the New Jerusalem‚Äôs eternal light and Jesus (the lamb) will be its lamp. This re- interpretation utilizes Isaiah to make its case: \\"The LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun shall no more go down, or your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.\\" (Isaiah 60:19) The Temple is discarded in the eschaton because the Lord will provide illumination for the New Jerusalem, and Christ will be the glory for its residents. Henceforth, Christians believed that the New Jerusalem no longer required a Temple. For Christians, their Lord sufficiently replaced the Temple. = New Jerusalem ‚Äì Dead Sea Scrolls = Discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls near Qumran, Israel, were fragments of a scroll which describes New Jerusalem in minute detail. The New Jerusalem Scroll (as it is called) appears to contain apocalyptic vision, although, being fragmented, it is hard to categorize. Written in Aramaic, the text describes a vast city, rectangular in shape, with twelve gates and encircled by a long wall. Similar descriptions appear in Ezekiel 40-48 and Revelation 21-22 and comparison to the Temple Scroll (also found near Qumran) shows many similarities despite no direct literary links between the two. = Montanism = From the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, the ancient Christian sect of Montanism, which spread all over the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at the neighboring Phrygian towns of Pepuza and Tymion. In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Pepuza was the headquarters of the Montanist church. The Montanist patriarch resided at Pepuza. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism, serving as priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct. Since 2001, Peter Lampe of the University of Heidelberg has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepuza and Tymion, the sites of the expected descent of the New Jerusalem. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century. The ancient settlement discovered and identified as Pepuza by William Tabbernee and Peter Lampe was settled continuously from Hellenistic times to Byzantine times. In Byzantine times, an important rock-cut monastery belonged to the town. The town is in the Phrygian Karahallƒ± area, near the village of Karayakuplu (U≈üak Province, Aegean Region, Turkey). The ancient site of Tymion identified by Peter Lampe is located not far away at the Turkish village of ≈û√ºkranje. For the Montanists, the high plane between Pepuza and Tymion was an ideal landing place for the heavenly New Jerusalem. =Catholicism= The New Jerusalem, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, 1860 The Catholic Church places the New Jerusalem in the eschatological role found in Revelation. Catholicism also holds that the New Jerusalem already exists as a spiritual community in Heaven, the Church triumphant, with an outpost on earth, the Church militant. Together, the Church triumphant, Church militant, and Church suffering form the Church universal. Augustine of Hippo, a Doctor of the Church and Church Father, draws inspiration from John's account of the New Jerusalem to outline this view in his monumental work The City of God. The Catholic Encyclopedia article on \\"Heaven\\" states that Catholic > theologians deem more appropriate that there should be a special and > glorious abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where they > usually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world. For the > surroundings in the midst of which the blessed have their dwelling must be > in accordance with their happy state; and the internal union of charity > which joins them in affection must find its outward expression in community > of habitation. At the end of the world, the earth together with the > celestial bodies will be gloriously transformed into a part of the dwelling- > place of the blessed (Revelation 21). Hence there seems to be no sufficient > reason for attributing a metaphorical sense to those numerous utterances of > the Bible which suggest a definite dwelling-place of the blessed. > Theologians, therefore, generally hold that the heaven of the blessed is a > special place with definite limits. Naturally, this place is held to exist, > not within the earth, but, in accordance with the expressions of Scripture, > without and beyond its limits. All further details regarding its locality > are quite uncertain. The Church has decided nothing on this subject. =Eastern Christianity= Emperor Lalibela of Ethiopia built the city of Lalibela as a new reconstructed Jerusalem in response to the Muslim capture of Jerusalem by Saladin's forces in 1187. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the New Jerusalem is the City of God that will come down from heaven in the manner described in the Book of the Apocalypse (Revelation). The Church is an icon of the heavenly Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem Monastery in Russia takes its name from the heavenly Jerusalem. =Puritans= The New Jerusalem was an important theme in the Puritan colonization of New England in the 17th century. The Puritans were inspired by the passages in Revelation about the New Jerusalem, which they interpreted as being a symbol for the New World. The Puritans saw themselves as the builders of the New Jerusalem on earth. This idea was foundational to American nationalism.An article about the Puritans and the New Jerusalem, from PBS. =Swedenborgian= Ecclesiastic Swedenborgians often refer to their organizations as part of or contributing to the New Jerusalem as explained by Emanuel Swedenborg in such books as New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, Apocalypse Revealed, and Apocalypse Explained. According to Swedenborg, the New Jerusalem described in the Bible is a symbol for a new dispensation that was to replace/restore Christianity. Also according to these books, this New Jerusalem began to be established around 1757. This stems from their belief that Jerusalem itself is a symbol of the Church, and so the New Jerusalem in the Bible is a prophetic description of a New Church. =Latter Day Saint= In the Latter Day Saint movement, the New Jerusalem is viewed as a physical kingdom that will be built in North America,Joseph Smith, 1842, Wentworth Letter. centered on Independence, Missouri.LDS Doctrine and Covenants 57:2. The movement refers to the New Jerusalem as Zion. The movement's founder, Joseph Smith, attempted to establish this Zion in the early 1830s, and drafted a detailed plat of Zion based on his view of the biblical description of the New Jerusalem, including plans for a temple. However, due to political and military rivalry with other Missouri settlers, members of the religion were expelled from Missouri in 1838. Subsequently, several Latter Day Saint denominations have established residence there, believing that it will be the center of God's Millennial kingdom. =Jehovah's Witnesses= Jehovah's Witnesses believe that New Jerusalem is made up of anointed Christians serving in heaven as Kings and Priests over the earth. The number of these King-Priests will eventually number 144,000. This belief is based on New Jerusalem being described as \\"a bride adorned for her husband\\" , and this same \\"bride\\" then being described as \\"the Lamb's wife\\" . is seen as depicting a wife-like relationship between the Lamb and the 144,000, therefore linking the identity of the 144,000 with the Lamb's wife and in-turn also that of New Jerusalem.Insight on the Scriptures. 2. 1988. p. 496. =Universal Friends= The religious community known collectively as the Society of Universal Friends that gathered around the Quaker evangelist known as the Public Universal Friend in the late 18th century was one of religious righteousness and devotion to Christian ideals. In 1790, the preacher founded a community called (New) Jerusalem, planned as a communal society where righteousness would prevail in the wilderness of New York's Finger Lakes region, in what is today the town of Jerusalem, New York. The society faded away after the death of their leader. =British Israelism= Richard Brothers, the originator of British Israelism, developed a viewpoint that the British are descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel, and that the capital city of Britain should therefore be re-modeled as a New Jerusalem for the coming Age of Enlightenment. Supposedly this idea was already present in 16th Century England, and that it reached its height of influence during and just after the First World War; certain buildings, such as St Paul's Cathedral, supposedly contain elements of the plan in their design. =Bedwardism= Bedwardism, a Jamaican religious movement active between 1889 and 1921, asserted that August Town (a suburb of Kingston) was the New Jerusalem for the western hemisphere, and that Union Camp, where Alexander Bedward's Free Baptist Church was located, was Zion. This movement fell apart when Bedward was arrested in 1921. =Kimbanguism= Kimbanguism, a Congolese sectarian church founded in 1921 by Simon Kimbangu, refers to Kimbangu's birthplace in Nkamba, Congo (a village near Mbanza-Ngungu), as New Jerusalem, where he reputedly performed miracles. Like Bedward, Kimbangu was imprisoned for life in the year 1921, however his movement continues with many followers to the present. The Kimbanguist believe that people of the Nkamba village saw the New Jerusalem descending from heaven (a building) physically in 1935, by which time Father Simon Kimbangu was in prison. The Kimbanguist has constructed this same design of the building, calling it Nkamba New Jerusalem, in reference to Revelation 21; it has a river with supposed healing power. =Taiping Heavenly Kingdom= In 1853, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing (Nanking) During the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing dynasty of China and renamed the city \\"New Jerusalem\\".http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cdi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context;=headwaters Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith views the New Jerusalem as the renewal of religion that takes place about every thousand years and which secures the prosperity of the human world. Bah√°'u'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, identified the New Jerusalem with his claimed revelation (the word of God), and more specifically with the Law of God. \`Abdu'l-Bah√°, Bah√°'u'll√°h's son, further explains that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not an actual city which is renewed, but the law of God since it descends from heaven through a new revelation and it is renewed. Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of \`Abdu'l-Bah√°, stated that specifically Bah√°'u'll√°h's book of laws, the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, is the new Jerusalem. Bah√°'u'll√°h, in the Tablet of Carmel, also states that the new Jerusalem had appeared upon the new Mount Zion, Mount Carmel.  Music  The Lutheran hymn \\"Jerusalem, du hochgebaute Stadt\\", with lyrics written by Johann Matth√§us Meyfart in 1626, describes entering the Heavenly Jerusalem. It was set by composers such as Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert. Carly Simon references \\"the New Jerusalem,\\" in her Oscar-winning song from Working Girl, \\"Let the River Run.\\" Progressive-rock band Genesis references \\"the New Jerusalem\\" in the final lyric of their 23-minute epic \\"Supper's Ready\\" from the 1972 album Foxtrot. In popular culture Science fiction writer Robert Heinlein wrote the story \\"If This Goes On‚Äî\\", depicting a charismatic preacher managing to be elected President of the United States and setting up a theocratic dictatorship. Among other things, the capital is moved from Washington, D.C. to \\"New Jerusalem\\". Similarly, Poul Anderson's story The Bitter BreadPublished 1975 in Analog, included in \\"Explorations\\", a Tor Book published by Tom Doherty Associates, New York 1981 is set in theocratic future where, after the Armageddon War, the ruined Earth was rebuilt - and taken over - by the World Protectorate and the Absolute Christian Church. The world capital is New Jerusalem, built on the site of Cimarron, Kansas. In American hip hop culture and the Five-Percent Nation, \\"New Jerusalem\\" and \\"New Jeru\\" refer to New Jersey.

The 1962-1979 platform underwent significant changes during its lifetime, but all of Chrysler's B-platform cars in a given model year shared the same chassis, with only styling differences between the Dodge and Plymouth models. The cars were otherwise mechanically identical. Similarly, the 1988-1992 Premier and Monaco models differed only by styling and shared the same front-wheel drive B-body platform. The Plymouth B-body series ultimately comprised four cars with nearly identical outward appearances (differing only in trim package, drive train and accessories). These were the Belvedere, Satellite, GTX and Road Runner. The Superbird was a Road Runner with an extended nose cone and front fenders borrowed from the Dodge Charger Daytona, and a high-mounted rear wing. The Superbird's unique styling was a result of homologation requirements for using the same aerodynamic nose and rear wing when racing the car in the NASCAR series of the time. There was more diversity in the outward appearance of the Dodge B-body series. The Dodge models based on the B-body were the Coronet, Super Bee and the Charger.

The driven axle is on the right; the booster normally hung behind it. Diagram showing how a booster is installed and connected. A booster engine for steam locomotives is a small two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or the lead truck on the tender. A rocking idler gear permits it to be put into operation by the driver (engineer). It drives one axle only and can be non-reversible, with one idler gear, or reversible, with two idler gears. A booster engine is used to start a heavy train or maintain low speed under demanding conditions. Rated at about at speeds of from , it can be cut in while moving at speeds under and is semi-automatically cut out via the engineer notching back the reverse gear between , depending on the model and design of the booster. A tractive effort of is common, although ratings of up to around were possible. Tender boosters are equipped with side- rods connecting axles on the lead truck. Such small side-rods restrict speed and are therefore confined to switching locomotives, often used in transfer services between yards. Tender boosters were far more rare than engine boosters.  Reasons for booster use  The booster is intended to make up for fundamental flaws in the design of the standard steam locomotive. First, most steam locomotives do not provide power to all wheels. The amount of force that can be applied to the rail depends on the weight on the driven wheels and the factor of adhesion of the wheels against the track. Unpowered wheels are generally needed to provide stability at speed, but at low speed they are not required, so they effectively 'waste' weight which could be used for traction. Second, the \\"gearing\\" of a steam locomotive is constant, because the pistons are linked directly to the wheels via rods and cranks. Therefore, a compromise must be struck between ability to haul at low speed and the ability to run fast without inducing excessive piston speeds (which would cause failure), or the exhaustion of steam. That compromise means that, at low speeds, a steam locomotive is not able to use all the power the boiler is capable of producing; it simply cannot use steam that quickly, so there is a big difference between the amount of steam the boiler can produce and the amount that can be used. The booster engine enables that wasted potential to be put to use.  Disadvantages  Boosters are costly to maintain, with their flexible steam and exhaust pipes, idler gear, etc. Improper operation could also result in undesirable drops in boiler pressure and/or damage to the booster.  Usage  =North America= The booster saw most use in North America. Railway systems elsewhere often considered the expense and complexity unjustified. Even in the North American region, booster engines were applied to only a fraction of all locomotives built. Some railroads used boosters extensively while others did not. The New York Central was a fan of booster engines and applied them to all of its 4-6-4 Hudson locomotives. The rival Pennsylvania Railroad, however, used few booster-equipped locomotives. Canadian Pacific Railway rostered 3,257 steam locomotives acquired between 1881 and 1949, yet only 55 were equipped with boosters. 17 H1 class 4-6-4s, 2 K1 class 4-8-4s and all 36 T1 class 2-10-4s. =Australia= In Australia, Victorian Railways equipped all but one of its X class 2-8-2 locomotives (built between 1929 and 1947) with a 'Franklin' two-cylinder booster engine, following a successful trial of the device on a smaller N class 2-8-2 in 1927. From 1929 onwards, South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 heavy passenger locomotives were rebuilt into 4-8-4s with the addition of a booster truck . =New Zealand= NZR's Kb class of 1939 were built with a booster truck to enable the locomotives to handle the steeper grades of some South Island lines (particularly the Cass Bank of the Midland Line). Some boosters were later removed because of the gear jamming. =Great Britain= In Great Britain, eight locomotives of four different classes on the London and North Eastern Railway were equipped with booster units by Nigel Gresley. Four were existing locomotives rebuilt with boosters between 1923 and 1932: one of class C1 (in 1923); both of the conversions from class C7 to class C9 (in 1931); and one of class S1 (in 1932). The remaining four were all fitted to new locomotives: the two P1 2-8-2 locomotives, built in 1925; and two class S1 locomotives built in 1932. The boosters were removed between 1935 and 1938, apart from those on class S1 which were retained until 1943. An early type of booster used in Great Britain was the steam tender, which was tried in 1859 by Benjamin Connor of the Caledonian Railway on four 2-4-0 locomotives. Archibald Sturrock of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) patented a similar system on 6 May 1863 (patent no. 1135). It was used on fifty GNR 0-6-0 locomotives: thirty converted from existing locomotives between 1863 and 1866, and twenty built new in 1865 (nos. 400‚Äì419). The equipment was removed from all fifty during 1867‚Äì68.

Initially introduced as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, the Chrysler minivans have been marketed under a variety of nameplates under Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Ram brands; through the use of rebadging, Chrysler minivans have also been marketed under the Lancia and Volkswagen brands. The Chrysler minivans are the highest- selling example of the segment, with over 12 million produced up to 2008 and a grand total of 15 million reached in 2019. The introduction of the Chrysler minivans popularized the use of the body style by automakers in the United States and Canada, leading to competitors such as the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Ford Aerostar, Toyota Previa, and Mazda MPV. During the 1990s, the popularity of the Chrysler minivans led to the form factor becoming closely followed by many competitors, leading to the Ford Windstar/Freestar, Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona, and Nissan Quest. Since their 1984 introduction, Chrysler has manufactured minivans at Windsor Assembly, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; from 1987 to 2007, Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri added additional manufacturing in North America. For the European market, exports were largely supplemented by the Eurostar joint-venture factory in Graz, Austria from 1992 to 2002. First generation (1984‚Äì1990) The S platform was not a modified variant of the Chrysler K platform, although the engines and transmissions used the K-car running gear. The van was a unique platform designed for the vehicle, and was used for the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Plymouth Voyager. Chrysler manufactured the Generation I minivans, internally codenamed T-115 during development from October 1983 until 1990. Models include: * 1984‚Äì1990 Dodge Caravan ** 1987‚Äì1990 Dodge Grand Caravan * 1984‚Äì1988 Dodge Mini Ram Van * 1989‚Äì1990 Dodge Caravan C/V * 1984‚Äì1990 Plymouth Voyager ** 1987‚Äì1990 Plymouth Grand Voyager * 1988‚Äì1990 Chrysler Voyager (Europe) * 1990 Chrysler Town & Country Second generation (1991‚Äì1995) Developed from 1985 to 1989, Generation II was introduced in 1990 and called AS. Design specifications were chosen in 1987 and were evolutionary. This was the last K-based version of the S platform, as the NS platform switched to a new cab forward design. Models: * 1991‚Äì1995 Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan * 1991‚Äì1995 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager * 1991‚Äì1995 Chrysler Town & Country * 1991‚Äì1995 Chrysler (Grand) Voyager/Caravan (Mexico) * 1993‚Äì1995 Chrysler TEVan (limited production electric vehicle) =ES= The ES platform is the European counterpart to the North American AS platform. Models: * 1991‚Äì1995 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager (Europe) * 1991‚Äì1995 Dodge Mini Ram Van (Netherlands) Third generation (1996‚Äì2000) Generation III of the platform was developed from early 1990 to December 26, 1994, being introduced on January 4, 1995, and called NS. Its cab forward design was defined by September 23, 1991, and inspired by the 1992 Chrysler EPIC concept minivan, designed in-house by Julie Dolan in mid-1991. Final exterior designs were development program approved in May 1992 and frozen for scheduled late 1994 production that same month. The first NS prototypes were built in November 1992 and presented on November 24, 1992, to Chrysler executive management. The 1992 \\"Reinventing Chrysler\\" documentary, provided footage of the NS design process in the spring of 1992.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hVdrBEJILA#t=530https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hVdrBEJILA#t=578 Models: * 1996‚Äì2000 Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan * 1999‚Äì2000 Dodge Caravan EPIC (limited production electric vehicle) * 1996‚Äì2000 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager * 1996‚Äì2000 Chrysler Town & Country * 2000 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager =GS= The Chrysler GS platform is the global export counterpart to the North American Chrysler NS platform.

Model: * 2001‚Äì2007 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager * 2001‚Äì2007 Dodge/Chrysler Ram Van (Netherlands, cargo van) Fifth generation (2008‚Äì2020) The fifth-generation Chrysler minivans were introduced at the 2007 North American International Auto Show for the 2008 model year, marking the debut of the RT platform. In a major change, the short-wheelbase configuration was dropped, alongside the Chrysler Town & Country, all Dodge minivans were now Grand Caravans. The export-market Chrysler Grand Voyager made its return; following the acquisition of Chrysler by Fiat, the model line was also marketed as a Lancia Voyager outside North America. The first Chrysler minivans to be powered exclusively by V6 engines (in North America), the RT platform marked the introduction of a 4.0 L SOHC V6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission. For 2011, the 3.6 L Pentastar V6 replaced all three V6 engines, remaining the sole V6 engine through current production. In Europe, the Voyager was powered by a 2.8 L VM Motori inline-4 turbodiesel; for the first time, no manual transmission was offered. For 2012, the Grand Caravan C/V cargo van shifted its branding, becoming the Ram C/V. In 2015, Ram replaced the C/V with the Ram ProMaster City (a rebadged Fiat Doblo).

Marketed by Volkswagen exclusively in the North American market, the Routan featured revised interior and exterior styling as well as different equipment content from the Chrysler vans. Production of the Routan was discontinued in 2013. Model: * 2009‚Äì2014 Volkswagen Routan = Discontinuation = On February 28, 2020, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced the discontinuation of the Dodge Grand Caravan, the last RT nameplate in production; production of the minivan was scheduled to conclude in late May but has since been delayed to mid-July.  Sixth generation (2017‚Äìpresent)  The sixth generation of the Chrysler minivan was introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, as Chrysler released the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica. Serving as a replacement for the Town & Country, the Pacifica revived the nameplate of the 2004‚Äì2008 Town & Country-derived CUV. For the first time since their 1984 introduction, Chrysler markets a different minivan than Dodge, with the latter division retaining the previous-generation Grand Caravan; the export-market Chrysler/Lancia Voyager were discontinued. Sharing the CUSW (Fiat D-Evo) platform with the Chrysler 200, the Pacifica is the first minivan sold in North America sold with a 9-speed automatic transmission; a CVT is part of the first plug-in hybrid powertrain in a minivan, offered as an option. For the 2020 model year, Chrysler reintroduced the Voyager nameplate (last seen in 2003 for the United States). Adopting the lower two trim levels of the Pacifica, the Voyager also introduces a trim level specifically for fleet sale. The option of all-wheel drive (last seen in 2004) was also reintroduced for the gasoline-only Pacifica during this model year. For the 2021 model year, Chrysler announced that the lower two trim levels of Pacifica, sold as the Voyager in the United States, will be sold under the Grand Caravan nameplate in Canada. The base L trim level is now unnamed and the LX trim level adopts the SXT designation from the outgoing Dodge Grand Caravan. Vehicles bearing the \\"Chrysler Grand Caravan\\" nameplate were last seen in 2007, primarily in South American markets.

When he left the papal choir he returned to Spain, taking a non-resident prebend at the cathedral in Segovia.Fuimara, p. 50 He had his share of difficulties while in Rome, mostly due to his short temper and illness.

A Plymouth to be called the \\"Accolade\\" was planned, but never saw production. The platform pioneered Chrysler's \\"cab-forward\\" design; featured on some Chrysler, Dodge, and Eagle cars in the 1990s and early 2000s.  Development  As the 1990s dawned, Chrysler faced a renewed round of financial troubles. The US economy slipped into a recession following the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash and the Savings and Loan Crisis, but the company's main problems were due to a lack of engineering innovation and careless spending during the years of prosperity in the 80s. Most of Chrysler's lineup was based on the proven, but dated K-car platform, plus debt accumulated from expensive purchases including Italian automaker Lamborghini along with American Motors, and critics routinely criticized their inability to produce cars that were competitive with Japanese companies or Ford, which had just struck a coup-de-grace with the Taurus line. It was also widely believed that Chairman Lee Iacocca had stayed at the helm of Chrysler too long. Thus, it was time for the automaker to make a fresh start for the 1990s. In 1992, Iacocca (who had just turned 67) was finally persuaded to retire. Although some suspected that he would later turn the leadership over to Bob Lutz, he instead designated the more conservative, straitlaced Bob Eaton as new chairman. With Chrysler facing an uncertain future in the late 80s, engineering teams were allowed to explore new designs that had been largely discouraged under Iacocca's tenure. The LH platform was based on the American Motors-developed and Renault-derived Eagle Premier. According to Bob Lutz, \\"[t]he Premier had an excellent chassis and drove so damned well that it served as a benchmark for the LH ... the spiritual father, the genetic antecedent of the LH is the Premier.\\" Like the Premier, the LH-cars featured a longitudinally-mounted engine with a front-wheel drive drivetrain, unusual in most U.S. front-wheel drive cars, but a hallmark of Renault's designs. This arrangement meant that the design team had to use a chain to connect the automatic transmission with the front differential, a design reminiscent of the original Oldsmobile Toronado though subject to greater wear and noise. The LH platform team was headed by Fran√ßois Castaing, who was previously responsible for product engineering and development at American Motors Corporation (AMC). Working with an engineering team of only 700, it took just over three years from the styling studio to the showrooms. To give focus for the platform engineering team, the benchmark target was the Eagle Premier. Exterior styling was heavily influenced by another Chrysler design which debuted as the Lamborghini Portofino, a concept car introduced at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Dodge and Eagle LH cars competed directly against the Ford Taurus and other mid-size cars, largely replacing the K-based C-bodies. The Chrysler models competed with upmarket domestics such as Buick and Oldsmobile. The LH cars debuted in 1992, and were updated in 1997. The LH platform was replaced with the rear-wheel drive Chrysler LX platform for the 2005 model year. While Chrysler's sales never rose to the levels of those popular rivals, the LH vehicles succeeded in altering Chrysler's previously dowdy public image, recasting the automaker as an innovative design leader. The cab-forward look also influenced Chrysler's subsequent compact PL (Chrysler Neon) and midsize JA platform car designs in the 1990s. Much as the company had done in the months leading up to the introduction of the K-platform cars in 1980, Chrysler referred directly to the LH platform in advertisements touting the advantages of its \\"cab-forward\\" architecture (generally meant to imply wheels moved out towards the corners of the body; a short, sloping hood; and a large windshield extending from base over the front wheels), and also referred to the platform name for the Chrysler LHS sedan. Although the real \\"gold mine\\" of Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was the Jeep brand, their minivans and LH sedans also helped to bail the company out of almost certain bankruptcy in the 1990s. First generation (1993‚Äì1997) A First generation LH car, the Chrysler Concorde 1994-97 Chrysler LHS, a first generation LH car The first generation LH cars used the existing 3.3 L OHV V6 as well as a new 3.5 L SOHC V6, and a four-speed automatic transmission. Cars that used the first version of the LH platform include: * 1993-1997 Chrysler Concorde * 1993-1997 Dodge Intrepid * 1993-1997 Eagle Vision * 1994-1996 Chrysler New Yorker * 1994-1997 Chrysler LHS All versions shared a wheelbase. One year after the original three cars were introduced, the \\"stretched\\" LHS and New Yorker had different rear bodywork providing more overall length as well as a revised rear seat providing more leg room. Originally, Chrysler came close to giving Plymouth a variant of the LH platform, called the Plymouth Accolade, a name consistent with the then-current Plymouth Acclaim. It was to be a base model below the equipment level of the Intrepid. The Accolade never made it into production. Second generation (1998‚Äì2004) 1999 Chrysler Concorde 2002 Chrysler LHS The second generation LH cars used the 2.7 L DOHC V6 and 3.2 L SOHC V6, as well as an updated version of the older 3.5, and a four-speed automatic transmission. Cars that used the second version of the LH platform include: * 1998-2004 Chrysler Concorde * 1998-2004 Dodge Intrepid * 1999-2001 Chrysler LHS * 1999-2004 Chrysler 300M * 2002-2004 Chrysler Concorde Limited When Chrysler discontinued the Eagle brand after 1998, the Chrysler 300M was introduced as a replacement for the Vision. All models again shared a wheelbase of . The 300M was several inches shorter than Concorde, Intrepid, & LHS, due to shorter front and rear overhangs in order to bring the car's length under 5 meters. Media One episode of Robert Reich's 1992 PBS miniseries Made In America focused on the then-yet-to-be-released LH's development and its role in reversing Chrysler's flagging fortunes. A camouflaged Dodge Intrepid is seen being put through the paces at Chrysler's test track, along with concept sketches and other behind-the-scenes activities.

Opening narration Plot Penny is a harried housewife with a dim-witted and hapless husband named Russell. They also have four children: Janet and Susan, who are always fighting; Bertie, who is very clumsy; and Russell Jr., who is always playing pranks. Penny's typical morning consists of preparing breakfast for her family, listening to arguing children, dealing with Russell Jr.'s pranks, cleaning up Bertie's messes, fielding her husband's complaints, etc., which is difficult for Penny to bear. One day, Penny goes to work in her garden while her neighbor loudly removes tree limbs with a chainsaw. As she digs in her garden she discovers a wooden box containing a beautiful gold pendant in the shape of a sundial. Not thinking anything of it, she takes it inside and puts it around her neck. At the grocery store, Penny struggles to deal with Bertie and Russell Jr's annoying behavior and obnoxious customers. While driving home, as Janet and Susan loudly fight, she nearly reaches a nervous breakdown. That night, while she tries to cook dinner, her children pester her again and her husband starts to complain. As the noise level reaches a fever pitch, Penny yells to shut everyone up; suddenly, everyone stops moving ‚Äî frozen in time. She soon realizes that the pendant she found in the garden is an amulet that can stop time. When she tells her family to resume conversation ‚Äî time restarts. She is happy as she realizes that she will finally have a little peace and quiet when she needs it, staving off an inevitable nervous breakdown. Later that night, Penny watches a news program about recent arms talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. She becomes annoyed and briefly freezes time. After expressing happiness, she goes to sleep. The next day, Penny uses her time-stopping power to enjoy a peaceful breakfast with her family, to shop at the grocery store without incident, and to avoid being pestered by two anti-nuclear weapons activists. In fact, she uses her newfound power to drag their frozen bodies into the yard, which, upon resuming time, frightens the protesters away from Penny's home. Later that evening, Penny enjoys a relaxing bath when air raid sirens suddenly start. She hears her husband calling loudly from the bedroom and when she investigates, the television shows the Emergency Broadcast System. The radio announces that nuclear missiles are heading for the United States from the Soviet Union. When the radio reveals that ICBMs have entered U.S. airspace, Russell and Russell Jr. begin to cry. Just as an explosion is heard in the distance, the terrified Penny freezes time, then leaves her house and walks through town toward the noise. As she reaches a street which houses the local movie theater, she notices terrified people looking skyward and is horrified to see a Soviet nuclear missile frozen a few hundred feet in the air, nose down, and moments from impact. The episode ends with Penny facing an impossible dilemma: live eternally alone in a safe but silent, motionless world, or unfreeze time and have the world be annihilated by nuclear war? Themes This episode is similar in theme to two episodes of the original series: \\"Time Enough at Last,\\" which involves a man who seeks a refuge from life by reading and gets his wish when the world ends through a nuclear war, and \\"A Kind of a Stopwatch,\\" which involves a man who gains the power to stop time using a stopwatch. The ending is also similar to a short story by Arthur C. Clarke titled \\"All the Time in the World,\\" which concludes with the lead character in possession of a time-stopping device moments before a nuclear bomb ends the world. Clarke's story was adapted for television by Tales of Tomorrow, a forerunner to the original Twilight Zone series. Background notes *In the final scene, the two films playing in the theater when Penny stops time are Dr. Strangelove and Fail Safe. Both 1964 films depict nuclear warfare.

Chrysler inherited a V8 engine from American Motors Corporation (AMC) when it bought out the automaker in 1987: *AMC 360 - American Motors' \\"GEN-3\\" V8s were introduced for the 1970 model year in AMC passenger automobiles. The \\"GEN-3\\" engines were available in Jeep utility vehicles starting in 1971. It is not the same as Chrysler's 360 V8. Chrysler continued production of the AMC 360 engine after the 1987 buyout of AMC to power the full-size Jeep Wagoneer (SJ) SUV that was produced until 1991. It was one of the last carbureted car/truck engines built in North America. Chrysler never used this engine in any other vehicle. =Big block V8= Chrysler's big-block V8s fall into the following families: *1958‚Äì1978 Chrysler B engine (350/361/383/400) *1959‚Äì1978 Chrysler RB engine (383/413/426W/440) *1964‚Äì1971 Chrysler Hemi engine (426, sometimes called the 2G or Gen 2 Hemi to distinguish from earlier and later Hemi engines.

Melody assures the parents that Debbie will be just fine and takes them to the waiting room. Debbie wanders through a hallway where a cheerful voice says, \\"To hear the parents talk: just press the red button on the side of the window.\\" Debbie is shown five displays, each with a couple of parents inside a locked room with a glass front so that they are clearly visible to outside spectators. The first couple wildly begs her to take them with her; the second couple makes violent threats; the third is sleeping so Debbie passes them; the fourth try to bribe her; and the fifth reveals that their son was seven when he brought them into the zoo and that they are very sorry for their previous transgressions.

The episode is based on the 1970 short story of the same name by Richard Matheson; the same short story forms the basis of the 2009 film The Box. In a documentary on the making of the movie The Box, Matheson states the inspiration of the story came from his wife, whose college professor had asked a similar question as a way of promoting a class discussion. Plot Arthur and Norma Lewis live in a low-rent apartment and are slowly descending into abject poverty. One day, they receive a mysterious locked box with a button atop it and a note that says Mr. Steward will come visit. Then, just as the note said, a smartly dressed stranger who introduces himself as Mr. Steward comes to their door while Arthur is away. He gives Norma the key to the box and explains that if they press the button, then two things will happen; they will receive $200,000 in cash, but, consequently, someone \\"[whom they] don't know\\" will die. After the stranger leaves, Arthur and Norma wonder whether Steward's proposal is genuine, and they debate whether to press the button. Norma rationalizes that they could make good use of the money and that the one who dies might be an old Chinese peasant or a person with cancer. Arthur hypothesizes that pressing the button could cause the death of an innocent baby. They open the box and discover it to be empty, with no mechanism that the button could for whatever purpose activate. Arthur angrily throws the box in the trash and tells Norma to forget the whole scheme. He remarks that Mr. Steward can find his $200,000 in the city dump; however, after Arthur goes to bed, Norma retrieves the box from the dumpster outside the building. The next day, as Arthur leaves for work, he sees Norma sitting at the kitchen table transfixed by the button. Finally, she decides to push the button much to her husband's disgust. The next day, Mr. Steward returns and takes back the box, giving the shocked couple a briefcase with the $200,000. Norma asks what is to be done with the money, to which Steward remarks that they should spend it. Norma also asks what will happen to the box and Steward replies that the button will be \\"reprogrammed\\" and offered to someone else with the same terms and conditions. Just before leaving, Steward focuses on Norma and ominously states, \\"I can assure you it will be offered to someone whom you don't know\\"...leaving Norma with a horrified look on her face. Short story \\"Button, Button\\" was first published in Playboy, June 1970, a short story written by Richard Matheson. The story was republished as part of a collection of Matheson's short stories. In the original short story, the plot is resolved differently. Norma presses the button, and receives the money--after her husband dies in a train incident, where he is pushed onto the tracks (the money was the no-fault insurance settlement, which is $50,000 instead of the $200,000 in the Twilight Zone episode). A despondent Norma asks the stranger why her husband was the one who was killed. The stranger replies, \\"Do you really think you knew your husband?\\" Matheson strongly disapproved of the Twilight Zone version, especially the new ending, and used his pseudonym Logan Swanson for the teleplay. Film The Box, a feature film based on this story, starring Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, was released in 2009. The Twilight Zone episode is played out within the first hour, followed by further events within the context of the film's additional plot. Basil Hoffman, the actor who plays Steward in the Twilight Zone episode, also appears in the film, but as character Don Poates.The Box cast and crew list at the Internet Movie Database Radio A radio-play version of the story is written by Henry Slesar, who also produced the radio program.

Plot Peter Wood is a teenager sick with a fever that puts him in telepathic contact with Charity Payne, a Puritan girl from Colonial Massachusetts (specifically 1700), who also has the same type of fever. The two share realistic thought- visions of each other's worlds and Charity has a glimpse of the world in the year 1985. The teenagers discover they can communicate and form a true friendship. When Charity is discovered (when she tries to humble a know-it-all neighbor girl) she is branded a witch for her knowledge of future events. Now her friend from the future must help her escape the clutches of her villagers and prove she is not a witch before she is tried and executed. Peter discovers an historical record that two dead bodies would be discovered near Charity's township, which had been proven to be men whom the judge murdered over a deal gone wrong. However, the judge died of a heart attack prior to the discovery, and the Crown confiscated his lands since they could not try him. At her trial, Charity claims this is not witchcraft, but second sight. Charity tells of a dead sea captain and another man, causing the judge to find her not guilty. Afterward, Charity tells Peter that they probably should not go on communicating, lest more problems arise. Peter sadly agrees and they bid each other goodbye.

He was an important politician in the Balkans, who, together with his counterparts like Eleftherios Venizelos in Greece, managed to strengthen their emergent national states against foreign influence and interference, most notably those of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire. Early life Pa≈°iƒá was born in Zajeƒçar, Principality of Serbia. According to Slovenian ethnologist Niko Zupaniƒç, Pa≈°iƒá's ancestors migrated from the Tetovo region in the 16th century and founded the village of Zvezdan near Zajeƒçar. Pa≈°iƒá himself said that his ancestors settled from the area of the Le≈°ok Monastery in Tetovo. Jovan Duƒçiƒá concluded that Pa≈°iƒá hailed from Veliki Izvor near Zajeƒçar, and that Pa≈°iƒá's ancestry in Tetovo had been long lost. Bulgarian ethnologist Stilian Chilingirov stated that Pashiƒá's roots were from the village of Veliki Izvor, founded during the 18th century by refugees from the village of Golyam Izvor in Teteven area in today Bulgaria.–ß–∏–ª–∏–Ω–≥–∏—Ä–æ–≤, –°—Ç–∏–ª–∏—è–Ω. –ö–∞–∫–≤–æ –µ –¥–∞–ª –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∏. 1938, 1939, 1941, 1991, 2006. —Å. 90-91. Ljubomir Miletiƒá also claimed that Pa≈°iƒá's grandfather settled in Veliki Izvor from Teteven area, which was refuted by Serbian authors. claiming his parents were both born in Zajeƒçar. However, the village of Veliki Izvor, was really founded by refugees from the village of Golyam Izvor, Teteven area.–ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –æ—Ç —Ç–µ—Ç–µ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ —Å–µ–ª–æ –ì–æ–ª—è–º –∏–∑–≤–æ—Ä –≥–æ—Å—Ç—É–≤–∞—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏ –∏–∑–≤–æ—Ä, –æ–±—â–∏–Ω–∞ –ó–∞–π—á–∞—Ä, –°—ä—Ä–±–∏—è. 27 –°–µ–ø 2018 –≥. –û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª–µ–Ω —Å–∞–π—Ç –Ω–∞ –û–±—â–∏–Ω–∞ –¢–µ—Ç–µ–≤–µ–Ω. Carlo Sforza mentioned that Pa≈°iƒá \\"was lucky in another respect, he belonged to the Shopi community\\". Pa≈°iƒá studied at the Zajeƒçar gymnasium, but as the gymnasium was returned to Negotin (where it was first founded) for political reasons, he studied in Negotin and Kragujevac. In 1866, he enrolled in the Belgrade Higher School, where he excelled in his studies and in 1868 received a state scholarship to study at the Polytechnical School in Z√ºrich, for further specialization. Pa≈°iƒá graduated as an engineer but, apart from his brief participation in the construction of the Vienna- Budapest railroad, he never worked in this field. Radical Party =Origins= A colony of Serbian students lived in Switzerland where they became acquainted with the ideas of Socialism. They would later become the core of the Socialist and Radical movement in Serbia. One of them was Svetozar Markoviƒá, who would become the first major socialist ideologue in Serbia. During his studies in Z√ºrich, Pa≈°iƒá befriended Markoviƒá, as well as Pera Velimiroviƒá, Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá, and others. After returning to Serbia, Pa≈°iƒá distanced himself from Markoviƒá, though they never argued, and went to Bosnia to support the anti-Ottoman uprising of Nevesinjska pu≈°ka . The Socialists started publishing Samouprava which later became the official bulletin of the Radical Party. After Markoviƒá's death in 1875, Pa≈°iƒá became the leader of the movement and in 1878 was elected to the National Assembly of Serbia, even before the party was formed. In 1880, he made an unprecedented move in the Serbian political scene by forming an opposition deputies' club in the assembly. Finally, a party program was completed in January 1881 and the Radical Party, the first systematically organized Serbian party, was officially established, with Pa≈°iƒá unanimously elected its first president. =Timok Rebellion= The party and Pa≈°iƒá quickly gained popularity; the Radicals received 54 percent of the vote in the September 1883 elections, while the Progressive Party, favored by King Milan Obrenoviƒá IV only got 30 percent. Despite the Radicals' clear victory, the pro-Austrian king, who disliked the pro-Russian Pa≈°iƒá and the Radical party, nominated old non- partisan hardliner Nikola Hristiƒá to form a government. By one decree Hristiƒá opened the assembly and then he read a second one, dismissing it. This already heated atmosphere was made worse by the decision to take away guns from the population, as a regular army was to be established. As a result, clashes began in eastern Serbia, in the Timok valley. King Milan blamed the unrest on the Radicals and sent troops to crush the rebellion. Pa≈°iƒá was sentenced to death in absentia and he narrowly avoided arrest by fleeing to Bulgaria. Twenty-one others were sentenced to death and executed, and 734 more were imprisoned. =Exile in Bulgaria= For the next six years, Pa≈°iƒá lived with relatives in Bulgaria, supported by the Bulgarian government. He lived in Sofia, where he worked as building contractor, and worked for a short time in the Ministry of Interior According to Bulgarian sources, he spoke quite fluent Bulgarian, but mixed it with a large number of Serbian words and phrases, and it is claimed that he asked Petko Karavelov's friends who hailed from Stara Planina about the characteristics of that region in Bulgaria, explaining that his ancestors had migrated from there to Serbia some generations before. Bulgarian testimonies completely differ in one important respect, whether Pa≈°iƒá worked actively in politics during his exile in Sofia. The official Bulgarian support became one of several reasons for Milan's decision to start the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885. After suffering a decisive defeat, Milan granted an amnesty for those sentenced for the Timok rebellion, but not for Pa≈°iƒá, who remained in Bulgarian exile until Milan's abdication in 1889. A few days later the newly formed Radical cabinet of Sava Grujiƒá pardoned Pa≈°iƒá. High politics 1890‚Äì1903 =President of assembly and mayor= On 13 October 1889, Pa≈°iƒá was elected president of the National Assembly, a duty he would perform (de jure though, not de facto) until 9 January 1892. He was also elected mayor of Belgrade from 11 January 1890 to 26 January 1891. His presiding over the assembly saw the largest number of laws being voted in the history of Serbian parliamentarism, while as the mayor of Belgrade he was responsible for cobbling the muddy city streets. He was reelected twice as president of the National Assembly from 13 June 1893 to April 1895 (though from September 1893 only in name; his deputy Dimitrije Katiƒá acted for him) and 12 July 1897 to 29 June 1898 and once more mayor of Belgrade 22 January 1897 to 25 November 1897.Dragnich (1998) pp 36-37. After wisely not accepting to head the government immediately after his return from exile, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá became prime minister for the first time on 23 February 1891. However, ex-king Milan returned to Serbia in May 1890 and again began campaigning against Pa≈°iƒá and the Radicals. On 16 June 1892, Kosta Protiƒá, one of three regents during the minority of Alexander Obrenoviƒá V, died. Under the constitution, the National Assembly was to elect a new regent, but as the assembly was on a several months vacation, Pa≈°iƒá had to call for an emergency session. Jovan Ristiƒá, the most powerful regent, fearing Pa≈°iƒá might be elected co-regent and thus undermine his position, refused to allow the extra session, and Pa≈°iƒá resigned as prime minister on 22 August 1892. During his tenure, he was also foreign minister from 2 April 1892 and acting finance minister from 3 November 1891. =Alexander's coup d'√©tat= After King Alexander declared himself of age ahead of time and dismissed the regency, he offered a moderate Radical Lazar Dokiƒá to form a government. Though he received approval from some members of the Radical party to participate in the government, Pa≈°iƒá refused. In order to exclude him from the political scene in Serbia, Alexander sent Pa≈°iƒá as his extraordinary envoy to Saint Petersburg, Russia, 1893‚Äì1894. In 1896, the king managed to force Pa≈°iƒá to back off from pushing for constitutional reforms. However, since 1897 both kings, Milan and Alexander, ruled almost jointly; as both disliked Pa≈°iƒá, in 1898 they had him imprisoned for 9 months because Samouprava published a statement about his previous opposition to King Milan. Pa≈°iƒá claimed he was misquoted, with no effect. =Ivandan's assassination attempt= Former fireman, ƒêura Kne≈æeviƒá, who was sentenced to death, tried to assassinate ex-king Milan in June 1899 (Serbian: –ò–≤–∞–Ω–¥–∞—ö—Å–∫–∏ –∞—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ç). The same evening, Milan declared that the Radical Party tried to kill him and all heads of the Radical Party were arrested, including Pa≈°iƒá who had just been released from prison from his previous sentence. Milan's anti-Radical accusations were groundless and even Austria-Hungary, his major ally, admitted that the Radical Party was not involved, despite Milan's insistence that at least Nikola Pa≈°iƒá and Kosta Tau≈°anoviƒá be sentenced to death. Austria-Hungary feared that the execution of the pro-Russian Pa≈°iƒá would force Russia to intervene, abandoning an 1897 agreement to leave Serbia in status-quo. A special envoy was sent from Vienna to Milan to warn him that Austria would boycott the Obrenoviƒá dynasty if Pa≈°iƒá was executed. Noted Serbian historian Slobodan Jovanoviƒá later claimed that the entire assassination was staged so that Milan could get rid of the Radical Party. Imprisoned and unaware of Austria-Hungary's interference, Pa≈°iƒá confessed that the Radical Party had been disloyal to the dynasty, which probably saved many people from prison. As part of the deal reached with the interior minister ƒêorƒëe Genƒçiƒá, government officially left its own role out of the statement, so it looked like Pa≈°iƒá behaved cowardly and succumbed to the pressure. Pa≈°iƒá was sentenced to five years but released immediately. This caused future conflict within the Radical Party as younger members considered Pa≈°iƒá a coward and traitor, and split from the party. For the remainder of Alexander's rule, Pa≈°iƒá retired from politics. Although the young monarch disliked Pa≈°iƒá, he was often summoned for consultations but would refrain from giving advice and insist that he is no longer involved with politics. Golden age of democracy 1903‚Äì1914 =Royal assassination= Nikola Pa≈°iƒá was not among the conspirators who plotted to assassinate King Alexander. The assassination occurred on the night of , and both the King and Queen Draga Ma≈°in were killed, as well as Prime Minister Dimitrije Cincar-Markoviƒá and Defence Minister Milovan Pavloviƒá. The Radical Party did not form the first cabinet after the coup d'√©tat, but after winning the elections on 4 October 1903, they remained in almost uninterrupted power for the next 15 years. Wisely, Pa≈°iƒá didn't lead all the Radical cabinets, letting other members of his party (or sometimes outside of it) be prime ministers. In the beginning, the Radicals opposed the appointment of a new king, Peter I Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, calling his appointment illegal. But Pa≈°iƒá later changed his mind after seeing how people willingly accepted the new monarch as well as king Peter I, educated in Western Europe, was a democratic, mild ruler, unlike the last two despotic and erratic Obrenoviƒá sovereigns. As it will be shown in the next two decades, the major clash between the king and the prime minister will be Pa≈°iƒá's refusal to raise to royal appanage. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá became foreign minister on 8 February 1904 in Sava Grujiƒá's cabinet and headed a government under his own presidency 10 December 1904 to 28 May 1905, continuing as foreign minister as well. During the following decade, under the leadership of Pa≈°iƒá and the Radical Party, Serbia grew so prosperous that many historians call this period the modern golden age of Serbia. The country evolved into a European democracy and with financial and economic growth, political influence also grew which caused constant problems with Serbia's largest neighbor, Austria-Hungary, which even developed plans to turn Serbia into one of its provinces (already in 1879 German chancellor Otto von Bismarck said that Serbia is the stumbling-block in Austria's development). =Austro-Hungarian customs war= As Austro-Hungarian latent provocations of Serbia concerning Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, officially still part of the Ottoman Empire but occupied by Austria-Hungary since 1878 and causing problems to Serbian export which mainly went through Austria (as Serbia is landlocked) didn't bring results, Austria- Hungary began open customs war in 1906. Pa≈°iƒá formed another cabinet 30 April 1906 to 20 July 1908. Pressured by the Austrian government which asked from Serbia to buy everything from Austrian companies, from salt to cannons, he replied to Austrian government that he personally would do that, but that the assembly is against it and in democratic countries that's what counts. Austria closed the borders which did cause severe blow to Serbian economy initially, but later it will bounce back even more developed than it was, thanks to the Pa≈°iƒá swift change towards the Western European countries. He forced conspirators of the 1903 coup into retirement which was a condition for reestablishing diplomatic connections with the United Kingdom, he bought cannons from France, etc. In the midst of the customs war, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 which caused mass protests in Serbia and political instability, but Pa≈°iƒá managed to calm the situation down. In this period, Pa≈°iƒá's major ally, Imperial Russia, was not much of a help being defeated by Japan in Russo-Japanese War and under series of revolutions. =Balkan Wars= Pa≈°iƒá with the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, in 1913 Pa≈°iƒá formed two more cabinets (24 October 1909 to 4 July 1911 and from 12 September 1912). He was one of the major players in the formation of the Balkan League which later resulted in the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì13) and the Second Balkan War (1913) which almost doubled the size of Serbia with the territories of what was at the time considered Old Serbia (Kosovo, Metohija and Vardar Macedonia), retaken from the Ottomans after five centuries. He clashed with some military structures about the handling of the newly acquired territories. Pa≈°iƒá believed the area should be included into the Serbian political and administrative system through the democratic elections, while the army sought to keep the areas under the military occupation. After one year of tensions Pa≈°iƒá dismissed the military administrator of Old Serbia and scheduled new elections for 1914 but the outbreak of World War I prevented it. =Outbreak of the Great War= After the Assassination in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 when members of the Serbian revolutionary organization Young Bosnia assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir-apparent Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian government immediately accused the Serbian government of being behind the assassination. The general consensus today is that government did not organize it, but how much Pa≈°iƒá knew about it is still a controversial issue and it appears that every historian has its own opinion on the subject: Pa≈°iƒá knew nothing (ƒÜoroviƒá); Pa≈°iƒá knew something is about to happen and told Russia that Austria would attack Serbia before the assassination (Dragniƒá); Pa≈°iƒá knew but as the assassins were connected to the powerful members of the Serbian intelligence, was afraid to do anything about it personally so he warned Vienna (Balfour). Austria presented him the July Ultimatum, written together with the envoys of the German ambassadors in such a vein which pro-Serbians claim that no country could accept it. After extensive consultations in country itself and formidable pressure from outside to accept it, Pa≈°iƒá told the Austrian ambassador Giesl (who had already packed his bags) that Serbia accepts all the ultimatum demands except that Austrian police can independently travel throughout Serbia and conduct its own investigation. This refusal confirmed to Austria that the Serbian government, at least indirectly via the \\"Black Hand\\", lay behind the assassination which was thus seen as a declaration of war against Austria, in all except words. Austria-Hungary answered by formally declaring war on Serbia on 28 July 1914. World War I and Yugoslavia =Glory, defeat and the South Slav state= From the left: A. Trumbiƒá, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Milenko Vesniƒá and Ivan ≈Ωolger. Serbian defeat was considered to be imminent, at least by external onlookers, compared to the strength of the Austria-Hungary. Serbia had obviously prepared well, however, and after a series of battles in 1914‚Äì1915 (Battle of Cer, Battle of Kolubara), the loss and recapture of Belgrade, and a Serbian counter-offensive with occupation of some Austrian territories (in Syrmia and eastern Bosnia), the Austrian army backed off. On 5 July 1914, things changed as old King Peter I relinquished his duties to the heir apparent Alexander, making him his regent. On 17 September 1914, Pa≈°iƒá and Albanian leader Essad Pasha Toptani signed in Ni≈° the secret Treaty of Serbian-Albanian Alliance. The treaty had 15 points which focused on setting up joint Serbian-Albanian political and military institutions and military alliance of Albania and Kingdom of Serbia. Also treaty envisaged building of the rail-road to Durres, a financial and military support of Kingdom of Serbia to Essad Pasha's position of Albanian ruler and drawing of the demarcation by special Serbo-Albanian commission. In October 1914, Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing, he established armed forces in Dib√´r and captured the interior of Albania and Dures. Pa≈°iƒá ordered that his followers be aided with money and arms.Serbian government and Essad Pasha Toptani, balkania.tripod.com; accessed 24 September 2016. Unlike Peter, Alexander was not a democratic spirit, rather a dictatorial one and personally disliked Pa≈°iƒá and talk of democracy. Open strife began very soon, when Serbia was proposed the London Pact by which it was supposed to expand into most of the ethnic Serbian territories to the west, including a section of the Adriatic coast and some ethnic Albanian territories in northern Albania. In return, Serbia was supposed to relinquish part of Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria so that the latter would enter the war on the Entente side. Both Pa≈°iƒá and regent Alexander were against this as they considered it to be the betrayal of the Croatians, Slovenians and Serbian sacrifices in the Balkan Wars, as negotiations for the future South Slav state already began. However, Pa≈°iƒá and king Peter were not personally much for the Yugoslav idea unlike the regent who pushed the issue for creating as large a state as possible. Serbia refused the pact and was attacked by Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria. The Government and the army retreated to the south in the direction of Greece, but were cut off by Bulgarian forces and had to go through Albania and to the Greek island of Corfu where the Corfu Declaration was signed in 1917 preparing the ground for the future South Slav state of Yugoslavia. =Creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes= The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SHS) was officially proclaimed on 1 December 1918, and, being the Prime Minister of Serbia at that time, Pa≈°iƒá was generally considered the de facto Prime Minister of the new South Slav state, as well. The political agreement was reached that Pa≈°iƒá would continue on as Prime Minister when the first government of the new state was to be formed, but as a result of his longtime dislike of Pa≈°iƒá, regent Alexander nominated Stojan Protiƒá to form the government. Consequently, Pa≈°iƒá stepped down on 20 December 1918. Despite being removed from the government, as the most experienced of politicians, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá was the main negotiator for the new state at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. In an effort to secure the maximalist agenda of the regent, he did not push on the question of the Czech Corridor, Timi»ôoara, and Szeged, managed to secure borders with Albania and Bulgaria, but failed to annex Fiume (which became an independent state) and most of Carinthia (which remained part of Austria). At the time when Benito Mussolini was willing to modify the Treaty of Rapallo, which cut off a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory from the remaining three-quarters of Slovenes living in the Kingdom of SHS, in order to annex the independent state of Rijeka to Italy, Pa≈°iƒá's attempts to correct the borders at Postojna and Idrija were undermined by regent Alexander preferring \\"good relations\\" with Italy.ƒåermelj, L. (1955). Kako je pri≈°lo do prijateljskega pakta med Italijo in kraljevino SHS (How the Friendship Treaty between Italy and the Kingdom of SHS Came About in 1924), Zgodovinski ƒçasopis, 1-4, p. 195, Ljubljana. Elections held on 28 November 1920 showed that the Radical Party was the second strongest in the country, having just one seat less than the Yugoslav Democratic Party (91 to 92, respectively, out of 419 seats). However, Pa≈°iƒá managed to form a coalition and became prime minister again on 1 January 1921. Pa≈°iƒá became a very large landowner in the country due to expropriation of Albanian land in Kosovo and other areas. =Vidovdan Constitution= As soon as talks about the constitution of the new state began, two diametrically opposite sides, Serbian and Croatian, were established. Both Pa≈°iƒá and regent Alexander wanted a unitary state but for different reasons. Pa≈°iƒá considered that the Serbs could be outvoted in such a state and that an unconsolidated and heterogeneous entity would fall apart if it was a federal one, while the regent simply didn't like to share power with others, which was shown 8 years later when he conducted a coup d'√©tat. Stjepan Radiƒá, a leading Croatian politician for a joint Serbian-Croatian state would be a temporary solution on the way to Croatian independence, asked for a federal republic. As Pa≈°iƒá had majority in the assembly, a new constitution was proclaimed on Vidovdan (St. Vitus day), 28 June 1921, organizing the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a parliamentary (albeit highly unitary) monarchy, abolishing even the remaining shreds of autonomy which had Slovenia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Vojvodina (provincial governments). In the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of Prime Minister Pa≈°iƒá used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphletsBalkan Politics, TIME Magazine, 31 March 1923. and other measures of election rigging to keep the opposition, mainly the autonomy-minded Croats, in minority in the Yugoslav parliament.Elections, TIME Magazine, 23 February 1925.The Opposition, TIME Magazine, 6 April 1925. Pa≈°iƒá's grave at the Belgrade New Cemetery. The grave of Janko Vukotiƒá can be seen to the right. Pa≈°iƒá remained Prime Minister until 8 April 1926, with a short break 27 July 1924 to 6 November 1924, when the government was headed by Ljuba Davidoviƒá. After relinquishing temporarily the post to his party colleague Nikola Uzunoviƒá, now a king, Alexander refused to reappoint Pa≈°iƒá using as a pretext the scandals of Pa≈°iƒá's son Rade. The following day, on 10 December 1926, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá suffered a heart attack and died in Belgrade, about a week before his 81st birthday. He was interred in Belgrade's New Cemetery. Milenko Vesniƒá is interred to the right of Pa≈°iƒá's grave and Janko Vukotiƒá is interred to the left of the grave.Beogradska groblja profile Politicial views =Anticommunist= Pa≈°iƒá was widely criticized by the Communists as he prevented them from participating in the political life after the 1920 elections and the series of terrorist attacks by the Communists on government officials, and banned the Communist party officially proclaiming it a criminal organization on 21 August 1921. In the early 1920s, he was accused of using police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets and other measures of election rigging to keep the opposition, mainly the separatist Stjepan Radiƒá, in minority in Yugoslav parliament. After 1945, he was condemned by the new Communist authorities and was labeled a leader of the \\"great Serbian hegemony\\", with his accomplishments in building modern Serbia being completely pushed aside. =Proposed Serbian dominance= He has been assailed because of the unitary composition of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and his opinion that Serbs, being the plurality, should always have the leading role. Opposing the joint South Slavic state from the beginning, he was accused of pushing the Greater Serbian agenda, national concept of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade. The Croatian Communist theoretician Otokar Ker≈°ovani coined a phrase about Pa≈°iƒá: \\"His name will remain in history more because it is connected to historical events, rather than the historical events being connected to his name\\". Private life Nikola Pa≈°iƒá and his daughter Pava. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá married ƒêurƒëina Dukoviƒá, daughter of a wealthy Serbian grains trader from Trieste. They were married in the Russian church in Florence to avoid the gathering of the numerous Serbian colony in Trieste and had three children: son Radomir-Rade and daughters Dara and Pava. Radomir-Rade had two sons: Vladislav, an architect (died 1978) and (1918‚Äì2015), an Oxford University law graduate who resided in Toronto, Canada, where he founded a Serbian National Academy. Legacy Monument to Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square, Belgrade A central square in Belgrade is named after him, Square of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá (Serbian: –¢—Ä–≥ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–µ –ü–∞—à–∏—õ–∞/Trg Nikole Pa≈°iƒáa). During Communist regime, the square was named after Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The 4.2 meter tall bronze statue of Pa≈°iƒá is erected on the square, overlooking the building of the assembly. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. Pa≈°iƒá was awarded the Russian Order of the White Eagle with brilliants, Order of Carol I and Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star.

Plot Sam (Sherman Hemsley) is a college professor who is frustrated at his multiple failures to solve a complex mathematical equation, angrily exclaiming, \\"I'd sell my soul to get this thing right!\\" A demon (Ron Glass) instantly appears and announces that Sam's math problem \\"had the right phonetic structure to be a good old-fashioned demonic invocation.\\" He makes it known that he intends to steal his soul and sell it to otherworldly bidders. Despite Sam's protests that the \\"selling my soul\\" remark was an idle afterthought, the demon explains that it set the deal in motion anyway. The demon also explains that Hell has been able to thrive due to the real world's weakening belief in spirituality, remarking \\"You bring up Dante to most people these days, and they ask how you liked Gremlins!\\" The demon says the term will be as follows: Sam is permitted to ask three questions about how the process works or of demonic powers. Sam is then permitted to ask a fourth question or make a request of the demon. If the demon fails to perform the task or is unable to answer the question, the deal is off and Sam's soul is spared. When Sam unthinkingly asks \\"Really?\\" the demon responds \\"Yes, really,\\" and that Sam has posed his first question. Frustrated by the trick, Sam carefully plans the second question. He asks if there are any physical limitations to the demon's powers. The demon gleefully claims that he is able to travel faster than the speed of light and can make two electrons occupy the same quantum state, and that he further has access to every bit of recorded information in multiple universes. For the third question, Sam queries if there is any place from which the demon cannot find his way back. The demon chides Sam and informs him that he can move through galaxies in a microsecond and even see alternate history timelines, such as \\"Berlin if the Nazis had won the war\\" or Rome had Alexander the Great \\"lived to a ripe old age.\\" He then demands that Sam pose his final question or task. Sam calmly provides the impossible task: \\"Get lost.\\" Defeated, the demon screams and melts away, leaving only his sunglasses. Sam throws them away and turns back to his math problem with a rueful smile, noting, \\"Well, that guy wasn't any help at all.\\" Closing narration See also *Omnipotence paradox Notes The teleplay was based on a short story by Joe Haldeman which first appeared in the June, 1970 issue of Fantastic Stories magazine (Volume 19, no. 5). In the original short story, the exclamation that is tacked onto a string of math to summon the demon is \\"no, goddammit,\\" which is possibly censored for television. The demon plans to eat Sam's soul rather than sell it; he observes, \\"Unfortunately the loss of your soul will drop your intelligence to that of a vegetable ‚Äî I am also a vegetarian.\\" When the demon has been banished (his final words being \\"You and Ernest Hemingway!\\"), Sam plays with the Fermat's Theorem disproof fragment the demon left behind and thinks about summoning the demon and tricking him again. The final sentence is fashioned after Aesop and suggests that if there was a devil there must also be a God, \\"watching his language.\\" A boom mic is briefly visible at the top of the screen in the scene where the devil is telling Sam about selling his soul to the big chains. The inside joke about Dante was likely homage to Joe Dante directing multiple episodes of the show.

The original story is the first of three fairy tales contained as entry 39 in the German Grimm's Fairy Tales under the common title \\"Die Wichtelm√§nner\\". In her translation of 1884 Margaret Hunt chose The Elves as title for these three stories.\\"Household Tales by brothers Grimm\\" at gutenberg.org The first tale is of Aarne-Thompson (AT) type 503* ('Helpful Elves'), also classified as a migratory legend (AT-7015). The second is of AT 476* type ('A Widwife [or Godmother] for the Elves'), also categorized as a migratory legend (AT 5070). The third tale is of AT 504 type ('The Changeling'), also categorized as a migratory legend (AT 5085).  Origin  The set of related tales was published by the Brother Grimms in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen (1812), as tale no. 39. Their versions of the three stories are based upon the accounts of Gretchen Wild (1787‚Äì1819). In the first edition, the three stories are subtitled \\"The Shoemaker for Whom They Did Work\\", \\"The Servant Girl Who Stood In as Godmother for Them\\", and \\"The Woman Whose Child They Exchanged\\", respectively, although the Grimms did not give titles to the individual tales in later editions. Story = First tale = A poor hardworking shoemaker had so little leather that he could only make a single pair of shoes. One evening, leaving the pair with the work unfinished, he went to bed and commended himself to God. After waking up the next morning and saying his prayers, he found the shoes completely finished and perfectly well-made in his workbench. A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, \\"Why don't we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,\\" and his wife agreed. Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after they work was completely finished. The next morning, his wife said, \\"The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing.\\" She proposed to make clothes, and the shoemaker agreed to make a pair of shoes for each of them. They did not stop until they had finished the work, and they hid themselves again. The couple saw at that night the little men delighted as they tried the beautiful little clothes and shoes; then they danced out of house and never returned, but the shoemaker prospered in his business. = Second tale = A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile. Since she could not read, the servant took the letter to her masters. They told her that she had been invited to an elf baptism and asked to become the godmother of the child. The girl hesitated at first, but her master finally convinced her to accept. Then the servant girl was led by the elves to their hollow mountain, where everything was smaller but also more splendidly ornamented. The girl helped with the baptism and asked to leave, but the elves convinced her to stay three days with them. The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain. As she returned home, the servant girl learned that she did not spend three days with elves but seven years. Meanwhile, her former masters had died. = Third tale = A woman had her child taken by elves and substituted with a changeling. Her neighbour advised her to set the changeling on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells. The woman did everything her neighbour had said, and the changeling started to laugh about her cooking in shells. Then a band of little elves appeared, brought the rightful child, set it on the hearth, and took the changeling away. Cultural legacy Friz Freleng created a musical adaption of the story for his 1946 Merrie Melodies cartoon Holiday for Shoestrings. Four years later, Tex Avery adapted the story for his 1950 MGM cartoon short The Peachy Cobbler. The 1956 Looney Tunes cartoon short Yankee Dood It is based on this fairy tale, with Elmer Fudd as the king of industrial elves. 150 years after this fairy tale took place, he visits the shoemaker to retrieve the elves he has employed, while also imparting the virtues of mass production capitalism to him. The same basic plot was also used in the 1946 cartoon short Holiday for Shoestrings. In the Due South episode, \\"The Deal\\", Det. Ray Vecchio vaguely recollects this story when discussing a poor cobbler with his partner, Constable Fraser. In Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love, a spinoff miniseries of the Vertigo comic-book series Fables, the shoemaker appears as an employee in Cinderella's shoe store, while the elves are the builders and suppliers of the store's inventory. Muppet Classic Theater had a version where a shoemaker (played by Kermit the Frog) faces ruin until his livelihood is saved by a group of philanthropic entertainers (played by The Elvises) who, naturally, make only blue suede shoes. In a Barney & Friends episode called If the Shoe Fits..., the kids are rehearsing for their play about this story. In the Harry Potter series of books, there are a large number of House Elves. These elves take care of the needs of human wizards. They are also free of their obligation once given clothes. In the TV show Supernatural, the season 6 episode Clap Your Hands If You Believe has a variation of the tale, of a watchmaker and some fairies. In Jane Shields and Rosemary Doyle's The Shoemaker and the Pantomimes Cinderella goes looking for elves to help her father in his obligation to the evil designer Kenneth Coal, but all she ends up with are Mimes, a resourceful mother Twanky, and an even more resourceful cat. Premiered Red Sandcastle Theatre, Toronto, 2012. The fairytale is alluded to in two episodes of The Big Bang Theory. In The Extract Obliteration, Leonard Hofstadter mentions it to Penny after he does her essay for her. In The Bus Pants Utilization, Sheldon greets Leonard in the morning with \\"Good morning, Shoemaker\\", in reference to the fact that he has been up all night working on Leonard's differential equations app project. In the 2003 Christmas movie Elf, shoe making is one of the jobs for elves.

Personal life He was born the son of Joseph Sheepshanks, a Leeds textile manufacturer of the well-to-do Sheepshank family of Bilton, Harrogate. His brother was John Sheepshanks (clothing manufacturer and art collector), and his sister was Anne Sheepshanks (astronomical benefactor). He received his education at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1816. He was called to the bar in 1824 and took orders in Church of England in 1825, but did not practise either profession as the death of his father left him with sufficient wealth to pursue his scientific interests. He had six children from a relationship with an Irish dancer,Walter Sickert: The Complete Writings on Art By Walter Sickert, Walter Richard Sickert, Anna Gruetzner Robins, Published by Oxford University Press, 2000 , one of whom was Eleanor Louisa Moravia Henry, also known as Nelly, mother of the painter Walter Sickert and the feminist Helena Swanwick. Sheepshanks gave financial support to the dancer and her husband, who in turn claimed paternity. Professional life From 1817 until his death Sheepshanks was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge where he was an active astronomer. He served as editor of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and greatly improved their content. In 1830 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1832, he got involved in the lawsuit of Edward Troughton against Sir James South, in which Troughton demanded payment for an equatorial mounting that he had supplied to South, but which South claimed to be defective. Sheepshanks informally served as legal counsel to Troughton; South's legal counsel was Drinkwater Bethune. Troughton prevailed in the lawsuit. In 1833, he recommended withholding publication of an early edition of Stephen Groombridge's star catalogue, which was being published posthumously, after discovering the edition contained errors. A final corrected edition was later published in 1838 under the auspices of George Biddell Airy. In his later career he worked on establishing a standard of length for imperial measures. He was reportedly deeply sceptical of the work of Charles Babbage and of his ability to deliver a working Difference Engine or Analytical Engine. The two men publicly criticized each other. Death and legacy He suffered a stroke (\\"apoplexy\\") on 29 July 1855, died on 4 August and was buried at Trinity College.

Plot The Wrights, a young married couple, wake up on April 27, 1986 to the sounds of construction. When they investigate they find time has stopped. Meanwhile, a crew of blue-clad construction workers are busy removing the furniture in their house and replacing it with new. In terror, the Wrights run outside to find things being rebuilt all over the neighborhood - things that have already existed. The Wrights start to go in the direction of a voice which seems to be commanding the workers, but then turn once the voice commands the workers to capture the Wrights. Confused and frightened, the couple run into a back alley and enter a void of white space. They discover a man in yellow who helps them out of the void and explains to them that he is the supervisor of the maintenance of time. They have somehow slipped into a loophole and while they should be in an earlier time - 9:33 a.m. - for some reason they have hopped over into 11:37 a.m. Showing them exactly how time is maintained, he reveals to them a new understanding of how the universe works: every minute is essentially a separate world which must be built, maintained, and torn down once it is over. The supervisor informs them that they cannot return for two reasons: 1) they cannot reveal to anyone the true nature of time and 2) the supervisor isn't even certain they could return if they wanted to. The Wrights flee from the foreman and his crew, and try to find a way to slip back to their own time. They hide inside a theater ticket booth and wait until 11:37 a.m. rolls around so they can catch up. The foreman finds them too late as the Wrights suddenly emerge into their own world again. Back in their own time, they find a blue wrench sitting on a public telephone which convinces them they had not dreamed their experience.

Some neo-Confederate organizations such as the League of the South continue to advocate the secession of the former Confederate States.  Etymology  = History of the term = Historian James M. McPherson used the term \\"neo- Confederate historical committees\\" in his description of the efforts which were undertaken from 1890 to 1930 to have history textbooks present a version of the American Civil War in which secession was not rebellion, the Confederacy did not fight for slavery, and the Confederate soldier was defeated by overwhelming numbers and resources.McPherson, James M. \\"Long- Legged Yankee Lies: The Southern Textbook Crusade,\\" from The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture, editors, Alice Fahs and Joan Waugh. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004)64-78. Reference to neo- Confederate on page 76. McPherson's discussion on page 68. Historian Nancy MacLean used the term \\"neo-Confederacy\\" in reference to groups, such as the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, that formed in the 1950s to oppose the Supreme Court of the United States rulings demanding racial integration, in particular Brown v. Board of Education (1954).MacLean, Nancy, \\"Neo- Confederacy against the New Deal: The Regional Romance of the Modern American Right,\\" paper presented at conference entitled \\"The End of Southern History? Reintegrating the Modern South and the Nation.\\" (Atlanta: Emory University, 2006). Former Southern Partisan editor and co-owner Richard Quinn used the term when he referred to Richard T. Hines, former Southern Partisan contributor and Ronald Reagan administration staffer, as being \\"among the first neo-Confederates to resist efforts by the infidels to take down the Confederate flag.\\"Quinn, Richard, \\"Partisan View,\\" Southern Partisan, 8.1 (1988);5. It is possibly the earliest use of the term \\"neo-Confederate\\" in Southern Partisan. This definition is not necessarily accepted by neo- Confederates, though Mel Bradford, who was a key figure in the neo-Confederate movement and a frequent writer for Southern Partisan from its founding, titled one of his books The Reactionary Imperative: Essays Literary and Political. An early use of the term came in 1954. In a book review, Leonard Levy (later a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1968) wrote: \\"Similar blindness to the moral issue of slavery, plus a resentment against the rise of the Negro and modern industrialism, resulted in the neo-Confederate interpretation of Phillips, Ramsdell and Owsley.\\"Levy, Leonard W. Review of Americans Interpret Their Civil War by Thomas J. Pressly. The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3. (Sep. 1954), pp. 523‚Äì524 Historian Gary W. Gallagher stated in an interview that neo-Confederates don't want to hear him when he talks \\"about how important maintaining racial control, white supremacy, was to the white South.\\"Butler, Clayton,\\"An Interview with Historian Gary Gallagher\\" https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/interview-historian-gary-gallagher He warns, however, that the term neo-Confederate can be overused, writing, \\"Any historian who argues that the Confederate people demonstrated robust devotion to their slave-based republic, possessed feelings of national community, and sacrificed more than any other segment of white society in United States history runs the risk of being labeled a neo- Confederate.\\"Introduction The Confederate War Gary W. Gallagher (Harvard University Press 1997)  Background  = Origins and doctrines of \\"Lost Cause\\" Civil War history = The \\"Lost Cause\\" is the name which is commonly given to a literary and intellectual movement that sought to reconcile the traditional society of the Southern United States with the defeat of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865.Gallagher, Gary W. and Nolan, Alan T. editors. The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History. (2000) p. 1. Gallagher wrote: :\\"The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives. They collectively sought to justify their own actions and allow themselves and other former Confederates to find something positive in all- encompassing failure. They also wanted to provide their children and future generations of white Southerners with a 'correct' narrative of the war.\\" Those who contributed to the movement tended to portray the Confederacy's cause as noble and most of the Confederacy's leaders as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry, defeated by the Union armies not through superior military skill, but by overwhelming force. They believe the commonly-portrayed Civil War history to be a \\"false history\\". They also tended to condemn Reconstruction and giving the vote to African Americans. On its main website, the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) speaks of \\"ensuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved\\", claiming that \\"[t]he preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South's decision to fight the Second American Revolution.\\" James M. McPherson has written on the origins of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), stating: \\"A principal motive of the UDC's founding was to counter this 'false history' which taught Southern children 'that their fathers were not only rebels but guilty of almost every crime enumerated in the Decalogue.'\\"McPherson pg. 98 Much of what the UDC called \\"false history\\" centered on the relationship between slavery and secession and the war. The chaplain of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), forerunner of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, wrote in 1898 that history books as written could lead Southern children to \\"think that we fought for slavery\\" and would \\"fasten upon the South the stigma of slavery and that we fought for it ... The Southern soldier will go down in history dishonored\\".McPherson pg. 97 Referring to a 1932 call by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to restore \\"the purity of our history\\", McPherson notes that the \\"quest for purity remains vital today, as any historian working in the field can testify.\\"McPherson pg. 106 In the 1910s, Mildred Rutherford, the historian general of the UDC, spearheaded the attack on schoolbooks that did not present the Lost Cause version of history. Rutherford assembled a \\"massive collection\\" which included \\"essay contests on the glory of the Ku Klux Klan and personal tributes to faithful slaves\\".Blight, David W. Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. (2001) pg 289 Historian David Blight concluded: \\"All UDC members and leaders were not as virulently racist as Rutherford, but all, in the name of a reconciled nation, participated in an enterprise that deeply influenced the white supremacist vision of Civil war memory.\\"Blight, David W. Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. (2001) pg. 290 Historian Alan T. Nolan refers to the Lost Cause as \\"a rationalization, a cover-up\\". After describing the devastation that was the consequence of the war for the South, Nolan states: > Leaders of such a catastrophe must account for themselves. Justification is > necessary. Those who followed their leaders into the catastrophe required > similar rationalization. Clement A. Evans, a Georgia veteran who at one time > commanded the United Confederate Veterans organization, said this: \\"If we > cannot justify the South in the act of Secession, we will go down in History > solely as a brave, impulsive but rash people who attempted in an illegal > manner to overthrow the Union of our Country.\\"Gallagher and Nolan pg. 13-14 Nolan further states his opinion of the racial basis of Lost Cause mythology: > The Lost Cause version of the war is a caricature, possible, among other > reasons, because of the false treatment of slavery and the black people. > This false treatment struck at the core of the truth of the war, unhinging > cause and effect, depriving the United States of any high purpose, and > removing African Americans from their true role as the issue of the war and > participants in the war, and characterizing them as historically irrelevant. Historian David Goldfield observes: > If history has defined the South, it has also trapped white southerners into > sometimes defending the indefensible, holding onto views generally > discredited in the rest of the civilized world and holding on the fiercer > because of that. The extreme sensitivity of some Southerners toward > criticism of their past (or present) reflects not only their deep attachment > to their perception of history but also to their misgivings, a feeling that > maybe they've fouled up somewhere and maybe the critics have > something.Goldfield, David. Still Fighting the Civil War: The American South > and Southern History. (2002) pg. 318 When asked about purported \\"neo-Confederate revisionism\\" and the people behind it, Arizona State University professor and Civil War historian Brooks D. Simpson said: > This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white > Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The > neo-Confederate movement's ideologues have grasped that if they control how > people remember the past, they'll control how people approach the present > and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and > heritage. It's a quest for legitimacy, the eternal quest for justification.  Tenets of neo-Confederate beliefs  = Historical revisionism = Neo- Confederates often hold iconoclastic views about the American Civil War and the Confederate States of America. Contrary to the views which are held by most Americans, neo-Confederates are openly critical of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln to varying degrees and they are also critical of the history of Reconstruction. Various authors have written critiques of Lincoln and the Union. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea is singled out for purported atrocities which neo-Confederates believe were committed against Southern civilians, in contrast to the mainstream historical perspective which argues that Sherman targeted Southern infrastructure and curtailed killing rather than expand it. Slavery is rarely mentioned‚Äîwhen it is, it is usually not defended and is denied as a primary cause of the Confederacy's starting of the American Civil War. Critics often accuse neo- Confederates of engaging in \\"historical revisionism\\" and acting as \\"apologists\\".http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=110 Lincoln Reconstructed Neo-Confederates have been accused of downplaying the role of slavery in triggering the Civil War and misrepresenting African- American support for the Confederacy. The book The Confederate and Neo- Confederate Reader says that toward the end of the 20th century‚Äîin order to support the idea that the Civil War was not about slavery‚Äîneo-Confederates began to claim that \\"thousands of African Americans had served in the Confederate army\\". A neo-Confederate publication, Confederate Veteran, published by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Military Order of the Stars and Bars, said in 1992 that \\"the overwhelming majority of blacks during the War Between the States supported and defended, with armed resistance, the Cause of Southern Independence\\".Loewen, James W. and Sebesta, Edward H., The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader, pp.17-19. Historian Bruce Levine says that \\"their [neo-Confederates'] insistent celebration these days of 'Black Confederates' ... seeks to legitimize the claim\\" that the war \\"had never [italics in original] been fought on behalf of slavery; loyalty to the South, Southern self-government, Southern culture, or states' rights ‚Äî rather than slavery and white supremacy ‚Äî fueled the Southern war effort\\".Levine (2006) p.13 The honor of the Confederacy and its veterans is another controversial feature of neo-Confederate dogma. The neo-Confederate movement is concerned about giving honor to the Confederacy itself, to the veterans of the Confederacy and Confederate veterans' cemeteries, to the various flags of the Confederacy and Southern cultural identity.http://vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com/2008/05/confederate- monumental-landscape_26.html Confederate Monumental Landscape: Literate Sources = Political beliefs = Political values held by neo-Confederates vary, but they often revolve around a belief in limited government, states' rights, the right of states to secede, and Southern nationalism‚Äîthat is, the belief that the people of the Southern United States are part of a distinct and unique civilization. Neo-Confederates are sometimes associated with the paleoconservative and libertarian movements because of shared views of the role of government. Neo-Confederates typically support a decentralized national government and are strong advocates of states' rights. Neo- Confederates are strongly in favor of the right of secession, claiming it is legal and thus openly advocate the secession of the Southern states and territories which comprised the old Confederate States of America. The League of the South, for example, promotes the \\"independence of the Southern people\\" from the \\"American empire\\". Most neo-Confederate groups do not seek violent revolution, but rather an orderly separation, such as was done in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Many neo-Confederate groups have prepared for what they view as a possible collapse of the federal United States into its 50 separate states much like the Soviet Union collapsed and believe the Confederacy can be resurrected at that time. Neo-Confederates are typically opposed to the civil rights movement, which they view as federal overreach. Historian Nancy MacLean states that neo-Confederates used the history of the Confederacy to justify their opposition to the civil rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s.MacLean (2010) p. 309 Historian David Blight writes that current neo-Confederates are \\"driven largely by the desire of current white supremacists to re-legitimize the Confederacy, while they tacitly reject the victories of the modern civil rights movement\\". = Cultural and religious = Neo-Confederates promote an unabashed Christian culture. They support public displays of Christianity, such as Ten Commandments monuments and displays of the Christian cross.http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cc.htm The Ten Commandments Some neo-Confederates view the Civil War as a conflict between a Christian South and a secular North.http://gis.depaul.edu/ehague/Articles/PUBLISHED%20CRAS%20ARTICLE.pdf \\"The US Civil War As A Theological War: Confederate Christian Nationalism and the League of the South,\\" in Canadian Review of American Studies, Vol. 32 No. 3, pp. 253-284. Certain neo-Confederates believe in an \\"Anglo-Celtic\\" identity theory for residents of the South.http://dixienet.org/New%20Site/faq.shtml Frequently Asked Questions about the League of the South = Economic policies = Neo-Confederates usually advocate a free market economy which engages in significantly less taxation than currently found in the United States and which does not revolve around fiat currencies such as the United States dollar.http://www.dixienet.org/New%20Site/corebeliefs.shtml League of the South Core Beliefs Statement Some of them desire an extreme type of laissez- faire economic system involving a minimal role for the state. Other Neo- Confederates believe in Distributionism as well as a display of populist tendencies since the Civil War. Figures such as Absolom West, Leonidas L. Polk, and William M. Lowe went on to join the Populist movements of their respective times. There is a minority of neo-Confederates who believe the Confederacy to have been Socialist citing the writings of George Fitzhugh and this was also displayed in Louise Biles Hill's book, State Socialism in the Confederate States. Many of which who believe such also point to Albert Parsons as another example.  Neo-Confederates and libertarianism  Historian Daniel Feller asserts that libertarian authors Thomas DiLorenzo, Charles Adams and Jeffrey Rogers Hummel have produced a \\"marriage of neo- Confederates and libertarianism\\". Feller writes: In a review of libertarian Thomas E. Woods, Jr.'s The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, in turn Hummel refers to the works by DiLorenzo and Adams as \\"amateurish neo- Confederate books\\". Of Woods, Hummel states that the two main neo-Confederate aspects of Woods' work are his emphasis on a legal right of secession while ignoring the moral right to secession and his failure to acknowledge the importance of slavery in the Civil War. Hummel writes: Hummel also criticizes Woods' \\"neo-Confederate sympathies\\" in his chapter on Reconstruction. Most egregious was his \\"apologia for the Black Codes adopted by the southern states immediately after the Civil War\\". Part of the problem was Woods' reliance on an earlier neo-Confederate work, Robert Selph Henry's 1938 book The Story of Reconstruction. Historian Gerald J. Prokopowicz mentioned apprehension toward recognizing Lincoln's role in freeing slaves as well as libertarian attitudes towards the Confederacy in an interview regarding his book Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln: Some intellectuals who have helped shape the modern neo-Confederate movement have been associated with libertarian organizations such as the Mises Institute. These individuals often insist on the South's right to secede and typically hold views in stark contrast to mainstream academia in regards to the causes and consequences of the American Civil War. Zack Beauchamp of ThinkProgress argues that because of its small size, the libertarian movement has become partially beholden to a neo-Confederate demographic. In contemporary politics, some libertarians have tried to distance themselves from neo-Confederate ideology while also critiquing President Lincoln's wartime policies, such as the suspension of habeas corpus, from a libertarian perspective.  Neo- Confederate views and the Republican Party  Historian Nancy MacLean writes that \\"since the 1960s the party of Lincoln has become the haven of neo- Confederacy. Having long prided itself on saving the Union, the Republican Party has become home to those who lionize the slaveholding South and romanticize the Jim Crow South\\". This embrace of neo-Confederate views is not exclusively about race, but it is related to a pragmatic political realization that the \\"retrospective romanticization of the Old South\\" and secession presented many possible themes that could be used as conservatives attempted to reverse the national changes initiated by the New Deal.MacLean (2010) pp. 308-309 After the defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election and the successes of the civil rights movement, national conservative leaders distanced themselves from racial issues, but they continued to support a \\"color-blind\\" version of neo-Confederatism. MacLean writes that \\"even into the twenty-first century mainstream conservative Republican politicians continued to associate themselves with issues, symbols, and organizations inspired by the neo-Confederate Right\\".MacLean (2010) pp. 320-321 Two prominent neo- Confederates‚ÄîWalter Donald Kennedy and Al Benson‚Äîpublished the book Red Republicans and Lincoln's Marxists: Marxism in the Civil War, in which they argue that Lincoln and the Republican Party were influenced by Marxism.  Criticism of neo-Confederates  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reports on the \\"neo-Confederate movement\\" almost always in a critical fashion. A special report by the SPLC's Mark Potok in their magazine, Intelligence Report, critically described a number of groups as \\"neo-Confederate\\" in 2000. \\"Lincoln Reconstructed\\", published in 2003 in the Intelligence Report, focuses on the resurgent demonization of Abraham Lincoln in the South. The article quotes the chaplain of the Sons of Confederate Veterans as giving an invocation which recalled \\"the last real Christian civilization on Earth\\". \\"Whitewashing the Confederacy\\" was a review that alleged that the film Gods and Generals presented a false, pro-Confederate view of history. Critics have accused the neo-Confederacy of being essentially a movement with racist undertones. Most prominently, the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Council of Conservative Citizens (formerly the White Citizens' Councils) have had this charge leveled against them.Southern Mercury, 2003-2008, 23 issues  Neo- Confederate groups  * Abbeville Institute * Council of Conservative Citizens * Flaggers (Confederate flag erectors) * Ku Klux Klan (1st and 3rd incarnations) * League of the South * Sons of Confederate Veterans * Southern Party (defunct) * United Daughters of the Confederacy  See also  * Anti- federalism * Alt-right * Culture of the Southern United States * Dixiecrat * Eugene Genovese * Jeffersonian democracy * Kinism * List of active separatist movements in North America * List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups * List of white nationalist organizations * List of Confederate monuments and memorials * Lost Cause of the Confederacy * Loy Mauch * Mel Bradford * Naming the American Civil War * Paleoconservatism * Paleolibertarianism * Politics of the Southern United States * Radical right * Richard M.

Plot Matthew awakens from a long sleep. His caretaker Sarah confirms he was put in cryogenic sleep in June 2023. Then she reveals he was asleep for more than 300 years... this is the year 2347. Sarah brings Matthew outside to see a small farm town, and he is confused as to why he was not brought to a city. She claims there are no more cities, freeways, or factories. Sarah takes him into what she calls the surgery area. Surgery is performed without need of anesthetic or instruments. She and two others use psychic abilities to take out the cause of the incurable disease that required him to be put into the cryogenic sleep. Matthew is overwhelmed after he sees the villagers can reach into his body and pull out the cancerous tissue painlessly. Although they are no longer technologically advanced, humans made progress in 300 years. In their world, technology is replaced by advances in human awareness and spiritual growth, the organic replaces the mechanical, and they live in balance and harmony with all life on the planet in what Sarah refers to as a \\"biological gestalt.\\" Matthew learns more about the agrarian post-apocalyptic community in which Sarah lives. Every need in this society is met through genetic engineering, psionics, or super-science in harmony with nature. However, Matthew wonders their reasons for waking him because he has no way of serving their agrarian society. They explain to him a meteor, sufficient to alter the entire ecosystem of Earth, is about to crash into the Indian subcontinent. His work with a satellite defense system from the past can help destroy the meteor. He becomes angry, however, after they say if it wasn't for this problem, he would still be asleep him out and uncured. They show Matthew what happened after he was put in sleep: In 2043, a nuclear exchange wiped out eighty-percent of the human population. The 200,000 survivors pledged to never trust machines again. Despondent, Matthew believes because he does not share the gifts of the others in the village, he will never belong to their community. Sarah comforts him, and tells him they can perform surgery on his brain and give him the same abilities they have. However, the meteor must be handled first. Matthew operates a salvaged personal computer used by the commune in an attempt to interface with the old satellite laser network. After the meteor makes a course correction upon reaching orbit, Matthew realizes it is not a meteor, but a United States spacecraft. Sarah reveals she used her psychic powers to fool Matthew, and explains her community is threatened by the instigators of the war who are returning to Earth. The spacecraft left Earth during the war they started to save their lives to perpetuate their power. The survivors have no defense, however. Violence and murder are not in their nature. She claims they did not want to trick him, but they knew he would not want to destroy the spaceship despite the fact the ship has weapons and would likely start the destructive war over again. Because of the \\"time dilation effect\\", time slowed for the ship‚Äôs crew and only a few years passed for them. Matthew does not believe Sarah, and he attempts to stop the weapon. Sarah thwarts his efforts by removing a piece of equipment from the computer. After the ship is destroyed, Matthew discovers there were indeed weapons aboard. However, he still feels like an outsider, and does not know his value to the community, especially since they tricked him into destroying the ship. Irene claims he is one of them now, and he learns to begin his psychic journey.

Most of the bay lies within Canada, with its western shore bounded by Washington County, Maine. The southernmost point is formed by West Quoddy Head on the U.S. mainland in Lubec, Maine; and runs northeasterly through Campobello Island, New Brunswick, engulfing Deer Island, New Brunswick, to the New Brunswick mainland head at L'Etete, New Brunswick in Charlotte County, New Brunswick.  Overview  Eastport and Passamaquoddy Bay, 1839, by William Henry Bartlett The exact demarcation of the border in Passamaquoddy Bay was a long-standing issue between the United States and Britain/Canada. Already the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, included a provision for the appointment of \\"commissioners to divide the islands of Passamaquoddy Bay between the United States and Great Britain\\" (see John Holmes). Nevertheless, confusions and ambiguities on this issue persisted. The southern boundaries of the bay are sometimes confused since Deer Island sections of the large open waters of the bay; however, the terminology of the Passamaquoddy Bay Treaty of 1910 specifies that Passamaquoddy Bay runs south of Treat Island (one of the islands that now comprise the city of Eastport, Maine), between Campobello Island and Lubec, Maine: > \\"Now, therefore, upon the evidence and arguments so presented, and after > taking into consideration all actions, of the respective Governments and of > their representatives authorized in that behalf and of the local governments > on either side of the line, whether prior or subsequent to such treaties and > award, tending to aid in the interpretation thereof, the High Contracting > Parties hereby agree that the location of the international boundary line > between the United States and the Dominion of Canada from a point in > Passamaquoddy Bay accurately defined in the Treaty between Great Britain and > the United States of April 11, 1908, as, lying between Treat Island and > Friar Head, and extending thence through Passamaquoddy Bay and to, the > middle of Grand Manan Channel, shall run in a series of seven connected > straight lines for the distances and in the directions as follows.\\" The largest community on Passamaquoddy Bay proper is St. Andrews, New Brunswick, but the twin communities of Calais-St. Stephen are sometimes included, despite being located on the St. Croix River. The city of Eastport, Maine lies between Passamaquoddy Bay and Cobscook Bay, to the city's west. The narrow passage between Maine and Deer Island is known as Western Passage. The passage between Eastport, Maine, and Friar Bay, Campobello Island, is known as Friar Roads. The three entrances into Passamaquoddy Bay from the Bay of Fundy are Letete Passage northeast of Deer Island, Head Harbour Passage to the southeast of Deer Island and northwest of Campobello Island, and Quoddy Narrows, between southern Lubec, Maine, and southern Campobello Island. Running north from West Quoddy Head in Lubec, the passages known as Quoddy Narrows, Lubec Channel, Lubec Narrows, Friar Roads, and Western Passage also host the International Boundary between Canada and the United States. The Head Harbour Passage is the deepwater entry to the Bay. The US and Canadian governments agree that the passage is Canadian. The US government believes that it is a territorial sea in which international law gives commercial vessels a right of passage. The Canadian government believes that it can regulate passage and is considering doing so to prevent the use by supertankers carrying cargo to liquified natural gas plants proposed for the American coast of the bay.  Smuggling  After the American Revolution, Passamaquoddy Bay was the scene of a thriving smuggling trade. Smuggling peaked in 1808 during Jefferson's Embargo, when smugglers illegally moved tens of thousands of barrels of American flour from American territory into New Brunswick. During the War of 1812, a thriving illicit trade in British manufactured goods existed. After the War of 1812, the primary smuggled good was gypsum from Nova Scotia, which was usually deposited directly into American vessels on or near the border. Smuggling was winked at by both officials and locals in the region, who discouraged outside intervention by British or American authorities who wanted to stop or control it.

Plot Dr. Joseph Fitzgerald, a Harvard University professor of history, has travelled back in time from the year 2172 and has assumed the identity of an instructor at Harvard, where he has now been teaching since 1961. In 1963, Fitzgerald is visited by Dr. Kate Wang, a colleague from his own time. They discuss his mission, which is to observe the assassination of John F. Kennedy, from whom he is descended. Fitzgerald is understandably nervous about watching his own ancestor be murdered, especially since he never got to know the man himself; he has met Kennedy only once. Wang reassures Fitzgerald that every field historian has moments of doubt such as this. When she departs for their home time, she says something that Fitzgerald does not quite catch. Fitzgerald journeys to Dealey Plaza in Dallas. However, when he glances up to the Texas School Book Depository and sees Lee Harvey Oswald raise a gun to kill Kennedy, Fitzgerald is unable to stand by and watch the killing. He intervenes and saves the president's life, shouting for the president and his entourage to take cover. Oswald fires anyway, but misses, and is later arrested by Dallas police. A grateful President Kennedy invites Fitzgerald to stay at the White House. As Kennedy and his entourage return home, the president is notified that Soviet troops have captured West Berlin. Fitzgerald is astonished, and claims that Khrushchev would never do such a thing. Kennedy sadly points out that Khrushchev was assassinated earlier that day. In his room that night, Fitzgerald frantically consults his time-travel wrist computer, which informs him that his alteration of history has caused massive rips in the fabric of time. The assassination of Khrushchev was not enough to \\"fix\\" the damage to the time stream; the computer informs Fitzgerald that all possible outcomes to this timeline will result in total war between the superpowers and \\"total extinction of biosphere\\". There is only one way to repair the timeline, the computer intones: \\"The Kennedy presidency must end, as history originally recorded it.\\" Meanwhile, the president and his chief Secret Service bodyguard, Ray, have grown suspicious of Fitzgerald after finding a half dollar coin with Kennedy's face on it (U.S. law states that no living person can be depicted on moneyhttps://www.ajc.com/news/national/this- the-reason-why-only-dead-people-can-featured-american- currency/Hy73VWnB84jjQzLmXrhHbP/.) which Fitzgerald dropped on Air Force One. They have also discovered that Fitzgerald's movie camera is not the standard model it appears to be. Metallurgists cannot open it up or determine what it may be. They summon Fitzgerald, who tells them that the camera is a holographic camera from the future, as he himself is. They are skeptical but are convinced of the truth when the professor demonstrates the camera's use. President Kennedy asks whether Fitzgerald was sent back in time to observe Kennedy's reaction to the Berlin crisis, but the professor replies that he did not know about that. Kennedy is puzzled at this, until he looks again at the coin and notices the date: 1964. Kennedy quickly deduces the truth: that Fitzgerald came to Dallas to witness an assassination, Kennedy's own. Kennedy volunteers to do whatever is necessary to repair history. Fitzgerald, overwhelmed by his ancestor's heroism, removes his Harvard school ring, which is actually his time travel device, and places it on Kennedy's hand. Kennedy vanishes, and Fitzgerald's computer reports that the president has been transported to Fitzgerald's home, in 2172. The professor tells Ray that a few changes need to be made; then, when looping back to Dallas and the motorcade, it is Fitzgerald who appears in the car and is shot and killed. At Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the dead body of \\"President Kennedy\\" (actually Fitzgerald) is being attended to by a doctor, who is actually Fitzgerald's colleague from the future. Ray, the Secret Service agent, recognizes her ring because it is identical to Fitzgerald's. She tells him that she knew what Fitzgerald's fate would be, saying, \\"Some of us do our research in the even farther future\\" and goes on to say, \\"The last time I saw him I couldn't tell him what I knew. All I could do was repeat a phrase\\"‚Äîthe remark that Fitzgerald didn't quite catch‚Äî\\"in Chinese that my husband taught me.\\" Holding Fitzgerald's hand tenderly, she repeats the phrase \\"Z√†iji√†n, l«éo p√©ngy«íu...z√†iji√†n. (ÂÜçË¶ãÔºåËÄÅÊúãÂèãÔºåÂÜçË¶ã); Goodbye, old friend...

At Harvard University in 2172, a man speaks to a classroom full of students, delivering a rousing speech in which he implicitly lauds Fitzgerald's sacrifice and the sacrifices of other honorable men like him. As the camera turns, we see that the speaker, dressed in clothing appropriate to the period, is John F. Kennedy.

The term was first used in 17th-century France, in reference to the management of household or domestic stock. Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to aristocratic or royal animal collections. The French-language Methodical Encyclopaedia of 1782 defines a menagerie as an \\"establishment of luxury and curiosity\\". Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across Europe and the Americas. Aristocratic menageries The Tower of London housed England's royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, British Library). A menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace. These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth, because exotic animals, alive and active, were less common, more difficult to acquire, and more expensive to maintain. The aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later zoological gardens since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest. =Medieval period and Renaissance= During the Middle Ages, several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts. An early example is that of the Emperor Charlemagne in the 8th century. His three menageries, at Aachen, Nijmegen and Ingelheim, located in present-day Netherlands and Germany, housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the Roman Empire, along with monkeys, lions, bears, camels, falcons, and many exotic birds. Charlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia.Fisher, James, Zoos of the World: The Story of Animals in Captivity, Aldus Book, London, 1966, p. 40. In 797, the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid, presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named Abul-Abbas. The pachyderm arrived on July 1, 802 to the Emperor's residence in Aachen. He died in June 810.Cardini, Franco, Europe and Islam, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, 2001, pp. 14‚Äì15. . William the Conqueror had a small royal menagerie. At his manor, Woodstock, he began a collection of exotic animals. Around the year 1100 his son, Henry I, enclosed Woodstock and enlarged the collection. At the beginning of the 12th century, Henry I of England is known to have kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, reportedly including lions, leopards, lynxes, camels, owls and a porcupine.Blunt, Wilfrid, The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century, Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15‚Äì17. . The most prominent animal collection in medieval England was the Tower Menagerie in London that began as early as 1204. It was established by King John, who reigned in England from 1199 to 1216 and is known to have held lions and bears. Henry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. The most spectacular arrivals in the early years were a white bear and an elephant, gifts from the kings of Norway and France in 1251 and in 1254 respectively. In 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, which was renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. This building was constituted by rows of cages with arched entrances, enclosed behind grilles. They were set in two storeys, and it appears that the animals used the upper cages during the day and were moved to the lower storey at night.O'Regan, Hannah, \\"From bear pit to zoo\\", British Archaeology, No. 68, December 2002, pp. 13‚Äì19. The menagerie was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. Animals recorded here at the end of the 18th century included lions, tigers, hyaenas and bears. Most of the animals were transferred in 1831 to the newly opened London Zoo at Regent's Park, which did not receive all the animals but rather shared them with Dublin Zoo.Mullan, Bob and Marvin, Garry, Zoo Culture: The Book about Watching People Watch Animals, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1987, p. 109. . The Tower Menagerie was finally closed in 1835, on the orders of the Duke of Wellington.\\"Big cats prowled London's tower\\", BBC News, October 24, 2005. The Tower Menagerie in London can be considered to have been the royal menagerie of England for six centuries. In the first half of the thirteenth century, Emperor Frederick II had three permanent menageries in Italy, at Melfi in Basilicata, at Lucera in Apulia and at Palermo in Sicily.Fisher, James, Zoos of the World: The Story of Animals in Captivity, Aldus Book, London, 1966, p. 41. In 1235, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II established at his court in southern Italy the \\"first great menagerie\\" in western Europe. An elephant, a white bear, a giraffe, a leopard, hyenas, lions, cheetahs, camels and monkeys were all exhibited; but the emperor was particularly interested in birds, and studied them sufficiently to write a number of authoritative books on them.Hoage, Robert J., Roskell, Anne and Mansour, Jane, \\"Menageries and Zoos to 1900\\", in New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century, Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, pp. 8‚Äì18. . By the end of the 15th century, the aristocracy of Renaissance Italy began to collect exotic animals at their residences on the outskirts of the cities. The role played by animals within the gardens of Italian villas expanded at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and one prominent example was the Villa Borghese built 1608‚Äì1628 in Rome.Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West, Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp. 43‚Äì46. . =Versailles and its legacy= The Pavilion constructed by Jean-Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey in 1759 at the Habsburg menagerie, the contemporary Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn. During the seventeenth century, exotic birds and small animals provided diverting ornaments for the court of France; lions and other large animals were kept primarily to be brought out for staged fights. The collecting grew and attained more permanent lodgings in the 1660s, when Louis XIV constructed two new menageries: one at Vincennes, next to a palace on the eastern edge of Paris, and a more elaborate one, which became a model for menageries throughout Europe, at Versailles, the site of a royal hunting lodge two hours (by carriage) west of Paris. Around 1661, he had a menagerie of \\"ferocious\\" beasts built at Vincennes for the organization of fights. Surrounding a rectangular courtyard, a two-storey building with balconies allowed spectators to view the scene. The animals were housed on the ground floor in cells bordering the courtyard, with small yards on the outside where they could take a bit of exercise. At Vincennes, lions, tigers, and leopards were kept in cages around an amphitheater where the king could entertain courtiers and visiting dignitaries with bloody battles. In 1682, for instance, the ambassador of Persia enjoyed the spectacle of a fight to the death between a royal tiger and an elephant. When the palace of Versailles was built, Louis XIV of France also erected a menagerie within the palace‚Äôs park. The menagerie at Versailles was to be something very different from the one at Vincennes. Most of it was constructed in 1664 when the first animals were introduced, although the interior fittings were not finished until 1668-70. Situated in the south-west of the park, it was Louis XIV‚Äôs first major project at Versailles and one of several pleasure houses that were gradually assembled around the palace.Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West, Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp.48-49. It represented the first menagerie according to Baroque style. The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout, in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion. Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages. Each enclosure had a house or stable at the far end for the animals and was bounded on three sides with walls. There were bars only in the direction of the pavilion.Strehlow, Harro, \\"Zoological Gardens of Western Europe\\", in Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens, Vernon N. Kisling (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, p.82. Animal fights were halted at Vincennes around 1700, the site fell into disuse, and the animals were installed at Versailles with the others. At about this time, the lions, leopards, and tigers from the menagerie at Vincennes were transferred to Versailles, where they were housed in newly built enclosures fronted with iron bars.Robbins, Louise E., Elephant Slaves and Pampered Parrots: Exotic Animals in Eighteenth-Century Paris, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2002, pp.37-67. This particular enterprise marked a decisive step in the creation of menageries of curiosities and was imitated to some extent throughout Europe after the late seventeenth century. Monarchs, princes and important lords built them in France (Chantilly from 1663), England (Kew, Osterley), the United Provinces (Het Loo from 1748), Portugal (Bel√©m in 1726, Queluz around 1780), Spain (Madrid in 1774) and Austria (Belvedere in 1716, Sch√∂nbrunn in 1752) as well in the Germanic lands following the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) and the ensuing reconstruction. Frederick William, Elector of Prussia, equipped Potsdam with a menagerie around 1680. The Elector of the Palatinate, the Prince Regent of Westphalia and many others followed suit.Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West, Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp.40-41. This design was adopted particularly by the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. In 1752 Francis I erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace near Vienna. Being at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in 1779. Initially, it was only open for \\"respectably dressed persons\\". Another aristocratic menagerie was founded in 1774 by Charles III of Spain on grounds which were part of the gardens of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. During two centuries, it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the Madrid Zoo Aquarium, moved in 1972 to the Casa de Campo.Historic Madrid: The Wild Animal House in the Retiro Park . In the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern zoological gardens with their scientific and educational approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn in Vienna, which was known officially as a \\"menagerie\\" until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and conservationist orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie. Travelling menageries In England travelling menageries had first appeared at around 1700. In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell's. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of Hannah Twynnoy in 1703 who was killed by a tiger in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Also in North America travelling menageries became even more popular during that time. The first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion, in Boston in 1710, followed a year later in the same city by a camel. A sailor arrived in Philadelphia in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.Hancocks, David, A different nature: The paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, pp.86-87. The first elephant was imported from India to America by a ship‚Äôs captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796. It was first displayed in New York City and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast.Kisling, Vernon N., \\"Zoological Gardens of the United States\\", in Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens, Vernon N. Kisling (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, pp.147-150. In 1834 James and William Howes‚Äô New York Menagerie toured New England with an elephant, a rhinoceros, a camel, two tigers, a polar bear, and several parrots and monkeys.Flint, Richard W., \\"American Showmen and European Dealers: Commerce in Wild Animals in Nineteeth Century\\", in New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century, Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.98. America‚Äôs touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the 1840s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the Civil War. Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war: The Van Amburgh menagerie travelled the United States for nearly forty years. Unlike their European counterparts, America‚Äôs menageries and circuses had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus advertised their shows as the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Greatest Menagerie‚Äù.

It differs from the original in that the characters Marsha meets are more menacing, and the tone of the episode is much heavier on suspense. The episode also differs in that rather than remembering what she is and accepting her fate as Marsha did in the original, the other mannequins force Marsha back into her true form so that another mannequin can take her place. Opening narration Note: This opening narration is only found in the original airing and not on the DVD release of the episode.https://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJ4VOO3FN28C Plot A sweet, naive young woman named Marsha frantically travels to the mall hoping it will still be open. A worker takes pity on her and lets her inside. As Marsha enters, a man begins following her but keeps his distance. She enters the only open store and asks for help. A female clerk pops up at the counter and Marsha tells her she is looking for a doll. After a moment, the clerk leaves to find it. Meanwhile, a little boy in a tuxedo with a toy spider then pops up, scares Marsha, and calls her by name. A lady in an evening gown joins the boy and apologizes for his rude behavior. She acts dismissively when Marsha asks how he knew her name. He, in turn, begs Marsha to take him with her when she goes. The clerk pops back up with the doll and Marsha pays for it. She then explains that she bought it out of gratitude for her landlord's kid, as her landlord found her a job, and let her rent her apartment for free even though she was broke. Suddenly, the man following her appears outside and the clerk starts aggressively asking for identification. Marsha tells the clerk her name and that she works for a local company. The clerk tells her that her history only goes back one month so inquires as to a longer timeline and asks where she was before then. Marsha runs away before giving an answer and the clerk follows. After getting on the elevator, Marsha discovers the same man from earlier following her. He raises his arms to reveal that his hands are those of a mannequin's. Marsha then runs out of the elevator followed by the lamentations of the mannequins. They find her and inform her that she is in fact a mannequin just like them. She runs away regardless but then slowly begins to transform: first her leg turns to plastic, then her arm. She still attempts to run but is frozen by the transformation as her other appendages turn to plastic as well. The mannequins tell her she has had her month to be a human and now it's someone else's turn. The next day, Marsha the mannequin is on display, while the mannequin she ran past the night before moves forward on her way to enjoy her turn as a human.

Various traces of human settlement were found dating to the Neolithic period. Digs were begun immediately, and lasted until 1896. The finds caused interest among archaeologists worldwide. They were largely responsible for the International Congress of Archaeology and Anthropology being held in Sarajevo in August 1894. The most impressive finds were the unique ceramics, which are now found in the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The culture disappeared during the Bronze Age. Settlements Members of Congress inspecting the Excavations at Butmir, 16 August 1894. Bottom: Flint and other objects found at Butmir. Main Butmir culture sites are: Butmir (Sarajevo), Kraljevine (Novi ≈†eher), Obre II (Kakanj), Nebo (Travnik), Crkvina (Turbe), Okoli≈°te, (Visoko), Brdo (Kiseljak) According to radiocarbon analysis, life in these settlements existed between 5100 and 4500 BCE. * Butmir I, 5100 ‚Äì 4900 BCE * Butmir II, 4850 ‚Äì 4750 BCE (settlement in Butmir, results from 1979), * Butmir III, to 4500. BCE (Gimbutas, 1974, 16) (results from 2002). The Butmir culture was the home for several large settlements, among them was the site of Okoli≈°te in Bosnia dating to 5200‚Äì4500 BC. with population estimates between 1,000‚Äì3,000 people. The settlement was largest in the early phase (5200 BC) with an area of 7.5 hectare, from there it gradually declined to reach the size of 1.2 hectare in 4500 BC. The site likely consisted of parallel rows of houses that ranged in size from four to ten meters in length. The site also likely had a series of ditches surrounding it with a single entrance. The site of Okoli≈°te would likely have been an egalitarian society with no evidence of social stratification. Most animal remains found in Okoli≈°te belong to cattle, while a fair amount belonged to sheep, goats, and pigs. The diet of the Okoliste people consisted mainly of cattle, emmer, einkorn, and lentils. Although there was an importance of agriculture and animal husbandry, wild game was still hunted as a source of food. Butmir is oldest Neolithic site in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was discovered by Austro-Hungarian authorities during the construction of school in district of Ilid≈æa. First field work was conducted between 1893. and 1896. Works were done by Vjenceslav Radimski and Franjo Fiala. This discovery was monumental, and sparked an international meeting of archaeologists and anthropologists in August 1894 in Sarajevo. Houses that were uncovered were in forms of dugouts (or semi-dugouts) and some above ground buildings. The largest number of dugouts was discovered in Butmir itself (90). Location in Kraljevine in Novi ≈†eher were explored in 1906‚Äì1908, but the results have not been fully published. Excavations unveiled large number of carved stone axes, which indicates a large workshop center but there is almost no Neolithic architecture. Obre near Kakanj were researched in 1963 to 1965, 1967 to 1968, and in 1970 when lage systematic excavations were done in two close locations: Obre I (Raskr≈°ƒáe) and Obre II (Gornje polje). Obre I belonged to Starcevo culture and Kakanj culture group, while Obre II completely belonged to Butmir culture. Main supplement of this neolithic economy were agriculture and animal husbandry. Hunting was of less importance, but also part of daily life. Pottery produced by these people shows they possessed fine workmanship. Decorations are unique to Butmir culture, and have many geometric motifs.  Pottery  alt= = Dishes = In the Butmir II phase, the diversity increased significantly. Conical bowls were a standard form of this phase, but there is emergence of conical bowls with a slightly curved upper part. This phase is also represented by oval, semi-lapid and biconical bowl shapes with less curved and shorter cylindrical necks, vases with legs and shallow coarse bowls with a wavy-shaped rims. A special group is pear-shaped vases with a small opening. The vast majority of ceramic products were simple, intended for storing food supplies, for holding water and for cooking. Only a small number are ceramics that represent a work of art. In terms of surface treatment and decoration of fine ceramic vessels, they can be divided into three groups: # Ceramics with dark gray or black gloss finish # Style with geometric motifs # Style with decorative motifs = Plastics = alt=At Butmir sites 72 human figures made of baked clay were found. They are made in such way so that one can easily identify some racial features. There are 3 main groups of found figures that showed racial characteristics of Negroid, Armenoid and European races. They are mainly female figures. Animal figures are very rare. See also *Bronze Age *Vinƒça culture References  Sources  * H.

Nyord covers an area of approximately 5 km¬≤, although only 1.2 km¬≤ is cultivatable moraine, while the remaining 4 km¬≤ is salt-meadow which is used for summer grazing, but is flooded during the winter. The island is reached by a narrow bridge from the larger island of M√∏n. The bridge was constructed in 1968 and replaced the post boat R√∏ret which had been in service since 1902. The boat was not large enough for animals such as cattle or horses, which had to swim alongside the boat. History Nyord (upper right) between M√∏n & Zealand. Traditionally the island has been self-sufficient, relying upon farming, fishing and piloting. Prior to 1769 the island belonged to the crown, but at this time crown lands were sold off, and the islanders purchased their own island for 3903 rigsdaler. The waters around the island are sufficiently treacherous that islanders could gain a livelihood as pilots, and this became enshrined in law as both a right and duty of the islanders between 1721 and 1879. After 1879 pilots were employed directly by the government instead of earning individual fees. A number of pilots houses and a lookout were constructed when the government took over the service. Piloting ceased in 1966. The village of Nyord remains similar to its original design, with traditional thatched cottages and farm houses. It has a church, museum and small harbour. There is a restaurant Lolles G√•rd which is both a farm and a restaurant, there also is a village shop. The marshland area crossed by the bridge from the main island has one of Denmark's most important habitats for geese, ducks and other wading birds.

Plot Harry Dobbs is a family man obsessed with surviving a nuclear war, and he has even built himself a fallout shelter in his basement. One afternoon, his wife Sally makes plans to visit her sister in Kansas City and to take their two kids with her. Harry and their son Jason are downstairs in the shelter teaching him to shoot a gun when Sally decides to leave. Harry and Sally argue about her leaving and him teaching a seven-year-old to shoot. He becomes frantic when he thinks Sally might have revealed the shelter's existence to her sister, as he wants it to remain secret. Nick, who runs Harry's gun and ammo store, comes by that evening and talks about the escalating tension in the Middle East. He is afraid that it could lead to nuclear war. They learn from the news that the President has left the White House to stay in an undisclosed location. Harry then talks about how he wishes the bomb would come so the world could be rid of pimps, cowards, rock stars, hair-dressers and bureaucrats (i.e. the scum of the world according to Harry). He talks about how he and his son would start over in a \\"purified\\" world (somehow leaving out his wife and daughter). While drunk, Harry reveals the existence of his shelter to Nick and shows him the whole operation while mentioning that nobody knows about it. Harry also shows Nick the fallout shelter's communications which includes a hydraulic system that can raise and lower an antenna through tons of rubble, so he could tentatively communicate with other survivors after a nuclear attack. Harry then turns on his communication system and raises its antenna while turning on the TV. On the news, Harry and Nick learn that World War III could be imminent. Harry frantically tries to get Sally to come home but she refuses saying that Harry \\"cries wolf\\" far too often. Without warning, a massive explosion occurs and Harry runs back to the shelter with Nick and shuts the door. The blast, however, destroys the raised antenna cutting off all information about what is happening outside. Believing that a nuclear weapon has hit the local air force base and that World War III has begun, Harry and Nick believe they are the only ones left alive. Six weeks later, Nick hears something moving above and Harry surmises it to be the walking dead or scavengers. Nick tries to get whatever is moving above to come down into the shelter and Harry goes ballistic. After ten months, the radiation has not gone down at all and Nick is going stir crazy. Harry decides to kill him but Nick leaves the shelter. After a while, Nick returns to tell Harry of what it is like outside. Everything is gone, there is no more daylight and it is freezing outside. Harry refuses to let Nick back in as he is afraid he'll contaminate him. Sometime after Nick dies, Harry's paranoia gets worse, and he prepares for battle in the event of outsiders attacking. Things are quite different from what Nick and Harry believed as the explosion was not a nuclear attack, but the result of a Broken Arrow incident in which a bomb accidentally detonated at the local Air Force base destroying the entire town. The accident actually shocked the world from the brink of war. The blast crater has been contained under a radiation proof dome memorial - The Peace Dome - which has sealed the debris and radiation inside of it and proved to the world the folly of war. The memorial was built on top of the Dobbs' house. The episode ends when Sally and the kids place flower on the memorial. Jason asks Sally if that's where his daddy is buried and she says yes and smiles, knowing he is basically buried alive.

History  =World War II= Trathen was named after Lieutenant Commander James Trathen, commander of USS Midnight (1861) during the American Civil War. She was laid down on 17 March 1942 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 22 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Cassin Young, wife of Captain Cassin Young who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor as commanding officer of Vestal (AR-4) during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; and commissioned on 28 May 1943, Commander Alvoord J. Greenacre in command. 1943 Following training operations in the Hawaiian area, Trathen joined Rear Admiral Willis A. \\"Ching\\" Lee's Task Force (TF) 11 to take part in the reoccupation of Baker Island. The target isle, a tiny elliptical speck of land, lay nearer to the Japanese-held northern Gilbert Islands than Funafuti in the Ellice group and presented a valuable staging area for projected aerial search and photo reconnaissance missions against the Japanese mandates. Lee, in Hercules (AK-41), led TF 11's sortie from Pearl Harbor on 25 August 1943, and his ships arrived off Baker on 1 September. While the transports and Ashland (LSD-1) disembarked their troops and disgorged their cargoes shoreward, Trathen stood by and provided fighter-direction services to the Grumman F6F Hellcats from Belleau Wood (CVL-24) and Princeton (CVL-23). During the action, the destroyer directed the F6F's to a radar contact 32 miles away. They soon came upon the snooping Kawanishi H8K (Allied identifier: \\"Emily\\") flying boat and dispatched her so fast that no radio report from the Japanese got out over the airwaves. Two days later, Trathen again vectored the Hellcats to another \\"Emily\\" which they also splashed into the sea. With Baker secure and the priceless airfield constructed and ready for use by 11 September, Trathen headed for Hawaii. On 29 September, the ship commenced screening operations for Task Group (TG) 14.5, as it sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for Wake Island. Under the command of Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, this fast carrier task force‚Äîthe largest yet assembled‚Äîconsisted of Essex (CV-9), Yorktown (CV-10), Lexington (CV-16), Cowpens (CVL-25), Independence (CVL-22), and Belleau Wood. On 5 and 6 October, Montgomery's planes made six strikes, flying 738 combat sorties while battleships and cruisers provided their heavy gunfire for further harassment of the Japanese- held island. Despite a cracked high-pressure turbine casing, Trathen retired with the task force back toward the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 11th. Temporary patching at Pearl Harbor permitted the destroyer to proceed to Bremerton, Washington, and permanent repairs at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. The ship sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 21 November and reached Pearl Harbor six days later. Following training exercises with land-based aircraft off Oahu, Trathen's commanding officer was designated Commander, Task Unit (TU) 16.15.2, and his ship joined Martin (DE-30) and SS Mormacport. The ships sailed via Canton Island, Funafuti, and Tarawa to Makin Island where they arrived on 18 December. The next day, the destroyer sped 125 miles to the scene of a downed PBY Catalina, rescued the patrol bomber's crew, and returned to Makin on the 20th. On the return leg of the mission, the ship's radar picked up a formation of Japanese medium bombers bound for the Gilberts. Evidently attracted to bigger game, the bombers sped on. However, one which passed over the ship was taken under fire but apparently suffered no damage. After pressing on to Abemama Island, Trathen and Le Hardy (DE-20) got underway on Christmas Day 1943 to escort SS Mormacport back to Hawaii. One day out, an \\"Emily\\" spotted the three-ship convoy but stayed tantalizingly out of reach of the Allied ships' guns. Detaching Le Hardy that evening, Trathen and Mormacport proceeded on to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on New Year's Day 1944. 1944 Trathen conducted gunnery exercises in the Hawaiian area before departing Pearl Harbor on 23 January, bound for the Marshalls. Entering Kwajalein lagoon on 2 February, Trathen relieved Schroeder (DD-501) off Kwajalein Island as a fire-support ship and shelled Japanese positions ashore until the fire control party could locate no further targets. On the 5th, Trathen joined McCord (DD-534) and cruisers Minneapolis (CA-36) and San Francisco (CA-38) off Gugegwe delivering support fire for the three battalions of marines, embarked in six LST's, as they swarmed ashore in LVT(A)'s and 17 amphtracs, with 16 M4 Sherman tanks. At 0720, Trathen commenced fire with her main battery, sending 5-inch shells whistling shoreward. The destroyer and her consorts then stood by as the landing craft reached the beach. Trathen continued to provide gunfire support until the Kwajalein operations ended on 7 February. The destroyer headed for Majuro on the 8th and arrived there the next day. On the 10th, Trathen returned to Kwajalein to conduct antisubmarine patrols. Trathen next formed up with Indianapolis (CA-35) off Eniwetok. Based on an intelligence report that the island was unoccupied, the American warships carried out relatively light bombardment. In the meantime, analysis of papers captured at Kwajalein revealed that Eniwetok was, in fact, defended by tough, crack Japanese troops. Too late for a radical change of plans, Indianapolis and near-sister Portland (CA-33), accompanied by Trathen and Hoel (DD-533), stationed themselves on the flanks of the LCI(G)'s, with waves of LVT's in the middle. Trathen screened the former cruiser while Hoel drew the latter, and the ships joined the gunboats (LCI(G)) in firing on the island. Eniwetok soon fell to the mailed fist of American land and sea power. Trathen furnished fire support intermittently until the 29th of the month and thereafter remained at Eniwetok until 4 March when she headed for Majuro for a tender availability. Then, following exercises at Purvis Bay in the Solomon Islands and patrol duty between the Emirau and New Hanover Islands, Trathen subsequently joined the 7th Fleet on 3 May. The destroyer departed Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, on 15 May in company with TF 74 and 75, bound for New Guinea waters. The target island, Wakde‚Äîoccupied in 1942 by the Japanese‚Äîpossessed an excellent airstrip and vital facilities which would be immensely useful to the Allies as they \\"island-hopped\\" closer to the Philippines and Japan. Arriving on the 17th, Trathen provided gunfire support for the force which landed on Wakde and later operated off the coast supporting the operation until the 25th, when the ship sailed for Biak Island. The next target on the Navy's timetable, this island‚Äîthe largest of the Schouten Islands group‚Äîlay fringed with coral reefs. The attack force scheduled to bombard the island arrived off the landing beaches 15 minutes ahead of schedule; and, at 0629 on the morning of 27 May, the 6-inch guns of cruisers Phoenix (CL-46), Boise (CL-47), and Nashville (CL-43) began lobbing the first of 1,000 rounds of shells shoreward, while the destroyers looked for \\"game\\" along the landing beaches‚Äîsuch as small Japanese patrol craft. At 1100, four Japanese fighters made half-hearted passes over the airstrips on Biak. Two fighter-bombers came over late in the afternoon shortly thereafter followed by four twin-engined planes‚Äîthree of which were destroyed by antiaircraft fire. The fourth was damaged. Trathen remained on patrol station off the Schoetens until 31 May, when she retired to Humboldt Bay to rejoin TF 75. The Japanese' first reinforcement attempt towards Biak had been detected, and the Nipponese had turned back. On 3 June, as the enemy was retreating, TF 74 and 75 received orders to go after the fleeing Japanese. At 23:18 on 3 June, Trathen got underway with the other units of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 48 and gave chase. The next day, 10 Japanese Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers tried to pounce on the American force but were driven off. On the 5th, Japanese torpedo bombers attacked American forces, and one of them fell to Trathen's heavy antiaircraft fire. Subsequently, the enemy launched a second effort aimed at reinforcing their beleaguered outpost on Biak. Six Japanese destroyers‚Äîthree with troops embarked and three towing landing barges‚Äîjoined cruisers Aoba and Kinu north of Misool Island, west of the \\"parrot beak\\" of New Guinea. The enemy force was under Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju in destroyer Shikinami. Proceeding towards Biak, the Japanese reinforcement group remained undetected until 10 B-25 Mitchells, escorted by P-38 Lightnings, spotted them and launched a devastating attack which sank Harusame and damaged three of her sister destroyers. Resuming the run to Biak once the planes had departed, the Japanese continued on an unknowing collision course with Vice Admiral V.A.C. Crutchley's cruisers and destroyers prowling between Biak and Hollandia. Unaware of Sakonju's position, Crutchley decided to commence a sweep parallel to the coast of Biak. About 2200 on the night of 8 June, a PB4Y bomber on night patrol, detected the Nipponese force and reported five unidentified ships making 12 knots in the direction of Crutchley's cruisers and destroyers. Deploying for battle on a northerly course, the British Admiral ordered his ships to general quarters. The Japanese simultaneously detected the American's presence and turned to fire torpedo spreads before retiring. Trathen, in DesDiv 48, followed astern of DesDivs 42 and 47, under orders from Crutchley to pursue the fleeing enemy. Then, while the two divisions charged ahead on the heels of the retreating Nipponese, Trathen and her division mates fell back on orders to screen Crutchley's cruisers. The American force never caught up with the enemy and returned to Humboldt Bay on the following day. Trathen subsequently participated in the invasion of Noemfoor Island. Assigned to TG 77.2, the covering force, she conducted shore bombardment missions there on 2 July before retiring to Humboldt Bay. She later served in the covering forces during the landings at Cape Sansapor, New Guinea, on 30 July, laying smoke screens and patrolling 25 miles off shoreline to cover the invasion. Recreation and availability at Sydney, Australia, from 13‚Äì20 August, provided Trathen's officers and men with a welcome respite from the toils of war. Heading back north after a week of Australian hospitality, the destroyer conducted exercises and drills in the vicinity of Purvis Bay in preparation for the Western Carolines Operation. On 6 September, she departed from Purvis Bay as part of TG 32.5. After screening the carriers as they launched devastating air strikes in support of the Palau invasion, the destroyer retired on 26 September to refuel and replenish depleted ammunition stocks in Kossol Passage. With the dissolution of her task, the destroyer headed for Manus and arrived there on 2 October. Next assigned to TG 77.4, Trathen set her course towards Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. Landings on Dinagat and Suluan Islands in the entrance to Leyte Gulf commenced on the 17th; and the destroyer stood by to provide antiaircraft and gunfire support. Three days later, three Japanese fighters roared low over the area which Trathen was guarding. Within minutes, the ship's gunners splashed their second plane of the war; and the destroyer even managed to capture the aircraft's pilot whom they transferred to carrier Sangamon (CVE-26). Again on the 24th, Japanese aircraft harassed the ships of the invasion force, and the alert combat air patrol (CAP) downed two more of the enemy. Trathen retired to Manus early in November but returned to Leyte Gulf on the 16th for patrols in Surigao Strait. Relieving Sigourney (DD-643) on the 19th, Trathen remained in the Philippines until the 23d when she headed to the Western Carolines. After sinking a medium barge with 5-inch and 40-millimeter fire en route, she reached Ulithi on 25 November. Exercises off Ulithi occupied the ship from 30 November to 29 December before Trathen joined TG 38.2 on 5 January 1945. She served as plane guard and screening vessel for this group and TG 38.5 through the end of the month. The former group participated in preinvasion strikes on the island of Luzon before turning to the South China Sea for a series of strikes on Japanese-held Taiwan from 9 to 11 January. The French Indochina coast next received its share of attention, with Japanese shipping and coastal installations feeling the might of the American naval air arm. Then, moving northward against virtually no opposition from Japanese planes or ships, the task group aircraft bombed Hong Kong and Hainan Island. Monsoon and typhoon- type winds and seas buffeted the group on the 17th and 18th, with Trathen's inclinometer registering a staggering 67 degrees from the vertical at the height of the storm. 1945 After leaving the South China Sea through the Balintang Channel, Trathen and her mates participated in more strikes against Taiwan and in raids on Sakishima Gunto which served Japan as a staging area for the kamikazes. In the course of her plane-guarding duties, Trathen steamed astern of Hancock (CV-19) on 21 January and witnessed the detonation of a Grumman TBF Avenger as it landed hard on the flight deck. One man was blown overboard by the explosion, but Trathen soon fished him from the water. Following the strikes on Okinawa, Trathen got underway from Ulithi on 10 February to support carrier operations between Iwo Jima and the Japanese home islands. Six days later, TF 58 commenced the first strikes against Tokyo launched from 150 miles south east of the Imperial city. After a night retirement, the group conducted further strikes the next day. With the landings at Iwo Jima, Trathen arrived in the vicinity on the 20th and screened the carriers as they conducted air strikes for the next four days supporting the American marines fighting for that fanatically defended island. The force swept north with Trathen in its screen and arrived at a point off Tokyo at dawn on the 25th to launch strikes to hit the Japanese capital again. That night, the carriers steamed in the direction of Nagoya, but heavy weather cancelled the strikes scheduled to be launched against that industrial city on the 26th. While in Japanese waters, Trathen and her division mates sighted a number of floating mines. The destroyer herself sank one with gun fire on 27 February. Following availability at Ulithi, Trathen returned to the \\"front lines\\" on 14 March, rendezvousing with TG 58.4 in preparations for air strikes on the Japanese home islands and on Okinawa. Temporarily detached to pick up a downed pilot, the destroyer rejoined the group as it plowed on towards Japan. She later sank several more floating mines while screening the carriers against air attacks. Slashing through CAP and antiaircraft fire, some kamikazes managed to crash into their targets and give their lives for the Emperor. Antiaircraft fire from Trathen's group accounted for five of the winged marauders, but one hit Intrepid (CV-11) on 18 March. Nine days later, Trathen, in company with battle cruisers Guam (CB-2) and Alaska (CB-1), cruisers Flint (CL-97) and San Diego (CL-53) and four other destroyers left the carriers to bombard Minamidait≈çjima. All ships shelled the target area with impunity. The battlecruisers, light cruisers, and destroyers rejoined the carriers on 28 March and resumed their screening duties. In the months that followed, American forces‚Äîaided by the small British Far East Fleet‚Äîcontinued hammering at the Japanese homeland with air strikes and bombardments by surface ships. On 11 April, still attached to TF 58, Trathen hammered away at attacking Japanese planes with her antiaircraft batteries. During the third raid that day, a 5-inch shell from a \\"friendly\\" ship hit the destroyer near her number five 5-inch mount handling room. It killed three men, wounded 21, and rendered the after mount inoperative. Tender availability soon made good the damage, and Trathen returned to the Fleet. Departing Ulithi on 3 May, she rejoined TF 58 on the 5th near Okinawa. Six days later, Bunker Hill (CV-17), flagship of TF 58, was hit by a kamikaze. Another Japanese pilot, with similar intentions for Trathen, dived toward the destroyer. While the ship's guns hammered at the suicide plane, help came from the air. A \\"friendly\\" fighter, braving the antiaircraft fire from his own ships, also attacked the kamikaze which crashed into the sea off Trathen's port bow. Anchoring in Ulithi lagoon for a needed rest, Trathen got underway again 10 days later and sortied with TG 58.4 to screen the carrier. On 4 June, air operations were cancelled as the barometer began to plummet. The storm center of a typhoon passed some 70 miles to the southeast, and the ships in company with Trathen emerged unscathed from the fringes of the storm. On 6 June, while carrying out plane-guard duties, the destroyer rescued the two-man crew of a downed SB2C Helldiver. She recovered both men, but the pilot was dead when he was brought on board. These operations proved to be Trathen's last of World War II, for she soon departed Leyte to begin the long voyage back to the United States. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, Trathen arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 9 July 1945, for an overhaul at the Todd Shipbuilding Co. While the destroyer was in the shipyard, the war in the Pacific ended. Upon completion of the refit, the ship sailed for San Diego on 29 September and arrived there on 2 October. On 18 January 1946, Trathen was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. = Post-World War II = When North Korean forces swept southward across the 38th parallel on 25 June 1950, the United States soon came to the aid of the embattled South Koreans. Called out of reserve service on 14 June 1951, Trathen was recommissioned on 1 August. As flagship of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 28, the ship was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 5 October, based at Norfolk, Virginia, and operated off the east coast and in the Caribbean through the end of 1952. Trathen at sea on 3 September 1952. Subsequently ordered to the Far East, Trathen arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 12 February 1953. During her Korean deployment, Trathen's main and secondary batteries pounded railroad lines, trains, bunkers, and transformer stations. On 11 March, the destroyer joined the \\"Train Buster Club\\" when she destroyed a railroad train. Two days later, after the ship completed her patrols between Wonsan and Hungnam, she was relieved on station to return to Sasebo for repairs. Later becoming a part of TF 77, Trathen continued on duty until 7 June. She departed Sasebo on the following day, bound for Hong Kong. Returning to the United States via Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean, Trathen operated with the Atlantic Fleet until January 1955, when she was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet and subsequently deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac). On 21 April, Trathen departed Long Beach, California to begin successive WestPac deployments which would last through 1964, interspersed with tours of duty on the west coast. When in the Orient, she followed a varied itinerary visiting such ports as Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; as well as Pearl Harbor, Guam, Midway, and Subic Bay. During this period, she took part in antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and other exercises; served as plane guard when operating with fast carrier forces, and patrolled the Taiwan Strait as part of American forces protecting that island. While Trathen was at Kaohsiung during her last deployment to WestPac, word arrived early in August of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. Getting underway shortly thereafter, Trathen operated at sea throughout the remainder of the month but for brief replenishments at Kaohsiung. Relieved on station, Trathen sailed for Hong Kong to serve as station ship before traveling to the South China Sea to support naval operations off the coast of the Republic of Vietnam. On 8 October 1964, the destroyer departed for eastern waters and proceeded via Guam and Midway to the west coast. = Fate = After arriving at Long Beach on 28 October, the destroyer conducted routine carrier operations off the west coast. On 12 February 1965, Trathen reported to the Commander, San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, to begin her second inactivation period at the Todd Shipyard, San Pedro, California. On 15 March, she made her final voyage at the end of a towline. Brought to San Diego, she completed the process of deactivation and was decommissioned on 11 May 1965 and placed in reserve. A survey of the ship conducted in June 1972 reported that the costs of modernization to Trathen would be disproportionate to the value of the ship. Accordingly, Trathen was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1972 and scrapped.  Honors  Trathen received eight battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean War service.

Life and work =Early career= Oviedo was born in poverty in the town of Juan de Mena (Cordillera Department) on September 23, 1943. He chose a military career, studied in Germany and eventually became a close aide to General Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez. He was named chief of the Army in 1993. When President Juan Carlos Wasmosy asked him to step down from that position in April 1996, he allegedly refused and threatened a coup d'etat. After days of tension, Wasmosy offered him the Defence Ministry instead, but when Oviedo went to the presidential palace to take the oath, dressed in civilian clothes, the President, backed by popular demonstrations, withdrew the offer. Ousted from the military, he concentrated in winning the ruling Colorado Party's candidacy for the 1998 presidential elections, and succeeded by presenting a populist platform through his great rhetorical skills. A month before the national elections, and while leading the polls, he was finally condemned to a ten-year prison term for his 1996 military mutiny. His running mate Ra√∫l Cubas continued the campaign and eventually won the elections, largely based on the promise to free Oviedo, which in fact he did days after taking office, over the protest of the Paraguayan Supreme Court and opposition leaders. In March 1999, vice president Luis Mar√≠a Arga√±a, a key political enemy of both Oviedo and President Cubas, was assassinated. In the midst of riots and political turmoil known as Marzo paraguayo (\\"Paraguayan March\\"), Cubas resigned, abandoning Oviedo, who fled into exile, first in Argentina and then in Brazil. =Imprisonment and release (2004-2007)= On June 28, 2004, he returned to Paraguay and was detained by the police, who took him to the Military Prison of Vi√±as Cu√©, located a short distance from Asunci√≥n. Initially sentenced to a ten-year term, he was released on parole for good behaviour on 6 September 2007.\\"Paraguay's Oviedo leaves prison\\", BBC News, 6 September 2007.

ASP addresses substandard housing using volunteer labor to perform repairs to make homes \\"warmer, safer, and drier.\\" ASP operates in Central Appalachia, specifically in the states of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The mission statement of ASP is \\"Appalachia Service Project is a Christian ministry, open to all people, that inspires hope and service through volunteer home repair in Central Appalachia,\\" and ASP's vision is that \\"substandard housing in Central Appalachia will be eradicated and that everyone who comes into contact with this ministry will be transformed.\\" Repairs are made using volunteer labor and at no cost to the homeowner. Between 1969 and 2015, ASP hosted 377,412 volunteers and performed repairs on 17,373 homes.http://asphome.org History ASP was founded in 1969 by Rev. Glenn \\"Tex\\" Evans, who emphasized the importance of providing service to those in need \\"right where they are, just the way they are.\\" While working as a director at Henderson Settlement in Frakes, Kentucky, Evans saw first hand the need for assistance in home repairs among his neighbors. Later when he became a staff member of the Board Of Discipleship of the United Methodist Church in Nashville TN, he took several weeks off from his preaching schedule to recruit 50 teens and their adult counselors to repair four homes in Barbourville, Kentucky. This initiative has evolved into the Appalachia Service Project, which currently mobilizes between 15,000 and 17,000 volunteers each year to provide repairs to more than 500 families.[1] ASP continued to grow between 1969 and 1976 by sponsoring regional workshops across the country to educate volunteers about the Appalachian region, bringing ASP's volunteers together to discuss their experiences and discuss replication of ASP's home repair model in their home communities. As an outgrowth of this vision, ASP expanded its work outside of the Central Appalachian region during the summer of 1976, sponsoring work crews in Arkansas, California, Alabama, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Kentucky. Although ASP returned to its Central Appalachian roots the following summer, the Sierra Service Project in California became a successful spin-off and still exists today. Programs =Summer Program= Throughout the summer, ASP hosts volunteers aged 14 years and up. More than 14,000 youth, college, and adult volunteer groups come to Central Appalachian Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia to perform home repairs during the months of June and July. Volunteer groups perform a week a service and are housed in one of ASP's 26 \\"summer centers\\", often schools or community centers that have been leased by ASP. ASP staff provide direction for home repair projects and supply tools, construction materials, and three meals each day. =Year-Round Program= In 1980, ASP established the first of its permanent facilities, the Jonesville Housing Services Center in Lee County, VA. Prior to the development of this property, ASP had operated as a summer program only. The Housing Services Center, however, established a year-round home rehabilitation program in Jonesville, VA, available to low-income homeowners and advised by a council of local residents. Follow a 1989 capital campaign, ASP acquired and renovated a second housing services center in Chavies, KY to serve residents of Perry County throughout the year. The third year-round center, located in Brenton, WV was acquired in 1996, when the Wyoming County school board offered ASP permanent use of the former Guyan Valley Elementary School facility. ASP continues to host volunteers for a week or shorter periods of time throughout the year at these permanent facilities. Volunteers who participate in the year-round program are matched with projects to suit their skills and level of construction experience. Although year-round centers welcome youth volunteers, the program focus is geared more specifically to adult and college-aged groups, and evening programming is not required for all groups. Moreover, volunteers with the year-round program stay in facilities that are climate-controlled and offer amenities such as bunk beds and indoor showers. The operations of the Year-Round Program are supervised by ASP's \\"Fellows\\". The ASP Fellowship was first established through a donation from the Lily Endowment, and includes seminars and activities designed to facilitate the process of vocational discernment. During their year of service, ASP's Fellows live in and immerse themselves in the community they work alongside, in addition to supervising and guiding work groups through their assigned construction projects. =College Service Project (CSP)= ASP's founder, Tex Evans, always said: \\"We'd love for all ASP volunteers to come back each summer, but if they don't because they have started this in their own community, we'd love that even more.\\" CSP chapters use ASP's model for home repair to plan and complete projects in their own community. CSP was launched in September, 2014 and 12 Campus Chapters are currently in operation. These chapters are student-run, student-led organizations on college campuses that are nationally affiliated with ASP. The mission statement of CSP is \\"College Service Project inspires students to lives of Christian service and leadership through home repair for low-income families in Central Appalachia and back in their home communities.\\" Students involved with CSP also volunteer with ASP and carry out a trip to one of ASP's Year Round centers during the fall, winter, or spring; fundraise and gain community sponsorship in order to raise the funds necessary to complete their projects; and recruit volunteers from within their community as well as potential applicants for ASP's Summer Staff program. Furthermore, members of CSP chapters are encouraged to serve with their communities in other ways that promote social justice and are compatible with the guiding principles of ASP. In addition, CSP provides college students with the opportunity to develop professional skills outside of a classroom setting. The various activities performed by CSP chapters provide students with hands-on experience in construction management, community development, marketing, grant writing, fundraising, recruitment, and volunteer management. =Long-Term Recovery Program= Launched in response to flooding in the Dry Creek and Cash Hollow communities of Washington County, Tennessee in August 2012,http://opportunitylives.com/the-appalachia-service- projects-many-hands-building-homes-and-hope-in-rural-appalacia/ ASP operates a disaster recovery program designed to assist low-income families in the Central Appalachian region rebuild following disasters such as fires or floods. Following the June 23, 2016 floods in West Virginia, ASP launched the Rebuilding Rainelle initiative to assist families in Rainelle, WV and surrounding towns. This program, which has been implemented by ASP in partnership with Homes for White Suphur Springs, the St. Bernard Project, and Neighbors Loving Neighbors completed the first new home for a flood survivor in West Virginia on November 22, 2016.http://www.register- herald.com/news/appalachia-service-project-is-rebuilding- rainelle/article_ecd8e1ba-ed95-5b71-bf19-f5f83ba7ae4a.html ASP expects to complete 60 new homes for flood survivors and will continue work through 2017. =New Build Appalachia= ASP began constructing new homes in 1985 to help those in Central Appalachia achieve decent, safe, and sanitary housing and to complement the home repair ministry. Since that time, 201 new homes have been built in primarily Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky. Although the program was temporarily suspended during the 2000s due to operating deficits, the program was relaunched following the success of the new build program developed in the aftermath of the Dry Creek floods. ASP's New Build Appalachia program provides mortgage-free new homes to families in East Tennessee and has constructed 22 new homes since 2014. The recipients of these homes are typically low-income families whose homes are beyond repair.http://wjhl.com/2017/02/24/appalachia- service-project-aims-to-build-a-dozen-new-free-homes-in-2017/ =Race to Build= Race to Build is an annual event hosted by ASP in partnership with the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. During the Spring Race in 2016, volunteers from as far north as Washington, D.C., down to Tri Cities, Tennessee, came together to build a home for a veteran, his wife, and two adopted children at the speedway. Volunteers were challenged to push the limits of how quickly it would be possible to build a house. In just one week, the house was completely built and furnished, and was dedicated on the morning of the Food City 500.http://www.heraldcourier.com/news/local/asp-volunteers- race-to-build-home-for-local-family- on/article_f71bed75-0344-5587-b2c6-f5c44da34b23.html After construction was completed, the home was moved to a permanent location for the family. Looking to the future, ASP will continue to partner with the Bristol Motor Speedway to create spin-offs of this event. In spring of 2017, three colleges will compete to build a house as quickly as they can in just 3 ¬Ω days. They will be measured on speed, accuracy, safety, and other factors, and the winning college will bring home a scholarship and claims to first place.

Opening narration Plot Thomas Barton is an astronaut who must deliver a vital cargo of vaccine to a plague-stricken colony world. However, a young girl named Marilyn has stowed away on his vessel with hopes of reuniting with her brother Gerry at the colony. Now the entire mission is in jeopardy as her presence on board was not calculated into the flight plan, which goes strictly \\"by the numbers\\" and there will be no way for the pilot to compensate for her added weight. They also discover that there are no other ships which can pick her up prior to arrival at their destination. While she is distraught that she will never see Gerry again, and because their ship is on a crash course, they attempt to compensate by jettisoning all possible extra weight. They discover, however, that the extra weight jettisoned is only half of what they need to make it to the colony planet. Barton suggests that the girl try to contact her brother so they could at least talk before the impending doom. She finally contacts him in time, but only to talk about how they cannot meet in person. Barton considers sacrificing himself so the girl can survive, but finds this is impossible since she would not be able to pilot the ship herself.

Charles August Albert Dellschau (4 June 1830 Brandenburg, Prussia - 20 April 1923 Houston, Texas) was one of America's earliest known visionary artists, who created drawings, collages and watercolors of airplanes and airships and bound them in 12 known large scrapbooks that were discovered decades after his death. Life Little is known about Charles Dellschau's life. Primary sources are scarce and secondary sources often contain contradictory information. It is known that he emigrated from Brandenburg, Prussia to Texas in 1850, where he worked as a butcher. In 1860, Dellschau received his letter of citizenship in Fort Bend County, and in 1861 he married Antonia Hilt, the widow of Pierre Hilt, who already had a daughter from her previous marriage. Charles Dellschau's marriage to Antonia took place in Richmond, Texas., and at some point after the marriage, Charles started working as a sales clerk in his in-laws' saddlery shop. In addition to his stepdaughter, Dellschau had three children: two daughters, Bertha and Mary, and a son, Edward, who died in 1877 at age 6. Dellschau's wife, Antonia, died in the same year, leaving her husband a widower at age 47. In 1865 Dellschau signed the Civil War Amnesty Oath, indicating that he was a soldier for the Confederate States Army. In this document Charles Dellschau is described as a fair complexioned man of 5'3\\" with auburn hair and hazel eyes. After his retirement in 1899, he lived with his stepdaughter and her husband, and worked in their attic apartment in Houston, Texas, where he filled at least 13 notebooks with drawings, watercolor paintings, and collages depicting fantastical airships. He died at the age of 93, and was buried in the Washington cemetery in Houston in Stelzig Plot A-70. On his grave marker, the last name is misspelled as \\"Dellschaw,\\" probably as a result of the \\"u\\" being written with an elongated tail on his death certificate. His grave marker also lists his initials on as C. A. instead of C. A. A. Posthumous recognition After his death, Dellschau's home remained in the hands of his descendants. His notebooks of paintings and drawings, as well as his diaries were left virtually untouched for half a century until the late 1960s. Following a fire, the house was cleared and at least 12 of the notebooks were placed on the sidewalk to be discarded. Fred Washington, a local antiques and used furniture dealer, spotted the books, and for $100 bought them from the trash collector. The books sat undisturbed in Washington's store under a pile of discarded carpet for over a year. In 1968, Mary Jane Victor, an art student at the University of St. Thomas in Houston stumbled upon the notebooks, and persuaded Washington to lend some of them to the university for a display on the story of flight. She also brought them to the attention of art patron and collector Dominique de Menil. Mrs. de Menil purchased four of the notebooks for $1,500. Of the remaining books, seven were purchased by Peter (Pete) G. Navarro, a Houston commercial artist and UFO researcher. After studying them, Navarro sold four of the notebooks to the Witte Museum in San Antonio, and the San Antonio Museum of Art. One notebook ultimately ended in the private abcd (art brut connaissance & diffusion) collection in Paris belonging to Bruno Decharme, a French filmmaker and art collector. The rest of the notebooks ended up in private hands. Some were dismantled and single pages were sold. In 2016, a double sided page dated 1919, sold for $22,500 at Christie's. Dellschau's earliest known work is a diary dated 1899, and the last is an 80-page book dated 1921-1922, giving his career as an artist a 21-year span. His work was in large part a record of the activities of the \\"Sonora Aero Club,\\" of which he was a purported member. Dellschau's writings describe the club as a secret group of flight enthusiasts who met in Sonora, California in the mid-19th century. According to Dellschau, one of the club members discovered a formula for an anti-gravity fuel called \\"NB Gas.\\" The club mission was to design and build the first navigable aircraft using the NB Gas for lift and propulsion. Dellschau called these flying machines Aeros. Dellschau never claimed to be a pilot or a designer of any of the airships; he identifies himself only as a draftsman for the Sonora Aero Club. His collages incorporate newspaper clippings (called \\"press blooms\\") of then-current news articles about aeronautical advances and disasters.The Secrets of Dellschau: The Sonora Aero Club & The Airships of the 1800s Despite exhaustive research, including searches of census records, voting rosters, and death records, nothing has been found to substantiate the existence of this group except for a few gravestones in the Columbia Cemetery where several of the surnames are found. It is speculated that, like the voluminous \\"Realms of the Unreal\\" notebooks by outsider artist Henry Darger (1882-1973), the Sonora Aero Club is a fiction by Dellschau. However, according to UFO writer Pete Navarro, a coded story is hidden throughout the drawings, which he interprets to mean that the Sonora Aero Club was a branch of a larger secret society known only as NYMZA who developed advanced aeronautic techniques decades earlier than is commonly believed.http://www.blogtalkradio.com/oopa-loopa-cafe/2009/10/23/dennis- crenshaw-secrets-of-dellschau Dellschau's first one-person exhibition \\"Charles Dellschau - Aeronautical notebooks\\" and its accompanying catalogue was held in 2000 at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New York City, some 75 years after his death. Witte (which mounted an exhibition of Dellschau and Da Vinci called \\"Flights of the Imagination\\") and the San Antonio Museum (which curated a solo exhibition of Dellschau entitled \\"Flight or Fancy? The Secret Life of Charles A. A. Dellschau\\", also shown at the Menillo Museum in Florida) and the Menil Collection. Dellschau's artwork is also in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum, the abcd Art Brut collection in Paris, which owns an entire book, the High Museum in Atlanta, the American Folk Art Museum in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the John Michael Kohler Art Center, and several prominent private collections in America and Europe. Several Dellschau drawings were put on display at the Museum of Everything, London England in 2009 as well as in Turin in 2010. The American Visionary Museum in Baltimore has shown the work of Dellschau on several occasions and the INTUIT Museum in Chicago presented a one-person exhibition of Dellschau's art in September 2012. Charles Dellschau's life and art is the subject of a monograph released in the spring of 2013 produced by Marquand Books, Stephen Romano and distributed by Distributed Art Publishers with essays by Thomas McEvilley, Tracy Baker-White, Roger Cardinal, James Brett, Thomas Crouch, Barbara Safarova and Randall Morris. The book has been reviewed in Raw Vision magazine by Tom Patterson, as well as in Bookforum, and Intuit magazine. Critical analysis Dellschau is regarded as one of America's earliest visionary artists. His work has been interpreted as a testimony to the sense of optimism that new technologies inspire as they change the way people see the world. Flight, up until that time, had been a metaphor for man's pathos - or his inability to accomplish what he was not meant to. Dellschau's work is also remarkable in that it uses the medium of watercolor brilliantly, often using water as the medium with a subtle tint of color. Dellschau's work shows the influence of circus banner painting, in its use of centralized subjects and ornamental borders, and often possesses a jewel-like quality. Reviewing the 1998 Ricco Maresca exhibition, the New York Times said: The book The Secrets of Dellschau by Dennis Crenshaw and Pete Navarro tells the story of Dellschau and of the secrets the authors argue that Dellschau hid within his artwork. Pete Navarro spent 27 years studying Dellschau's drawings and writings. According to Navarro, the story of the Sonora Aero Club and their achievements had been cleverly hidden by Dellschau in his drawings using several codes and unconnected sentences hidden throughout the work. Thus, one would have to see ALL of the Dellschaus to understand the narrative.

The university was established on February 27, 1990 at Nong Chok District, Bangkok. as Mahanakorn College by Prof. Dr. Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom, former Dean of King Mongkut‚Äôs Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. The objective was to train engineering students in response to the severe shortage of engineers. MUT was then promoted to full university status under the new name Mahanakorn University of Technology .It is the first and still the only university in the country that operates its own low-orbit microsatellite (TMSAT). Faculties There are four faculties, * Engineering, * Information Science and Technology, * Veterinary Medicine and * Business Administration. Doctoral and master's degree programs are offered in addition to bachelor's degree courses. The main campus of the university is located in Nong chok District, Bangkok. Another campus is located at Vanit2 Building on New Petchaburi Road, Central Bangkok. Overseas cooperation Cooperation with oversea universities has played an important role in the development of MUT. Partnerships has been established with: * Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, * The University of New South Wales, Australia, * University of Sydney, Australia, * Imperial College London, England, * The University of Surrey, England, * Coventry University, England, * University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, Germany. MUT and Imperial College (London, England) has jointly established an electronic circuit design laboratory in Imperial College. The centre was opened by Her Royal Highness Princess Royal, daughter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is a research centre for Thai doctoral students and a gateway for Thai industry to access advances in Microelectronics. Notable activities MUT has designed and constructed a microsatellite. The satellite was built in the University of Surrey by a team of MUT engineers and launched in March 1998. The satellite was named ‚ÄúThai Paht‚Äù by His Majesty King Bhumibol. It is controlled from the ground station on the Nong Chok campus. The station has opened educational centre for communication engineering students and a research centre in satellite engineering. Images downloaded from the satellites are used in the study of regional and environmental features. A program of further satellite construction is underway in cooperation with Chinese and Korean satellite research institutes. Mahanakorn has established itself as notable research centre nationally and worldwide. MUT staffs have published the largest number of articles among Thai academics in international engineering journals. Several projects have also been recognized for their contribution to society such as mine detector, unmanned aerial vehicle and water filer. International and national recognitions MUT was ranked 36th by Asia Week Magazine in category of Asian Best Science and Technology Institution within ten years after it was founded. MUT‚Äôs latest achievement is to accomplish a score of 4.86 out of 5 which is the highest score in the category of Research University in an assessment by the office for National Education Standards and Quality Assessment (ONESQA), a public organization set up to assess the performance of all educational institutions from schools to universities, in two categories: research and learning qualities and the quality of graduates.Mahanakorn tops uni poll References External links * Mahanakorn University of Technology Category:Private universities and colleges in Thailand Category:Universities and colleges in Bangkok Category:Science and technology in Thailand Category:Educational institutions established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Thailand Category:Universities in Thailand ","title":"Mahanakorn University of Technology"},{"id":"860408","text":"\\"To See the Invisible Man\\" is the second segment of the sixteenth episode from the first season (1985‚Äì86) of the television series The Twilight Zone. Opening narration Plot Mitchell Chaplin lives in a world parallel to ours. A rude and obnoxious man, Chaplin has been found guilty of \\"coldness\\"‚Äîof not being friendly or open enough with those around him. According to the State, he is to be rendered \\"invisible\\" and a social outcast for one year. An implant placed on his forehead warns others not to interact with him in any way lest they be punished in a like manner. Chaplin laughs at the verdict and his \\"punishment\\". On the first day of his punishment, he continues his obnoxious behavior in a cafeteria, grabbing whatever food he pleases and knocking off the chef hat of an employee, knowing that no one would retaliate. Mitchell does, however, quickly shy away when a little boy asks him a question, not wanting to get the child in trouble. What seems like a welcome chance to be left alone becomes a lesson in humility, compassion, and empathy as Chaplin begins to feel the consequences of social isolation. Under the omnipresent eye of floating security drones that monitor their society, people shun him, even a woman who is also sentenced to be invisible. At a dining hall, a blind hobo sits next to Mitchell who laments he cannot afford much, and Mitchell kindly shares some of his food with the man. The friendly conversation is refreshing for Mitchell, until a waitress whispers a warning to the hobo that he is interacting with an invisible man. The blind man furiously curses Chaplin and turns away. Misfortune after misfortune befalls Chaplin; even an attempt to hide his implant with a hat is thwarted. Chaplin's nadir is reached when some drunken men hit him with their car, laughing they \\"never saw\\" an invisible man. When Mitchell calls a hospital, the nurse is unable to help him as his invisibility stops him from registering on a picture phone. Finally, on the last day of his sentence two silent policemen come to his residence. Using the same device that rendered him invisible, it removes the implant on his head. Acknowledging his presence for the first time, they address him as Mr. Chaplin and invite him to have a drink with them; they remind him, though with intimidating looks, that this is this world's way of welcoming an invisible man back into their society. Chaplin prudently complies. Four months after completing his sentence, Chaplin is accosted in public by a young woman (whom he encountered during his term of invisibility) who wears the scar of an implant. Knowing the law, he initially ignores her but her cries move him to hug her. As they are surrounded by drones warning him to separate from her and move on, he declares that he can see the woman and that he cares about her suffering. Closing narration Note This episode is based on the short story by Robert Silverberg first published in Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963. In the original short story, the criminal is never named, and his one-year sentence was noted to begin on May 11, 2104. In addition, the gender of the criminal's friend was changed from a man in the original story to a woman in the televised version.

Plot On an interstellar journey in the future, a medical doctor and a priest debate the existence of God in the wonders of the universe. Dr. Chandler (Donald Moffat) believes the universe to be random, but Father Matthew Costigan (Fritz Weaver), who's also an astrophysicist, believes in God's grand but ineffable design. During their friendly debate, their spaceship picks up a subspace signal from a long-dead world. Father Matthew claims it is impossible that a civilization could have survived its star going supernova. Upon landing on the now-dead planet, the explorers discover that it holds the last remains of a race which was destroyed when the supernova's blast hit. Their civilization was quite advanced, and they find remnants of art and other pieces of their culture. A computer record shows that they had one thousand years of peace before their extinction. Father Matthew determines the star went supernova in the year 3120 B.C. To his dismay, Father Matthew realizes that it would have taken 3,120 years for the light from this explosion to reach Earth in the Eastern Hemisphere, causing the starlight that shone down on Earth the day Jesus was born, \\"The Star of Bethlehem\\". Father Matthew's faith is deeply shaken, exclaiming that it is unfair that such a star should have exploded near a world that was harboring life. Dr. Chandler attempts to comfort him by translating a poem he found among the archives of the dead culture. It says that no one should mourn for them, for they lived in peace and saw the beauty of the universe. It says to grieve for those who live in pain and those who never see the light of peace. Dr. Chandler says that whatever destiny was theirs, they fulfilled it and passed their light onto another world. The doctor's words and this artifact consoles and encourages the priest.

With the help of Amanda Strickland, a local, he methodically goes through the town looking for a cure. Amanda's father rambles about his dead wife and that Mrs. Hotchkiss had visited him earlier that morning. They visit her and find that she appears normal, but suddenly she tries to kill them with a knife. Amanda suggests that it may be a disease, since it is spread from person to person. He eventually discovers that the source of the problem is not a physical disease but an idea‚Äî-a short, secret phrase-‚Äîthat is being passed by word of mouth from person to person. The phrase is about the purpose and meaning of existence. It was somehow discovered by a local resident, Jeffrey Potts, while he was traveling abroad; his brother Andrew was the first victim of the word-disease. Jeffrey is compelled by a desire to share this insanity-inducing phrase with others, and visits the local radio station to tell the entire town the secret. Sayers cannot make it to the station to stop the disclosure, but he is able to reach Amanda in time to smash her radio.

He was regarded as a top first five-eighth, having played first for Canterbury in 1993, before being selected for the All Blacks (New Zealand's national team) in 1995 when he played in the 1995 World Cup. After his move to England, and later to France, he helped his first three clubs to promotion into their country's top flight. He first joined Harlequins in England, where in his first season he played a major factor in leading the freshly relegated club to an immediate return to the top-level Guinness Premiership. After seeing Harlequins successfully through their first season back in the Premiership, he went to the ambitious Pro D2 club Toulon for the 2007‚Äì08 season. After Toulon won the title to secure an immediate return to the Top 14, he remained in Pro D2, moving to another ambitious side, Racing M√©tro. For the second straight season, his team won the Pro D2 crown and a spot in the Top 14. Youth Mehrtens' parents lived in South Africa for four years from 1970 and returned to New Zealand when he was still a young child. Mehrtens grew up in Christchurch, attended Christchurch Boys' High School, and played Junior Grade Rugby for Kaiapoi. He also represented New Zealand at under-19 and under-21 levels. Like many players in New Zealand, Mehrtens comes from a family with a long involvement in rugby. His grandfather, George Mehrtens, played for Canterbury in the 1920s as a fullback and was an All Black in unofficial internationals against New South Wales in 1928. His father, Terry, also a first five, represented Canterbury between 1964 and 1976. He was a New Zealand under-23 player in 1965 against the Springboks and again in 1967, and while in South Africa played as a fullback for against the 1970 All Blacks. Career New Zealand rugby has had few players who have won such wide popularity and affection as Andrew Mehrtens, who in a 12-year career at first class level became a national figure rather than simply an icon of his Canterbury province. However, there was never total agreement on his ranking in the pecking order of All Black first five-eighths. Some headed by Colin Meads believed that Mehrtens was the best in his position ever produced by New Zealand. Others believed that despite his immense skills, vision, kicking and ability to throw long cut out passes to his outsides he had limitations, especially in the way rugby developed in the professional era. He was seen as lacking the physique or inclination to mix it physically, either taking the ball up or committing himself to the tackle. Outside the playing field, Mehrtens proved to be a favourite with fans and a large section of the media because of his pleasant manner, his intelligence, and his wit and sense of humour. Despite his family background Mehrtens only emerged as a rare prospect in his late teens, perhaps because he was a slower developer physically. In his teens Mehrtens showed almost as much promise in tennis, where in various age groups he was nationally ranked. His first significant rugby selection was in 1992 when he played in the national under 19s against Australia in a side which also included later Crusaders or All Blacks teammates Adrian Cashmore, Norman Berryman, Milton Going, Tabai Matson, Justin Marshall and Taine Randell. He was first chosen for Canterbury in 1993‚Äì94 and in each of those seasons he was in the New Zealand Colts, making his first major impact nationally in the Canterbury side which in 1994 took the Ranfurly Shield from Waikato. His performance that day and in Shield defences later that season against Counties and Otago marked him as a clear All Black prospect. Though left out of the initial training squads, Mehrtens developed so much that he forced his way into the 1995 World Cup squad, having made his All Black debut in the early season test against Canada when he scored 28 points. In the World Cup tournament he was a success, one of three youngsters with Jonah Lomu and Josh Kronfeld who gave the All Blacks a dimension which had been lacking for much of the 1994 season. The only quibble about Mehrtens at the World Cup was missing a dropped goal attempt in the extra time of the final. Over the next six or seven seasons Mehrtens was a virtual automatic selection for the All Black squad, though he was not always assured of a starting position. A knee injury curtailed his 1995 tour of France and in the next few seasons injury and competition from the likes of Carlos Spencer and Tony Brown saw him miss a number of tests. But he reasserted himself during the 1999 season, both in kicking a record nine penalties in a trans-Tasman test against Australia at Eden Park and then at the World Cup. However, an injury in the quarter-final against Scotland clearly affected him in the latter rounds. Besides his importance to the All Blacks, Mehrtens from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s fashioned an outstanding record for the Crusaders at Super 12 level. He had key roles in their three title wins in 1998‚Äì2000, either through his tactical command of games or, as in the 2000 final against the Brumbies, with a penalty goal under severe pressure. He also played in the Crusaders sides which won the Super 12 titles of 2002 and 2005, even though in the final season he was now playing second fiddle to his protege Daniel Carter. Mehrtens was also a huge contributor to Canterbury at National Provincial Championship (NPC) levels, with his inside back partnership with half-back Justin Marshall becoming celebrated. As well as 1994 against Waikato he played in Shield winning sides in 2000 (against Waikato again) and in 2004 against Bay of Plenty. He played in three NPC winning sides in 1997, 2001 and 2004. Over the latter stages, especially in 2003, Mehrtens was beset by personal problems which in turn affected his fitness and form. He battled to make the Crusaders then and in 2004 and was left out of the All Blacks for the 2003 season, though many believed he should have been recalled for the World Cup. He eventually did win his All Black place back for a brief period in 2004, but by then it had become clear that the immediate future belonged to Carter. At the end of the 2005 Super 12, Mehrtens left New Zealand rugby to play for the Harlequins in Britain. He left behind a formidable record: 281 first class games for 3,178 points, 108 games for Canterbury for 1,056 points, 87 for the Crusaders and 981 points, 72 games for the All Blacks and 967 points in 70 tests. His test aggregate, a record for a New Zealander until Dan Carter surpassed it in November 2009, would have been greater, and well into four figures, had he not missed many of the \\"softer\\" tests played during his time in the All Blacks. His understudies ‚Äì Simon Culhane, Spencer and Brown ‚Äì all scored heavily in his absence from these matches. =International= Mehrtens debuted for the All Blacks in 1995 and made an immediate impact, scoring 28 points against Canada in his Test debut; at that time, that was the highest point total ever by a player making his international debut. He also featured in the team that played in the 1995 Rugby World Cup final against South Africa and came within inches of claiming victory for New Zealand, with a drop goal attempt veering just wide of the posts at the end of regulation time. Mehrtens is currently the second all-time points scorer for the All Blacks, with 967 points (7t, 169c, 188p, 10dg), having been overtaken by Dan Carter on 21 November 2009. He has scored 20 or more points in 13 separate Tests, has scored nine penalties in two separate Tests, and is currently the only player to have scored over 300 points in the Tri Nations Series. His 209 points against South Africa is the most ever by one player against one country; he also occupies third place on that list, with 202 against Australia. (Carter is currently second with 207 points against Australia.) Mehrtens is also atop the all-time list for Test conversions, with 167. A supposed drop in form, combined with injuries, saw him miss out on the All Blacks World Cup squad in 2003. Critics of coach John Mitchell felt New Zealand's chances were dealt a blow without the choice of an experienced goal-kicker, an area in which New Zealand could not compete in the semi-final against Australia. Nonetheless, a strong 2004 Super 12 campaign saw him called back to the All Blacks. He was also not included in the 2005 All Black squad to face the British and Irish Lions. =Domestic= In Super 12, Mehrtens was a key member of the dominant Crusaders side that won the competition four times in five years (1998, 1999, 2000, 2002), and in 2005, another successful year for the Crusaders, he also played well, making regular appearances off the bench and starting in a few games. During 2005 he became the competition's leading all-time scorer, a crown he held until 9 May 2009, when the Brumbies' Stirling Mortlock passed his record of 990 points. He was also on three NPC-winning Canterbury sides, in 1997, 2001 and 2004. Mehrtens is credited with reestablishing the Canterbury region as a force in New Zealand rugby again after nine years in the wilderness when in 1994 he generaled a young team who won the Ranfurly Shield off Waikato. Since that time Canterbury and under his stewardship won numerous NPC championships listed above together with rewinning the Ranfurly Shield in 2000. He won his way into the team having displaced Greg Coffey in the Canterbury A team. =Post All Blacks= Mehrtens played his final match for Harlequins on the final day of the 2006‚Äì07 season which fell on his birthday, scoring 24 points in a victory over the Sale Sharks, after which supporters and teammates celebrated his birthday and bid farewell to him after the game ended. On 23 May 2007, Mehrtens joined French Pro D2 team Toulon, who went on to win the league title that season and gain promotion to the Top 14. For the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Mehrtens signed to play with French Pro D2 team Racing M√©tro 92. After two years in Paris, which included the 2009 Pro D2 championship and a Top 14 playoff appearance in 2010 (which also secured Racing a place in the 2010‚Äì11 Heineken Cup), his contract was not renewed. He moved to the F√©d√©rale 1 (third-division) side B√©ziers, signing a three-year deal with the club. Under his contract, Mehrtens has the option to move into the club's coaching staff once he decides to end his playing career. In 2014 he joined the Waratahs as a kicking coach. Honours In the 2006 New Year Honours, Mehrtens was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.

Prostrate shrub is a related term. \\"Subshrub\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"bush\\".Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth & Co. London, 4th ed 1928 Because the criteria are matters of degree rather than of kind, the definition of a subshrub is not sharply distinguishable from that of a shrub; examples of reasons for describing plants as subshrubs include ground-hugging stems or low growth habit. Subshrubs may be largely herbaceous, with overwintering perennial woody growth much lower-growing than deciduous summer growth. Some plants described as subshrubs are only weakly woody and some persist for only for a few years; others however, such as Oldenburgia paradoxa live indefinitely, rooted in rocky cracks. Small, low shrubs such as lavender, periwinkle, and thyme, and many members of the family Ericaceae, such as cranberries and small species of Erica, are often classed as subshrubs. Definition A chamaephyte or dwarf- shrub is a plant that bears hibernating buds on persistent shoots near the ground ‚Äì usually woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the ground, usually less than above soil surface. The significance of the closeness to the ground is that the buds remain within the soil surface layer and are thus somewhat protected from various adverse influences. Accordingly, the chamaephyte habit is especially common in stressful environments, for example: * ecosystems on nutrient-poor soils or rock * exposed alpine or arctic ecosystems where seasonal or perennial wind and freezing conditions are prone to kill growing shoots * ecosystems subject to frequent burning, where many species of e.g. Banksia or Eucalyptus regrow from a lignotuber or caudex. * heavily grazed or overgrazed ecosystems, such as tortoise turf Examples of chamaephytes The term chamaephyte is most formally used within the context of Raunki√¶r plant life-forms. Examples of chamaephytes are many of the species of the maquis and other plants of submediterranean dry ecosystems (species such as thyme, Thymus vulgaris, and rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis); others include heather species (e.g. Calluna vulgaris and Ericas), African wild olive (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) and edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum).

The Key System consisted of local streetcar and bus lines in the East Bay, and commuter rail and bus lines connecting the East Bay to San Francisco by a ferry pier on San Francisco Bay, later via the lower deck of the Bay Bridge. At its height during the 1940s, the Key System had over of track. The local streetcars were discontinued in 1948 and the commuter trains to San Francisco were discontinued in 1958. The Key System's territory is today served by BART and AC Transit bus service. History =Early years= A San Francisco, Oakland & San Jose Railway carriage Key Pier, 1909 The new ferry terminal on the Key System Mole in 1933. The old ferry terminal and the end of the mole had been destroyed by a fire and explosion earlier in the year. The system was a consolidation of several streetcar lines assembled in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Francis Marion \\"Borax\\" Smith, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in Borax and earned his nickname, \\"Borax\\", and then turned to real estate and electric traction. The Key System began as the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway (SFOSJR), incorporated in 1902. Service began on October 26, 1903, with a four-car train carrying 250 passengers, departing downtown Berkeley for the ferry pier. Before the end of 1903, the general manager of the SFOSJR devised the idea of using a stylized map on which the system's routes resembled an old-fashioned key, with three \\"handle loops\\" that covered the cities of Berkeley, Piedmont (initially, \\"Claremont\\" shared the Piedmont loop) and Oakland, and a \\"shaft\\" in the form of the Key pier, the \\"teeth\\" representing the ferry berths at the end of the pier. The company touted its 'key route', which led to the adoption of the name \\"Key System\\".The Key Route, Harre Demoro, v.1, p.12, publ. Interurban Press (1985) In 1908, the SFOSJR changed its name to the San Francisco, Oakland & San Jose Consolidated Railway, changed to the San Francisco-Oakland Terminal Railway in 1912. This went bankrupt in December 1923 and was re-organized as the Key System Transit Co., transforming a marketing buzzword into the name of the company. A Key System train in Emeryville, 1909, heading west to the Mole, entering the underpass (\\"subway\\") under the mainline of the Southern Pacific under construction. Following the Great Crash of 1929, a holding company called the Railway Equipment & Realty Co. was created, with the subsidiary Key System Ltd running the commuter trains. In 1938, the name became the Key System. During World War II, the Key System built and operated the Shipyard Railway between a transfer station in Emeryville and the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond. =National City Lines era= National City Lines acquired 64% of the stock in the system in 1946. The same year E. Jay Quinby hand published a document exposing the ownership of National City Lines (General Motors, Firestone Tire, and Phillips Petroleum). He addressed the publication to The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass- Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community. In it he wrote \\"This is an urgent warning to each and every one of you that there is a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities‚Äìyour Electric Railway System\\". The new owners made a number of rapid changes. In 1946 they cut back the A-1 train route and then the express trains in 1947. The company increased fares in 1946 and then in both January and November 1947. During the period there were many complaints of overcrowding. On April 9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals (constituting officers and directors of certain of the corporate defendants) were indicted in the Federal District Court of Southern California on two counts: 'conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopoly' and 'Conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines'. They were convicted of conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies. They were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. In 1948 they proposed a plan to convert all the streetcars to buses. They placed an advertisement in the local papers explaining their plan to 'modernize' and 'motorize' Line 14. Oakland city council opposed the plan by 5‚Äì3. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) supported the plan which included large fare increases. In October 1948, 700 people signed a petition with the PUC \\"against the Key System, seeking restoration of the bus service on the #70 Chabot Bus line\\". The councils of Oakland, Berkeley and San Leandro opposed the removal of street cars. The traffic planners supported removal of the streetcar lines to facilitate movement of automobiles. Local governments in the East Bay attempted to purchase the Key System, but were unsuccessful. Streetcars were converted to buses during November/December 1948. In 1949 National City Lines, General Motors and others were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to their subsidiary transit companies throughout the U.S.See appeals court ruling: Altlaw.org Between 1946 and 1954 transbay fares increased from 20¬¢ to 50¬¢ ($ to $ adjusted for inflation). Fares in this period were used to operate and for 'motorisation' which included streetcar track removal, repaving, purchase of new buses and the construction of bus maintenance facilities. Transbay ridership fell from 22.2 million in 1946 to 9.8 million in 1952. The Key System's famed commuter train system was dismantled in 1958 after many years of declining ridership as well by the corrupt monopolistic efforts of National City Lines. The last run was on April 20, 1958. In 1960, the newly formed publicly owned AC Transit took over the Key System's facilities. Most of the rolling stock was scrapped, with some sold to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Several streetcars, interurbans and bridge units were salvaged for collections in the United States. Of the large bridge units, three are at the Western Railway Museum near Rio Vista, CaliforniaWRM equipment roster. while another is at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in southern California. System details 1926 map of the lines prior to the construction of the Bay Bridge The initial connection across the Bay to San Francisco was by ferryboat via a causeway and pier (\\"mole\\"), extending from the end of Yerba Buena Avenue in Oakland, California, westward 16,000 feet (4,900 m) to a ferry terminal near Yerba Buena Island. Filling for the causeway had been started by a short-lived narrow-gauge railroad company in the late 19th century, the California and Nevada Railroad. \\"Borax\\" Smith acquired the causeway from the California and Nevada upon its bankruptcy. On May 6, 1933, a major fire erupted on the pier end of the mole, consuming the ferry terminal building as well as gutting the ferryboat Peralta. The pier was subsequently reconstructed and a new terminal building erected. The Key System operated a fleet of ferries between the Key Route PierExhibit Name: Trains of Oakland , Oakland Museum of California and the San Francisco Ferry Building until 1939 when a new dual track opened on the south side of the lower deck of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, bringing Key System trains to the then- new Transbay Terminal in San Francisco's downtown. The bridge railway and Transbay Terminal were shared with the Southern Pacific's Interurban Electric and the Western Pacific's Sacramento Northern railroads. The Key System's first trains were composed of standard wooden railroad passenger cars, complete with clerestory roofs. Atop each of these, a pair of pantographs, invented and manufactured by the Key System's own shops, were installed to collect current from overhead wires to power a pair of electric motors on each car, one on each truck (bogie).The Key Route, Harre Demoro, v.1, pp.16-17, publ. Interurban Press (1985) The design of rolling stock changed over the years. Wood gave way to steel, and, instead of doors at each end, center doors were adopted. The later rolling stock consisted of specially designed \\"bridge units\\" for use on the new bridge, articulated cars sharing a common central truck and including central passenger entries in each car, a forerunner of the design of most light rail vehicles today. Several of these pairs were connected to make up a train. Power pickup was via pantograph from overhead catenary wires, except on the Bay Bridge where a third rail pickup was used. The Key's trains ran on 600 volt direct current, compared to the 1200 volts used by the SP commuter trains. The cars had an enclosed operator's cab in the right front, with passenger seats extending to the very front of the vehicle, a favorite seat for many children, with dramatic views of the tracks ahead. The exterior color of the cars was orange and silver. Interior upholstery was woven reed seat covers in one of the articulated sections, and leather in the other, the smoking section. The flooring was linoleum. During WWII, the roofs were painted gray for aerial camouflage.The Key Route, Harre Demoro, v.1, p.105, publ. Interurban Press (1985) After acquisition by National City Lines, all Key vehicles including the bridge units were re-painted in that company's standard colors, yellow and green. =Transbay rail lines= 1941 Key System map with a detail of the Transbay Terminal Until the Bay Bridge railway began operation, Key commuter trains had no letter designation. They were named for the principal street or district they served. *A ‚Äì Downtown Oakland (was extended far into East Oakland to near the San Leandro border on the competing Southern Pacific interurban (see East Bay Electric Lines) tracks when they shut down their operations in 1941) *B ‚Äì Lakeshore and Trestle Glen (originally ran through a Key hotel, the Key Route Inn at Grand and Broadway in Oakland; the Inn burned down in the 1930s) *C ‚Äì Piedmont (Via 40th Street and Piedmont Avenue; alongside Pleasant Valley and Arroyo avenues; and between York Drive and Ricardo Avenue to terminus at Oakland Avenue). Originally terminated at Piedmont Avenue; extended to Oakland Avenue on November 21, 1924. *E ‚Äì Claremont (ran directly to the Claremont Hotel, terminating on a track between the two tennis courts; the tennis courts survive to this day) *F ‚Äì Berkeley / Adeline Street (was also extended on former Southern Pacific interurban tracks on Shattuck Avenue beyond Dwight Way and through the SP's Northbrae Tunnel, terminating at Solano Avenue and The Alameda) *G ‚Äì Westbrae Shuttle (actually, a streetcar shuttle providing a connection at University Avenue with the H transbay train) *H ‚Äì Monterey Avenue (originally, the Sacramento Street Line; the original line ran up Hopkins, but was switched to the SP's old tracks up Monterey after 1933) *K ‚Äì College Avenue (also a streetcar shuttle providing a connection at Alcatraz Avenue and Adeline Street with the F transbay train); this line ran extra cars and was heavily used on football game days as its terminus was only a few blocks away from UC's Memorial Stadium *D was reserved for a proposed line into Montclair alongside the Sacramento Northern interurban railway The A, B, C, E and F lines were the last Key System rail lines. Train service ended on April 20, 1958, replaced by buses using the same letter designations. AC Transit preserved the letter- designated routes when it took over the Key System two years later, and are still in use; AC Transit's B, C, E, F, G and H lines follow roughly the corresponding Key routes and neighborhoods. =East Bay Street railways= 1911 map showing the various streetcar and commuter train lines that would later become the Key System The Key System's streetcars operated as a separate division under the name \\"Oakland Traction Company\\", later changed to \\"East Bay Street Railways. Ltd\\", and finally to \\"East Bay Transit Co.\\", reflecting the increasing use of buses. The numbering of the streetcar lines changed several times over the years. The Key System's streetcars operated out of several carbarns. The Central Carhouse was on the east side of Lake Merritt on Third Avenue. The Western Carhouse was located at 51st and Telegraph Avenue in the Temescal District of Oakland. The Elmhurst Carhouse was in the east Oakland district of Elmhurst, on East 14th (International Blvd.) between 94th and 96th Avenues. The Northern Carhouse was in Richmond where today's AC Transit has a bus yard. In the early years of operation, these were supplemented by a number of smaller carbarns scattered throughout the East Bay area, many of them inherited from the pre-Key companies acquired by \\"Borax\\" Smith. The Key streetcars were originally painted dark green and cream white, then orange. They were re-painted in the green and yellow scheme of National City Lines after NCL acquired the Key System.Key System Streetcars, by Vernon Sappers, Signature Press, 2007. The Key System had ordered 40 trolley coaches from ACF- Brill in 1945 to convert the East Bay trolley lines. The new NCL management canceled the Key's trackless program in 1946 before wire changes were made, and diverted the order (some units of which had already been painted for the Key and delivered to Oakland) to its own Los Angeles Transit Lines, where they ran until 1963.The Yellow Cars of Los Angeles, by Jim Walker. Interurbans Press, 1977. The last Key streetcars ran on November 28, 1947, replaced by buses.Key System Streetcars, by Vernon J. Sappers (2007), pp.123-25] =Related rail systems= *The Key System organized its freight business in 1929 as the Key Terminal Railway, Ltd. In 1938, the name was changed to the Oakland Terminal Railroad, Ltd. In 1943 the Oakland Terminal Railroad was jointly purchased by the Western Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and is now known as the Oakland Terminal Railway. *The Eastshore and Suburban Railway (E&SR;) was a formerly independent unit of the Key System which ran streetcar trains in Richmond, San Pablo, and El Cerrito. Service to Oakland required a transfer to Oakland Traction Company trains at the County Line station and service to San Francisco required an additional transfer. *See also the East Bay Electric Lines; another transbay commuter rail system operated by the Southern Pacific in the East Bay until 1941. *See also the Sacramento Northern Railroad, an interurban system running from Chico through Sacramento to Oakland which also used some of the Key System's trackage as well as the Key System's ferry pier, and later ran to the Transbay Terminal until 1941. =Other properties= From the beginning, the Key System had been conceived as a dual real estate and transportation system. \\"Borax\\" Smith and his partner Frank C. Havens first established a company called the \\"Realty Syndicate\\" which acquired large tracts of undeveloped land throughout the East Bay. The Realty Syndicate also built two large hotels, each served by a San Francisco-bound train, the Claremont and the Key Route Inn, and a popular amusement park in Oakland called Idora Park. Streetcar lines were also routed to serve all these properties, thereby enhancing their value. In its early years, the Key System was actually a subsidiary of the Realty Syndicate. Berkeley's numerous paths, lanes, walks and steps, were put in place in many of the newly developed neighborhoods, often in the middle of a city block, so that commuters could walk more directly to the new train system. Berkeley's pathways are still maintained by local groups. Legacy Key System car #187 preserved at Western Railway Museum.

Volumes 1-2 Princeton University Press, 1990. The Greek geographer Strabo (c.63 BC ‚Äì c. 24 AD) writes: Nevertheless, various places have been associated with the Gigantomachy. The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants.Mayor, p. 197 ff.; Apollodorus 1.6.1 n. 3; Frazer 1898b, note to Pausanias 8.29.1 \\"the legendary battle of the gods and the giants\\" pp. 314-315; Pausanias, 8.32.5; Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 5.16 (pp. 498-501), On Heroes 8.15-16 (p. 14). Pindar writes that the battle occurred at Phlegra (\\"the place of burning\\"), as do other early sources.Aeschylus, Eumenides 294; Euripides, Heracles 1192-1194; Ion 987-997; Aristophanes, The Birds 824; Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 3.232-234 (pp. 210-211), 3.1225-7 (pp. 276-277).

Apollodorus, who placed the battle at Pallene, says the Giants were born \\"as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene\\". But the name Phlegra and the Gigantomachy were also often associated, by later writers, with the Phlegraean Plain, the volcanic fields, at the east of Cumae.Strabo, 5.4.4, 5.4.6, 6.3.5; Diodorus Siculus, 4.21.5-7, 5.71.4. Diodorus Siculus presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on Crete.Diodorus Siculus, 4.15.1, 4.21.5-7, 5.71.2-6. Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place, individual battles between Giant and god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of Nisyros (or Kos).Hanfmann 1937, p. 475 n. 52. Strabo also refers to the Phlegraean Plain (, ', or , ',. later ' ), in Campania, \\"which mythology has made the setting of the story of the Giants\\": According to the Greek geographer, the Giants who survived, were driven out by Heracles, finding refuge with their mother in Leuca (Apulia), in Italy's 'heel'. A fountain there had smelly water the locals claimed to be from the ichor of the giants. Strabo also mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at Phanagoria, a Greek colony on the shores of the Black Sea.Strabo, Geography 11.2.10.

During the carnival, the city goes wild and unleashes all the joy it has bottled up all year. It is not advisable to wear nice clothes during this festival, as during these celebrations people have fun painting each other's faces with cosmetic colors (skin safe and created for this special purpose) and throwing talcum powder and party foam. The carnival takes place between January 2 and 7 each year. A specialty of this region is a pre-Columbian art technique called Barniz de Pasto, or Pasto Varnish in English. This uses a type of natural rubber (extracted from a tree called mopa-mopa) which is colored and then stretched over woodwork pieces; finally, the skillful artisan uses a special knife to cut and create the many beautiful designs that characterize this artistic technique.

Gastronomy Women preparing typical local food: roast guinea pig, boiled chicken, boiled potatoes, toasted maize, pork crackling, suckling pig and maize pasties.

Some of the typical drinks are made of heated juice of, for example, lulo, mora (similar to blackberries) and passion fruit. These make the base of a drink that may be strengthened by a local liquor called chapil or aguardiente.  Sports  \\"Libertad\\" Departmental Stadium. San Juan de Pasto has developed an extensive sports culture, both recreational and competitive. Football is one of the main sports practiced in the city since November 1909 when Leslie Osmond Spain, a British citizen who was visiting the area for commercial purposes, organised a football match in a makeshift court in the Barrio of San Andr√©s, and three months into his stay in the city formed the first football team.Munoz, Lydia Agnes. History of Pasto Manual, Volume 7. Manual Pasto history. Editor Nari√±ense Academy of History, 1996. , 9789583335846 The city is home to Deportivo Pasto, a team founded in 1949, which remained outside the professionals until 1996 when it ascended to the Primera B and two years later was promoted to the Primera A league of Colombian professional football. In June 2006, they were crowned champions, earning a spot to compete in the 2007 Copa Libertadores. In 2009, they won second place in the Copa Colombia, losing from the collections of the maximum penalty against Santa Fe and in the same year relegated to Primera B. Pasto regained its first place in category A in December 2011, when they beat Patriotas Boyac√°.

Originally illustrated by Hal Forrest and initially distributed by John Neville Wheeler's Bell Syndicate and then by United Feature Syndicate, the strip had a 14-year run from May 21, 1928 to March 15, 1942. In the wake of Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight across the Atlantic, the public's fascination with aviation escalated. Tailspin Tommy was the first aviation-based comic strip to appear as a result of this heightened interest. The strip's 1928 launch was followed by others, notably Skyroads (1929-1942), Scorchy Smith (1930-1961), The Adventures of Smilin' Jack (1933-1973) and Flyin' Jenny (1939-1946).  Publication history  Scripted by Glenn Chaffin, a newspaper journalist and press agent, Tailspin Tommy began its run in four newspapers on May 21, 1928. By 1931, it was published in more than 250 newspapers across the country. After buying out Chaffin's interest, Forrest took over the scripting; his first credited Sunday strip ran on January 7, 1934, and his first Sunday appeared on January 22. Forrest wrote and drew the strip solo for the next three years. In 1936, Forrest took on an assistant, Reynold Brown, who inked (uncredited) over Forrest's pencils. Tailspin Tommy is held by some to have improved with Brown's contribution.CollectAir: \\"Hal Forrest and Tailspin Tommy\\" The Sunday page had several topper strips over the course of the run: Progress of Flight (1930-1933), Four Aces (1934-1941), How to Fly (1935), War Plane Insignia (1935) and Tailspin Tommy Flying Club (1935-1941). Characters and story Living in Littleville, Colorado, young Tommy Tomkins had such an obsession with flying that he was given the nickname Tailspin Tommy before he ever actually went inside a plane. Although Tommy took an aero-engineering correspondence course, his real introduction to aviation happened when mail pilot Milt Howe made an emergency landing in a field near Tommy's neighborhood. Tommy watched the downward spiral of Milt's plane and ran to help. Howe rewarded Tommy with a greasemonkey job in Texas at the Three Point Airlines, where he soon became a pilot along with his girlfriend, Betty Lou Barnes, and his best buddy, Peter \\"Skeeter\\" Milligan. The trio eventually became part owners in Three Point and took off for many airborne adventures.Tailspin Tommy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on September 23, 2015. By 1940, Tailspin Tommy began to lose papers. A change in syndicates from Bell to United Features did little to help, and the strip ended on March 15, 1942. Film Tailspin Tommy flew into movie theaters throughout the 1930s. He was portrayed by Maurice Murphy in the 12-episode 1934 movie serial Tailspin Tommy. Another 12-chapter serial, Tailspin Tommy in the Great Air Mystery (1935), starred Clark Williams in the title role. John Trent portrayed Tommy in a series of hour-long features, including Mystery Plane, Stunt Pilot, Sky Patrol and Danger Flight. All were released in 1939. Comic books and reprints 1933 Big Little Book Stephen Slesinger Inc. published a series of 30 Tailspin Tommy Adventures in eight- page booklet form as a promotion with Big Thrill Chewing Gum. In 1936, C.J.H. Publications put out two issues of Tailspin Tommy Adventure Magazine. The magazines published adaptations of comic strip stories. Publication apparently ceased because the rights to the character had not been properly secured. After taking over the syndication, United Features published two Tailspin Tommy comic books, one in 1940 and one in 1946. Tailspin Tommy also saw reprints in Dell Comics' The Funnies and Popular Comics. In 1934, Tailspin Tommy was among the strips reprinted in the first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, published by Max Gaines at Eastern Color Printing. That same year, Slesinger began publishing a series of Tailspin Tommy books in its Big Little Book line.

In 2017/18 it had a gross income of ¬£151 million.Charity Commission History The first boys to be admitted to The Children's Home in 1869 The first 'Children's Home', a renovated stable in Church Street, Waterloo, was founded in 1869 by Methodist minister Thomas Bowman Stephenson, who had been moved by the plight of children living on the street in London. The first two boys were admitted on 9 July 1869. In 1871 the home was moved to Bonner Road, Lambeth, and girls were admitted. The home was approved by the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in the same year. A year later, in 1872, a second home opened in Edgworth, Lancashire. An emigration scheme was set up in 1873 and a branch in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, opened. The homes were divided into small family units run by a 'house mother' and 'house father', which was in marked contrast to the large institutions and workhouses common at the time. Training was also an important aspect. A childcare course was set up in 1878 and the graduates of this programme ‚Äì who were called 'the Sisterhood' or 'the Sisters of the Children' ‚Äì went on to work in the Home. An Industrial School at Milton, Gravesend, was taken over in 1875 and a children's refuge in Ramsey on the Isle of Man established in 1882. With the opening of the Princess Alice Orphanage in Birmingham the Home was renamed to 'Children's Home and Orphanage'. Further properties in Alverstoke, Hampshire; Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire; Frodsham, Cheshire; and Bramhope near Leeds were acquired and, by 1908, the charity had grown to become the 'National Children's Home and Orphanage'. In 1913 work began on a large site in Harpenden, which became home to over 200 children, with a print works for apprentices. It subsequently became the charity's head office. Many other new branches and schools were founded, including the first residential nursery branch in Sutton Coldfield in 1929 and the first Scottish branch in Glasgow in 1955. The charity became an adoption agency in 1926. In 1994, the charity changed its name to 'NCH Action for Children'. Fourteen years later, in September 2008, it became 'Action for Children'. The changes reflected a shift away from providing children's homes (most of which have now closed) to a wider range of services. Projects and services David Worthington, 2010. Red Iranian Travertine stone, Great Queen Street, London. Action for Children works in partnership with statutory bodies to deliver services for children, young people and their families in five main areas: = Family support = Action for Children is a major provider of family support services and works in partnership with local authorities across the UK. The aim is to facilitate early intervention and then offer long term help, so families can stay together if possible. This is provided through children's and family centres, parenting programmes and targeted intervention initiatives, often with the hardest to reach groups in the community. = Disability = Action for Children runs specialist projects for disabled children and those with learning and behavioural difficulties. These include residential care, short breaks and respite care services, keyworker support for families and carers, and advocacy work to help young disabled people transition into adulthood. = Children in care = Action for Children is a registered adoption agency and delivers fostering programmes. The charity also runs a number of small residential units for children and young people, as well as supporting young care leavers moving into independent living. = Support for young people = Action for Children works with vulnerable and disadvantaged young people. Issues these youngsters may face include alcohol and substance misuse, anti-social behaviour, homelessness and unemployment. Other services offer support for young carers, teenage parents, victims of sexual abuse and those leaving young offenders institutions. This support is provided through a range of services, which offer counselling, help with housing and benefits, access to training and education, basic skills tuition, mediation and mentoring. = Education = Action for Children runs a number of schools for children and young people with disabilities, profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD) and challenging behaviour (including social or emotional problems). The charity's aim is to offer a secure environment in which to facilitate educational, social and personal development adapted to pupils' individual abilities. The schools offer both residential placements and day care. Research Action for Children carries out and commissions research into issues around children, young people and families. The charity also produces a yearly Impact Report, which details research findings on the outcomes and cost effectiveness of its work supporting children and young people. Campaigning Action for Children hosted the 2014 Byte Night Overnight Challenge. Action for Children campaigns and lobbies governments on behalf of vulnerable children and young people and their families. One of the charity's current campaigns, 'Best Start in Life', seeks to address the issue of children ‚Äì particularly those from poorer backgrounds ‚Äì struggling to receive the right early years support. The campaign calls on the government to take urgent action so that children under five do not fall behind, either due to cuts in vital services or unequal access to opportunities.Action for Children 'Best Start in Life' campaign Action for Children is a member of the Disabled Children's Partnership alongside 27 other charities, working towards better health and social care for disabled children, young people and their families. The charity also leads the children and families work of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness and is a partner of End Child Poverty. Fundraising Action for Children raises money through corporate partnerships, fundraising events (such as sponsored runs) and through its partnership with the British Methodist Church. The charity is also involved with several large fundraising events, including Byte Night ‚Äì an IT industry event which raises money to prevent youth homelessness ‚Äì and Never Mind The Business, a music-based quiz night for business people. In 2018, Action for Children launched its Secret Santa fundraising campaign.Action for Children's Secret Santa fundraising campaign, launched 2018 The campaign encouraged the public to become a Secret Santa for a vulnerable child, donating ¬£10 or more to bring joy, warmth and safety to children in the UK at Christmas.

He became the subject of extensive media coverage beginning in mid-2002, when he was a suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks.Lichtblau, Eric. \\"Scientist Officially Exonerated in Anthrax Attacks\\". The New York Times. August 8, 2008. His home was repeatedly raided by the FBI, his phone was tapped, and he was extensively surveilled for more than two years; he was also fired from his job at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).David Freed, The Wrong Man, The Atlantic, May 2010. At a news conference in August 2002, Hatfill denied that he had anything to do with the anthrax letters and said \\"irresponsible news media coverage based on government leaks\\" had \\"destroyed his reputation\\". He filed a lawsuit in 2003, accusing the FBI agents and Justice Department officials who led the criminal investigation of leaking information about him to the press in violation of the federal Privacy Act. In 2008, the government settled Hatfill's lawsuit with a $4.6 million annuity totaling $5.8 million in payment. The government officially exonerated him of any involvement in the anthrax attacks, and the Justice Department identified another military scientist, Bruce Edward Ivins, as the sole perpetrator of the anthrax attacks. Jeffrey A. Taylor, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, wrote in a letter to Hatfill's lawyer that \\"we have concluded, based on laboratory access records, witness accounts and other information, that Dr. Hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks, and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings.\\" In 2004, Hatfill filed lawsuits against several periodicals and journalists who had identified him as a figure warranting further investigation in the anthrax attacks. He sued the New York Times Company and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof for defamation, defamation per se, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in connection with five of Kristof's columns in 2002. The courts dismissed this suit, finding that Hatfill was a limited purpose public figure.Jerry Markon, Former Army Scientist Sues New York Times, Columnist, Washington Post, July 14, 2004.Timothy J. Connor, Fourth Circuit Throws Out Hatfill Libel Claim Against The New York Times, Holland & Knight, September/October 2008.Bill Mears, High court tosses scientist's libel suit against New York Times, CNN, December 15, 2008. In 2007, Hatfill settled a similar libel lawsuit against Vanity Fair and Reader's Digest for an undisclosed amount, after both magazines agreed to formally retract any implication that Hatfill was involved in the anthrax mailings. In 2010, Hatfill was an independent researcher and an adjunct assistant professor of emergency medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center.Cameron Bird, Steven Hatfill's Strange Trip From Accused Terrorist to Medical Adventurer, Newsweek, June 18, 2014. He has criticized the response of health authorities to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and suggested that it is possible that Ebola could be transmitted by aerosol, a position which other experts have criticized.James Hamblin, 21 Days: An expert in biological warfare warns against complacency in public measures against Ebola, The Atlantic, October 26, 2014.Stephen Goldstein, Assessing the Science of Ebola Transmission: The research on how the virus spreads is not as ambiguous as some have made it seem, The Atlantic, October 28, 2014. Early life Hatfill was born in Saint Louis, Missouri, and graduated from Mattoon Senior High School, Mattoon, Illinois (1971), and Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas (1975), where he studied biology. Hatfill was enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army from 1975 to 1977.Cooper, Simon \\"The Lesson of Steve Hatfill\\", Seed magazine, May/June 2003. (In 1999, he would tell a journalist during an interview that he had been a \\"captain in the U.S. Special Forces\\", but in a subsequent investigation the Army stated that he had never served with the Special Forces.Preston, Richard (2002), The Demon in the Freezer, New York: Random House, pp. 206‚Äì07.) Following his Army discharge, Hatfill qualified and worked as a medical laboratory technician, but soon resolved to become a doctor. He worked as a medical missionary in Kapanga, Zaire under a mentor, Dr. Glenn Eschtruth, who was murdered there in 1977. A brief marriage to Dr. Eschtruth's daughter, Caroline Rush Eschtruth, during this period (1976‚Äì78) produced one daughter. Medical education In 1978, Hatfill settled in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and entered the Godfrey Huggins Medical School at the University of Rhodesia in Salisbury (now Harare). (His claimed military associations during this period included assistance as a medic with the Selous Scouts and membership in the Rhodesian SAS, but according to one journalistCooper (2003), Op. cit. the regimental association of the latter is \\"adamant Hatfill never belonged to the unit\\".) He graduated (after failing in 1983) with a M ChB degree in 1984 and then completed a one-year internship (1984‚Äì85) at a small rural hospital in South Africa's North West Province. The South African government recruited him to be medical officer on a 14-month (1986‚Äì88) tour of duty in Antarctica with the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE). He then completed (1988) a master's degree in microbiology at the University of Cape Town. He worked toward a second master's (1990; medical biochemistry and radiation biology) at the University of Stellenbosch, while working again as a medical technician in the university's clinical hematology lab. A 3-year hematological pathology residency (1991‚Äì93) at Stellenbosch followed, during which time Hatfill conducted research on the treatment of leukemia with thalidomide. This research, toward an anticipated PhD degree, was conducted (1992‚Äì95) under the supervision of microbiology professor Ralph Kirby at Rhodes University. Hatfill submitted his PhD thesis for examination to Rhodes in January 1995, but it was failed in November and no degree was ever granted. Hatfill later claimed a Ph.D. degree in \\"molecular cell biology\\" from Rhodes, as well as completion of a post-doctoral fellowship (1994‚Äì95) at the University of Oxford in England and three master's degrees (in microbial genetics, medical biochemistry, and experimental pathology). Some of these credentials have been questioned. During a later investigation, officials at Rhodes insisted that he had never been awarded a Ph.D. from their institution.Preston, Op. cit., pp. 207‚Äì08. (In 2007, Hatfill's lawyer Tom Connolly ‚Äì in his lawsuit against former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and the FBI ‚Äì admitted that his client had \\"Puffed on his resume. Absolutely. Forged a diploma. Yes, that's true.\\") Back in the United States, another of Hatfill's post-doctoral appointments commenced at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1995. He subsequently worked (1997‚Äì99) as a civilian researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), the U.S. Department of Defense's medical research institute for biological warfare (BW) defense at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland. There he studied, under a National Research Council fellowship, new drug treatments for the Ebola virus and became an authority on BW defense. Anthrax attacks In January 1999 Hatfill transferred to a \\"consulting job\\" at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which has a \\"sprawling campus\\" in nearby McLean, Virginia. The corporation did work for a multitude of federal agencies. Many projects were classified. Hatfill designed BW defense training curricula for government agencies. By this time there had been a number of hoax anthrax mailings in the United States. Hatfill and his collaborator, SAIC vice president Joseph Soukup, commissioned William C. Patrick, retired head of the old US bioweapons program (who had also been a mentor of Hatfill) to write a report on the possibilities of terrorist anthrax mailing attacks. Barbara Hatch Rosenberg (director of the Federation of American Scientists' biochem weapons working group in 2002) said that the report was commissioned \\"under a CIA contract to SAIC\\". However, SAIC said Hatfill and Soukup commissioned it internally ‚Äì there was no outside client. The resulting report, dated February 1999, was subsequently seen by some as a \\"blueprint\\" for the 2001 anthrax attacks. Amongst other things, it suggested the maximum amount of anthrax powder ‚Äì 2.5 grams ‚Äì that could be put in an envelope without making a suspicious bulge. The quantity in the envelope sent to Senator Patrick Leahy in October 2001 was .871 grams. After the attacks, the report drew the attention of the media and others, and led to their investigation of Patrick and Hatfill.William J Broad, \\"Terror Anthrax Linked to Type Made by U.S.\\", New York Times, 3 Dec. 2001; Barbara Hatch Rosenberg (director of the Federation of American Scientists' biochem weapons working group), \\"Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks\\" (copy); Guy Gugliotta and Dan Eggen, \\"Biological Warfare Experts Questioned in Anthrax Probe\\", Washington Post, June 28, 2002 (UCLA copy); Brian Ross, \\"Blueprint for Anthrax Attack\\", ABC News online, 27 June 2002; Marilyn W Thompson, \\"The Pursuit of Steven Hatfill\\", Washington Post, 14 September 2003, p. W06.) =Assertions by Rosenberg = In October 2001, as soon as it became known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and others began suggesting that the attack might be the work of a \\"rogue CIA agent\\", and they provided the name of the \\"most likely\\" person to the FBI. On November 21, 2001, Rosenberg made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published \\"A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax\\" via the web site of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) suggesting the attacks were \\"perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program\\". Rosenberg discussed the case with reporters from the New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times published a column titled \\"Profile of a Killer\\" stating \\"I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall.\\" For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted \\"Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks\\" to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002 she published an article called \\"Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?\\" At the time, the FBI denied reports that investigators had identified a chief suspect, saying \\"There is no prime suspect in this case at this time.\\" The Washington Post reported that \\"FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg's claims.\\" On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted \\"The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows\\" to the FAS site. On June 18, 2002, Rosenberg presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. One week later, on June 25, the FBI publicly searched Hatfill's apartment, turning him into a household name. \\"The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect.\\" Both The American Prospect and Salon.com reported that \\"Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says.\\" On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg told the media that the FBI asked her if \\"a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill.\\" =Person of interest= In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Hatfill a \\"person of interest\\" in a press conference, although no charges were brought against him. Hatfill, who researched viruses, vehemently denied he had anything to do with the anthrax (bacteria) mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced it would settle Hatfill's case for $5.8 million. Hatfill later went to work at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In September 2001 SAIC was commissioned by the Pentagon to create a replica of a mobile WMD \\"laboratory\\", alleged to have been used by Saddam Hussein, who was President of Iraq at the time. The Pentagon claimed the trailer was to be used as a training aid for teams seeking weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. His lawyer, Victor M. Glasberg, stated: \\"Steve's life has been devastated by a drumbeat of innuendo, implication and speculation. We have a frightening public attack on an individual who, guilty or not, should not be exposed to this type of public opprobrium based on speculation.\\" In an embarrassing incident, FBI agents trailing Hatfill in a motor vehicle ran over his foot when he attempted to approach them in May 2003. Police responding to the incident did not cite the driver, but issued Hatfill a citation for \\"walking to create a hazard\\". He and his attorneys fought the ticket, but a hearing officer upheld the ticket and ordered Hatfill to pay the requisite $5 fine. FBI Director Robert Mueller changed leadership of the investigation in late 2006, and at that time another suspect, USAMRIID bacteriologist Bruce Ivins, became the main focus of the investigation. Considerable questions have been raised, however, about the credibility of the case against Ivins as well. =60 Minutes interview= Hatfill's lawyer, Tom Connolly, was featured in a CBS News 60 Minutes interview about the anthrax incidents on March 11, 2007. In the interview Connolly revealed that Hatfill forged a Ph.D. degree certificate: \\"It is true. It is true that he has puffed on his resume. Absolutely. Forged a diploma. Yes, that's true.\\" He went on to state, \\"Listen, if puffing on your resume made you the anthrax killer, then half this town should be suspect.\\" The New York Times stated in their paper that Hatfill had obtained an anti-anthrax medicine (ciprofloxacin) immediately prior to the anthrax mailings. Connolly explained, \\"Before the attacks he had surgery. So yes, he's on Cipro. But the fuller truth is in fact he was on Cipro because a doctor gave it to him after sinus surgery.\\" Hatfill had previously said the antibiotic was for a lingering sinus infection. The omission in the Times' article, of the reason why he had been taking Cipro, is one reason Hatfill sued the newspaper. The newspaper won a summary judgment ruling in early 2007, squelching the libel suit that had been filed by Steven Hatfill against it and columnist Nicholas Kristof. Lawsuits =Hatfill v. John Ashcroft, et al.= On August 26, 2003, Hatfill filed a lawsuit against the Attorney General of the United States John Ashcroft, the United States Department of Justice, DOJ employees Timothy Beres and Daryl Darnell, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI Supervisory Special Agent Van Harp and an unknown number of FBI agents. On March 30, 2007, US District Judge Reggie Walton issued an order warning Hatfill that he could lose his civil lawsuit over the leaks if he did not compel journalists to name their sources. He gave Hatfill until April 16 to decide whether to press the journalists to give up their sources. On April 16, Hatfill gave notice that he would \\"proceed with discovery to attempt to obtain the identity of the alleged source or sources at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation who allegedly provided information to news reporters concerning the criminal investigation of Dr. Hatfill.\\" On April 27, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, federal prosecutors wrote that Steven Hatfill had overstepped court orders allowing him to compel testimony from reporters whom he had already questioned and had instead \\"served a new round of subpoenas\\" on organizations \\"that he failed to question during the discovery period.\\" During the first round of depositions, Hatfill subpoenaed six reporters: Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman of Newsweek, Brian Ross of ABC, Allan Lengel of The Washington Post, Jim Stewart of CBS, and Toni Locy of USA Today. Hatfill then subpoenaed eight news organizations, including three that he didn't name before: The New York Times (Nicolas Kristof, David Johnson, William Broad, Kate Zernike, Judith Miller, Scott Shane, and Frank D. Roylance), The Baltimore Sun (Gretchen Parker and Curt Anderson), and the Associated Press. Subpoenas for Washington Post writers Marilyn W. Thompson, David Snyder, Guy Gugliotta, Tom Jackman, Dan Eggen and Carol D. Loenning, and for Mark Miller of Newsweek, were included. The Justice Department responded to Hatfill's subpoenas, saying that they went too far. \\"The court should reject this attempt to expand discovery,\\" prosecutors wrote. In a status conference on Friday 11 January 2008, U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton ordered the attorneys for the government and for Hatfill to seek mediation over the next two months. According to the Scheduling Order, the parties will be in mediation from January 14 until May 14, 2008. The prospects of a mediated settlement notwithstanding, Walton said he expected that a trial on the lawsuit could begin in December. Afterward, Hatfill's attorney Mark A. Grannis said: \\"The court has set a schedule for bringing this case to trial this year, and we're very pleased at the prospect that Dr. Hatfill will finally have his day in court.\\" On March 7, 2008, Toni Locy of USA Today was ordered to personally pay contempt of court fines of up to $5,000 a day which begin the following Tuesday, until she identifies her sources. On June 27, 2008 Hatfill was exonerated by the government and a settlement was announced in which the Justice Department has agreed to pay $4.6 million (consisting of $2.825 million in cash and an annuity paying $150,000 a year for 20 years) to settle the lawsuit in which Hatfill claimed the Justice Department violated his privacy rights by speaking with reporters about the case.url =http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal- hatfill0627,0,4041368.storyAnthrax Scientist Reported to Kill Self; Associated Press; 2008-08-01; accessed 2008-08-01 =Hatfill v. The New York Times= In July 2004, Hatfill filed a lawsuit against The New York Times Company and Nicholas D. Kristof. In a sealed motionhttp://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/nyt122906.pdf on December 29, 2006, The New York Times argued that the classification restrictions imposed on the case were tantamount to an assertion of the state secrets privilege. Times attorneys cited the case law on state secrets to support their argument that the case should be dismissed. The \\"state secrets\\" doctrine, they said, \\"precludes a case from proceeding to trial when national security precludes a party from obtaining evidence that is... necessary to support a valid defense. Dismissal is warranted in this case because the Times has been denied access to such evidence, specifically documents and testimony concerning the work done by plaintiff [Hatfill] on classified government projects relating to bioweapons, including anthrax.\\" A redacted copy of the December 29, 2006 New York Times Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant's Motion for an Order Dismissing the Complaint Under the \\"State Secrets\\" Doctrine was obtained by Secrecy News.The State Secrets Doctrine and the Hatfill Case. Attorneys for Hatfill filed a sealed response on January 12, 2007 in opposition to the motion for dismissal on state secrets grounds. A redacted copyHatfill v.

On January 12, 2007, a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Hatfill against The New York Times.Federal judge dismisses anthrax defamation suit against New York Times. On January 30, 2007, Judge Hilton's order dismissing the Hatfill v. The New York Times was made public, along with a Memorandum Opinion explaining his ruling. Kenneth A. Richieri, Vice President and General Counsel of The New York Times described what he called a \\"very satisfying win\\" at the beginning of 2007 in the Eastern District of Virginia. The newspaper won a summary judgment ruling squelching a libel suit that had been filed by anthrax poisoning \\"person of interest\\" Steven Hatfill against it and columnist Nicholas Kristof. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the trial court, ruling that a jury should decide that issue. In March 2008, the Supreme Court refused to grant certiorari in the case, effectively leaving the appeals court decision in place. The case was dismissed in a Summary Judgment on January 12, 2007. The appeals were heard on March 21, 2008, and the dismissal was upheld by the appeals court on July 14, 2008. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and was rejected by the Supreme Court on Dec. 15, 2008. The basis for the dismissal was that Dr. Hatfill was a \\"public figure\\", and he had not proved malice on the part of The New York Times. see: New York Times Co. v. Sullivan =Hatfill v. Foster= Donald Foster, an expert in forensic linguistics, advised the FBI during the investigation of the anthrax attacks. He later wrote an article for Vanity Fair about his investigation of Hatfill. In the October 2003 article Foster described how he had tried to match up Hatfill's travels with the postmarks on the anthrax letters, and analyzed old interviews and an unpublished novel by Hatfill about a bioterror attack on the United States. Foster wrote that \\"When I lined up Hatfill's known movements with the postmark locations of reported biothreats, those hoax anthrax attacks appeared to trail him like a vapor cloud\\". Hatfill subsequently sued Donald Foster, Cond√© Nast Publications, Vassar College, and The Reader's Digest Association. The suit sought $10 million in damages, claiming defamation.Hatfill strikes back in anthrax case on NBC News The Reader's Digest published a condensed version of the article in December 2003. The lawyers delayed bringing the Hatfill v. Foster lawsuit to court because \\"the parties are close to finalizing the settlement\\". On February 27, 2007, The New York Sun reported that he settled without a trial. =Hatfill v. John Michie and Google= In 2010, Hatfill sued Google to persuade them to hand over the IP address behind the blog of one \\"Luigi Warren\\", which was hosted by Google's blogspot web-hosting service. According to Newsweek, \\"Luigi Warren\\" had \\"operated a lurid rumor mill about Hatfill for more than a decade ‚Äì promoting, in particular, hearsay about the years he lived and worked in southern Africa during the throes of apartheid.\\"Bird, Cameron, \\"Steven Hatfill's Strange Trip From Accused Terrorist to Medical Adventurer\\", Newsweek, June 18, 2014. Hatfill and his lawyers soon learned that the real Luigi Warren, a stem-cell researcher at Harvard Medical School (who had, in fact, been a prolific post-9/11 commentator on his own \\"woolly blog, The Hatfill Deception\\") was not the source of the recent diatribes in question. Rather, that source was someone impersonating Warren ‚Äì one John Michie, a radiation oncologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, Hatfill's alma mater. Michie agreed to an undisclosed settlement and Google was dismissed from the lawsuit. Post-settlement life =2010s= Since the settlements of his legal cases, which included receiving $5.8 million (less legal costs) from the Justice Department (2008) and undisclosed sums from Cond√© Nast (2008) and the South African medical researcher (2010), Hatfill has pursued activities as an independent researcher. He was appointed an adjunct assistant professor of emergency medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center in 2010.Bird, Op. cit. In 2011, he added additional affiliations at GW in \\"Clinical Research and Leadership\\" and \\"Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine\\". (His BA degree and one MS degree ‚Äî but not his other previously claimed medical degrees ‚Äî appear on the GW Faculty Directory.\\"Steven Hatfill\\", GW School of Medicine & Health Sciences Faculty Directory. Accessed 22 October 2019.) He oversees construction of a \\"state-of-the-art boat\\" on which he intends to conduct his own scientific trials. He has allocated more than $1 million of his own money to construct a full-scale prototype of what he calls Beagle III. This craft, with a crew of military veterans and scientists, would ply the waters of \\"high-biodiversity areas\\" ‚Äì the Amazon, or the great rivers of Borneo ‚Äì seeking and studying rare plants and fungi as sources of new drugs.

Hatfill now owns a colonial-style brick home in Marion County, Florida as well as a property in the El Yunque rain forest, in Puerto Rico, where he has run a military-style Outward Bound-like program. Hatfill chairs the Asymmetrical Biodiversity Studies and Observation Group (ABSOG) in Malaysia, a not-for- profit trust he has established to support his drug discovery boat mission. Hatfill has also established Templar Associates II, a for-profit corporation in Puerto Rico as a revenue-generator and as an \\"environmental testing ground for new tactics, techniques, equipment, and procedures for ABSOG's designated mission as well as for the U.S. military\\". Hatfill is also medical director of EFP Tactical Medical Group, a London-based company that provides integrated training, security and tactical medical support services to government agencies, private corporations, and NGOs worldwide. (EFP Tacmed has extensive Middle Eastern and African contracts; it operates a remote jungle-training facility to test new equipment in \\"high-biodiversity areas\\".)

He claims status as a fellow of the Explorers Club. In 2014, Hatfill publicly criticized the response of U.S. public health authorities to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and suggested that it is possible that Ebola could be transmitted by aerosol, an assertion which other experts have disputed;Hamblin, Op. cit. his views on this have been characterized as misrepresentations of the primary scientific literature by other experts.Stephen Goldstein, Assessing the Science of Ebola Transmission: The research on how the virus spreads is not as ambiguous as some have made it seem, The Atlantic, October 28, 2014.

Early life and career Hand was born in Clyduff, King's County (now County Offaly), Ireland, on 31 December 1744, and was baptised in Shinrone. His father was John Hand. Among his immediate neighbours were the Kearney family, ancestors of U.S. President Barack Obama.Shinrone: birthplace and resting place of Obama‚Äôs Irish ancestors He was a descendant of either the families of Mag Fhlaithimh (of south Ulaidh and Mide) or √ì Flaithimh√≠n (of the S√≠ol Muireadaigh) who, through mistranslation (Flaithimh/Flaithimh√≠n into L√°imh√≠n; laimh = hand), became Lavin or Hand.Irish Ancestors/Surnames (search \\"Lavin\\") Hand earned a medical certificate from Trinity College, Dublin. In 1767, Hand enlisted as a Surgeon's Mate in the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot. On 20 May 1767, he sailed with the regiment from Cobh, Cork, Ireland, arriving at Philadelphia on 11 July 1767. In 1772, he was commissioned an ensign. He marched with the regiment to Fort Pitt, on the forks of the Ohio River, returning to Philadelphia in 1774, where he resigned his commission. In 1774, Hand moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he practiced medicine. On 13 March 1775, he married Catherine Ewing (born 25 March 1751 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Lancaster was the region of some of the earliest Irish and Scots-Irish settlements in Pennsylvania; as a people, they were well known for their anti- English and revolutionary convictions. Hand was active in forming the Lancaster County Associators, a colonial militia. Hand was a 32nd degree Freemason, belonging to the Montgomery Military Lodge number 14. American Revolution Hand entered the Continental Army in 1775 as a lieutenant colonel in the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment under Colonel William Thompson. He was promoted to colonel in 1776 and placed in command of the 1st Continental (then designated the 1st Pennsylvania). Promoted to brigadier general in March 1777, he served as the commander of Fort Pitt, fighting British loyalists and their Indian allies. He was recalled, after over two years at Fort Pitt, to serve as a brigade commander in Major General La Fayette's division. Letter from General Edward Hand,1779 In 1778, Hand attacked the Lenape, killing Captain Pipe's mother, brother, and a few of his children during a military campaign.\\"Konieschquanoheel\\", Ohio History Central: An Online Encyclopedia of Ohio History, 1999-2011, accessed 29 January 2011 Failing to distinguish among the Native American groups, Hand had attacked the neutral Lenape while trying to reduce the Indian threat to settlers in the Ohio Country, because other tribes, such as the Shawnee, had allied with the British. After a few months, he was appointed Adjutant General of the Continental Army and served during the siege of Yorktown in that capacity. In recognition of his long and distinguished service, he was, in September 1783, promoted by brevet to major general. He resigned from the Army in November 1783.

Early life Pedro Knight Caraballo was born September 30, 1921.Steward, Sue (February 1, 2007). \\" Pedro Knight\\". The Guardian. Career Knight was a trained trumpeter, and a \\"powerfully expressive\\" musician, according to Sue Stewart of The Guardian. At age 23, he joined the Havana-based, Afro-Cuban conjunto band, La Sonora Matancera (\\"the sound of Matanzas\\", a port with a large black population), that produced, highly rhythmic dance music rooted in traditional, Africa-based styles of son and guaracha, as revived decades later by the Buena Vista Social Club. The key to the band's sound relied on trumpets, percussion, Cuban guitar, double bass, voices, and piano. At the time, Havana was emerging as one of the world's most popular musical nightspots. By the 1950s the band's sophisticated arrangements and live radio performances had become part of the golden age of Cuban music, having appeared alongside American singers such as Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan. Dexter Lehtinen, Celia Cruz, Alonso R. del Portillo, Rep. Ros-Lehtinen, and Pedro Knight in May 1992 In 1950, the band's leader, Rogelio Mart√≠nez, invited Celia Cruz, who had gained popularity for her radio performances and for breaking the color barrier with the sexy song and dance act Las Mulatas de Fuego at the Tropicana, to join the band. Over the course of six or seven years, she and Knight gradually became good friends, though she resisted his romantic advances because she feared a relationship with Knight, whom she knew enjoyed casual relationships with women and had five children at that point, would not work out. In July 1960, a year and a half after Fidel Castro came to power, La Sonora Matancera went to Mexico City to accept a two-year touring contract, but Mart√≠nez announced during a radio interview that he had no intention of returning to Cuba, a stance in which the rest of the band joined him. After 18 months, the band accepted a long-term contract at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, which entitled them to American residencies. By then, Cruz fell in love with Knight, and the couple moved to New York, where they married on July 14, 1962, after Knight abandoned his own music to become Cruz's manager, and the couple were inseparable. Commenting on their relationship, Cruz said, \\"Pedro is my 50%. I am the one that sings, but he takes care of everything else.\\" In 1963, after pressure from New York's salsa label, Fania, Knight agreed for Cruz to produce the album Celia y Johnny with musician/producer Johnny Pacheco, which began a lifelong friendship between the collaborators, and continued success for Cruz, including tours of six continents for the band in the 1970s and 1980s. By the mid-1990s, Cruz was an international star, and incorporated Knight into her performances, clasping him to her and referring to him as Mi cabecita de algodon (my little cottonhead) because of his halo of snow-white hair, and white mutton-chops. At home in Queens, New York, and later in Fort Lee, New Jersey, however, Cruz said she was a conventional Latina wife, performing errands such as cooking for him. In early 2005, he attended the opening of an exhibition dedicated to Cruz at Washington's Smithsonian Museum.\\"Pedro Knight\\". AllMusic. Retrieved November 16, 2013.

Goniatites (goniatitids) survived the Late Devonian extinction to flourish during the Carboniferous and Permian only to become extinct at the end of the Permian some 139 million years later.  Morphology  All goniatites possessed an external shell, which is divided internally into chambers filled with gas giving it buoyancy during the life of the animal. An open chamber at the front of the shell provided living space for the goniatitid animal, with access to open water through a ventral siphuncle. The general morphology and habit of goniatites was probably similar to that of their later relatives the ammonites, being free swimming and possessing a head with two well developed eyes and arms (or tentacles). Goniatite shells are small to medium in size, almost always less than in diameter and often smaller than in diameter. The shell is always planispirally coiled, unlike those of Mesozoic ammonites in which some are trochoidal and even aberrant (called heteromorphs). Goniatitid shells vary in form from thinly discoidal to broadly globular and may be smooth or distinctly ornamented. Their shape suggests many were poor swimmers. The thin walls between the internal chambers of the shell are called the septa, and as the goniatite grew it would move its body forward in the shell secreting septa behind it, thereby adding new chambers to the shell. The sutures (or suture lines) are visible as a series of narrow, wavy lines on the surface of the shell. The sutures appear where each septa contacts the wall of the outer shell. The typical goniatitid has a suture with smooth saddles and lobes, which gives the name \\"goniatitic\\" to this particular suture pattern. In some the sutures have a distinctive \\"zigzag\\" pattern. Not all goniatitid ammonoides have goniatitic sutures. In some the sutures are ceratitic, in others, even ammonitic. Nor are goniatitic sutures limited to the Goniatidia. The sutures of nautiloids are by comparison somewhat simpler, being either straight or slightly curved, whereas later ammonoids showed suture patterns of increasing complexity. One explanation for this increasing extravagancy in suture pattern is that it leads to a higher strength of the shell.  Ecology  Ecologically, goniatites were limited to environments of normal-marine salinity‚Äîas appears to be the case for all cephalopods throughout their history. Goniatites are much more abundant and speciose in sediments that represent called epicontinental seas than they are in those that represent the open ocean. Within these inland seas, goniatites' greatest abundance and diversity appears to have been achieved in deeper offshore and basinal environments rather than in nearshore environments. Known nearshore (e.g., lagoonal) occurrences have generally been ascribed to wash-in of shells from offshore waters. Due to lack of strong evidence for any particular life mode (e.g., benthic nektonic, planktonic), it remains unclear what resources goniatites were capitalizing on in these offshore environments. Only a few goniatites' full trophic apparatuses have ever been described, and reports of stomach contents in these creatures' fossils remain questionable at best. However, goniatites clearly lacked the calcified jaw apparatuses developed in later ammonites; this has been cited as evidence against their having a durophagous (shell-crushing) diet.  Distribution  Goniatites are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Australasia where they are used as index fossils in age determination and stratigraphic correlation. However, they seem to occur mostly in areas which at the time would have been tropical to subtropical. Almost any fossil-bearing limestone or shale from inland seas of the late Paleozoic tropics or subtropics is likely to yield some goniatites. In the USA, such rocks are found from Maine, New York, and Virginia and in every state west to Nebraska and south to Texas and Alabama; as well as in parts of almost every western state (with the exception of North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii). Notable goniatite occurrences are found in certain limestones in western part of Ireland (particularly Slieve Anierin) which are packed with beautifully preserved goniatite fossils. They are also found in marine bands of the Carboniferous coal measures in Europe and in marine rocks of the Pennsylvanian period in Arkansas. Large numbers of goniatites also occur in rocks from the Devonian period of Morocco.

The Tegel locality, the second largest in area (after K√∂penick) of the 96 Berlin districts, also includes the neighbourhood of Saatwinkel. History Tegel Palace The Tegel Palace (or Humboldt Palace), originally a Renaissance manor house from 1558 and a hunting lodge of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, was bequeathed to the Humboldt family in 1797. Alexander von Humboldt and Wilhelm von Humboldt lived here for several years. In 1824 Wilhelm had the palace rebuilt in a Neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In the park is a tomb, where Alexander, Wilhelm and other members of the Humboldt family are buried. From 1927 until 1931 Tegel Palace was the site of a sanatorium, founded by the psychoanalyst Ernst Simmel (1882-1947). From 1898 on Tegel was the seat of the Borsig-Werke steam locomotive manufacturing company until it moved to Hennigsdorf in Brandenburg in 1931. Between 1930 and 1934 an artillery firing range in the district was used by the Verein f√ºr Raumschiffahrt (Society for Space Travel) for experiments with liquid-fueled rockets. The principal names involved were its leader Rudolf Nebel and other staff members Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun. Tegel was the site of a medium wave broadcasting station from 1933 to 1948. A wire hung in a wooden tower served as an antenna. This tower was demolished as part of the construction of Tegel International Airport at the end of 1948. Today Humboldt island in Tegel Tegel is chiefly known for being the location of Berlin-Tegel Otto Lilienthal, Berlin's main airport. It also houses the Tegel Penitentiary, Germany's largest prison with about 1,700 inmates as of 2007, known from Alfred D√∂blin's 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz. One of Berlin's largest shopping malls Borsighallen is located in the former locomotive manufacturing halls of the Borsigwerke. There is also the Villa Borsig at the shore of Lake Tegel, the former residence of the Borsig family. Today it is a school for future diplomats. Dicke Marie (\\"Fat Mary\\") is a registered natural monument, said to be the oldest tree in Berlin Beside this Tegel is an extensive residential district with some industry. With the large Lake Tegel, set in woodlands, the locality is also a popular destination for daytrippers. It boasts Berlin's oldest tree, an oak called Dicke Marie (\\"Fat Mary\\"). Transportation Tegel is served by the Berlin S-Bahn line S25 at the station Berlin-Tegel.

It lies in the extreme northern part of the city. Frohnau is an affluent area characterized by many patrician villas from the early 20th century. During the Cold War, it was part of West Berlin.  History  Founded in 1910, Frohnau was created whole as a planned community, corresponding to the early twentieth century idea of a garden city. Frohnau was founded in the Stolper Heath, which had been bought for the Berlin Terrain Commission by Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck in 1907. The competition for the design was won by a plan developed by Joseph Brix and Felix Genzmer. Their concept represented an asymmetrical, seemingly natural development out of the dunes near the Havel River. Even the name \\"Frohnau\\" was determined by a contest. In 1920, Frohnau was annexed into the Greater Berlin city-state. Architectures Casino Tower The natural centre of the city has always been the train station and the nearby buildings. The casino tower serves as the symbol of Frohnau. The entire area is noted for its large mansion-like buildings. The architects responsible for the typical mansions include Walter and Johannes Kr√ºger (the Church of St. John), Hart and Lesser (train station and casino tower), Max Meyer (Buddhist house), Paul Poser, Max Scheidling, and Heinrich Straumer (better known for his work on Berlin's radio tower, Funkturm). Frohnau includes one of the tallest buildings in Germany: The Richtfunkmast (microwave radio tower) measures 358.6 m (1177 ft) in height and was built between 1977‚Äì1979. Until German reunification, this was the means for keeping microwave radio contact with West Germany. The receiving tower on the West German side was in Gartow, Lower Saxony. Alongside the Richtfunkmast is a 117 m (384 ft) free-standing steel framework tower, which is dwarfed in comparison. This was built between 1970 and 1973, and had 18 m (66 ft) diameter parabolic antennae to enable radio connection beyond the horizon to Lower Saxony until 1995. Since 2002 mediumwave digital radio transmissions have been tested in Frohnau at 1485 kHz. Since neither the Richtfunkmast nor the parabolic antenna tower was intended for mediumwave transmissions, an additional 10 m (33 ft) long-wire antenna was installed.

Belemnoids are an extinct group of marine cephalopod, very similar in many ways to the modern squid and closely related to the modern cuttlefish. Like them, the belemnoids possessed an ink sac,Lehmann, U. 1981. The Ammonites: Their life and their world. London: Cambridge University Press. but, unlike the squid, they possessed ten arms of roughly equal length, and no tentacles. The name \\"belemnoid\\" comes from the Greek word Œ≤Œ≠ŒªŒµŒºŒΩŒøŒΩ, belemnon meaning \\"a dart or arrow\\" and the Greek word ŒµŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ, eidos meaning \\"form\\".Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1979. Belemnoids include belemnites (which belong to order Belemnitida proper), aulacocerids (order Aulacocerida), phragmoteuthids (order Phragmoteuthida), and diplobelids (order Diplobelida). Occurrence Belemnoids were numerous during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and their fossils are abundant in Mesozoic marine rocks, often accompanying their cousins the ammonites. The belemnoids become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period along with the ammonites. The belemnoids' origin lies within the bactritoid nautiloids, which date from the Devonian period; well-formed belemnoid guards can be found in rocks dating from the Mississippian (or Early Carboniferous) onward through the Cretaceous. Other fossil cephalopods include baculites, nautiloids and goniatites. Anatomy Belemnoids possessed a central phragmocone made of aragonite and with negative buoyancy. To the rear of the creature was a heavy calcite guard whose main role appears to have been to counterbalance the front (towards the head) of the organism; it positions the centre of mass below the centre of buoyancy, increasing the stability of the swimming organism. The guard would account for between a third and a fifth of the length of the complete organism, arms included. Like some modern squid, belemnoid arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey. Belemnoids were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws. In turn, belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs, whose fossilized stomachs frequently contain phosphatic hooks from the arms of cephalopods. Ecology Belemnoids were effectively neutrally buoyant, and swam in near-shore to mid-shelf oceans. Their fins could be used to their advantage in all water speeds; in a gentle current they could be flapped for propulsion; in a stronger current they could be held erect to generate lift; and when swimming rapidly by jet propulsion they could be tucked in to the body for streamlining. Preservation mantle remnants, and arm hooks Hibolites hastatus from the Jurassic near Moneva Teruel, Spain. The barnacle borings (Rogerella) show that it spent considerable time on the seafloor after death. Normally with fossil belemnoids only the back part of the shell (called the guard or rostrum) is found. The guard is usually elongated and bullet-shaped (though in some subgroups the rostrum may only exist as a thin layer coating the phragmocone). The hollow region at the front of the guard is termed the alveolus, and this houses a chambered conical-shaped part of the shell (called the phragmocone). The phragmocone is usually only found with the better preserved specimens. Projecting forwards from one side of the phragmocone is the thin pro-ostracum. While belemnoid phragmocones are homologous with the shells of other cephalopods and are similarly composed of aragonite, belemnoid guards are evolutionarily novel and are composed of calcite or aragonite, thus tending to preserve well. Broken guards show a structure of radiating calcite fibers and may also display concentric growth rings. Diagenetic modifications of the shells are complex. Radiating calcitic crystals are thin, or very large, with a shape indicative of a strong alteration. In other samples, the aragonite - calcite boundary is not dependent on growth lines. In a given fossil sites, some specimens are calcite, others are aragonite. The guard, phragmocone and pro-ostracum were all internal to the living creature, forming a skeleton which was enclosed entirely by soft muscular tissue. The original living creature would have been larger than the fossilized shell, with a long streamlined body and prominent eyes. The guard would have been in place toward the rear of the creature, with the phragmocone behind the head and the pointed end of the guard facing backward. The guard of the belemnoid Megateuthis gigantea, which is found in Europe and Asia, can measure up to in length, giving the living animal an estimated length of . Very exceptional belemnoid specimens have been found showing the preserved soft parts of the animal. Elsewhere in the fossil record, bullet-shaped belemnite guards are locally found in such profusion that such deposits are referred to semi-formally as \\"belemnite battlefields\\" (cf. \\"orthocone orgies\\"). It remains unclear whether these deposits represent post-mating mass death events, as are common among modern cephalopods and other semelparous creatures. =Thunderstones= The name \\"thunderbolt\\" or \\"thunderstone\\" has also been traditionally applied to the fossilised rostra of belemnoids. The origin of these bullet-shaped stones was not understood, and thus a mythological explanation of stones created where lightning struck has arisen. Uses The stable isotope composition of a belemnoid rostrum from the Peedee Formation (Cretaceous, southeast USA) has long been used as a global standard (Peedee Belemnite, \\"PDB\\") against which other isotope geochemistry samples are measured, for both carbon isotopes and oxygen isotopes. Some belemnoids (such as Belemnites of Belemnitida) serve as index fossils, particularly in the Cretaceous Chalk Formation of Europe, enabling geologists to date the age the rocks in which they are found.

It is located to the south of the M√ºggelsee lake in the M√ºggelberg hills atop the Kleiner M√ºggelberg (‚ÄúSmall M√ºggelhill‚Äù). Berlin's highest natural elevation is the nearby Gro√üer M√ºggelberg at 115 m.  Access  The M√ºggelturm area can be reached from the former Marienlust restaurant to the south at the River Dahme via a footpath ending in a stairway (374 steps), or from lake M√ºggelssee in the northeast up another stairway (111 steps). From the street M√ºggelheimer Damm there is a road leading to the tower (named Stra√üe zum M√ºggelturm), but cars must be left at a parking lot a few hundred metres before the plateau.  The early towers  In 1880, Carl Spindler, owner of the K√∂penick laundry and dyeworks W. Spindler (and source of the name of the Berlin district Spindlersfeld), had a 10 m high wooden lookout tower, known as the Spindlerturm, built on the Kleiner M√ºggelberg. Because of its low height there was not much of a view and it accordingly attracted few visitors. In 1889 Spinder spent 40,000 marks to extend the tower, now 27 metres high, and choosing an architecture reminiscent of a pagoda, It opened to the public on 1 April 1890 and had a quadratic base of 5 m per side tapering to 4.2 m above the restaurant and 2.8 m at the viewing platform. This tower was also a wooden construction and had a shingled facing. The architect was Max Jacob; and the first restaurant manager was Carl Streichhahn. The enlarged tower and its restaurant rapidly became a popular excursion destination. From the platform at the top a panoramic view extended as far as 50 km on clear days and included the region's forest and lake landscape and the Berlin skyline. There were some 52,000 visitors already in its first year of operation. The historic tower around 1900 In 1924 the architect Walter Wichelhaus purchased the tower and in the following years carried out structural improvements on the Kleiner M√ºggelberg. He constructed several buildings which included a new restaurant, a kitchen, and an apartment for himself. During excavation work for these new outbuildings prehistoric relicts were found. In 1926 a new terrace with a large hall at the side was built in front of the tower. Here Wichelhaus and the M√§rkisches Museum displayed a collection entitled ‚ÄúGeschichte des M√ºggellandes und der M√ºggelberge‚Äù (‚ÄúHistory of the M√ºggel Area and the M√ºggel Hills‚Äù) with prehistoric artifacts from the M√ºggel region. Visitors could learn something about the culture of the local inhabitants during the stone age, Bronze Age and Iron Age, as well as about the Sprewanen, a Wendish tribe which lived in the Dahme-Spree region. A famous exhibit item was a molar from a mammoth. Another part of the exhibit provided the evidence that there was formerly a large hall on the Kleiner M√ºggelberg which probably served as a place of ritual worship for the Sprewanen. In 1928 two stairways were constructed up the Kleiner M√ºggelberg. In 1942 the museum's artifacts were moved to the Schmetterlingshorst restaurant, where they could be viewed there together with the world-famous butterfly collection of the restaurant's owner, B√ºttner. Both collections were destroyed in bombing raids during World War II. In 1945 as the Soviet army approached Berlin the tower was declared a military object and used as a radio transmission tower as well as an observation post for artillery units. As was the case with the Bismarck vantage point on the neighboring Gro√üer M√ºggelberg, the M√ºggel tower was to be blown up by German troops before the arrival of the advancing Soviet army. The tower restaurant proprietor Walter Wichelhaus prevented this destruction by cutting the electrical cable leading to the explosives. After the war a restaurant was again provided for visitors, and in 1956 HO K√∂penick took over operation of the M√ºggel Tower grounds. In January 1957 the M√ºggel Tower was closed because its dilapidated state made it unsafe; the following month the Berlin magistrate decided to stabilize the tower with a new foundation and the addition of a steel truss construction. As part of this work the restaurant was to be enlarged, but on the afternoon of 19 May 1958 the tower burned down completely, the probable cause being welding activities during the renovation.  Today‚Äôs tower  That same year the Berliner Zeitung launched an architectural competition for a new construction, which attracted 32 designs. These were exhibited to the public in August 1958 in the K√∂penick city hall and a month later in the newspaper's pavilion at the Friedrichstra√üe train station. The opinions expressed by visitors in a book made available for the purpose confirmed the choice of the jurors. The proposal by a student collective from the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Wei√üensee headed by J√∂rg Streitparth, Siegfried Wagner and Klaus Wei√ühaupt won the competition and after modification it formed the basis of the new construction. An oval ground plan was originally intended for the tower, but this was changed to today's quadratic form for reasons of cost. The foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1959 and on 20 August 1960 the topping out ceremony was celebrated. The tower was opened on New Year's Eve, 31 December 1961. The construction of the new M√ºggel Tower was significantly supported by public involvement and donations. As part of the German Democratic Republic's initiative calling for voluntary, charitable work (‚ÄúNationale Aufbauwerk‚Äù), the public contributed 130,000 Marks and 3,700 hours of work. The 29.61 m high tower of reinforced concrete has nine storeys with panorama windows and a platform which can be reached via 126 steps. Along with its auxiliary buildings it reflects a modern approach in contrast to the eclecticism of the previous construction and is an early example of DDR architecture in the style of socialist classicism. The gastronomy area includes a restaurant, a wine tavern and sun terraces. The new tower again became a centre of attraction for Berlin's populace, with an average of 240,000 visitors annually. Especially on holidays such as Pentecost there were large crowds in the tower and gastronomy area. A lack of maintenance effort continues to plague the area. In 1996 the tower itself was fully renovated with EU financing amounting to one million DM, but more work remains to be done. In a restaurant flower window can be found the triangulation point ‚Äú1st order M√ºggelberg,‚Äù which is important for Berlin and German geodesy as it defines the zero point of the coordinate network for Berlin topographical maps. The stone is also a memorial to Johann Jacob Baeyer (1794‚Äì1885) who was born in M√ºggelheim and is known for his role in determining central European longitude and latitude degree coordinates. He also used the M√ºggelberg hills along with measurements of the city of Berlin to determine the elevation of the immediate surroundings, such as the height of K√∂penick's St. Laurentius church and the Gosener mountains. Since the stone and its precise location as a surveying point is protected, it cannot be moved without the consent of the Berlin Senate (Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung). The M√ºggelturm in 2009  The situation after 1990 and new utilization concepts  In 1995 the city of Berlin became owner of the area and the district of K√∂penick has administered it ever since. In the same year the building on the Kleiner M√ºggelberg received the status of a listed monument. Since 2000 a number of invitations to tender have been issued in a search for an investor to develop and maintain the area. Proposals included construction of a hotel, a restaurant, and renovation of the water and power supplies, but none were accepted for various reasons. In 2007 the property was sold to an investor from Krefeld.

The tower base is currently used as radio relay link station. The tower was originally planned as the TV tower for Berlin. It was to have a total height of 425 feet (130 meters) with an observation platform at 230 feet (70 meters). After construction was started in 1954, a survey indicated that the tower would endanger aircraft on approach to the Berlin-Schoenefeld airport. For this reason, on 13 December 1955 construction was stopped. The tower base was later used by the East German Ministry for State Security (Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit or Stasi) as a listening post. Today it serves the Deutsche Telekom AG as radio relay link station and has a radar dome on its top. Close to the tower, there is a 64 metre tall lattice tower with aerials for non-public mobile radio services and directional antennas. The Berlin-M√ºggelberge TV tower is not accessible to the public and is not to be confused with the Berlin-M√ºggelberge look-out, known as the M√ºggelturm (M√ºggel tower), which is publicly accessible.

She is the daughter of English singer-songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and his late wife, American photographer, musician, and animal rights activist Linda. Like her parents, McCartney is a firm supporter of animal rights and is particularly known for her use of vegetarian and animal-free alternatives in her work. Early life McCartney was born on 13 September 1971 by Caesarean section at King's College Hospital in London,http://beatlechildren.tripod.com/stella.html. She is named after her maternal great-grandmothers (both of Linda's grandmothers were named Stella). As a girl, McCartney travelled the globe with her parents and their group Wings, along with her siblings: older half-sister Heather (who was legally adopted by ex-Beatle Paul), older sister Mary, and younger brother James. According to her father, the name of Wings was inspired by Stella's difficult delivery. As his daughter was being born by emergency caesarean section, Paul sat outside the operating room and prayed that she be born 'on the wings of an angel'. Her mother was Jewish.https://forward.com/culture/186536/secret- history-of-paul-mccartney-the-jewish-beatle/ Despite their fame, the McCartneys wanted their children to lead as normal a life as possible, so Stella and her siblings attended local state schools in East Sussex, one of them being Bexhill College. McCartney has said that while attending state school, she was a victim of bullying, and had been a bully herself. Career =Beginning= McCartney became interested in designing clothes as a youth. At the age of 13, she designed her first jacket. Three years later, she interned for Christian Lacroix, working on her first haute couture collection, honing her skills working for Edward Sexton (her father's Savile Row tailor) for a number of years. McCartney studied her foundation at Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication, followed by Fashion Design at Central Saint Martins in the early 1990s, graduating in 1995. Her graduation collection was modelled for free by friends and supermodels Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon and Kate Moss, at the graduation runway show, presented to a song especially written by her father, \\"Stella May Day\\". A lifelong vegetarian, McCartney uses no leather or fur in her designs. The Guardian described her in 2015 as a 'consistent and vocal' supporter of animal rights. Some of McCartney's designs have text that elaborates on her 'no animal' policy; one of her Adidas jackets carries a sleeve that says 'suitable for sporty vegetarians'. A pair of her vinyl and ultrasuede boots were marketed specifically as vegan-friendly, though her use of oil-based synthetics still raised ecological concerns. Stella McCartney's store in West Hollywood In 2001, McCartney launched a fashion house under her name, in a joint venture with Gucci Group (now Kering), and presented her first collection in Paris. She now operates 51 freestanding stores in Manhattan's Soho, London's Mayfair, LA's West Hollywood, Paris's Palais Royal, Barcelona's Passeig de Gracia, Milan, Rome, Miami and Houston, among other locations. In 2003, McCartney launched her first perfume, Stella. In January 2007, she launched a 100% organic skincare line, CARE, which includes seven products, from a cleansing milk made with lemon balm and apricot, to green tea and linden blossom floral water. In 2008, McCartney launched a new lingerie line. In November 2010, the Stella McCartney Kids collection was launched for newborns and children up to age 12. In June 2012, McCartney invited the Soul Rebels Brass Band to perform at her 2013 spring fashion presentation at the New York Marble Cemetery in New York City. Other guests invited to the party included Anne Hathaway, Jim Carrey, Anna Wintour, Annie Leibovitz, Lauren Hutton, Amy Poehler, Solange Knowles, P'Trique, Greta Gerwig and Andr√© Leon Talley. Also in 2012, McCartney was part of The Sustainable Fashion Handbook. In November 2016, McCartney launched her first menswear collection, made up of many athleisure, pyjama- like casual outfits. She said her father had inspired the collection. In April 2018, after 17 years of partnership with Kering, McCartney decided to purchase its stake of her company and take the reins of her global fashion empire. She designed the wedding reception dress worn by Meghan Markle, and later created 46 replicas of it (23 in lily white and 23 in onyx black) for her \\"Made With Love\\" capsule collection, each priced at ¬£3,500. On 15 October 2018, McCartney announced the launch of the \\"Stella McCartney Cares Foundation\\", a charity dedicated to breast cancer. (She lost her mother to the disease in 1998.) The charity will donate 1,000 of the brand's Louis Listening post-operative mastectomy compression bras to women undergoing breast cancer treatment. =Collaborations= \\"Stella McCartney\\" branded dress worn by Caroline Wozniacki at the 2010 US Open. McCartney launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation in September 2004. This was a sports performance collection for women. In January 2010, McCartney announced she would be collaborating with Disney to create a jewellery collection inspired by Alice in Wonderland. In July of the same year, together with PETA and eco-designer Atom cianfarani, McCartney worked to petition the British Ministry of Defence to cease the use of Canadian Black Bears as the fur for their guards' hats; the military is yet to make the change. In July 2011, McCartney participated at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.TV Fashion Runway Show , The Brandery Catwalk In December 2018, McCartney announced to launch a new fashion industry charter for climate action, in collaboration with the United Nations, to help fashion companies welcome sustainable business practices. In August 2019, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift teamed up with McCartney to release a fashion line inspired by Swift's seventh studio album Lover, the project carrying the title \\"Stella X Taylor Swift\\". =Team GB= In September 2010, McCartney was appointed Team GB's Creative Director for the 2012 Olympics by Adidas ‚Äî the first time in the games' history that a leading fashion designer designed the apparel for a country's team across all competitions for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. In March 2012, the Team GB kit was publicly displayed. McCartney continued in this role for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Awards and media McCartney received the VH1/Vogue Designer of the Year award in 2000 in New York. Her father Paul presented the award to her; she thanked him in her acceptance speech and dedicated the award to her late mother Linda. This was followed by the Woman of Courage Award for work against cancer at the prestigious Unforgettable Evening event (2003, Los Angeles), the Glamour Award for Best Designer of the Year (2004, London), the Star Honoree at the Fashion Group International Night of the Stars (2004, New York), the Organic Style Woman of the Year Award (2005, New York), the Elle Style Award for Best Designer of the Year Award (2007, London), Best Designer of the Year at the British Style Awards (2007, London), Best Designer of The Year at the Spanish Elle Awards (2008, Barcelona), and the Green Designer of the Year at the ACE Awards (2008, New York).

In November 2011, she was presented with the Red Carpet Award by the British Fashion Council; and in the 2013 New Year Honours, she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to fashion. In 2012, McCartney was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his artwork ‚Äì the album cover for The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ‚Äì to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. In February 2013 she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. In June 2017, McCartney was the guest for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Her choices included \\"Road to Nowhere\\" by Talking Heads and \\"Blackbird\\" by the Beatles. Her favourite was \\"God Only Knows\\" by the Beach Boys. She would later receive the Special Recognition Award for Innovation at the 2017 Fashion Awards Personal life McCartney married British publisher Alasdhair Willis on 30 August 2003 at Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute. Her wedding dress was an updated version of her mother's wedding dress from 1969. Willis works as creative director of shoewear brand Hunter Boot Ltd. In 2015, he was named one of GQs 50 best-dressed British men. McCartney and Willis have four children: sons Miller Alasdhair James Willis (born 2005) and Beckett Robert Lee Willis (born 2008) and daughters Bailey Linda Olwyn Willis (born 2006) and Reiley Dilys Stella Willis (born 2010).\\"Stella McCartney Welcomes Daughter Reiley Dilys\\", People, 29 November 2010. McCartney has a younger half-sister, Beatrice Milly McCartney, born on 28 October 2003 to her father and his second wife, Heather Mills. In 2018, McCartney said: 'When my mum died, Dad, my brother and I went to see the Maharishi... I had quite a reaction that I didn't feel in control of. I possibly suppressed my emotions and I started having panic attacks, physical reactions to that loss.' She said that Transcendental meditation made an almost instantaneous difference in her ability to cope. 'It really did help me at a time when I really needed some help... I didn't want to part with money for it. But, you know, it's probably the best investment I ever made.'

Etzenricht has 1721 inhabitants and various small industries. East of Etzenricht toward Rothenstadt is a transformer station of the E.ON AG with the GKK Etzenricht (described below) and a large compressor station for natural gas. Near Etzenricht are numerous fish-rich small waters, which can be used by anglers after obtaining a fishing license from the local fishery association. History Etzenricht was mentioned for the first time in a written document in 1270. In 1283 it was mentioned in the Salbuch of Louis II (\\"Ludwig der Strenge\\" as \\"Aechswinreuth\\". The inhabitants of Etzenricht lived at that time on honey production and agriculture. The Reformer Jan Huss visited Etzenricht in 1414, on his way to the council of Konstanz. During the war from 1618 to 1648 Etzenricht was destroyed in 1631. In 1875, a railway was built and the town got its own railway station in 1877. Until the completion of the Catholic Church in 1932, Evangelical and Catholic services in Etzenricht took place in the same church. A transformer station of the Bayernwerk AG (now E.ON AG) was built near Etzenricht and was expanded several times in subsequent years. A HVDC back-to-back facility called GKK Etzenricht was installed there from 1991 to 1993, which made the name of the municipality Etzenricht supraregionally popular.

The company was founded in 1984 as a division of B√©n√©teau group, a major sailboat manufacturer. Production moved to a new custom-built factory in September 2000. In September 2008, Microcar was acquired by Ligier Automobiles in a deal backed by the Italian private equity firm 21 Investimenti Partners. The merger created Europe's second- biggest manufacturer of microcars, and largest maker of quadricycles, or \\"sans permis\\" (license-exempt) vehicles. The Microcar and Ligier brands are to retain their separate identities and production facilities. Phillipe Ligier, son of company founder Guy Ligier, is CEO of the expanded Ligier Automobiles.  Current models  Microcar M.Go Electric at the 2008 Paris Motor Show The current model range consists of the M.GO-3, introduced (in 2015?) to replace M.Go model introduced in 2009. There are six trim levels, all with petrol engines, in the UK. The M.Go was available in conventional, diesel-engined S, S PACK, MICA, SXI, and Sport trim levels, as well as full electric. Prior to the M.Go, Microcar was known for their long-running MC Series models, sold as the MC1 and MC2. Both where available as a 2-seat, or 4-seat long wheel base version. The long wheel base being 40mm longer than the short Virgo models. The company also sold a small commercial vehicle called the Sherpa, which was a badge-engineered Ligier X-Pro.
