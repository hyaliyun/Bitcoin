They are an national minority recognized by the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Albanians came to Bosnia in various historical periods. During Ottoman times many Albanians came to work or rule as pashas, and in modern time they came as seasonal workers, war refugees or sportspeople. Many people descended from earlier waves of Albanian migration bear surnames of linguistically Albanian origin, but do not speak the language and are not considered to be Albanians therefore the number of 2800 seems a bit lower than expected. History =Ottoman rule= Albanians first settled in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of Ottoman rule, with the main causes being economic, political and social. Most of them came from northern Albania. In Bosnia and Herzegovina they lived as shepherds, farmers, craftsmen, border guards, and soon assimilated with the locals. Many young Albanians married Bosnian women and thus joined the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The men did not return to their homeland and built a new life in Bosnia. This is also confirmed by the record of the Mount Koritnik's name of the Tragedy. The people of the Kukes region followed the Gurbits up to Koritnik and separated from their grieving relatives there, then continued on to Prizren. =Habsburg rule= With the arrival of the Austro-Hungarians the number of Albanians decreased, due to further exile in Europe, whose doors became more open. Thus, in the 1910 census, only 273 Albanian-speaking Bosnian and Herzegovina residents were registered. =Kingdom of Yugoslavia= But during the time of the first and especially the second Yugoslavia, again a large number of Albanians, due to the difficult living conditions in the countries in which they lived (Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia), settled in Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly in the cities: Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Banja Luka, Doboj, Brcko, Bijelina, Mostar and Trebinje. By 1930 the number of Albanians in Bosnia and Herzegovina had almost quadrupled, and according to the 1991 census, there were about 5,000 Albanians in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The then Albanian exiles in Bosnia and Herzegovina were mainly engaged in bakery, confectionery, jewelry and other crafts. =Socialist Yugoslavia and War in Bosnia and Herzegovina= Most Albanians traditionally lived in Sarajevo. In 1970‚Äì1981, in Sarajevo, there was a primary school in Albanian, the \\"Bane ≈†urbat\\" school in Grbavica. During the Siege of Sarajevo, a high number of Albanians fled from Sarajevo, largely because of Ratko Mladiƒá's threats, with messages often aired on television that no Albanian would leave Sarajevo alive. Demographics In the 1910 census there were recorded 273 Albanian speaking people Arbanasi people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 2013 Bosnian census, there were 2,656 Albanians living in Bosnia, with another 150 people who declared themselves as Shqiptar, Kosovars, Illyrian-Albanian, Bosnian-Albanian etc. to a total of 2806 people or 0.08% of total population.

Since its opening, the center has hosted more than 38 major exhibits and served more than 895,000 customers. It is the sixth-largest library in the Broward County Library System and the third of its kind in the nation. =History= Samuel F. Morrison, while director of the Broward County Libraries Division, was inspired to build an ethnically-focused library after a visit to the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History. At that time, the Auburn Avenue Research Library and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City were the only two research libraries in African-American culture in the nation. Morrison, however, was determined to \\"build a library in the African-American area, with county funds.\\" =Funding= Between 1990 and 1995, Morrison engaged in numerous conversations and negotiations with county officials on the construction of the library. Funds had already been saved to replace the smaller Von D. Mizell Branch Library in Fort Lauderdale. The Broward County Commission had provided the land and $5 million towards the new library. Morrison, however, had plans for a much larger library and research facility and needed and additional $7 million to complete his vision. The remaining funds were received largely through fundraising. A $600,000 grant was issued by the National Endowment for the Humanities and was matched by other organizations and philanthropists, such as the Sun-Sentinel, Blockbuster Entertainment Group, and Dianne and Michael Bienes. $50,000 was donated by The Links and $250,000 donated by Publix Charities. Businessman, Wayne Huizenga donated $1 million towards the library. Additional funds were raised from churches, clubs, and other interested organizations. =Construction= The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on October 23, 1999. After additional fundraising, construction of the building began in April 2001. PAWA Complex International ‚Äì the largest African-American owned architectural company in Florida ‚Äì created the architectural design of the facility. Cecil Hayes ‚Äì the first African American listed in the Architectural Digest top 100 ‚Äì created the building's interior design and the artistic designer was Gary Moore. According to Morrison, over 50 percent of the construction contracts were done by African-American corporations. On October 26, 2002, construction of the AARLCC was complete and finally opened to the public.

He was ranked 18th in the world for the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour at the time of his death.  Early life  Mason Lowe was born in Springfield, Missouri, on September 12, 1993, to Stacy Lowe and Melissa Reed. He grew up in Exeter, Missouri. His interest in bull riding started as a toddler; when he was three years old he rode the milk calves on his family farm. He participated in junior rodeos, and skipped high school rodeos to enter the amateur bull riding aged fifteen, competing throughout the Midwest. About this choice, he said he sometimes regretted not participating at high school level, but also believed that he was more prepared for professional tours thanks to the amateur competitions. Watching the PBR growing up, he named Chris Shivers as his role model.  Professional career  Lowe got his PBR card as soon as he turned eighteen, and started participating in tour circuits in the 2015 season, where he advanced to the PBR World Finals and earned $102,000. In his initial competitions, he was placed at 164th in the world. He suffered a wrist injury between seasons, in the summer of 2016. At the start of his second season, he was considered one of the talented up-and-coming riders in contention with the veteran riders. It was at the start of this season in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, that he got his first 90-point ride, staying on Bruiser for 91 points. Towards the middle of his second season he had a run without placing in the top ten in six straight competitions, but in the seventh competition, he placed first at Albuquerque, taking his first win at a Built Ford Tough Series competition. After that, he did not compete over the winter, spending time in California to prevent injury, and returned in February 2017 at the Sprint Center in his home state of Missouri, being ranked 12th in the world at the start of 2017. At the Iron Cowboy competition in February 2017 at the AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Lowe became only the second rider to complete a ride on Smooth Operator in competition, with a 90.75 point ride, moving to 9th in world rankings. In early June 2017 he suffered a small injury from a completed ride, leaving him limping for a while but not interfering with his competition schedule. He won his next ride with another 8-second stay in the two-round competition, at the 14th J.W. Hart PBR Challenge. This feat moved him up to be 11th in the world. In the 2017 season he earned over $110,000 but by the start of the 2018 season, he had dropped back to be ranked 14th in the world. Lowe always enjoyed competing near home. He qualified for the PBR World Finals three times (2015-17) but failed to qualify in 2018, his last full season.Mason Lowe - Bull Rider Profile / Stats  Death  Lowe was competing in a PBR Velocity Tour event at the Denver Coliseum as part of the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado on January 15, 2019, and was thrown from his bull. However, the bull ‚Äî Hard Times ‚Äî then turned and his back legs stepped hard on his chest before moving off. Eyewitness reports say he did stand, then grasped his chest before collapsing. He was treated at Denver Health Medical Center but died from extensive damage to his heart, heart valve, and aorta, the 1-ton bull crushing his chest even though he was wearing a protective vest. The competition was postponed to the next day, with all riders wearing memorial patches. The PBR sent support to his wife, Abbey, who have said that Hard Times will stay in competition because they believe the injury was done \\"absolutely unintentionally\\". He was the third bull rider to be killed in competition since the PBR was founded. In his memory, the PBR temporarily renamed their annual Premier Series event at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri, the Mason Lowe Memorial for the 2019 season. Since 2019, the PBR‚Äôs Touring Pro Division has held the annual Ridin‚Äô with Mason Lowe memorial event in Cassville, Missouri. Personal life Lowe was well-known for being a cowboy. On June 9, 2018, he married Abbey Cooper in Pilot Grove, Missouri. They lived in Rocheport, Missouri, with their dog Gator. After his death on January 15, 2019, Lowe left behind a widow, Abbey, and other family.

The name derives from the shape of the evolutionary track on a Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram which forms a loop towards the blue (i.e. hotter) side of the diagram. Blue loops can occur for red supergiants, red giant branch stars, or asymptotic giant branch stars. Some stars may undergo more than one blue loop. Many pulsating variable stars such as Cepheids are blue loop stars. Stars on the horizontal branch are not generally referred to as on a blue loop even though they are temporarily hotter than on the red giant or asymptotic giant branches. Loops occur far too slowly to be observed for individual stars, but are inferred from theory and from the properties and distribution of stars in the H‚ÄìR diagram. Red giants Stellar evolutionary tracks, some showing blue loops in the more massive red giants Most stars on the red giant branch (RGB) have an inert helium core and remain on the RGB until a helium flash moves them to the horizontal branch. However, stars more massive than about do not have an inert core. They smoothly ignite helium before reaching the tip of the red-giant branch and become hotter while they burn helium in their cores. More massive stars become hotter during this phase and stars from about upwards are generally treated as experiencing a blue loop, which lasts on the order of a million years. This type of blue loop occurs only once in the lifetime of a star. Asymptotic giant branch Stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) have largely inert cores of carbon and oxygen, and alternately fuse hydrogen and helium in concentric shells around the core. The onset of helium shell burning causes a thermal pulse and in some cases this will cause the star to temporarily increase its temperature and execute a blue loop. Many thermal pulses may occur as the shells alternately switch on and off, and multiple blue loops can occur in the same star. Red supergiants Red supergiants are massive stars that have left the main sequence and greatly expanded and cooled. Their high luminosity and low surface gravity means they are rapidly losing mass. The most luminous red supergiants can lose mass quickly enough that they become hotter and smaller. In the most massive stars, this can result in the star evolving permanently away from the red supergiant stage to become a blue supergiant, but in some cases the star will execute a blue loop and return to being a red supergiant. Instability strip Stars which are executing blue loops cross the yellow portion of the H‚ÄìR diagram above the main sequence, so that many of them cross a region called the instability strip because the outer layers of stars in that region are unstable and pulsate. Stars from the asymptotic giant branch that cross the instability strip during a blue loop are thought to become W Virginis variables. More massive stars, crossing the instability strip during a blue loop from the red giant branch, are thought to make up the Œ¥ Cephei variables. Both types of star have luminous and unstable photospheres at this stage of their lives and often have the spectra of supergiants, although most are not massive enough to ever fuse carbon or reach a supernova.

Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). Between when that list was compiled and mid-July 2020, one species has been added from eBird. The combined list contains 197 species. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags are used to highlight the abundance of some species. Species without tags are common to abundant residents, migrants, or seasonal visitors. *(Uc) Uncommon - \\"Likely to be seen monthly in appropriate habitat and season. May be locally common\\" per the NPS *(R) Rare - \\"Present, but usually seen only a few times each year\\" per the NPS *(O) Occasional - \\"Occurs in the park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year\\" per the NPS *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to North America by the actions of man, either directly or indirectly Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Founded in 2013, the side took part in three consecutive Papua New Guinea National Soccer League seasons starting in 2014 before splitting from the division and joining the National Premier League ahead of the 2017 season. The side have struggled to find success in these competitions, however, having failed in all five previous seasons to qualify for the championship playoffs.  History  In late 2013, it was reported that a side with the name of Admiralty FC were one of two new teams ahead of the 2014 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season. The side is owned by an arm of the Manus Provincial Government, Admiralty Peliau Limited, which is 100 percent owned by the people of Manus. To cut down on travel costs, the side based themselves in Port Moresby for the entirety of the season. The side opened their season with a 1‚Äì1 draw against Oro FC, before being beaten by reigning champions Hekari United, who thumped them 6‚Äì0. However, they registered their first NSL victory on 22 February 2014 with a 3‚Äì0 win against Eastern Stars, with Stars having a man sent off and Solomon Islands import Moffat Kilifa opening the scoring for the debutants. Despite a final day 3‚Äì1 victory over Besta PNG United on 10 May, the victory was only their second of the season, and they finished fifth in the regular season table, failing to qualify for the playoffs. Admiralty were confirmed as having fully registered for the 2015 season as early as July 2014, and had a solid start to the season, drawing three of their opening four matches, including a scoreless draw against champions Hekari. However, narrow defeats to Lae City Dwellers and Besta PNG United saw the side go into the halfway stage bottom of the league with just three points. However, in the second half of the season, they lost once, against Hekari, and managed to pick up wins against Besta PNG United, FC Port Moresby and Madang FC to finish 5th overall. The side were confirmed for the 2015‚Äì16 season in October 2015, and were drawn into the Northern Zone alongside newly-crowned champions Lae City Dwellers, Morobe FC, Madang FC, Besta PNG United, and newcomers Goroka Gosiha. The side based themselves in Lae for the season. The side were unable to win a match until the fourth round of fixtures, when they were able to pick up a 3‚Äì0 win against newcomers Goroka Gosiha. This sent them on a run of form, defeating Besta PNG 3‚Äì0 and drawing their next two matches before losing their first game in six on 24 January 2016 against Lae City Dwellers, going down 2‚Äì1. Another win and a draw saw them finish in 4th place in the regional zone, with only the top two qualifying for the playoffs. In February 2017, the Manus Football Association, of which Admiralty were a part, broke away from the Papua New Guinea Football Association (PNGFA) alongside ten other governing bodies across the country, and realigned themselves with the Football Federation Papua New Guinea (FFPNG). As part of the new body, the side successfully applied to compete in the inaugural season of the Papua New Guinea National Premier League, and were drawn into the Southern Conference, alongside Hekari United and four other teams. The side once again relocated, back to Port Moresby, ahead of the new season. The side suffered a heavy 11‚Äì0 defeat in their opening fixture against Gigira Amoana, but recovered the following week with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Rapatona. The side continued to have a poor defensive record, conceding 29 goals in ten games, but managed to win three games, which placed them 4th in the Southern Zone table at the end of the season. This was not enough to qualify for the playoffs. The club returned for the 2018 season as one of four teams in the Southern Conference. In a shortened season, each club played each other just once, with Admiralty picking up one win from three ‚Äì a 4‚Äì1 win over Gigira Amoana ‚Äì to finish third. In December 2018, following the reunification of the two governing bodies, it was announced that Admiralty would be making a return to the National Soccer League, and would be drawn into the Islands Conference. However, in January, the PNGFA announced that the club had failed to secure funding from the Manus government, and as such would not be entering the 2019 season.

The series premiered in the United States on The CW on October 10, 2012, with international broadcasting taking place in late 2012 and primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Arrow follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on Lian Yu, a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to Starling City (later renamed \\"Star City\\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others in his quest, among them former soldier John Diggle (David Ramsey), I.T. expert and skilled hacker Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards), former assassin Sara Lance (Caity Lotz), aspiring vigilante Roy Harper (Colton Haynes), Oliver's sister Thea (Willa Holland), and attorney-turned-vigilante Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy). The group also receives support from Laurel and Sara's father Officer Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks, which highlight parallels from Oliver's history that shape events in the main story. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children William and Mia, exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy. The following is a list of recurring and significant guest characters who have appeared in the television series, listed in alphabetical order by surname; for a list of main characters see List of Arrow characters. Many of the characters appearing in the series are based on DC Comics characters. Overview A =Kazumi Adachi= Kazumi Adachi (portrayed by Jeanie Cloutier) is the mother of Emiko Queen, born out of an affair Kazumi had with Robert Queen. Prior to the events of the seventh season, Kazumi is murdered by Kodiak of the Longbow Hunters. The hit was ordered by Dante, who wanted Emiko to be strong enough to lead the Ninth Circle and viewed her relationship with her mother as a weakness. =Cecil Adams / The Count / Count Vertigo= Cecil Adams / The Count / Count Vertigo (portrayed by Seth Gabel) is the dealer of the deadly narcotic known as Vertigo. Having already hated The Count for his sister Thea's Vertigo addiction, Oliver kills the drug lord in season two when The Count is holding Felicity hostage. In the fifth season's episode, \\"Kapiushon\\", his real name is revealed to be Cecil Adams. =Onyx Adams= Onyx Adams (portrayed by Chastity Dotson) is a former League of Assassins member and a former CIA black ops member. =Ruv√© Adams= Ruv√© Adams (portrayed by Janet Kidder) is the wife of Damien Darhk who shares his ambitions and campaigns against Oliver for mayor of Star City. She wins the election and becomes mayor after Oliver drops out of the race. She is held captive by Lonnie Machin, who stabs her in the chest with an arrow. Unable to move, she is crushed by falling debris from the destruction of Darhk's nuclear bomb shelter. Before she dies, she asks Oliver to save her daughter. =Barry Allen / Flash (Earth-1)= Barry Allen / Flash (portrayed by Grant Gustin) is a young crime scene investigator from the Central City Police Department. Oliver first meets Barry when the latter arrives to personally investigate a superhuman-related crime in Starling City. Barry discovers that Oliver is his vigilante idol, the Arrow, saves Oliver's life and helps him to begin uncovering the Mirakuru plot orchestrated by Slade Wilson. Ultimately, both Barry and Oliver become good friends and they occasionally offer each other advice and support.

The campaign launched on January 13, 2019 with the digital release of a short film entitled We Believe: The Best Men Can Be, which played upon the previous slogan (\\"The Best a Man Can Get\\") to address supposed negative behavior among men, including bullying, sexism, sexual misconduct, and toxic masculinity. The campaign includes a three-year commitment by Gillette to make donations to organizations that \\"[help men] achieve their personal best\\". The release of the initial short film was the subject of controversy and was received negatively by various online commentators, becoming one of the most disliked videos on YouTube. The campaign has led to calls to boycott Gillette and Procter & Gamble. The company reported a $5.24 billion loss, driven by a $8 billion charge on its Gillette shaving business later in 2019. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/31/gillettes-toxic-masculinity- ad-haunts-pg-as-shavin/  Synopsis  The introductory short film for the campaign, We Believe: The Best Men Can Be, directed by Kim Gehrig, begins by invoking the brand's slogan since 1989, \\"The Best a Man Can Get\\", by asking \\"is this the best a man can get?\\" This is followed by scenes demonstrating negative behavior among males, including bullying, sexism, sexual misconduct, and toxic masculinity, acknowledgement of social movements such as #MeToo, and footage of actor Terry Crews stating during Congress testimony that men \\"need to hold other men accountable\\". The ad continues on to explain that \\"we believe in the best in men: To say the right thing, to act the right way\\", since \\"the boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow.\\" As a result, the original slogan is re-worked to reinforce this message, becoming \\"The Best Men Can Be\\". This campaign includes a companion website, and a pledge by Gillette to donate $1 million per-year over the next three years to organizations, such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America, that \\"[help men] achieve their personal best\\". In the aforementioned website, Gillette explains the campaign by stating that \\"as a company that encourages men to be their best, we have a responsibility to make sure we are promoting positive, attainable, inclusive and healthy versions of what it means to be a man.\\" Reception Upon its introduction, the advertisement received praise and criticism on social media while quickly becoming one of the most disliked videos on YouTube. Gillette was applauded by some for addressing current social issues and promoting positive values among men. For example, Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., described the \\"We Believe\\" film as being \\"pro-humanity\\" and demonstrating \\"that character can step up to change conditions\\". However, the advertisement faced criticism and threats of boycotts from critics who said that it emasculated men and who disagreed with its message. British journalist and television personality Piers Morgan described the campaign as \\"a direct consequence of radical feminists\\" who are \\"driving a war against masculinity\\". Regarding their embrace of \\"woke culture\\" and corporate responsibility, Josh Barro of New York magazine compared the ad unfavorably to a recent Nike campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, arguing that Nike's ad was successful since it was \\"uplifting rather than accusatory\\", and consistent with Nike's values as representing \\"bold action ‚Äî on and off the field\\", but that in regards to Gillette's ad, \\"the viewer is likely to ask: Who is Gillette to tell me this? I just came here for razors. And razors barely even feature in Gillette's new campaign.\\" However, Barro noted that the market for razors was different from that of sporting goods, and that consumers \\"may be less likely to abandon a product because they feel accused by the brand when their emotional relationship to the brand wasn‚Äôt the point to begin with.\\" Writing for the National Review, Mona Charen noted that despite criticism to the advertisement coming from other conservatives, and \\"undercurrents\\" of \\"feminist influence\\" (such as the term \\"toxic masculinity\\"), she found that its imagery \\"didn't strike me as a reproof of masculinity per se but rather as a critique of bullying, boorishness, and sexual misconduct\\", and pointed out that \\"by reflexively rushing to defend men in this context, some conservatives have run smack into an irony. Imagining themselves to be men's champions, they are actually defending behavior, like sexual harassment and bullying, that a generation or two ago conservatives were the ones condemning.\\" Andrew P. Street expressed a similar argument, considering the negative responses to the ad to be \\"a living document of how desperately society needs things like the [ad]\\", and that \\"if your masculinity is THAT threatened by an ad that says we should be nicer then you're doing masculinity wrong.\\" Anne Kingston of Maclean's felt that Gillette's parent company Procter & Gamble should have instead focused on addressing gender equality within its board, and gender- based price discrimination, concluding by hoping that \\"by the time both the boys and girls of today grow up, we'll have exposed and shaved away the pernicious inequities in full display on drugstore shelves. Gillette missed its opportunity. Someone smarter won't.\\" Defending the campaign, P&G; CEO David S. Taylor stated that \\"the world would be a better place if my board of directors on down is represented by 50% of the women. We sell our products to more than 50% of the women.\\" The Wall Street Journal noted the company's board of directors has more than twice as many men as it does women. Marketing Week claimed the ad backfired on the brand and affected sales metrics.https://www.marketingweek.com/2019/01/18/gillette-brand-takes-hit-as- metoo-ad-backfires/ In his video WOKE BRANDS, YouTuber and cultural critic Harry Brewis argued that the advertisement's intention was, in fact, to generate controversy, as a form of outrage marketing. #MyBestSelf In May 2019, Gillette released a video on Facebook and Instagram entitled \\"First Shave\\" as part of a follow-up campaign, \\"#MyBestSelf\\", which features the story of a recently-transitioned trans man learning to shave from his father. The ad subverted the Gillette slogan, this time by making it inclusive of gender identity. In contrast to \\"We Believe\\", the advertisement was generally praised for its acknowledgement of the transgender community.

Career in France  Wang was entrusted by Langevin with the research on ionization of particles suspended in the atmosphere, a domain in which Langevin himself had abundantly researched at the turn of the 20th Century for his own doctoral thesis, and in which the world of scientists were increasingly interested for its utility in meteorology and radio-electronics. From 1934 to 1940, Wang published 9 scientific papers and completed the task with his French state doctoral thesis on the Electrization of the Particles Suspended in the gas. Langevin performed a complementary calculation on the results obtained by Wang on a roll of toilet paper when he was secretly imprisoned during 38 days by the Gestapo and then, he reviewed a part of Wang's thesis when he was under house arrest by the end of 1940. Wang's new discoveries on the equilibrium between big and small ions of suspended particles in the gases, as well as the equation he obtained between the numbers of big/small ions and the mobility of small ions, confirmed and completed later by another French scientist J. Bricard in 1948, was referred to as \\"Langevin-Ouang-Bricard\\" theory by the geophysical science community in the 1950s. In 1939, shortly after France and U.K. declared war against Nazi Germany, while all the Langevin laboratories at ESPCI was converted to the Research Group IV of the National Defense Ministry, Wang worked on multiplying the emission power of the ultrasonics submarine detector - known as Sonar today - that Langevin invented by the end of World War I using piezoelectric quartz crystals transducer. Wang succeeded to increase its power per unit area by applying sintering process, which improved greatly the efficiency and the reliability of the active sonar system. The technology was transferred to the UK Royal Navy for immediate implementation. Wang has also succeeded to put together an acoustic system capable of dispersing the heavy fog on military airports by creating large amplitude sound waves using a series of high air pressure Hartmann whistles causing the dispersal of particles suspended in the air. A profound friendship was built up between Ouang and Langevin beyond their student-teacher relationship. During the World War II, while Langevin was under home arrest, Wang refused to work for ESPCI led by a pro-German director Jean Thibaud and joined Ir√®ne and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie - also student of Paul Langevin - at their Institute du Radium, where he researched more in radioactivity until the liberation of Paris by allied forces and the return of Langevin to ESPCI. From that point to the middle of 1950s, while continuing the research in ionized gases based on Langevin's theory and his previous work, Wang made breakthroughs in the following domains: # Inventing high sensibility electrometers; # Measuring the absorption, dispersion and speed of ultrasound in fluid; # Proving the existence of negative electrophoresis discovered by Felix Ehrenhaft; # Using Œ≤ ray to measure and control the thickness of emulsion on photo film and paper. Wang, Joliot-Curie and Biquard families in summer 1941 After the war, Wang was awarded with the Prix Hughes by the Academie des Sciences in 1945 for his contribution in the field of ionized gases; and was promoted by Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) from researcher to research director. In 1947, by the recommendation of Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, he was appointed consultant to the Commisariat √† l'Energie Atomique (CEA). He has also been working as scientific consultant for some private companies in France and in the U.K., la Soci√©t√© Quartz and Silice among others. Influenced by Langevin and Joliot-Curie, both French communist party members, as well as the communist dominant French Resistance movement during the german occupation of the WWII, Wang was also involved in the social life in Paris. In 1949 he was elected president of Association of Chinese students in France - a progressive association regrouping the left-wing Chinese students - disbanded in the fall 1952 by the French government under the global anti-communist waves and at the request of the Republic of China's government withdrawn to Taiwan in the late 1940s.  Career in China  Wang Dezhao and students in the early 1980s. With his sympathy for the communist movement in China, Wang moved back to People's Republic of China in 1956, seven years after the communists took control and seven years before France formally recognized it. Wang's return to China, as the return of many other western-educated scientists at the same period, was highly anticipated and celebrated by the highest level communist leaders, they saw on him the key to build up a crucial part of the young regime's national defense system - sonar - dubbed as ‚Äúthe underwater great wall\\". Wang entered the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where he was elected as academician in 1957, served as associate director of Institute of Electronics in charge of the underwater acoustics research. In 1964, he helped set up the Institute of Acoustics (IOA) and served as its director. Approved by the Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, 100 undergraduate students were picked by CAS even before their graduation from three most prestigious colleges of the time - Peking University, Tsinghua University and Che Kiang University - to form Wang Dezhao's research team. Wang wrote textbooks, trained the young team personally and set the stage for their research career, while leading the experiments on and under the South China Sea. Wang survived the Culture Revolution (1966-1976) during which the IOA was dismantled, while himself was deprived of all positions and subjected to humiliations, confiscation of property, tortures, custody. After Deng Xiaoping seized power in the aftermath of Mao's era in 1977, Wang wrote a long letter urging Deng to put the IOA and his team back on track. He obtained an immediate favorable response. Through his retirement in 1984, Wang supported his students to succeed in various basic research subjects, among others : # on the normal mode theory; # on the theory of horizontal coherence of signal field in shallow water; # on the relationship between sound field and bottom- reflection-loss in shallow water; # on the theory of turning-point convergence-zones in deep underwater sound channels in the South China Sea; # on the effects of internal waves on the underwater sound propagation. In addition, a series of advanced defense and civil sonar products were also developed. One of the most important was the Bottom-Fixed Underwater Acoustic Surveillance System designed, developed and manufactured by Wang and his students. Along with scientific papers, Wang has authored with his students English-Chinese, French-Chinese scientific lexicons of acoustical terms and, in 1981, a treatise entitled Underwater Acoustics. Wang served several terms as representative in China's National People's Congress and as member in standing committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the 1980s, he re-established the Association of Old Students from France and served as Chairman for one term; he also petitioned to create the Middle School affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, known as Zhongguancun Middle School today, and served as honorific head of school.

The trails are located on the Notschrei (1,119 m above NHN), which is a pass between the villages of Oberried and Todtnau in the Black Forest. The Notschrei Skiing Trails are also one of the five Biathlon base camps in Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Trails  Four skiing trails are located on the Nothschrei: *St√ºbenwasen Trail (20 km starts on the Notschrei (1119m), continues over the St√ºbenwasen (1386m) and the Todtnauer H√ºtte (1300m) which is located on the Feldberg and finally leads all the way back. The elevation difference is about 260 metres and the total ascent is about 550 metres. There are several shortcuts: 6 km, 11 km, 13 km und 15 km. These shortcuts lead the Nordic skier to Muggenbrunn and the trails of Todtnauberg and the Feldberg. The trail has been changed oftentimes over the course of the last few years. The segment which led the Nordic skier over the biathlon area and all around the Ahornkopf was closed. Instead a loop and more elevation in the beginning were added. *Schauinsland Trail (18 km starts on the Notschrei, continues over the Trubelmattskopf which is located close to the Wiedener Eck, and finally leads all the way back above the village of Muggenbrunn. This trail also includes some shortcuts: : 6 km, 9 km und 15 km. The Nordic skier here also has the possibility to visit Muggenbrunn, the mountain inn Kn√∂pflesbrunnen and the Wiedener Eck, where there crosses another skiing trail which leads the Nordic Skier to the cross-country skiing centre Hohtann. *Halden Trail is a floodlight trail which length varies depending on the snow situation. Its length is variable, most times however, 2.5 km. It is accessible via the Schauinsland Trail by a junction after approximately 1 km, the length of this said trail is approximately 1,5 km. The trail also offers connections tot the Hofgrund Trail and the summit station Schauinsland. *The Biathlon Trail has an approximate length of 3 km. Regional and nationwide championships are being staged here. All four trails are circular tours, which means they all lead back to where the trails started. Due to the various connection possibilities to adjacent trails, the Notschrei Trails can also be used as hiking trails. The hiking trail Schonach-Belchen, which is 100 km long, runs between the Todtnauer H√ºtte and H√∂rnle on the Notschrei Trails. All trails are always prepared to be used for classic and skating-technique skiing. Since 2000, the number of Nordic skiers increased drastically due to global warming and the rising popularity of Nordic skiing. The St√ºbenwasen Trail is one of the few snow-sure trails in the Black Forest.  Foundation and service  In 1975, the association Notschrei-Loipe e.V. was founded by the municipalities Freiburg im Breisgau, Kirchzarten, M√ºnstertal, Oberried, Todtnau, Wieden and the Landesforstverwaltung Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Since 1997, around 5.700 private members have joined the club, including the foundation members (retrieved 2018).Ulrike J√§ger: \\"Nordic-Center Notschrei: Schnee von gestern f√ºr die Loipe von heute.\\" In: S√ºdkurier. online edition 26 November 2018, retrieved 13 January 2019. The club runs a guest house at the start of the St√ºbenwasen trail, which offers a bathroom with a shower and a room where skis can be waxed. At the moment, the bedrooms on the second floor are reserved for athletes only. There is a service centre offering skis for rent, a Nordic skiing school and a parking site belonging to the club, all of which are located in close proximity.  Biathlon Centre Notschrei  The biathlon centre has been the main training location for biathletes from the Black Forest for many years. It is the fifth biathlon centre in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, next to the centres in Gosheim, Sch√∂nwald, Ulm and Furtwangen. The centre on the Notschrei includes a shooting range for small-bore rifles and is the only one in Baden-W√ºrttemberg where national and international competitions are held. The shooting targets work electronically. The centre also serves as a training location during summer. In 2006, people decided to upgrade the centre for 750.000 ‚Ç¨ (around ¬£657.712/$854.151).

Johnson retired in 2016.  Background and education  Johnson was born in the suburbs of Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1929. From a young age she enjoyed a connection with nature partaking in hiking, camping, and writing poems about the landscape. Her family enjoyed vacations in Vermont and at Martha‚Äôs Vineyard. As a child she inherited her brother‚Äôs small time newspaper, The Boulevard Bugle, and increased its readership twenty-fold, marking her first foray into business. She received her undergraduate degree from Wellesley College in 1951. Johnson worked briefly at the New England Nursery where she did plant propagation and sold plants to the surrounding community. Here, she began giving design advise to customers and became involved with the Harvard Graduate School of Design.Carol Johnson (July 2006). ‚ÄúOral History Interview Transcrip‚Äù (PDF) (Interview). Interviewed by Charles A. Birnbaum, James Sheldon, and Shirley Veenema. The Cultural Landscape Foundation. Retrieved 30 April 2020. Johnson went on to earn a graduate degree in landscape architecture from Harvard in 1957. Johnson holds honorary degrees from Wentworth Institute of Technology and Gettysburg College.  Career  After graduate school, Johnson took a position with The Architects Collaborative in 1958. Just one year later, she founded her own firm, Carol R. Johnson Associates. Between 1959 and 1970, Johnson operated her practice initially out of her apartment in Cambridge and then out of a small office on Mount Auburn Street in Harvard Square. In 1970, the firm changed its name from Carol R. Johnson, Landscape Architect, to Carol R. Johnson & Associates to reflect the growing importance of the employees to the practice. In September of 1975, the firm was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Carol R. Johnson & Associates, Inc.The firm is known today as CRJA-IBI Group and has expanded to 10 principals and branch offices outside Boston. Johnson's work is recognized for the emphasis she placed on sites‚Äô natural and cultural contexts and history. She also focused on the social purpose of design and was part of President Johnson's Model Cities Program while working on North Common in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1972. She has overseen international projects focused on site development, open space planning, master planning, and urban development. Clients have included colleges and universities, corporations, and public agencies. Towards the end of her career, she took a backseat in managing her firm and focused on projects internationally, such as the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia, and at colleges and universities, including Cornell Campus Center at Rollins College. In addition to her practice, Johnson taught in the Planning Department at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. She was on staff from 1966 to 1973. She is also a frequent panelist and lecturer on landscape architecture beyond Harvard and has presented papers at several international conferences. She also serves as a Trustee for the Hubbard Educational Trust, which seeks to support education in landscape architecture across the United States. For ten years, Johnson served as a City of Boston Civic Design Commissioner. Finally, Ms. Johnson became a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1982 and has served as Chair of the Board of Designators of the George B. Henderson Foundation and on the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations landscape and historic buildings advisors committee. Johnson is described as a pioneer and leader in landscape architecture, not least because of what she achieved as a woman in the field. She was the first American woman to receive the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Medal, in 1998. She was featured in a Harvard symposium focusing on significant women in landscape architecture in 2011. She was also a leader in her field, irrespective of gender. She began her practice when the field was first starting to establish itself. She was one of the first landscape architects to work with scientists on brownfield remediation. For the Mystic River Reservation in Medford and Somerville, MA, she transformed a toxic landfill into a beautiful riverside park. This project was the first on- site soil mixing project in the U.S., and was long before ‚Äúsustainable design‚Äù was part of the popular vernacular. The transformation began in the late 1970‚Äôs and was completed in the early 80‚Äôs. It was an early example of Johnson's firm‚Äôs ability to meld its interest in history (in this case Charles Elliot‚Äôs approach to scenic and natural resource values) with state-of-the-art environmental sciences. A separate land reclamation and restoration effort at a former power plant site on Lake Cayuga in upstate New York helped to restore the site to a natural meadow landscape, which would subsequently go through the normal process of becoming forest again. Between 2000-2011 CRJA did a majority of their work on projects in the middle east which motivated them to establish a temporary studio in Abu Dhabi from 2007-2011.Our Legacy: IBI Placemaking.

History  Schlossgartensee View of Karlsruhe Palace from the Schlossgarten with Schlossgartensee and Schlossgartenbahn The palace garden was laid out by Margrave Karl Wilhelm, who founded Karlsruhe in 1715. Initially, a baroque garden was laid out not behind but in front of the palace which was unusual for the 18th century. Exotic plants, especially tulips, were planted on today's palace square. From 1731 to 1746, court gardener Christian Thran laid out today's palace garden in French Baroque style behind the palace. Karl Wilhelm's successor, his grandson Grand Duke Karl Friedrich, took over the government in 1746 and had areas of the garden redesigned by the court gardeners Johann Bernhard Saul and Philipp Ludwig M√ºller. Between 1767 and 1773, the western part was laid out as a Chinese garden with a garden house at its center. An artificial valley could be seen from a terrace and has been preserved along with a cave until today, as it now borders the orangery. From 1787 on, Friedrich Schweickardt took over the transformation of the palace garden into an English landscape garden. In 1789, a court joinery was set up in the castle garden. At the end of the 18th century, the garden was temporarily open to the public, although some regulations had to be followed. On the promenades, for example, it was forbidden to smoke tobacco and to let pigs and geese roam freely. From 1808 on, the botanical garden was created. In 1856, the court gardener Karl Mayer began to redesign the rear garden of the palace, and between 1864 and 1873, the palace garden lake was created. In 1884 the Weinbrenner-Tempel was moved from the Erbprinzengarten to the northwestern part of the Schlossgarten. On the occasion of the Bundesgartenschau in 1967, the palace garden was renovated and further developed in the style of an English landscape park. The Schlossgartensee (engl. palace garden lake) was also redesigned and the Schlossgartenbahn (engl. palace garden railway) was put into operation. The original plan was to operate the railway only during the Bundesgartenschau, but it was not dismantled again afterward. In 2001, a ribbon of 1645 blue majolica tiles was laid from the palace tower to the majolica manufactory on the north-western edge of the palace garden due to the 100th anniversary of the manufactory. In 2015, many events took place in the palace garden as part of the 300th city anniversary. For this purpose, a wooden pavilion designed by J√ºrgen Mayer was erected as a temporary building among other things.  Layout  The Schlossgartenbahn The large part of the palace garden is laid out as an English landscape garden. There are large meadows and numerous groups of trees, a lake and the long palace garden railway. The park is a cultural monument in accordance with the transitional regulation in ¬ß 28 of the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Law for the Protection of Monuments and Sites and accommodates further protected individual monuments: * Johann Peter Hebel Monument (1835), bust of Fridolin Fechtig, neo-Gothic cast- iron architecture by Karl Joseph Berckm√ºller * Hermann and Dorothea Sculpture Group (1833-1866) by Carl Johann Steinh√§user * S√§ulenbrunnen (engl. column fountain) * Weinbrenner-Tempel (engl.

As a representative of these organizations on the parliamentary salary commission established in 1917, she was instrumental in achieving progress on civil servants' pay. Her efforts led to the Pay Act (L√∏nningsloven) of 1919 which introduced equal pay for men and women. She also succeeded in introducing improvements for Danish schools based on her international experience in education. Biography Born on 21 October 1875 in √òster Hurup near Hadsund in the east of Jutland, Marie Thora Frederikke Pedersen was the daughter of the schoolteacher Niels Christian Pedersen (1843‚Äì1941) and Karen Marie Andersen (1847‚Äì1924). Against her father's will, she attended N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen to train as a teacher. After qualifying in 1900, she returned to Jutland where she was employed by the Aalborg school authority from 1901 to 1945. Pedersen is remembered above all for her work between 1915 and 1919 on achieving equal pay. After wages for civil servants had fallen by more than 10% during the First World War, the Danish Union of Teachers (Danmarks L√¶rerforening, DLF) initiated the reform process. Together with Marie Mortensen, Johanne M. S√∏rensen and Lucie Jensen, Pedersen was elected to DLF's executive board in 1916, where she called for equal pay for equal work but faced opposition from the union's representatives. In 1917, the Danish parliament Rigsdagen established a committee on pay for civil servants. With the support of the Women's Society and Copenhagen's Teachers' Association, Pedersen and two other representatives were appointed to the committee. Once again, she faced fierce opposition but in the end her views were supported. As a result, the Pay Act (L√∏nningsloven) of 1919 introduced equal pay for men and women. From 1919, Pedersen was in introducing several improvements to the curriculum in Danish schools, culminating in the 1937 Schools Act (Skoleloven). On the political front, she was a member of the Social Liberal Party, serving on the executive board from 1918 to 1926 and from 1939 to 1943 was a member of Aalborg's city council. From 1908 to 1915, she headed Aalborg's Women's Suffrage Association. Thora Pedersen died on 29 October 1954 in Aalborg where she is buried.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she moved to Oregon at a young age where she then became an active member of the suffragist movement. Redmond is best known for her efforts as secretary and then president of the Colored Women‚Äôs Equal Suffrage Association. After Oregonian women gained the right to vote in 1912, Redmond remained politically active by working on the campaigns of various Republicans.  Family background  Hattie Redmond was the daughter of emancipated slaves, LaVinia Blue and Reuben Crawford. At the time of her birth, the couple lived in St. Louis, Missouri. The family moved from Missouri to Marysville, California in 1871, and then to Hood River, Oregon, permanently placing themselves in Portland in 1880. LaVinia, who went by Vina, had a brother who lived in California, and their intention as a family was to always remain on the West Coast. Reuben first worked as a rope maker and then as an expert ship caulker, and he was named \\"the best ship caulker on the west coast\\" by The Oregonian in 1918. LaVinia stayed at home and also worked partly as a domestic servant. Historical records do not definitively confirm how the family was able to finance the move from Missouri to California. However, the family may have relied on the Freedman's Bureau, which would have granted them railroad access since they were emancipated slaves leaving the south. Alternatively, Reuben's new job at a ship construction site may have paid for him to move. Reuben Crawford was an active member of the Republican Party and the Colored Immigrants Aids Society. The Crawford family became a socially well-known family in Portland's African American community, which consisted of hundreds of individuals. The Crawford family attended Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, the first established black Baptist church in Oregon, where in 1912, Redmond held educational conferences on women's suffrage.  Early life  Redmond was born some time in 1862 in St. Louis. She was LaVinia and Reuben's first child, and she became the oldest of eight children. She was about 9 years old when the family moved to California and about 18 when the family settled in Portland. Redmond likely grew up in a boarding house, since African Americans could not own property, and there were few single family homes available in the area at the time. Redmond attended Portland's Colored School, a public school for African American children. Her introduction to the church was at age 12 when her father signed her up to recite a poem that she wrote for Mt. Olivet Baptist Church's winter social. The poem was entitled \\"I'm So Happy,\\" and it received a positive reception. In November 1883, Harriet Crawford married waiter Emerson Redmond in her parents' home; he worked at Portland hotels, such as the Portland Hotel. However, it is reported that the marriage was unhappy, and her husband died at the Multnomah County Poor Farm on March 26, 1907. Hattie and Emerson Redmond did not have any children.  Activism  Redmond was an active member of the Oregon Colored Women‚Äôs Council, an organization dedicated to helping black women in need. Later, she became secretary, then president, of the offshoot Colored Women‚Äôs Equal Suffrage Association formed in 1912. During this time, Redmond estimated that the low membership of the group, 14 out of 2,500 potentially eligible black women in Portland, stemmed from the lack of awareness for the benefits of suffrage as well as negative influence from husbands and families. As part of the Colored Women‚Äôs Equal Suffrage Association leadership, Redmond organized meetings and lectures in churches around the city, particularly at Mt. Olivet Baptist Church. In 1912 she held educational conferences on women's suffrage there. She also served on the Central Campaign Committee which was a major director of the suffrage movement in Oregon. This committee united suffrage efforts from around the state and worked to foster cooperation between the different factions of the movement. Ultimately, the suffrage movement succeeded and Oregon voters ratified women's right to vote on November 5th, 1912. Redmond registered to vote as a Republican during April 1913. Redmond's work on campaigning for women's right to vote also laid a foundation for the civil rights activism which became prominent in early-20th century Oregon. During the 1914 election season, Redmond and other activists who helped gain Oregon women the right to vote worked on the campaigns of several Republican candidates. The women on a campaign committee voted Redmond to be their vice president.  Later life and death  Although jobs were limited for African American women at the time, Redmond was able to find work in a variety of positions. Her 1913 voter's registration card lists her profession as a hairdresser. At other times, she worked as a department store cleaner, a domestic servant, and lastly, as a janitor for Oregon's U.S. District Court. She served as a janitor for twenty-nine years until her retirement in 1939. That year's March 17th edition of The Oregonian recognized her service with an article entitled ‚ÄúJanitress Lauded for Long Service.‚Äù Also, upon her retirement, she received an autographed picture and a letter from the postmaster general. On June 27th, 1952, Hattie Redmond died of bronchial pneumonia at 90 years old.  Legacy  The Hattie Redmond Women and Gender Center at Oregon State University. Redmond is buried at the Lone Fir Pioneer Cemetery. On July 21st, 2012, the Century of Action Committee honored her and three other suffragists‚ÄîEsther Pohl Lovejoy, Harry Lane, and Martha Cardwell Dalton‚Äîby installing new headstones for them at the cemetery. Before the replacements, they had become overgrown. Redmond's new headstone is inscribed with the words \\"Black American Suffragist\\". The installation ceremony included costumed portrayals of the four suffragists and was attended by Barbara Roberts, a former Oregon governor. This event took place as part of the Century of Action Committee's year-long celebration of 100 years of suffrage for women in Oregon and as part of their efforts to call attention to remaining voting barriers for minorities. In July 2018, the president of Oregon State University, Ed Ray, announced that three campus buildings would be renamed due to their namesakes' racism. One of these buildings, formerly known as the Benton Annex, became the Hattie Redmond Women and Gender Center. The building was previously named for Thomas Hart Benton, an antebellum United States Senator from Missouri. The choice to rename it after Redmond was made to recognize her efforts as an Oregonian suffragist.

It was first published in France in August 2016 by Grasset, and has since been translated into 36 languages.  Summary  Set in Burundi and Rwanda from 1993 onwards, the novel is narrated by ten-year-old Gaby, who lives with his French father and Rwandan mother in an impasse in a comfortable district of Bujumbura. Gabriel's sheltered upbringing leaves him oblivious to the increasing tensions between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority (to which he, through his mother, belongs). As neighbouring Rwanda faces the outbreak of civil war and genocide, which spill over into Burundi, the innocence of Gaby and his group of friends is brutally shattered. The novel is based on Ga√´l Faye's own experiences growing up in Burundi during this period; the author has, however, stressed that it is not strictly autobiographical.  Reception  The novel was very well-received upon its publication in France, selling 700,000 copies. It was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt in 2016, as well as for awards by F√©mina, M√©dicis, Interalli√©, the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and Renaudot. In the same year, it won the prix Goncourt des lyc√©ens, chosen by lyc√©e students (roughly equivalent to high-school age).

Ginachero studied in Granada and Madrid in medicine where he obtained excellent results before doing additional studies in Berlin and Paris. His return to his hometown saw him implement practices he learnt in Europe that not all doctors followed in terms of sanitation in order to reduce patient deaths. He was a distinguished doctor noted for his care for the poor and his meticulous attention to medical practices. This earned him accolades in recognition of his importance to the M√°laga social arena and earn him praise from the nation's monarchs. The beatification process for \\"San Jos√©\\" - as some people referred to him as in life - opened in the 2000s thus enabling for him to be titled as a Servant of God. Life Jos√© G√°lvez Ginachero was born in M√°laga on 29 September 1866 to Jos√© de G√°lvez Andujar and Carmen Ginachero Vulpius. Ginachero did his initial studies in the Colegio de San Rafael and then attended high school before he graduated after obtaining his diploma in 1882. He then entered into the college in Granada after enrolling in the medical department and graduated there in 1888 before relocating to Madrid to pursue his doctorate at the college there. He obtained his PhD \\"cum laude\\" and then from 1890 until 1892 did additional studies in Berlin and Paris in order to broaden his medical expertise and studied under doctors such as Louis Hubert Farabeuf. Ginachero then returned to his native M√°laga where he began tending to the poor and to those who were unable to afford proper medical care. In 1893 he joined the Provincial Civil Hospital in M√°laga and would remain there until 1951. In 1904 he married Mar√≠a Moll Sampelayo (d. 1934) and the pair had three children together: * Mar√≠a del Carmen * Josefina * Jos√© (who became a doctor) Ginachero was meticulous in his medical duties and was known for having been mild-mannered with a good sense of humor. He awoke at five each morning and then after attending Mass would begin his work. He sometimes slept in the hospital rather than at home in order to tend to those ill people that needed either immediate or constant care. To that end a small room with a small bunk was prepared for him if he needed a place to sleep in. In addition he introduced new techniques in the hospital that he learnt in Europe for better sterilization in order to avoid patient deaths. Before he operated on his patients he would do the sign of the Cross on the area to be operated on as a sign of asking God for His support during the procedure. In 15 June 1923 he was voted as the director for the Provincial Civil Hospital (in recognition of his contributions to the field of medicine) and began making significant improvements in food and the acquisition of medical supplies. His term as the director ended in 1927. In 1924 he co- founded the Santa Cristina Hospital alongside Queen Maria Cristina. He became one of the first surgeons to deliver an infant after their mother died in an operation he conducted on 17 July 1898; Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez G√°lvez (1870-1898) was admitted into the hospital but died after she arrived though a C-section allowed for the birth of her daughter who was named Mar√≠a del Carmen Enriquetta. The Bishop of M√°laga Juan Mu√±oz Herrera baptized her with Ginachero acting as her godparent. In 1923 it was proposed that he become the mayor for M√°laga and after having had time to consider the offer took the position (succeeding Le√≥n Donaire) and served in office until he resigned in 1926 to go back to being a doctor (with Enrique Cano Ortega succeeding him). In office he undertook a series of ambitious projects for better sanitation and sought to implement a restoration of the sewer network in order to ensure greater cleanliness. He was arrested on 10 August 1932 on the suspicion of having been plotting against the government and spent time in jail until 13 August when officials released him. Two lepers secured his release after going to the governor and threatening to have all the town's lepers overrun the streets if he was not released. During the Spanish Civil War he was arrested once again but was released after fronting a court and succeeding in answering their queries. But he was pained when his pregnant daughter Josefina was imprisoned for a brief period. Ginachero also helped to organize Catholic Action in M√°laga taking inspiration from Pope Pius XI. In 1947 he was awarded with the Great Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X and later in life left his widowed sister Carmen his inheritance. Ginachero became ill after contracting cancer; on 29 April 1952 the Bishop of M√°laga √Ångel Herrera Oria (and future cardinal) came to visit him though Ginachero died just after the bishop left. Oria celebrated his funeral. Beatification process The beatification process opened in the M√°laga diocese under Bishop Antonio Dorado Soto on 13 July 2006 and was closed just over a decade later under Bishop Jes√∫s Esteban Catal√° Ib√°√±ez on 16 June 2017. The formal introduction of the cause came on 19 December 2007 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree and titled Ginachero as a Servant of God. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Francisco Garc√≠a Mota.

SquashBusters has served over 800 New England-based students since its founding in 1996. The organization, established by former squash professional Greg Zaff, is the oldest urban squash program in America. SquashBusters is a founding member of the National Urban Squash and Education Association, which currently includes 20 urban squash programs across the country. History = Founding = Greg Zaff, formerly the second-ranked squash player in the world, devised the concept of SquashBusters while enrolled at the Harvard John F. Kennedy School of Government. As a student in a social entrepreneurship class, he wrote \\"Bringing Squash Down from the Ivory Tower,\\" a paper focused on broadening the appeal of the sport through the creation of an urban squash program. A few years later, in the mid-1990s, he quit his job at the Government of Massachusetts to focus on developing what would ultimately become SquashBusters. Zaff liaised with local politicians and institutions to secure support -- Harvard University agreed to lend the program court space, and then-Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld joined the board of directors. The program officially began in 1996, when Zaff picked up 24 students from Boston middle schools and took them to local squash courts at the Boston YMCA and the Harvard Club of Boston. Programming ran for three days a week, with an hour and a half of homework help and an hour and a half of squash practice. Based on the impact of the program, Zaff wanted to expand SquashBusters to continue serving students through high school. However, there were not enough available courts in Boston to sustain middle and high school programming. Zaff began to search for a permanent location to establish SquashBusters. = Partnership with Northeastern = In the early 2000s, SquashBusters officially partnered with Northeastern University to build a permanent facility. Then-Northeastern President Richard M. Freeland had played squash through college and was supportive of SquashBusters' mission and vision. Freeland and Zaff agreed that Northeastern would provide the land free of charge if Squashbusters raised $6 million to cover the cost of building the facility. Following a successful round of fundraising, the Badgers & Rosen SquashBusters Facility officially opened in 2003. SquashBusters must raise an additional $2 million each year to cover operational costs, for which they host a number of annual charity squash tournaments, including the MFS SquashBusters Derby.  Programming = Squash= Founded on the sports-based youth development program model, SquashBusters provides students with three to five hours of squash practice per week. Squash instruction is provided by volunteers, staff coaches, and former professionals, including world champions Thierry Lincou and Amanda Sobhy. SquashBusters students play in matches against local high school squash teams, tournaments with other urban squash programs, and regional and national junior-level championships. Since 2018, 31 SquashBusters alumni have gone on to play collegiate squash for universities such as Colby College and Harvard University. = College Preparation = The ultimate aim of the SquashBusters program is for every student to enroll in, and eventually graduate from, college. As early as middle school, students visit college information sessions. When participants enter high school, SquashBusters offers standardized test preparation, essay workshops, and one-on-one mentorship throughout the college application process. Additionally, they provide financial aid counseling and scholarship opportunities for collegiate alumni. Ninety percent of SquashBusters graduates enroll in college, nearly thirty percent higher than the Boston Public Schools average.  Regional Expansion  = Lawrence = In 2012, Dora Lubin, a former employee at CitySquash, an urban squash program in the Bronx, opened a SquashBusters affiliate in Lawrence, Massachusetts. SquashBusters Lawrence operates in borrowed facilities from Brooks School and Phillips Academy, private preparatory high schools in Northern Massachusetts. The program serves 87 students, over half of whom speak English as a second language. = Providence = In 2018, SquashBusters expanded to a third location in Providence, Rhode Island. Squash instruction is led by Rodney Galvao, a graduate of SquashBusters Boston and former member of the Bates College squash team. The program operates out of the newly built Gorgi Family Squash and Education Center at the Moses Brown School. = National Affiliation = In 2005, Zaff joined forces with directors of urban squash programs in the Bronx and Philadelphia to establish the National Urban Squash and Education Association. Now called the Squash and Education Alliance (SEA), the organization aims to support and connect urban squash programs in twenty-two cities across America and five locations globally. As a founding member, SquashBusters is highly active in the SEA community. SquashBusters students participate in SEA events like the annual Urban Squash Citizenship Tour, where they met with then-Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in 2014.

He was eventually diagnosed as suffering from hallucinations and sent to Taunton Lunatic Asylum, where he supposedly died. Biography Not much is known about Santo's life prior to his immigration to America, but it is known that he was born circa 1894 in Italy. Sometime prior to the murders, he had begun showing signs of mental illness. His parents claimed that he contracted scarlet fever when he was around six years old and that \\"his mind [had] been afflicted\\" since that time. On June 6, 1908 Anthony Santo (age 14) was apprehended and questioned regarding the theft of a bicycle. He confessed to murdering his two cousins, Frank and James Marino (ages 18 and 12 respectively) in Brooklyn as well as six-year-old Louise Staula in Dedham. =Murder of James and Frank Marino= According Santo's confession, he led his two cousins on a long walk in the woods in Brooklyn near 6th Street. When the boys weren't looking, he throw large rocks at their heads. James was killed by the rocks, but Santo used a pocket knife to kill Frank after injuring him with the rocks. Santo claimed that he buried Frank's body in the woods, but could not remember what had become of James' body. He also could not recall an exact date, only that it was around March 1. =Murder of Louise Staula= About a month before Louise Staula's death, Santo moved to East Boston where he lived with another cousin. He then began work as a water boy, helping with the construction of a sewer. In May of 1908, the body of six-year-old Louise F. Staula was found in the Charles River meadow which was behind her house. Ten fist-sized rocks were found near the body, five had bloodstains. Police theorized that she had been stoned to death based on her injuries. On June 6, Santo was apprehended for bicycle theft and confessed to the murder as well as that of his two cousins. Santo claimed that on May 11, while in Dedham, he chanced upon 6-year-old Louise Staula. In that moment he claimed to experience a \\"mad spell\\" and struck the girl once before picking up a rock and throwing it at her while she tried to escape. Louise was struck on the head and fell on the ground. Thinking she was dead, Santo began praying for her so he could \\"make her get better\\". Staula hadn't died yet, but without any help she eventually died from her injuries. Anthony stayed with Staula's body for a while before deciding to leave her body in the open field and flee. =Arrest, confession and imprisonment= Santo was captured in Norwood, after he was caught trying to steal a bike. After an examination and trial, Police Chief Fred S. Sackett and a few reporters were interviewing the boy when he announced that he had something important to tell them. He then confessed to the murders of his two cousins. The policemen immediately detained the alleged murderer until an investigation could be conducted. While being interrogated regarding his earlier confession, Santo also told the investigators that he had murdered Staula. Police records in Brooklyn did not support Santo's confession. No boys by the last name Marino had been reported missing around the time Santo claimed to have committed the murders. Santo indicated that his cousins lived at 461 Carroll Street, but other tenants could not confirm that anyone by the name Marino lived in the building in at least the last year. Despite his confession, the officers and doctors questioning him also determined that he was not connected with Staula's death. They claimed that he was \\"feeble- minded\\" and delusional, suffering from hallucinations. Shortly after, an order for his removal was issued by the authorities of Dedham, and Santo was submitted to the Taunton Lunatic Asylum. It is assumed that he died there, but the date of death remains unknown.

This classification system, which takes Indigenous knowledge structures into account, has been extended and adapted for use by other libraries in Canada. Deer died on January 12, 2019 at the Royal-Victoria hospital in Montreal.  Education  After graduating from John Grant High School in 1962, Deer obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 1966. Several years later, Deer pursued a Master of Library Science at McGill University which he completed in 1974.  Librarianship  Deer's work on classification has had wide impact on the practice of librarianship and on the theory of knowledge organization, especially as it relates to Indigenous peoples. A. Brian Deer was one of the first Indigenous librarians in Canada. He worked at the library of the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) in Ottawa, Canada. Finding the system of classification in use problematic, and finding nothing in existence which could adequately organize the materials for use in an Indigenous context, he created a new system. Deer went on to work at the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs library, the Cultural Centre at Kahnawake, and the Mohawk Nation Office.

Biography  Born in to a family of poor Russian peasants, Yudin worked as a lathe operator in a railway workshop in 1917-19. He joined the Russian Communist Party in 1918, served in the Red Army 1919-21, and graduated from the Zinoviev University (later renamed the Stalin University) in Leningrad in 1924, after which he began a post graduate course at the Institute of Red Professors, where he was one of the minority of students who supported Stalin against the right wing opposition, led by Nikolai Bukharin, who opposed the forced collectivisation of agriculture. Yudin was one of three signatories of an article, published in Pravda on 7 June 1930, denouncing Abram Deborin, who was the leading soviet communist philosopher of the 1920s. Deborin regarded the late Georgi Plekhanov as the most authoritative Russian Marxist philosopher. Yudin and his co-signatories - who included his long time colleague M. B.

Yudin was one of the original members of the organising committee of the Writers Union, but very soon earned the contempt of its Chairman, the writer Maxim Gorky, who wrote Stalin a long letter on 2 August 1934 accusing Yudin of promoting \\"intellectually feeble men.\\" He added: = Role in the Purges = During the Great Purge, according to the Yugoslav communist leader, Josip Broz Tito \\"in the Soviet Union there was a joke about Yudin, that he was 'the best philosopher among the NKVD-men and the best NKVD-man among the philosophers.\\" In April 1937, he sent Stalin and Lazar Kaganovich a lengthy memo denouncing the playwright Vladimir Kirshon as an associate of Averbakh and of the ousted former NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda, both recently arrested, saying that Kirshon and Averbakh had \\"held discussions of a Trotskyite nature\\", and that Kirshon had undergone a \\"repugnant Political and personal disintegration.\\" He also accused Gorky's long-serving former secretary Pyotr Kryuchkov of having 'poisoned' Gorky's relations with the writers union. Those four were all executed, but the historian Isaak Mints survived despite being denounced by Yudin, in the same letter as \\"a two-faced Janus, the toady of Yagoda and Kryuchkov.\\" = Post War Career = In 1937-1946, Yudin was director of OGIZ (the Association of State Books and Magazines), the state publishing house. In 1939-1944 he was also Director of the Institute of Philosophy of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1940-42, Yudin and Mitin edited the three volume –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ–∏–π (Istoriya filosofi - History of Philosophy), which won the 1942 Stalin Prize, reputedly the first book on philosophy to achieve that award. But in May 1944, the third volume was attacked in an editorial in the magazine Bolshevik for allegedly failing to recognise that the philosopher Georg Hegel was a German nationalist and racist. The Stalin Prize committee revised its previous decision, saying that the prize was for the first two volumes of the History of Philosophy, and Yudin and Mitin were sacked from the positions they held in the Institute of Philosophy and on the board of Under the Banner of Marxism. Yudin suffered another humiliation in October 1946, when he was accused of having mismanaged OGIZ, and was sacked. These setback in Yudin's were obviously connected to the rise of Andrei Zhdanov, who emerged around 1946 as the Soviet communist party's chief ideologist and Stalin's successor-in-waiting. That Yudin was frightened of Zhdanov is evident from the eye witness account by the Serbian communist Koca Popovic: = Diplomatic career = When Cominform was founded, in October 1947, Yudin was appointed editor of the Cominform journal, For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!, based in Belgrade, which was then the capital of Yugoslavia. There he played a major role in the split between the USSR and Yugoslavia, which culminated in the Yugoslav communist party's expulsion from Cominform, and a failed attempt by Moscow to destroy the Tito regime. In March 1948, Yudin suppressed an article written for the journal by the Yugoslav communists Vladimir Dedijer and Radovan Zogoviƒá, which had expressed solidarity with liberation movements in Asia. In that instance, he was almost certainly following orders, because he was allowed almost no initiative while running this magazine, every issue of which had to be sent to Moscow for approval before it could be published. \\\\- but according to the future Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, he used his position to sow trouble between Tito and Stalin, by sending Stalin a report alleging that the Yugoslavs had made insulting remarks about the military and technical advisers sent to them from the Soviet Union. The report was circulated to members of the Soviet Politburo Soon afterwards, the Soviet Union withdrew its advisers. On 27 March 1948, the Soviet leadership sent a letter Tito setting out various complaints, including an allegation that Yudin was under surveillance in Belgrade. Tito later alleged: \\"Yudin's work in Belgrade was not restricted to the paper. He took an active part in preparing the final reckoning with Yugoslavia. He tried hard to poison relations between Yugoslavia and her neighbours, especially Bulgaria and Albania.\\" In 1950, when Stalin was concerned that China might be the next communist country to refuse to recognise him as leader of the communist bloc, Yudin was dispatched to Beijing, to assist in arranging publication of the works of Mao Zedong. According to Khrushchev, this was at Mao's request, because \\"Mao wanted an educated man to help him put his works into proper shape and catch any mistakes in Marxist philosophy becore Mao's works were published.\\" He was back in Moscow in October 1952, for the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, at which he was made a member of the Central Committee and a candidate member of the Praesidium of the Central Committee. After the Congress, he was sent to Berlin as political advisor to the Soviet Control Commission in East Germany. In 1953, he was promoted to the post of Deputy High Commissioner of the USSR in East Germany. Yudin was Soviet Ambassador to China from 3 December 1953 to 15 October 1959. He was re-elected to the Central Committee at the 20th Party Congress in 1956 (the one during which Khrushchev delivered the Secret Speech exposing Stalin's crimes.) Having delivered a speech to the Central Committee plenum afterwards, Yudin reputedly exclaimed, purely out of habit \\"Long live Comrade Stalin!\\" - which produced an embarrassed silence, followed by an apology from the speaker. He was recalled from China after the split between the USSR and China, which followed Khrushchev's meeting with President Eisenhower in Camp David. On his return, he blamed Khrushchev, rather than Mao, for the split, to which Khrushchev retorted: \\"I might remark with some justification that we were sure to have discord with any country where Yudin was sent as ambassador. Yudin was sent to Yugoslavia and we had a falling out with Tito. Yudin went to China, and we had a falling out with Mao. This is no coincidence.\\" In 1960-68, Yudin worked at the Institute of Philosophy of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  In Literature  Yudin is mentioned by name in Vasili Grossman's classic novel, Life and Fate, when a soldier named Vavilov tells his comrades: \\"Once, I had to drive a lecturer from Moscow to the front -Pavel Fyodorovich Yudin. The member of the Military Soviet had said that it would be the end of me if I lost so much as a hair off his head. Now that was really hard work. We had to dive straight into the ditch if a plane came anywhere near. But Comrade Yudin certainly knew how to take care of himself - I'll say that for him.\\"  References  Category:1899 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from Sergachsky District Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to China Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Stalin Prize winners Category:Moscow State University faculty Category:Soviet philosophers Category:Russian historians of philosophy Category:Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:Institute of Red Professors alumni Category:Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union candidate members Category:Third convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Fourth convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery ","title":"Pavel Yudin"},{"id":"59696556","text":"Edgar Sydenstricker (15 July 1881 ‚Äì 19 March 1936) was an American economist and statistician. Sydenstricker was born on 15 July 1881 in Shanghai to missionaries Caroline Maude (Stulting) (1857‚Äì1921) and Absalom Sydenstricker. His parents returned to their home state of West Virginia for the birth of his younger sister Pearl S. Buck. Sydenstricker came to the United States in 1896. He enrolled at Fredericksburg College and later Washington and Lee University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Sydenstricker completed a master's of art degree at Washington and Lee in 1902. For further graduate study, Sydenstricker enrolled at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University. He was a high school principal in Onancock, Virginia until 1905, when he became editor of the Daily Advance, a newspaper in Lynchburg, Virginia. Sydenstricker also wrote for other publications. Between 1907 and 1908, Sydenstricker was a fellow in political economy at the University of Chicago, after which he worked for the United States Immigration Commission and the Commission on Industrial Relations until 1915. Sydenstricker joined the United States Public Health Service in 1915 to work with Benjamin S. Warren. Together, they researched the health and economic status of textile factory workers in New York City, as well as sickness insurance in Europe. From 1916 to 1918, Sydenstricker and Joseph Goldberger researched causes of pellagra in the American South. Sydenstricker and Wade Hampton Frost began in 1918 to research influenza with a statistical focus. Sydenstricker was named head of the Office of Statistical Investigations in 1920, and began the Hagerstown Morbidity Survey the next year. It later became the U. S. National Health Survey. In 1923, the League of Nations invited Sydenstricker to establish the Epidemiological Service of the Health Organization, which ran similar public health studies on an international scale. Sydenstricker became a consultant to the Milbank Memorial Fund in 1925. As he took on more extensive leadership roles within the organization, including as director of research in 1928 and scientific director in 1935, Sydenstricker's reduced his responsibilities at the Public Health Service to consultancy work. He served in several positions within the American Statistical Association, among them counsellor, member of the board of directors, and associate editor. Sydenstricker was elected a member of the ASA in 1917, and became a fellow in 1922. He also represented the association on Social Science Research Council between 1931 and 1934. He died on March 19, 1936, aged 54, of a cerebral hemorrhage.

Apart from this constraint of being an embedded device, the program did not impose any particular configuration, which made it possible to open the market to several aeronautical manufacturers. The Br√©guet Br 610 was a 3-seat floatplane with high shoulder mounted wings of all-metal construction, with a fuselage of welded steel tubes, covered with non-structural aluminium alloy panels and fabric.

She was a lecturer on microprocessor engineering at Leeds Polytechnic and Leeds Beckett University for 24 years. She was the president of the Women's Engineering Society from 1993 to 1995.  Early Life  Lynette's family comes from Sheffield but she was born near Hull, and she had three older brothers. She grew up in London and went to a girls' grammar school where her talents for science were encouraged, and special arrangements were made to allow her to study physics at A-level. In 1968, she started her BSc degree at the University of Surrey in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, being the only woman on the course. At Surrey, in response to how many lecturers inadequately conveyed information, she developed her interest in teaching. She also became aware of how sexism could affect her aspirations as she was discouraged from applying for a job on the British Antarctic Survey because there were no toilet facilities for women. She had two technician jobs while studying. Following her degree, she researched the teaching of engineering for 2 years.  Career in Electronics  Following her studies, Lynette became a science teacher at Foxwood School, Leeds. From 1977 to 1981, she worked as a medical physics technician at Leeds General Infirmary. In 1979, Lynette wrote to the New Scientist to complain about a sexist cartoon, pointing out how attitudes towards women affected their ability to partake in engineering careers. In 1981, Lynette played a key role in setting up one of the first centers for training women in technology and other skills, the East Leeds Women's Workshop. The project was set up following the closure of Burton's Tailoring Firm in Harehills, Leeds, which left many women unemployed. It aimed to provide free training in areas where women did not traditionally work such as electronics, micro-computing, carpentry and joinery to allow women to gain skills for successful employment. Minority women, including disabilities and BAME, were given priority and childcare was provided. Lynette taught electronics and computing. In 1984, Lynette contributed to a study on training for women in technology for the Manpower Services Commission. In 1985-1986, Lynette studied for an MSc in Microprocessor Engineering at University of Bradford. She began her involvement with the Women's Engineering Society. After unsuccessfully applying for jobs in industry, Lynette became a lecturer at Leeds Polytechnic, later called Leeds Beckett University after a friend encouraged her to apply. She taught a range of subjects including computer hardware, professional skills for computing, and the political and social implications of technology. She also taught for the Open University between 1972 and 1993. From 1993 to 1995, she was president of the Women's Engineering Society. In 2000, Lynette was chosen to research and write a short paper on the global state of technology education for women. In 2001, she contributed to a research project exploring how to increase access for women to the internet. Lynette retired in 2005. She kept her links with Leeds Beckett University until 2012. In 2019, Lynette contributed to a project celebrating 100 years of the Women's Engineering Society at the University of Leeds.  Career as an Artist  From 1998 to 2004, Lynette took a Fine Art degree at the Leeds College of Art and Design. In 2006, she finally got to Antarctica where she took photographs of the wildlife. From 2009, Lynette has worked on many site-responsive projects in Leeds and Bradford including the Ghosts Group at the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills and ghost installations at Saltaire. She also makes artist's books. She is an active member of Leeds Creative Time Bank.

The species was first documented in the 1970s and, being fairly new to scientific observation, has yet to be scientifically described. Because of this, LPSO has no official scientific name. Unlike other octopus species which are normally solitary, the LPSO has been reported as forming groups of up to 40 individuals. While most octopuses are cannibalistic and have to exercise extreme caution while mating, these octopuses mate with their ventral sides touching, pressing their beaks and suckers together in an intimate embrace. The LPSO has presented many behaviors that differ from most species of octopus, including intimate mating behaviors, formation of social communities, unusual hunting behavior, and the ability to reproduce multiple times throughout their life. The LPSO has been found to favor the tropical waters of the Eastern Pacific.  Appearance  Larger Pacific striped octopus LPSO exhibits three main body color patterns that include completely pale, completely dark brown, and a dark brown and white pattern that is referred to as \\"stripe-bar-spot\\". When displaying the stripe- bar-spot body color pattern, LPSO is observed to have bar and stripe patterns that alternate between brown and white across its head and mantle, and dark brown with white spots over its arm crown and arms. The pattern can serve as a unique identifier as it varies among individuals. Though LPSO has similar body color patterns to other octopuses like Octopus chierchiae, Octopus zonatus, Abdopus spp., Thaumoctopus mimicus, and Wunderpus photogenicus, the body patterns it exhibits are unique to the species.  Habitat and distribution  LPSO has been documented in many locations throughout the tropics of the Eastern Pacific. Specimens have been located in the Bay of Panama, Panama, Guatemala, Magdelena Bay, Baja Sur, Mexico, the northern Pacific coast of Columbia, and Nicaragua. LPSO seems to prefer denning in areas with soft muddy substrates or a mix of mud and sand, ranging in depth from 7m to 100m. The species has also been observed to form colonies of up to 40 close-living individuals. These colonies of LPSO construct dens within 1m of one another and live in the same general area for the span of their lives.  Mating  LPSO is known in particular for its display of mating behaviors that are vastly different from most octopus species. While most octopuses use either \\"distance mating\\" (when the male places hectocotylus into the female's mantle from a safe distance) or a mounting position, LPSO uses a more intimate approach. Typically, a brooding female that is ready to mate exhibits an entirely pale body color pattern while the male exhibits a high contrast stripe-bar-spot body color pattern. Once the male and female LPSO decide to mate, they join together in a beak-to-beak position, embracing in an entanglement of arms. Unlike some species of octopus, female LPSO are not cannabalistic during mating and are rather gentle, leaving only surface level sucker marks as a result of the beak-to-beak embrace. Pair bonding has been observed in LPSO through behaviors such as food and den sharing.  Brooding  Unlike most octopus species, LPSO can spawn multiple times throughout the span of their life. Eggs are laid in pairs within the den and the female tends to them until they hatch, running the tips of her arms over them to maintain the health of the eggs. Once hatched from the egg, the offspring are pelagic until adulthood.  Hunting  LPSO has been observed to prey upon a variety of shellfish including shrimp, stomatopods, crabs, and bivalves. They use hunting methods of stalking, chasing, and ambush depending on the prey item in question. When eating bivalves, smaller prey is either crushed or pulled apart, while holes are drilled into larger prey. When hunting shrimp, LPSO carefully extends its arm, suckers positioned outward, to touch and capture the shrimp. When hunting crabs, LPSO uses an ambush method, pouncing directly onto the crab for capture.  Lifespan  LPSO live about two years. Like most octopus species, LPSO goes through a stage of senescence, which marks the approach of death. Senescence in LPSO has been observed to be longer for females and shorter for males. After the first signs of senescence, males will typically last 1 to 2 weeks before death, while females will typically last between 2 and 4 months.

He is best known for his experimental images using techniques such as pinhole cameras, hand-painted photographs, photograms, and light drawings. Many of his photographs explore issues of gay identity, homoeroticism, and living with AIDS, linking his work to that of contemporaries such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Peter Hujar, and David Wojnarowicz. Though his style and approach set him apart from these contemporaries, \\"Lebe is now incontrovertibly part of the history of twentieth-century queer artists.\\"Matthew Leifheit, ‚ÄúLet Us Now Praise David Lebe,‚Äù Aperture, April 24, 2019, https://aperture.org/blog/david-lebe-matthew- leifheit/  Early life and education  Lebe was born in Manhattan and grew up downtown in Stuyvesant Town‚ÄìPeter Cooper Village. He attended the progressive City and Country School and the High School of Music & Art, from which he graduated in 1966. By age fifteen he had developed a deep interest in photography and regularly visited New York‚Äôs museums and galleries , where he admired the work of photographers such as Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Robert Frank, among others, and developed a life-long interest in street photography. In the fall of 1966, Lebe enrolled at the Philadelphia College of Art (PCA), where he studied photography with Ray K. Metzker, Barbara Blondeau, and Tom Porett. All three were graduates of Chicago‚Äôs Illinois Institute of Technology, founded by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy as a successor to Germany‚Äôs Bauhaus, with a strong tradition of experimentation. It was in Blondeau‚Äôs class in 1969‚Äì70 that he began to experiment with pinhole cameras, building his own devices with multiple apertures that allowed him to record panoramic views of the same subject from various angles. His senior thesis, Form without Substance, consisted largely of high-contrast images with strong black shadows taken in Philadelphia and around his childhood home in Manhattan. These early experiments have informed his approach to photography in subsequent decades, even as his methods and subject matter have changed.  Artistic career  After completing his studies in 1970, Lebe returned to PCA as an instructor in 1972. He would continue teaching at PCA (which became University of the Arts in 1985) until 1990. ‚ÄúAn experimentalist less interested in capturing the real than in freeing his images from the constraints of reality,‚ÄùJameson Fitzpatrick, ‚ÄúThe Body Made Light,‚Äù Art in America, April 22, 2019, https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazines/david-lebe/ he has produced multiple bodies of work that explore an array of subjects, often utilizing fundamental, relatively low-tech photographic techniques in innovative ways. Curator Tom Beck notes that ‚Äúautobiography is the key to [Lebe‚Äôs] work, which has shifted from time to time among photograms, light drawings, and male nudes.‚ÄùTom Beck, Truth Fantasy: David Lebe Photographs (1986), cited in Leifheit, ‚ÄúLet Us Now Praise David Lebe.‚Äù = Pinhole pictures = Lebe‚Äôs experimentation with pinhole pictures, begun as a student at PCA, continued through 1975. His first cameras had seven or nine apertures and could record 180-degree views but required access to a darkroom to change rolls of film between each photo. Around 1972 he added a more portable four- aperture camera that allowed him to photograph anywhere. Working both in the studio and outdoors, he collaborated with friends and strangers alike. \\"By opening and closing the apertures at different times, Lebe could create a single, scroll-like print of the whole event, transmuting it into a dreamy collage of social interactions.\\"Lev Feigin, ‚ÄúA Photographer‚Äôs Infinite Infinitude,‚Äù Hyperallergic, April 22, 2019, https://hyperallergic.com/495892/a-photographers-intimate-infinitude/ These images challenge the notion of the photograph as \\"decisive moment,\\" or record of a single fixed view in a discrete moment in time. \\"The vision of the world Lebe‚Äôs pinhole photographs offer ultimately doesn‚Äôt feel so decisive at all,\\" wrote poet and critic Jameson Fitzpatrick. \\"It is instead a refusal of settling on a definitive version of any given scene. There is no reality, these images suggest, only parallel realities.\\"Fitzpatrick, \\"The Body Made Light.\\" = Hand-painted photographs = Although Lebe sometimes shot with color film, he was dissatisfied with the results of color printing and the loss of darkroom control over the images. After finding a hand-coloring set in a camera store in New York, he began hand painting gelatin-silver prints, including pinhole images and photograms, and traditional photographs. In 1974‚Äì75 he created a series of images he called Unphotographs, meticulously hand-painted black-and-white photographic portraits of himself and others, often choosing colors that bore no relation to the actual subjects.Peter Barberie, Long Light: Photographs by David Lebe (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2019), 20, 22. = Photograms = In 1976, Lebe purchased a townhouse in Philadelphia with space for living quarters, a darkroom, and a studio. He began making photograms using plants collected from his rooftop garden or from trips to the country or beach. He converted these negative prints into positives, occasionally adding a Sabattier effect during the printing process. Some prints he left black and white; for others, he hand-colored the negative and/or the positive, a unique process that \\"transformed the photograms into surreal painterly abstractions.\\"Feigin, ‚ÄúA Photographer‚Äôs Infinite Infinitude.‚Äù Several distinct series emerged from this experimentation: Specimens, which features plants, bones, and other objects combined to create fantastic hybrid forms; Garden Series, images focused exclusively on plant material, often dissected and reassembled to create new ‚Äúspecies‚Äù; and Landscapes, which places these hybrid forms in hand-painted (and often otherworldly) settings. Of these images, Lebe has said: ‚ÄúI was creating the gardens and landscapes I longed for. Along the way, other ideas got expressed.‚ÄùRichard Kagan, ‚ÄúAn Interview with David Lebe,‚Äù The Photo Review 18, no. 2 (Spring 1995): 5. = Light drawings = Lebe‚Äôs first light drawings were self-portraits made in his small apartment in 1976. Using a 35mm camera on a tripod, he outlined his naked body with the flashlight, adding other lines and squiggles along the way. This initial experiment led to others in which he outlined people and objects, both indoors and outside in the nighttime cityscape. \\"Braiding the art of photography with the art of drawing, the artist caressed his models with light, sketching their faces, limbs, and genitals, and at times adding small fictional details such as luminous arcs touching the model‚Äôs bodies,\\" wrote Lev Feigin in Hyperallergic. \\"Demarcating the boundaries of desire, light preserves the men‚Äôs traces while eliciting a feeling of touch.\\"Feigin, ‚ÄúA Photographer‚Äôs Infinite Infinitude.‚Äù Like the earlier pinhole photographs, the light drawings required long exposure times, allowed Lebe to come out from the behind the camera and interact with his subjects. In this sense, his images became records of events rather than of frozen moments in time. ‚ÄúInstead of being a ‚Äòdecisive moment,‚Äô the photograph became the decisive twenty minutes,‚Äù he recalled in a 1993 interview. ‚ÄúIt became the basis for the way I continue to work.‚ÄùKagan, ‚Äú Interview,‚Äù 3. Lebe here refers to the statement by Henri Cartier-Bresson that a photograph should capture the ‚Äúdecisive moment.‚Äù Lebe continued to make light drawings for about a decade, becoming more and more adept at controlling and manipulating the light sources, which could include flashlights, strobes, and ambient light. In 1987, following the death of a close friend from AIDS and just before his own HIV diagnosis, he began creating abstract, figureless photos drawn freehand with a flashlight. Calling them Scribbles, Lebe made a number of these images, which often feature light emerging from a glass vase in the middle of a darkened space. At first, he felt that the photos ‚Äúwere frivolous and silly, and that I really had a responsibility to be making work that dealt with AIDS.‚Äù As he shared them with other people, however, he started to see them as representing the spirits of the dead and came to realize that they were indeed a response to the disease that was ravaging the gay community. ‚ÄúThe pictures were really a defiance of the fear and the pain, a kind of celebration of the spirits of so many who had died.‚ÄùKagan, ‚ÄúInterview,‚Äù 7. = The Scott photographs = In 1989, through a mutual friend, Lebe met the adult film star and author Scott O'Hara, who asked Lebe to take pictures of him. Lebe would photograph O‚ÄôHara four times between then and O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs death in 1998, in nude and often erotic images that also document the effects of AIDS on O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs body, as well as his determination to embrace sexual pleasure as a positive force in spite of the disease. Curator Peter Barberie notes that ‚Äúthese images differ from Robert Mapplethorpe‚Äôs famous exploration of similar subjects . . . by their emphasis on O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs personal sexuality. Whereas Mapplethorpe‚Äôs photographs are often overtly staged or cropped to objectify body parts and isolated sexual actions, Lebe‚Äôs are about his subject‚Äôs full presence in the world.‚ÄùBarberie, Long Light, 31. For Lebe, the Scott photographs represent ‚Äúa refusal to give up on life‚Äôs pleasures‚Äù and ‚Äúa triumph of the spirit over AIDS.‚ÄùDavid Lebe, ‚ÄúAbout the Scott Photographs‚Äù (2013), www.davidlebe.com (accessed January 10, 2019). = Food for Thought and Morning Ritual = In 1989, Lebe met Jack Potter, a ceramic artist and horticulturist, and the two quickly began a relationship that has endured for three decades. Both men were HIV-positive when they met, and they were suspicious of the single-drug treatments then being prescribed to fight the disease. After taking a cooking class with chef Christina Pirello, who was then teaching Macrobiotics, they embraced a Macrobiotic diet for about five years and eventually settled on a whole-foods plant-based diet, which they continue to maintain. Seeking a healthier and more peaceful environment, the pair moved to rural Columbia County, New York in 1993. In 1992, as the couple transitioned from city to country, Lebe had started making still-life photographs featuring the organic vegetables that had become their staple. For this series, which he titled Food for Thought, Lebe shot arrangements of daikon, lotus root, squash, beans, wild kombu, and other foods against black backgrounds, sometimes adding spirals of light around them. In a sense, this series brought together his earlier plant photograms and the light-drawing portraits, with the vegetables standing in for the eroticized male nudes of the latter. Despite their efforts at a healthy diet and lifestyle, Lebe and Potter both began to decline in the mid-1990s. In 1994, in the series Morning Ritual, Lebe documented his lover‚Äôs daily self-care regimen in small, intimate black-and-white portraits. \\"Despite their relatively banal content, the photographs are heavy with the weight of illness and the knowledge not only of one‚Äôs own mortality, but also of a beloved‚Äôs,\\" wrote Jameson Fitzpatrick in Art in America. \\"The anxious impulse to document the everyday makes the series seem as much an advance mourning ritual as a morning one.\\"Fitzpatrick, \\"The Body Made Light.\\" In Jack‚Äôs Garden (1996‚Äì97) Lebe made detailed studies of the gardens Potter had cultivated around their residence, not knowing how much longer they might have to enjoy them. = Recent work = In 1996, Lebe and Potter began combination-drug therapy, which was showing great success in extending the lives of HIV-positive individuals. With an extended future, Lebe began exploring new ways of making photographs. By 2004, he had fully embraced digital photography and continued to take pictures of the garden and natural environment around their house for the series On May Hill. He also began making new color prints of older photographs, including his early pinhole prints, which he was now able to enlarge. With the pinholes he fulfilled a fantasy of seeing them the way he had always dreamed of them looking. In 2013 he embarked on a series titled ShadowLife, in which he records shadows and reflections illuminated by the early morning light streaming through the windows of his house, continuing the exploration his life-long fascination with shadows.Barberie, Long Light, 35. Lebe was the subject of a comprehensive survey exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in February‚ÄìMay 2019, consisting of 145 photographs from 1969 to the present, drawn primarily from the museum‚Äôs extensive collection of work by the artist.

Life Nobbs started her working life as a shorthand typist but very much felt that this was the \\"wrong job\\" for her. Her father, Walter William Nobbs, was a well known London heating and ventilation engineer, who had worked on many London buildings, including New County Hall for the (then) London County Council, the new premises for the RIBA and the headquarters of the (then IEE) at Savoy Hill, as well as being President of the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers in 1920, and his father was a civil engineer. This family history, and a belief that her personal talents lay in mathematics and geometry, encouraged Madeleine, having read a book about technical drawing, to declare she wished to be an engineer. Her father was somewhat skeptical, as he feared that the drinking culture of consulting engineering would not be conducive to progression by his daughter. However, after her mother (Francoise Leonie Thebault) met with Adria Buchanan, the first women to become a member of the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers, she interceded, telling her husband \\"with a charming smile and in her delightful French accent\\" that he could no longer refuse to support his daughter in her ambition. Madeleine persuaded a firm of heating and ventilation engineers that she would be suited to the drawing office, where she started as a tracer (tracing architectural drawings to copy them and add details for heating and ventilating systems). Her studies at Borough Polytechnic enabled her to progress to H&V; work for an architect‚Äôs office including estimating and supervising installation. During the WW2 she designed air raid shelters, factories and boat ventilation. In her spare time, she drove an ambulance. She went on to do a variety of jobs that allowed her to get practical bench and site experience until she was a fully qualified engineer and joined her father‚Äôs firm as a junior partner in 1945. Her father died in 1951, whilst engaged upon a major contract for the rebuilding of the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey after war damage, so Madeleine stepped up to become senior partner of W. J. Perkins & Partners, Consulting Engineers, and take over the firm on her own account and completed the contract.  Women's Engineering Society  She joined the Women‚Äôs Engineering Society in 1941 and was soon active on the council, running the London Branch (1950‚Äì52), and becoming president in 1959. She contributed many papers on heating and ventilation to The Woman Engineer and was active as a full member of a number of other engineering institutions. Although she was unable to attend the inaugural International Congress of Women Engineers and Scientists (ICWES) in New York in 1964, she did produce a most detailed survey of women engineers in the UK for the Congress. Her work was cited by the survey by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1971.  Personal Life  Nobbs married Denis Moody, also an engineer, in 1961. After Moody's death a few years later, she immersed herself in major building work to convert an old barn in Ipsden, Oxfordshire, into a home, doing most of the work herself. Nobbs died suddenly at the age of 56 in 1970.

He was born in the village of Patria, New York, in Schoharie County on 2 September 1868, and attended a rural school. Pollock started teaching during the winter at the age of 17. He continued working on the family farm until the age of 20. That year, he completed a high school curriculum in 31 weeks, and subsequently enrolled at Union College from which he graduated in 1895. While in college, Pollock competed in wrestling and sprinting. He went to the University of Leipzig for doctoral degree in biology, graduating in 1897. That same year, Pollock also finished a master's degree from Union College. Upon his return to the United States, Pollock taught biology, physics, and German at Albany High School until 1900. For the next seven years, Pollock was an examiner for the New York State Civil Service Commission. Starting in 1907, Pollock taught economics and biology at the New York State College for Teachers. He soon joined the Union College faculty to teach economics and sociology. By 1911, Pollock returned to the New York state government, specifically the Department of Mental Hygiene. Pollock streamlined record keeping and the use of psychometrics throughout the department. Pollock's work drew the attention of Surgeon General Rupert Blue, who asked him to do the same for the United States Army's newly established division of neurology and psychiatry in the midst of World War I. Pollock later devised a similar system for the state of Illinois. From 1915 to 1935, Pollock was editor of the Psychiatric Quarterly, after which he edited the Mental Hygiene News for the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene until retirement in 1943. Pollock was statistical consultant to the National Committee for Mental Hygiene for 25 years, and helped compile a statistical manual for hospitals jointly sponsored by the committee and the American Psychiatric Association. Pollock completed the same task for the American Association on Mental Deficiency. The American Association on Mental Deficiency granted Pollock membership status, and he was elected its president in 1943. Other societies to award Pollock membership included the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was named an honorary member of the American Psychiatric Association. Additionally, Pollock was a manager of the American Occupational Therapy Association, chairman of the International Committee on Mental Hygiene and the committee on statistics for the International Congress on Mental Hygiene. He also served on the medical council of the United States Veterans Bureau, and was elected a fellow of the American Statistical Association. Pollock died in Petersburg, Virginia on 8 May 1950.

Biography Born in London, Dunhill trained in Fine Art at the University of Reading under Sir Terry Frost and Rita Donagh. In the early 1970s she had a studio in Florence where she associated with some of the key figures in the Situationist International, including philosopher and filmmaker Guy Debord, the writer Gianfranco Sanguinetti and, later, the novelist and critic Mich√®le Bernstein. =Artistic career= Dunhill was primarily a landscape painter in her early career, and then explored more abstract forms, including mixed media artworks inspired by the surrealist ideas of chance and the found object. For much of her artistic career Dunhill maintained studios in London but she now lives and works in King's Lynn, Norfolk where she has a studio in the 15th century Hanseatic warehouse known as Hanse House. In 2015 she was awarded a residency at Despina (previously known as Largo das Artes), a contemporary art institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She has exhibited frequently, most recently in London in February 2019 with a solo exhibition of new and recent work; and in July 2019 she presented new works and installations with CUSP Artists at the Undercroft Gallery in Norwich. One of her drawings selected from the Women Artists Slide Library (WASL) was reproduced in The Women Artists Diary 1989.\\"The Women Artists Diary 1989\\". London, The Women's Press, 1988.

This thesis provides a detailed analysis of the six photographic books that Woodman compiled in her lifetime, and examines them in the context of surrealism which, Dunhill argues, was a significant influence on Woodman. Her study of Woodman's book Some Disordered Interior GeometriesWoodman, Francesca. Some disordered interior geometries.

Description This barnacle has six wall plates which are sculpted with vertical tube-like ribs which extend downwards onto the rock in projections rather like the edge of a thatched roof. The rostrum overlaps the wall plates and the terga form a beak when the barnacle is closed. There is a sinuous line at the junction between the tergum and the scutum. This is a large species of barnacle and can grow to a diameter of , but when densely packed together, individuals may be much taller than they are wide. The wall plates are white, greenish, brownish or gray. The base of the barnacle is little calcified so that when it is broken from the rock, a membrane and some soft tissues may be left behind. Distribution and habitat Thatched barnacles Semibalanus cariosus is native to the northern Pacific Ocean including Japan and the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, where its range extends from the Bering Sea to Morro Bay, California. It is found on rocks, pilings and other man-made structures from the mid-intertidal zone down to the shallow subtidal zone. In general, it occupies a belt below the zone occupied by Balanus glandula, often near beds of the California mussel (Mytilus californianus) and the bay mussel (Mytilus trossulus); it may be very numerous and is often the commonest organism in this belt. Ecology Like other acorn barnacles, S. cariosus is a filter feeder; when it is under water, the moveable terga at the apex part, and the cirri are extended to feed. When above water, the terga shut tightly for protection and to prevent desiccation. Small barnacles are sometimes \\"bulldozed\\" off the rock by the limpet Lottia digitalis while it is grazing. Predatory gastropod mollusks, such as the channeled dog winkle (Nucella canaliculata), drill into the barnacle shell and then inject a toxin which causes the muscles to relax, enabling the winkle to consume the soft parts. The winkles were more successful at gaining entry if they drilled between the wall plates of the barnacle rather than through them. Larger barnacles may be too big for the frilled dogwinkle (Nucella lamellosa), the purple seastar (Pisaster ochraceus) or the sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) to tackle. Human use Native Americans such as the Quinault people of Washington State used barnacles as a food resource, the staples of the diet in spring and summer being \\"clams, oysters, mussels, barnacles, roots, berries and fish\\". The shells of Semibalanus cariosus are found in their middens.

The company was in operation from 1883 until 1979. Many of Newcomb-Macklin's frames designed in the early 20th century reflected the esthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement that flourished in the United States between 1900 and 1925.Newcomb-Macklin frames were included in this 2011 exhibition in New York City of American frames produced during the Arts and Crafts period. Newcomb-Macklin frames in the arts and crafts style are today regarded as antiques and are often utilized by collectors and dealers to lend an air of authenticity to the framing of period American paintings.Article makes the case for the intrinsic value in antique frames, including early 20th century Newcomb-Macklin frames Company history Newcomb-Macklin Company's Chicago factory on State Street, circa 1900 The Newcomb-Macklin Company traced it roots to a regional frame manufacturer founded in 1871 in Evanston, Illinois by S. H. McElswain.Basic company history is presented in this catalog's introductory section. After twelve years in business, in 1883, McElswain sold his company to a partnership formed by the firm's bookkeeper, Charles Macklin, and John C. Newcomb. The partners relocated their business to Chicago, Illinois, where the company's production plant occupied a full city block at 400-408 N. State Street in the city's near north side. Sales were generated by a product showroom adjacent to the Chicago factory and by a traveling sales force. Within a few years the company also opened product showrooms in New York City and Glendale, California, though the Glendale location closed about 1940. Newcomb-Macklin Company ceased operation in 1979 when the assets of the company were acquired by Thanhardt-Burger Corporation of LaPorte, Indiana.Article records the date of Thanhardt-Burger's acquisition of Newcomb-Macklin Company. Thanhardt-Burger sold frames based on Newcomb-Macklin's designs until 2013, when the company's frame-making facility in LaPorte was destroyed by fire.Article summarizes Thanhardt-Burger's decision to cease operations following 2013 fire. Newcomb-Macklin product line Newcomb-Macklin picture frames were distinguished by their unique, perpendicular corner splines, a construction feature that prevented the corners of a frame from separating over time.Article in PDF format presents a visual description of a Newcomb-Macklin frame's distinctive corner construction. Basswood was the company's preferred wood for hand-carving, eventually giving way to poplar as the domestic supply of basswood dwindled in the 1960s. Newcomb-Macklin frames were gilded with a wide variety of gold leaf, silver leaf and metal leaf finishes. =Arts and Crafts style frames= Patterns for Newcomb-Macklin's arts and crafts style frames were conceived by an in-house stable of designers. These designs were then hand-carved into frame molding on the company's production floor and the frames assembled. This creative capability also enabled company craftsmen to produce frames that were designed according to a customer's specifications. Maxfield Parrish, Childe Hassam, George Bellows and John Singer SargentArticle states that some of Sargent's American portrait commissions were framed in Newcomb-Macklin frames. were among the company's most famous custom-order clients. Newcomb-Macklin designers incorporated motifs from as far away as New Mexico into their arts and crafts compositions, creating demand for these frames within the Taos art colony. =Classic frames= Much of Newcomb- Macklin's product line derived from the manufacture of exact copies of classic frames from a variety of periods and countries. Company sales literature promoted designs that were copied from colonial-period American frames, early American frames, Civil War-period American frames, French frames produced during the reigns of Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI, Dutch frames, Barbizon frames, 16th century Italian frames, and 17th century English frames.A number of early American and international styles, and time periods in which these frame styles evolved, are listed in this catalog and explicitly referred to as the sources of Newcomb-Macklin's classic frame designs. Newcomb-Macklin owned the rights to frames conceived by Stanford White, a nationally known American architect who was sensationally murdered in 1906, in New York, by Harry Kendall Thaw, and the company's sales literature promoted White's Renaissance-inspired designs. =Additional products= In addition to picture frames, the company manufactured a line of ornately framed mirrors, picture frame moldings for use in commercial frame shops, accent tables, and decorative specialties such as cornices and fan display boxes.

The Act provides for the lifelong anonymity of the victims and alleged victims of sexual offences, by prohibiting the publishing or broadcast of their identity, or information that might make their identity apparent, including their address or picture. Section 1 of the Act establishes the prohibition. Section 2 sets out the sexual offences covered, and has been amended since, including due to the wholesale redefinition of sexual offences in England and Wales by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Section 3 allows judges to waive anonymity on application from defendants and appellants if this is needed to help witnesses come forward or to avoid prejudicing their case, or if it is in the public interest.S. 1-3, as enacted This provision is very rarely used, though some victims waive their own anonymity to talk publicly about their cases. The Act was passed to address perceived deficiencies in an earlier and weaker form of identity protection for victims in cases of rape only, which had been established by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976. Convictions under the Act, generally resulting in fines, occur with some frequency, especially in high-profile cases where members of the public less familiar with the law than the press or broadcast media name accusers on social media, though charges are also brought against professional journalists. In some cases, such as where abuse has taken place within a family, the media may be unable to report the name of the offender, because this combined with details of the offence may indirectly reveal the identity of the victim.

African-American women mainly worship in traditionally black Protestant churches, with 62% identifying themselves as historically black Protestants. Many hold leadership positions in these churches and some lead congregations, especially in the American deep south. Black women also have served as nuns in the Catholic Church in the United States since the early 19th Century.  Contributions to Christianity  = Protestantism = Black women have been active in the Protestant churches since before the emancipation proclamation, which allowed slave churches to become legitimized. Women began serving in church leadership positions early on, and today two mainstream churches, the American Baptist Churches USA and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have women in their top leadership positions. Susan Gillies is the general secretary of the American Baptist Churches USA and Elizabeth Eaton is the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The Episcopal Church has had a female presiding Bishop before, as Katharine Jefferts Schori was Bishop from 2006 to 2015, and the United Methodist Church had a female President of the Bishops, Rosemarie Wenner. = Catholicism = Women are not allowed to hold priesthood office in the Catholic Church, so no Priests, Bishops, Cardinals, or Popes have ever been women. Women are allowed to serve as nuns, however, and many black women have chosen this path. In addition to this, a few black women from the very early days of the Church have been enshrined as Saints. The first Catholic women to found their own Religious communities were the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore.  Notable African and African- American women  = Sojourner Truth = Sojourner Truth was a female black lay minister for the Methodist church. She was freed from slavery after escaping in 1826, was one of the first black women to ever successfully sue a white man, and converted to Methodism in 1843. She delivered many speeches and sermons, the most famous of which was her 1851 address, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt I a woman?‚Äù She saved a Northampton camp meeting in 1844 when, while a small mob entered the encampment during a sermon of a different female preacher, she began to sing on a nearby hill and calmed both the worshipers and the mob, leading to the mob leaving. She delivered an address in Boston on the eighth anniversary of the Emancipation proclamation in which she admitted that although once hating white people for what they had done to her, and hating her masters, once she found her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love towards all people.Carlacio, Jami L. ‚Äú‚ÄòAren't I a Woman(Ist)?\\": The Spiritual Epistemology of Sojourner Truth.‚Äù Journal of Communication and Religion, vol. 39, no. 1, 2016.

Her husband founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and she was appointed as the frontwoman of the organization. In her memoir, King notes her role in helping and supporting her husband's profession of ecclesiastical leadership. She assisted in writing sermons and embraced, for the most part, the private practices of her husband, including a dedication to limit materialism in their lives.King, Coretta (2017). My Life, My Love, My Legacy. New York: Henry Holt and Co. . = Betsey Stockton = Betsey Stockton was an African American missionary and teacher in antebellum United States. She was raised by the President of Princeton, who noticed her intellect and granted her a spot at Princeton when she came of age. In 1822 she became a missionary and set sail with a group from the Princeton Theological Seminary to Hawaii. In doing this, Stockton became the first single female to set sail from America on a mission. She became the teacher of the first mission school opened to common Hawaiians. After returning to the United States in 1825, she helped found Princeton's First Presbyterian Church of Color.‚ÄúUndaunted Courage and Faith; The Lives of Three Black Women in the West and Hawaii in the Early 19th Century.‚Äù The Journal of African American History, vol. 91, no. 1, 2006. = Clara Brown = Clara Brown was a slave in Kentucky before she gained her freedom at age 56 and was required by law to leave. She as well as other African Americans fled to Denver. Brown was a key community and religious leader in Denver. She began holding prayer services in her home which eventually evolved into the formation of a non denominational Protestant Church. Her home was always open as a place of worship and refuge for those in need. Her nickname ‚ÄúAunt Clara‚Äù embodied the way her community viewed her and her efforts. She acquired large amounts of wealth by capitalizing on the need for services, especially laundry, and oftentimes used her wealth to benefit the community and poor. = Jane Elizabeth Manning James = Jane Elizabeth Manning James was born free in Connecticut and became a Presbyterian at a young age. She heard a sermon by a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, converted and was baptized to this sect in 1842. She had several unique, recorded spiritual experiences and eventually decided to move west in 1843. Denied their passage to Nauvoo by boat, she and nine other African-American members of the Church walked the 800 miles to Nauvoo to unite with the rest of their church. She endured the same persecution that other members of the Church of Jesus Christ endured at this time. James moved west with the Church in 1847, eventually settling in the Salt Lake valley, thereby becoming one of the first black women to live in Utah.‚ÄúJane Manning James:‚Äù Doctrine and Covenants 8, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Aug. 1979.

She was sold a slave in the mid 1700s as a child and was a slave much of her life. She learned to read and write and excelled at writing poetry. Her poetry made her very noteworthy and even garnered attention from ranking government members including President George Washington. Wheatley would write poems about political issues but was most well known for her religious writings. Wheatley was a pioneer of Christian writings, not to simply praise God, but to highlight the problem of slavery in a Christian context.‚Äú‚ÄòJustise Must Take Plase‚Äô: Three African Americans Speak of Religion in Eighteenth-Century New England.‚Äù The William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 56, no. 2, 1999, pp. 393‚Äì414. = St. Josephine Bakhita = St. Josephine Margaret Bakhita was born in 1869 in the Sudan. She was kidnapped in 1877 and became enslaved. She was brutally tortured while enslaved and was bought and sold several times until she was sold to the Italian Vice Consul in 1883, Callisto Legani. She moved to Italy with her owners shortly after that. When her mistress traveled to Sudan, she left Josephine in the care of Canossian Sisters in Venice. While here, Josephine became converted to Catholicism and refused to leave the Sisters. After gaining her freedom through legal action, she stayed at the monastery, becoming baptized and a nun. She worked at the monastery for 42 years, dying in 1947.

Revolutions forced her to Cuba where she received her education. She eventually moved to Baltimore where a relatively large population of French Speaking Blacks lived. She was lucky to have an education as a black woman in the United States, which was possible due to her father's wealth as a merchant. The free school that she created eventually transformed into a Catholic religious institution to educate young black women.

She recalls her conversion taking place during a sermon by a preacher named Richard Allen. Lee believed that her sins were taken away from her as the spirit of Christ was laid upon her. Lee had desires to spread the gospel that had changed her life and was appointed the first female to be a preacher in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her service as a missionary and a preacher slowed during her only marriage, but it picked up after her husband died shortly into the marriage.

Perpetua was a mother, and her own father attempted many times to convince her to renounce her faith and be freed, however she did not. Saturus, another Christian who was jailed with them, and Perpetua recorded the events in the prison and published this book, Passion of Saint Perpetua, Saint Felicitas, and their Companions.

Her mother died when she was four from a brain injury and her father was murdered when she was thirteen. Her education in New York was halted due to the economic crash in 1929. She was involved in New Deal programs like the WPA before she was able to try to go to school again at Harvard. She became a very prominent civil rights leader in the 1940s as she sought to be a lawyer to protect civil rights. She noted that the civil rights movement as well as church leadership was dominated by men. She was able to positively affect this issue as she became one of the first female Episcopal Priests in 1977. She was even able to go back to her hometown of Durham, North Carolina and preach her first sermon. She accomplished much in her life despite her being an orphan, being discriminated against because of her gender, and also struggling with her sexual identity. She died of pancreatic cancer in 1985.LowellMilkenCtr.

Leadership roles  = Women's leadership in Protestant denominations = In 1970, Black women held about 3% of leadership roles. By 1990, this figure had risen to 19%. In 1890, 7% of black women in Protestant churches were given full clergy rights, but 100 years later 50% had these same rights. Often, women do not receive the higher level or more visible roles. They are allowed to preach occasionally, and participate and preside over many rites and ordinances, but are not the leaders of the congregation.

It is an APS-C mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (MILC) designed to be a mid-range mirrorless camera and act as an update of the Œ±6300. Sony is targeting the vlogging community with the Œ±6400's flip-up screen and aggressive pricing. It features the same 24 megapixel sensor seen in the Œ±6500. At the time of release, the two most capable cameras in the Œ±6000 series of cameras were the Œ±6400 and the Œ±6500. The Œ±6500 featured IBIS, and a larger image buffer, but in most other respects the Œ±6400 is a more advanced camera. This is largely due to its processing power, enabling features like animal eye AF, and autofocus tracking. These features, for example, can not be added to the Œ±6300 via a firmware update, as it is too demanding a feature. At its announcement, the Sony Œ±6400 is advertised as featuring the \\"world's fastest autofocus\\" with lag of 0.02 second and 11 fps continuous shooting with continuous AF and 8 fps with the silent shutter. Its MSRP is $889 for the body and $998 with a 16‚Äì50 mm power-zoom kit lens f/3.5-5.6. Sony's Œ±6400 also saw a much-needed upgrade to the photo sharing apps and the reintroduction of time-lapse videos via the menu system. For video shooters, a welcome change for the Œ±6400 was the removal of the 30-minute record limit. This limit is an artificial one placed on many cameras to avoid being taxed differently. The Œ±6400 is also a vast improvement for Sony with regards to overheating (most likely to occur whilst recording 4K due to the processing demands). Online tests showed that in modest ambient temperatures, you will flatten the battery or fill the memory card before you overheat the camera. Firmware 2.0 was released for the Œ±6400 on 13 June 2019, introducing animal eye AF, the ability to use the wireless remote commander RMT-P1BT, as well as claimed stability improvements.

As well as possessing great beauty, they were all skilled in literature, poetry, fine arts, dancing and music. The name originates either from the 1693 book Banqiao Zaji () by Yu Huai (), or from the 19th century book Qinhuai Bayan Tuyong (), in which authors Zhang Jingqi () and Ye Yanlan () chose the eight most famous (in their view) courtesans of the period to be the subjects of the book. During the late Ming dynasty, elite courtesans challenged the gender stereotypes of Confucian values. In contrast to the women of the gentry, who were often discouraged from cultivating talent, lest it undermine their virtue as wives and mothers, the courtesans were educated in painting, poetry, and music. In addition, they owned property and participated in the public scene. Also known as The Elegant Eight of River Qinhuai and The Eight Great Courtesans of the Ming, the courtesans were Ma Xianglan (), (), Li Xiangjun (), Liu Rushi (), Dong Xiaowan (), Gu Hengbo (), () and Chen Yuanyuan (). The Eight Beauties =Ma Xianglan= Ma Xianglan () was born in Nanjing, and she lived in the entertainment district along the Qinhuai River. As a matriarch in courtesan society, she encouraged the education and training of courtesans in the arts. In order to maintain her reputation as an elite courtesan, she only allowed educated men or young student lords within her residence. At the age of 15, Ma Shouzhen formally assumed the position of courtesan. Before this, she may have received education from a proprietor during her childhood. As courtesan matriarch, she befriended many poets and intellects such as Peng Nian (; 1505‚Äì1566), Zhou Tianqiu (; 1514‚Äì1595), Xu Wei (1521‚Äì1593), Xue Mingyi (; late 16th century), and Wang Zhideng (; 1535‚Äì1612). The poets would write poems inspired by her or for her, describing Ma as beautiful with a warm and welcoming personality. During their visits, Ma Shouzhen joined them in making paintings, poems, and plays. She also hosted parties on her multi-leveled house-boat with the literati as her guests. =Bian Yujing= Bian Yujing () was a courtesan and painter in Qinhuai during the late Ming period. Born into an official family, the family hit hard times when her father died. Bian and her sister became singing girls to support themselves. Bian was adept at writing poetry, music, calligraphy and painting. She exchanged poems with author and poet Qian Qianyi. Chinese general Wu Sangui was amongst her patrons, as was poet Wu Weiye who from the 1630s to the 1660s wrote poems about Bian. After the Manchus invaded in 1644, Bian moved around the Yangtze area. She later took her vows and became a Daoist priestess. =Li Xiangjun= Painting of Li Xiangjun, 1817 Li Xiangjun () is also referred to as Li Ji () or Li Xiang () in contemporary sources. In order to demonstrate respect for her, later scholars appended the character jun () to her name. Her courtesy name was Shanzhui (). No written records from the time Li lived record where she was born, but popular modern theories suggest that she was the daughter of an official, who was demoted and his family either killed or sold. Li was adopted by the owner of a brothel in Nanjing called Meixiang House (), whose surname she took. She was taught to dance, sing, paint, play music, and write poetry. Meixiang House was a favoured brothel of the literati and officials, with Li's adopted mother known for her generosity and chivalry. By age 13, Li was renowned for her singing and playing the pipa that her mistress charged 20 gold taels per guest to see her. Li met Hou Fangyu at Meixiang House in 1648. Hou sent her poems and Li performed for him in return. When Hou left to sit the imperial examinations (which he failed), Li waited for him and refused to perform for the inspector general of Huaiyang County. Li's romance with Hou Fangyu has been called one of the greatest romances of Chinese history. =Liu Rushi= 1847 portrait of Liu Rushi, ink on paper, by Lu Ji and Cheng Tinglu Liu Rushi () is believed to have been born in Jiaxing, Liu was sold by her family as a concubine to the grand secretary (). At the age of thirteen, a scandal led to her expulsion from Zhou's household, and she was sold to a brothel in Suzhou. At seventeen, she had her first major love affair, with the painter Tang Shuda. Already a noted poet and painter herself at this early age, she met Chen Zilong () in 1635 and lived with him for about a year, eventually leaving after his family disapproved of their liaison. After leaving Chen, she managed a brothel in Wujiang. An affair with the artist Wang Janming ended when Wang failed to attend an appointment with her at the Rainbow Pavilion. Another affair with Song Yuanwen, a government official, ended when his vacillations over marriage resulted in Liu smashing her lute and storming off in a fit of pique. In 1640 Liu embarked on a campaign to marry the respected scholar Qian Qianyi. Dressed in men's clothing, she accosted Qian and requested his opinion on one of her poems. Qian apparently believed her to be a man, but later in the year he had established her at a specially built hermitage in the grounds of his Suzhou estate, called the \\"According to Sutra Studio\\". They married in 1641, whilst on a river cruise; Qian bestowing upon his bride the new name of Hedong. Although he married her as a concubine, Qian treated Liu as his principal wife, and they were married in a formal wedding ceremony. Her affinity for cross-dressing persisted after they were married; she regularly wore men's clothing whilst in public and on occasion made calls on her husband's behalf whilst dressed in his Confucian robes (this affectation earned her the nickname rushi (), \\"Confucian Gentleman\\", which also puns on her chosen name Rushi). =Dong Xiaowan= Dong Xiaowan painted by Yu Zhiding after her death Dong Xiaowan (1624‚Äì1651) was a Chinese courtesan, poet and writer, also known by her pen name Dong Qinglian (). Dong has been described as the most famous courtesan of her time, known for her beauty and talent in singing, needlework and the tea ceremony. She lived in the brothel district of Nanjing. Similar to other courtesans of the late Ming Dynasty, Dong's moral qualities were emphasised among her admirers more than her talents. Dong's mother died in 1642, leaving her to struggle financially. The noble (), also known as Mao Bijiang, had attempted to meet with Dong several times, but had pursued a relationship with the courtesan Chen Yuanyuan instead. After Chen was abducted by a noble associated with the imperial court, Mao visited Dong. Her mother had been dead for two weeks and Dong was quite ill. She proposed that she become his concubine and, refusing to take no for an answer, allegedly followed him for 27 days on his boat. Eventually, the two agreed to wait for Mao to pass the imperial examinations, which he failed. In order to facilitate Dong's marriage, Qian Qianyi, husband of fellow courtesan Liu Rushi, paid off her debts of 3,000 gold taels and had her name struck from the musicians' register. She then lived with Mao in Rugao as his concubine, alongside his wife Lady Su. She has been described as an ideal dutiful, sacrificing and loyal wife and daughter-in-law during her marriage to Mao Bijiang, who as a loyalist of the Ming dynasty was persecuted after the Qing dynasty's rise to power in 1644. When Mao, Lady Su and Dong were forced to flee their home in 1644, Dong abandoned her more valuable belongings to save her writings and paintings. They stayed in Huzhou until Zhu Yousong was crowned emperor in Nanjing later in 1644. Soon after, the household moved to Zhejiang, where Dong compiled a book titled Liuyan Ji () about jewellery, women's costumes, pavilions and parties. =Gu Hengbo= Gu Hengbo (), also known as Gu Mei () was born near Nanjing in 1619. At the beginning of the Chongzhen reign, Gu Mei became a courtesan in the Qinhuai River district of Nanjing. In her Tower Meilou in Qinhuai district in Nanjing, she hosted a famous literary salon, which counted Chen Liang, Qian Lucan and among its guests. Yu Huai described Meilou (literally house of bewitchment) as lavish and extravagant. She fell in love with one of her patrons, Liu Fang, promised to marry him and to end her career as a courtesan. When she later changed her mind, Liu Fang committed suicide. One of her patrons, the career official Gong Dingzi, paid 1,000 ounces of silver for her services. In 1643, she left her profession to become a concubine to Gong Dingzi and settled with him in the capital. His openly demonstrated love for her attracted much attention during their time, as it offended the norms of Confucian ideals, and her influence over him became legendary. She is known to have saved the Yan Ermei from execution, and to have been the benefactor of the artist Zhu Yizun. =Kou Baimen= Kou Baimen (), born in 1624 and also known as Kou Mei (; Mei was her given name, Baimen her courtesy name), was a famous Chinese courtesan known for her chivalry. Kou was a registered prostitute and when she was 18 or 19 her indenture was bought out by a high official, (), whom she married. The wedding was a lavish affair with 5,000 soldiers lining the route from Wuding Bridge to Zhu's home at Nei Bridge, but the marriage soon deteriorated. When the Ming dynasty fell to the Manchus in 1645, Zhu was arrested and imprisoned. Kou brought his freedom for 20,000 taels of gold. The payment for Zhu's release was seen as her buying herself out of the marriage. She then lived the life of a courtesan, receiving poets and statesmen in her garden studio. The poet () visited her in 1655 and wrote 3 poems for her. Kou was painted by many of the leading artists of the time. =Chen Yuanyuan= Statue of Chen Yuanyuan in Gold Hall Park in Kunming Chen Yuanyuan () was born to a peasant family in Jiangsu province, and on the death of her father, she became a courtesan. Chen became a leading figure in the Suzhou opera scene. In 1642, she became the lover of the scholar and poet Mao Xiang. Subsequently, Chen was bought by the family of Tian Hongyu, father of one of the Chongzhen Emperor's concubines. She was then either purchased for Wu Sangui by his father, or given to Wu as a gift by Tian. In April 1644, the rebel army of Li Zicheng captured the Ming capital of Beijing, and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide. Knowing that Wu Sangui's formidable army at Ningyuan posed a serious threat, Li immediately made overtures to gain Wu's allegiance. Li sent two letters to Wu, including one in the name of Wu's father, then held captive in Beijing. Before Wu Sangui could respond, he received word that his entire household had been slaughtered. Wu then wrote to the Qing regent, Dorgon, indicating his willingness to combine forces to oust the rebels from Beijing, thus setting the stage for the Qing conquest of China proper.

It was selected to compete for the Golden Bear at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival. The film loosely tells the story of Gareth Jones, a journalist from Wales, who in 1933 travels to the Soviet Union and uncovers the truth about the Holodomor, the man-made famine in Ukraine in which millions died. Plot In 1933, Gareth Jones is an ambitious young journalist who has gained some renown for his interview with Adolf Hitler. Thanks to his connections to Lloyd George, the former British prime minister, he is able to get official permission to travel to the Soviet Union. Jones intends to try to interview Stalin and to find out more about the Soviet Union's economic expansion and its apparently-successful five-year development plan. Jones is restricted to Moscow but jumps his train and travels unofficially to Ukraine to discover evidence of the Holodomor, including empty villages, starving people, cannibalism and the enforced collection of grain. On his return to Britain, he struggles to get his story taken seriously. The film ends by recording that Jones died in Mongolia on a return visit to the Soviet Union and did not know that his guide was employed by the Soviet secret service.

Baldessari was born on December 10, 1896 in Rovereto, Italy. In 1913, Baldessari began his career as a visual artist after studying in the Scuola Reale Elisabettiana. He participated in the Futurist movement among contemporaries including Fortunato Depero. In 1919, Baldessari moved to Milan where he studied architecture at Milan Polytechnic; he completed his degree in 1922. In 1923 Baldessari moved to Berlin where he worked as a set designer. In 1926, he returned to Milan and began his career in rationalist architecture. During this period, Baldessari designed a number of influential buildings including the Bernocchi Pavilion at the 10th International Fair of Milan and the Craja Bar in Milan (in collaboration with Luigi Figini, and Gino Pollini, Fausto Melotti and Marcello Nizzoli).

Second order equidensities do not normally show areas. * Equidensity series is a sandwich (in register) of a number of different equidensities. Usually each equidensity is coded by color or raster. Photographic and computerized image processing techniques Four techniques of obtaining equidensities are: * Tone separation process * Sabattier effect, also called pseudo-solarization * Agfacontour Professional film (discontinued) * Computerized LUTs Manipulating custom curves (U-curves) in photo-editing programs such as PhotoShop provide tools to obtain equidensities in digital image processing. Applications Interpretation or measurement of an image is sometimes aided by simplification of the density pattern.Applied Photography, Arnold et al, Focal Press, pages 422-426 This results in data reduction and enables keying (areas or lines with iso-densities to unique patterns, grey values or colours). This keying to singular grey- or colour values is known in modern image processing as using L.U.T.s. The fact that a certain density of a photographic layer has been caused by a specific amount of actinic radiation (visual light, UV-light, X-Rays, autoradiography, etc.) can be used to qualify and perform spatial measurements of a physical phenomenon. A calibrated photographic process is used to obtain quantitative measurements as well. Equidensitometry with Agfacontour made it possible to obtain reproducible equidensities similar to pseudosolarized photographic films and prints. The Agfacontour film contained two special emulsions with each different spectral sensitivity. Using color filters (yellow or magenta) during the exposure on Agfacontour one could control the width of the equidensity. By varying the exposure one could change the density in the image that showed on Agfacontour as equidensity. Although the material exhibited very low sensitivity (long exposures were necessary) the results were very reproducible and second order equidensities were sharp and clear, something that with pseudosolarization was almost impossible to achieve without special procedures.

Swan doors operate in a similar way to conventional car doors but unlike regular doors, they open at an upward angle. This design helps the doors to clear curbs, especially on lower sports cars, by opening slightly upward and away from the curb. The name comes from a car's resemblance with its doors open to a swan with its wings open. Aston Martin have used the design on many of their models, including the DB9, DB10, DB11, DBS V12, One-77, Rapide, Vantage, Vanquish, Virage, CC100 and the Vulcan. The design was also used by Aston Martin's sister company, Lagonda, on the Lagonda Taraf, as well as by other manufacturers on the Hennessey Venom GT, Vencer Sarthe and Pagani Huayra Roadster.

Education and career Day was born in 1889 in Chapel Hill, Missouri. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Central Missouri State Teachers College, and a master's degree in mathematics and statistics in 1927 from the University of Michigan School of Forestry and Conservation. She worked for the Victor Talking Machine Company from 1927 to 1929 before joining the United States Forest Service in 1930. In 1943 she moved to Johns Hopkins University to assist the war effort by helping develop a radio-based proximity fuze. After the war she became head of statistics at the United States Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, and later a consulting statistician for the Bureau of Ships. As part of her work for the Navy, she transferred her knowledge of the design of experiments from forestry to naval engineering, for example using this method to determine which types of steel were susceptible to cracks in welding. In 1960 she and her husband, contractor Charles E. Mauss, bought a house on South Carolina Avenue in Washington, DC, where they lived until retiring in 1969 to New Oxford, Pennsylvania. She died on September 14, 1986, in New Oxford. Recognition Day became a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1951 for being \\"diligent in the applications of statistical theory to the two widely separated fields of forestry and engineering\\". In 1958, she was elected to the Washington Academy of Sciences \\"in recognition of her pioneer work in the statistical design of experiments in many fields particularly those of forestry and engineering and for her unique achievements in the exposition of statistical methods\\". She was also a fellow of the American Society for Quality Control.

Life  Miroslav ≈†tolfa achieved his A-levels at grammar school in Brno-Husovice and between 1949 and 1953 studied art (taught by Prof. E. Mil√©n, B. S. Urban, and V. Makovsk√Ω) at the Faculty of Education at Masaryk University and history at the Faculty of Arts (taught by Prof. F. Stiebitz, J. Mac≈Ørek, and R. Holinka). After completing his studies, ≈†tolfa focused on painting and teaching at pedagogical schools in Boskovice, Ti≈°nov, and Brno. In 1955 he married his fianc√©e Vƒõra; they had a son, Jarom√≠r and a daughter, Jana. In the same year, his first solo exhibition took place in the Education Employees Club in Brno. In 1963 he co-founded the creative group Parabola which was gradually joined by a number of important Brno artists (A. ƒåalkovsk√Ω, R. Fila, R. Hlinƒõnsk√Ω, D. Chatrn√Ω, J. Jankoviƒç, Z. Mach√°ƒçek, E. Ovƒç√°ƒçek, M. Urb√°sek, D. Valock√Ω, K. Veleba, V. Zykmund, and others). V√°clav Zykmund was both group theorist and spokesperson. At that time Miroslav ≈†tolfa was teaching at the Department of Art Theory and Education at the Faculty of Arts at Palack√Ω University in Olomouc. In 1966, he was named an assistant professor in painting on basis of his degree. During the 1960s, ≈†tolfa undertook several foreign study trips (Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Austria, and Spain). Between 1978 and 1983, he taught drawing and painting at the Department of Aesthetic Education at the Faculty of Education at Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ University in Brno (now Masaryk University). From 1979 he was an assistant professor there. At the age of 53, he left his pedagogical activities and from then on he devoted himself exclusively to his own works of art. In 1990, ≈†tolfa co-founded the artists‚Äô association ‚ÄúTT klub‚Äù whose members were not only artists born in the 1950s but also a few art theorists (R. Hor√°ƒçek, J. Valoch, I. Zho≈ô). In 1992, he participated in the founding of the Institute of Fine Arts at the Faculty of Architecture, Brno University of Technology and until 1993 he was head of the newly established painter‚Äôs studio. ≈†tolfa‚Äôs body of work includes an extensive collection of paintings and drawings based on a thorough knowledge of avant-garde movements. The importance of his work grew beyond the borders of his own region. Throughout his life, he arranged 50 solo exhibitions and participated in 170 collective exhibitions, of which more than 70 were abroad. Miroslav ≈†tolfa lived and worked in Brno.  Work  Miroslav ≈†tolfa had painted since his early childhood and he was interested in the periphery of Brno with a marshalling yard, the Masaryk circuit and the unspoiled landscape of the Vysoƒçina region from which his ancestors had come from. During his studies, he was greatly influenced by the Group 42 and Cubist movements. In his first creative phase, ≈†tolfa painted recesses of the city of Brno with subdued colours, but his affinity to machines and technical civilization soon prevailed, which was also reflected in his paintings of the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, he was fascinated by the ambience of motor racing and motorcycles (The Racing Driver, The Depot, The Engine cycles of pictures), cars and airplanes. Later he was also riveted by large industrial buildings (the Power Stations cycle of pictures). He gradually broke away from a compilation of civilizational and technical forms and symbols which was an original theme of the cycles of pictures, and from the real environment, and by the end of the 1960s, he reached an abstract way of expression and exploration of general relationships, forces and movements. In the 1970s, besides painting, ≈†tolfa devoted himself also to black and white large-format charcoal and ink drawings depicting fictitious mechanical devices and their components. From the beginning of the 1980s, there appeared featured stylized figures in his paintings too, such as those marked by racing overalls. In 1981, ≈†tolfa started working on the cycle of images named The New Nature. In his artistic reflection, technology had become a decisive factor that had shaped the environment to be pictured. The painter considered the opportunities offered by technology to humans as well as its dark side which is accompanied by a catastrophe caused by its misuse. This cycle of 35 paintings was exhibited at the House of Arts in Brno in 1984 and the title The New Nature has become the common name for other exhibitions dealing with civilizational themes. Also in other cycles of paintings focusing on landscape, technology is depicted as an element of art or a metaphor. Nevertheless, this inspiration was shifted to the level of general features, and the paintings were dominated by rational reflection and artistic sensitivity (the Horizons, Painting Studios, Signals, Landscape of Machine Hoods, Movements in the Landscape, and Vistas cycles). From the end of the 1990s, ≈†tolfa‚Äôs work became less concrete when displaying reality. His paintings gained a meditative character; referring to oppressive aspects of human existence (The Victim, 2002, A Memento, 2007), indicating feelings of loneliness (A Hermit, 2009) or showing the theme of a rebellion and a fall (The Story of Icarus, 2011). In some of his other paintings he came back to the symbols of buildings and stations of the periphery of Brno (The Landscape of My Childhood). The work of Miroslav ≈†tolfa presents the entire aspects of technical civilization, from hope and admiration to negative consequences for the environment, the loss of illusions, and feelings of alienation. Nevertheless, his work also offers hope and better prospects with the inclination to meditative motifs and the reflection of the invisible. = Paintings = File:01) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Memento, 1980.jpg Memento, 1980 File:03) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Nov√° p≈ô√≠roda, 1985.jpgNew Nature, 1985 File:06) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Zdvojen√Ω horizont, 1997.jpgDouble horizon, 1997 File:12) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Zaml≈æen√Ω horizont, 2000.jpgMisted horizon, 2000 File:14) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Velk√© torzo, 2002.jpgBig torso, 2002 File:27) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Metafyzick√© z√°ti≈°√≠ VI, 2012.jpgMetaphysical still life VI, 2012 File:33) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Vzlet modr√©, 2012.jpgAscent of Blue, 2012 File:39) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Na t√©ma figury, 2013.jpgOn the theme of figure, 2013 = Drawings = File:01) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Kapot√°≈æ, 1978, uhel, 61x86.jpgHooding, 1978, charcoal 61 x 86 cm File:04) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Bez n√°zvu, 1986, uhel, 86x61.jpgNo name, 1986, charcoal , 86 x 61 cm File:14) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Kapotovan√° krajina, 1993, uhel, 65x100.jpgHooded countryside, 1993, charcoal , 65 x 100 cm File:17) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Nov√° p≈ô√≠roda, 1999, uhel, 86x61.jpgNew Nature, 1999, charcoal, 86 x 61 cm File:20) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Zaƒç√°tek pohybu, 1999, uhel, 86x61.jpgStart of traffic, 1999, charcoal, 86 x 61 cm File:22) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, F√°tum, 1999, uhel, 100x70.jpgFatum, 1999, charcoal, 100 x 70 cm File:27) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, N√°v≈°tƒõvn√≠k, 2009, uhel, pap√≠r, 100x70.jpgVisitor, 2009, charcoal, 100 x 70 cm File:28) Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Okno, 2009, uhel, pap√≠r, 100x70.jpgWindow, 2009, charcoal, 100 x 70 cm = Public collections = * National Gallery in Prague * Moravian Gallery in Brno * Museum Bochum * Albertina Wien * Landesmuseum Nieder√∂sterreich, Wien * Galerie Artica, Cuxhaven * Print Consortium, San Jos√© * Ale≈° South Bohemian Gallery, Hlubok√° nad Vltavou * Muzeum of Fine Arts Olomouc * Regional Gallery of Fine Arts, Zl√≠n * Regional Gallery of Fine Arts, Jihlava * Regional Gallery of Fine Arts, Nov√© Mƒõsto na Moravƒõ * Regional Gallery of Fine Arts, Hodon√≠n * Regional Gallery of Fine Arts, Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod * West Bohemian Gallery, Plze≈à (Pilsen) * Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic = Selected collective exhibitions abroad = * 1988 21 zeitgen√∂ssische Maler aus S√ºdm√§hren, Staatlichen Lindenau-Museum , Altenburg * 1989 Suvreme ƒåehoslovaƒçko slikarstvo, Galerija Karas, Zagreb * 1992-2002 Minisalon, Galerie Nov√° s√≠≈à, Praha, Art and Culture Centre, Hollywood, Los Angeles, Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, Courtyard Gallery, New York City, Chicago Cultural Center, Indianapolis Museum of Art, The Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg (Florida), Gallery of Fine Arts, Fort Myers (Florida), McKissick Museum, Columbia (South Carolina), National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library, Cedar Rapids (Iowa), University Art Gallery, North Dartmouth (Massachusetts), Jonson Gallery, Albuquerque (New Mexico), Telfair Museum of Art, Savannah (Georgia), Biblioth√®que royale de Belgique, Brussels, Prague Castle, Galeri Nasional Indonesia, Jakarta, Museum Puri Lukisan, Ubud, Majapahit Mandarin Hotel, Surabaya, Centre tch√®que Paris * 2000 Schenkungen, Museum Bochum * 2002 La Boh√™me en voiture, Mus√©e national de l'automobile, Mulhouse * 2016 Blickpunkt Abstrakt, Barockschloss, Riegersburg  Notes  * translation from Czech Wikipedia  References  * Miroslav ≈†tolfa, Gabrielov√° B et al., cz., en., 127 pp., 102 phot., Moravian Gallery Brno 1997, * Jaroslav Malina (ed), Ji≈ô√≠ Hlu≈°iƒçka: Miroslav ≈†tolfa, 255 pp., Akademick√© nakladatelstv√≠ CERM v Brnƒõ 2017, * Diderot vol.

Life Neumann was born in P√°pa, Hungary, to his father Rabbi Yosef ben Benzion Neuman who was a student of R‚Äô Yeshaya Silberstein in V√°c/Weitzen, and the Shevet Sofer in Pressburg. Rabbi Yosef served as Rav in Transylvania (Sepsiszentgyorgy, Deva, Brasso), and then in √ìbuda district of Budapest. He passed in 1964 in P√°pa. His mother Chayla Gele was a daughter of R‚Äô Avraham Bick Ztz‚ÄùL from Presburg Bratislava who was great in Torah and made many Seforim. His mother was a niece of Rav Yitzchak Yaacov Reines. Rav Neuman was named Yitzchok Yaakov at birth but reversed his name because he did not want to be named after his uncle.\\"Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Neiman.\\" Kevarim of Tzadikim in North America In his youth, he was a student of Reb Yankel Klamka, who was the secretary to the Vayaged Yaakov (Rav Yaakov Yechizkiah Greenwald, ztz‚Äùl, the second Pupa Rebbe and rabbi of the Adass Yisroel congregation in P√°pa). Neumann was then sent to be the Vayeged Yaakov's student in his own Yeshiva in P√°pa, and of his (The Vayeged Yaakov's) son, the Vayechi Yosef (Rav Yosef Greenwald, ztz‚Äùl, the third Pupa Rebbe, who, after losing his wife and ten children in the Holocaust, rebuilt the Chassidus in the United States). The Rav was (first marriage) son in law of R‚Äô Shia Grunwald, Son of R‚Äô Yida Grunwald ‚Äì Son-in-law of R‚Äô Nuchem Grunwald, both were children of R‚Äô Amram Grunwald of Csorna son of R‚Äô Yosef Grunwald, Tshetsowitz Rav. He had one child Nuchem who perished in the Holocaust. After the war he remarried to Devorah Rachel, the youngest daughter of Rabbi Yaakov Yechezkia Greenwald, who lived in Chust, the brother of the Arugat HaBosem, sons of above mentioned R‚Äô Amram Grunwald. but did not have children. Rabbi Neumann was a Belzer Hasid.  Rabbinical career  After surviving the Holocaust, in which his wife and only son, Nuchem, was killed, Rabbi Neumann served as head of the remaining Hungarian P√°pa community (abt. 1948), from which he gained the title, Puper Rav. Rabbi Neumann then emigrated to Australia, and founded the Haredi community in Melbourne. After serving briefly as their rabbi, the Puper Rebbe (charismatic leader of all the Pupa Hasidim) suggested Neumann's appointment in Montreal's Belzer community, to which the Belzer Rebbe approved. Rabbi Neumann arrived in Montreal in 1953 in the company of several followers from Melbourne, and helped guide the bourgeoning Belzer community. In Montreal, most of the Belzer Hasidic community is of Hungarian origin (though the town of Belz itself can now be found in Western Ukraine). The community's initial humble beginnings in Montreal greatly expanded following the Second World War. The Montreal Shtiebel (a small house of prayer and study) for the Belzer Hasidim is the Hassidei Belz Umachzikei Hadas (Hasidim of Belz and Upholders of the Faith), located on Jeanne-Mance in Mile End. Since Neumann's death, the community has expanded and built another Shtiebl. Known as the ‚Äúkleiner/kichi‚Äù (small) Puper Rav due to his short stature (3‚Äì4 ft.), Rabbi Neumann became the head of the Montreal Belz kehilla (community). Well-liked for his good-natured personality and clever wit, Rabbi Neumann served in Montreal until his death. His influence outside Montreal was evident when after his passing he was mourned by the Pupa Hasidim of New York. He died on 7 Shvat 5767, at the age of 87 without children. He is buried next to the Ohel of his Rebbe, the Vaychi Yosef of Pupa, in Kiryas Pupa, in Ossinning, New York.  Sources  * Bauer, Julien, ‚ÄúLes communaut√©s hassidiques de Montr√©al.‚Äù Dans P.

The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire. Background = Colombian conflict = The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot√° lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell√≠n drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent. Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing. = Peace dialogue = The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants. = ELN in Venezuela = According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv√°n M√°rquez participated in the talks with the ELN. In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \\"ELN‚Äôs expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration‚Äôs inaction and even encouragement towards the group\\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci√≥n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members. Events = Planning = Attorney General identified the perpetrator as Jos√© Aldemar Rojas Rodr√≠guez, known as \\"Mocho Kiko\\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac√°. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives. Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory. = Attack = The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device. In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan √ösuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents. = Initial investigations = On 18 January, Defence Minister identified Rojas Rodr√≠guez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand. A second individual, who Attorney General Mart√≠nez said \\"had participated in the attack\\", was arrested in Bogot√° at 2:30am on the day following the attack. The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \\"combatant's manual\\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked. According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot√° and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past. = Peace dialogue ends = President Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties. The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \\"concrete response\\" from the government of Nicol√°s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \\"evasive positions\\" when speaking about the ELN. =Claim of responsibility= ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility. International reactions A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens. * Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \\"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\\". * Ecuador: President Len√≠n Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic√≥, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot√° accompanied by Chic√≥'s relatives. * Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot√° expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected. * United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \\"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot√° offered its \\"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\\". Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.

Folge, in Magie (German Magic Circle), Issues 1951 - 1958 He opened a magic shop in London in 1873, and a magic shop/factory in Brussels in 1878. One of Cl√©mentine's sisters was the French actress √âlise de V√®re (1879-1917). The family moved to Paris in 1892 where Charles de V√®re opened another magic shop which he ran until about 1909, assisted by his sons. Here Cl√©mentine de V√®re was said to have been influenced by the artists of the Folies Berg√®re. On 5 May 1904 aged only 15 she eloped with and married the American circus artist and tamer Herman Weedon (actually: Herman Armond Wirtheim, 1876-1959) from the Bostock Circus.Cl√©mentine de V√®re on Magic Tricks websiteErin Morgenstern, The Night Circus, Vintage, (N.D) - Google Books In June 1904 the newly-married couple travelled to New York as Weedon had a commitment on Coney Island. It is possible that she accompanied him in the following years on his professional travels, which also took him to Egypt and the Belgian Congo. From her marriage with Weedon she had a son, Frank H. Weedon (1907-1984), who later was known under the name Frank Wirtheim Tchitcherine. It would appear that Cl√©mentine de V√®re did not travel with Weedon in 1909, but she and her brother Camille (1885-1909) were working in their father's magic business in Paris until Camille died of diabetes mellitus. Charles de V√®re then gave up his business and retired to Rosny-sous- Bois, where he apparently worked on the preparation of a big show for his daughter. \\"Ionia\\" The Sphinx March 1911 On 30 January 1911 she appeared on stage for the first time as \\"Ionia\\", later sometimes billed as \\"the Enchantress\\" or as the \\"Goddess of Mystery\\", in an act at the Birmingham Hippodrome in England in a routine which required six tons of equipment and elaborate Egyptian costumes for Cl√©mentine and her male and female assistants.\\"Ionia\\" on Magic Poster GalleryAmy Dawes (2007) The Female of the Species, Early Popular Visual Culture, 5:2, 127-150, DOI: 10.1080/17460650701433780 \\"Ionia\\" had great success and that year her act was seen in Vienna, Berlin, Paris and other venues. Her last contemporary mention was apparently in the March 1911 issue of the magazine The Sphinx the cover of which showed a photograph de V√®re. The text in this issue dealt with her appearance in Manchester. The sudden disappearance of \\"Ionia\\" from the stage may have been related to the closure of the Folies Bergere of New York. This theatre was opened in the spring of 1911 and had to close again in October of the same year because of financial difficulties. Apparently Cl√©mentine de V√®re had a contract with this theatre and after its closure could not find suitable employment.Greene, p 73 The last recorded appearance of Cl√©mentine de V√®re as \\"Ionia\\" was in Vienna, this time in a pantomime. Following this Charles de V√®re was disappointed that his daughter had not continued her elaborate act and tried to sell the tricks and pieces of equipment to curb the financial losses that had arisen for him.Charles Greene III, 'Ionia. The Queen of Mystery' Magic, December 2006, p. p. 70 Marriage and divorce Decorative poster for the magic act \\"Ionia\\" c1911 She met a Russian-Georgian Prince Vladimir Eristavi Tchitcherine in Austria in 1913 and married him on 21 June 1919 in Paris, after her first marriage had been dissolved on 23 June 1917. The claim of her father that she had stayed in Moscow during the Russian Revolution appears to be untrue. In the 1920s Cl√©mentine de V√®re lived temporarily with her second husband in Washington, DC and later in Paris. On 26 October 1928 this second marriage too was dissolved, but Cl√©mentine de V√®re retained the title of Princess, which she had received by the marriage. She lived in Monaco and France for the rest of her life and was buried next to her parents in Batignolles Cemetery in Paris, France after her death in 1973. Although her stage career was relatively short, lasting just three years, \\"Ionia's\\" act was spectacular, filling the stage with illusions. Her act was advertised with beautiful posters which many collectors consider to be some of the most artistic posters of magic‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Age.‚Äù Of the 22 known posters for \\"Ionia\\" produced by Moody Brothers of Birmingham, only about nine have survived and are now considered expensive collectibles.Ionia \\"The Enchantress\\" - All About Magicians websiteSale of a poster advertising Clementine de Vere - Ionia - L‚ÄôEnchantresse References Bibliography *Charles Greene III, 'Ionia.

He provides legal commentary in print and on television. He has appeared on programs such as Hardball with Chris Matthews, The Ingraham Angle, Tucker Carlson Tonight, The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, and CBS This Morning. A former prosecutor himself, Varghese, however, is an outspoken critic of the nearly unlimited power of prosecutors. On March 21, 2020, the New York Daily News published an op-ed that Varghese wrote blasting Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision not to include criminal defense lawyers as \\"essential\\" in Cuomo's COVID-19 shutdown order. The next day, criminal defense lawyers were deemed \\"essential.\\"  Academics  Varghese graduated from Chaminade High School. He earned his B.A. in Philosophy from New York University (NYU). Three years after graduating from NYU, he enrolled at Brooklyn Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.).  Career  After his graduating law school in 2000, Varghese began his legal career as a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, where he worked in the trial bureaus, investigations, and appeals. His last position there was running a unit called the Assault on Police Officer Program, which prosecuted attempted murders of NYPD officers. Since February 2006, Varghese has been working as a criminal law defense attorney at Varghese & Associates, P.C located on Wall Street. Varghese has defended multiple high-profile clients. In 2013, Varghese defended Rengan Rajaratnam, the younger brother of Galleon hedge fund king, Raj Rajaratnam, on insider trading charges. In 2014, Varghese defended New York City Councilman Daniel Halloran who was described by then U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara as the ‚Äúquarterback‚Äù of a scheme to put a Democrat, Malcolm Smith on the Republican ticket for New York City Mayor.[2] Varghese later criticized Bharara for his pretrial comments to The New York Times. During the trial, the New York Times noted that Varghese‚Äôs cross-examination of an FBI agent led to a mistrial. During the cross, the agent admitted there were multiple recordings of an informant the government hadn‚Äôt turned over to the defense. This led to multiple mistrial motions, which Southern District Judge Kenneth M. Karas ultimately granted. From 2009-2015, Varghese represented Tomas Olazabal, a construction company owner charged with tax fraud by the Department of Justice‚Äôs Tax Division. Olazabal was initially convicted at trial due in large part, to prosecutorial misconduct, but Varghese successfully petitioned the trial judge, Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York to grant a rare Rule 33 motion for a new trial. The government then appealed the conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. There, Varghese successfully beat back the government‚Äôs appeal. The DOJ Tax Division then retried Olazabal. The second time around, Varghese secured a complete acquittal. In 2019, Varghese represented Christopher Gooley, a juror on the Chanel Lewis murder retrial in Queens. Lewis, a young black man with a history of mental illness was convicted in a retrial of murdering young Italian American jogger, Karina Vetrano. The case garnered international attention due to the racial optics of the case and Lewis‚Äô mental state. Gooley, shortly after voting guilty spoke with reporters and told them that he was unsure about his verdict and accused the other white jurors of allowing race and other factors to influence their guilty verdict. [6] Varghese is also a regular legal commentator on multiple news networks. These include CBS News, Fox Business, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC,, Court TV, BBC, i24,TRT World, Canadian TV, HLN, and The Today Show Australia. Varghese also guest hosted on Vanity Fair's True Crime series, where he fact checked various financial crime scenes ranging from The Wolf of Wall Street to Billions.  Op-Eds  Varghese writes frequently and has had his op-eds published by a variety of news outlets, including the New York Law Journal, Law.com, the New York Daily News, and the New York Post. Major television outlets like Fox News have also interviewed Varghese about his op-eds. Fox News invited Varghese on to discuss New York Governor Cuomo‚Äôs failure to designate lawyers as ‚Äúessential‚Äù during the Coronavirus pandemic. On May 29, 2020, he wrote an op- ed about the Manhattan DA engaging in selective prosecution by prosecuting Yasmin Seweid in 2016 for a false criminal report, but not Amy Cooper in the Central Park ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù incident. He also blasted the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA) for advocating for forced adult vaccines, if a COVID-19 vaccine were ever developed. In the same op-ed, he criticized NYSBA for not advocating for its members, lawyers in general, when it refused to fight Cuomo‚Äôs executive order, designating lawyers as non- ‚Äúessential.‚Äù  Work in the community  Varghese served as president of Chaminade High School's Alumni Lawyers Association from September 2017 through August 2019. He has also acted as an alumni mentor to New York University's College of Arts and Science students since 2014 and taught clinical students from Brooklyn Law School and Hofstra School of Law. He has taught trial advocacy at Harvard Law School,Cardozo Law School, and for the New York City Law Department.

Nardulli (November 28, 1948 ‚Äì June 27, 2018) was an American endocrinologist known for her research into the role of estrogen in breast cancer. Biography Ann Wannemacher was born in 1948 in Morrison, Illinois, to Rita and Rudolph Wannemacher of Hooppole. She received a bachelor of science degree in education at Northern Illinois University and taught elementary school in Addison before earning master's and doctoral degrees at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and completing postdoctoral work there in biochemistry. Nardulli joined the university's lab run by Benita Katzenellenbogen, and eventually became a professor of the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology with her own lab, teaching and studying the effects of estrogen in women. = Notable research = Nardulli's work concentrated on the specifics of estrogen activities, including the proteins it binds with, and the mechanisms that the hormone uses to manipulate chromatin and DNA. According to Katzenellenbogen, > ‚ÄúDr. Nardulli did pioneering work that identified the protein complexes with > which the estrogen receptor associated, many previously unknown, and she and > her laboratory associates went on to elucidate how these proteins > collaborated with and modulated the activities of the estrogen receptor in > breast cancer cells and tumors.\\" Among the research topics explored by her team were the plasma membrane proteins and their effect on breast cancer cells as well as the proteins that these cells secrete. Later research focused on the brain and estrogen action in it. At the university, Nardulli \\"was particularly fond of spending time with the Hormone Chixx, a group of women from across campus who studied the effects of hormones in the body. She discovered that introducing students to the wonders of human physiology and endocrinology was extremely rewarding and was recognized for her teaching excellence.\\" = Advocacy = As an active member of the Endocrine Society, she served as \\"chair of the Advocacy and Public Outreach Core Committee and visited Washington, D.C., numerous times to meet with legislators on Capitol Hill and lobby for increased scientific research funding.\\" She was also a member of the society‚Äôs Scientific Statements Task Force and a member of the editorial board for the academic journal Endocrine Reviews and Molecular Endocrinology.

For the rest, the aircraft, which was identified by the company with the initials FF 46, maintained the same engine, the Mercedes D.III engine, and the same offensive armament based on a pair of synchronised LMG 08/15 Spandau machine guns chambered for the standard cartridge of the period, the 7.92 √ó 57 mm Mauser, firing through the propeller disc. After submitting the preliminary draft to Idflieg in September 1916, the company obtained an order for three aircraft to be submitted for evaluation tests. The first and second prototype, while maintaining the same velatura biplana at positive scaling, differed due to the different solution in the central link of the wing plane higher than fuselage, where the montantini perpendicular to the first one were substituted with those divaricated in the second one to allow a better visual field to the [pilot aviator], while the two wing planes were connected to each other by a one pair per side of interlocking posts. The two prototypes supported a series of tests until April 28, 1917, revealing that the aircraft possessed flight characteristics and lower performance than those already in line, so no subsequent supply order was issued and the project was abandoned. There is no definite information on the use of the third prototype, nor has it ever actually been completed.

It is situated on the shared boundary of Olympic National Park with Mount Skokomish Wilderness, and is the highest point of the wilderness. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Stone, to the northeast. It is visible on the Olympic skyline from as far away as Seattle. Mt. Skokomish has three summits, the south peak being the highest. Precipitation runoff drains into the Hamma Hamma River and Skokomish River. Like the river, the mountain's name honors the Skokomish people. Mount Skokomish seen from Mount Stone Climate Mount Skokomish is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger.

Folia Parasitologica, 33, 199-206. PDF Due to the lack of detail in the original description, Microcotyle peprili was redescribed and illustrated based on 10 specimens from the type-host off Chesapeake Bay. McMahon added some anatomical features not noted in the distorted type- specimen. Morphology Microcotyle peprili has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with an elongate fusiform body tapered toward the anterior end and the haptor-bearing region, provided with a thin and smooth tegument, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The tapering haptor is 0.12 mm long, and bears about 175 clamps similar in shape, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two lateral muscular buccal suckers anterior to the pharynx at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a spherical pharynx, an esophagus extending just posterior to the genital atrium, and a posterior intestine with two lateral branches ramified laterally and fusing in a single peduncle that extends into the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an genital atrium, armed with numerous conical spines arranged in concentric circles, opening near anterior end, a single relatively long ovary, a uterus, vitelline glands that extends along both sides from the genital atrium to the beginning of the haptor and are joined posteriorly, and 13-24 testes which are posterior to the ovary. The eggs are elongate with a short filament at both poles. Etymology The specific name peprili is derived from the generic name of the host species Peprilus paru (currently Peprilus alepidotus). Diagnosis According to Pearse (1949), Microcotyle peprili can be differentiated from other species of the genus Microcotyle by the number of clamps, characters of the haptor and by the spines of the genital atrium.

Causes The late nineteenth century was a period of instability in Colombian politics, with seven civil wars fought between 1851 and 1895. The reorganisation of the country into a more unitary structure, without the separate state armies that had caused chaos earlier, also resulted in the Liberal party being marginalised in congress. During the period 1892-1896, the Colombian Liberal Party was represented in the Congress by Luis Antonio Robles, while the presidency was occupied by Miguel Antonio Caro, a member of the National Party, after the retirement of Rafael N√∫√±ez for health reasons. The latter died in Cartagena 18 September 1894, leaving a power vacuum that contributed to the outbreak of conflict. Upon taking office, Caro took unpopular measures under Law 61 of 1888, known as the \\"Law of Horses.\\" Individual liberties and freedom of the press were reduced, censorship was introduced, and the government could arrest its political enemies without trial, arresting some and banishing others. On the night of 22 of January 1895, the director of the new National Police of Colombia, the French director Jean Marie Marcelin Gilibert, foiled a coup plot, arranged from exile in Cura√ßao by the liberal General Avelino Rosas Cordoba, to arrest President Caro. Many of the coup plotters were arrested, with those who escaped fleeing to Facatativa, where General Siervo Sarmiento was based. Despite this foiling of Cordoba's plan, on 29 January 1895, the Liberals rose under the command of General Servant Sarmiento. Course of the conflict The Liberal revolt failed in a short amount of time due to a lack of organisation, weapons, manpower and official support. Both the Army and the National Police sided with the government. The rebel forces, on the other hand, were comprised in large part of poorly-armed students and artisans. The rebels of the department of Cundinamarca were defeated at the battle of La Tribuna on 29 January 1895. On the same day rebels in the north of Tolima at Espinal, in Honda and in Ambalema were defeated by General Casabianca, reorganised themselves in Gualanday but were again defeated at Ibague. From there they advanced to Ambalema where they joined the rebels who had retreated from La Tribuna. These rebel forces later surrendered together. In Boyac√°, the rebels were led by Pedro Mar√≠a Pinz√≥n, who marched with the forces from the west of the department (some 1,600 men) to Tunja to join those from the north. Pinzon won a victory against government forces at Soto leaving the road to Tunja open, but did not advance on Tunja, instead joining with the forces from the north of the department (‚âà1,400 in strength) at Duitama. From there they marched to join forces with the rebels of Santander, but reversed course along the way and returned to El Cocuy. In Santander, whilst the rebels within the province were not of any great strength, a significant invasion by Colombian emigres based in the Venezuelan town of Rubio invaded the province of C√∫cuta on 29 January and a week later defeated government forces at Bagalal, and then advanced to capture the towns of Rosario and C√∫cuta. On 18 February, approximately 2,000 rebels left C√∫cuta heading south, under the command of Generals Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruiz and Pedro Soler Mart√≠nez, with the intent of joining forces with those of Boyac√°. They marched via Pamplona, C√°cota de Velasco, Silos, Guaca, San Andr√©s and M√°laga. At Enciso on 15 March the rebels encountered a 3,000-strong government force under General Rafael Reyes who had been following the same route as them, a bloody struggle ensued in which more than 1,000 men were killed before the government forces emerged victorious. Aftermath General Rafael Reyes benefited greatly from the heightened reputation he had earned from his victories, and went on to become president of Colombia. However, the victory over the Liberals did not permanently settle the conflict within Colombian society, which within a few years was again embroiled in civil war - this time in the Thousand Days' War.

He is recognized for his research on marine picoplankton, marine macroecology, ocean surveys of plankton from measurements of flow cytometry, and detection of multi-annual ecological change in marine phytoplankton.  Early life and education  Li was born in 1952 in British Hong Kong and became a citizen of Canada by naturalization in 1973. His paternal grandfather was Li Tse-fong. His maternal grandfather was O. K. Yui. His primary education was at Kuang Chi School in Manila, and at the Diocesan Boys‚Äô School in Kowloon. His secondary education was at St. Paul‚Äôs Co-Educational College in Hong Kong, and at Lord Byng Secondary School in Vancouver. Li received his BSc. at the University of British Columbia where he studied under Timothy R. Parsons. He received his PhD at Dalhousie University where he studied under Robert O. Fournier and was influenced by Gordon Riley, amongst others. Li undertook postdoctoral training at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences under Ian Morris, and also at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution under Joel C. Goldman.  Research  Li was in the early vanguard of oceanographers who recognized the importance of photosynthetic picoplankton in ocean primary production. He was also one of a small group of ocean-going flow cytometrists who contemporaneously discovered the existence of extremely abundant very small red-autofluorescing cells in the ocean, later shown to be Prochlorococcus. Li affirmed these findings by shipboard flow cytometric sorting of living phytoplankton cells labelled with radioactive carbon as a demonstration that bulk primary production could be recovered by a summation of measured contribution from phytoplankton constituents. Notably, the putative existence of these very small chlorophyll- bearing cells had been predicted by Li's co-author John Cullen in their multi- authored 1983 paper in which the deduction of \\"invisible photoautotrophs\\" was made based on \\"excess chlorophyll\\" as one possibility to reconcile the biomass budget of phytoplankton in the tropical Pacific Ocean Li developed methods and ideas that tried to integrate flow cytometric measurements of ocean microbes within general ecological concepts, eventually into what he called cytometric macroecology. In collaboration with Eddy Carmack, Fiona McLaughlin, Connie Lovejoy, and others, Li showed that this approach was useful in documenting changes in the ecology of plankton microbes in the Arctic Ocean as the waters there warm and freshen In 1992, Li established an oceanographic monitoring station in the Bedford Basin of Halifax Harbour as a sentinel for long-term change in the pelagic environment of coastal waters in Atlantic Canada. The Bedford Basin Monitoring Program was designed to make weekly measurements of selected properties that characterize the physical, chemical, biological and optical environments of the water column. In time, this ocean monitoring site came to be regarded as the inshore terminus (\\"station zero\\") of the Halifax Line of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program, a comprehensive shelf-wide oceanographic monitoring of Atlantic Canada. Using the long-term observations from Bedford Basin as a template, Li and Xos√© Anxelu G. Mor√°n established the Working Group on Phytoplankton and Microbial Ecology of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, one of whose goals was to report on large-scale patterns of phytoplankton change across the North Atlantic Ocean.  Career  As a research scientist for 35 years (1980-2015) in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Li witnessed and engaged in many of the seminal scientific achievements in plankton ecology that took place under the institutional leadership of Alan Longhurst , Kenneth Mann, Michael Sinclair, Trevor Platt, and others. At various points in his career, Li served on the editorial boards of the international journals Limnology and Oceanography, Marine Ecology Progress Series, Aquatic Microbial Ecology, and Journal of Plankton Research. At other various times in his career, Li was appointed as faculty member to the Faculty of 1000, and as adjunct professor at Dalhousie University and Universit√© Laval. In retirement, Li serves as the President of the A.G. Huntsman Foundation, which administers the A.G. Huntsman Award for Excellence in the Marine Sciences. Li also serves on the curriculum committee of the Seniors‚Äô College Association of Nova Scotia.  Awards  In 1986, Li was awarded the APICS-Fraser Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Science and Engineering, Atlantic Provinces Council on the Sciences. The citation for this award noted that \\"Li's work has created an important new body of knowledge on growth measurement and the effects of temperature changes on plankton\\". In 2014, Li and co-authors were awarded the John Martin Award for recognition of a paper in aquatic sciences that is judged to have had a high impact on subsequent research in the field. Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography. The citation for this award noted the following: \\"Described by one nominator as 'a game changer,' the paper firmly established an alternative to food web models based on primary production by net phytoplankton to one in which small photoautotrophs were important\\", and that \\"Confidence in the importance of picophytoplankton engendered by this work led to a pivotal NATO Advanced Study Institute in 1985 (organized by Platt and Li) and triggered widespread interest in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton, a field that has subsequently emerged as a new and vibrant sub-discipline of biological oceanography.\\"  Publications  Publications of Li, W.K.W.

Fielding is a Professor of physical chemistry at University College London (UCL). She focuses on ultrafast transient spectroscopy of protein chromophores and molecules. She was the first woman to win the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize (1996) and Marlow Award (2001).  Education  Fielding studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge. She began her PhD at the University of Cambridge, working with Timothy Softley, but moved with him to the University of Oxford where they studied excited quantum states using photoelectron spectroscopy. She was awarded her Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1992. Career and research Fielding was a scientist at the National Physical Laboratory from 1992 to 1993. In 1993 she joined the University of Amsterdam as a postdoctoral fellow, working with Ben van Linden van den Heuvell. Here she worked on Rydberg wave packets in coulombic and magnetic fields. Fielding was appointed a lecturer at King's College London in 1994 after only 18 months of postdoctoral work. She was the first woman to be awarded the Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize in 1996. She is interested in how to excite electron functions coherently, generating a wave packets with a localised probability distribution. Electron movement occurs on the attosecond timescale, making them impossible to image using conventional laser technology. Instead, Fielding employs femtosecond laser pulses to excite electrons to these highly excited Rydberg states. In these excited states, electrons behave both as a particle and a wave, and can be controlled using its wave-like characteristics. She has become one of few worldwide experts in the field. She is primarily interested in materials such as small organic chromophores and photoactivated peptides. She made the first observation of a wave packet in a Rydberg molecule in 2000. This observation made her interested in coherent control, looking to exploit the phase of a rotating Rydberg molecule to manipulate the dynamics of chemical systems. She explored the decay pathways of the Rydberg molecule NO. Fielding use the wavelength and phase of the laser light to select whether NO decays via ionisation or dissociation. One decay route will be the result of constructive interference and the other the result of destructive interference. This study represented a breakthrough in the field; where light of a precise phase could be used to control molecular dynamics. She became interested in how the optical phase corresponds to the electronic and molecular phase, with a particular focus on the attosecond. Fielding was made an EPSRC advanced research fellow in 2001, and was the first woman to be awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry Marlow Medal. In 2003 Fielding moved to University College London, where she leads a large laser laboratory. Her recent research has focussed on the dynamics of excited states formed during the absorption of ultraviolet light. She has studied the competition between internal conversion and electron detachment in protein chromophores. She has worked extensively on ultrafast chemical biology in the gas phase. Fielding developed time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to study the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited molecules. She has investigated the intramolecular dynamics of vibrationally and electronically excited benzene, and demonstrated new electron transfer pathways in pyrrole dimers.

The lyre was excavated in the Royal Cemetery of Ur during the 1926-27 season of an archeological dig carried out in what is now Iraq jointly by the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum. Leonard Woolley led the excavations. The lyre was found in ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Grave,‚Äù near the bodies of more than sixty soldiers and attendants. It is one of several lyres and harps unearthed at the cemetery which date to the Early Dynastic III Period (2550‚Äì2450 BCE). The lyre was included in the first batch of materials taken to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (the Penn Museum) in 1929. The piece consists of a sound box, a quadripartite panel and a sculpted bull's head. Over the years it has undergone extensive conservation and restoration work.  Composition  The Mesopotamian sun god Utu/Shamash was often taken to assume the form of a bull, particularly in his role at sunrise, and is the figure most frequently described in some cuneiform texts as having a lapis lazuli beard. For these reasons, the Penn Museum has asserted that the bull head of the lyre is a representation of Utu/Shamash. The head was made of a single piece of gold plating over a wooden core (now disintegrated) with gold plated ears and horns attached with small pegs. The beard is made of carved lapis lazuli tesserae on a silver backing. The tips of the bull's horns are also lapis lazuli, making this the only animal-shaped lyre at Ur to have horns tipped in a separate material. The eyes of the bull are shell and lapis lazuli strung with copper wire. In its dimensions, the bull's head is 40 cm long, 25 cm wide, and 19 cm deep. The lyre has a front panel which depicts four scenes linked to Early Mesopotamian funerary rituals. The designs are made of shell inlay on bitumen. The first panel shows a man wrestling two bulls with human heads. The second shows a hyena serving meat and a lion bearing a jar. The third shows an equine animal playing a bull shaped lyre, while a bear supports the lyre, and another animal holds a rattle. The lowest register shows a scorpion man who guards the underworld, greeting a man. In addition to his role as sun god, Utu/Shamash was the judge of the dead. In the lyre, he can be seen as presiding over the events represented in the panel affixed below his head. The lyre's wooden sound box had disintegrated by the time of its excavation, however Woolley's measurements of the box's imprint, as well as casts made from another lyre in the cemetery, have provided the basis for attempts at recreation.  Restoration  The plating of the bull's head had collapsed and torn once the wooden core had deteriorated. The bitumen of the front panel had been pulverized, dislodging the shell inlay. Both were originally restored at the British Museum. When they arrived at the Penn Museum a new sound box was created, and painted by watercolorist Mary Louise Baker. Woolley visited the lyre in 1955, and remarked that the soundbox seemed too large. Measurements of the lyre's imprint taken during the excavation later verified this observation. The museum created a new sound box drawing from these measurements in 1976. The same year, plans to clean and enhance the appearance of the head and plaque lead to the discovery of extensive deterioration. In 1977, James House Jr. began to restore the bull head and the plaque. The head was dismantled and reassembled to expose more of the original work, straighten the ears, and preserve the integrity of the construction. Additional fragments from the field which were originally misattributed, were incorporated into the design and plaster from the initial restoration was removed. Following some experimentation a type of polyethylene glycol wax found to fill the head, which preserves its strength and is removable. These processes, along with X-Rays, have uncovered new information about the head's construction. After the sound box's second reconstruction, the lyre's size increased by about a third suggesting that the lyre must have been steadied by a second person in order for it to be played.

Early life Swakeleys House, Ickenham Vyner was baptized on 31 October 1686, the only son of Thomas Vyner, of Swakeleys, Middlesex and his wife Anne Leeke, daughter of Sir Francis Leeke, 1st Baronet of Newark, Nottinghamshire. He succeeded his father to Swakeleys in 1707 and inherited hisextensive Lincolnshire estates, acquired by his great uncle, Charles II‚Äôs banker. He married Margaret Style, daughter of Sir Thomas Style, 2nd Baronet of Wateringbury, Kent. Career Vyner was elected Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby in a contest at the 1710 general election. His politics were unclear, but the Tory Arthur Moore, who was returned with him he election, wrote that he was sure of his support. Vyner was not an active Member, and little was recorded of him in Parliament. In July 1712 he and Moore presented Grimsby‚Äôs address of thanks for the terms of the peace, on behalf of the High Church party. He did not stand in 1713 and next stood in 1721, when he was defeated at Grimsby. He was returned as an independent Whig MP for Lincolnshire at a by-election on 12 February 1724. He was a highly prolific speaker, and became a voluble opponent of successive administrations, acting consistently against them. He was returned again at the 1727 and 1734 general elections. In February 1741, he voted against the motion for Walpole‚Äôs removal. Church of All Saints, Gautby In 1741, Vyner sold the family mansion at Swakeleys to Benjamin Lethieullier and moved to Gautby Hall in Lincolnshire,. which was probably designed and built for him by Matthew Brettingham.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire p. 247; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram in 1989, Yale University Press. Gautby parish church was rebuilt in 1754 as a family chapel of the Vyner family. It is a Grade II* listed building, red brick, incorporating some medieval work. Vyner installed in the church two reclining statues from St Mary Woolnoth London of Thomas Vyner and Sir Thomas Vyner, 1st Baronet, former lord mayor of London. Vyner was returned unopposed for Lincolnshire again at the 1741 and 1747 general elections. He was described as ‚Äòa whimsical man, full of projects of reformation, especially about the army and militia‚Äô. Horace Walpole remarked of him in 1751 that ‚Äòthe House generally suffered him to be singular in his opinion‚Äô. At the 1754 general election he was again returned unopposed for Lincolnshire. He supported Pitt and his group in opposing the Russian and Hessian subsidy treaties. On 14 June 1758 he and his son were with George Townshend, Edward Montagu, and Thomas Staunton, in a minority of five against an increase of the judges‚Äô salaries and on 26 January 1759 he opposed Pitt‚Äôs motion for a subsidy for the King of Prussia. On 30 October 1760 he let himself be put up against Thomas Whichcot, his fellow Member for 20 years, on a joint interest with Sir John Thorold, but this proved unpopular and he withdrew from the contest at the 1761 general election in around the middle of January 1761. He did not stand again. Later life and legacy Vyner married, as his second wife, Delicia de Pipre of Upper Brook Street, London on 3 June 1758. He died on 10 April 1777 leaving a son and two daughters by his first wife. Gautby Hall was occupied by the Vyner family until 1872 and was destroyed in 1874.

Dowling. The film stars Naomie Harris, Tyrese Gibson, Frank Grillo, Mike Colter, Reid Scott, and Beau Knapp, and follows a rookie police officer who goes on the run after she witnesses a murder. The film had its world premiere at the Urbanworld Film Festival on September 21, 2019 and was released in North America on October 25, 2019, by Screen Gems. Plot U.S. Army veteran Alicia West (Naomie Harris) returns to her hometown in New Orleans where she is recruited into the city's police department. Alicia is reminded by her new partner Kevin Jennings (Reid Scott) about the differences of residing in the community she grew up in and the police department. In order for Jennings to get home to date night with his wife, West takes his place in a double shift with another member of the force, Brown. He gets a call in the middle of their shift and they head over to meet with his CI in an abandoned building where he tells her to wait in the car. Alicia hears gunfire coming from the building where Brown went in and heads over, armed with a Glock pistol and a vest fitted with a body camera. There, Alicia witnesses detective Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) and his men murder an unarmed drug dealer. When Malone attempts to explain away the situation to her, the other, Smitty (Beau Knapp), panics upon seeing Alicia's body cam and shoots at her, causing Alicia to fall through the floor onto the ground below. A wounded Alicia escapes while she is being tracked by Malone and his men. When a fellow police officer arrives, Alicia realizes they are working with Malone, forcing her to hide out in the store of Milo Jackson (Tyrese Gibson), a member of the community who is reluctant to hide her. She tries to get help from her partner, Jennings, but she finds out that he is one of the cohorts and she runs away from him. Meanwhile, Malone blames West for the shooting and manipulates criminal kingpin Darius into putting out an open bounty on West because one of the kids that Malone murdered was Darius' nephew. While recovering in Milo's home, Alicia has a gun pointed at her head by Missy's son. Alicia then learns that Darius put out a bounty on her and that the whole community is tracking her down. Alicia manages to escape, but a wounded Milo is left behind and is captured by Darius. Darius tortures Milo, but Milo refuses to divulge where to find Alicia. Alicia records herself and hides her body cam in an abandoned house. Alicia then exposes herself where Darius does business. She convinces Darius that she has proof that Malone killed Darius' nephew. One of Darius' henchman hacks into Alicia's body cam where the footage is downloaded, and after viewing the footage Darius is convinced that Malone is his nephew's real killer. Malone and his enforcers arrive to track down Alicia; during the ensuing chaos, Darius is killed by Malone, and Brown is killed by Smitty, who is in turn killed by West. West gives the body camera to Milo so that he can sneak into the police station and upload the footage, while she stays and tries to outrun Malone, who is trying to kill her. There is a standoff between Malone and West with the whole black community looking on. When West gets the upper hand, other police officers arrive and tell her to put down the gun. At the same time, the captain gets the footage and radios SRT to get them to stand down and tells them that West is innocent. Malone tries one last time to kill her, pretending she has a gun, but her partner, Jennings, shoots him in the chest and incapacitates him. Malone is arrested and West's name is cleared, earning her the respect of her fellow police officers, as well as the community.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae. Systematics Microcotyle otrynteri was first described by Pearse in 1949 based on 4 specimens taken from one host. According to Hendrix (1994), the species is poorly described and needs further investigation. Hendrix, S. S. (1994). Marine flora and fauna of the eastern United States. Platyhelminthes: Monogenea (NOAA Technical Report NMFS 121). Seattle: US Department of Commerce. PDF Morphology Microcotyle otrynteri has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a slender body, widest in the middle and tapering toward each end, with an expanded anterior end. The body comprises an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor bears 40 clamps, arranged as two closely set rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two buccal suckers anterior to the pharynx at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a pharynx, and a posterior intestine with two lateral branches. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an genital atrium, armed with numerous conical spines, a single ovary, vitellarium glands and testes which are posterior to the ovary. Etymology The specific name otrynteri is derived from the generic name of the host species Otrynter caprinus. Diagnosis According to Pearse (1949), Microcotyle otrynteri can be differentiated from other species of the genus Microcotyle studies by him in the same paper, by the dorsal papilla over the mouth, and the number and character of the haptoral clamps. Hosts, localities The type-host of Microcotyle peprili is Otrynter caprinus The type-host and only recorded host of Microcotyle otrynteri is Otrynter caprinus (Sparidae ).

Spending most of the first stages of his career in team action, he collected the WWL World Trios Championship. In 2019, Electro became winner of the IWA World Heavyweight Championship. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2014‚Äì2016)= When interviewed, Montalvo expressed that he was widely underestimated early in his career, noting that even his teacher was skeptical of his potential. In January 2014, he began his career by performing as \\"Electro Boy\\" in the independent circuit, appearing in regional promotions like Caribbean Wrestling Federation, 100% Lucha and WPV, among others. Montalvo joined the World Wrestling League in 2016, where he began performing and later became simply known as \\"Electro\\" in the undercard while being evaluated. During this time he continued appearing at 100% Lucha, joining V√≠ctor Mel√©ndez against Black Money Services, and Noche de Evoluci√≥n 4. At WWL, Electro was randomly attacked by the Westside Mafia as they threatened Savio Vega with revealing the contents of a mysterious black box. Electro then unsuccessfully challenged 5to Elemento for the WWL Super Cruiserweight Championship. During this time, Manny Ferno began approaching him to join a nascent stable called Puro Macho. Electro continued pursuing titles, joining Jayden and Sr. C in an unsuccessful challenge for the WWL World Trios Championship. =Puro Macho, main event push (2017‚Äì2018)= As part of Puro Macho, Electro faced off in a series against La Hermandad. Afterwards, he joined Khriz \\"The Chosen\\" and JC Navarro in a win over the Westside Mafia. Afterwards, Electro and Khriz failed to win the WWL World Tag Team Championship in a rematch that also included La Hermandad and Los Primos Rodr√≠guez.

Electro then joined Khriz and David Montes in defeating Los Favoritos and winning the WWL World Trios Championship. At Juicio Final, Savio Vega made his return to WWL with a team of former IWA wrestlers and challenged Manny Ferno for control. Electro joined Puro Macho in defeating Team Savio/IWA at Golpe de Estado, in the process stopping an attempt to rename the promotion. Electro and Khriz then attempted to become dual champions by going after the tag team champions in a three-way match, but were uninvolved in the outcome. In another encounter between Puro Macho and Team Savio/IWA, he was hit with an object and pinned. After Vega left WWL, Electro faced a remnant of the invading team in Noel Rodr√≠guez (initially supposed to be Jes√∫s Castillo Jr.) as part of a series of hardcore matches. Electro joined Puro Macho when the group made a surprise appearance at Hugo Savinovich's MysterioMan√≠a: Tributo al Mes√≠as where IWA-PR officially announced its return to the wrestling scene. This new confrontation with Savio Vega marked the beginning of a transition for the stable, which nonetheless decided to close up their storylines at WWL by appearing in the season closing event.

Electro revealed his interest to Khriz \\"The Chosen\\", while Mr. Big did the same on his part. Caught in an unsalvageable situation, Ferno declined to name a contender, allowing Director of Talent Relations Dennis Rivera to choose Electro in his stead (hoping that this would breach the team's chemistry). Ultimately, Mr. Big was also allowed to participate after Shane Sewell surrendered his spot. To open Impacto Total: El Tour he joined Puro Macho in giving Team IWA a beat down.

Volume 12, pp. 263-295 + Plates (foldout) Whole volume, PDF in BHL Systematics Microcotyle hiatulae was described by Goto in 1899 from the gills of the labrid Hiatula onitis collected near Newport, off Rhode Island, United States. Forty-one years later, Linton (1940) described M. furcata from the gills the same host collected near Woods Hole, off Massachusetts. As Linton did not mention M. hiatulae in his description of M. furcata, Thoney & Munroe suggested that Linton was unaware of Goto's earlier description of M. hiatulae.Thoney, D. A., & Munroe, T. A. (1987). Microcotyle hiatulae Goto, 1900 (Monogenea), a senior synonym of M. furcata Linton, 1940, with a redescription and comments on postlarval development. Proceedings of the Helminthological Society of Washington, 54(1), 91-95. Thoney & Munroe examined Microcotyle specimens from T. onitis off Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Chesapeake Bay and indicated that all specimens collected from all three locations were indistinguishable from M. hiatulae. They concluded that Microcotyle furcata should be considered a junior subjective synonym of M. hiatulae'. Thoney & Munroe provided a redescription and illustrations of Microcotyle hiatulae to complete the original description lacking data on intraspecific variation and some important taxonomic characters, and also described the postlarval development. Thoney and Munroe's comparison of M. hiatulae with 18 other species of Microcotyle described previously from 15 host species living sympatrically with Hiatula onitis along the Atlantic coast of the United States by examination of published descriptions showed that many of the species were morphologically similar. Thoney and Munroe also noted that it was extremely difficult to identify an individual to species level in absence of host species identification. Unnithan erected the subgenus Microcotyle in which he placed Microcotyle hiatulae as Microcotyle (Microcotyle) hiatulae.Unnithan, R. V. (1971). On the functional morphology of a new fauna of Monogenoidea on fishes from Trivandrum and environs. Part IV. Microcotylidae sensu stricto and its repartition into subsidiary taxa. American Midland Naturalist, 366-398.'' Description Microcotyle hiatulae has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a symmetrical body, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor bears 23 clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two small buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a pharynx, an oesophagus and a posterior intestine with two branches of un equal lengths, provided with numerous bifurcating branches on the inner and outer sides and one of them extends much more backwards into the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium provided with numerous conical slightly recurved spines and opening a short distance in front of the hind end of the oesophagus, a dorsal vagina opening behind the front end of the intestine, a single ovary \\"somewhat like a hastily written capital E\\", vitellaria extending from near the hind end of the oesophagus to the hind end of the body and 15 large testes which are posterior to the ovary and extends from the hind end of the ovary to a little in front of the posterior end of the vitellaria. Hosts and localities Tautoga onitis is the type host of Microcotyle hiatulae The type-host in the original publication is Hiatula Onitis (Labridae) (currently Tautoga onitis). The type-locality is off Rhode Island, United States. Treatment Thoney and Hargis found that formalin (250 ppm, 1 h) was ineffective against Microcotyle hiatulae on the gills of Tautoga onitis.

He was one of the pioneer nationalists from the Northern region of Nigeria.  Life  Abdallah was Ebira and was born in Okene in 1920. His father worked with the colonial authorities as a messenger but later became a judge of the Ebira Native Authority. Abdallah had the privilege of starting primary school within the palace of Attah Ibrahim. He then attended Bida Middle School and Katsina Training College. In 1936, he began work as an announcer for the Post and Telegraphs department in Lagos, when rediffusion radio service began in Lagos, Abdallah transferred his services to the new department As a radio announcer in Lagos, he became familiar with the nationalist writings of Nnamdi Azikiwe who had just begun publishing his West African Pilot. In 1940, he was transferred to Kano to work at the Northern region radio rediffusion broadcasting service. His familiarity with Azikiwe's writings especially on discrimination emboldened him to create discussions about nationalism in the North, in addition, he joined a few socio-political organizations in the North of like minded individuals such as Osita Agwuna. In 1946, he co-founded the Northern Elements Progressive Association, an organization with close links to NCNC and he also organized the Kano branch of Zikist Movement, later becoming the association's president. Through NEPA, he sought to raise consciousness about nationalism through public lectures and letters to prominent traditional authorities. Abdallah's role in the Zikist Movement was critical in keeping the group together for a while as ethnic sentiments created division among members. But a speech by Abdallah then newly appointed president of the movement entitled What is Zikism, emphasizing the group's belief in freedom from domination and equality became known to his supervisor who issued him a query for engaging in politics. Abdallah was later dismissed from his position as wireless coordinator and announcer at Kano Rediffusion Service when his membership of NEPA and Zikist Movement was deemed to be in violation of the code of conduct of civil servants and his defiant response to the query was unsatisfactory to his supervisor. Upon his departure from colonial service, Abdallah became more active in the Zikist Movement, organizing public lectures and debates about colonialism. He was tried and convicted for sedition in 1949. Upon his release, he joined NCNC but later left the party in 1955. From 1955 to 1966, he was aligned with the Northern People's Congress working at the party's secretariat as party manager.

Assessment and treatment may include the following areas: psychosocial, cognitive, behavioral, and functional status, self-esteem, coping skills, and quality of life. As the conditions experienced by patients vary widely, rehabilitation psychologists offer individualized treatment approaches. The discipline takes a holistic approach, considering individuals within their broader social context and assessing environmental and demographic factors that may enhance or impede progress. In addition to clinical practice, rehabilitation psychologists engage in consultation, program development, teaching, training, public policy, and advocacy. Aspects of Rehabilitation Psychology overlap with the specialties of clinical neuropsychology, counseling psychology, and health psychology; however, Rehabilitation Psychology is distinctive in its focus on working with individuals with all types of disability and chronic health conditions maintain/gain and advance in vocation; in the context of interdisciplinary health care teams; and as social change agents to improve societal attitudes toward individuals living with disabilities and chronic health conditions.Elliott, T. R., & Rath, J. F. (2011). Rehabilitation psychology. In E. M. Altmaier & J-I. C. Hansen (Eds.), Oxford handbook of counseling psychology (pp. 679-702). New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Rehabilitation psychologists work as advocates with persons with disabilities to eliminate attitudinal, policy, and physical barriers, and to emphasize employment, environmental access, and social role and community integration. Rehabilitation psychologists provide clinical services in varied healthcare settings, including acute care hospitals, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation centers, assisted living centers, long-term care facilities, specialty clinics, and community agencies. They typically work in interdisciplinary teams, often including a physiatrist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist.Rath, J. F., & Langer, K. G. (2019). Consultation. In L. A. Brenner, S. A. Reid-Arndt, T. R. Elliott, R. G. Frank, & B. Caplan (Eds.), Handbook of rehabilitation psychology (3rd ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. A nurse, social worker, prosthetist, chaplain, and case manager also may be included depending on individual needs. Members of the team work together to create a treatment plan, set goals, educate both the patient and their support network, and facilitate discharge planning. In the United States, the specialty of Rehabilitation Psychology is overseen by the Rehabilitation Psychology Specialty Council (RPSC), which comprises five professional organizations that represent the major constituencies in Rehabilitation Psychology: Division 22 of the American Psychological Association, the American Board of Rehabilitation Psychology (ABRP), the Foundation for Rehabilitation Psychology (FRP), the Council of Rehabilitation Psychology Postdoctoral Training Programs (CRPPTP), and the Academy of Rehabilitation Psychology (ARP). RPSC represents the specialty to the Council of Specialties in Professional Psychology(CoS). Rehabilitation Psychology is its official journal. Rehabilitation Psychology is certified as one of 14 specialty competencies by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP). History The specialty of rehabilitation psychology was established well before psychologists were regularly involved in healthcare settings. In the 1940s and 1950s, psychologists became increasingly involved in caring for persons with disabilities, often the result of combat injuries. Advances in technology had led to an increased number of people surviving injuries and illnesses that would have been fatal in previous generations. Individuals living with disabilities and chronic health conditions needed help to adjust, and rehabilitation psychology emerged to meet these needs using psychological knowledge to help maximize independence, health, and welfare. In 1954, the Vocational Rehabilitation Act was passed, providing grant funding for research and program development. As a result of this act, many universities opened vocational rehabilitation counseling programs within their graduate schools. In 1958, Rehabilitation Psychology was established as Division 22 of the American Psychological Association, as an organization of psychologists concerned with the psychological and social consequences of disability, and with the development of ways to prevent and resolve problems associated with disability. By the 1960s, rehabilitation psychology was considered a mature specialty and was prominent throughout the United States. However, it was not until 1997 that the American Board of Professional Psychology approved the establishment of the American Board of Rehabilitation Psychology. Key principles and models Theoretical models are important in rehabilitation psychology for understanding and explaining impairments, aiding treatment planning, and facilitating the prediction of outcomes. Models help organize, understand, explain, and predict phenomena.Reel, K., & Feaver, S. (2006). Models: Terminology and usefulness. In S. Davis (Ed.), Rehabilitation: The use of theories and models in practice (pp. 49‚Äì62). New York: Elsevier. The models used integrate information from a number of disciplines, such as biology, psychology, and sociology. A wide array of models is needed because of the diverse problems and concerns faced by individuals with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Often, more than one model must be applied to properly understand an individual's condition. Biopsychosocial model: The biopsychosocial model examines the interaction of medical conditions, psychological stressors, the environment, and personal factors to understand an individual's adaptation to disability. This interdisciplinary model is an acknowledgement that disability only can be understood within a larger context, and reflects the longstanding belief of rehabilitation psychologists that cultural attitudes and environmental barriers influence an individual's adaptation and accentuate disability.Wendell, S. (1996). The social construction of disability. The Rejected Body (pp. 54-89). New York, NY: Routledge. Notably, the tenets of this model are reflected in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The framework is holistic and to apply it providers must learn about the disabled person's home life and broader social context. Psychoanalytic model: In the context of rehabilitation psychology, Freud's concept of castration anxiety can be applied to severe losses, such as the loss of a limb. This concept is reflected in Jerome Siller's stage theory of adjustment, designed to increase understanding of acceptance and adjustment following sudden disability. Social psychology: The pioneers in rehabilitation psychology were a diverse group, but many came from the field of social psychology. Kurt Lewin is one example. As a Jew living in Germany during the early years of the Nazi regime, Lewin's experiences shaped his psychological work. This is reflected in his conceptualization of the insider-outsider distinction, as well as his understanding of stigma. Lewin is known for his conceptualization B = f(p,e), where behavior (B) is a function of both the person (p) and their environment (e). Tamara Dembo and Beatrice Wright, two of Lewin's students, are recognized as pioneering figures in the history of rehabilitation psychology. Wright authored two of the field's seminal texts, Physical Disability: A Psychological Approach and the extensively revised second edition, Physical Disability: A Psychosocial Approach. She also proposed the somatopsychological model, which advocates for interpreting disability within its social context. The somatopsychological model is derived from Lewin's field theory and holds that the environment can either aid or hinder an individual's adjustment. Wright's insights and her articulation of the beliefs and principles underlying rehabilitation psychology practice have come to be known as the \\"foundational principles of rehabilitation psychology\\" and her work continues to inform contemporary rehabilitation psychology research, theory, and practice. Cognitive-Behavior Theory: Cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches such as problem-solving treatment have shown promise in promoting adjustment, well-being, and overall health among individuals with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This model holds that thoughts and coping strategies directly impact feelings and behaviors. By emphasizing, identifying, and changing maladaptive thoughts, CBT works to change an individual's subjective experience and their resulting behavior. A variety of empirical studies have demonstrated CBT's effectiveness in cases of traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and a variety of other conditions common to individuals living with disability and chronic health conditions. Clinical specialty areas In clinical settings, rehabilitation psychologists apply psychological expertise and skills to improve outcomes for individuals living with disabilities or chronic health conditions. Common populations treated include individuals with: * AIDS * Acquired brain injury * Cancer * Chronic pain * Concussion * Limb loss * Multiple sclerosis * Neuromuscular disorders * Spinal cord injury * Stroke * Traumatic brain injury When addressing these chronic health conditions and disabilities, rehabilitation psychologists offer a variety of services with the goal of increasing an individual's functioning and quality of life. Specific services may include: =Assessment= To enhance the rehabilitation process, one must not only identify barriers to recovery, but also personal strengths and resiliency factors that foster continued recovery and social reintegration. Rehabilitation psychology's focus on personal strengths and resiliency has been influential in the field of positive psychology. Rehabilitation psychologists take into consideration the medical diagnosis, referral question, background history, pre-morbid functioning (independence with basic and instrumental activities of daily living), current functioning (physical, cognitive, psychological), personality characteristics, and goals (career, academic, personal). Depending upon the referral question and individual patient goals, a structured and focused assessment may include any combination of the following components: cognitive function (decisional capacity, mental status, neurocognitive function); physical function (fatigue, health behavior, pain, sleep); psychological function (emotional adjustment, interpersonal/social functioning, personality, mental health conditions). Aspects of the individual's environment also are assessed, including cultural, community, home, rehabilitation, school, vocational, and social environments. In addition to clinical assessment and interview, standardized measures can be helpful for understanding each of these component areas in greater detail. =Cognitive rehabilitation= Cognitive rehabilitation refers to the broad range of evidence-based interventions designed to improve cognitive functioning impaired as a result of changes in the brain due to injury or illness. Because of their specialized training in the nuances of impaired cognitive abilities, within the context of personality and emotional factors, rehabilitation psychologists are uniquely qualified to provide interventions for cognitive and psychosocial difficulties following brain injury. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been used with people who have sustained brain injury, stroke, brain tumor, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment, ADHD, and a variety of other medical conditions that affect cognitive functioning. Cognitive functions targeted may include processing speed, attention, memory, language, visual-perceptual skills, and executive functioning skills such as problem solving and emotional self- regulation. Cognitive rehabilitation can include computer-based tasks, but such tasks are most effective when administered under the guidance of a trained clinician in an individualized setting. Contemporary rehabilitation psychology approaches to cognitive rehabilitation incorporate the subjective experience of the patient while targeting meta-cognition or self regulation. The ultimate goal of all cognitive rehabilitation interventions is to improve the everyday functioning of people in the setting in which they live or work. Ethical and legal considerations Rehabilitation psychologists adhere to the same general principles and ethical codes of conduct as all psychologists, under guidelines set forth by the American Psychological Association (http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/). Rehabilitation psychologists also must follow federal laws relevant to individuals with disability. Rehabilitation psychologists often are faced with ethical and legal considerations when assisting patients with concerns such as end-of-life decision making, ability to return to driving (e.g., following acquired brain injury, stroke, or other medical conditions that may impair driving ability), and the role of faith/religion in the individual's health-care decision making. Relevant federal legislation includes: * Rehabilitation Act of 1973: This Act prohibits discrimination of persons based on disability status in programs conducted by Federal agencies, those receiving Federal financial assistance, in Federal employment, and in the employment practices of Federal contractors. * Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): This Act was an extension of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The ADA's five titles prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in employment, government, public and commercial facilities, transportation, and telecommunications. * Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): This Act was initiated in 1996 in an effort to protect the privacy of patient information. It affects rehabilitation psychologists in a variety of important ways and occasionally contradicts aspects of the APA Ethical Code. For example, under the Act, tests designed to measure psychological and neurocognitive function may not be released to the general public. Instead of releasing the tests themselves, rehabilitation psychologists typically provide summaries of the data, interpretation, and treatment recommendations. Education and training In the United States, rehabilitation psychologists complete doctoral degrees (e.g., PhD or PsyD)Rath, J. F., Bertisch, H., & Elliott, T. R. (2017). Psychologists specializing in rehabilitation psychology. In R. Sternberg (Ed.), Career paths in psychology: Where your degree can take you (3rd ed, pp. 227-243). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. in fields such as clinical psychology, counseling psychology, neuropsychology, or school psychology, plus pre-doctoral and post-doctoral clinical training in healthcare settings. Rehabilitation psychologists must be licensed in order to provide services in their state of practice and to receive reimbursement from health insurance payers. In most states, obtaining a license requires a doctoral degree from an approved program, a minimum number of hours of supervised clinical experience, and a passing score on the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP), a standardized knowledge-based examination. Most states also require a prescribed number of continuing education credits per year to renew a license. By the 1960s, the need for standardized guidelines for postdoctoral training in rehabilitation psychology was recognized during the speciality's national conferences. The APA Division of Rehabilitation Psychology (Division 22) and the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine spent four years developing guidelines leading up to the 1992 Ann Arbor Conference in Postdoctoral Training in Professional Psychology. Patterson and Hanson outlined the entrance requirements, training length, curriculum requirements, supervision, and evaluations: * Trainees are accepted only from programs approved by the American Psychological Association. * Minimum length of training is one year * There are a minimum of two supervisors during training * Curriculum includes supervised practice, seminars, and coursework * Patient populations and didactics are related to disabilities and chronic health conditions * There is a minimum of two hours of supervision per week * All trainees are funded * There are written objectives for the training program * Formal trainee evaluations occur at least twice a year * Program evaluations occur annually In 1997, the American Board of Professional Psychology approved the establishment of the American Board of Rehabilitation Psychology. Subsequently, the board elaborated on the guidelines from 1995 by requiring a board certification that assesses an individual on the expected competencies. Expected competencies were the capability to assess and treat disability adjustment, cognitive functioning, personality functioning, family functioning, social environment, social functioning, educational functioning, vocational functioning, recreational functioning, sexual functioning, substance abuse, and pain. In addition to displaying these competencies, rehabilitation psychologists are expected to collaborate and consult with other rehabilitation professionals within the interdisciplinary team throughout the treatment process. The ABRP Board Certification process recognizes, certifies, and promotes competence in the specialty. The American Board of Professional Psychology specifies that in order to meet the standards of the speciality, an individual must complete a recognized internship program, have three years of experience within the field, and have supervised experience within the specialty.

She continued to show during the remainder of career, but notices of exhibitions were much less common in those years. Cawein's early work earned awards. Her 1934 etching \\"South Window\\" (shown at left) appeared in a juried show called the International Exhibition of Contemporary Prints, held at the Art Institute of Chicago in conjunction with the Chicago World's Fair. In 1936 her drypoint, \\"Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, in 1869\\" (shown at right) won the Frederick Talcott Prize, an award given annually by the Society of American Etchers for the best print by a non-member to be shown at its annual exhibition. In 1944 her drypoint sketch, \\"Uncle Clarence's Barn, Fairfield, N.Y.\\" received honorable mention in the annual exhibition put on by the National Association of Women Artists. In 1947 an etching of Cawein's won an award at the 55th Annual Exhibition of the National Association of Women Artists. Cawein seems not to have sold her prints through commercial dealers, instead taking advantage of shows held by non-profit organizations where works on display were offered for sale. Over the years, she became a member of quite a few associations that served this purpose. Her memberships included the Society of American Etchers, National Association of Woman Artists, Chicago Society of Etchers, Philadelphia Society of Etchers, Society of Graphic Artists, and Art Students League. Although primarily known for her etchings, Cawein also worked in other print media including drypoint, aquatint and woodcut and also made drawings and pastels. Her subjects were mainly landscapes and interiors, only occasionally including figures. Critics considered her prints to be \\"striking\\" and having a \\"high level of workmanship.\\" Her etching \\"Gurgling Rillo\\" (shown at left) was said to employ light and shadow in a manner that \\"surpasses photographic technic and tells a story.\\" Personal life Kathrin Cawein, Pleasantville, etching, about 1935, 8 1/2 x 6 1/4 inches Cawein's father was Henry Cawein, born May 1857 in Pfalz, Bavaria. Her mother was Barbara Franz Cawein, born July 1857 in the same place. They were married on November 14, 1878 in a Protestant ceremony in a Bavarian church. Henry Cawein died soon after the couple emigrated to New York City in about 1879. Cawein had a brother John A. Cawein (also known as Albert), born September 14, 1880 in Manhattan, died November 20, 1956, and a sister, Olga E. Cawein, born February 1890 in New London, Connecticut. Olga married Henry W. (Harry) Flechsenhaar on May 12, 1917. During the years from 1911 to 1920 Cawein and her sister lived with their widowed mother in the Bronx and worked as piano roll editors. In 1920 Cawein and her mother moved from the Bronx to live with Olga, and Olga's husband in a house on Bear Ridge Road in Pleasantville, New York. In 1930, then studying at the Art Students League, Cawein lived with her mother in a house by the train station near the center of the village of Pleasantville. After this move, she made etchings of Pleasantville scenes, including the one shown at right. At about this time, Cawein became the prot√©g√© of a wealthy Pleasantville couple, Seabury C. Mastick and his wife Agnes Warner Mastick and in 1932 the Masticks hosted a reception for her and another Pleasantville artist to open an exhibition of their work that was held in the parish house of a local church. In 1946 Cawein moved again, this time to a studio and residence on Mountain Road in Pleasantville. In 1956 and again in 1960 she traveled to Europe with the Masticks, as their assistant and traveling companion. In 1964, a year after Agnes Mastick's death, she and Seabury Mastick married. Although Cawein had no direct connection with Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, she became a benefactor of the school after receiving her inheritance from the Mastick estate. Her donations included a contribution to the endowment fund from the sale of the Mastick home in Pleasantville, the establishment of a scholarship fund, and both ownership of her etching plates and the receipts from sale of prints made from them. In 1984 the university honored Cawein by establishing the Kathrin Cawein Gallery of Art, funded by matching grant funds from the Oregon Arts Commission. Other names: Cawein's given name was often misspelled in the press. Both Katherine and Kathryn were common.

It is located at a distance of circa 45 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3511 is about 70,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 21, 1786. It lies two degrees west of Beta Crateris. NGC 3511 features two very diffuse, thick, and patchy spiral arms that emanate from the bulge, while there are also other spiral arm fragments. Dark dust lanes can be seen across the spiral pattern. The bulge appears elliptical and is weak. The galaxy is seen at a high inclination, estimated to be 70¬∞. In the centre of the galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, whose mass is estimated to be 106.46 ¬± 0.33 (1.3 - 6.2 million) , based on the pitch angle of the spiral arms. The galaxy had been classified as a type 1 Seyfert galaxy, however it features only narrow emission lines, and has been reclassified as a HII region galaxy. The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope has detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission.

It is best known for developing corporate travel management and expense software for web browsers, the App Store and Google Play. The company was founded in 2015 by former Kayak.com executives, Paul M. English and Bill O'Donnell. The website operates under a travel agency model for hotel and flight search information as well as booking services for businesses. It also has administrative analytics on employee travel and associated costs. Lola has received more than $80 million in funding since its foundation. History In July 2015, Blade, a Boston-based incubator, began focusing on a single startup. By December, English announced that Lola had emerged from stealth mode. The company's name was derived from a combination of the words \\"latitude\\" and \\"longitude\\". It acquired HopOn, a travel booking company, in 2015 and Room77, a hotel metasearch website, in 2016. The company launched an iOS application in April 2016 where users chatted with human travel agents. That same month, it completed a $20 million Series A funding round led by General Catalyst and Accel. The company had more than $44 million in total funding after a December 2016 Series B round led by Charles River Ventures. GV and Tenaya Capital each invested $5 million in the round, while previous investors General Catalyst and Accel also participated. In July 2017, Lola had its second major release on iOS and the Android operating system. This iteration of the application focused on business travel by adding self-service hotel and flight booking and personalized travel recommendations. In July 2018, English announced he would assume the role of chief technology officer at Lola, with Mike Volpe, the chief marketing officer at Cybereason, becoming the company's chief executive officer.

Based on his patronymic, N√∫√±ez, meaning son of Nu√±o, he was probably a son of Nu√±o Fern√°ndez, who is known to have been Count of Burgos in 921 and Count of Castile in 927. At the time these were distinct counties, although sometimes held simultaneously by the same individual. Nu√±o is not recorded after 927 and Fernando Ans√∫rez had replaced him in Castile by 929. Probably Nu√±o had died and the counties had been separated again, Gutier succeeding him Burgos and Castile being granted to Fernando Ans√∫rez. Gutier appears in a document from the monastery of San Pedro de Carde√±a dated 1 March 931. The document is dated when \\"King Alfonso [was ruling] in Le√≥n and Count Gutier in Burgos\\". The king in question was Alfonso IV of Le√≥n. The historians Justiniano Rodr√≠guez Fern√°ndez and Justo P√©rez de Urbel argue that the count of Burgos was not the son of Nu√±o Fern√°ndez but is rather to be identified with a Galician count named Gutier (or Gutierre) Mu√±oz. He was a grandson of Count Gutier Men√©ndez, a nephew of Saint Rudesind and a sister of Gotona, wife of King Sancho Ord√≥√±ez. P√©rez de Urbel points out that the name Gutier is not known to have been used in Castile before the appearance of Gutier at Burgos in 931. The appointment of a Galician from the far west of the kingdom to comital office in Castile in the far east, however, would have been a highly unusual exercise of authority by Alfonso IV. Since Alfonso IV was deposed within months, it is not surprising that Gutier does not reappear as count in the east after 931. This identification of Gutier N√∫√±ez with the Galician count is difficult to accept on two grounds. First, the patronymics N√∫√±ez and Mu√±oz refer to two distinct names, Nu√±o and Munio, although they have often been confused and it is possible that the copyist of the Carde√±a charter simply recorded the name incorrectly. Second, the Galician count died around 999, which makes him improbably (but not impossibly) old at the time of his death, since he would have already been an adult when he was count 68‚Äì72 years before his death.

The park is next to the Southampton and New Forest Magistrates court building. The park was originally constructed in the 19th century as a pleasure garden for the residents of a nearby housing development. In 1879 it was donated by Mrs Jane Wills, Miss Margaret Toomer and Miss Rebecca Toomer (the heirs of Edward Toomer who had constructed the housing development) to Southampton council on condition that it remain a park forever. During World War Two air raid shelters for ordnance survey staff were constructed in the park. After the war the park seems to have been largely abandoned before being converted into a car park in 1967. In the early 1980s the city of Southampton society and the Southampton Commons and Parks Protection Society became aware of the then car park‚Äôs status and the terms of the initial gift (at least in the case of the Southampton Commons and Parks Protection Society via an anonymous letter). Attempts to raise the matter with the council resulted in no action and an appeal to the Local Government Ombudsman was rejected on the basis of the car park having being constructed before the Ombudsman came into existence and the council not having been given enough time to put things right. A second appeal to the Ombudsman in 1988 was accepted and the car park closed in 1990.

This group is more inquisitive than assertive -- whether playing one of Gustavsen's seven originals, traditional songs, or the three adaptations of J.S. Bach compositions ... The Other Side offers an expanded version of Gustavsen's trio signature. It retains the elemental articulations of melodic focus that made the previous version unique, but asks far more questions of the material needing to deliver answers, creating a constantly evolving, affirmative body of music\\". On PopMatters, John Garratt noted \\"There's plenty to like in The Other Side 's loose feel in how composition swirls with improvisation. It's also too easy to let it pass you by ... Even when his playing is at its most rapid, Tord Gustavsen still applies a minimal approach that is frightened to wake the baby\\".Garratt, J. PopMatters Review, January 18, 2019 The All About Jazz review by Mike Jurkovic said that \\"All his compositions on The Other Side bare their secrets slowly and play out their methodically expressionistic hauntings with a gospel-influenced left hand seemingly rooted thousands of miles away in the muddy Louisiana delta ... The Other Side is a warm, whole- cloth adventure of spacious interiors ... Gustavsen freely mixes the ancient music of Norway with his love of Bach, the pianist arranging three chorales for the album; amongst them, the Vespestad-led \\"Schlafes Bruder\\" integrates a deep groove that Bach may never have imagined\\".Jurkovic, M.

It begins in Mesaieed in Al Wakrah Municipality and extends north towards Ras Laffan on the coast in Al Khor Municipality. Constructed by Ashghal (the Public Works Authority), the road features 7 lanes in both directions which altogether can accommodate roughly 16,000 vehicles an hour. There are 21 main interchanges, linking the highway with other important roads such as G-Ring Road, Salwa Road, Dukhan Highway and Al Shamal Road. Ashghal claims that the road reduces travel times by up to 50% from its beginning to end when compared to the alternative route running through Doha proper. The highway opened on an official level in February 2019; its opening marked a name change from the Orbital Highway to Al Majd Road. Description Al Majd Road was designed to reduce traffic congestion in Doha by providing an alternative north-to-south route which strategically runs through most of Qatar's largest industrial and residential centers located outside Doha. The beginning and end points, Mesaieed and Ras Laffan, are both major industrial cities which generate heavy loads of traffic. Not far north of Mesaieed is Qatar's main commercial seaport Hamad Port, which directly connects with Qatar's most populated industrial area, the Doha Industrial Area exclave surrounded by Al Rayyan and Al Wakrah Municipality. Another industrial center which is indirectly served by the Al Majd Road is the western city of Dukhan, which connects at the Dukhan Highway‚ÄìAl Majd Road junction. Development Construction of Al Majd Road first began in early 2014 under the name Orbital Highway. By July 2017 Ashghal announced that almost 125 km, or two-thirds of the highway had been constructed, marking the completion of phase one of development and its unofficial opening for traffic. The highway was officially completed and unveiled to the public in February 2019. Upon its unveiling, its name was changed from Orbital Highway to Al Majd Road, to reflect the popular cultural icon of Tamim Almajd, which was created during the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Major junctions *Al Majd Road‚ÄìG-Ring Road junction is at Bu Jood Interchange. G-Ring Road is a highway running from Hamad International Airport to Al Majd Road. This junction provides an alternate route for residents of southern Doha and northern Al Wakrah who wish to travel to Lusail or Al Khor in the north or Dukhan in the west. Furthermore, new arrivals at the airport can bypass downtown Doha by arriving at this junction. *Al Majd Road‚ÄìSalwa Road junction is at Mesaieed Interchange, also known as Interchange 24. This junction allows residents of Al Rayyan City and the Doha Industrial Area to travel north towards Al Khor or south towards Mesaieed without crossing into Doha. *Al Majd Road‚ÄìDukhan Highway junction is a crucial junction for traffic from Dukhan, Al Shahaniya and Rawdat Rashed which is headed towards Al Khor, Lusail, Mesaieed and Hamad International Airport. *Al Majd Road‚ÄìAl Shamal Road junctions are at Al Mazruah Interchange and Umm Asmira Interchange. This junction allows commuters from Al Khor travelling on Al Shamal Road easy access to Dukhan Highway via Al Majd Road. It also permits residents of Umm Salal Municipality to access Dukhan Highway without having to navigate the traffic of Doha proper.

Northern Song =Taizu (r. 960‚Äì975)= Song dynasty's conquest of China Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960-975), Zhao Kuangyin, was commander-in-chief of the capital guards and jiedushi of Songzhou in the Later Zhou dynasty. In 960 he was dispatched by the Grand Chancellor Fan Zhi to fight against Northern Han and the Khitans. When Zhao's army reached Chenqiao Station, his soldiers proclaimed him emperor, and the administration of Kaifeng accepted his authority. Resistance from the provincial commanders Li Yun and Li Chongjin were suppressed by Zhao's generals Murong Yanzhao and Han Lingkun. Afterwards, Zhao took over the imperial guard and dismissed all his generals with honors, gaining complete control over the former territory of Later Zhou.http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song-event.html Emperor Taizu then set about conquering the various states of the Ten Kingdoms. Jingnan fell in 963, Meng Chang surrendered Later Shu in 965, Liu Chang surrendered Southern Han in 970, and Southern Tang fell in 975. Campaigns against Northern Han were launched in 968 and 969, but Song forces were unable to breach the fortifications of Taiyuan. In 969, gunpowder propelled fire arrows, rocket arrows, were invented by Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng. In 975, the state of Wuyue sent a group of soldiers skilled in the use of fire arrows to the Song dynasty, which used fire arrows and incendiary bombs in the same year to destroy the fleet of Southern Tang. Taizu did not live to see China unified. He died in 976 and was succeeded by his younger brother Zhao Guangyi, posthumously Emperor Taizong of Song. =Taizong (r. 976‚Äì997)= Emperor Taizong of Song, Zhao Guangyi, finished the conquest of the remaining Ten Kingdoms. Qian Chu surrendered Wuyue in 978 and in 979, four Song armies under Pan Mei and Guo Jin marched on the capital of Northern Han, Taiyuan. The Khitans sent a relief force but were annihilated. So fell Northern Han. In the southwest, the Song and their aboriginal allies in Guizhou attacked the Mu'ege Kingdom in 976, forcing them to retreat to Dafang County. In 979, Taizong personally led an invasion of the Khitan Liao dynasty to retake the Sixteen Prefectures. He laid siege to Youzhou but was defeated by Khitan reinforcements led by Yel√º Xiuge at the Battle of Gaoliang River. In 980, Yang Ye and his son Yanlang (Yang Yanzhao) defeated a major Liao invasion, consisted of 100,000 troops, at the Yanmen Pass region. In 982, he scored yet again another victory; this time counterattacked Liao well into their controlled areas of the Shanxi region. In 981, the Song invaded kingdom of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát with initial success but was ambushed and the campaign ended with L√™ Ho√†n accepting Song suzerainty. In 982, Li Jipeng of the Dingnan Jiedushi surrendered to the Song, but his cousin Li Jiqian rebelled. In 986, the Song attacked the Liao again. Song troops under Pan Mei, Cao Bin, and Yang Ye were defeated by a Liao army led personally by Empress Dowager Chengtian. Yang Ye was captured and died in captivity due to wound infection. In 993, Wang Xiaopo and Li Shun rebelled in Sichuan and were suppressed by 995. In 994, the Song deposed Li Jiqian. The Liao attacked the Song and laid siege to Zitong with 100,000 troops. They were repelled with the aid of fire arrows. Taizong died on 9 May 997, and was succeeded by his son, Zhao Heng, posthumously Emperor Zhenzong of Song. =Zhenzong (r. 997‚Äì1022)= Liao dynasty invasion of Song in 1004 Emperor Zhenzong of Song did not have any stomach for war so he legitimized Li Jiqian and appeased the Tanguts to the northwest with gold, brocade, money and tea. Li Jiqian captured Lingzhou in 1002. The Khitans immediately attacked in 998 but were forced to retreat in 1000 after failing to take key cities. They attacked again in 1001 and 1003 but were repulsed. Khitan aggression towards the Song culminated in a full scale invasion in 1004 by Emperor Shenzong of Liao. Khitan forces penetrated as far as Chanzhou at the Yellow River, within striking distance of Kaifeng. Zhenzong, Yang Si, and Yang Yanzhao (Yanlang) marched the Song army north to meet the Khitans in combat. In January 1005, the Khitan general Xiao Dalin was killed by a giant crossbow, crippling the Khitan offensive. Peace negotiations commenced from 13 to 18 January. In the resulting peace treaty, known as the Chanyuan Treaty, the two sides agreed to delineate their current territorial boundaries and for the Song to make annual installments of 200,000 bolts of raw silk and 100,000 taels of silver to the Liao as tribute. In 1000, Tang Fu demonstrated gunpowder pots and caltrops to the Song court and was rewarded. In 1002, Shi Pu demonstrated fireballs utilizing gunpowder to the Song court and blueprints were created for promulgation throughout the realm. Zhenzong died on 23 March 1022 and was succeeded by his son, Zhao Zhen, posthumously Emperor Renzong of Song. Empress Liu became regent. =Renzong (r. 1022‚Äì1063)= Expansion of Western Xia Emperor Renzong of Song was still a child when his father died, so Empress Liu became regent, ruling in his stead for the next 12 years until she died. By the time he came to power, the Song military had been without any practical combat experience for decades. In 1034, Li Yuanhao of the Tanguts raided Song dynasty On 10 November 1038, Li Yuanhao declared himself Emperor Jingzong of Western Xia. In the same year, rebellion broke out in Guangnan West Circuit and was suppressed. With the proclamation of their own dynasty, the Tanguts began a protracted campaign of military aggression against the Song, lasting six years until a truce was called in 1044. The Liao dynasty took advantage of the situation and attacked the Song as well. Although ultimately repelled, the Song agreed to increase annual tribute to 200,000 taels of silver and 300,000 bolts of silk. In 1043, the Yao people of Guiyang rebelled. It was only suppressed in 1051. In 1044, rebellion broke out in Guangnan West Circuit and Sichuan. In the same year, the chemical formula for gunpowder appeared in the military manual Wujing Zongyao, also known as the Complete Essentials for the Military Classics. \\"Thunderclap bombs\\" and a \\"triple-bed-crossbow\\" firing fire arrows were also mentioned in the Wujing Zongyao. In 1048, Wang Ze rebelled in Hebei and was suppressed. In 1049, Nong Zhigao of the Zhuang people rebelled in Guangnan West Circuit. He was suppressed in 1053. In 1055, Peng Shixi rebelled in Jinghu and was suppressed in 1058. In 1058, rebellion broke out in Yongzhou and was suppressed in 1061.

In 1072 and 1073, the Song defeated the Tibetans and conquered Xizhou and Hezhou. Sino‚ÄìVietnamese War (1075‚Äì1077): In November 1075, Vietnamese generals L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and N√πng T√¥ng ƒê√°n commanded 63,000 troops invaded the Song dynasty, capturing Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and destroying Yongzhou before retreating. In response, Emperor Shenzong proclaiming that ‚Äúthe [Vietnamese] king L√Ω C√†n ƒê·ª©c has revolted and attacked my fortresses and towns,‚Äù the Song emperor dispatched nine armies to ‚Äúend this tyrannical mode of government\\". The next year, Song general Guo Kui invaded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and pushed to the C·∫ßu River, where the war reached a stalemate. The war ended in 1077 with the Vietnamese L√Ω monarch agreed to becoming a Song tributary in return for the withdrawal of Song troops, despite they had inflicted heavy casualties on the Song Imperial army. In 1076, trade of gunpowder ingredients with the Liao and Western Xia dynasties was outlawed by the Song. In 1081, Song forces invaded Western Xia but forgot to bring siege weapons, resulting in a prolonged siege that caused extreme supply problems. They were forced to retreat with heavy casualties. In 1082, Western Xia conquered Yongle, a Song fort on their borders. In 1083, 300,000 fire arrows were produced by the Song court and delivered to two garrisons. Emperor Shenzong of Song died on 1 April 1085 and was succeeded by his son Zhao Xu, posthumously Emperor Zhezong of Song. Empress Gao became regent. =Zhezong (r. 1085‚Äì1100)= In 1098, the Western Xia retaliated against Song incursions but failed to defeat Song fortifications and sued for peace. Emperor Zhezong of Song died on 23 February 1100 and was succeeded by his brother Zhao Ji, posthumously Emperor Huizong of Song. =Huizong (r. 1100‚Äì1126)= Jin‚ÄìSong Wars The Song dynasty invaded Western Xia in 1003 and the war lasted for two years before ending inconclusively. In 1104, the Song dynasty annexed Tsongkha, a Tibetan polity on their western borders. In 1110, the Song army put on a firework display for the emperor including a spectacle which opened with \\"a noise like thunder\\" and explosives that light up the night. Considered by some to be the first mention of gunpowder fireworks. The Song invaded Western Xia again in 1113. The war ended inconclusively in 1119. In 1119, Song Jiang rebelled in Jingdong Circuit. He was suppressed in 1121. In 1120, Fang La rebelled in Liangzhe Circuit and was suppressed. In 1123, the Song invaded the Liao dynasty but was repelled. Zhang Jue rebelled in Pingzhou and defected to the Song but the Jin dynasty immediately retaliated and crushed his army. Zhang Jue was executed by the Song as reconciliation towards the Jin. In November 1125, the Jin dynasty invaded the Song and occupied Shanxi and Hebei, beginning the first of the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars. On 18 January 1126, Emperor Huizong of Song abdicated to his son Zhao Huan, who succeeded him as Emperor Qinzong of Song. =Qinzong (r. 1126‚Äì1127)= Jin dynasty in 1142 On 31 January 1126, the Jin dynasty laid siege to Kaifeng. Thunderclap bomb as well as fire arrows and fire bombs were used in the defense by Song troops. The Jin army retreated from Kaifeng after the Song promised to pay an annual indemnity. In June, the Jin defeated two Song armies. In December, the Jin returned with fire arrows and gunpowder bombs to lay siege to Kaifeng. On 12 June 1127, Emperor Qinzong of Song's brother Zhao Gou was declared Emperor Gaozong of Song and the capital was moved to Lin'an. Southern Song =Gaozong (r. 1127‚Äì1129, 1129‚Äì1162)= Battle of Yancheng between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin in 1140 In December 1127, Kaifeng fell to the Jin dynasty and emperors Qinzong and Huizong were captured; territory north of the Huai River was annexed by the Jin. This would come to be known as the Jingkang Incident. This was the earliest recorded use of \\"molten metal bombs\\", suspected to contain gunpowder. The earliest extant depiction of a cannon appeared among the Dazu Rock Carvings, completed in 1128, one of which is a human figure holding a gourd shaped hand cannon. In 1129, Song warships were outfitted with trebuchets and supplies of gunpowder bombs. In 1130, Jin forces were ambushed at the Battle of Huangtiandang and forced to stop at the Yangtze for some time before making the crossing. Zhong Xiang rebelled in Hunan and was not suppressed until 1135. In 1131, Jin forces invaded Shaanxi but were repelled, in particular by a volley fire tactic implemented by general Wu Jie (Âê≥ Áé†) and his younger brother Wu Lin (Âê≥Áíò). Li Cheng rebelled in Huainan and was suppressed. The Song established China's first standing navy. In 1132, Jin forces laid siege to De'an. In the Siege of De'an, fire lances were used by Song troops to repel the invaders. In the same year, gunpowder was referred to specifically for its military applications for the first time: \\"fire bomb medicine\\" rather than \\"fire medicine\\". Firecrackers using gunpowder were mentioned for the first time. In 1133, the Jin puppet state of Qi invaded the Song but was repelled by Yue Fei. In 1135, Qi captured Xiangyang, but Yue Fei retaliated and recaptured the lost territory. In 1136, Qi invaded Song territory again but was repelled. In 1140, the Jin invaded the Song and were repelled by Yue Fei at the Battle of Yancheng. However Yue Fei was ordered to retreat by Emperor Gaozong of Song in fear of further conflict with the Jin. Yue Fei was arrested and executed on 27 January 1142. In October 1142, the Song and Jin agreed to the Treaty of Shaoxing which stipulated that the Song must pay Jin an annual indemnity; the Huai River was settled as the boundary between the two states. On 28 October 1161, the Jin invaded the Song again. The forces led by Wanyan Liang easily defeated the Song forces and closed in on the Changjiang. However, using new fire arrows and thunderclap bombs, the Song dealt devastating losses to the Jin fleet at the Battle of Tangdao on 16 November and the Battle of Caishi on 27 November. On 24 July 1162, Gaozong abdicated to his adopted son Zhao Bocong, posthumously Emperor Xiaozong of Song. Wanlan Liang ambushed the forces of Wu Lin while they were retreating and defeated them. =Xiaozong (r. 1162‚Äì1189)= In the summer of 1163, Zhang Jun attacked the Jin using fire lances carts, but suffered defeat.

In 1204, Song forces began displaying military aggression on the Jin border. In June 1206, the Song declared war on the Jin. In December, the governor-general of Sichuan, Wu Xi, defected to the Jin, but he was killed on 29 March 1207 by loyalists. Thunderclap bombs were employed by Song forces in a sneak attack on a Jin camp, killing 2,000 men and 800 horses. The war entered a stalemate in April of 1207 and on 2 November 1208, the two sides agreed to restore the former status quo with the Song returning to tributary status. In 1208, a rebellion by the Yao people occurred in Jinghu and was suppressed. A rebellion in Sichuan also occurred. In 1210, a rebellion occurred in Jinghu and was suppressed. In 1211, a rebellion occurred in Sichuan. In 1214, Jin forces raided Song territory. In the spring of 1217, the Jin dynasty invaded the Song but was repelled. A rebellion broke out in Sichuan. In 1219, the Jin invaded the Song and was repelled. A rebellion broke out in Sichuan and was suppressed. In 1220, a rebellion occurred in Sichuan. In 1221, the Jin dynasty invaded the Song. They brought with them iron casing bombs which were employed in the siege of Qi Prefecture (Hubei). They were ultimately repelled. On 17 September 1224, Ningzong died and was succeeded by his adopted son Zhao Yun, posthumously Emperor Lizong of Song. The Song and Jin made peace in the same year. =Lizong (r. 1224‚Äì1264)= Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty Mongol conquest of China In 1230, co-viative projectiles were added to fire lances. In 1231, Song patrols killed a Mongol envoy. In retaliation the Mongols raided Sichuan. In the summer of 1233, the Song army took advantage of the Mongol invasion of the Jin dynasty, and attacked the Jin as well. In 1234, a Song army was annihilated by the Mongols at Luoyang. In 1235, Mongols raided Song territory. In 1236, Mongols routed Song forces in Sichuan. In 1237, Mongols employed large bombs requiring several hundred men to hurl using trebuchets in the siege of Anfeng (modern Shouxian, Anhui Province). In 1238, counterattacks by Song forces forced the Mongols to withdraw. In 1242 and 1243, Mongols raided Sichuan. In 1244, Mongols raided Huainan. In 1245, Mongols occupied Shouzhou. Rockets were used during a military exercise conducted by the Song navy. In 1246, Mongols raided Huainan. In 1252, Mongol forces under the Chinese general Wang Dechen advanced into Sichuan and occupied Lizhou. In the summer of 1256, M√∂ngke Khan declared war on the Song, citing imprisonment of Mongol envoys as casus belli. In 1257, 333 \\"fire emitting tubes\\" were produced in a Song arsenal in Jiankangzhou (Nanjing, Jiangsu). In 1258, Mongol forces captured Chengdu. In January of 1259, Mongol forces captured Yazhou. M√∂ngke Khan laid siege to Diaoyu Castle from February to July and retreated. He died on 12 August from a wound inflicted by a Song trebuchet, forcing Mongol forces to withdraw from Song territory. According to the History of Song, in 1259, a \\"fire-emitting lance\\" employed a pellet wad projectile which occluded the barrel. Some consider this to be the first bullet. On 22 February of 1262, Mongol-allied warlord of Shandong, Li Tan, defected to the Song dynasty In August, Kublai Khan's Chinese generals Shi Tianze and Shi Chu crushed Li Tan's forces and captured him; Li Tan was trampled to death by horses In 1264, Emperor Lizong of Song died and was succeeded by his nephew Zhao Qi, posthumously Emperor Duzong of Song. =Duzong (r. 1264‚Äì1274)= Song dynasty cavalry In 1265, Song and Mongol forces clashed in Sichuan. In 1268, Aju of the Mongols laid siege to Xiangyang. In 1271, Kublai Khan declared himself emperor of the Yuan dynasty. In 1272, riverine relief forces used fire lances to repel boarders and broke the Mongol blockade of Xiangyang. In March of 1273, L√º Wenhuan surrendered Xiangyang to Yuan. On 12 August of 1274, Emperor Duzong of Song died and was succeeded by his son Zhao Xian, posthumously Emperor Gong of Song; Xie Daoqing became regent. =Gong (r. 1274‚Äì1276)= In January of 1275, Bayan's forces crossed the Yangtze at Hankou and in March met Jia Sidao in battle at Dingjiaozhou, annihilating his force using artillery equipment, conquering the Hanshui region. On 22 March 1276, Lin'an surrendered to the Mongols and Emperor Gong of Song was eventually moved to Dunhuang where he raised a family and became a monk. On 14 June, loyalists enthroned Zhao Shi, the former emperor's brother, posthumously known as Emperor Duanzong of Song. =Duanzong (r. 1276‚Äì1278)= Mongol invasion of the Song dynasty (1234‚Äì79) In 1276, Mongol forces defeated a Song army near modern Guichi District. Arigh Kaya conquered Hunan and Guangxi while Sodu occupied Fuzhou. At this point, reusable fire lance barrels made of metal were employed by the Song army. In April 1277, Muslim superintendent of Quanzhou Pu Shougeng defeced to Yuan. In 1278, Sodu occupied Guangzhou. On 9 May 1278, Duanzong died in Guangnan and was succeeded by his brother Zhao Bing. =Zhao Bing (r. 1278‚Äì1279)= On 19 March 1279, the Mongol fleet annihilated the Song fleet at the Battle of Yamen. Zhao Bing died at sea; so ended the Song dynasty. Organization =Army= In the year 960 the Song military had 378,000 enlisted soldiers. Around the turn of the 11th century its size had grown to 900,000 soldiers, increasing to 1,000,000 by the year 1022, and well over 1,250,000 by 1041.Ebrey et al., East Asia, 164.Gernet, 72.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 138. The overall expenses of upholding a military of this size consumed three-quarters of the state's entire annual revenue. To lessen the expense, in 1069 the Chancellor Wang Anshi created the institution of local militias as supporting units. In 1073, Wang Anshi created a new bureau of the central government called the Directorate of Weapons, which supervised the manufacture of armaments and ensured quality control.Peers, 130. The Northern Song military was headed by the Bureau of Military Affairs, the highest level of military administration. Executive officials of the Bureau of Military Affairs were second in position only to the chief councilors. While officially the highest functioning military organ, the Bureau of Military Affairs co-existed with the Three Capital Guards: the Palace Command, the Metropolitan Cavalry Command, and the Metropolitan Infantry Command. Together these two systems served as a mutual check and restraint on each other. Because of the Song's promotion of civil government, the Bureau of Military Affairs became increasingly occupied by civil officials. By the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song (r. 8 May 997 ‚Äì 23 March 1022), only 34 percent of senior officials in the Bureau were military officers. The emperor himself did not directly lead the military. Technically, the Northern Song maintained a system of three different levels of armies: the upper imperial armies, middle imperial armies, and lower imperial armies. The upper imperial armies alone consisted of four separate armies. However, after the beginning of Emperor Taizong of Song's reign (r. 15 November 976 ‚Äì 8 May 997), military organization was localized to the commandery level for all practical troop movements, fortifications, and battles. Generals and commandery units were deliberately kept apart and unfamiliar with each other to prevent rebellion. The Song dynasty did not have military conscription but rather recruited through volunteers. The strong and fit were sent to the capital as models and guides for other soldiers. Soldiers were required to tattoo their faces or arms with the designation of their military unit. Infantry units were organized 50 men to a platoon, two platoons to a company, and five companies to a battalion.Lorge, 45. During the Northern Song, half of the entire army of 1 million was stationed in and around Kaifeng. The remaining troops were posted in scattered forces along borders and near large municipalities, and in peacetime were used as means to maintain local security. Prefectural armies were created as reserves. They received no military training and were mainly used for industrial labor such as wall and road repair, river dike building, bridge construction, and transportation. Song crossbowmen constituted their own separate units apart from the infantry, and according to the Chinese Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044, the crossbow used in mass was the most effective weapon used against northern nomadic cavalry charges. Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long-range snipers; such was the case when the Liao general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004. Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces.Peers, 130‚Äì131. Song cavalry used an array of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, and fire lances that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.Peers, 131. In preparation for war, government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities, with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year, along with armor components by the tens of thousands. There were sixteen known varieties of catapults in the Song period, designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men. For a number of reasons such as corruption, focus on civil government, and distrust of the military, the Song army was generally ineffective despite the empire's material wealth. While the culture of the Song dynasty abhorred military subjects, its bureaucracy also codified and implemented new standards for soldiers. The military examination was observed and elite soldiers were allocated different responsibilities based on examination of their individual capabilities. The History of Song notes that the Song army had access to new weapons as gunpowder bombs and fire arrows, good armour, and were well supplied with traditional arms, but its military performance in practice still left much to be desired. = Cavalry = Armoured Song cavalry The Song dynasty did not possess much in the way of warhorses. Without the horse-producing lands of the northwest, the Song managed to raise 200,000 horses during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song and 150,000 during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song, down from 700,000 during the height of the Tang dynasty. To supplement their cavalry, the Song bought every year ten to forty thousand horses from the northwest and southwest borderlands. The Dali Kingdom's horses were highly prized and sought after as military assets, especially after the fall of the Northern Song. They were described by a Song official in the following passage: Due to the lack of their own cavalry forces, the Song army usually had to rely on anti-cavalry infantry equipped with \\"horse-butchering sabres\\", large axes, and crossbows to overcome the Khitans and Jurchens. A faded and worn Song painting of the 12th century showing cavalrymen in the rear with horses wearing armor. With the Khitan and Tangut kingdoms possessing much of the pasture and grazing lands in the north, the Song military had a shortage of horses for cavalry.Peers, 129. To make up for this shortage, statesmen like Wang Anshi advocated greater ties with Tibet, as the tea-horse trade with Tibet was continued by the Ming dynasty.Sperling, 474‚Äì475.Perdue, 273. = Tribal Auxiliaries = The Song military fielded included auxiliary forces drawn from frontier ethnic groups. Tribal families under Song rule was referred to as Shuhu. The original chief of the tribe was be designated as Supreme Unit Master or dujunzhu, smaller tribe leaders were designated commanders (fanguan). Command was hereditary in accordance with tribal customs of chieftainship. The Song government issued them with land. Deployment was permanent and never rotated unlike regular army forces, and promotion or demotion was restricted to the internal structure of each unit. Their promotions were also restricted to Prefect and Garrison- General at the highest level unlike regular officers. In 1017, the fanluo battalions of tribal warriors were formed as part of the Central Imperial Palace army and used to suppress the rebellion of Nong Zhigao in Guangxi. There was strong court resistance to the idea of tribal officers outranking Han Chinese officers, and the government wavered back-and-forth on the policy of permitting this. The tribal auxiliaries were described by both Song sources and their enemies as highly effective. These included \\"Western soldiers\\" (fanbing), drawn from Tibetan and Tangut tribes along the northwestern frontier. These tribes defected to the Song due to inter-tribal conflict and played an essential role in Song defence policy due to the large numbers of cavalry they provided. The Song dynasty took great effort to maintain cordial ties with them. However unlike previous dynasties these forces were restricted to the localities from which they were drawn, rather than deployed to other fronts. The Song elite avoided the multi-ethnic military command structure of the Tang dynasty that preceded it as this was viewed as having led to the devastating An Lushan Rebellion (started by a military governor of foreign descent) that caused the dynasty's decline and collapse. This made the Song reluctant to rely on non-Han Chinese for any purposes. The Song dynasty did not model its military infrastructure and organization on the precedent of northern nomadic armies, such as the earlier Xianbei and later Mongols.Graff, 26. Only twice in the Song era were steppe people employed in Song cavalry units: in the beginning of the dynasty with the campaigns of Emperor Taizu who employed Kumo Xi horse archers, and later 13th century Mongol defectors who came over to fight for the Song. = Navy = A Song river ship with a Xuanfeng traction-trebuchet catapult on its top deck, taken from an illustration of the Wujing Zongyao (1044 AD). The Song dynasty maintained substantial naval forces during its establishment in the 10th century and then a permanent navy in the 12th century. Many of the warships in the Song navy were paddle-wheel driven crafts and some Song naval ships could carry up to 1,000 soldiers.Graff, 86‚Äì87. The Song period also saw the first ships armed with gunpowder weapons such as bombs and fire arrows.Graff, 87. The use of enormous pontoon bridges in the Song era on at least one occasion was essential to victory. The Song built a large floating bridge across the Yangtze River in 974; while troops were under attack, the pontoon bridge was used as a means of transport for troops and supplies to the other bank during the early Song conquest of the Southern Tang state. =Weapons production= Weapons production was handled through the Armaments Section of the Salt and Iron Monopoly Bureau of the State Finance Commission. However the Armaments Section was abolished during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song and replaced with the Directorate for Armaments. Other organizations such as the Armaments Office were also responsible for weapons production. The primary production facilities were located in Kaifeng. There, body armour was produced by the Southern and Northern Workshops (later the Eastern and Western Workshops) while bows and crossbows were produced by the Bow Workshop and Bow and Arrow Workshop. Siege machinery was produced at the Siege Provisioning Workshop. At its height during the Northern Song period, the Bow Workshop had under its employ 1,042 weapons makers, the Bow and Arrow Workshop 1,071 weapons makers, the Southern Workshop 3,741 craftsmen, and the Northern Workshop 4,190 craftsmen. The Southern and Northern Workshops were further divided into the Wood Shop, the Horse Armour Shop, and the Sword-Sharpening Shop. The Siege Provisioning Workshop was also responsible for gunpowder and flamethrower weapons in addition to other siege weapons. In total, the Northern Song dynasty was able to produce every year 32,000 items of iron armour and 22.7 million bows, crossbows, and arrows. =Logistics= According to Song laws and regulations, camels could carry 150 kg each, horses and mules 165 kg, and donkeys 110 kg. If one soldier could carry 66 kg of food with three food porters, that would last them 31 days. Armour During the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) it became fashionable to create warts on pieces of armour to imitate cold forged steel, a product typically produced by non-Han people in modern Qinghai. Warts created from cold work were actually spots of higher carbon in the original steel, thus aesthetic warts on non-cold forged steel served no purpose. According to Shen Kuo, armour constructed of cold forged steel was impenetrable to arrows shot at a distance of 50 paces. Even if the arrow happened to hit a drill hole, the arrowhead was the one which was ruined. However crossbows were still prized for their ability to penetrate heavy armour. The History of Song notes that Song \\"tools of war were exceedingly effective, never before seen in recent times,\\" and \\"their weapons and armor were very good\\", but \\"their troops weren't always effective.\\" File:Song axeman.pngLamellar armoured axe wielder File:Song armour.pngSong dynasty soldiers wearing lamellar and mountain pattern armour.

From Zeng Gongliang ÊõæÂÖ¨‰∫Æ, Complete Essentials for the Military Classics Preceding Volume (Wujing Zongyao qian ji Ê≠¶Á∂ìÁ∏ΩË¶ÅÂâçÈõÜ), ca. 1044 CE. The Wujing Zongyao, written during the Song dynasty, notes that during the Tang period, crossbows were not used to their full effectiveness due to the fear of cavalry charges. The author's solution was to drill the soldiers to the point where rather than hide behind shieldbearers upon the approach of enemy soldier, they would \\"plant the feet like a firm mountain, and, unmoving at the front of the battle arrays, shoot thickly to the middle [of the enemy], and none among them will not fall down dead.\\" The Song volley fire formation was described thus: \\"Those in the center of the formation should load while those on the outside of the formation should shoot, and when [the enemy gets] close, then they should shelter themselves with small shields [literally side shields, ÊóÅÁâå], each taking turns and returning, so that those who are loading are within the formation. In this way the crossbows will not cease sounding.\\" In addition to the Tang formation, the Song illustration also added a new label to the middle line of crossbowmen between the firing and reloading lines, known as the \\"advancing crossbows.\\" Both Tang and Song manuals also made aware to the reader that \\"the accumulated arrows should be shot in a stream, which means that in front of them there must be no standing troops, and across [from them] no horizontal formations.\\" The volley fire technique was used to great effect by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. In the fall of 1131 the Jin commander Wuzhu (ÂÖÄÊúÆ) invaded the Shaanxi region but was defeated by general Wu Jie (Âê≥ Áé†) and his younger brother Wu Lin (Âê≥Áíò). The History of Song elaborates on the battle in detail: After losing half his army Wuzhu escaped back to the north, only to invade again in the following year. Again, he was defeated while trying to breach a strategic pass. The History of Song states that during the battle Wu Jie's brother Wu Lin \\"used the Standing-Firm Arrow Teams, who shot alternately, and the arrows fell like rain, and the dead piled up in layers, but the enemy climbed over them and kept climbing up.\\" This passage is especially noteworthy for its mention of a special technique being utilized as it is one of the very few times that the History of Song has elaborated on a specific tactic. =Mounted crossbow= Connected double bow crossbow Large mounted crossbows known as \\"bed crossbows\\" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as humongous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with cords attached so that they could be pulled back. By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used as mobile field artillery and known as \\"Military Strong Carts\\". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256. According Juvayni, Hulagu Khan brought with him 3,000 giant crossbows from China, for the siege of Nishapur, and a team of Chinese technicians to work a great 'ox bow' shooting large bolts a distance of 2,500 paces, which was used at the siege of Maymun Diz. Constructing these weapons, especially the casting of the large triggers, and their operation required the highest order of technical expertise available at the time. They were primarily used from the 8th to 11th centuries. Joseph Needham on the range of the triple-bow crossbow: Gunpowder weapons A fire arrow utilizing a bag of gunpowder as incendiary. As depicted in the Huolongjing (c. 1390). Chinese flamethrower from the Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 AD, Song Dynasty. The text reads from top to bottom: ignition chamber, horizontal tank, piston rod, and fierce-fire oil tank cabinet installed form. =Gunpowder formula= The earliest surviving chemical formula of gunpowder dates to 1044 in the form of the military manual Wujing Zongyao, also known in English as the Complete Essentials for the Military Classics, which contains a collection of factoids on Chinese weaponry. The Wujing Zongyao served as a repository of antiquated or fanciful weaponry, and this applied to gunpowder as well, suggesting that it had already been weaponized long before the invention of what would today be considered conventional firearms. These types of gunpowder weapons styles an assortment of odd names such as \\"flying incendiary club for subjugating demons\\", \\"caltrop fire ball\\", \\"ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb\\", \\"big bees nest\\", \\"burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb\\", \\"fire bricks\\" which released \\"flying swallows\\", \\"flying rats\\", \\"fire birds\\", and \\"fire oxen\\". Eventually they gave way and coalesced into a smaller number of dominant weapon types, notably gunpowder arrows, bombs, and guns. This was most likely because some weapons were deemed too onerous or ineffective to deploy. =Fire arrow= The first fire arrows (hu«íy√†o ÁÅ´Ëó•) were arrows strapped with gunpowder incendiaries, but in 969 two Song generals, Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng (È¶ÆÁπºÂçá), invented a variant fire arrow which utilized gunpowder tubes as propellants. Afterwards fire arrows started transitioning to rocket propelled weapons rather than being fired from a bow. These fire arrows were shown to the emperor in 970 when the head of a weapons manufacturing bureau sent Feng Jisheng to demonstrate the gunpowder arrow design, for which he was heavily rewarded. In 975, the state of Wuyue sent to the Song dynasty a unit of soldiers skilled in the handling of fire arrows. In the same year, the Song dynasty used fire arrows and incendiary bombs to destroy the fleet of Southern Tang. In 994, the Liao dynasty attacked the Song and laid siege to Zitong with 100,000 troops. They were repelled with the aid of fire arrows. In 1000 a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (ÂîêÁ¶è) also demonstrated his own designs of gunpowder arrows, gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire), and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded as well. The imperial court took great interest in the progress of gunpowder developments and actively encouraged as well as disseminated military technology. For example, in 1002 a local militia man named Shi Pu (Áü≥ÊôÆ) showed his own versions of fireballs and gunpowder arrows to imperial officials. They were so astounded that the emperor and court decreed that a team would be assembled to print the plans and instructions for the new designs to promulgate throughout the realm. The Song court's policy of rewarding military innovators was reported to have \\"brought about a great number of cases of people presenting technology and techniques\\" (Âô®Ê¢∞Ê≥ïÂºè) according to the official History of Song. Production of gunpowder and fire arrows heavily increased in the 11th century as the court centralized the production process, constructing large gunpowder production facilities, hiring artisans, carpenters, and tanners for the military production complex in the capital of Kaifeng. One surviving source circa 1023 lists all the artisans working in Kaifeng while another notes that in 1083 the imperial court sent 100,000 gunpowder arrows to one garrison and 250,000 to another. Evidence of gunpowder in the Liao dynasty and Western Xia is much sparser than in Song, but some evidence such as the Song decree of 1073 that all subjects were henceforth forbidden from trading sulfur and saltpeter across the Liao border, suggests that the Liao were aware of gunpowder developments to the south and coveted gunpowder ingredients of their own.

It is activated by a trap-like mechanism, possibly of wheellock design. =Flamethrower= The Chinese flamethrower, known as the Fierce-fire Oil Cabinet, was recorded to have been used in 976 AD when Song naval forces confronted the Southern Tang fleet on the Changjiang. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. The flamethrower was a well known device by the 11th century when it was joked that Confucian scholars knew it better than the classics. Both gunpowder and the fierce fire oil were produced under the Arsenals Administration of the Song dynasty. In the early 12th century AD, Kang Yuzhi recorded his memories of military commanders testing out fierce oil fire on a small lakelet. They would spray it about on the opposite bank that represented the enemy camp. The flames would ignite into a sheet of flame, destroying the wooden fortifications, and even killing the water plants, fishes and turtles.In 1126 AD, Li Gang used flamethrowers in an attempt to prevent the Jurchens from crossing the Yellow River. Illustrations and descriptions of mobile flamethrowers on four-wheel push carts were documented in the Wujing Zongyao, written in 1044 AD (its illustration redrawn in 1601 as well). =Explosives= An illustration of a thunderclap bomb as depicted in the 1044 text Wujing Zongyao. The top item is a through awl and the bottom one is a hook awl, used to ignite the projectile before it was hurled. The Jurchen people of Manchuria united under Wanyan Aguda and established the Jin dynasty in 1115. Allying with the Song, they rose rapidly to the forefront of East Asian powers and defeated the Liao dynasty in a short span of time. Remnants of the Liao fled to the west and became known as the Qara Khitai, or Western Liao to the Chinese. In the east, the fragile Song-Jin alliance dissolved once the Jin saw how badly the Song army had performed against Liao forces. The Jin grew tired of waiting and captured all five of the Liao capitals themselves. They proceeded to make war on Song, initiating the Jin-Song Wars. This was the first time two major powers would have access to equally formidable gunpowder weapons. Initially the Jin expected their campaign in the south to proceed smoothly given how poorly the Song had fared against the Liao. However they were met with stout resistance upon besieging Kaifeng in 1126 and faced the usual array of gunpowder arrows and fire bombs, but also a weapon called the \\"thunderclap bomb\\" (ÈúπÈùÇÁÇÆ), which one witness wrote, \\"At night the thunderclap bombs were used, hitting the lines of the enemy well, and throwing them into great confusion. Many fled, screaming in fright.\\" The thunderclap bomb was previously mentioned in the Wujing Zongyao, but this was the first recorded instance of its use. Its description in the text reads thus: Jin troops withdrew with a ransom of Song silk and treasure but returned several months later with their own gunpowder bombs manufactured by captured Song artisans. According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the \\"earliest truly detailed descriptions of the use of gunpowder weapons in warfare.\\" Records show that the Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and trebuchets to hurl gunpowder bombs while the Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the \\"molten metal bomb\\" (ÈáëÊ±ÅÁÇÆ). As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their \\"fire bombs fell like rain, and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable.\\" The Jin captured Kaifeng despite the appearance of the molten metal bomb and secured another 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal. The molten metal bomb appeared again in 1129 when Song general Li Yanxian (ÊùéÂΩ•‰ªô) clashed with Jin forces while defending a strategic pass. The Jin assault lasted day and night without respite, using siege carts, fire carts, and sky bridges, but each assault was met with Song soldiers who \\"resisted at each occasion, and also used molten metal bombs. Wherever the gunpowder touched, everything would disintegrate without a trace.\\" =Fire lance= Two different types of fire lances. The fire lance was an anti-personnel gunpowder weapon with a relatively short range. Considered by many to be the first proto-gun. The fire lance, as implied by the name, is essentially a long spear or pole affixed with a tube of gunpowder, and as it saw more usage, the tube's length became longer and pellets were added to the composition. The earliest confirmed employment of the fire lance in warfare was by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the siege of De'an (modern Anlu, Hubei Province). The Jin attacked with wooden siege towers called \\"sky bridges\\": \\"As the sky bridges became stuck fast, more than ten feet from the walls and unable to get any closer, [the defenders] were ready. From below and above the defensive structures they emerged and attacked with fire lances, striking lances, and hooked sickles, each in turn. The people [i.e., the porters] at the base of the sky bridges were repulsed. Pulling their bamboo ropes, they [the porters] ended up drawing the sky bridge back in an anxious and urgent rush, going about fifty paces before stopping.\\" The surviving porters then tried once again to wheel the sky bridges into place but Song soldiers emerged from the walls in force and made a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers while defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were also set fire to with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood. Li Heng, the Jin commander, decided to lift the siege and Jin forces were driven back with severe casualties. The siege of De'an marks an important transition and landmark in the history of gunpowder weapons as the fire medicine of the fire lances were described using a new word: \\"fire bomb medicine\\" (ÁÅ´ÁÇÆËó•), rather than simply \\"fire medicine.\\" This could imply the use of a new more potent formula, or simply an acknowledgement of the specialized military application of gunpowder. Peter Lorge suggests that this \\"bomb powder\\" may have been corned, making it distinct from normal gunpowder. Evidence of gunpowder firecrackers also points to their appearance at roughly around the same time fire medicine was making its transition in the literary imagination. Fire lances continued to be used as anti-personnel weapons into the Ming dynasty, and were even attached to battle carts on one situation in 1163. Song commander Wei Sheng constructed several hundred of these carts known as \\"at-your-desire-war-carts\\" (Â¶ÇÊÑèÊà∞Ëªä), which contained fire lances protruding from protective covering on the sides. They were used to defend mobile trebuchets that hurled fire bombs. =Naval bombs= Gunpowder technology also spread to naval warfare and in 1129 Song decreed that all warships were to be fitted with trebuchets for hurling gunpowder bombs. Older gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows were also utilized. In 1159 a Song fleet of 120 ships caught a Jin fleet at anchor near Shijiu Island (Áü≥ËáºÂ≥∂) off the shore of Shandong peninsula. The Song commander \\"ordered that gunpowder arrows be shot from all sides, and wherever they struck, flames and smoke rose up in swirls, setting fire to several hundred vessels.\\" Song forces took another victory in 1161 when Song paddle boats ambushed a Jin transport fleet, launched thunderclap bombs, and drowned the Jin force in the Yangtze. According to a minor military official by the name of Zhao Wannian (Ë∂ôËê¨Âπ¥), thunderclap bombs were used again to great effect by the Song during the Jin siege of Xiangyang in 1206‚Äì1207. Both sides had gunpowder weapons, but the Jin troops only used gunpowder arrows for destroying the city's moored vessels. The Song used fire arrows, fire bombs, and thunderclap bombs. Fire arrows and bombs were used to destroy Jin trebuchets. The thunderclap bombs were used on Jin soldiers themselves, causing foot soldiers and horsemen to panic and retreat. \\"We beat our drums and yelled from atop the city wall, and simultaneously fired our thunderclap missiles out from the city walls. The enemy cavalry was terrified and ran away.\\" The Jin were forced to retreat and make camp by the riverside. In a rare occurrence, the Song made a successful offensive on Jin forces and conducted a night assault using boats. They were loaded with gunpowder arrows, thunderclap bombs, a thousand crossbowmen, five hundred infantry, and a hundred drummers. Jin troops were surprised in their encampment while asleep by loud drumming, followed by an onslaught of crossbow bolts, and then thunderclap bombs, which caused a panic of such magnitude that they were unable to even saddle themselves and trampled over each other trying to get away. Two to three thousand Jin troops were slaughtered along with eight to nine hundred horses. Competing with gunpowder empires A 'magic fire meteor going against the wind' bomb as depicted in the Huolongjing. A 'bone-burning and bruising fire-oil magic bomb' (lan gu huo you shen pao ÁàõÈ™®ÁÅ´Ê≤πÁ•ûÁ†≤) fragmentation bomb from the Huolongjing. It is composed of a cast iron casing, iron pellets coated in tung oil, urine, sal ammoniac, feces, and scallion juice. In the middle is a gunpowder stick. Stoneware bombs, known in Japanese as Tetsuhau (iron bomb), or in Chinese as Zhentianlei (thunder crash bomb), excavated from the Takashima shipwreck, October 2011, dated to the Mongol invasions of Japan (1271‚Äì1284 AD). =Hard-shell explosives= Traditionally the inspiration for the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise. The invention of hard shell explosives did not occur in the Song dynasty. Instead it was introduced to them by the northern Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1221 during the siege of Qizhou (in modern Hubei province). The Song commander Zhao Yurong (Ë∂ôËàáË§£) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity. Qizhou was a major fortress city situated near the Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand \\"great leather bombs\\" (ÁöÆÂ§ßÁÇÆ), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, they were unable to match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, \\"The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb [catapult shot], whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [our own] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [of the face] was left.\\" Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: \\"The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [Â∏≥] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, to the point that they struck even on top of [my] sleeping quarters and [I] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?\\" Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, \\"In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake.\\" Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the \\"bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who.\\" =Eruptors and cannons= The early fire lance, considered to be the ancestor of firearms, is not considered a true gun because it did not include projectiles. Later on, shrapnel such as ceramics and bits of iron were added, but these didn't occlude the barrel, and were only swept along with the discharge rather than make use of windage. These projectiles were called \\"co- viatives.\\" The commonplace nature of the fire lance, if not in quantity, was apparent by the mid 13th century, and in 1257 an arsenal in Jiankang Prefecture reported the manufacture of 333 \\"fire emitting tubes\\" (Á™ÅÁÅ´Á≠í). In 1259 a type of \\"fire-emitting lance\\" (Á™ÅÁÅ´Êßç) made an appearance and according to the History of Song: \\"It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (Â≠êÁ™†). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is like a bomb that can be heard for five hundred or more paces.\\" The pellet wad mentioned is possibly the first true bullet in recorded history depending on how bullet is defined, as it did occlude the barrel, unlike previous co-viatives used in the fire lance. Fire lances transformed from the \\"bamboo- (or wood- or paper-) barreled firearm to the metal-barreled firearm\\" to better withstand the explosive pressure of gunpowder. From there it branched off into several different gunpowder weapons known as \\"eruptors\\" in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with different functions such as the \\"filling-the-sky erupting tube\\" which spewed out poisonous gas and porcelain shards, the \\"orifice-penetrating flying sand magic mist tube\\" (ÈëΩÁ©¥È£õÁ†ÇÁ•ûÈúßÁ≠í) which spewed forth sand and poisonous chemicals into orifices, and the more conventional \\"phalanx-charging fire gourd\\" which shot out lead pellets. The character for lance, or spear (Êßç), has continued to refer to both the melee weapon and the firearm into modern China, perhaps as a reminder of its original form as simply a tube of gunpowder tied to a spear. Traditionally the first appearance of the hand cannon is dated to the late 13th century, just after the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty. However a sculpture depicting a figure carrying a gourd shaped hand cannon was discovered among the Dazu Rock Carvings in 1985 by Robin Yates. The sculptures were completed roughly 250 km northwest of Chongqing by 1128, after the fall of Kaifeng to the Jin dynasty. If the dating is correct this would push back the appearance of the cannon in China by a hundred years more than previously thought. The bulbous nature of the cannon is congruous with the earliest hand cannons discovered in China and Europe. Archaeological samples of the gun, specifically the hand cannon (huochong), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the Xanadu Gun, so called because it was discovered in the ruins of Xanadu, the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7 cm in length and weighs 6.2 kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun, it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length. Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it. One candidate is the Heilongjiang hand cannon, discovered in 1970, and named after the province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China.Chase, Kenneth Warren (2003). Firearms: A Global History to 1700. Cambridge University Press, p. 32, .Needham, Joseph (1986), Science & Civilisation in China, V:7: The Gunpowder Epic, Cambridge University Press, p. 293, . It is small and light like the Xanadu gun, weighing only 3.5 kilograms, 34 cm (Needham says 35 cm), and a bore of approximately 2.5 cm. Based on contextual evidence, historians believe it was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan. The Ningxia gun was found in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region by collector Meng Jianmin (Â≠üÂª∫Ê∞ë). This Yuan dynasty firearm is 34.6 cm long, the muzzle 2.6 cm in diameter, and weighs 1.55 kilograms. The firearm contains a transcription reading, \\"Made by bronzesmith Li Liujing in the year Zhiyuan 8 (Áõ¥ÂÖÉ), ningzi number 2565\\" (ÈäÖÂå†‰ΩúÈ†≠ÊùéÂÖ≠ÂæëÔºåÁõ¥ÂÖÉÊçåÂπ¥ÈÄ†ÔºåÂØßÂ≠ó‰∫å‰ªü‰ºçÁôæÈô∏Êãæ‰ºçËôü). Similar to the Xanadu Gun, it bears a serial number 2565, which suggests it may have been part of a series of guns manufactured. While the era name and date corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1271 CE, putting it earlier than both the Heilongjiang Hand Gun as well as the Xanadu Gun, but one of the characters used in the era name is irregular, causing some doubt among scholars on the exact date of production. Another specimen, the Wuwei Bronze Cannon, was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in Wuwei, Gansu Province containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative. Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery. While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997, but much smaller in size at only 1.5 kg. Chen Bingying disputes this however, and argues there were no guns before 1259, while Dang Shoushan believes the Western Xia guns point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200. Sinologist Joseph Needham and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the \\"true\\" cannon. Whether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century. =Late Song gunpowder weaponry= By the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons were available to both the Mongols and the Song. The Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern Shouxian, Anhui Province) \\"using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers.\\" These bombs were apparently quite large. \\"Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces.\\" The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (ÊùúÊù≤) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the \\"Elipao,\\" after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon. Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found \\"no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!\\" Fortunately for the Song, M√∂ngke Khan died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of Kublai Khan, but when it did the Mongols came in full force. Blocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. For the first three years the Song defenders had been able to receive supplies and reinforcements by water, but in 1271 the Mongols set up a full blockade with a formidable navy of their own, isolating the two cities. This didn't prevent the Song from running the supply route anyway, and two men with the surname Zhang did exactly that. The Two Zhangs commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, but were discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with \\"vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter.\\" Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water. The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, \\"on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood.\\" With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens \\"leapt up a hundred times in joy.\\" In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, \\"when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed.\\" The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273. The next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that \\"the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven.\\" Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred. Gunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: \\"if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows.\\" This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million. The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the History of Song writes, \\"the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [outside] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, not a trace left.\\" So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.

Antennas can be classified in various ways. The list below groups together antennas under common operating principles, following the way antennas are classified in many engineering textbooks. The dipole, monopole, array and large loop antenna types below typically function as resonant antennas; waves of current and voltage bounce back and forth between the ends, creating standing waves along the elements. Aperture antennas can be resonant or not. Traveling wave antennas are nonresonant types, the current and voltage waves travel in one direction along the antenna elements. Isotropic An isotropic antenna (isotropic radiator) is a hypothetical antenna that radiates equal signal power in all directions. It is a mathematical model that is used as the base of comparison to calculate the directionality or gain of real antennas. No real antenna can have an isotropic radiation pattern, but the isotropic radiation pattern serves as reference for comparing the radiation intensity of other antennas, regardless of type. An \\"isotropic antenna\\" should not be confused with an \\"omnidirectional antenna\\"; an isotropic antenna radiates equal power in all three dimensions, while an omnidirectional antenna radiates equal power in all horizontal directions, with the power radiated varying with elevation angle, but decreasing to zero along the antenna's vertical axis. Nearly isotropic antennas can be constructed using multiple small elements, and are used as reference antennas for testing other antennas and for field strength measurements, and for backup antennas on satellites which work without the satellite being oriented towards a communication station. Dipole File:Rabbit-ears dipole antenna with UHF loop 20090204.jpg\\"Rabbit ears\\" dipole variant for VHF television reception File:SatelliteAntenna-137MHz closeup.jpgTwo-element turnstile antenna for reception of weather satellite data, 137 MHz. Has circular polarization. File:Corner reflector TV antenna.pngCorner reflector UHF TV antenna with \\"bowtie\\" dipole driven element at its center The dipole is the prototypical antenna on which a large class of antennas are based. A basic dipole antenna consists of two conductors (usually metal rods or wires) arranged symmetrically, with one side of the balanced feedline from the transmitter or receiver attached to each. The most common type, the half-wave dipole, consists of two resonant elements just under a quarter wavelength long. This antenna radiates maximally in directions perpendicular to the antenna's axis, giving it a small directive gain of 2.15 dBi. Although half-wave dipoles are used alone as omnidirectional antennas, they are also a building block of many other more complicated directional antennas. * Turnstile ‚Äì Two dipole antennas mounted at right angles, fed with a phase difference of 90¬∞. This antenna is unusual in that it radiates in all directions (no nulls in the radiation pattern), with horizontal polarization in directions coplanar with the elements, circular polarization normal to that plane, and elliptical polarization in other directions. Used for receiving signals from satellites, as circular polarization is transmitted by many satellites. * Corner reflector ‚Äì A directive antenna with moderate gain of about 8 dBi often used at UHF frequencies. Consists of a dipole mounted in front of two reflective metal screens joined at an angle, usually 90¬∞. Used as a rooftop UHF television antenna and for point-to-point data links. * Patch (microstrip) ‚Äì A type of antenna with elements consisting of metal sheets mounted over a ground plane. Similar to dipole with gain of 6‚Äì9 dBi. Integrated into surfaces such as aircraft bodies. Their easy fabrication using PCB techniques have made them popular in modern wireless devices. Often combined into arrays.

File:Antenne gp vhf 3.jpgVHF ground plane antenna File:Amateur T cage antenna 2BML 1922-colorized.jpgT-antenna of amateur radio station, 80 ft high, used at 1.5 MHz. File:Sendemast Hirschlanden.jpgMast radiator antenna of medium wave AM radio station, Germany File:FoldedUnipoleMidPoint.jpgFolded unipole with skirt wires connected at a midpoint on the tower A monopole antenna consists of a single conductor such as a metal rod, usually mounted over the ground or an artificial conducting surface (a so-called ground plane). One side of the feedline from the receiver or transmitter is connected to the conductor, and the other side to ground or the artificial ground plane. The radio waves reflected from the ground plane seem to come from an image antenna below the ground, with the monopole and its image forming a dipole, so the monopole antenna has a radiation pattern identical to the top half of the pattern of a similar dipole antenna. Since all of the equivalent dipole's radiation is concentrated in a half-space, the antenna has twice (3 dB increase of) the gain of a similar dipole, not considering losses in the ground plane. The most common form is the quarter- wave monopole which is one-quarter of a wavelength long and has a gain of 5.12 dBi when mounted over a ground plane. Monopoles have an omnidirectional radiation pattern, so they are used for broad coverage of an area, and have vertical polarization. The ground waves used for broadcasting at low frequencies must be vertically polarized, so large vertical monopole antennas are used for broadcasting in the MF, LF, and VLF bands. Small monopoles are used as nondirectional antennas on portable radios in the HF, VHF, and UHF bands. * Whip ‚Äì Type of antenna used on mobile and portable radios in the VHF and UHF bands such as boom boxes, consists of a flexible rod, often made of telescoping segments. * Rubber ducky ‚Äì Most common antenna used on portable two-way radios and cordless phones due to its compactness, consists of an electrically short wire helix. The helix adds inductance to cancel the capacitive reactance of the short radiator, making it resonant. Very low gain. * Ground plane ‚Äì a whip antenna with several rods extending horizontally from base of whip attached to the ground side of the feedline. Since whips are mounted above ground, the horizontal rods form an artificial ground plane under the antenna to increase its gain. Used as base station antennas for land mobile radio systems such as police, ambulance and taxi dispatchers. * Mast radiator ‚Äì A radio tower in which the tower structure itself serves as the antenna. Common form of transmitting antenna for AM radio stations and other MF and LF transmitters. At its base the tower is usually, but not necessarily, mounted on a ceramic insulator to isolate it from the ground. * Folded unipole antenna ‚Äì is a modified mast antenna, usually grounded at its base, augmented by one or several parallel wires called \\"skirt wires\\" that attach to the mast part-way up the antenna. The skirt wires can attach at any height between part-way up and the top of the mast. One or more of the skirt wires is fed with the signal, similar to a gamma match. The number and relative thickness of the mast and the skirt wires adjusts the impedance magnitude at the feedpoint. Further, the fed wire(s) and the mast form a vertically aligned loop which inductively loads the antenna, with the inductance controlled by the height of the attachment point. * T and inverted L ‚Äì Consist of a long horizontal wire suspended between two towers with insulators, with a vertical wire hanging down from it, attached to a feedline to the receiver or transmitter. Used on LF and VLF bands. The vertical wire serves as the radiator. Since at these frequencies the vertical wire is electrically short, much shorter than a quarter wavelength, the horizontal wire(s) serve as a capacitive \\"hat\\" to increase the current in the vertical radiator, increasing the gain. Very narrow bandwidth, requires loading coil to tune out any remaining capacitive reactance. Requires low resistance ground. * Inverted F ‚Äì Combines the advantages of the compactness of inverted-L antenna, and the good matching of the F-type antenna. The antenna is grounded at the base and fed at some intermediate point. The position of the feed point determines the antenna impedance. Thus, matching can be achieved without the need for a separate matching network. * Umbrella ‚Äì Very large wire transmitting antennas used on VLF bands. Consists of a central mast radiator tower attached at the top to multiple wires extending out radially from the mast to ground, like a tent or umbrella, insulated at the ends. Extremely narrow bandwidth, requires large loading coil and low resistance counterpoise ground. Used for long range military communications.

Wire dipoles suspended between towers File:Superturnstile Tx Muehlacker.JPGFour-bay batwing television broadcasting antenna, Germany. Array antennas consist of multiple simple antennas working together as a single compound antenna. Broadside arrays consist of multiple identical driven elements, usually dipoles, fed in phase, radiating a beam perpendicular to the antenna plane. Endfire arrays are fed out-of-phase, with the phase difference corresponding to the distance between them; they radiate within the antenna plane. Parasitic arrays consist of multiple antennas, usually dipoles, with one driven element and the rest parasitic elements, which radiate a beam along the line of the antennas. * Collinear ‚Äì Consist of a number of dipoles in a vertical line. It is a high-gain omnidirectional antenna, meaning more of the power is radiated in horizontal directions and less wasted radiating up into the sky or down onto the ground. Gain of 8‚Äì10 dBi. Used as base station antennas for land mobile radio systems such as police, fire, ambulance, and taxi dispatchers, and sector antennas for cellular base stations. * Yagi‚ÄìUda ‚Äì One of the most common directional antennas at HF, VHF, and UHF frequencies. Consists of multiple half-wave dipole elements in a line, with a single driven element and multiple parasitic elements which serve to create a uni-directional or beam antenna. These typically have gains between 10‚Äì20 dBi depending on the number of elements used, and are very narrow band (with a usable bandwidth of only a few percent) though there are derivative designs which relax this limitation. Used for rooftop television antennas, point-to-point communication links, and long distance shortwave communication using skywave (\\"skip\\") reflection from the ionosphere. * Log-periodic dipole array ‚Äì Often confused with the Yagi-Uda, this consists of many dipole elements along a boom with gradually increasing lengths, all connected to the transmission line with alternating polarity. It is a directional antenna with a wide bandwidth. This makes it ideal for use as a rooftop television antenna, although its gain is much less than a Yagi of comparable size. * Reflective array ‚Äì Multiple dipoles in a two-dimensional array mounted in front of a flat reflecting screen. Used for radar and UHF television transmitting and receiving antennas. * Phased array ‚Äì A high gain antenna used at UHF and microwave frequencies which is electronically steerable. It consists of multiple dipoles in a two-dimensional array, each fed through an electronic phase shifter, with the phase shifters controlled by a computer control system. The beam can be instantly pointed in any direction over a wide angle in front of the antenna. Used for military radar and jamming systems. * Curtain array ‚Äì Large directional wire transmitting antenna used at HF by shortwave broadcasting stations. It consists of a vertical rectangular array of wire dipoles suspended in front of a flat reflector screen consisting of a vertical \\"curtain\\" of parallel wires, all supported between two metal towers. It radiates a horizontal beam of radio waves into the sky above the horizon, which is reflected by the ionosphere to Earth beyond the horizon. * Half-square antenna ‚Äì A pair of ground-isolated, quarter-wave vertical monopoles, whose tops are connected by a line one half-wavelength long. The verticals are the radiators and function as a two-element array, similar to the bobtail curtain. The structure is shaped like the Greek letter Œ† (not to be confused with the Half-Loop antenna described below). The top-to-top connecting wire serves as a phased feedline, or an auxiliary feed, which puts the point of maximum current at the top of each monopole. Neither monopole element has a wire connection to the ground beneath it. Top-fed monopoles produce a strong signal low to the horizon, as opposed to an ordinary bottom- fed monopoles. The feedpoint for the combined system may be placed at any of several locations. * Batwing or superturnstile ‚Äì A specialized antenna used in television broadcasting consisting of perpendicular pairs of dipoles with radiators resembling bat wings. Multiple batwing antennas are stacked vertically on a mast to make VHF television broadcast antennas. Omnidirectional radiation pattern with high gain in horizontal directions. The batwing shape gives them wide bandwidth. * Microstrip ‚Äì an array of patch antennas on a substrate fed by microstrip feedlines. Microwave antenna that can achieve large gains in compact space. Ease of fabrication by PCB techniques have made them popular in modern wireless devices. Beamwidth and polarization can be actively reconfigurable. Loop Loop antennas consist of a loop (or coil) of wire. Loop antennas interact directly with the magnetic field of the radio wave, rather than its electric field, making them relatively insensitive to electrical noise within about a quarter-wavelength of the antenna. There are essentially two broad categories of loop antennas: large loops (or full-wave loops) and small loops. Only one design, a \\"halo\\" antenna, that is usually called a loop does not fit into either the large or small loop categories. =Large loops= Full loops have the highest radiation resistance, and hence the highest efficiency of all antennas: Their radiation resistances are several hundreds of Ohms, whereas dipoles and monopoles are tens of Ohms, and small loops are a few ohms, or even fractions of an Ohm. * Large loops ‚Äì Loops with perimeter of a full wavelength, two wavelengths, or any whole-number multiple of a full-wavelength, are naturally resonant and act somewhat similarly to the full-wave or multi-wave dipole. When it is necessary to distinguish them from small loops, they are called \\"full-wave\\" loops.The popular \\"quad\\" antenna design is necessarily a full-wave loop, so no other distinction is needed. * Quad ‚Äì Although \\"quad\\" can refer to a single quadrilateral-shaped loop, the term usually refers to two or more loops stacked side by side; at first glance, quads resemble a box kite frame. One loop in the quad is connected to the feedline and functions as the driver for the antenna and is the main signal radiator, while the others are parasitic element that act as resonators, increasing the gain. Quad antennas function analogously to Yagi-Uda antennas made with loops, and are similarly used as a directional antennas on the HF bands for shortwave communication. They are sometimes preferred for longer wavelengths because (if square) they are half as wide as a Yagi. * Half-loop ‚Äì A ground-mounted upper half of a full- wavelength loop antenna (not to be confused with a half-square array). The full loop is cut at two opposite points along its perimeter, and the lower half is omitted. It is shaped like the Greek letter Œ† or an upside-down capital letter U, and is the loop antenna analog of a ground-mounted monopole antenna. Like a vertical monopole, the missing lower half of the antenna is replaced by its ground-plane image. If shaped like a half of a square, a half- loop can operate either as a loop antenna or, on its first harmonic, as a dipole antenna whose ends have been bent over and grounded, depending on the form and location of the feed-point. =In between= * Halo antennas ‚Äì Loops that are exactly one half-wavelength in perimeter ‚Äì with a small gap cut in the loop ‚Äì are called \\"halo antennas\\" and are intermediate in form and function between small and large loops. They are often described as a half- wavelength dipole that has been folded into a circle, rather than being a true loop antenna. =Small loops= The great disadvantage of any small antenna, including small loops, is a very small radiation resistance ‚Äì typically much smaller than the loss resistance, making small loops very inefficient for transmitting. However, small loops are very effective receiving antennas, especially at low frequencies, where all feasible antennas are \\"small\\" compared to a wavelength. * Small loops ‚Äì If the loop perimeter is smaller than a half-wavelength, the loop must be modified in some way to make it resonant, if resonance is necessary. Small loops are called \\"magnetic loops\\", and if modified for resonance they are also called \\"tuned loops\\". Their directionality and radiation efficiency is drastically different from full- wave loops. Small loops are widely used as compact direction finding antennas. * Ferrite (loopstick) ‚Äì Loopstick antennas are omnidirectional around their axes, and are premier examples of small loop antennas. They are the magnetic analogue of the short dipole antenna. These are used as the receiving antenna in most consumer AM radios operating in the medium wave broadcast band (and lower frequencies).A notable exception are car radios, which require an antenna outside the metal car chassis which blocks AM and longer-wave reception. Wire is coiled around a ferrite core which greatly increases the coil's inductance and its effective signal-capturing area. The radiation pattern is maximum at directions perpendicular to the ferrite rod. The null direction of ferrite core antennas are bi-directional and much sharper than the maximal directionality. This often makes the direction of the null more useful for locating a signal source than the direction of the strongest signal. The null direction of small loops can also be exploited to reject unwanted signals from an interfering station or noise source. Conical * biconical antenna is a dipole-like antenna made of two cones, oriented along the same axis and oriented tip-to-tip. * Butterfly antenna is a two-dimesional (flat) biconical antenna. A butterfly antenna * discone antenna is half of a biconical with a flat disc mounted above the cone Discone antenna dimensions Aperture File:Canberra Deep Dish Communications Complex - GPN-2000-000502.jpgNASA Cassegrain parabolic spacecraft communication antenna, Australia.

File:BocinaLenteDiel√©ctrica.JPGDielectric lens antenna used in millimeter wave radio telescope Aperture antennas are the main type of directional antennas used at microwave frequencies and above. They consist of a small dipole or loop feed antenna inside a three-dimensional guiding structure large compared to a wavelength, with an aperture to emit the radio waves. Since the antenna structure itself is nonresonant they can be used over a wide frequency range by replacing or tuning the feed antenna. * Parabolic ‚Äì The most widely used high gain antenna at microwave frequencies and above. Consists of a dish-shaped metal parabolic reflector with a feed antenna at the focus. It can have some of the highest gains of any antenna type, up to 60 dBi, but the dish must be large compared to a wavelength. Used for radar antennas, point-to-point data links, satellite communication, and radio telescopes * Horn ‚Äì a simple antenna with moderate gain of 15 to 25 dBi that consists of a flaring metal horn attached to a waveguide. Used for applications such as radar guns, radiometers and as feed antennas for parabolic dishes. * Slot ‚Äì consists of a waveguide with one or more slots cut in it to emit the microwaves. Linear slot antennas emit narrow fan-shaped beams. Used as UHF broadcast antennas and marine radar antennas. * Lens ‚Äì a lens antenna consists of layer of dielectric or a metal screen or multiple waveguide structure of varying thickness in front of a feed antenna, which acts as a lens which refracts the radio waves, focusing them on the feed antenna. * Dielectric resonator ‚Äì consists of small ball or puck-shaped piece of dielectric material excited by aperture in waveguide Used at millimeter wave frequencies Traveling wave File:Beverage antenna animation 408x212x15ms.gifAnimation showing a Beverage antenna . File:Moosbrunn Quadrantantennen.JPGQuadrant antenna, similar to rhombic, at an Austrian shortwave broadcast station. Radiates horizontal beam at 5-9 MHz, 100 kW File:Traqueur acquisition.JPGArray of four axial-mode helical antennas used for satellite tracking, France Unlike the above antennas, traveling-wave antennas are not resonant so they have inherently broad bandwidth. They are typically wire antennas that are multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear polarization (except for the helical antenna). Unidirectional traveling-wave antennas are terminated by a resistor at one end equal to the antenna's characteristic resistance, to absorb the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas. * Beverage ‚Äì Simplest unidirectional traveling-wave antenna. Consists of a straight wire one to several wavelengths long, suspended near the ground, connected to the receiver at one end and terminated by a resistor equal to its characteristic impedance, 400‚Äì800 Œ© at the other end. Its radiation pattern has a main lobe at a shallow angle in the sky off the terminated end. It is used for reception of skywaves reflected off the ionosphere in long distance \\"skip\\" shortwave communication. * Rhombic ‚Äì Consists of four equal wire sections shaped like a rhombus. It is fed by a balanced feedline at one of the acute corners, and the two sides are connected to a resistor equal to the characteristic resistance of the antenna at the other. It has a main lobe in a horizontal direction off the terminated end of the rhombus. Used for skywave communication on shortwave bands. * Leaky wave ‚Äì Microwave antennas consisting of a waveguide or coaxial cable with a slot or apertures cut in it so it radiates continuously along its length. * Helical (axial mode) ‚Äì Consists of a wire in the shape of a helix mounted above a reflecting screen. It radiates circularly polarized waves in a beam off the end, with a typical gain of 15 dBi. It is used at VHF and UHF frequencies where antenna sizes are feasible. Often used for satellite communication, which uses circular polarization because it is insensitive to the relative rotation on the beam axis. When a helical antenna has about 10 turns or more, each turn a full wavelength, then it is a form of traveling- wave antenna. If it only has a few turns (or just one) and the turns' totaled circumference is one or a few wavelengths, then it is some variety of a large loop antenna. When the totaled circumference of all the turns taken together is less than one wavelength, then the helix is a continuously-loaded monopole, called a \\"rubber ducky antenna\\", or a \\"Slinky\\" antenna, or a \\"broomstick\\" antenna. Other antenna types A typical random wire antenna for shortwave reception, strung between two buildings. The following antenna, called \\"the odd bit of wire\\" by Moxon (1982), doesn't easily fit into any of the categories above. * Random wire ‚Äì This describes the typical antenna used to receive shortwave radio, consisting of a random length of wire either strung outdoors between supports or indoors in a zigzag pattern along walls, connected to the receiver at one end. The antenna typically will have complex radiation patterns with several lobes at angles to the wire, in different directions for each fold in the antenna. Random wire antennas typically are categorized as folded monopole antennas if their lengths are two wavelengths or less, but operate similarly to traveling-wave antennas when they are laid out in a straight line several wavelengths long.

Written by Ashvin Kumar, the film stars Zara Webb, Ashvin Kumar, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Anshuman Jha, Natasha Mago. Film released on 5 April 2019.  Synopsis  A tender fondness blossoms between innocent teens Noor (16) and Majid (16) who get lost searching for their fathers who ‚Äòdisappeared‚Äô decades ago. They spend the night in the woods and wake to find themselves in a graveyard having unwittingly uncovered the hidden secrets of the lost fathers of Kashmir.  Plot  This is a coming-of-age film about friendship, hope and peace told through the innocent eyes of Noor (16), a smart-talking, selfie- obsessed British-Kashmiri teenager, who finds herself in a small village in Kashmir to meet her grandparents (Kulbhushan Kharbanda & Soni Razdan) who she has never met. A tender and innocent friendship blossoms between her and a local village boy, Majid (16). She discovers that her dad and Majid‚Äôs father were inseparable friends too, as young men. As an opaque story of that friendship unravels, so does Noor‚Äôs curiosity about her father, as she stumbles on a series of long-held secrets. Finally, she finds out that her father passed away under strange circumstances. What follows is a quest for answers in which a reluctant Majid finds himself taking her on a journey. They get lost in a dense jungle as they search for the last traces of their fathers without realising that the day has ended. As night falls, they light a bonfire, safe in the silent company of each other and fall asleep. When they wake up, the teenagers are found by soldiers on patrol. Majid, initially safe from detection, could easily have escaped but he gives up his own safety to come to Noor‚Äôs rescue. In a heartbreaking twist, Noor is soon released because she is a foreigner with a British passport but Majid is not. The question now is what, if anything, will Noor do to secure Majid‚Äôs release?  Context  Ashvin Kumar‚Äôs third film on Kashmir, after Inshallah, Football & Inshallah, Kashmir is a coming-of-age story about innocence and the exuberance of being young and hopeful. Based on hundreds of true stories, this tender storm of first-love and heart-break tells a deeper story of truth, humanity and compassion; of a tragic land and its much misunderstood, beautiful people.  Cast  * Zara Webb as Noor * Shivam Raina as Majid * Ashvin Kumar as Arshid * Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Abdul Rashid * Maya Sarao as Parvena * Soni Razdan as Halima * Anshuman Jha as Army major * Natasha Mago as Zainab  Music  The music of the film was composed by Loic Dury and Christophe (disco) Mink, two French composers who heard dozens of versions of the Cholhama Roshay song and decided to make it their inspiration. The music of the film included instruments rarely heard in a sound track like the crystal bashe ‚Äì an instrument that takes up an entire room to play. The composers never actually met Ali Safuddin. Nor did they ask him to re perform the title track in a studio. They took the same version as he recorded on YouTube sitting by the Dal Lake and added their own magic underneath. When Ali heard it for the first time at the screening of the film he was floored.  Struggles  The struggles the film faced were not only with the internal conflicts of an artist and those of film production problems but the external conflicts of censorship made it a 5 year long bruising campaign of sorts. Part funded by a very successful campaign on Kickstarter which also helped gather private sources, producers faced the first in a series of several setbacks when on the 23rd of June Brexit happened and shaved off 10% of the funds raised with so much difficulty. Just as the crew was gathering to shoot outside Srinagar, in June 2016, Burhan Wani, the militant who had become a social media sensation among the Kashmiri youth, was killed and there was a six month shutdown in the valley. Two weeks before the shoot, three of the main actors of the film dropped out for various reasons sending the team who were as it is unprepared, scrambling around casting directors to look for replacements. The shoot began on the 07th November, 2016 and on the 08th of November the Indian Rupee was demonetised. When the shoot resumed, the location was changed to Bhaderwah, Kishtwar District, the film was given a different name, the crew had to shoot the film in an impossibly short schedule, in a bitterly cold Himalayan winter in a remote part of the world‚Äîno heating, electricity and 14-hour work-days. The budget already diminished by Brexit and Demonitisation was made for the long days of summer. It was simply insufficient for the shorter days of winter. The crew needed more days of shoot but funds were running thin. Posts the shoot while the film was being edited, producers got down to raising money again, and prepared another schedule in July 2017. = Censorship Issues = An eight month battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) began in July 2018. After the first viewing that took place in October, CBFC passed the film with an 'A' certificate. The makers had then disagreed with the apex body and challenged their decision. They then went to the FCAT in November. Subsequently, two hearings were organised, one in December and another one in January. All this while, support from the film fraternity did not slow down. Pritish Nandy and actress Swara Bhaskar lent support to the film. Also, expressing her disappointment in the matter, actress Alia Bhatt had written, ‚ÄúWas soo looking forward to mom's @nofathers_movie #nofathersinkashmir!! @Soni_Razdan @ashvinkumar & team worked super hard for this honest teens love story in Kashmir. Really hope the CBFC would #lifttheban. It‚Äôs a film about empathy & compassion... let‚Äôs give love a chance!‚Äù  Critical response  No Fathers in Kashmir received glowing reviews from critics and audiences alike making it one of the best reviewed films of 2019. Udita Jhunjhunwala wrote on Scroll.in that Ashvin Kumar offered a \\"sobering view of a situation that he seasons with hope\\". A powerful drama that terrifically encapsulates the robbed childhoods and broken dreams of Kashmiri adolescents, Kumar uses a British-Kashmiri teenage girl to propel his narrative that dwells deep into the darkest, most horrific corners of the valley, writes, Ankur Pathak in Huffingtonpost.in Utkarsh Mishra of Rediff.com gave 4.5 stars out of 5, writing, \\"can be watched again and again to understand each and every aspect of it\\". Samrudhi Ghosh of IndiaToday wrote, \\"No Fathers In Kashmir leaves you thinking of the thousands of disappeared fathers, sons and brothers long after you leave the theatre\\". Paulomi Das of Arre thinks that film is a tender portrait of first love in the time of the Kashmir crisis. Saibal Chaterjee of NDTV gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and commented, \\"the impact of the quality writing, the steady cinematography and the sharp editing is enhanced significantly by a cast of actors who strike the right notes all the way.\\" Chetna Kapoor of Republic World rated the film 4 out of 5, wrote, \\"Zara Webb And Shivam Raina shine bright in this dark tale of a paradise at war\\". Sreeparna Sengupta of Times of India rated it 3.5 stars out of 5. Suguna Sundaram of Cineblitz gave it 4 stars out of 5, applauded the performances and direction, and concluded \\"This simply told tale touches one deep inside, where it matters.

The method also seeks to prevent or reduce the effects of type 2 diabetes, technically known as diabetes mellitus type 2. The method was developed by Bradley Field Bale and Amy Doneen.  Description  Similar to other protocols, the method tests for cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and diabetes, as well as factors not included in other current protocols, including systemic inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, insulin resistance, elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), and genetic risks, to identify potential root causes of arterial plaque. Testing for plaque includes a carotid intima-media thickness test, (CIMT), which measures blood flow through the arteries and the thickness of the arteries. Physician Dr. Jeff Emery wrote that the test \\"allows us to identify if you are at future risk for a heart attack or stroke.\\" The American Heart Association has recommended CIMT as \\"a safe, non-invasive and relatively inexpensive means of assessing subclinical atherosclerosis. The technique is valid and reliable.\\" The method also uses the coronary artery calcium score (CAC), a measurement of the amount of calcium in the walls of the arteries that supply the heart muscle, using a coronary CT calcium scan of the heart. CAC has been shown to be an independent marker of risk for cardiac events, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality. The method uses urine and blood tests to check inflammatory markers, such as a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein test (CRP) measuring CRP, a protein in found in blood that indicates inflammation throughout the body. In 2017, results of the CANTOS trial demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapies reduce risk for heart attack, stroke, other cardiovascular events and cancer by up to 50%. The method ties results of this testing to considerations of lifestyle, diet, sleep disorders, stress levels, genetic factors, and dental care, and personalized treatment targets are set to reduce patients' cardiovascular risk. In some cases, these goals exceed those set by standard care. A common protocol for blood pressure indicates that an adult male with a reading of 130/85 is not at risk for a heart attack if the patient is being treated for high blood pressure. However the American Heart Association and the BaleDoneen Method define safe levels as being below 120/80.  Effectiveness  In a retrospective study that analyzed data from patients who had received cardiovascular risk reduction treatments that included lipid- lowering medications, lifestyle modification, and additional therapies for those with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and other cardiovascular risks. The following outcomes were reported during the first year of treatment with the BaleDoneen Method, compared to baseline: 50% decrease in the size of carotid artery plaque deposits, 30% drop in triglycerides, 25% drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol, and 6% rise in HDL (good) cholesterol. A retrospective study of patients treated with the BaleDoneen Method, reported statistically significant reductions in CIMT measurements, plaque burden, fasting blood sugar, LDL cholesterol and inflammation over an eight-year period. Limitations of the study include lack of diversity in the study subjects, nearly all of whom were Caucasian, and lack of a comparison group. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to compare the effect of the method with standard treatment protocols.  Treatments  For the treatment of arterial disease, the method uses pharmaceuticals such as statins, baby aspirin (low dose aspirin), renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS inhibitors), and other drugs that are common tools for most physicians, as well as vitamins, supplements, lifestyle modification, and a diet based on the patient's DNA. The method also recommends significant attention to dental care to improve heart and circulatory system health, including brushing and flossing teeth twice a day.

He served as director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) from 1988 to 1992, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego from 1977 to 2013, and as a vice president of the American Psychiatric Association. As NIMH director he helped develop the \\"Decade of the Brain\\", a research plan designed \\"to bring a precise and detailed understanding of all the elements of brain function within our own lifetime.\\"  Early life and education  Lewis Lund Judd was born in Los Angeles on February 10, 1930, the first of two sons of George Ezra Judd, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Emmeline (Lund) Judd, a homemaker. His younger brother, Howard, would later also become a doctor. After graduating from Harvard School, a Los Angeles boys‚Äô prep school (now part of the coeducational Harvard-Westlake School), Judd entered the University of Utah, where he completed a degree in psychology in 1954. He studied medicine at George Washington University and at the University of California, Los Angeles, finishing his medical degree in 1958. He completed his internship and a residency in psychiatry at UCLA. After a stint in the military as base psychiatrist at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, NY, he joined the UCLA psychiatry faculty.  University of California, San Diego  In 1970, Arnold J. Mandell, the founding chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of California, San Diego, recruited Judd. The two built the department from the ground up, making it a leader in federal research funding. It was while consulting on an outside program to help adolescents with drug problems that Judd met a social worker, Patricia Hoffman, whom he married. Judd succeeded Mandell as department chair in 1977. In 1987, after helping to build the UC San Diego psychiatry department into a leader in biology psychiatry research, he was chosen to take over the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, MD, the world's largest source of funding for brain and behavior research. As head of the NIMH, he worked with President George H. W. Bush to put in place the Decade of the Brain, a designation given to the 1990s by Bush in a collaborative effort between the Library of Congress and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to \\"enhance public awareness of the benefits to be derived from brain research\\". In 1992, Judd returned to UC San Diego. He remained there for 36 years and became a recognizable public face in brain science. He also maintained a small clinical practice, specializing in treating severe depression.  Death and legacy  Judd died from cardiac arrest on December 16, 2018, in San Diego. He was 88 Besides his wife Patricia Judd, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCSD School of Medicine, he is survived by three daughters‚ÄîStephanie Judd, a psychologist; Catherine Judd, a professor of English at the University of Miami; and Allison Fee, an occupational therapist‚Äîand five grandchildren. Dr. Igor Grant, who is the current chair of the Department of Psychiatry at UCSD, said Judd's leadership laid the groundwork for today's BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative, begun under President Barack Obama. \\"We will celebrate his incredible contributions,\\" Grant said, \\"not just to our Department, School, and University, but to the field of Mental Health internationally.\\" References Category:1930 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American neuroscientists Category:American psychiatrists Category:University of California, San Diego faculty ","title":"Lewis Judd"},{"id":"59701156","text":"Mal Paso is a barrio in the municipality of Aguada, Puerto Rico.

He also was the acting United States National Security Advisor for eight days in September 2019 between John Bolton and Robert C. O'Brien. Early life and education Kupperman graduated from Waukegan High School in 1968, where he played varsity baseball; his parents owned a paint factory in Waukegan. Kupperman earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Purdue University in 1972. He received a master's degree in international relations from the University of British Columbia in 1973. His master's thesis was entitled Strategy, Technology and the Making of United States Strategic Doctrines 1945‚Äì1972. Kupperman completed a doctorate in strategic studies at the University of Southern California in 1980. His doctoral thesis was entitled The SALT II Debate, and supervised by William Van Cleave. Career President Ronald Reagan in 1987 From 1978 to 1980, Kupperman was the senior defense analyst for the Committee on the Present Danger. In 1980, Kupperman was a foreign policy adviser to Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. After Reagan was elected, Kupperman joined the Reagan administration. He was executive assistant to the acting administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, beginning in December 1985, and then the Executive Director of the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, before becoming the executive assistant to the director of the Office of Personnel Management. In July 1986 he became special assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of Administration. In 1991, Kupperman became the president and chief executive of Xsirius Superconductivity, a small Arlington, Virginia company developing commercial applications for high-temperature superconductivity technology. Kupperman also worked at two defense contractors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing; he was the vice president for business development for missile defense systems for Boeing and the vice president of Washington Space Operations for Lockheed Martin Corporation. He retired from Boeing in July 2006, after six years. From 2001 to 2010, Kupperman was on the board of directors for the Center for Security Policy. In late 2014, he was the treasurer of the Bolton for New Hampshire PAC. In April 2018, after Bolton was chosen to be the national security advisor, Kupperman took a temporary leadership post on the National Security Council. In January 2019, he became the deputy national security advisor, replacing Mira Ricardel, who had left that position in mid-November 2018. On September 10, 2019, when John Bolton departed from his position of United States national security advisor, Kupperman was made acting United States national security advisor. The Council on American Islamic Relations said that it was \\"appalled\\" by Kupperman's appointment because of the Center for Security Policy's record of anti-Islam statements. With the appointment of Robert O'Brien on September 18, he was removed as acting national security advisor; he was replaced as deputy national security advisor four days later, on September 22, with Matt Pottinger. = Trump-Ukraine scandal = Kupperman was on the July 25th call when President Trump allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Kupperman was scheduled to testify on October 28, 2019, before three House committees handling the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump with respect to the Trump-Ukraine scandal. The Trump administration, through White House counsel Pat Cipollone, directed Kupperman in writing not to comply with the House subpoena claiming \\"constitutional immunity\\" would protect him. Subsequently, Kupperman filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to decide whether or not he must comply with the House subpoena or the Trump Administration's request to not testify. Kupperman's lawyer argued that he is faced with \\"irreconcilable commands\\" between the legislative and executive branches of government which can only be decided by the judicial branch. Due to the withdrawal of the House subpoena, on December 30, 2019, Judge Richard J. Leon dismissed Charles M. Kupperman v United States House of Representatives, et al., over the plaintiff's objections that he was still exposed to contempt, arrest, and fines from reissued subpoenas even though the House's lawyers had made promises not to do so.Savage, Charlie.

He started his career as a performing musician at age 13 and became a prominent figure in Norwegian accordion and popular music. Background Harald Henschien was born at the √òvre Hoen farm in √òvre Eiker in Buskerud county. He was the son of Theodor Catrinus Henschien (1855‚Äì1919) and Helga Hallstensdatter Gullingsrud (1872‚Äì1954) from the village of Bromma in the municipality of Nes. Career After several tours with various artists, Henschien came to H√∏nefoss in the municipality of Ringerike in 1924, where he settled and founded the Henschien Music Company (Henschiens musikkfirma). The company offered musical material (recorded music, music booklets, sheet music, etc.) and photography material. He also founded his own accordion factory at the site. Henschien started appearing on radio in 1925, and in 1928 he started the Henschien Trio (Henschiens Trio) together with the violinist Trygve Olai Johannessen and pianist Gunnar S√∏berg. The trio became known throughout Norway and made a number of recordings. Henschien himself recorded an accordion duet with Alf Hansen for the record label Odeon in the early 1920s. Altogether, Henschien produced over 100 recordings from 1922 to 1937, including for the companies Brunswick Records, Columbia Records, His Master's Voice, Musica, Polydor Records, and Telefunken. Later, Henschien also made a name for himself in music education, including with a correspondence school that became popular throughout Scandinavia. In 1936, Henschien founded the Henschien Accordion Factory (Henschien Trekkspillfabrikk). The factory became the only one of its kind in Norway. However, due to strong competition from Italian manufacturers, it stopped operating in 1958. During its 22 years of operation, the factory produced 6,810 accordions, divided into twelve models. Several of the models were produced in such small numbers that today they are regarded as unique collectibles. The most popular model was the \\"Hensch,\\" and 3,948 of them were produced. The rarest was the \\"Henschien Special,\\" of which only 10 to 20 were produced. The magazine Rytme (Rhythm) was founded in 1941, during the Second World War, with a hiatus in 1943 and 1944 because of a lack of paper. Today, it is considered an important source of early popular music because it contained not only material about accordion music, but also about popular music at that time. Rytme was published for over 20 years, and it was edited by Leif Berg (1900‚Äì1955), who was succeeded by Arnt Haugen (1928‚Äì1988) from 1955 to 1962. By the time accordion production was discontinued in 1958, Henschien himself had been ill with Parkinson's disease for several years. He died in 1968, at the age of 66. The music store continued to be operated by his family (his daughter and her children) for many years after his death.

Her defense of her agricultural land against male relatives inspired her moniker \\"Pakistan's toughest woman\\" and also the 2017 film My Pure Land. Biography Nazo Dharejo's father Haji Khuda Buksh Khan Dharejo was a landlord from a Zamindar family that owned agricultural land in Pakistan's Sindh Province. Nazo Dharejo is his oldest daughter with his second wife Waderi Jamzadi. She was born in a haveli in Qazi Ahmed. Haji Khuda Baksh hired tutors for his daughters, so Nazo Dharejo learned Urdu and English in addition to Sindhi. She then earned her Bachelor of Arts in economics at Sindh University. Haji Khuda Baksh taught his daughters as well as his son to use firearms in case they might need to defend the family's land. The father of Haji Khuda Baksh (Nazo Dharejo's grandfather) had four wives and several other sons. The grandfather's death created strong disputes about inheritance. After Nazo Dharejo's only brother was killed, and her father was jailed, some male relatives tried to take over the land where Nazo Dharejo was living with her mother and sisters. Instead of yielding the land, Nazo Dharejo with her sisters and her husband Zulfiqar Dharejo (they are first cousins) defended themselves by shooting at their attackers. Then Nazo Dharejo's male relatives recruited 200 dacoits to attack the farm at night, in August 2005. Nazo Dharejo led the armed defense against them, firing her Kalashnikov rifle when they tried to approach the buildings. According to the Singapore Straits Times: \\"The gunfight which followed earned her the moniker 'Pakistan's toughest woman'\\". In legal battles that followed these armed attacks, Dharejo and her family won half a million rupees (S$6,459) in compensation. Nazo Dharejo has been active in politics with the PML-N party under the name Mukhtiar Nazo Dharejo. In 2013, she was listed as one of the women on their reserved seats for Sindh. My Pure Land After reading a 2012 newspaper article titled \\"Meet Nazo Dharejo: The toughest woman in Sindh,\\" British-Pakistani filmmaker Sarmad Masud wanted to make a movie about her defense of her family's land. The movie was filmed in Urdu rather than Sindhi. Sindhi classical dancer Suhaee Abro played the lead role of Nazo Dharejo.

Early Life Jean-Louis Palladin was born on May 7, 1946, in the small town of Condom, Gers in southwestern France. Palladin attended culinary school in Toulouse and then worked in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant in Condom. The owner of the restaurant recognized Palladin's talent, and together they created a new restaurant, La Table des Cordeliers, where Palladin, at 28 years of age, would become the youngest chef in France to earn two Michelin stars. Jean-Louis at the Watergate In 1979, Palladin was recruited to the United States to open a restaurant at the Watergate hotel. Jean-Louis at the Watergate soon became the \\"in\\" place for Washington's politicians and socialites. Its reputation blossomed during the Ronald Reagan administration, when many of President Reagan's associates from California moved into apartments at the Watergate and made Jean-Louis their regular meeting place. President Reagan celebrated his 70th birthday at Jean- Louis at an intimate party that included actor Jimmy Stewart. Palladin sought to incorporate American ingredients on his menu: \\"The challenge of cooking in America,\\" he said in 1987, \\"is to discover the newest and best products from the different states -- baby eels and lamprey from Maine, fresh snails from Oregon, blowfish from the Carolinas and California oysters -- and then to learn how to integrate them into your cuisine.\\" Jean-Louis became a destination for other prominent French and American chefs, such as Julia Child, Thomas Keller, and Daniel Boulud. √âric Ripert worked under Palladin at the Watergate for a few years. For his cooking at the Watergate, Palladin won two James Beard Awards, including Outstanding Chef of 1993. The restaurant never made a significant profit, however, due to its small size and expensive ingredients - Jean-Louis closed on June 15, 1996. Later Career In 1993, Palladin opened a second restaurant in Washington, Pesce in Dupont Circle. In 1997, he opened a restaurant in Las Vegas, Napa at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. In 1999, he allowed his name to be used at Palladin, a restaurant in the Time Hotel in New York City. Death and Legacy Palladin died of lung cancer on November 25, 2001 at his home in McLean, Virginia. He was survived by two children, Olivier and Verveine Palladin. Palladin's colleagues and friends created a foundation in his name in 2002, which was subsumed under the James Beard Foundation in 2009. The Foundation administers the Jean-Louis Palladin Professional Work/Study Initiative in Palladin's honor.

Most of them are stars, network celebrities and industry celebrities, even an enterprise. Fan economy is a kind of operation mode to obtain the economic and social benefits through promoting the users‚Äô loyalty to optimize the effect of word of mouth marketing. The core is the emotional capital. Different from the traditional economy, consumers are leading role in fan economy. It is dominated by consumers to achieve the purposes of adding value idols and the brand. Background According to the research of American scholar Janet Staiger, fans in the broad sense can be traced back to Victorian times. Chinese fans began to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were called \\"style-conscious fans\\" at that time, unlike today's popular name \\"fans\\". In the contradictory process of being identified and preventing the cultural homogeneity of mainstream culture simultaneously , fans have formed their own unique style within their own circles. The fan culture is attracting more and more experts and scholars to study in the course of being suspected to be accepted. Scholar Yang Ling defined the triple degree for the \\"fan economy\\" : the emotional economy, the gift economy and the informal economy. She thinks the ultimate significance of \\"fans economy\\" in the field of culture is to break the centralized power structure, thus to give more power to consumers, to promote the diversity of cultural . She drew the theory of western fans research and made her reflections on the power relations between producers and consumers implied by the emotional economy. Yang ling believes that the ideas of fan economy that are popular domestic currently are relatively narrow. They defined fan economy as a kind of brand marketing narrowly in the new media era. They only treated fans who were increasing rapidly as the loyal customers and followers and ignored the autonomy of fan community autonomy. So it is necessary for us to pay more attention to the moral and legal issues, which are not involved in the interests in the economic system in the discussion of fan economy in the future. And to explore whether \\"fan economy\\" brought a more fair distribution of rights and interests. And whether the beneficiaries of fan economy are the fan community and fan culture or not. Scholars Li Wenming and Lv Fuyu believes the following aspects should be focused in terms of the development trend of fan economy: meeting the demand of fans and guiding the fans demand; managing to fans circle and fans community. The main strategies that comply with the development trend of fan economic can be divided into several aspects broadly: laying the solid foundation on fan economy; building distinctive fans brand; creating a new situation in electronic commerce of fans economy; maximizing the advantages of fan economy in community business. The essence of the fan economy is the brand community, which is a typical community thought. The Cause of Fan Economy A mature economic form must be have the steps of attracting users, keeping users and making the profits. As for traditional cultural products, the step of attracting and keeping users are based on product positioning and product quality. With the further refinement of the division of labor, the way of promoting cultural products has changed dramatically. Different from the form of product quality promotion in the past, the product quality and promotion are now pursued in different quality requirements in recent years. Fan economy was a new generation of operation and promotion. There were the concept of fan group at first, and then utilized the concept on promotion with the operation of modern cultural industry system. Fan economy was born. In fan economy, the core of fan group is not the fans promotion, but the production of promotional products. The quality of promotional products is not high enough to be best, but to meet the requirements of the rapid spread of production. It requires to let the user generate images in5 minutes and begin to spread. The Development Process of Fan Economy In the early 1990s, there was already a fan economy. British scholar Matt Hills observed, in the media industry transformation, the loyal fans became the most attractive consumers. If the television station wants to make a profit, there is no need to pursue the largest number of ordinary public, only to cater to a certain number of the most loyal audiences. After Chinese Economic Reform and open up, there has been real \\"fans\\" in China, such as Teresa Teng‚Äôs fans. But it is not commercial at that time, nor could it be called fan economy. In fact, the development speed of fan economy is consistent with the popularity of commercialization. The fans culture and fan economy has been developed in the late 1990s. The fans had stronger spontaneity, but lacked of planning and organization. In recent years, fans tend to be professional and organized. Fans industry has formed gradually. And that is what has happened in recent years with the development of various talent shows, such as the program \\"super girl\\" made by Hunan TV station in the past few years. Now fans is a special group of popular culture recipients on age of 15 to 31 years old. Female is majority. They put extraordinary enthusiasm on what they admire of specific individuals (stars, celebrities), program/work (film, television show, music works), group (pop group, the football team). Although they may be not have a very strong purchasing power, but the impulse to consume for their idols are shocking. The rise of social media is changing the communication method of mass media. In the new Internet context, the number of fans not only means that the influence also means economic value. What is the value of fans? Market research firm Syncapse said in a report recently, fans value of brands in Facebook has risen 30% since 2010. Currently, the average fans value of Facebook brands was worth $174; Yao Chen, a Chinese actress, is known as the \\"Weibo Queen\\". Her Weibo has been valued at $320 million by a valuation website. The growing fans group form the framework like Pyramid gradually. The upper level is occupied by leaders who master a lot of information about membership and idol. And the bottom is plenty of ordinary fans. Fan are special users. Their attention means the potential purchase behavior. As long as operating and managing well, the fan effect will be expanded gradually. The promotion force of a group of fans is even stronger than a professional team. They contain tremendous power to promote the industry.

He was a Hasanid, descendant of the ninth generation from Hasan ibn Ali. According to Ibn Khaldun, Ja'far came from Medina and conquered Mecca. He ordered the khutbah in the name of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz after the latter conquered Egypt in 969. Although the date Ja'far conquered Mecca is not known, Ibn Hazm writes that it was during the reign of the Ikhshidids in Egypt. Al-Fasi narrows it down to the years 356-358 AH (967-969), since Ikhshidid influence in the Hejaz waned after the death of Abu al-Misk Kafur. However, he does acknowledge that this is contradicted by some chronicles which indicate that Ja'far had Kafur's name pronounced in the khutbah. The sources provide different dates for the year in which Ja'far captured Mecca: the years 967, 968, 969, and the entire period 951‚Äì961 are mentioned. Ja'far founded a long line of Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca, which lasted until their overthrow by the Saudis in 1924. Ja'afar's line, the Ja'farid dynasty, ended with Shukr ibn Abi'l-Futuh in 1061.

Located near Big Bear Lake in California, it is open to children entering 3rd-10th grade, and incoming 12th graders are accepted as Madatz (counselors in training). All of the madrichimot (counselors) are young college students who take part in the Habonim Dror movement.  History  Habonim Dror (‚Äúthe builders of freedom‚Äù) is the result of a 1982 merger between two groups, Habonim (formed in London in 1929 before coming to North America six years later) and the youth Zionist movement Dror. Camp Gilboa has existed in the Los Angeles area since 1936. The camp operated on its own site in Idyllwild in the 1960s and 1970s, closed in 1982, then reopened in 1995 and operated at rented camp facilities east of Los Angeles until 2010. In 2011, Gilboa purchased a 40-acre campsite from the Wildlands Conservancy on Bluff Lake in the pine- forested mountains of Big Bear Valley, east of Los Angeles.  Summer Camp  The summer camp runs for 6 weeks. Campers have the option of staying for the full summer or for shorter sessions. Each session has approximately 140 campers. Young campers (entering 3rd or 4th grade) have the option of a 4-day camp experience called Nitzanimot (seedlings). As with other Habonim Dror camps, it instills the community-minded values of the kibbutz movement, but in an American Jewish context. Campers participate in traditional camp activities, such as hiking, kayaking, arts and crafts, and archery; there is also an emphasis is on \\"Israel, Hebrew, understanding current events and, most importantly, making campers personally responsible for the success of their Gilboa experience.\\" According to a 2013 study, 85% of Habonim Dror alumni (including Gilboa) have visited Israel multiple times, 70% have lived in Israel for 5 months or more, and 75% consider themselves politically progressive. HDNA camps attracted international attention with their transformation of many Hebrew words into gender neutral alternatives. For example, in traditional modern Hebrew, chanich means a male camper (plural is chanichim); chanichah means a female camper (plural is chanichot). At HDNA camps such as Gilboa, camper is the gender-neutral chanichol (plural is chanichimot).  Age Groups  As with other HDNA camps, Camp Gilboa is attended by children finishing grades 3 through 9, who are split into schavot (age groups). #Post 2nd grade-Nitzanimot (‚ÄúTaste of Gilboa‚Äù) #Post 3rd grade- Younger Goofimot #Post 4th grade-Amelimot (workers) #Post 5th grade- Sayarimot (patrollers) #Post 6th grade- Chotrimot (rowers) #Post 7th grade-Shomrimot (guards) #Post 8th grade-Bonimot (builders) #Post 9th grade-Bogrimot (graduates) #Post 10th grade- Machaneh Bonim Israel (MBI; Building Camp in Israel) or Kadima (forward)  Year-Round Programming  In addition to summer camps, HDNA has 16 chapters, called kenim (nests) in Canada and the US that operate during the school year. Three kenim are associated with Camp Gilboa, in Los Angeles, Berkeley, and San Diego. One program during the school year is the Bonimot Tzedek Leadership Development Program supporting teens, college students and young adults. Camp Gilboa teens help run youth programming in Los Angeles, such as a day camp for young students during the 2019 LAUSD teachers strike, and partner with community organizations in social action activities in both Northern and Southern California, including a donation drive for refugees, a seder for the downtown community, and interfaith vigils and interfaith programs.  Other Machanot (camps)  Habonim Dror has six active camps in North America, five of which were originally Habonim and one of which was originally Dror. All the other Dror Machanot have folded. The camps are called (and located in) Miriam (Vancouver, Canada), Tavor (MI), Gesher (Ontario, Canada), Moshava (MD), Galil (PA), and Gilboa (CA). Gesher was originally Dror.  Habonim Dror leadership programs  Post 10th graders from Gilboa participate with 10th graders from all 6 Habonim Dror North America camps in a summer program in Israel called Machaneh Bonim b'Israel (MBI) or in an alternative program in and around Detroit called Kadima. Post 11th graders engage in a summer leadership program called Madatz. This is a tochnit (program) dedicated to developing hadracha (leadership) and heightening the sense of kvutsah (group), similar to a CIT type experience and most of the graduates go on to become Madrachim (counselors) the following summers and youth leaders during the school year. Post 12th graders participate in the Habonim Dror year program in Israel, Workshop, which is the longest running North American gap-year program in Israel.  Facilities  Camp Gilboa bought its 40-acre camp on Bluff Lake in the San Bernardino National Forest, at an elevation of 7,600 feet near Big Bear Lake, in 2011 for $2.5 million from the Wildlands Conservancy, which had purchased and renovated the property five years earlier. The property includes a large dining hall, amphitheater, swimming pool, sports field, basketball court, and archery range. Bluff Lake is immediately adjacent to the camp and is available to campers for kayaking. The summer camp scenes from the Walt Disney film, The Parent Trap (1961 film) were filmed at the camp, then known as Bluff Lake Camp, owned at that time by the Pasadena YMCA. Dr. Dolittle 2, starring Eddie Murphy, was filmed at Bluff Lake.

Some Serbian historian and academician Djordje Spase Radojiƒçiƒá (1905-1970), who wrote about Serbian medieval history, believes that Nikodim was born in Prilepac, near Novo Brdo, now in Kosovo, the birthplace of Prince Lazar of Serbia, with whom he was related. This fact explains that Prince Lazar of Serbia chose Nikodim to participate in resolving the dispute between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople, as well as the fact that Lazar financed the construction of monasteries on both sides of the Danube. The late Romanian Metropolitan Nestor Vornicescu writes that Nicodemus was a Serb, and that he was fluent in Serbian, Church Slavonic and Greek. Romanian historian Alexandru Piru states that Nikodim Tismanski's first written works were in Serbian, and that the manuscripts were reworked and translated into Romanian by Hieromonk Stefan de la Tismana in 1839. He also mentions that Nikodim's father was a Greek from the town of Kostur and that Nikodim was a relative of Prince Lazar. Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga believes that Nikodim was an Aromanian originally, while in other papers he writes that Nikodim was a Serb and that he wrote in SerbianIlarion Ruvara»õ, Pop. Nicodim, Archiv f. sl. Philologie XI B.III H 1888, p. 355 Nikodim copied the four gospels, and in Romanian literature it is stated that they were originally written in Church Slavonic. Biography Raised in piety and honesty, early in his youth he met some traveling monks in Serbia from the Hilandar monastery, and went with them to Mount Athos, where he studied and labored patiently with perseverance. After the death of the then Abbot of Hilandar, the monks voted precocious Nikodim in his place. Nikodim was a friend of many famous people of that time, such as Prince Lazar of Serbia, Isaija the Monk, the Anonymous Athonite (biographer of the \\"Life of Isaiah\\", that is Isaija the Monk), Patriarch Euthymius of Tarnovo, Danilo II, Serbian Archbishop, and many others. There are sources that claim that he was related to Prince Lazar. Prince Lazar wanted to appoint him to a high spiritual function, but he rejected it and settled in the eastern parts of the country, near the city of Kladovo on the Danube. After hearing about his virtuous life, a group of monks gathered around him, and in that place -- Manastirica‚Äîthey established a monastery and a church named \\"Holy Trinity\\". This monastery is known as the Monastery of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" or Manastir Manastirica. In the newly established monastery, he introduced the hesychasm lifestyle that he learned on the Holy Mountain. The venerable Nikodim crossed the Danube River and settled in the northern Oltenia, where he erected the Vodice Monastery and dedicated it to Antony the Great, the founder of monasticism. When Prince Lazar sent a delegation to Constantinople to have a dialogue with Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople, he made sure that Nikodim went with Isaija the Monk who led the diplomatic mission. Upon returning from Constantinople, Nikodim erected the Tismana Monastery in Romania, dedicated to the Most Holy Virgin. In the course of time, Tismana Monastery benefited from the help of ruling princes Stefan Lazareviƒá, Radu I of Wallachia, Dan I of Wallachia, Mircea I of Wallachia and Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, to whom the pious Nicodemus was father confessor when he was king of Hungary (1385-1437). During his lifetime, Nikodim reconstructed the Visina Monastery as well as Prislop Monastery. Between 1399 and 1405 he retreated to Prislop Monastery in Transylvania and in 1406 he returned to Wallachia. Soon afterward, Saint Nicodemus met ruler prince Mircea the Old at Tismana, who called him ‚Äúmy prayerful father Nicodemus‚Äù, and in November he participated at Severin in the meeting with King Sigismund of Hungary (1385-1437), whom he impressed with his gift of working miracles. Saint Nicodemus corresponded with Euthymius, Patriarch of Tarnovo (1375-1393), for defending the true faith against the Bogomil heresy.http://orthochristian.com/99752.html Saint Nikodim died on 26 December 1406 and was buried in the narthex of the church of Tismana Monastery. His relics were kept there for a while, but later they were hidden in an unknown place because of the hostilities of the time. Only the forefinger of his right hand and his lead pectoral cross remained at Tismana.

The competition, widely recognized as a breeding ground for new talent is frequently attended by many industry professionals looking to find the next new sound.

Plot At the Hilltop, Lydia describes her backstory to Henry while both are in the community prison, unaware Daryl is listening in. As Lydia explains, Henry starts to become more compassionate towards Lydia, his own family having gone through similar hardships. Soon after, Daryl drags Henry away, fearing he may be becoming too close. Daryl continues to talk to her as well, trying to scope out the size of her group as Lydia claims that they may be coming to save her. He finds her arm covered in marks, which she says came from her mom. Daryl, who had been similarly beaten as a child, displays sympathy for Lydia's abuse, but she proves to still be uncooperative. He eventually walks off, claiming Lydia is Tara's problem, but Henry tries to convince him that Lydia is coming to face her past now. Henry mentions his surrogate mother, Carol, who had cut her hair short due to abuse from her first husband, Ed, has finally grown to feel safe enough to let it grow again now. Daryl agrees to work with Henry to try to help Lydia. Throughout the episode, Lydia's stories are told in flashbacks to the months after the walker outbreak. She and her parents have taken refuge in a Baltimore shelter with others. Lydia's father's sanity starts to unravel and believes the shelter is no longer safe; however, her mother takes more command, willing to kill a survivor sheltering with them who is having a panic attack as she considers him too weak to survive. That night, the survivor turns while Lydia is watching and her father runs to save her, but ends up getting bit. This only serves to harden Lydia's mother, eventually leading them to don the masks made from walkers to survive. In the present, Henry decides to let Lydia out of her cell for a while and discreetly shows her the safety and facilities the Hilltop has to offer. While Lydia has an opportunity to take a hammer and strike Henry with it to escape, the cries of a baby cause her to panic and flashback to her past, and she begs to be returned to her cell. She asks Henry to stay with her through the night. When morning comes, Daryl returns and Lydia states that she doesn't think her mother will be coming, and she was only trying to scope out information for her. Lydia then tells them that her story was a lie, her mother having told her that story to blame her father's death on Lydia. In reality, when the survivor had turned, it wasn't Lydia's father that was bitten, but instead another survivor; her mother took the opportunity to try to make their escape from the shelter, killing Lydia's father when he refused to leave with them. Lydia mentions where her mother and her people may be camped, but notes that they frequently move about. Meanwhile, Tara leads Magna, Yumiko, Connie, and Kelly to search for Alden and Luke, aware that they may encounter more people like Lydia that wear walker disguises. While they find the pair's horses, Tara declares it is too risky to stay out and orders the group back to the Hilltop. There, Magna's group debates going against orders to go back out and search for Luke, knowing that this will harm their chance to be accepted by the Hilltop. While they try to find the tracks again in the middle of the night, more walkers appear. Magna then suggests that they need to return, but Kelly states that they should find Luke; Connie opts to stay with Kelly. Unbeknownst to them, a Whisperer secretly watches them. Eventually, Magna and Yumiko return to the Hilltop by daylight. On a guard post, Yumiko apologizes to Tara for leaving. Tara accepts and tells Yumiko to talk to her next time, and informs her that the guards had seen them leave and that she had sent out a party to find and recover them, not wanting to see anyone else hurt. As they watch the guards bring Kelly and Connie back just outside the Hilltop gate, they spot a small group of Whisperers approaching the Hilltop. The guards then grab Kelly to get her safely inside, but are separated from Connie, who hides and takes shelter in the nearby cornfield. At the front of the gate, the Whisperers' leader, Lydia's mother now known as Alpha, appears unmasked and introduces herself. Alpha announces to the Hilltop residents that she wants only one thing from them: her daughter. Production Despite the death of his character in the eighth episode, Tom Payne (Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia) was credited in the episode, but does not appear. Samantha Morton (Alpha) joins the main cast as of this episode, as her name appears in the opening credits. In addition, the only credited main cast members that appear in this episode are Norman Reedus (Daryl Dixon) and Alanna Masterson (Tara Chambler).

It just feels very real, and what the audience is seeing is real, you know?

Jerry reveals that he and his wife Nabila are expecting a child. Eventually, Jesus and Tara arrive with the trade goods, and Jesus hands Ezekiel the charter of rights that Michonne had been developing for the Kingdom to hold onto; Ezekiel becomes enamored by the document and promises Carol that someday the community leaders will all sign it together. In the present, Ezekiel looks longingly at the charter in the Kingdom. At the Hilltop, Alpha demands that the community residents turn over her daughter Lydia. She explains that she has removed her walker mask to show them that she comes in peace and willing to overlook their trespass of her lands. Daryl decides to walk outside to talk to Alpha face to face; the two meet. He is initially dismissive of Alpha's demands as she and her human allies are few compared to the Hilltop forces. However, there are several more of Alpha's allies in wait beyond the tree lines, as well as a horde of walkers. Daryl tells Alpha that she can't have Lydia and informs her that he's ready to fight her people to ensure she doesn't get Lydia back, until he spots one of the Whisperers with a baby. Suddenly, a couple of Whisperers bring up a tied up Alden and Luke. Alpha then offers to trade both of them for her daughter; Daryl accepts. Inside the Hilltop, Daryl discovers that Henry and Lydia escaped. Addy tells him that she knows where they went; she and Enid head out to find them while Daryl stalls. As the standoff continues, the baby belonging to one of disguised women starts to cry, drawing the walkers. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating that she should leave the baby to die. Fearing for her life and not having any other choice, the baby's mother decides to abandon him as he continues to cry. Alden and Luke beg for Alpha to have the baby be spared, but Alpha refuses. The Hilltop guards bang the fence to attract the walkers away from the baby, but it doesn't work. Luke then frantically signs Connie, still hiding in the cornfield, to grab the baby. Connie then runs out of the cornfield and rushes to save the child. The Whisperers around her unsheathe blades as Connie escapes back into the cornfield and is helped back into the Hilltop by Daryl, Kelly, Tammy, and Earl. Soon after, Enid and Addy are able to track down Henry and Lydia to an abandoned house near the Hilltop, where Henry has provided Lydia a new set of clothes. Enid tries to convince Henry to not let the bad things change him and allow them to turn over Lydia, recalling how much death she herself has seen and the advice Carl had given her before he died. Lydia opts to leave on her own accord and is traded for Alden and Luke. Reunited, Lydia apologizes to her mother, but is smacked by Alpha across the face, ordering her to address her as \\"Alpha\\" like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave. At the Kingdom, with the fair approaching, Ezekiel leads a scouting party to a nearby town. His goal is to obtain a projection bulb from a movie theater to replace the one that is broken, but the theater is packed with walkers. Carol is initially against the plan, but is convinced by Ezekiel, who explains how this will be a positive improvement for the Kingdom. With minimal incident, they recover the bulb as well as one of the poster display cases, which Ezekiel wants to use so that he can frame the charter of rights once it is signed. Ezekiel's group then departs the theater and travels back to the Kingdom. The child recovered by Connie is turned over to Earl and Tammy to raise. That evening, Henry leaves a note and sneaks out of Hilltop to find Lydia. His departure is soon learned by Daryl, who finds out that Henry couldn't live with letting Lydia go.

Henry eventually catches up with Lydia and the Whisperers, and watches them from a close distance as they rest, but is found and grabbed by Beta, Alpha's second- in-command. Beta tosses Henry in front of Alpha, who questions the boy. Henry reveals that he came alone to get Lydia; Alpha decides that Henry is coming with them. On their way back to camp, Alpha asks Lydia why she didn't mention Henry. Lydia explains that he wasn't worth mentioning, but Alpha reminds her that he just risked his life to save her, so she must be lying. The Whisperers soon arrive back at their camp. Elsewhere, Daryl and Connie search for Henry in the woods, realizing that the Whisperers caught up with him. At the Whisperer's camp, Alpha taunts a secured Henry and explains to him why they disguise themselves as walkers, as the strong adapt while the weak die. Seconds later, two of her own, Sean and Helen, approach her and question why they gave up two people for her daughter. Alpha reminds them that she did it to get information, but Sean issues a challenge for her leadership role. In response, Alpha confirms that he has the right to challenge her position, but that she also has the right to defend it. Knowing that it was Helen that has been sowing seeds of discontent within the group, Alpha grabs Helen and decapitates her with a piece of wire. She then hands the head over to a sobbing Sean before fatally stabbing him in the stomach, as Henry looks on in horror. Privately, Alpha tells Beta a story about Lydia when she was three years old.

On a field, two Whisperers draw a herd to devour the couple's corpses as Daryl and Connie watch nearby. At night, Beta takes Henry to Alpha.

Suddenly, a small horde of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers, creating mass confusion. Alpha and the others quickly put on their masks so that they can try to lure the herd away. Moments later, Daryl and Connie arrive disguised as Whisperers to free and rescue Henry; they prepare to retreat. Daryl grabs Henry, who grabs Lydia, and together the four escape. In Alexandria, Michonne finds herself at odds with other members of the communities' council, particularly with Siddiq and Gabriel; she was concerned about not learning of Rosita and Eugene's mission to establish a radio tower. Gabriel points out to Michonne that she frequently overrides their decisions, specifically disallowing Alexandria to participate in the Kingdom's upcoming fair over concerns for their safety. Michonne later goes to check in on Negan, who has returned to his cell. Negan reveals he knows much of the situation due to gossip he hears outside his window as he tries to get Michonne to trust him. She returns to her home to chastise Judith, as she has been talking with Negan, but Judith insists that Negan has changed. Michonne refuses to believe that people can change until Judith points out that Michonne changed. While upset at Judith, Michonne takes this advice to heart and goes to tell Aaron that she will not overrule a vote to allow Alexandria to participate in the fair, even though she thinks it is still a bad idea. Meanwhile, Rosita's pregnancy with Siddiq's child continues. Both Gabriel and Eugene struggle with their own past romantic interests in Rosita. Eugene, evaluating his position logically, realizes that he likely has no chance, but encourages Gabriel to make efforts to continue to see Rosita, as it is clear the two love each other very much.

According to ECM, its release was \\"timely\\" as the 62nd International Festival of Contemporary Music of the 'Biennale di Venezia' honoured Keith Jarrett with its Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. Reception Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars and the review by Thom Jurek stated \\"The music found here is rangy and adventurous, commencing with the knotty, nearly 18-minute opening section that is one of the better showcases of the pianist's inventive delivery. Elements of classical technique and invention meet dissonant mechanics in a dazzling technical display ... La Fenice may be yet another Jarrett solo concert, but when he chases after it with this kind of energy, humor, passion, and emotion, an hour-and-a-half passes in what seems like a moment\\". Dave Gelly of The Observer commented that, \\"Jarrett has always favoured exhaustive documentation, but the intensity, variety, and astonishing technical command of these performances might well persuade devoted fans and intrigued improv enthusiasts alike of his view that these were landmark moments\\".Gelly, John (November 14, 2018) \\"Keith Jarrett: La Fenice review ‚Äì dazzling spontaneity from 2006\\". The Observer, January 18, 2019 In the Financial Times, Mike Hobart wrote \\"As on other solo recordings, this Jarrett performance contrasts modernist dissonance with delicate musings and references to folk music, the standard repertoire and the blues. Here, though, he builds his architectural structures on mere fragments of sound or turns slight themes into music of substance. The intense appreciation that fades out at the end of the set is merited ... The album doesn‚Äôt offer new insights into the pianist‚Äôs aesthetic, but each Jarrett performance is unique, and with the pianist near his fluent best it always engrosses\\". On All About Jazz, Karl Ackermann observed \\"As the greatest pianist of our time, the bar is inconsiderately high for Jarrett's work. One of a kind, he can't rationally be compared to his contemporaries, so with each addition to the catalog his output is judged relative to his own history. In that vein La Fenice falls short of later ECM albums ... The spontaneous improvisations are interesting but a bit sterile; the ballads are beautifully played as always, but predictable. At the end of the day, La Fenice is neither essential Jarrett nor an unworthy addition to his resume. It simply lacks the impact of much of his solo work\\". On the same site Mike Jurkovic said \\"Emotionally captivating as all his recordings ultimately are, La Fenice is mostly of the eight part suite that dominates the recording. ... But even with all its graceful moments of sheer creative joy and wonder, La Fenice isn't La Scala or any of the grander works that define and watermark Jarrett's sole and unique place in the art of solo piano ...

Releases =Train Sim World: CSX Heavy Haul= During beta release, the game was originally called Train Sim World: CSX Heavy Haul, which consisted of one playable route, Sand Patch Grade, based in the United States. =Train Sim World: Founders Edition= The second version was Founders Edition, which was available on Xbox One, containing Great Western Express. =Train Sim World= The third version, simply Train Sim World, was available on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, featuring three routes: Great Western Express, Rapid Transit, and Northeast Corridor: New York, as well as Sand Patch Grade for the PC version only. =Train Sim World 2020= The fourth version, Train Sim World 2020, is available for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4, featuring four routes: Great Western Express, Long Island Rail Road (Penn Station to Hicksville station), Main-Spessart Bahn (Aschaffenburg to Gem√ºnden), and Northern TransPennine (Manchester Victoria to Leeds route add-on), as well as Sand Patch Grade for PC only.

The announcement promoted new features, including the Livery Editor and Scenario Designer. Its release is planned to come with two new routes and locos: the ICE 3M and Talent 2 running from Cologne to Aachen, and the London Underground 1972 Stock, with the Bakerloo line. The game also comes with Sand Patch Grade route, featuring the following locomotives: AC4400CW, GP38-2, SD40-2. While the route is not new, it has been updated for PC and now also available on the confirmed console operating systems PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A feature called \\"Preserved Collection\\" which allows players to import their owned Train Sim World 2020 DLC into the game is shipped. This means players can continue using them without the need to pay for them again. DTG announced the game would be delayed on 16 July, with a rescheduled release date of 20 August, from the original 6 August. This was to allow them to make \\"Preserved Collection\\" add-ons compatible with their new Scenario Designer. They confirmed that content from this category will not be compatible with their new Livery Editor, due to a change in the way they develop trains. They also announced within one of their Community Q&A; livestreams that their Northeast Corridor route add-on, as well as their Amtrak SW1000R and CSX GP40-2 loco addons were not going to be part of the \\"Preserved Collection\\" due to technical issues. Dovetail Games unveiled their release Roadmap on 18 August, which presented their plans for future additions to the game, as well as the timeline for the additions \\"Preserved Collection\\" addons. Train Sim World 2 was released to the public on 20 August, for consoles at midnight local time, and on Steam for PC's at 17:00 UTC. Editing tools Train Sim World is confirmed to in the future have editing tools. In a September 2018 studio update, it was revealed that the tools, based on the Unreal Engine 4 editing tools, will be the same as that used by Dovetail Games to create content, allowing users to create routes, locomotives, wagons, coaches, scenarios and services. However, it will not be possible to edit existing routes released by Dovetail Games, at launch. It is planned for an open beta of the editing tools to be released. Dovetail Games also plans on creating a series of video tutorials for the editing tools. However, during a Train Sim World 2 Q&A; Livestream held on 11 June, it was confirmed that a public world-editor was NOT being worked on for the game at present, and that we should expect this status to remain indefinitely.
