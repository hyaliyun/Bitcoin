History  Between the 16th and 18th centuries, amateur street actors began to appear in Sibiu, performing in various improvised location. Around the middle of the 17th century, a wooden shed was erected in the Large Square of the city where the amateur performers could house their plays on a regular basis and some time after the plays were moved to a new location, near the western gate of the city. In 1769 all plays were moved to the house of Baron M√∂ringer, where they flourished and developed into more complex performances. In 1782 a group of actors led by Christoph Seipp arrived in Sibiu where, impressed by the atmosphere of the city, they settled for two years. The performances held by Seipp and the reaction of the public, convinced the local authorities that the city needed a theatre. The first location was set to be the Thick Tower. After two fires broke out, the last being in 1949, the authorities founded a permanent professional artistic institution in the building where the Apollo Cinema was functioning. First performance, held on 9 December 1949, was O scrisoare pierdutƒÉ under the direction of Radu Stanca. The German section was opened in 1956. The theatre is housed in the same building since then.http://www.cultura.sibiu.ro/institutii/tnrs - Romanian only Renamed in 2005, as Radu Stanca National Theatre, the institution became one of the leading Romanian theatres housing over a hundred plays.

It runs east from Targowa Street and is around one kilometre long. Considered one of the most interesting tourist destinations, it is famous for historical buildings, namely tenement houses that were built at the turn of the 20th century. ZƒÖbkowska Street History Before the First World War ZƒÖbkowska Street was inhabited mainly by Jewish people. In most cases, they were real estate owners, traders, and entrepreneurs as they belonged to higher levels of the middle class of society. At the beginning of the 20th century, Praga district (later divided into Praga-P√≥≈Çnoc and Praga P√≥≈Çudnie, Eng. Praga-North, Praga-South) consisted only of a couple of streets. The Jewish community decided to invest money in this area and built great houses which survived both World Wars and many other dramatic events of the history of Warsaw. ZƒÖbkowska Street was a place of entertainment from the very beginning. At Bazar R√≥≈ºyckiego (one of the most famous permanent marketplaces in Warsaw), which lies in the heart of the street, everyday, hundreds of people exchanged services and spent time together in a friendly, lazy, Warsaw-style atmosphere. ZƒÖbkowska Street was also famous for Vodka Factory ‚Äò‚ÄôKoneser‚Äù, (originally Spirit Distillation Plant) where top quality alcohol was produced. According to varsavianists, there are many fascinating stories connected with this place. ZƒÖbkowska Street today ZƒÖbkowska Street is a busy place with many restaurants and bars. In most of them, one can try Polish and Czech specialities at a very low price in comparison with other districts of Warsaw. ZƒÖbkowska Street is a student, tourist and hipster friendly place. It has become an artist hub, where many musicians and painters are still looking for inspiration. In 2013, Czes≈Çaw Mozil, famous Polish musician and TV presenter opened his restaurant there. One thing which also lures people to this place is the great atmosphere created by the natives. During the 1943 Warsaw Uprising, the population of the capital of Poland was reduced drastically. From that moment, the structure of the society changed and would never be the same, but at Praga district there is still a lot of people who inherited special features of the native citizens of Warsaw (dialect, style). According to the statistics, Praga is one of the most dangerous places in Warsaw. Future According to the future plans, ZƒÖbkowska Street will probably become a walkway. All necessary changes will be introduced as the second line of the underground railway system will be finished. The economists and business experts agree that the second ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù line will bring profits to the right-side of Warsaw and that ZƒÖbkowska Street will have the chance to become a slightly different version of another famous walkway located in Warsaw - Chmielna Street.

It features the return of his main characters, Macro and Cato to Brittania, after an absence of almost ten years. Cover description For nearly ten years, the Roman Empire has fought ceaselessly to strengthen its hold over Britannia. But opposition from native tribes led by the ruthless warrior Caratacus threatens to destroy everything. Prefect Cato and Centurion Macro are summoned by Governor Ostorius to Londinium. Tasked with leading a newly formed cavalry cohort into the heartland of Wales, they must destroy the growing resistance. But with Caratacus hatching increasingly ambitious plans and disorder threatening from within Macro and Cato's own ranks, this final test will push the soldiers to their limits. And if they do not emerge as victors, the Emperor Claudius's rule may be at stake, and the very foundations of the Roman Empire could be shattered irrevocably.

Thomas Sheridan (16 or 17 November 1775 ‚Äì 12 September 1817), known as Tom Sheridan, was the only son of the Irish playwright and poet Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the soprano Elizabeth Ann Linley, although his father had at least one other son from a second marriage. Born in mid-November 1775, Thomas initially tried for a career in politics but was unsuccessful. Early life and family The courtship of Sheridan's parents, the soprano Elizabeth Ann Linley and the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, was described in newspaper reports as \\"one of the classic romances of the west country\\" and stated that his mother was \\"the most beautiful singer in England\\"; she abandoned her career as a singer when she married Richard in April 1773 as he thought her profession reflected badly on his status as a gentleman. She had several miscarriages before Sheridan was born in mid-November 1775; she named him after Thomas Linley, and Thomas Sheridan, his maternal and paternal grandfathers respectively. The young Sheridan was sent to boarding school in Hatton, Warwickshire in early 1786, where he was educated by Samuel Parr. Parr described him as having \\"great acuteness, excellent understanding, wit and humour, but not a particle of knowledge.\\" The English historian William Smyth was engaged as his tutor after the death of Sheridan's mother in 1792. Sheridan entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1795. According to Smyth, Sheridan was the \\"idol of the young men\\" when at Cambridge and his fellow students thought him \\"the cleverest fellow in the place\\", although Smyth added his own rider clarifying that in humour and fun this was the case. Sheridan married Caroline Henrietta Callander of Craigforth (1779‚Äì1851), a daughter of Sir James Campbell, on 21 June 1805. Sheridan's father was initially against the marriage, and threatened to sever financial support to his son; Caroline did have a small inheritance but it was insufficient to fully support the couple. They had six or seven children. Their eldest son, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, was appointed as High Sheriff of Dorset in 1838 and pursued a political career. The couple's daughters included Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye; the feminist Caroline Norton; and Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset. Career Sheridan unsuccessfully tried for a political career, firstly being involved in political shenanigans with his father to gain the Liskeard seat in 1804. He failed to be elected at Stafford in 1806 and 1807. He briefly served in the army in 1803 under Lord Moira as aide-de- camp then in Ireland where he served as a muster-master general in 1806. That year, his father gifted him a 25 per cent share of the Drury Lane Theatre where Sheridan became the manager. He also undertook managerial duties at the Lyceum Theatre, London while still managing the Theatre Royal. He wrote poetry, plays and melodramas, including Description of Characters in 1808 and The Russian, which was staged for 11 performances at Drury Lane from 13 May 1813. According to the tenor Michael Kelly, a leading figure in British musical theatre, Sheridan had \\"a good voice, and a true taste for music\\". Sheridan's verse about the loss of the frigate, Saldanha, on the coastline of Ireland on 4 December 1811, was described by Captain Jesse in the biography The Life of George Brummell as having more originality than any of Sheridan's father's poems. A manuscript for the play The Siege of St Quintin staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in November 1808 demonstrates the working methods used by Sheridan and his father while managing the theatre. Drafts were read through and checked by Sheridan senior, further revised by the son and then transcribed. While carrying out his army service under Lord Moira in Edinburgh, Sheridan was intimately involved with the wife of Peter Campbell, a wealthy businessman whose work had taken him to the West Indies. The affair led to the break up of the Campbell's marriage and in 1807, Sheridan was convicted of criminal conversation over it. Campbell was awarded ¬£1,500 compensation, which Sheridan paid with money loaned by actors from the Drury Lane Theatre. Like many of his relatives, including his mother and aunt, Sheridan was afflicted with tuberculosis and he moved abroad with his wife and eldest daughter to ease the symptoms; he was appointed as the Colonial Governor's treasurer at the Cape of Good Hope in 1813 as a result of his father's influence with the Duke of York. Legacy and death Four years after taking up his appointment at the Cape of Good Hope, Sheridan died of tuberculosis on 12 September 1817; his body was transported back to Britain and buried at Wells Cathedral in his mother's grave. After his death, his widow, together with his eldest daughter returned to Britain. She adopted a reclusive lifestyle but made a name for herself by authoring several books before her death in 1851. Thomas Gainsborough painted several family portraits, particularly of Sheridan's mother, Elizabeth; a lesser known painting of Sheridan was purchased by an American art collector in 1928.

However, Pope Alexander III took the bishop of Lausanne under his protection and superseded all claims to Lausanne, thereby reducing the power of the Duke of Z√§hringen. The three bishops of the dioceses in question, however, wanted to maintain autonomy from all parties concerned. In 1162, Amadeus permitted the use of the land of Vaud, and the forests that belonged to him, by the Abbot of Haut-Cr√™t. In 1178 Amadeus donated the vineyards and tithes collected in Bossey to the canons of the chapter of St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva.

A trail in the valley leads to two small waterfalls dropping from all the year around. In the middle of the valley, a creek runs, carrying water from a spring in nearby Faralya village to the sea. A road from √ñl√ºdeniz to Uzunyurt, which is part of the Lycian Way Ultramarathon route, runs atop the rocks around the valley. Flora and fauna The valley, rich in flora and fauna, takes its name from the large number of butterfly species found here. Scientists recorded some 147 flora species belonging to 54 families and 105 butterfly species from 15 families native to the valley. The butterfly species include the Jersey tiger (Euplagia quadripunctaria rhodosensis).

It lies on the southern slopes of the Northern Range Cyprus at an altitude of 550 m near the villages of Davlos and Ardana and is also near Kantara Castle, from which it took its name. The name is of Arabic origin.S. Ektorides: 'The Holy Monastery of Kantara', Nicosia 2014 (Greek)  History  The monastery was probably established in the 11th or 12th centuries AD. It was first mentioned in the 13th century in connection to the martyrdom of its thirteen monks. In the year 1221 AD two monks, Ioannis and Konon came to Cyprus from Asia Minor . They eventually settled in Kantara where they acquired fame and were joined by eleven other monks from Cyprus and elsewhere. It was at this period that the Latin Church tried to subjugate the Orthodox Church of Cyprus . The thirteen monks were accused of heresy, imprisoned in 1228 and finally burned at the stake on the riverbed of the Pedieos in Nicosia on the 19th of May 1231.K. Sathas: 'Medieval Library' Venice 1873. Chapter B, p. 20-39 (Greek) 'kypria Miniea-May' Nicosia 2000. p 132-154 (Greek) The monastery ceased to exist until probably the middle of the 17th century when Archbishop Nikiforos built a new Monastery as it is testified by the icon of Panagia Kantariotissa painted by icon painter Leontion in that period.A. Papageorgiou: 'Christian Art in the occupied areas of Cyprus' Nicosia 2000, p. 139 (Greek) Later Archbishop Chrysanthos completely rebuilt the church and its surrounding buildings in 1773. Abbott Makarios commissioned in 1783 icon painter Laurentios to paint the icons of the 'Iconostasis'. The monastery at this period thrived, it had 14 monks and sizable property in land and animals. It belonged to the Diocese of the Archbishopric. It seems that the monastery declined by the mid 19th century and finally abandoned, save a hermit called Symeon late in the 19th century.E. Scott-Stevenson: 'Our Home in Cyprus' London 1880, p. 246. It was visited by George Jeffery in the 1910s describing it as a small monotholos church surrounded by monastic buildings.G. Jeffery: 'A Description of the Historic Monuments of Cyprus' Nicosia 1918, p. 244 Early in the 20th century the monastic property was rented out to villagers and minor repairs were made including a bell tower. In 1925 a number of Famagustan families managed to buy land from the Monastery and with the help of the British District Commissioner, established a small mountain resort. Hence the church of the Monastery became a 'parish church', celebrating every 15 August Our Lady's Assumption, as well as, on the 19th of May, the thirteen monks martyrdom. On August 14, 1974 the Turkish Army captured Kantara. Soon all the Icons were taken by smugglers and all furniture and fittings disappeared. It was fortunate that Church Commissioner P. Ctorides had previously taken photos of each one of the church icons for people to remember and perhaps one day some might be recovered. The church building now is in need of urgent repairs.

When funds for fortifications ran low and Bahamians were taxed to raise money, he had difficulties with his Assembly. They were unhappy with the new taxation and stopped his salary and so he dissolved the Assembly. Despite these difficulties and war with Spain and France, privateers in Nassau seized enemy ships and the whole economy shared in prize money from the vessels. In fact, so many Bahamians were involved in privateering, that traditional industries like agriculture were neglected.Islanders in the Stream: A History of the Bahamian People. Volume 2: From Aboriginal Times to the End of Slavery. By Michael Craton, Gail Saunders Tinker had found it difficult to eradicate privateering or entice new settlers as the cost of living was high and the currency was in a poor state. Most of the difficulties he encountered he tended to blame on the people he governed, rather than his own ability to govern. Freemasons Tinker had joined the Freemasons in London in 1730 and, in 1755, he made the long journey from New Providence to Philadelphia to attend the greatest procession of Masons ever seen in America at the inauguration of a new Lodge.

There are seven wells in a square shape. Wells are only 3‚Äì4 feet deep and you can clearly see the bottom. The temperature is considerably high but vary slightly from one spring to another. Wells run out of water, when 10-15 buckets of water are taken out. History The old ruins of the monastery still visible over the area, but it seems that most of those artifacts were destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War. On 9 September 2011, the seven hot water wells, Chaitya mound and other scattered building ruins in the site were formally recognised by the Government as archaeological protected monuments. The designation was declared under the government Gazette number 1723. A Stupa mound belonging to the early Anuradhapura period and an inscription of 1-2 centuries A.D. were found from the recent archaeological excavations done at the site. The inscription reveals that the waters of five tanks located in nearby area were reserved for the usage of Buddhist monks who were residing in a temple. Legend Religious Hindu rituals dedicated to lost loved ones are observed by the Sri Lankan Tamils at this site, believed in folklore to have been started by Ravana, antagonist of the epic Ramayana. According to local folklore, this site is connected with the antagonist Ravana of the Hindu epic, Ramayana. Ravana and his mother worshipped Hindu God Shiva at the Koneswaram temple and the Hot springs of Kanniya. Ravana wanted to remove the temple of Koneswaram when his mother was in ailing health. As Ravana was heaving the rock, Lord Shiva made him drop his sword. When Ravana's mother heard the news, she was wrought with unbeatable sorrow. When Ravana returned, he found his beloved mother's demise and was disheartened. To perform his mother's rites, Ravana stuck the earth with his sword in several spots and several fountains sprang from these points. The water was hot and such was the beginning of the hot water springs. Mahabharata, the Hindu epic notes that hot well is near Gokarna bay, in the middle of the ocean and is the island shrine of Uma's consort Shiva, known in the three worlds and worshipped by all peoples from the subcontinent, including the native tribes Naga, Deva and the Yaksha, the rivers, ocean and mountains.Vyasa. (400 BCE). Mahabharata. Sections LXXXV and LXXXVIII. Book 3. pp. 46-47, 99 It continues that the Koneshwara Temple and Hot water spring is the next pilgrimage spot for Hindus en route south following Kanyakumari of the early Pandyan kingdom and Tamiraparni island (Kudiramalai) and that worshippers should fast for three days at the temple.\\"Listen as I now recount the isle of Tamraparni, gemmed upon the ocean. The gods underwent austerities there, in a desire to attain greatness. In that region also is the lake of Gokarna. Then one should go to Gokarna, renowned in the three worlds. O Indra among kings! It is in the middle of the ocean and is worshipped by all the worlds. Brahma, the Devas, the rishis, the ascetics, the bhutas (spirits or ghosts), the yakshas, the pishachas, the kinnaras, the great nagas, the siddhas, the charanas, the gandharvas, humans, the pannagas, rivers ocean and mountains worship Uma's consort there\\". Mahabharata.

The German allies did also request the National Republican Guard to provide 7 000 personnel to strengthen their air-defence units: General Ricci rejected the German request and therefore was dismissed. The new Chief of Staff of the National Republican Guard, General Nicchiarelli, decided the establishment of a \\"Anti-aircraft and Anti-tank\\" Division with counter-paratroopers duties, which would have gathered all still-autonomous combat units of the Italian Social Republic, including the Paratrooper Battalion \\"Mazzarini\\", the Armoured Group \\"Leonessa\\", the I Assault Battalion \\"Roma\\" and other units. The Etna Division operated under operational directives of the German Flak Command. The division was based on two combat groups: the first was deployed on Sesia and Agogna rivers in Piedmont, to protect Lombardy, and the other was deployed between Adria, Rovigo, Ferrara, Mantua, and Ravenna. The commander was General Giuseppe Volante, killed in action January 2, 1945. After the death of General Volante, Major General Giovanni Bocchio was appointed to lead the division. In April 1945, when the Gothic Line was broken out, the southern divisional group surrendered; the Piedmontese combat group did not manage to reach Lombardy and had to surrender in various places of Piedmont.

Known from the Chengjiang, its biological affinity is uncertain; it somewhat resembles the tubes of the 'priapulid' Selkirkia, but a cnidarian affinity is also possible. In the absence of soft parts, there really isn't enough data to confirm a biological affiliation. Archotuba elongata The extinct species Archotuba elongata is a debated priapulid from the Early Cambrian, discovered by Luo and Hu in 1999. Recorded only in the Yunnan Province of the Chengjiang Biota, this species was initially found to be part of the phylum Priapulida, but some have raised the question that A. elongata may be related to the cnidarians. In fact, due to the lack of soft body preservation, not only does confusion remain as to the placement of A. elongata, the another described species, Archotuba conoidalis, has been found to be a synonym of A. elongata. The available specimens consist of hundreds of compressed tubes, white with some rust-colored blotches, each in shape a long cone and at most 5 cm in length and 6 mm in width. The posterior is pointed, but save for a few rare annulations, the fossil is unadorned. The creature's intestine is visible along its midline, and its dark color may indicate a carnivorous nature. The habits of A. elongata are disputable: a popular explanation is that because this species is often found fixed to other creatures, and even clustered together with its own kind in similar orientations, it perhaps did not move, highly unlike the current understanding of priapulids. However, if indeed they were sedentary like the cnidarians, no tentacles have been preserved to support such a conjecture.

Kaiser SX of the Austrian Bundesheer A walking excavator or popularly spider excavator is a special type of all-terrain excavator. Like the regular excavator it consists of a boom, stick, bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the \\"house\\". However, its house sits atop an undercarriage consisting of leg or arm-like extensions with or without wheels. All extensions can move in increments, hence the name walking excavator. This is different from an early 20th century dragline excavator where a set of feet plate are alternately lifted and lowered.A Walking Excavator The Literary Digest, July 29, 1916 History Most traditional excavators have tracks or wheels as undercarriage which limits their usability on steep inclines, uneven terrain or inaccessible positions. In 1966, Edwin Ernst Menzi (1897‚Äì1984) and Joseph Kaiser (1928‚Äì1993) together invented the walking excavator for work on mountain slopes. Subsequently, Kaiser AG, Schaanwald, Liechtenstein, and Menzi Muck AG, Kriessern, Switzerland, developed separately excavators.Walking Excavator and Mobility Unusual off- road locomotion website, September 2010 Despite the advantages of the design it failed to be widely used due to little gain in mobility, considering most work are in urban areas, less comfort, expensive design plus expensive electro-hydraulic control and maintenance.

The undercarriage design varies widely from model to model and between specialized roles. The number of legs or wheels can also vary from e.g. three (Menzi Muck 5000T2) to four. The \\"leg\\" design can also vary from fixed to telescoping arms. Most modern walking excavators have rotating or powered wheels allowing them to roll or drive depending on the need.

History Youngstown Browns: 1939‚Äì1941 The team was first established as the Youngstown Browns, an affiliate of the St. Louis Browns, in 1939. The team's overall performance was uneven, but it peaked during its second season. In 1939, the Browns ranked seventh in the eight-team league, but the team rebounded the following year. In 1940, the Browns were poised to take the championship but lost to the Akron Yankees. The Browns disbanded when the Mid-Atlantic League suspended operations at the outset of America's entry into World War II. The team is best remembered for its role in launching the career of major league player Floyd Baker, who married a Youngstown native and made the city his honorary hometown.. Youngstown Gremlins and Colts: 1946‚Äì1948 After the war, Youngstown fielded a new team for the Middle Atlantic League, the Youngstown Gremlins. The club made its debut in 1946, the sixth consecutive season in which the National Amateur Baseball Federation tournament was held in Youngstown, Ohio. The team was owned by the Pittsburgh sportsmen Bill Koval and Nick Andolina, who \\"bankrolled\\" the reorganization of the Mid-Atlantic League in 1946. The team went 67-62, good for third place in the six-team league. They were defeated in the first round of the playoffs, three games to one, to the Erie Sailors. The owners acknowledged that the team had been a losing venture at the close of the 1946 season but indicated to Frank Ward, sports editor of The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, that they would continue to sponsor the club in 1947. Youngstown's star performer was Johnny Kucab, who eventually moved on to the major leagues. As a pitcher for the Gremlins, Kucab posted a 13-1 record, followed up by 12-4. He had the best winning percentage and pitched four shutouts in his 15 starts, tying him for second in the Mid-Atlantic League in whitewashes. Kucab was brought up by the Philadelphia Athletics in 1951. The team was renamed as the Youngstown Colts in 1947. The Gremlins' brief run coincided with the 33rd NABF sandlot \\"world series\\", which won recognition for Youngstown among national observers. A local newspaper editorial stated: \\"If any other city has comparable equipment, it is not generally known. Baseball Commissioner Chandler exclaimed in surprise that our sandlot fields are better than the parks of many professional teams\\". Youngstown Athletics: 1949‚Äì1951 In 1949 the team's name changed to Youngstown Athletics and the team enjoyed a working relationship with the Philadelphia Athletics. The team posted a 74-64 record, for third-place in the league in 1949. The following year the team posted a 51-61 record, for fourth-place. However the 1951 season, would be the team's last as the club relocated to Oil City, Pennsylvania on June 2, 1951. The Oil City club then disbanded 2 months later on August 6. That year also turned out to be the last for the Mid-Atlantic League, as the organization soon folded. Minor league baseball would not return to the Mahoning Valley until 1999, when nearby Niles, Ohio became the home for the Cleveland Indians‚Äô affiliate in the New York‚ÄìPenn League, the Mahoning Valley Scrappers.

The theorem was first stated and proven by Nina Byers and Chen-Ning Yang (1961), and further developed by Felix Bloch (1970). Proof An enclosed flux \\\\Phi corresponds to a vector potential A(r) inside the annulus with a line integral \\\\oint_C A\\\\cdot dl=\\\\Phi along any path C that circulates around once. One can try to eliminate this vector potential by the gauge transformation : \\\\psi'(\\\\\\\\{r_n\\\\\\\\})=\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{ie}{\\\\hbar}\\\\sum_j\\\\chi(r_j)\\\\right)\\\\psi(\\\\\\\\{r_n\\\\\\\\}) of the wave function \\\\psi(\\\\\\\\{r_n\\\\\\\\}) of electrons at positions r_1,r_2,\\\\ldots. The gauge-transformed wave function satisfies the same Schr√∂dinger equation as the original wave function, but with a different magnetic vector potential A'(r)=A(r)+ abla\\\\chi(r). It is assumed that the electrons experience zero magnetic field B(r)= abla\\\\times A(r)=0 at all points r inside the annulus, the field being nonzero only within the opening (where there are no electrons). It is then always possible to find a function \\\\chi(r) such that A'(r)=0 inside the annulus, so one would conclude that the system with enclosed flux \\\\Phi is equivalent to a system with zero enclosed flux. However, for any arbitrary \\\\Phi the gauge transformed wave function is no longer single-valued: The phase of \\\\psi' changes by : \\\\delta\\\\phi=(e/\\\\hbar)\\\\oint_C abla\\\\chi(r)\\\\cdot dl=-(e/\\\\hbar)\\\\oint_C A(r)\\\\cdot dl=-2\\\\pi\\\\Phi/\\\\Phi_0 whenever one of the coordinates r_n is moved along the ring to its starting point. The requirement of a single-valued wave function therefore restricts the gauge transformation to fluxes \\\\Phi that are an integer multiple of \\\\Phi_0. Systems that enclose a flux differing by a multiple of h/e are equivalent. Applications An overview of physical effects governed by the Byers-Yang theorem is given by Yoseph Imry. These include the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect, persistent current in normal metals, and flux quantization in superconductors.

Initially titled Folia de Estudantes, this motion picture was shot entirely in a single week at the studios and labs of Cin√©dia. It premiered on July 8, 1935 at The Cine Alhambra, in Rio de Janeiro. It played in most theaters for two weeks. It was also shown in S√£o Paulo, at Cine Odeon (Sala Vermelha), debuting on July 15 of that year. Viewed historically as a lost film, as of 2017, no prints of this motion picture are known to exist.  Plot  Carmen Miranda, in her role as a radio singer named Mimi, is seen courted by three students.Eduardo Giffoni Fl√≥rido, As grandes personagens da hist√≥ria do cinema brasileiro, Editora Fraiha, 1999.  Production  The film was a co-production of Waldow Filmes and Cin√©dia studios, directed by Wallace Downey and based on a script by musicians Jo√£o de Barro and Alberto Ribeiro. The setting is at a student residence within a university. The Mimi character was Carmen Miranda's debut acting role on film. She also sings in the movie. The crooner romantically pursuing her is played by M√°rio Reis. Two other students, played by Mesquetinha and B√°rbosa J√∫nior, also vie for her affections, giving rise to a wealth of comic incidents. Although the film's soundtrack featured well-known carnival \\"marchas\\" and sambas, it was not designed to tie in with any annual celebrations. The film was an example of so-called 'mid-year' productions (de meio de ano), the premieres of which were often timed to coincide with the 'festas juninas' or popular Catholic festivals held in June. Inspired by the success of this film, other vehicles for carnival music, the 'mid-year' musicals, were created as publicity tools to promote the radio and record industries. \\"Estudantes\\" featured musical numbers associated with popular religious celebrations. The song 'Cad√™ Mimi?' (Where's Mimi?), performed by M√°rio Reis as he serenades Carmen Miranda's character, subsequently became a huge hit throughout Brazil.

An anonymous P. de L., writing for the Rio newspaper O Globo on 25 June 1935, called it a retrograde step in relation to \\"Al√¥, al√¥, Brasil!\\". Alfredo Sade, writing in the Rio-based publication A Batalha in July 1935, argued that Estudantes was a far superior film. He praised the quality of photography and the sound in what he termed this 'very Brazilian musical comedy'. Another anonymous review by a certain A. F. in the newspaper Di√°rio Portugu√™s of July 1935 argued that Estudantes's greatest value was its spontaneity and the promise that it and its young creators represented for the future of the cinema industry in Brazil. This potential was to be more fully realised in Cin√©dia's next production, Al√¥, Al√¥, Carnaval!.  Musical numbers  * Linda Mimi ... Performed by M√°rio Reis * Sonho de Papel ...

Schrier is an American former photographer who escaped from al Qaeda. Early life and career Schrier is from Deer Park, New York, and attended Hofstra University, where he was an English major who also studied film production. He entered Syria with the help of the Free Syrian Army. Schrier captured images of FSA rebels fighting forces of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.  Abduction by the al-Nusra Front  In late December 2012, Schrier was captured by Jabhat al-Nusra, the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, while traveling on the road between Aleppo and the Turkish border. A Jeep Cherokee cut across from the side of the road and three men jumped out. Schrier told 60 Minutes, \\"One of 'em was cloaked completely in black, you know, like the guys in the movies -- scarf around his face, AK-47 in his hand, and he took me out, put me in the back seat of the Cherokee and he put the barrel of the gun to the side of my head.\\" He was among a collection of kidnapped American journalists held by Syrian jihadis. He was eventually held in a series of rebel-controlled prisons in the Syrian city of Aleppo. He strategically converted to Islam in March 2013 as a survival tactic to get better treatment, a tactic that ended up working.  Escape  In July 2013 Schrier became the first Westerner to ever escape from al Qaeda. Before sunrise he squeezed himself through a small window with the help of his cellmate Peter Theo Curtis, who got stuck in the window and did not escape. According to Schrier this was despite his best efforts to get him out - Curtis however disputes this and maintains Schrier failed to help him adequately and abandoned him, while simultaneously admitting that he told Schrier to go. During the planning of the escape Schrier claims that Curtis knocked on the door to alert the guards about the escape, a claim Curtis admitted in an interview with Die Zeit. Aftermath His book The Dawn Prayer (Or How to Survive in a Secret Syrian Terrorist Prison): A Memoir () was published on April 3rd, 2018. In January 2020, Schrier filed a lawsuit against Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), as he claimed that they provide sponsorship for al-Qaeda.

He was fluent in four languages. Living in New York since 1949, he kept in contact with his home town Frankfurt am Main which he frequently visited in the last 14 years of his life. As time witness of the Third Reich he tirelessly spoke to the students of his former high school (W√∂hlerschule), and gave lectures and interviews in numerous Frankfurt institutions. Life =In Frankfurt am Main (1921-1939)= Peter Bloch was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, to a family of medical doctors and Spanish-Jewish scholars. His grandfather James Israel (1848‚Äì1926) was a pioneer in modern urological and renal surgery in Berlin. Peter lived with his family in Lindenstrasse 39 in the Westend of Frankfurt am Main, surrounded by great works of art, rare books and antique furniture that - packed for shipping - were confiscated by NS authorities in Rotterdam in 1944 and never recovered. His father Dr. med. Arthur Bloch - a former assistant of his grandfather's - was Senior urological consultant in a Frankfurt hospital before he was dismissed in 1933 due to the NS laws. In 1939 Peter Bloch graduated from the Philanthropin, a renowned Jewish high school in Frankfurt am Main which he had attended since 1936 after being forced to leave his former high school \\"W√∂hler Realgymnasium\\" (today W√∂hlerschule), then in the Frankfurt Westend. In spring 1939, some weeks after graduating, Peter Bloch emigrated to England. =In England and Belgium (1939-1942)= Peter Bloch studied Hispanic history and culture since his youth. His art teacher considered him a most promising student. However, it was his very love of art that made him realize that he was not called upon to be a painter, but a writer. In 1939, while he stayed in London, his parents had to go into exile in Belgium. England had offered exile to his father, but not to the family which also included Luise F√∂lsche, called \\"Lite\\", his mother Else Bloch's nanny and companion since the 1890s. England's offer of asylum was rejected and in late August 1939 Peter Bloch joined his family in Belgium. He started to study History at the University of Brussels. After the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, he joined the underground resistance and handed out summaries of BBC radio broadcasts. If found out, he would have faced certain death. By the summer of 1942 a time of terror began for the Jews in Belgium. In June 1942 a warning came from the Jewish Council in Brussels of Peter's imminent deportation. His father bought him a false identity card bearing the name Pierre Boulanger. When his parents received the written order for his deportation on July 16, 1942, Peter had already crossed the Franco-Swiss border with a smuggler on July 11, 1942. In Belgium his parents found separate hiding-places. On August 13, 1943, his father was captured by the Gestapo and on the same day hanged by the SS in the Dossin Barracks (transit camp) at Mechelen. =In Switzerland (July 1942-May 1945)= By correspondence his parents had mobilized all their Swiss connections in Peter's favour. He was granted asylum and interned. Eventually he was allowed to study in the University of Geneva. However, during vacations he had to return to a labour camp. In the book When I was Pierre Boulanger, Peter Bloch recalled, ‚ÄûThe conditions of internment were very bad in Bellechasse prison and better in the labor camps where the Swiss used refugees as slave labor‚Äú. By 1944, Bloch was anxious to return to his mother and Luise F√∂lsche who had been paralyzed by a stroke in 1943. Mother and son reunited in Brussels on May 30, 1945; unfortunately their beloved \\"Lite\\" had died two weeks earlier. In his book When I was Pierre Boulanger Peter Bloch said: ‚ÄûToday it still hurts me that I did not see her (Lite) again. She had wanted so much for me to come back in time. My mother used to refer to the three of us as 'Three birds on a perch' in World War II - and our closeness to each other, which is everlasting. Now there's only one melancholy bird left on the Perch.‚Äú =In New York (1949-2008)= Peter Bloch arrived in New York with his mother Else Israel Bloch (1891‚Äì1988) in 1949. His half-brother Werner Czapski (1912‚Äì1972), an engineer afflicted with MS, joined them later. Bloch earned a living writing for European newspapers and became a U.S. citizen in 1955. His mother having instilled the tradition of respect, admiration and pride which Spanish Jews feel for Hispanic culture made it natural for Peter Bloch to get immersed in Puerto Rican life in New York. Josephine Burgos, a cousin of Julia de Burgos, acquainted him with the community at large and with her own family. In an interview (\\"Daily News\\", 1974) he said: ‚ÄûI heard a lot of foolish and dangerous talk about them, even from other minorities who should know better. I felt it important to tell their story, why? Because no one else would.‚Äú Bloch believed that what the Puerto Ricans needed most was a sense of their own worth as heirs to a rich culture, that they had every reason to be proud of their heritage. In his book, La-Le-Lo-Lai - Puerto Rican music and its performers, he advised: ‚ÄûFor those who want to acquire some notions about the contribution to the civilization of the Americas and of the Hispanic nations Puerto Rican Music is one of the best venues of approach; for the message of music is universal, cosmic, and transcends any language barrier.‚Äú He said, ‚ÄûWhenever I visit Puerto Rico I feel as if it were my own country.‚Äú With great affection, devotion and without remuneration Peter Bloch produced concerts, recitals, poetry readings, radio programs (WNYC-AM), pioneered art exhibitions (New York & Germany), wrote books and articles for countless magazines, established a Puerto Rican Library & Museum at La Hermosa Christian Church, founded the \\"Association for Puerto Rican-Hispanic Culture\\" (1965) and the \\"Rafael Hern√°ndez Festival\\" (1967). Peter Bloch was named Trustee of the \\"Alfred Fahndrich Santos Collection\\". This Collection was on exhibition at the \\"Museum of Hispanic Contemporary Art\\", and now resides at \\"Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College\\" of the City University of New York. For his selfless advocacy on behalf of the Puerto Rican-Hispanic Culture, Peter Bloch was honoured frequently. In 1955 he was honoured by the \\"League of Belgian and allied Patriots\\". He also received 3 recognition awards from Boricua College. He was also the recipient of the Key to the Capital City of San Juan, Puerto Rico (1964), was made a Knight of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (1969) and was awarded the Gold Medal from Soci√©t√© Acad√©mique Fond√©e En 1915 Paris France \\"Arts-Sciences-Lettres\\" (1985). Peter Bloch was the United States representative of the Academic Society \\"Arts-Sciences-Lettres\\" of Paris. He lectured at universities in Madrid, Venezuela and throughout North and South America. He was also a writer for \\"Poes√≠a Magazine\\" and a judge for the ACE Awards. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Albert Schweitzer were influences on Peter Bloch's formation. He used to refer to Goethe as the poet of German thought. He embraced Schweitzer's postulate that civilization and culture are the same - that culture is an ethical value.

Initially, the campaign was launched by Obelisk Legal Support Solutions, in partnership with The Law Society and the Bar Council but has since received the support of all other professional organisations from the Law Society of Scotland, Chartered Institute of Legal Executives and the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the four Inns of Court. The First 100 Years is a five-year project which seeks to discover the untold stories of pioneering and inspiring women in the legal profession to create a strong and equal future for all those in the legal profession. The project was officially launched in March 2015 and runs to 2020, marking the 100-year anniversary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 and culminating in the donation of the original material collected and created by the project over its lifetime to the LSE Women's Library in 2020. The project has been the public focal point of the centenary celebrations. Background Dana Denis-Smith, CEO and founder of Obelisk Legal Support Solutions, came up with the idea for the project after seeing a particular photograph depicting a lone woman partner standing among male partners in a top law firm. The project was started on International Women‚Äôs Day in 2014 and launched officially on 12 March 2015 at House of Lords. Launching the project, Denis-Smith said, ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know their history ‚Äî who the first woman solicitor was, for instance. There is no archive like the First 100 Years to help us place ourselves in history.‚Äù About The campaign initially started as a video project documenting the lives of leading women in law of the last century. Since, it has developed more multimedia work, with its book due to be released in November 2019. Videos Running until 2020, the project commissioned almost 100 documentary interviews with past and present leading women in the legal profession including. The interviews have been released throughout the life of the project to help it inform and inspired the legal profession of the contribution of women. All the films are free to the public to watch. Some of the films released to date are those of the following legal personalities: Baroness Brenda Hale Mary Arden, Lady Arden Baroness Helena Kennedy Cherie Booth QC Dame Linda Dobbs Dame Rosalyn Higgins Baroness Hale taking part in the First 100 Years interview for the documentary film of her life and work. Supreme Court, 25 February 2016. Major General Susan Ridge Sandie Okoro The project has been gathering statements and create biographies which depict the journey of women in the law since 1919, with the aim of creating the first digital museum dedicated to the history of women in law. The project aims to create a positive account of the history of women in law, in contrast to the ‚Äònegative narrative of the diversity debate‚Äô, and to ‚Äòcelebrate the past and change the future of the profession‚Äô. Exhibition In September 2018, the University of Oxford, Faculty of Law, hosted a decade-by- decade exhibition curated by the project as a print and display touring exhibition. Since then, the exhibition has been touring the UK in various locations to the UK Supreme Court , the Royal Courts of Justice to the University of Leeds, University of Worcester or Winchester's Great Hall Podcasts In January 2019, First 100 Years launched a series of 10 podcasts, one per month, following the course of the 100 years of women in law in a decade by decade format. In collaboration with Goldman Sachs and Linklaters, this series of ten podcasts charts the history of women in the legal professions. Progressing decade-by-decade, the podcasts are 45-minute discussions between legal pioneers, historians, academics and legal practitioners based on key themes, including gender stereotypes, the work/life balance and diversity. \\"Removing the statutory barrier was just the start: as the podcasts illustrate, women continued to face non-legislative barriers, such as the entrenched sexism and male dominance of the profession, its often trivial objections to women entrants, and the uphill struggle of balancing family life with a career. For example, Nemone Lethbridge, who appears in The Fourth Decade: 1949 ‚Äì 1959, was the first woman to get tenancy at 3 Hare Court, where she was barred from using from the lavatory: a lock had been installed on the lavatory and each male member given a key, and she was told to use the public toilets in the Kardomah coffee house in Fleet Street.\\" The podcast series is presented by Lucinda Acland. Lucinda has been a volunteer for First 100 Years since November 2015 and is a qualified lawyer. She has experience of recording voice programmes with the First 100 Years project, at the University of Law and at Obelisk Support. All episodes are free to access. Book Marking the centenary of the 1919 Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, First: 100 Years of Women in Law (Scala Arts & Heritage publishers) tells the story of women in law in their first 100 years of practice. The book is available after 3 November 2019. From early campaigners through to the first women solicitors, barristers, magistrates and judges, the book tells the often untold stories of the pioneers, reformers and influencers who paved the way, revealing the barriers they faced, their challenges and triumphs. It offers a unique insight into how women have made their way in a profession still dominated by men and looks ahead to the prospects for women in law in the next 100 years. The book is co-authored by Lucinda Acland and Katie Broomfield with First 100 Years. ‚ÄúFirst 100 Years of Women in Law is a fascinating, beautiful, inspirational and, above all, important portrait of the first century of female empowerment in the legal system. Charting through photographs and historical artefacts the milestones since the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 put the first cracks in the glass ceiling of the legal profession, this book offers not only a unique celebration of the progress achieved by women in the law, but a vital reminder of how much work there still is to do.‚Äù ‚Äì The Secret Barrister ‚ÄúA fascinating and indispensable insight into the female pioneers of the legal profession.‚Äù ‚Äì Caroline Criado-Perez  See also  * First 100 Years Timeline * First 100 Years Videos References External links * First 100 Years website * Spark21 (charity) website * Obelisk Legal Support Solutions website Category:Women's history Category:2014 establishments in England ","title":"First 100 Years"},{"id":"43731462","text":"Hafsa Hatun () was a Turkish princess, and the wife of Sultan Bayezid I of the Ottoman Empire.

It is accessed via the Gladstone Bridge from Broad Street, to the south of Barry Memorial Hall, and along the Ffordd-Y-Mileniwm road from the southeast, leading on from Cardiff Road approached via Palmerston. History Barry Waterfront sign Plans for redevelopment of the waterfront in Barry date back to 1988, during the period that Cardiff Bay was undergoing major redevelopment by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. Like the one further along the coast in Cardiff, the Barry Waterfront redevelopment scheme has been one of the largest to be undertaken in the UK. The Associated British Ports (ABP) and the Welsh Development Agency began undertaking a multimillion-pound land regeneration programme on 77 hectares (190 acres) of land next to the Number One Dock, working with the Barry Joint Initiative from 1991, and the Barry Waterfront Consortium was established to manage the regeneration scheme of the derelict area at the Number One Dock. The David's Wharf apartments of Barry Waterfront In 2001, Morrisons opened a new branch at the site, and a 55,000 sq ft non- food retail park adjacent to the site, hosting Focus DIY, Halfords, Argos, and a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, was completed in 2004. In 2002, Westbury Homes were given the green light to build new ¬£12 million apartments at Barry Waterfront, to be named David's Wharf after David Davies, who established the Barry Docks. Byron Lewis, project manager, stated at the time of the fifth residential development at the site that \\"The new development will build on the success of Waterfront Barry as a top quality site for economic and community growth\\". At the same time it was announced that there were plans to remove the Vopak chemical tanks from the Barry Island side of the docks. In 2004, Cooke & Arkwright and Chesterton, acting on behalf of Associated British Ports and the Welsh Development Agency sold land at Holton Reach in the western part of the area to housing developer Redrow plc, who were given the go ahead to build a new estate at Holton Reach with 84 private houses and 29 \\"affordable homes\\", a doctor's surgery, and a community centre incorporating a church. In October 2007, a new ¬£350 million project was announced to build 400 new homes and to develop a 300,000 square foot area for commercial and leisure use, led by a consortium of Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon Homes and Barratt Homes. In December 2007 it was announced that there were plans to build an offshore windfarm at the Barry and Cardiff waterfronts. By 2008, 782 houses had been approved on the site, and 686 houses completed, in addition to of retail park, a health centre and pharmacy, and a Morrisons supermarket. In July 2011, the Vale of Glamorgan Council approved plans for the developmental phase of the site, which will include the redevelopment of West Pond/South Quay, East Quay and Arno Quay areas of the old docks. In March 2012, a ¬£230 million project to include \\"private and affordable housing, cafes, restaurants, play areas and public spaces\\" was granted planning permission. However, in July 2012, it was found that contamination levels on the site exceeded those which had been initially anticipated, and two years later the project was still stalled. A further delay of 12 months is expected. A waterfront caf√© quarter is to be established as well as further expansion of the residential area to some 2,000 houses. Culture Tall Ship at the Barry Waterfront The Barry Waterfront Festival is an annual event held in September. Historically, the Tall Ships Festival has been part of the Barry Waterfront Festival, although construction issues at the waterfront effected the Tall Ships event in 2013. The Prince William and Tenacious tallships were a significant local attraction on the waterfront. Features It contains a Morrisons supermarket, a KFC, Halfords, Pets at Home, Argos, Poundstretcher, the Waterfront Medical Practice, Barry Waterfront Centre (also hosting Charles Church), a housing estate, and a branch of the Premier Inn. To the south of the retail park are modern apartments along the waterfront, known as David's Wharf, along Y Rhodfa.

Early life and education Stummer studied English literature at Birmingham University, and post-graduate journalism at City University, London. Career In the late 1980s Stummer was a freelance writer for the Observer newspaper and the foreign desk of the Independent. He has also worked as a researcher for the author and journalist William Shawcross, current Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, on his biography of Rupert Murdoch. Stummer travelled in Eastern Europe in the 1980s. In 1989 and 1990 he was based in Sofia, Bulgaria, covering the fall of the Communist government of Todor Zhivkov, and its aftermath, for the Independent and other titles. At the Independent on Sunday he covered arts, culture and heritage, and subsequently at the Guardian, where he was a journalist for Weekend magazine. He wrote on heritage, architecture, war and music. He is the only journalist to have taken part in a Russian Air Force surveillance flight, over Britain. In 1997 Stummer covered the General Election clash in the Tatton constituency, in the county of Cheshire, between Neil Hamilton and former BBC war correspondent Martin Bell, for the Independent on Sunday. Other work by Stummer has included news and feature writing for the Observer, Guardian, Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers, and the New Statesman, Independent on Sunday Review and Quintessentially magazines, the latter as contributing editor. He is an occasional contributor to Private Eye. He has reported from across Europe, Russia and the Middle East. Stummer has taken part in architecture and cultural protection campaigns, including those to protect the 17th-century Hampshire farmhouse home of portrait painter Mary Beale, the first woman professional artist in Britain to manage her own studio; the efforts to keep open the Foundry bar in Shoreditch, east London, haunt of artists of the 1990s Britart scene; and to prevent the loss of historic buildings in the historic Liberty of Norton Folgate district of East London; and to protect the medieval Harmondsworth Great Barn, Middlesex, at risk from the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. He has written on the threat to Soviet-era buildings in Moscow, the destruction of ancient villages in eastern Germany to make way for open-cast coal mines, and the discovery of a house with close links to the artist Peter Paul Rubens, near Antwerp, which local campaigners fear will be harmed with the expansion of the city's nearby container port. He blogs on culture and heritage for The Oldie magazine. Cornerstone magazine In 2004 Stummer launched Cornerstone magazine, an architecture protection quarterly. He was the magazine‚Äôs editor. It was published by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB), a conservation organization. The magazine became a formal Journal of Record for the British Library, London, and Library of Congress, Washington. Its editions included coverage of heritage and conservation issues and extensive photography. Writers included Germaine Greer, Julie Burchill, Jeanette Winterson, Martin Bell, John Tusa, Ken Russell, Bill Bryson, Robert Fisk and Rod Liddle. Photographers included John Lawrence, Si Barber, Kippa Matthews, Laurence Weedy and Andy Marshall. Under his editorship, from 2002 until early 2012, Cornerstone reported on major conservation aspects of plans for airport expansion in south-east England. In particular he published articles about likely damage to heritage buildings, sites and landscapes posed by the HS2 high-speed rail scheme from London to the north of England. Cornerstone was the first publication to report on HS2's harmful effect on legally protected areas and sites in England. Its reporting on HS2 was followed up by the BBC, and the national press. Cornerstone suddenly ceased publication in 2012 when its publishers created a new magazine to take the place of Cornerstone, under a new Editor.

The Commodores were led by Red Sanders, in his first season as head coach. Members of the Southeastern Conference, Vanderbilt went 3‚Äì6‚Äì1 overall and 1‚Äì5‚Äì1 in conference play. The Commodores played their seven home games at Dudley Field in Nashville, Tennessee. Schedule Bear Bryant The 1940 season was coach Sanders only losing season as a head coach. The Commodores opened the 1940 season with a win over Washington and Lee and a loss to Princeton. Next on the schedule was Kentucky, which was favored to win the game. The game was played in Dudley Field. Fred Russell of the Nashville Banner recommended to Vanderbilt Coach Red Sanders that he hire Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant to his staff. On Thursday October 10, 1940, Sanders was taken to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. The Tennessean reported: \\"Paul (Bear) Bryant, line coach who took over the head man's job yesterday when Sanders had his inflamed appendix whacked out, was doubtful last night if Ellis would be of much service. In fact, he was not counting on starting him but hoped that he would be available for some duty.\\" \\"The loss of Sanders, who is not apt to be back on the practice field for two weeks, if that soon, was a jolt. Bryant is thoroughly capable of handling the Commodores, but the absence of Sanders leaves him with two tasks to perform and it requires a super man for such an undertaking.\\" Before the game, Sanders talked to the team by telephone from the hospital bed at Vanderbilt. The game ended in a tie Kentucky 7-7. Bryant had this to say after coaching his first game as an acting head coach: \\"I couldn‚Äôt ask a bunch of boys to play a better game than they did today. Bob Gude played the greatest game at center I‚Äôve ever seen. Roy Huggins was marvelous. (Dan) Walton, (Mac) Peebles, (William) McElreath, (Eddie) Atkinson, (Blinks) Bushmiser‚Äîwell, all of them gave a wonderful exhibition. It's too bad they didn‚Äôt win after rising to such great heights. I‚Äôm thoroughly satisfied with their play. \\"We were in the worst physical condition we have been in the season and I am still wondering how some of them stayed in there as well as they did. These boys certainly are fighters and they‚Äôve got plenty of guts. It's hard to beat that kind of team.\\" Bryant wrote in his autobiography Bear: My Hard Life & Good Times As Alabama's Head Coach, published in 1974: \\"The night before the game I went out into the country and puked my guts out. My big chance. All I really had to do was give them that lineup. Instead I coached a 7-0 victory into a 7-7 tie. Kentucky didn‚Äôt have a great team. We struggled along and finally went ahead in the first half when an Irish kid named Flanagan, our tailback passed for a touchdown.\\" \\"So in the second half I didn‚Äôt let Flanagan throw any more passes. And Kentucky tied the game in the fourth quarter. Naturally I thought the officials cheated us somehow, else we‚Äôd have won. No young coach is going to believe he lost on his own merit. Preacher Franklin, who has a Coca-Cola distributorship in Birmingham now and is one of my television sponsors, was the Vanderbilt team manager, and he always had my ear.\\" \\"Preacher wanted me to go out there and kill the referee, a distinguished gentleman named Bill McMasters. Preacher had on his white coveralls and he was hopping around egging me on. He was like that. Even today when we lose old Preach thinks we got cheated.\\" \\"I had made a couple of steps towards McMasters, who was looking at me out of one eye, when Bernie Shiveley, the Kentucky athletic director, came up from behind and put his big arms around me and pulled me away. If he hadn‚Äôt I‚Äôd probably got thrown out of football before my time. I didn‚Äôt get to say a word.\\" Mickey Flanagan played for Vanderbilt in 1939‚Äì40. One of the referee's calls that must have irritated Bryant was described in The Tennessean: \\"The break that turned victory for the turned, worn-out and reeling Commodores into a tie came when the officials called a slugging penalty in the fading minutes just after Noah Mullins, Kentucky right halfback, had wiggled through the Vanderbilt line for 21 yards to place the ball only 22 yards from goal.\\" \\"Art Rebrovich, Vandy's 165-pound back, was accused of slugging and with his ejection from the game went an 11-yard penalty. Three plays later Charley Ishmael, Cat fullback who was supposed to have had a sprained ankle, shot through right guard and into the end zone for the touchdown. Hardly a hand touched him.\\" Sanders was able to come back the next week to travel to Georgia Tech. Vanderbilt finished with a 3-6-1 record including a 25-21 loss to 17th ranked Alabama. The 1941 Commodores club was 8-2 with a 7-0 upset victory over 7th ranked Alabama and was the last year for coach Bryant at Vanderbilt.

He is the second governor of Alaska born in the state after William A. Egan (1959‚Äì1966 and 1970‚Äì1974). Walker was born in Fairbanks to Frances (Park) and businessman Ed Walker; he was raised in Delta Junction and Valdez, Alaska. He obtained a J.D. degree and served as mayor, city councilor, and city attorney for Valdez, and as general counsel for the Alaska Gasline Port Authority. Walker ran for governor of Alaska in the Republican Party primary election in 2010, losing to incumbent Sean Parnell. Walker ran as an Independent in the 2014 election, merging his campaign with that of Democratic nominee Byron Mallott, who became Walker's running mate. Both candidates' prior respective running mates withdrew from the race and the Walker/Mallott ticket defeated Parnell and his running mate, former Anchorage mayor Dan Sullivan. Walker ran for reelection in 2018, but facing low polling numbers and Lieutenant Governor Mallott's resignation, he dropped out of the race on October 19, 2018, and endorsed Democrat Mark Begich. Early life and education Walker was born in Fairbanks, Alaska and raised in the small, rural interior city of Delta Junction and the port of Valdez on Prince William Sound. He was the fourth child of Alaskan pioneers Frances (Park) and Ed Walker. During World War II, Ed was an Alaskan Scout with Castner's Cutthroats in the Aleutian Islands and Frances worked on the Alaska-Canadian Highway. During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, which severely damaged Valdez, the family lost most of their personal and business possessions. At the age of 12, Walker became a janitor to help his family. Walker graduated from Valdez High School in 1969. He received his B.S. in Business Management from Lewis & Clark College in 1973 and his J.D. from the University of Puget Sound School of Law (now Seattle University School of Law) in 1983. Walker worked in his family's construction business as a carpenter, laborer, and teamster on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which helped him pay for his education. Career From 1977 to 1979, Walker served on the Valdez city council. He later was elected mayor of Valdez, serving from 1979 through 1980. At 27, he was Valdez's youngest mayor. Walker and his wife, Donna, owned a law firm; he became a prominent oil and gas attorney. The firm represented the city of Valdez and the Alaska Gasoline Port Authority. Walker \\"represented the city of Valdez in lawsuits that charged [oil] companies with lowballing the property tax valuation of the industry- owned Trans-Alaska pipeline system\\". He also attempted to build a gas pipeline in Alaska. =Governor of Alaska= 2010 election Walker challenged incumbent Governor Sean Parnell as well as Gerald L. Heikes, Merica Hlatcu, Sam Little, and Ralph Samuels in the Republican Party primary election on August 24, 2010. Walker finished second, with 33.95% of the vote, while Parnell won the nomination with 49.49%. The general election was held on November 2, 2010 and Parnell defeated his Democratic opponent, Ethan Berkowitz. 2014 election In 2013, Walker announced his intention to run in the 2014 gubernatorial election as a Republican. Later that year, he decided to run as a nonpartisan candidate instead, taking the advice and encouragement he had received prior to his 2010 campaign from former Alaska governor Wally Hickel. Walker selected Craig Fleener, a former Deputy Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, to run for lieutenant governor on his ticket. He campaigned on a centrist platform, mixing traditionally conservative and liberal positions. Walker opposed the construction of the Pebble Mine and acknowledged the existence of climate change and the need to adopt energy policies to help mitigate its harmful effects, but supported increasing oil and gas pipeline capacities and new drilling for petroleum in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also supported gun rights, a degree of state sovereignty for Alaska, and the Medicaid expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act. On September 2, 2014, Walker held a press conference with Byron Mallott, the Democratic nominee for governor, announcing that they would merge their campaigns, with Mallott replacing Fleener as Walker's running mate. Mallott's Democratic running mate, attorney and State Senator Hollis French, also stepped aside, leaving no official Democratic candidate in the election. Before their announcement the merger was met with resistance from the Alaska Republican Party, but it was ruled valid by the Alaska Supreme Court. Walker led in polls taken weeks before the November 4 general election.Election 2014: Alaska Governor, Rasmussen Reports, September 29, 2014; retrieved October 3, 2014. Parnell was widely criticized for his support of billions in unpopular tax reductions for the petrochemical industry and the development of a scandal featuring five years of alleged cover-ups of rampant sexual abuse, cronyism, corruption and whistleblower suppression in the Alaska National Guard, for which Parnell served as Commander in Chief.Jill Burke and Richard Mauer, \\"Parnell defends handling alaska national guard dysfunction, plans more firings\\", Alaska Dispatch News, October 2, 2014; retrieved October 3, 2014.Caslon Hatch, Debate draws standing-room-only crowd , KTUU, July 23, 2014; retrieved October 3, 2014. Following Election Day, the race was considered too close to call. On November 7, Walker and Mallott held a 3,165-vote lead. On November 14, after Walker and Mallott extended their lead to 4,634 votes, media outlets called the race. Two days later, Parnell conceded. Tenure Walker with President Barack Obama in 2015 Walker and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting, May 2017 Walker took the oath of office on December 1, 2014. He faced a Republican-controlled legislature, but the Republican majorities were not enough to override a gubernatorial veto. With the Republican legislature opposed to Walker's attempts to expand Medicaid, Walker decided to use his executive authority to do so. In 2015, due to low oil prices, Alaska anticipated a $4 billion budget deficit. Budget cuts and raised taxes were proposed to reduce it. In December 2015, Walker proposed reinstating a statewide income tax as well as reducing annual payments to qualified state residents from the Alaska Permanent Fund. His June 2016 partial veto of legislation pertaining to the APF resulted in annual payments to state residents being cut by more than half. The New Yorker later wrote that this \\"deeply unpopular\\" move \\"doomed\\" Walker's chances of reelection. In July 2018, Walker signed into law a legislative ethics bill.. The bill prevented a stronger ballot measure, which would have prohibited foreign corporations from donating to statewide campaign candidates, from appearing on the fall ballot. In September 2018, the office of Anchorage District Attorney Richard K. Allen entered into a controversial plea bargain in the case of a former FAA air traffic controller who allegedly kidnapped a native Alaskan woman, choked her until she passed out and then masturbated over her. In response to citizen outrage at the reduced sentence, Walker issued a statement saying that the sentence was insufficient and that he would propose legislation making unwanted contact with semen a sex crime. Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott resigned on October 16, 2018, citing \\"inappropriate comments\\" that he and Walker did not detail. A new lieutenant governor, Alaska Health and Social Services Commissioner Valerie Davidson, was sworn in. 2018 election Walker sought reelection in 2018. On October 19, 2018, facing low polling numbers, he suspended his campaign and endorsed the Democratic candidate, Mark Begich. Personal life Before becoming governor and moving to Juneau, Walker and his wife Donna resided in Anchorage. As of 2017, the couple had two sons, two daughters, and five grandchildren.Biography, Governor of Alaska. Retrieved November 15, 2017.

Pikin Santi is situated upstream from Pinatjaimi and Lantiwei, and downstream from Tamarin. It lies in the vicinity of the Buku creek and should therefore be close to the ruins , which as of yet have not been identified.  History  Like all Ndyuka villages in the Cottica River area, Pikin Santi was settled somewhere in the early 19th century, when the peace treaty concluded between the Ndyuka and the Dutch colonial authorities in 1760 allowed Maroons to move to the plantation colony without running the risk of being caught by colonial military forces. The Ndyuka settled logging camps in the Cottica area, and lived off the profits of selling wood. The people of Pikin Santi belong to the matrilineal clans or lo of Pinasi and Piika, which are both members of the Mi√°fiyabakaa federation, and originally stem from the Aduwataa area on the Tapanahony River. The Dutch anthropologist Andr√© K√∂bben conducted anthropological field work in the Cottica area in the 1960s. He was based in the village of Langa Uku further upstream. During the Surinamese Interior War, Pikin Santi was attacked by the Suriname National Army. Subsequently, the village was almost completely abandoned, with most of its residents fleeing to either French Guiana or the Surinamese capital of Paramaribo. A few families under the leadership of Captain Kodyo remained in bush camps near the Buku creek until the end of the war.  Education  Pikin Santi does not have a school of its own, and all school-going children are transported daily by river canoe to the primary school in the former Catholic mission station of Tamarin.  Transportation  Transport is provided by boat taxis operated by the Nationaal Vervoerbedrijf (NVB) and Scheepvaartmaatschappij Suriname (SMS) at regular intervals, departing from Moengo.

Raised in poverty, Bateman came with his family to Illinois at a young age then earned his way into Illinois College. After graduating, he again struggled to make ends meet before an anonymous donor sent him a large sum of money. He used it to establish a private school in St. Louis, Missouri. He was later elected superintendent of schools in Morgan County, Illinois, then served as Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction (1859‚Äì63, 1865‚Äì1875). He resigned to become president of Knox College. Late in his life, he published an encyclopedia of the state. Bateman was an associate of Abraham Lincoln and is the source of a controversial account of his religious views. Biography Newton Bateman was born in Bridgeton, New Jersey on July 27, 1822. His father was a weaver who struggled with the growth of industrialization. He moved the family west when Bateman was eleven. His mother died of Asiatic cholera on their way to their new home in Meredosia, Illinois. The family continued to struggle through poverty. To help support the family, Bateman took a job as an errand-boy for a prominent jurist in Jacksonville, Illinois. He fell in love with the jurist's daughter, but was not of proper social class to ask her hand in marriage. However, this inspired Bateman to pursue an education. Bateman cut timber to raise money for schooling. He then attended the preparatory department of Illinois College before matriculating there in 1839. Bateman's classmates appreciated his sense of humor. He taught his first class while studying there, a Latin course for the preparatory department. Bateman graduated in June 1843, intending to become a Presbyterian minister. He briefly studied at Lane Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, but was forced to drop out due to a lack of funds. He then worked for a book agency, selling maps, but again fell into poverty. An anonymous donor sent Bateman some money and he used the funds to build a private school in northern St. Louis, Missouri, in 1845. Although he continued to struggle financially, he earned a reputation as a local leader in education. In 1847, the University of Missouri hired Bateman as a professor of mathematics. When Jacksonville, Illinois, established a free school in its west district in 1861, it named Bateman its superintendent. He soon became school commissioner of Morgan County, Illinois, in Jacksonville. While there, he joined the state teacher's association and advocated for the creation of the Illinois Industrial University and the Illinois State Normal University. He was named vice president of the Illinois Teachers' Association in 1855 and edited its publication, the Illinois Teacher. He became the publications sole editor in 1858 and was named superintendent of the Jacksonville Female Academy. The Republican Party nominated Bateman for the office of Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction. Bateman was elected and took office in January 1859. In his first term, he ensured that new schools must receive a state certificate to open. He was re-elected to another two-year term in 1861. He was defeated in a re-election bid in 1862, but was successful in another run in 1864. He would then hold the office for another decade. In his final year, he published an 83-page report suggesting a selection of books for school libraries. Bateman was offered the presidency of several colleges during his terms as state superintendent. In 1875, he agreed to assume the presidency of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. He led the school for the next eighteen years. From 1877 to 1891, he was a member of the Illinois Board of Health. In failing health, he resigned in 1893, receiving a position as professor emeritus of the school. He taught only a singly class, spending most of his time compiling the Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois. Bateman married Sarah Dayton in 1850, though she died on May 16, 1857. They had a son, Clifford Rush, and one daughter. He married Annie N. Tyler in 1859; they had two daughters together and adopted an orphaned niece. She died in 1877. Bateman died in Galesburg on October 21, 1897. He was buried there in Hope Cemetery. He is the namesake of Newton Bateman Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois. Bateman and Lincoln Newton Bateman was a friend and political ally of Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln would visit the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, on political business, he would stay in the room next to the superintendent's. Lincoln jokingly referred to Bateman as his \\"little friend\\", as Bateman was short and Lincoln was tall. The two became close during a seven-month stay by Lincoln in 1860 during his presidential candidacy. An interaction between Bateman in Lincoln is of interest to biographers because of the way it portrays Lincoln's religious beliefs. When Josiah Gilbert Holland was seeking material for his Life of Lincoln, he interviewed Bateman. According to Bateman, Lincoln asked him into his office one day to discuss a political canvass of Springfield. The canvass showed the intended votes of all Springfield voters, and Lincoln was vexed: > Here are twenty-three, ministers, of different denominations, and all of > them are against me but three; are here are a great many prominent members > of the churches, a very large majority of whom are against me. Mr. Bateman, > I am not Christian‚ÄîGod knows I could be one‚Äîbut I have carefully read the > Bible, and I do not so understand this book [the New Testament]. These men > will know that I am for freedom in the territories, freedom everywhere as > far as the Constitution and laws will permit, and that my opponents are for > slavery. They know this, and yet, with this book in their hands, in the > light of which human bondage cannot live a moment, they are going to vote > against me. I do not understand it at all. Lincoln paused, then paced around the room. He then continued: > I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see the > storm coming, and I know that His hand is in it. If He has a place and work > for me‚Äîand I think He has‚ÄîI believe I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is > everything. I know I am right because I know liberty is right, for Christ > teaches it, and Christ is God. I have told them that a house divided against > itself cannot stand, and so Christ and reason say the same; and they will > find it so. Douglas don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down, > but God cares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with God's help I shall > not fail. I may not see the end; but it will come, and I shall be > vindicated; and these men will find that they have not read their Bibles > aright. Holland's Life of Lincoln used this story to color Lincoln as a religious man. However, as soon as 1872, the story faced criticism. Ward Hill Lamon, a close associate of Lincoln, dismissed the story as inconsistent with Lincoln's character. Likewise, Lincoln's former law partner William Herndon found the story hard to believe even though he approved of the rest of Holland's biography. Herndon sought out Bateman and the two discussed the interview with Holland. Bateman repudiated that Lincoln claimed that \\"Christ is God\\", but supported Holland's interpretation. Herndon wrote about the discussion: > On my word, the world may take for granted that Holland is wrong; that he > does not state Mr. Lincoln's views correctly. Mr. Bateman, if correctly > represented in Holland's Life of Lincoln, is the only man, the sole and only > man, who dare say that Lincoln believed in Jesus as the Christ of God, as > the Christian world represents. Bateman largely maintained a public silence on the issue. When Isaac N. Arnold asked Bateman about the incident when writing his The Life of Abraham Lincoln, Bateman replied that it was \\"substantially correct\\" without further elaboration. Bateman's interview with Lincoln is generally not included in modern biographies.

Its use had been abandoned in most countries by the end of the 20th century. Beheading is a legal method of execution in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, and was reportedly used in 2001 in Iran according to Amnesty International, where it is no longer in use.\\"Beheading was last used as a method of execution in 2001....beheading is no longer in use.\\" Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide, Death Penalty Worldwide: Iran Some Muslims still use beheading as a punishment in other countries such as France . In recent times, non-state Jihadist organizations such as ISIS and Tawhid and Jihad have used beheading as a method of killing captives. Since 2002, they have circulated beheading videos as a form of terror and propaganda. Their actions have been condemned by other militant and terrorist groups, as well as by mainstream Islamic scholars and organizations. Beheading: background and context The use of beheading for punishment continued well into the 20th century in both Islamic and non- Islamic nations. When done properly, it was once considered a humane and honorable method of execution. Beheading in Islamic scripture There is a debate as to whether the Quran discusses beheading.Rachel Saloom (2005), \\"Is Beheading Permissible under Islamic Law ‚Äì Comparing Terrorist Jihad and the Saudi Arabian Death Penalty\\", UCLA Journal of International Law and Foreign Affairs, vol. 10, pp. 221‚Äì49. Two surahs could potentially be used to provide a justification for beheading in the context of war: > When the Lord inspired the angels (saying) I am with you. So make those who > believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who > disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger. (8:12) > Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the > necks until, when ye have routed them, making fast of bonds; and afterward > either grace or ransom 'til the war lay down its burdens. (47:4) Among classical commentators, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi interprets the last sentence of 8:12 to mean striking at the enemies in any way possible, from their head to the tips of their extremities. Al-Qurtubi reads the reference to striking at the necks as conveying the gravity and severity of the fighting. For al-Qurtubi, al-Tabari, and Ibn Kathir, the expression indicates the brevity of the act, as it is confined to battle and is not a continuous command. Some commentators have suggested that terrorists use alternative interpretations of these surahs to justify beheading captives, however there is agreement among scholars that they have a different meaning. Furthermore, according to Rachel Saloom, surah 47:4 goes on to recommend generosity or ransom when waging war, and it refers to a period when Muslims were persecuted and had to fight for their survival.  Beheading in Islamic law  Beheading was the normal method of executing the death penalty under classical Islamic law. It was also, together with hanging, one of the ordinary methods of execution in the Ottoman Empire. Currently, Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world which uses decapitation within its Islamic legal system. The majority of executions carried out by the Wahhabi government of Saudi Arabia are public beheadings,Janine di Giovanni, \\"When It Comes to Beheadings, ISIS has Nothing Over Saudi Arabia\\", Newsweek, 14 October 2014.Russell Goldman, \\"Saudi Arabia's Beheading of a Nanny Followed Strict Procedures\\", abcnews.com, 11 January 2013. which usually cause mass gatherings but are not allowed to be photographed or filmed. According to Amnesty, beheading have been carried out by state authorities in Iran as recently as 2001, but as of 2014 is no longer in use.\\"Death Penalty Database: Iran\\", deathpenaltyworldwide.org, Cornell Law School, accessed 13 June 2016. It is also a legal form of execution in Qatar and Yemen, but the punishment has been suspended in those countries.  Historical occurrences  * The Islamic followers of Mohammed executed the men of the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza for an alleged treaty violation, with several hundred killed in 627. * After the Battle of Hattin (1187), Saladin personally beheaded Raynald of Ch√¢tillon; a Christian knight who served in the Second Crusade and organized attacks against Islam's two holiest cities. *Forces of the Ottoman Empire invaded and laid siege to the city of Otranto and its citadel in 1480. According to a traditional account, after capture, more than 800 of its inhabitants ‚Äì who refused to convert to Islam ‚Äì were beheaded. They are known as the \\"Martyrs of Otranto\\". Historicity of this account has been questioned by modern scholars. * Muhammad Ahmad declared himself Mahdi in 1880 and led Jihad against the Ottoman Empire and their British allies. He and his followers beheaded opponents, Christian and Muslim alike including the British general Charles Gordon.Byron Farwell, Prisoners of the Mahdi (New York & London: W.W. Norton & Company, 1989), pp. 156-7. Modern use by non-state actors Modern instances of Islamist beheading date at least to the 1990s. In First Chechen War (1994‚Äì96), the beheading of Yevgeny Rodionov, a Russian soldier who refused to convert to Islam, led some within the Russian Orthodox Church to venerate him as a martyr. \\"Boy soldier who died for faith made 'saint'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 24 January 2004. In 1997, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria beheaded 80-200 villagers in Benthalia. The 2002 beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl by Al-Qaeda member Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan drew international attention enhanced by the release of a beheading video. Revulsion in the Muslim community led al Qaeda to abandon video beheadings. Groups in Iraq led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Tawhid and Jihad and later ISIL, continued the practice.\\"The Terrorist as Auteur\\" Since 2002, they have been mass circulating beheading videos as a form of terror and propaganda. One of al-Zarqawi's most publicized murders was that of American Nick Berg. Since 2004 insurgents in South Thailand began to sow fear in attacks where men and women of the local Buddhist minority were beheaded. On 18 July 2005 two militants entered a teashop in South Thailand, shot Lek Pongpla, a Buddhist cloth vendor, beheaded him and left the head outside of the shop. The founder of Bridges TV, a Muslim cable channel in originally based in Buffalo, NY that aimed to combat negative perceptions of Muslims that were allegedly dominating mainstream media coverage, beheaded his wife in 2009 in the offices of Bridges TV. According to Peter R. Neumann, Director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London, viral beheading videos are intended, and are at least somewhat effective, as a recruiting tool for jihad among both Western and Middle Eastern youth. From Daniel Pearl to James Foley: The modern tactic of Islamist beheadings, Adam Taylor, 21 August 2014, Washington Post/Chicago Tribune. Islamic State steps up propaganda videos, beheading another captive, Videotaped atrocities in an attempt to spread fear are nothing new for IS. But it appears to be stepping up its propaganda as world powers start to engage in halting its spread, Dan Murphy, 29 August 2014, Christian Science Monitor. Other observers argue that while Al Qaeda initially used beheading as a publicity tool, it later decided that they caused Muslims to recoil from Islamism and that although ISIS/IS is enthusiastically deploying beheading as a tactic in 2014, it, too, may find that the tactic backfires. Why Beheading Videos Are Back With ISIS, and Why They Went Away, Katie Zavadski, 21 August 2014, New York Magazine. Timothy R. Furnish, as Assistant Professor of Islamic History, contrasts the Saudi government executions, conforming to standards that minimize pain, with the non-state actors who have \\"chosen a slow, torturous sawing method to terrorize the Western audience.\\" =ISIL beheading incidents= In January 2015, a copy of an ISIL penal code surfaced describing the penalties it enforces in areas under its control, including beheadings. Beheading videos have been frequently posted by ISIL members to social media. Several of the videoed beheadings were conducted by Mohammed Emwazi, whom the media had referred to as \\"Jihadi John\\" before his identification. The beheadings received wide coverage around the world and attracted international condemnation. Political scientist Max Abrahms posited that ISIL may be using well-publicized beheadings as a means of differentiating itself from Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and identifying itself with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the al-Qaeda member who beheaded Daniel Pearl. Beheadings represent a small proportion of a larger total of people killed following capture by ISIL. Condemnation by Muslims Mainstream Islamic scholars and organizations around the world, as well as militant and terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Al-Qaeda have condemned the practice. Impact on war coverage Some analysts have argued that the beheadings of journalists and aid workers, along with other abductions and executions of independent observers in Syrian war zones, have forced international media to rely exclusively on reporting which is directly or indirectly influenced by rebel and opposition groups and in this way allowed the latter to dictate the coverage of events in areas under their control.

The term was coined by Prof. Ramesh Raskar. The technique has been developed as an alternative to light field photography that requires no specialized equipment. Examples of epsilon photography include focal stack photography, High dynamic range (HDR) photography, lucky imaging, multi-image panorama stitching and confocal stereo. The common thread for all the aforementioned imaging techniques is that multiple images are captured in order to produce a composite image of higher quality, such as richer color information, wider-field of view, more accurate depth map, less noise/blur and greater resolution. Since Epsilon photography at times may require the capture of hundreds of images, recently an alternative called Compressive Epsilon Photography was proposed where one captures only a select few images instead and generates the rest of the images of the stack by making use of prior information about the scene or relationship among the images in the stack. The reconstructed stack of images can be used as before for novel photography applications such as light field recovery, depth estimation, refocusing and synthetic aperture photography.

The National Young Composers Challenge 501(c)(3) was incorporated in 2008 by Steve Goldman and funded by the Goldman Charitable Trust.  Orchestra Composition Awards  Starting in 2005, the NYCC began holding competitions for young composers between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Submissions are accepted in two categories: Chamber Ensemble (2 to 6 instruments), and Full Orchestra. Three submissions are typically selected in each category. Each of the winning ensemble composers is awarded a $500 honorarium, and each full orchestra composer is awarded a $1000 honorarium. Professional recordings of the performed submissions are made available to the composer and to the public on the NYCC website www.YoungComposersChallenge.org in order to encourage more interest in orchestral composition by young composers, and to help launch the composition careers of the winning students. Initially, submissions were limited to young composers living in the Central Florida area, with the winning compositions performed by the Central Florida Youth Orchestra.  The Composium  Starting in 2007, the range of submissions was extended to allow submissions from young composers living anywhere in the southeast United States, with the winning compositions performed by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra in a public event called \\"The Composium\\". In 2010, the competition was expanded to the entire United States. The purpose of the Composium is to involve and educate the public in the process of new music creation in order to build greater understanding and support for symphony orchestras and orchestral music. The Composium is part concert, part rehearsal, part recording session, and part seminar. At the Composiums, winning compositions are sight-read, rehearsed, discussed, and recorded front of a live audience. In 2010, the geographic range of submissions was extended to include the entire United States. In 2013, two Composiums were held: one in Orlando, Florida with winning compositions performed by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, and one in the San Francisco Bay Area with winning compositions performed by the Marin Symphony. In Fall of 2015 a Composium will be held at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando, Florida.  Orchestra Composition Workshops  Since 2003, the NYCC has presented free all-day composition workshops for up to 150 young musicians, featuring lectures by professional composers and live demonstrations of orchestration techniques by professional chamber ensembles. Workshops have been held at the University of Central Florida and Full Sail University in Central Florida, and at San Domenico School in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Funding  Primary funding for the NYCC is provided by the Goldman Charitable foundation. Additional in-kind sponsors include the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the University of Central Florida, Rollins College, and Full Sail University.

The school opened in 1972. Dyett is a part of the Chicago Public Schools system and is named for American violinist and music educator Walter Henri Dyett (1901‚Äì1969). The school became an arts high school for the 2016‚Äì17 school year. History Dyett's main entrance, 2015 Dyett first opened in September 1972 as a neighborhood middle school. Connected by a tunnel to the Dyett Recreation Center, it was built under a joint governance agreement with the Chicago Park District, under which the community had access to the recreation center when school was not in session. The recreation center's pool provided a particularly important community asset, because no other public pools were available in Bronzeville. At the direction of CPS head Paul Vallas, the school became a high school in 1999. Two years later, the recreation center was closed to the public. In contrast to the limited-admission King College Prep that was opened nearby at the same time, Dyett was deliberately starved of resources, suffering \\"over a decade of CPS disinvestment and destabilization.\\" By 2011, only 19% of students in the school's attendance area were attending Dyett, with most parents choosing to send their students to less under-resourced schools. By 2012, Dyett students were deprived of all advanced placement classes and had to take art and physical education classes online. Dyett's dropout rate rose over the years, hitting a high of 81% during the 2009‚Äì10 school year. Despite persistent opposition from parents and community leaders arguing that CPS had set Dyett up to fail, the CPS board voted to close Dyett in 2012. The closure took place as a teach-out, with the school closing after the students who were freshmen in 2011-2012 had graduated. During this phaseout period, members of the school community protested continuously, with several Dyett supporters being arrested for refusing to leave Chicago City Hall and 36 students filing a federal civil rights complaint against CPS. In 2013 Dyett supporters organized the Coalition to Revitalize Dyett, presenting detailed plans to convert Dyett to a school focused on \\"global leadership and green technology.\\" CPS nonetheless closed the school in the spring of 2015, after graduating a final class of 12 students. During late‚ÄìAugust through mid‚ÄìSeptember in 2015, a group of education activists went on a hunger strike for over 19 days in an attempt to save the school, which was the only remaining open-access school serving Bronzeville. In September 2015, CPS announced that the school would open again as Dyett High School For The Arts, an open enrollment arts-focused neighborhood high school for the 2016‚Äì17 school year. Bronzeville resident and Michele Clark Magnet High School principal Beulah McLoyd was picked by the school board to serve as principal of Dyett in October 2015. The re-envisioned school also featured an innovation lab to offer training in technology for the Bronzeville/Washington Park community and nearby schools. Athletics Dyett competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and was a member of Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The school's sport teams are known as the Eagles. The boys' basketball were regional champions in 2006‚Äì07.

The headset was released on November 27, 2015. When in use, a compatible Samsung Galaxy device acts as the headset's display and processor, while the Gear VR unit itself acts as the controller, which contains the field of view, as well as a custom inertial measurement unit, or IMU, for rotational tracking, which connects to the smartphone via USB-C or micro-USB. The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on. The Gear VR was first announced on September 3, 2014. To allow developers to create content for the Gear VR and to allow VR and technology enthusiasts to get early access to the technology, Samsung had released two innovator editions of the Gear VR before the consumer version. Overview The Samsung Gear VR is designed to work with Samsung‚Äôs flagship smartphones. Currently supported are Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy A8/A8+ (2018) and Samsung Galaxy S9/Galaxy S9+. The Galaxy Note10, Note10+, Note10 5G, and the Note10+ 5G are not supported by the Gear VR. The focus can be adjusted using the wheel at the top of the headset. A trackpad is located on the right of the device, home and back buttons are located just above it. Volume can be adjusted through the volume rockers also found on the right hand side. A USB-C port is located on the bottom of the headset. Some of the major goals Samsung set for this project regarding hardware were: that their headset could support MTP (Motion to Photon) latency less than 20 ms; the optimization of hardware and kernel; and also to create Galaxy Note 4‚Äôs QHD display that enables high-resolution rendering in the headset. The lenses field of view are 96¬∞ for the first three models and 101¬∞ for the R323. Oculus Home is the main facility to download and use content on the Samsung Gear VR. Oculus Home is also the main line for software distribution on the Gear VR. The primary appeal of the Gear VR is for mobile virtual-reality based gaming and simulations, however, recent interest is growing in the effective use of this device in science and medical education.  History  Although the Samsung Gear VR consumer edition was released in November 2015, Samsung had obtained a patent on a HMD (Head Mounted Display) in January 2005. This was one of the first ideas of using a mobile phone as the display for a HMD. However, mobile phone technology at the time the patent was submitted limited the degree of quality and performance possible. Samsung continued to research VR and HMD internally. With the release of the Galaxy S4 in 2013, Samsung formed an official team dedicated to developing a virtual reality based device that would work with a smartphone. While this team developed multiple different prototypes, the performance and display (despite the Galaxy S4 having a Full HD display) were not yet up to standards. In 2014 Samsung partnered with Oculus (the creators of another well-known virtual reality device, the Oculus Rift) to help with the development. The Samsung Gear VR was unveiled during the Samsung press conference at IFA Berlin on September 3, 2014 (along with a smartphone capable of running it, the Galaxy Note 4). = Hardware editions = left The first edition of Samsung's Gear VR, the SM-R320, was released in December 2014. This version was only compatible with the Galaxy Note 4. This edition was mainly released for developers so they could get an understanding of how the device worked and so they could create content which would be ready for the official release of the consumer version of the device. It also gave the chance for VR/technology enthusiasts to gain early access to the technology. The second edition of Samsung‚Äôs Gear VR, the SM-R321, was released in March 2015. This device supports only the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge. A micro USB port is also added, to provide additional power to the docked device, as well as a small fan inside to prevent the lens fogging. The next edition, SM-R322, was simply referred to as the Samsung Gear VR. It was released on November 20, 2015. Pre-orders for the device went live on Amazon, Bestbuy and Samsung on November 10, 2015 and the device was sold out on the day of release. This edition has again a few minor changes compared to the previous iterations. First of all this edition supports six Samsung Galaxy devices so far: the S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+, Note 5, S7, and S7 edge. It is also 19% lighter than the previous Innovator Edition, it has improved ergonomics and a redesigned touchpad for easier navigation. The SM-R323 model was released alongside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, and features minor changes, including an improved field of view, increased cushioning, a flat trackpad, and changes to the cover and body of the device to reduce glare. The model also utilizes USB-C connector instead of USB Micro-B so that it could be connected to the Note 7. The port is also capable of data transfer.

Underwood was raised near Yucca Valley in California while Costelloe came from an artistic household in London. They rose to prominence following the release of their second album June Gloom which received airplay on BBC 6Music in 2013. Support for the band from grass roots movements and Lauren Laverne of 6Music have seen the band invited to tour Europe with Depeche Mode in 2014. On 1 September 2016 they announced they had decided to break up.  Lights Out  2011's Lights Out 12 track LP is a collection of folk and grunge folk songs and was released without a drum or bass track. Produced by Underwood and notable producer Dean Reid who had worked with Nelly Furtado and Lana Del Rey the boy / girl folk simplicity with twin guitars and harmonies produce what Sam Wolfson of NME called \\"More grungy than gooey\\" and saw the release of 3 video singles \\"Talk\\", \\"Chair\\" and then followed by the haunting \\"Homework\\". While \\"Talk\\" became a single release in its own right, it was \\"Homework\\" that emerged as the duet's first writing attempts together.  June Gloom  Pic from side of stage from Left, Mel Rigby, K.C. Underwood, Huw Webb and Alice Costelloe 2013's June Gloom was released on June 4th and featured regularly on BBC 6Music radio. Its lead single Swapping Spit was accompanied by a live video clip all in VHS taping style. The heavy, grunge guitars of Costelloe and Underwood coupled with the heavily compressed explosive drumming of new addition Mel Rigby saw a distinct change from 2011's Lights Out. Bass guitarist Huw Webb provided a musical shadow to Costelloe's rhythm guitar work and with Rigby brought the band from a dual guitar folk duet to an explosive wall of sound live band of dynamic shifts and crafted songwork. Heather Phares of allmusic reviewed June Gloom and wrote \\"Here and throughout the album, Big Deal is nostalgic not just for the sounds of the '90s, but for the best -- and worst -- parts of being in love.\\" Notable live gigs in support of June Gloom include July 13 at Herk-De-Stad'd Rok Herk and London's Love Box on the 20th of July and Secret Garden Party in Cambridge on the 27th of July. With a doubling of personnel on stage, live performances at this time strongly acknowledged the shoe gaze influences of Underwood and Costelloe with the band minimally interacting with the audience. Live performances were also reminiscent of influences of Pixies wherein the polished June Gloom album was recreated live with the assistance of multiple effects (mostly from Underwood) and translated from studio to live successfully.  Say Yes  Released 10th June 2016, \\"Say Yes\\" was Big Deal's third and final album. Created during the break up of Costelloe and Underwood's relationship, the production of the album was also marred by losing all their demos when Underwood's laptop was stolen at a house party and leaving their record label Mute. The project was self-funded and was picked up by FatCat Records with most of the record finished, and to generally favourable reviews. When the band unexpectedly split in September 2016, their tour and festival appearances were cancelled.Kacey Underwood's pedal line up for 2013's June Gloom  References  Category:American pop rock music groups Category:American new wave musical groups Category:American synth-pop groups ","title":"Big Deal (band)"},{"id":"43732248","text":"Girolamo Gigli Girolamo Gigli (or Gerolamo; October 14, 1660 ‚Äì January 4, 1722) was an Italian writer and playwright. Biography Born in Siena to the Nenci family, he was adopted by an uncle, from whom he took the surname, Gigli. He married young to Laurenzia Perfetti, with whom he had twelve children. In 1698 he taught at the University of Pavia and later in that of Siena, as Tuscan professor of Literature. He was a regular visitor to the Accademia degli Intronati (he also became secretary), where he was nicknamed \\"L'Economico\\" (\\"The Budget\\").Guido Davico Bonino, Roberta Turchi (1987) Il teatro italiano: La commedia del Settecento, T. 1, Volume 4, p.3 Works Gigli adapted French comedy with a lively and spontaneous humor. For example, Il Don Pilone, ovvero il bacchettone falso (1711) is an adaptation of Il Tartufo by Moli√®re. Here, Gigli uses the language of Siena to make a witty satire of personalities of the era. In La sorellina di don Pilone (1712), Gigli teases his own family, especially his wife. The same year Gigli wrote Il Gazzettino e Avvisi ideali, mocking characters related to the academic, religious, and courtly worlds. In addition to plays, he also wrote some forty musical compositions. Gigli also engaged in historical research and linguistic diversity. His most notable historical work is the Diario Senese (or Sanese), a two-volume work published posthumously in 1723 by his son Ludwig. In the Diario, Gigli collected \\"outstanding things sacred and profane that would illustrate the annals of Siena\\", ordered day-to-day; therefore containing much historical information from previous centuries concerning the customs, traditions, and institutions of Siena. In 1717 he published all the writings of St. Catherine of Siena, but in farcical and funny language: the so-called Vocabolario Cateriniano. This questioning of the Florentine language, in addition to its opinion concerning the superiority of Florence over Siena, helped give rise to the controversy with the Accademia della Crusca, from which he was expelled. Gigli never disavowed his views of language, and was therefore sent into exile, under pressure from the same Accademia della Crusca. His Vocabolario Cateriniano was burned at Florence in Piazza Sant Apollinare, on September 9, 1717. Gigli then had to move, first to Viterbo and then to Rome, before returning to Siena in the final period of his life. However, due to his economic and social disgrace, he decided to return to Rome, where he died in 1722. In recent years the Accademia della Crusca has decided to republish Gigli's Vocabulario Cateriniano. In 1707 it was published in Siena with a dedication to the Grand Duke Cosimo III \\"The life of the seraphic bride of Jesus Christ St. Catherine of Siena, now faithfully translated from the Latin Legend who compiled the B. Raymond of Capua, her confessor for Mr. Canon Bernardino Pecci Academic Enthroned\\".

It is a mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction, which was formerly classified in the form class Hyphomycetes of the form phylum Deuteromycota (also often called Fungi Imperfecti). M. brunneum has been isolated from Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and soil samples, but a commercially developed isolate (below) has proved virulent against Hemiptera and Thysanoptera.  Standard isolate and characteristics  Bischoff et al.[1] state: \\"There is no viable ex-type culture for M. brunneum Petch. However ARSEF 2107 (from Oregon, USA) is considered an authentic strain because the taxon's author, Petch, identified it and we designate it here as an ex-epitype. ... an ex-epitype (BPI 878297) derived from a living culture (ARSEF 1914) is designated for this taxon.\\" Metarhizium brunneum is the most basal lineage in the clade called 'PARB' in which it appears impossible to differentiate isolates of M. brunneum from M. anisopliae, on morphological characteristics alone (with the exception of the presumptive colour mutant ARSEF 2107). Conidia typically measure 4.5‚Äì8.0 Œºm long x 2.0‚Äì3.0 Œºm diameter: similar to several other Metarhizuim species. Petch designated a type collection from the Philippines, which he described as turning brown in mature colonies. This colour variant may occur regularly in nature based on the fact that Petch had identified a number of isolates as M. brunneum from geographically distant locations. However it is important to note that the majority of M. brunneum isolates examined by Bischoff et al. were olive-green in colour (similar to M. anisopliae), rather than the buff and tan pigmentation described for the type specimen and the ex-epitype cultures, respectively.

The mill has been restored to working order. It is listed as a Rijksmonument. History The mill was built in 1857 to drain the Noorderpolder at Dronryp. A mill had previously been built on that site in 1833. For many years, a diesel engine located in the mill had worked the Archimedes' screw. In latter years, the mill stood derelict. The Original mill on the site now occupied by De Rentmeester was De Kooi (). It was built in 1833 to drain the Zuidoosterderpolder. The mill burnt down on 25 March 1969. The mill was moved here in 1981 by millwright Tacoma of Stiens. The mill's restoration was celebrated with an official opening ceremony on 29 October 1982. A further restoration took place in 1995. The name De Rentmeester was given to the mill at its new location. A new Archimedes' screw was fitted on 1 May 2012. On 23 February 2013, a bolt in the brake broke, and the mill was nearly set on fire by friction between the brake and brake wheel. The mill is owned by the Stichting Molens in Menaldumadeel.

The sails are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast by Gietijzer H. J. Koning of Foxham, Groningen in 1907. It also carries the brake wheel which has 47 cogs. This drives the wallower (24 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft there are two crown wheels The upper crown wheel, which has 31 cogs drives an Archimedes' screw via a crown wheel. The lower crown wheel, which has 32 cogs is carried on the axle of an Archimedes' screw, which was used to drain the polder. The axle of the screw is diameter and long. The screw is diameter.

He is a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Davis. His fields of expertise have been in Autecology and synecology of plants and vegetation in stressful environments, including marine strand, tidal salt marsh, vernal pools, warm desert scrub, mixed evergreen forest, oak forest, and montane conifer forest. Research conducted in Alta and Baja California along the Pacific coast of North America, on the Gulf of Mexico coast, in northwestern Argentina, in southern Australia, in coastal and arid parts of Israel, in mountains of central-to-northern Spain, in mountains of the Canary Islands, and in mountains of Coast Range and Sierra Nevada of California.  Career  Barbour worked at UCDavis from 1967, initially as a faculty member in the Botany Department, then moving to Plant Biology, Environmental Horticulture, and Plant Sciences, and retired in 2007. His teaching and research experiences were in introductory plant biology, plant ecology, forest ecosystems, fire ecology, plant communities of California, and concepts and methods in plant community ecology. He co-authored textbooks for introductory plant biology, plant ecology, and the vegetation of California and North America. His research was on the vegetation of such habitats as coastal dune, tidal salt marsh, montane conifer forest, vernal pool, Mediterranean-climate woodland, and warm desert scrub. His focus was on determining how vegetation or dominant species tolerate and respond to particular environmental stresses such as salt spray, soil salinity, competition, snow pack, summer drought and heat, freezing temperatures, fog, soil structure, and wildfire. Some of his research was done abroad in Argentina, Australia, Baja California, Israel, and Spain.

Its ideology was a mix of different streams of thought, including green anarchism. History The group was formed in Spring of 1969 by two individuals using the pseudonyms Keddy and Kriss. Preparations for the founding had begun the previous year. Many new members soon joined, and the group began holding regular meetings in Lund's Book Caf√© and the \\"AF Castle\\" in Lundag√•rd, the Academic Association's building. It was part of a wave of newly formed anarchist groups in Sweden, formed in the wake of the May 1968 events in France and the world-wide protests of 1968 - others were created in Ume√•, J√∂nk√∂ping, Stockholm, and V√§xj√∂. The group published Lund's Free Press (). Activities were centered around a housing collective on Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan, where reprints of classic anarchist literature were published. The heavily activistic Anarchist Group was involved in a large number of actions, gaining influence despite its relatively low number of members. Activities that the organization was involved in include - among others - three occupations for the establishment of an all-activity community center, prisoner support, protests against the South African Apartheid regime, opposition to the annual nationalistic Charles XII March, and various environmental campaigns. The group also participated in several peace movement campaigns, including opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War and opposition to the system of conscription. Its most well-known involvement was in a campaign against the political psychiatric system, especially an attack on 30 January 1970 when the Forensic Psychiatric Clinic in Lund was burnt down just prior to its opening. Dissolution Lund's Anarchist Group remained active until 1973, when it together with MUSK (Malm√∂ Ungsocialistiska Klubb) in connection to the general election that year published the comic book Valhoppet and a politically themed deck of playing cards, the De L√∂jliga Partierna (\\"The Silly Parties\\").

The name is sometimes also transliterated as Yoon, Yune, Yiun, or Youn. The Chinese character Â∞π is also used for the surname Y«ên in China and Do√£n in Vietnam. The Korean surname Yun or Youn has no relations with the Do√£n surname of Vietnam or Yin of China. According to the 2000 census, 948,600 people had the surname in South Korea.  Clans and history  = Papyeong clan = The Papyeong (ÌååÌèâ/Âù°Âπ≥) Yun clan, which has its seat in Papyeong-myeon, Paju City, is the most well-known and largest Yun clan. The 2000 South Korean census found 221,433 households claiming membership in the Papyeong clan, with a total population of 713,947. The clan's founding ancestor is General Yun Sin-dal, who assisted Wanggeon in founding the Goryeo Dynasty. Yoon Gwan was a renowned general in the Goryeo Dynasty. He helped form the Byeolmuban forces to fight and defeat the Jurchen tribes in 1107. In 2002 a mummified woman with an unborn fetus was discovered in the tomb of Yun Jeong-jeong, a member of the Papyeong Yun clan. It is believed she was the granddaughter of Yun Won-hyung, the brother of Queen Munjeong. Several Papyeong Yun women became queens during the early Joseon Dynasty, they include Queen Jeonghyeon, Queen Jeonghui, Queen Munjeong and Queen Janggyeong. = Haepyeong clan = Last ruling Empress, Empress Sunjeong of the Korean Empire, was from another Yun clan, Haepyeong Yun. The first Haepyeong Yun was a person named Yun Jonbu (1046~1083) from the Goryeo Danasty. According to the 2000 census, 26,000 people belong to this clan. Yun Bo-seon the second president of South Korea is a distant relative of Empress Sunjeong of the Korean Empire.  Family feud  When the tomb of Yoon Gwan was rediscovered in the 18th century, it sparked a 300-year-old family feud between the Yun and Sim Clan. The reason for the feud was because a member of the Sim clan was buried uphill from Yoon Gwan's tomb, destroying part of the original tomb in the process. The feud was finally settled in 2008.

This cultural revitalization of [the] local environment does not however signify a disinterest in more distant societies. [The] appetite for other cultures and [the] need to understand them better cannot help but expand in the world of tomorrow.‚Äù From this perspective, the purple economy is universal by nature: ‚ÄúAll territories, including those less economically and technologically well-endowed, have a cultural message to share. It is a matter of giving each of them the chance to showcase what makes them unique, in a world where homogenization is a sign of devitalization.‚Äù  Surge in culture  The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society.

Scope  The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this. It differs from the cultural economy, which is sector-based. In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter- institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from UNESCO, the OECD, the International Organisation of the Francophonie, French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between purple jobs and purplifying professions: the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy Another reference document published in June 2017 mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.  Origin  The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest published on Le Monde.fr.

Connection to sustainable development  The three components of a sustainable economy The purple economy emphasizes the presence of externalities: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a common good. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for sustainable development. In fact, culture has been a whole sub- section of sustainability since the beginning. Corporate social responsibility can even be said to have originated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1966. This issue is just one of the different components of sustainable development, alongside concerns relating to the natural environment (green economy) and to the social environment (social economy).

The American Union of Associationists (AUA) was a national organization of supporters of the economic ideas of Charles Fourier (1772‚Äì1837) in the United States of America. Organized in 1846 in New York City as a federation of independent local Fourierist groups, the AUA published a weekly magazine called The Harbinger and published more than 70 books and pamphlets, which helped it to enjoy a brief moment of influence spreading the ideas of communitarianism to a circle of leading intellectuals. The failure of the Fourierist model in its various practical incarnations led to the rapid dissolution of the Fourierist movement and with it the AUA, however, and the organization rapidly atrophied as the decade of the 1840s drew to a close. The final issue of the official AUA organ, The Harbinger, was published in February 1849 and the final national meeting of the organization took place in 1851. Organizational history =Background= The 1840 publication of the book Social Destiny of Man by Albert Brisbane (1809‚Äì1890) and subsequent publication of a regular column by him in the pages of Horace Greeley's New York Tribune ushered in a period of popular enthusiasm for the ideas of Charles Fourier in the United States.Carl J. Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 2. American Fourierists were divided between the bookish advocates of \\"pure\\" Fourierism such as Brisbane, Osborne Macdaniel, and Parke Godwin ‚Äî who advocated for the establishment of very specific Fourierist \\"phalanx\\" (commune), properly funded and containing between 1600 and 1800 people ‚Äî and those who sought immediate implementation of Fourierist cooperative ideas at whatever size determined by available funds and the number of committed participants.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pp. 227-228. These practical communitarians, exemplified by George Ripley and his transcendentalist experiment near Boston called Brook Farm, initially held sway. In the years 1843 and 1844 a faddish boom saw the launch of more than two dozen Fourierism \\"Associations\\" (communal economic units) in the Northeast and Midwest. To this were added various \\"Fourierist clubs\\" scattered across the country.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pg. 227. Most of these efforts proved short-lived and by 1846 the Fourierist movement was already in retreat. Committed believers in Fourier's ideas did not see a structural cause to the mass failure of Fourierist \\"phalanxes\\" (communes) however, instead concentrating on the obvious underfinancing and haphazard operation of the first experiments in communalism. Intent on making a new start, Fourierist leaders sought to create a national organization to share ideas through publications, raise funds, and to concentrate efforts onto the formation of a single properly founded phalanx which would serve as a practical model for emulation. The American Union of Associationists (AUA) was the organization established as the mechanism for coordinating and refocusing Fourierist efforts in America. =Regional conferences= Unitarian minister George Ripley (1802-1880), whose Brook Farm was one of the most prominent communal experiments of the 1840s. Previous efforts to bring together Fourierist Associations were regional in nature and oriented towards the immediate creation of phalanxes, with three conferences taking place in 1843 and 1844 ‚Äî one each for the Midwest, New York City, and New England.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pg. 230. The so-called Western Fourier Convention, held in Pittsburgh in September 1843, was intended to concentrate the efforts of participants upon one \\"Model Western Association\\" but owing to personal jealousies, local rivalries, and fundamental philosophical differences ultimately lead to the formation of four small and impoverished experiments in the states of Ohio and Illinois.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pp. 230-231. Three of these died in the crib, with only one lasting past 1846.William Alfred Hinds, American Communities and Co-operative Colonies. Second Edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr & Co., 1908; pg. 250. The second regional gathering, held in December 1843, was held in Boston under the auspices of the Brook Farm transcendentalists. It was at this gathering that the Brook Farm principals announced their formal conversion to the ideas of Fourierism. Plans were made to coordinate the activities of Brook Farm with the Christian Hopedale Community and the Northampton Association of Education and Industry (Ross Farm) through quarterly meetings.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pp. 231-232. Three such conclaves were held before the idea was abandoned in October 1844 due to the divergent interests of the three communal experiments.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pg. 232. The Boston convention also led to the formation in January 1844 of a formal regional organization, the New England Fourier Society, in which Brisbane and William Henry Channing played a leading role. Efforts in Western New York proved somewhat fruitful, with a March 1844 meeting in Rochester resulting in the formation of a group called the American Industrial Union (AIU), attended by representatives of seven phalanxes.Guarneri, The Utopian Alternative, pg. 231. The group opened an office in Rochester in May and attempted to aid its member Associations through cooperative purchasing of supplies and coordinating trade of the products of each. The AIU soon was forced to terminate due to the rapid collapse of its member phalanxes, however, although the idea behind the organization made a lasting impression on prominent Fourierist leaders. These regional meetings were followed by a first attempt at a truly national conclave, with New York Fourierist leaders issuing a call for a \\"General Convention of the Friends of Association in the United States,\\" held in New York City from April 4‚Äì6, 1844. =Establishment= =Publications= =Decline and legacy= See also * List of Fourierist Associations in the United States * The Phalanx/The Harbinger * Albert Brisbane Footnotes Further reading * Arthur Bestor, American Phalanxes: A Study of Fourierist Socialism in the United States.

It was first discovered in Italy in 1974 by Cheli and Mortellaro. This disease is caused by a mixture of different bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria, including spirochetes of the genus Treponema, are found in the lesions associated with the infection. Digital dermatitis is different from foot rot in cattle and both conditions may occur concurrently. Digital dermatitis primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, but the quality of the milk is unaffected. Evidence show that risk factors favouring digital dermatitis outbreaks include: poor hygiene and high humidity; introduction of infected animals; no hoof care for heifers and dry cows; high levels of chronically infected animals; insufficient or inadequate hoof trimming; soft hooves and unbalanced nutrition. Presentation Digital dermatitis appears as lesions which initially looks like a raw, red, oval ulcer on the back of the heel. These lesions develop raised, hair-like projections or wart-like lesions, and some may extend up between the claws or appear on the front of the foot.http://www.producer.com/2014/08/digital-dermatitis-emerges-in-beef- cattle/ Cause Digital dermatitis is a polymicrobial disease involving treponemes and other anaerobes. Treponemes are the bacterium most commonly found in lesions. Their abundance increases as the lesion progresses. They account for 94% of bacterial sequences detected in chronic lesions. Diagnosis A scoring systemhttp://www.hoofhealth.ca/Dopfer.pdf was developed to classify the different stages of digital dermatitis, the M-stages system, where \\"M\\" stands for Mortellaro. The different stages are described as: M0, healthy skin; M1, early stage, skin defect < 2 cm diameter; M2, acute active ulcerative lesion; M3, healing stage, lesion covered with scab-like material; M4, chronic stage, that may be dyskeratotic (mostly thickened epithelium) or proliferative or both. Diagnosis is principally based on history and clinical signs. It is very rare that attempts are made to isolate the bacteria.Interdigital Dermatitis - Cattle reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 11 October 2011. Treatment  Treatment of lesions of digital dermatitis is done by topical application of agents to the affected skin. The skin should be cleaned and kept dry prior treatment. Topical oxytetracycline (OTC) is often referred as the most reliable treatment as cows treated with OTC have a good recovery rate. Bandaging the lesion is often undertaken but there is no evidence of any benefit and bandaging can provide the anaerobic environment which supports the spirochaetes. Systemic antibiotics are not needed. Control and prevention of digital dermatitis relies on prompt detection, isolation and treatment of affected cattle. Group hoof disinfection can be achieved via the passage of the cows through footbaths of antimicrobial solutions. Slurry build-up should be avoided since organic matter can impair the antimicrobial efficacy of the footbath solutions. Regular footbaths should be organised, using formalin, copper sulphate or a thymol-based disinfectant. While regular footbathing can help prevent hoof infections, occasional flare-up of active M2 lesions can happen. Copper sulfate footbaths are one of the most common forms of protection and treatment for digital dermatitis thanks to its antimicrobial trait and its ability to harden hooves to prevent exposure to bacteria. Copper is more effective as a prevention method rather than a treatment for digital dermatitis.Bjurstrom, A. (2016). Walking Strong A Fact Sheet on Dairy Hoof Health.

It was released for iOS in November 2015, Android in January 2016 and Microsoft Windows in November 2018.  Gameplay  The Room Three, as its predecessors, is an escape the room game, where by solving puzzle boxes and other similar puzzles, the player reveals new secrets and puzzles towards reaching the game's conclusion. The game is presented in a first-person, three-dimensional view, allowing the player to look around rooms from a spot, or rotate their view around a puzzle box or similar object. Elements of objects can be interacted with, such as pushing buttons, inserting and turning keys, or sliding sections around. Items can be collected and examined from the player's inventory, which many include manipulation of that object to reveal secret chambers or the like. As with previous games, The Room Three also has some puzzles made out of the classical element Null, which can bend reality. The player-character has a special eyepiece that he can wear to see through the Null, revealing hidden clues or puzzle parts. The Room Three introduces an additional lens for this eyepiece that allows the player-character to manipulate objects within small spaces like keyholes. The Room Three is structured around a central hub area and with four main areas that are accessed through this. There are optional puzzles scattered in the central hub that can be solved as to reach one of the game's alternate endings.  Plot  Continuing after the events of The Room Two, the player-character has escaped the home of \\"A.S.\\" before it was consumed by the entity from the Null. A journal written by the protagonist indicates that he is haunted by the events of The Room Two, and has tried to find answers via the Royal Institute. The Journal also indicates that he has found some clue that directs him to a strange island. He leaves on the train to go to the island. A strange box appears in his passenger compartment as the train passes through a tunnel, inside which is revealed a pyramid with strange etchings. When the train passes through the next tunnel, the player-character is mysteriously transported to Grey Holm, an island estate some ways off the English coastline in the English Channel. A series of notes inform the character that he was brought here by \\"The Craftsman\\", who also claims the credit of creating puzzles that were in the previous games, and is impressed with the character's ability to resist the Null. He wants to release the Null with help of the player character, and instructs him to collect four additional Null Shards, the same as the pyramid he collected on the train, which will help him gain the Craftsman's Key and open an exit from Grey Holm. The game has four different endings. Should the player only end up collecting the Craftsman's Key, he directs his character towards the Grey Holm tower, opening an exit back to the train with the key. However, once aboard the train, he finds a new note from The Craftsman that reveals that it was a ruse, and that his soul will be trapped forever. The camera pulls back to reveal the train to be running on rails within an infinite maze within a globe in Grey Holm (The \\"Imprisoned\\" ending). If the player solves additional puzzles in Grey Holm, a mechanical clairvoyant called Mystical Maggie aids the player by revealing that The Craftsman intends to use the player's soul as a sacrifice to the Null element; additional notes reveal Maggie had been human once and had also been lured by the Craftsman to Grey Holm. Interacting with Maggie provides additional clues to more devices like the Craftsman's Key. Depending on how the player uses these devices alongside the Craftsman's Key at the tower puzzle, the player-character can either escape Grey Holm and watch it destroyed by the Null entity (\\"Escape\\"), escape Grey Holm and watch the Null entity be released to the world (\\"Release\\"), or get teleported to the giant temples on the planet he remotely explored earlier in the game (\\"Lost\\").  Reception  The Room Three gained critical acclaim, with Metacritic giving a Metascore of 90 out of 100 based on 14 critics, and a reviewer from Hardcore Gamer giving a score of 4 out of 5. The game received a score of 9.0/10 by IGN, 5/5 by TouchArcade,<ref name=\\"TouchArcade /> and 8/10 by Game Informer. It was entitled with the Pocket Gamer Gold Award. Later it won iOS Game of the Year in Pocket Gamer Awards 2016. The game was enlisted among 60 Best Educational Apps by Tutora. It emerged as finalist under Best 3D Visuals and Best Mobile Game categories of Unity Awards 2016. The game was nominated for a BAFTA award.  Sequel  Fireproof Games released a sequel titled The Room: Old Sins. It was released on iOS on 15 January 2018 and on Android on 19 April 2018.

Career  Francis Norman was the younger brother of Sir Henry Wylie Norman, and was born on 25 April 1830 in London. He entered Addiscombe, and obtained his commission in the Bengal Army on 8 December 1848. After his regiment participated in the Mutiny of 1857, he was attached to the 14th (Ferozepore Sikh) Regiment, and he remained at Ferozepore during subsequent operations. He received the Indian Mutiny Medal for his service during the rebellion. In 1863, Norman took part in the Ambela Campaign, and was present at the storming of the Conical Hill and at the destruction of Laloo. He was mentioned in despatches, and added the India General Service Medal with clasp to the Mutiny Medal. In the three following years he was engaged during the Bhutan Campaign in the capture of Dewangiri and of the stockades in the Gurugaon Pass, serving as assistant quartermaster-general and receiving the \\"Bhootan\\" clasp and the brevet rank of major. In 1868, he took part in the Hazara Campaign as second-in-command of the 24th (Punjab) Regiment, again receiving the clasp. After an interval of ten years, the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878‚Äì80) brought him fresh opportunities of distinction. He commanded the 24th Regiment in the Bazar Valley and the defence of Jagdallak, marching with General Roberts's force from Kabul to Kandahar and taking part in the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. Mentioned in several despatches, he received the Afghanistan Medal with clasp \\"Kandahar\\", the bronze star, a Companionship of the Order of the Bath, and brevet colonelcy. During the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885, he commanded the Bengal Army brigade of the Upper Burma field force, assisting in the occupation of Mandalay and Bhamo. He was thanked by the government of British India and promoted to be Knight Commander of the Bath. He attained the rank of major-general on 1 September 1889. He was later promoted on the retired list.  Personal life  Francis Norman left India in 1891. He died on 25 June 1901 at Dulwich, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. He was twice married: in 1852 to Eliza Ellen, daughter of lieutenant Nisbett, Bengal Army, who died at Rawal Pindi in 1870; and in March 1892 to Caroline Matilda, daughter of the Rev. W. W. Cazalet and widow of Major E. F. J. Rennick, Bengal Staff Corps, who survived him. He left three sons and three daughters, one of the latter, Edith, being the wife of Sir Louis W.

It currently states its aim as 'to encourage interest in gaff rig, lug and spritsail rigs'. It was originally created in the early 1960s when some recreational sailors became concerned that traditional sailing boats were disappearing from British shores. It was hoped that holding races specifically for traditional boats would encourage people to own and maintain the boats. The activities have expanded over the years and now include a range of sailing and social events including winter lectures, cruising in company and events for small boats. The rules of the association require every area to hold at least one event every year which should include a race for gaff rigged boats. Most areas hold additional events including: * The Yarmouth Gaffers Regatta in the Solent (was held biennially, but in September 2018 it was announced that the event would no longer be held) * The August Classics Cruise in Suffolk and Essex * The Dublin Bay OGA Regatta * The Campbelltown Classics * Portaferry Sails and Sounds * Holyhead Traditional Boat Festival The OGA has a Youth Fund which provides small grants to OGA Areas to help fund events which get young people out sailing on traditionally rigged boats. Grants can also be made, on the recommendation of OGA Areas, for non-OGA projects fitting the criteria of the fund. The OGA has members all over the world. It has close links with affiliated associations in France, the Netherlands (which has members in Belgium), Canada and Australia.  History  The first ever ‚ÄòOld Gaffers‚Äô race was held on the Solent in 1959, with just 13 boats. A similar race was held on the east coast of England in 1963. The growing success of these early races, open to gaff rig boats, led to the formation of the OGA as a national association at the Little Ship Club, Maldon, Essex in 1963. In the early days, activities were focussed on rescuing or preserving old gaff rigged boats. Over the years areas have come and gone but Sailing Gaffers provides some indication of when the current areas started. * 1963 Solent, East Coast * 1973 South West, Scotland * 1974 North East * 1978 Bristol Channel * 1989 Northern Ireland, North West * 1991 Dublin Bay * 1997 North Wales * 2004 Trailer Section In 2013 the association celebrated its 50th anniversary with the publication of a book of stories from the history of the Association. 21 member boats from the UK and the Netherlands took part in a UK circumnavigation (Round Britain Challenge) and hosted a number of area based events culminating in a Golden Jubilee Festival at Cowes attended by more than 180 gaff-rigged boats.

History According to the Patria of Constantinople, the construction of this cistern, which lay in the twelfth region of Constantinople, occurred under Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491-518). The name came from the important church dedicated to Saint Mocius, which was located near the southwest corner of the reservoir.Mamboury (1953), p. 326 The cistern, which lay just outside the Wall of Constantine, which formed the city's original landward boundary, was built to supply water to the new quarters erected between the former and the 5th-century Theodosian Walls.Janin (1964, p. 33 Writing after the Ottoman conquest of 1453, the 16th-century French traveler Pierre Gilles observed that around 1540 the reservoir was empty.

It was ideologically aligned with the Situationist International, an avant-garde revolutionary movement. The Situationists, whose intellectual foundations were derived primarily from libertarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century (particularly Dada and Surrealism), initially put its emphasis on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. Gradually the focus moved more towards revolutionary and political theory. Much like the main organ of that particular ideological current, the Situationist International, the Golden Fleet had its heyday around the protests of 1968, gradually disappearing by the first years of the 1970s. Extremely little is known about the Golden Fleet, yet still it became notorious, this to such an extent that it has been labelled \\"legendary\\". Nothing is known about its establishment, composition, and disestablishment. The name was most likely taken from an art exhibit in Denmark by the Situationist Jeppesen Victor Martin, which consisted of geopolitical paintings featuring coastlines, strategic arrows and toy battleships sprayed over with metallic paint. The group was centered in the capital Stockholm, although some members appear to have been from Gothenburg. It is primarily notable through the fact that its members were those that introduced situationist writings to Sweden by its brief but hectic work with publishing political texts. Among them were Instruktion i vapendragning in 1970 (a translation of \\"Instructions for an Insurrection\\", originally published 1961), as well as longer translations of texts by Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem among others. The group also produced a number of works on its own, prominent among them the poster \\"Hang the Stalinists High\\" (, on the subject of the contemporary left-wing) and the brochure \\"King Gustaf's Sardines\\" () which discussed the \\"meaningful meaninglessness of the Swedish students\\". Another Situationist group existed in Sweden, the Second Situationist International of J√∏rgen Nash, but there appears to have been no connection between the Golden Fleet and the Nashists.

The PAM is a component of the invading virus or plasmid, but is not found in the bacterial host genome and hence is not a component of the bacterial CRISPR locus. Cas9 will not successfully bind to or cleave the target DNA sequence if it is not followed by the PAM sequence. PAM is an essential targeting component which distinguishes bacterial self from non-self DNA, thereby preventing the CRISPR locus from being targeted and destroyed by the CRISPR-associated nuclease. Spacers/protospacers In a bacterial genome, CRISPR loci contain \\"spacers\\" (viral DNA inserted into a CRISPR locus) that in type II adaptive immune systems were created from invading viral or plasmid DNA (called \\"protospacers\\"). Upon subsequent invasion, a CRISPR-associated nuclease such as Cas9 attaches to a tracrRNA‚ÄìcrRNA complex, which guides Cas9 to the invading protospacer sequence. But Cas9 will not cleave the protospacer sequence unless there is an adjacent PAM sequence. The spacer in the bacterial CRISPR loci will not contain a PAM sequence, and thus will not be cut by the nuclease, but the protospacer in the invading virus or plasmid will contain the PAM sequence, and thus will be cleaved by the Cas9 nuclease. In genome editing applications, a short oligonucleotide known as a guide RNA (gRNA) is synthesized to perform the function of the tracrRNA‚ÄìcrRNA complex in recognizing gene sequences having a PAM sequence at the 3'-end, thereby \\"guiding\\" the nuclease to a specific sequence which the nuclease is capable of cutting. PAM sequences The canonical PAM is the sequence 5'-NGG-3', where \\"N\\" is any nucleobase followed by two guanine (\\"G\\") nucleobases. Guide RNAs can transport Cas9 to any locus in the genome for gene editing, but no editing can occur at any site other than one at which Cas9 recognizes PAM. The canonical PAM is associated with the Cas9 nuclease of Streptococcus pyogenes (designated SpCas9), whereas different PAMs are associated with the Cas9 proteins of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, Treponema denticola, and Streptococcus thermophilus. 5'-NGA-3' can be a highly efficient non-canonical PAM for human cells, but efficiency varies with genome location. Attempts have been made to engineer Cas9s to recognize different PAMs in order to improve the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to edit genes at any desired genome location. The Cas9 of Francisella novicida recognizes the canonical PAM sequence 5'-NGG-3', but has been engineered to recognize 5'-YG-3' (where \\"Y\\" is a pyrimidine), thus adding to the range of possible Cas9 targets. The Cpf1 nuclease of Francisella novicida recognizes the PAM 5'-TTTN-3' or 5'-YTN-3'. Aside from CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1, there are doubtless many yet undiscovered nucleases and PAMs. CRISPR/Cas13a (formerly C2c2) from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii is an RNA-guided CRISPR system that targets sequences in RNA rather than DNA. PAM is not relevant for an RNA-targeting CRISPR, although a guanine flanking the target negatively affects efficacy, and has been designated a \\"protospacer flanking site\\" (PFS). GUIDE-Seq A technology called GUIDE-Seq has been devised to assay off- target cleavages produced by such gene editing. The PAM requirement can be exploited to specifically target single-nucleotide heterozygous mutations while exerting no aberrant effects on wild-type alleles.

The film stars Sam Riley as a lone traveler who ends up in a small town in the Alps, finding corruption and tyranny running rampant. It was selected as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Plot The film opens with a scene of a scared young man and woman hiding in the basement of a wooden building. Footsteps are heard from above, and then several men find them, severely assaulting the man and then dragging them both away as the woman screams. Some time later, a young stranger rides into a remote town somewhere in the Austrian Alps. Having introduced himself as a photographer, Mr Greider, he becomes the lodger of a widow whose husband and son suffered an untimely death. Soon, the newcomer learns that the entire town is firmly under the dominion of an aged rich man named Old Brenner and his six power-drunk sons. One day, the widow sends her daughter to town to run some errands. Greider is invited, and decides to accompany young Luzi. As Luzi does her shopping, Greider asks for coffee and horseshoe nails. The brothers discover him at her side within the store, and command him to drink their schnapps. When he politely refuses by stating that he \\"doesn't drink,\\" one of the brothers beats him into compliance. Later, one of the Brenner brothers dies in what looks like a freak logging accident. Soon this same fate befalls another of the brothers; he falls off a cliff having been blinded by a branch with nails on it. Old Brenner finds nails in his dead son's eyes. Since Greider is suspected to have had his hand in these accidents, he hides. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Brenners walk in the footsteps of their father. At every local wedding they claim the (fictional) medieval prerogative of Primae noctis; only Greider's parents (the young couple from the opening scene) had refused to comply. For that defiance, the Brenners crucified Greider's father, but his mother managed to escape and find refuge in America. The local priest still supports what the Brenners do. Greider confronts the priest in private, revealing that he's come to crack down on the Brenners. He admits that he did kill the two Brenner sons. After telling the priest that he's next to die, Greider shoots him. Greider rescues Luzi from the grasp of the Brenners after she marries Lukas and is abducted. Greider challenges them to a duel on the next day. Rather than waiting for the appointed duel, the brothers try to ambush Greider at the remote mountain cabin where he is holed up. At dawn they come after him, attacking all together. A shootout ensues. Greider is outnumbered four-to-one, but he has the advantage of a Winchester lever-action repeating rifle, while the Brenners all wield two shot side-by-side and breechloading rifles, and are unfamiliar with a repeating rifle. Skillfully leveraging this edge, Greider kills or leaves for dead the remaining four brothers. He then seeks to deliver the message of their deaths to their father, but discovers that some citizens of the town remain loyal to Brenner senior. As Greider approaches Brenner's home he is attacked by the blacksmith, a hulking giant brandishing a large iron log hook. Lukas manages to save Greider by shooting the blacksmith, but not before the hook finds its way through Grieder's shoulder. After the fight, Greider storms Old Brenner's house and finds him in his bed. Greider gives Old Brenner a picture of his mother, explaining the reason for killing Old Brenner's sons and now him. Old Brenner reveals to Greider that he is Greider's father (a product of his mother's rape by Brenner on her wedding night) and so therefore he has murdered his own half-brothers. Brenner asks him \\"to make it quick\\" and Greider obliges by shooting him in the heart. Greider recovers for three weeks from his wounds. Meanwhile, the various families that live on the valley ask to punish Greider as many have relatives to Old Brenner due to his ways. Greider leaves the valley, never to return.

The facility was opened in 1930, and is now the oldest operational federal penitentiary in Ontario. The main prison is medium security, with a minimum security facility (formerly Frontenac Institution) residing on the same property. A 96-bed maximum security unit is also operational. History Collins Bay Institution was opened in 1930 under the name \\"Preferred Class Penitentiary (Ontario)\\" to accommodate the growing number of inmates in the Ontario region. Inmates from Kingston Penitentiary, only 2 km away, assisted in the construction of the new prison. The facility was built to further the government strategy of creating a graduated tier of penalties, that placed offenders in levels of security corresponding to the crime. The main building (A-1) was built in the Canadian Chateau style, and has steeply pitched red metal roofing. Dormers are symmetrically placed across the front and rear, with pointed towers at the corners. The center tower is much taller than the others, with a steeple on top. Local Kingston Ontario residents have opted to informally call this structure \\"Disneyland North\\", due to its castle-like resemblance. Collins Bay Institution has a long history of violence, and unrest. \\"The Bay\\" or \\"CBI\\" has the moniker of \\"Gladiator School\\", in reference to frequent deadly clashes between inmates. Living units The first living unit (cell block B-1 built in 1932) was a rectangular, two-story structure. It consists of limestone, and has a mansard roof. It has half-circle windows on the outer walls, and cell enclosures confined to the centre of the building. It was the first building erected within the walls of the prison, and signified a permanency to local residents. A further 3 similar cell blocks were constructed over the next 20 years (B-2, B-3 and B-4). The blocks were referenced as \\"1 Block, 2 Block, 3 Block & 4 Block\\" by staff and inmates. As of 2014, there are 32 buildings within Collins Bay Institution. The original 4 cell blocks were demolished to make way for the new units, which are of a hub- and-spoke design. Buildings 6-9 were added in 2008, and Building 11 in 2014. Building 11 is a 3500 sq. m. maximum security unit that can accommodate the overflow of inmates after the Kingston Penitentiary closed in 2013.

Production  The African civet is one of the species that secretes civet fluid. A number of viverrid species secrete civet oil in their perineal glands, including the African civet (Civettictis civetta), large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha) and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica). Most civet is produced in African farms, where African civets are kept in cages for this purpose. African civets typically produce three to four grams of civet per week. In 2000, civet sold for about five hundred dollars per kilogram. Civet is a soft, almost liquid material. It is pale yellow when fresh, darkening in the light and becoming salve-like in consistency. Its odor is strong, even putrid as a pure substance, but once diluted it is pleasantly and sweetly aromatic. It is prepared for use in perfumery by solvent extraction to yield either a tincture (10 or 20 percent), an absolute, or a resinoid.  Composition  The chemical in civet oil that gives it most of its distinctive odor is civetone, at a concentration of between 2.5 and 3.4 percent. The oil also includes various other ketones such as cyclopentadecanone, cyclohexadecanone, cycloheptadecanone, and 6-cis-cycloheptadecenone. The animal scent is reinforced by the presence of smaller amounts of indole and skatole, which in African civet are present at a concentration of about 1 percent.  Uses  Civet has a distinctly different odor from musk and was formerly a versatile ingredient of fine fragrances. It is being displaced by 5-cyclohexadecen-1-one (Ambretone) which is more easily synthesized. Civet absolute [68916-26-7] is used as a flavor and in perfumery.  Safety  The USA does not allow civets to be imported, as the species can transmit the SARS virus. The USA does however permit the importation of civet oil, as long as it has been treated to ensure it is noninfectious.  Name  The name derives from the Arabic ÿ≤ÿ®ÿßÿØ zabƒÅd or ÿ≥ŸÜŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≤ÿ®ÿßÿØ sinnawr al-zabƒÅd, civet cat (Viverra civetta), by way of Old Italian zibetto and Middle French civette.  History  The 10th century Arab historian al-Masudi mentioned civet (zabƒÅda) as a spice in his book Mur≈´ _dj_ al- _dh_ ahab (Meadows of Gold). Civet was among the many trade items that caravans, controlled by the Ghana empire, carried from the Niger valley to North Africa.

Buenos Aires, June 10, 1957) is an Argentinian agronomist and politician who has held a wide range of positions at the top of national and municipal government of Argentina. Following the resignation of Ra√∫l Jaime in 2009, Schiavi was appointed Argentina's Ministry of Transportation. He left the position after the Once Tragedy of 2012, a product of infrastructure problems that were widely believed to be the result of corruption and negligence in his ministry. He was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for his responsibility in the accident. In an account of Schiavi's history of political loyalties, the newspaper La Naci√≥n described him as having been, in turn, a ‚ÄúGrossista‚Äù (a disciple of Carlos Grosso) a ‚ÄúMacrista‚Äù (Mauricio Macri), a ‚ÄúTelermanista‚Äù (Jorge Telerman), a ‚ÄúDevidista‚Äù (Julio De Vido), and finally a ‚ÄúCristinista‚Äù (Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner). Early life and education At age 15, he was active in the Montoneros, a left-wing urban guerrilla group. He went on to become a member of the militant Peronist Youth and belonged to a group of ‚Äúangry militant Peronists‚Äù who made headlines when they tried to force their way into the Casa Rosada on 19 December 1982. Schiavi received a degree in agricultural engineering at the University of Buenos Aires in 1985. Between 1983 and 1985 he did laboratory and field experiments involving wheat and corn for the National Institute of Agricultural Economics. Early career In 1985 he became managing partner of a long-distance carrier and directed a study of agricultural advisers. He won his first political office in 1987 when he served as a consultant to the Peronist bloc on the City Council of Buenos Aires. While Carlos Grosso was Mayor of the City of Buenos Aires, he appointed Schiavi as Ministry of Maintenance Services for the municipality, which meant that he was ‚Äúin charge of the lucrative agreements for the collection of waste.‚Äù The city's main waste-disposal contractor was Manliba, a firm that was a part of Grupo Macri- SOCMA. During this period Schiavi entered the orbit of the president of SOCMA, Mauricio Macri, for whom he would later work, and also developed a close relationship with SOCMA executive Daniel Cha√≠n, who later became the city's Secretary of Urban Development. After Carlos Grosso, described by La Naci√≥n as ‚Äúan icon of Peronist renovation,‚Äù left his job ‚Äúamid a flood of corruption allegations,‚Äù Schiavi went into business with Chain, with whom he ran an architectural firm during most of the 1990s. Together they renovated some 30 train stations. Later, when Macri went into municipal politics and ran for Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2003, Chain joined his campaign team and recommended that Macri hire Schiavi, who became Macri's campaign manager. Macri lost a runoff election for Mayor of Buenos Aires to Anibal Ibarra, but Schiavi stayed in his employ until 2005. While working as director of the city's Public Services Regulatory Authority, Schiavi met Ricardo Jaime and Julio De Vido, the latter of whom, according to La Naci√≥n, would become ‚Äúhis protector in the K world‚Äù (that is, the circle of politicians and business people surrounding the Kirchner regime). After this, Schiavi rejoined the Peronists in Buenos Aires. After Ibarra was removed from office, he was replaced by his deputy, Jorge Telerman, who in 2006 appointed Schiavi as Secretary of Planning and Public Works. Schiavi developed a relationship with Julio De Vido, the national Secretary of Federal Planning. When Macri became Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, De Vido summoned Schiavi to head Administration (ADIF), a state company that was created to promote investments. Ministry of Transport On 1 July 2009, Raul Jaime resigned as Secretary of Transportation in the midst of a corruption scandal. He was replaced by Schiavi. The position placed Schiavi in control of a budget of over one billion pesos per month. It was reported in February 2010 that Schiavi and Jaime were both being investigated, and had been subpoenaed, for illegally accepting free flights on airlines while they were working in the government. Schiavi had supposedly traveled without charge to Brazil with Jaime in September 2006, when Schiavi was Secretary of Planning and Public Works for Buenos Aires. Schiavi was still being investigated in 2012. =Once railway accident, resignation, and aftermath= On 22 February 2012, a train on the Sarmiento line in Buenos Aires crashed in the Once railway station, killing 51 people and injuring more than 700. It was the second-worst train disaster in Argentinian history. Schiavi was widely criticized by the public, as well as by both his own party and the opposition party, for saying on the day of the accident that the death toll would have been far lower if it had taken place a day earlier, during Carnaval, or on another public holiday. The infrastructure deficiencies that made the disaster possible were blamed in large part on the corruption in the Ministry of Transportation. On 28 February, a news report described Schiavi as having been ‚Äúcaught in the eye of the storm since the train crash.‚Äù An account of a meeting between Schiavi and members of the press in the wake of the tragedy described the encounter as ‚Äújust the latest example of a new norm in Argentina‚Äôs press life in which personalities call in the press to speak their truth and take no grilling.‚Äù On 7 March, Schiavi handed in his resignation, stating in his letter that he was stepping down for medical reasons. ‚ÄúI am to be treated for a transluminal coronary angioplasty and another two simple angioplasties, which both require a minimum of sixty days of recovery time following medical advice,‚Äù he wrote. It was reported, however, that Schiavi had been forced out, and that his boss, de Vido, had phoned him and told him that the President had said he ‚Äúhad to go.‚Äù As part of the judicial investigation, Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio prohibited Schiavi from leaving the country. In October, Schiavi was among those indicted on various charges in connection with the accident. It was widely noted that the Once accident was not an isolated incident. In the first half of 2012, ‚Äúthere were more than 1,200 accidents and 190 deaths on Argentina‚Äôs main train lines,‚Äù reported the Christian Science Monitor in 2013, which added that the families of victims blamed their deaths on the Fernandez de Kirchner government, saying it had failed to act to improve a severely deteriorated system featuring ‚Äúdecrepit‚Äù tracks. ‚ÄúOnce is the best example of Kirchnerism‚Äôs failure to act,‚Äù Leandro Bullor, an analyst at the University of Buenos Aires, told the Monitor. Two years after the Once disaster, in March 2014, Schiavi, Jaime, and other officials went on trial for having played roles in the corruption, incompetence, and negligence that were said to have led to the incident. Judge Bonadio, who had conducted the investigation into the causes of the tragedy, attributed it to ‚Äúsinister officials and trade unionists.‚Äù Testifying in April, Schiavi denied that he was not guilty of negligence and dissociated himself from the tragedy. ‚ÄúI will not take criminal responsibility for something I did not commit and did not cause,‚Äù he said. However, he admitted that the company that been operating the Sarmiento line at the time of the disaster, Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA), ‚Äúwas a bad concessionary.‚Äù Personal life His nickname is ‚ÄúJuampi‚Äù and La Naci√≥n has said that his main political asset seems to be his ‚Äúversatility‚Äù or ‚Äúgelatin-like quality.‚Äù References Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine agronomists Category:Argentine politicians Category:Politicians from Buenos Aires ","title":"Juan Pablo Schiavi"},{"id":"43733199","text":"The Wheeling Stogies was a minor league baseball team based in Wheeling, West Virginia, that played under several different names at various times between 1877 and 1934. They played mostly in the Central League and the Middle Atlantic League, as well as in several various other area-based leagues. History The Stogies can be traced back to 1877 and the city's first professional team known as Wheeling Standard, which featured Jack Glasscock and Chappy Lane. Then in 1887 the city once again fielded a new team known simply in the record books as Wheeling. However, the following season, Wheeling came to be called the \\"Nail City\\" for its nail industry, creating the Wheeling Nailers, a team name which even today is used for the city's professional ice hockey team. The team was also known as the Wheeling National Citys, and in 1895 as the Wheeling Mountaineers, which consisted of future major leaguers: Tom O'Brien and Dewey McDougal. The town also had a thriving tobacco industry with Marsh Wheeling's Stogies as a leading enterprise, and later the club's name changed to the Wheeling Stogies in 1899. In 1900 Ed Poole went 20‚Äì15 for the Wheeling Stogies. He also played in the infield and outfield when he didn't pitch and batted .257. Poole was then acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates and made his major league debut in October of that year. He was a member of the Pirates National League pennant winning team in 1901.\\"Ed Poole Statistics and History\\". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved 2010-12-04. Under manager Bill Phillips, the club won Central League titles in 1909 and 1910. The Stogies' 1909 season featured Hall of Fame inductee, Bill McKechnie. The 1909 season also featured several memorable exhibition games. The first was against a barnstorming team led by baseball great Cap Anson his semi- professional team, which he called \\"Anson's Colts\\". The Colts defeated the Stogies 10-4 with Anson going 1-5 and scoring a run for the Colts, while Bill McKechnie went 1-4 with a run for Wheeling. The Stogies also faced the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Athletics that season, losing 7-2 and 3-0 respectively. However, on April 8, 1909, the Stogies defeated the Athletics 5-4 in front of just 250 fans at Wheeling. The Pittsburgh Pirates purchased McKechnie from Wheeling at the end of the season. However, to close out the 1909 season, the Pirates, who had just won the 1909 World Series, and the Central League champions played against each other in an exhibition game in Wheeling. The Stogies defeated the Pirates 9-1; however, the Pittsburgh club played many back-up players in the game. Following their 1912 season, the Central League revoked the Wheeling franchise, after the club experienced serious financial difficulty. During the 1912 season the Central League went to a 12-team league, and increased monthly salaries from $1,500 to $2,100. This caused only 4 of the league's teams to profit. As a result, Wheeling and the 5 easternmost teams were cut from the league. Wheeling and the other five teams then formed the third Interstate League. However, flooding and financial hardship forced two of the league's clubs in Ohio to fold, and the league ended operations on July 21, 1913. The following season, Wheeling did not field a team. However, on February 22, 1915, the team was reorganized and was once again a member of the Central League. The new team featured Goat Anderson and future 1919 World Series winner and Philadelphia Eagles football coach, Greasy Neale. Despite having Neale in the line-up the 1915 season, the team finished near the bottom of the standings. The following season Neale was sold to the Cincinnati Reds of the National League. The team finished in fourth place during the 1916 season. However, the team folded again in 1917 due to struggles associated with World War I. The Stogies once again took to the field in 1925, as a member of the Middle Atlantic League. During this time, the team consisted of brothers Dan and Art Rooney. Art, an outfielder, led the team in games played, runs scored, hits and stolen bases. However, he would be more famous for his efforts in football as the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League in 1933. He would become a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964. Meanwhile, Dan played at catcher and would later change his name to Silas and become a Franciscan priest. Legacy In June 2004, the Washington Wild Things of the independent Frontier League wore Stogies jerseys to honor the team against the Chillicothe Paints.

In 1977, Kraus began her tenure at The New York Times. She was the first art director of the Living section. She began at the op-ed section in 1979. At Op-Ed, Kraus commissioned many illustrations from well-known artists, including Ralph Steadman, Roland Topor, Maurice Sendak. Kraus spent 30 years at The New York Times, 13 of them at op-ed. = Freelance writing = In addition to her work as an art director, Kraus has been published as a freelance writer. In 1978, she published Museum Mammoth Is a Metamporph on the cover of the New York Times Metropolitan section. The article, \\",\\" featured Gerry Lynas, a New York sculptor, building two large-scale ice sculptures‚Äîone of a Wooly Mammoth and one of a Stegosaurus‚Äîin front of the American Museum of Natural History. In 1998, Kraus published several pieces about the death of Roland Topor, graphic artist, novelist, and Kraus' friend. The Endpaper of the New York Times Magazine published, \\",\\" a tribute to Topor following his death. Her short piece, \\"Many Muses,\\" was published in The New Yorker commissioned by Tina Brown. In 2001, she wrote an article entitled \\"Charmed by Morocco in a Wink,\\" that appeared in the travel section of the New York Times. In 2003, she subbed for William Safire's New York Times column, \\"On Language.\\" The piece, headlined, \\"Fancifying,\\" is about Americans' desire to use highbrow language and how this often results in incorrect usage. In 2011, Kraus published two book reviews in USA Today. The first was a review of Laurence Bergreen's book Columbus: the Four Voyages. The second, a review of Tolstoy: A Russian Life by Rosamund Bartlett, was published as one of four reviews of biographies of major novelists. Kraus' book All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some that Wasn't): Inside the New York Times Op-Ed Page was published by Columbia University Press in 2009. It tells the history of Op-Ed, the revolutionary phenomenon that began at The New York Times in 1970. Though it focuses on the art of Op-Ed, it remains the only book about Op-Ed. In addition to being a large format coffee-table book, it is used as a text book for journalism and illustration courses at the university level. The book has received many reviewers' acclaim including The Washington Post, Bill Maher, San Francisco Chronicle, Ralph Steadman, Slate, History Wire, Publishers Weekly, Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, and NBC.com.  Current life Kraus lives in New York City where she works as a freelance writer and teaches as an adjunct professor at Fordham University. She is a blogger for The Huffington Post where she published a revised excerpt from her book entitled My Morning with Nixon. She is the ex-wife of Argetine artist, Horacio Cardo, who died on October 22, 2018 of complications caused by a stroke.

Special automotive engineering and human factors considerations exist for the application of forced induction with motorcycles, compared to other forms of motorized transportation. Forced induction in production motorcycles Prior to the late 2010s, forced induction was only used on a handful of production motorcycles, all from Japanese Big Four manufacturers in the early 1980s. *Honda 1982 CX 500 Turbo / 1983 650 Turbo *Yamaha 1982-1983 XJ 650 Seca Turbo *Suzuki 1983 XN 85 Turbo *Kawasaki 1983-1985 GPZ750 Turbo Honda CX650 Turbo had 674 CC, 100 BHP and Moto Guzzi-style V-twin engine. It is contestably the best forced induction production bikes of 1980s from Japanese manufacturers. 1983-model of Honda CX650 Turbos had solved lag problems, which earlier models like CX500 Turbo encountered. To rectify turbo lags, capacity and compression ratio was raised from 7.2:1 to 7.8:1. Additionally, in 1978 Kawasaki offered the Z1R-TC, a semi-production model built by Turbo Cycle Corporation and sold through Kawasaki dealers. This is generally considered to be the first Japanese turbocharged motorcycle. The Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki bikes were all listed on a State Farm insurance \\"blacklist\\" published by American Motorcyclist in 1989. =21st century= A scooter with a supercharger, the Peugeot JetForce Compressor, was available in late 2003. Kawasaki confirmed it would be re-entering the market with the supercharged Kawasaki Ninja H2, announced in October, 2014. This was followed by the H2 SX SE sports tourer, and for 2020 Kawasaki announced a new naked model, designated Z H2. =Engineering and usability challenges= Designers have been able to address packaging issues and fit turbochargers even in fully faired motorcycles. Turbo lag was noted as a problem with all four Japanese turbos of the 1980s by several critics. quotes an expert's dry summary of these bikes' \\"difficult power characteristics\\" Motorcycle engineering expert and journalist Kevin Cameron has said that turbo lag is a critical problem with turbocharger applications on motorcycles: \\"[U]nless you are a pure drag racer, most of your riding will be off-boost. The lower your compression ratio, the less snap your bike will have...don't expect your turbo bike to be much use in sportbike-type canyon racing.\\" Using a variable-geometry turbocharger can mitigate turbo lag, but has not yet been used in series production (the first mass market application was to late 1980s automobiles; see Variable-geometry turbocharger#History and examples of use). Writer Mick Walker has listed turbo lag along with other challenges like a higher center of gravity and heat transfer to rider due to turbocharger and associated exhaust plumbing. Bennett noted excessive weight and complexity in addition to weak bottom-end performance. The German magazine Motorrad said in 2014 that a turbocharger would probably never be practical on mass market motorcycles due to cost of high-tech materials able to withstand the high temperatures of a variable geometry turbocharger, plus weight and space considerations, though they left the door open for a good supercharged solution. =Emissions= Emissions considerations, driven in particular by carbon dioxide limits in the European emission standards, are leading motorcycle manufacturers in the 2010s to reconsider applications of forced induction. In racing In road racing, superchargers were not uncommon in the 1930s, and machines originally built for road racing also set many land speed records (see the list below for examples). Motorcycle racing in Europe went through a hiatus during the 1940s as World War II and its aftermath, and racing only restarted in 1946. That same year, forced induction was banned from road racing by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), effectively relegating it to specialized forms of racing and speed record runs, discussed further below. Rules from the FIM and other sanctioning bodies cover aspects of motorcycle design as diverse as motorcycle fairing coverage, gasoline direct injection, and the use of dual-clutch transmissions, and may influence street bike design by setting public expectations. =Drag racing= Specialized motorcycles used in drag racing, called dragbikes, are an application for forced induction, including nitrous oxide and multistage turbochargers. The first dragbike to run the quarter-mile in under 7 seconds was using a Roots-type supercharger. Motorcycle clubs At least one motorcycle club, Turbo Motorcycle International Owners Association, has been formed to support turbo motorcycle enthusiasts.

Elected to the first of his two terms in 1984, Givens was the first African American Republican member of the state House since the Reconstruction era.\\"New Lubbock legislator Givens optimistic about new session: Givens the first black Republican legislator in 103 years\\", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, January 7, 1985 Early life and education Givens graduated from the historically black Dunbar-Struggs High School in Lubbock; the institution, an entity of the Lubbock Independent School District, closed in 1993 and became a junior high school. He received a bachelor of arts degree in political science from the historically black Huston-Tillotson University in the state capital city of Austin. His father, R. J. Givens, Jr., also graduated from the then Huston-Tillotson College. His mother, the former Octavia Middleton, graduated from Peoples Business College in Austin. R. J. and Octavia Givens founded Givens Real Estate in Lubbock. R. J. also worked for 32 years for the U.S. Post Office in Lubbock and became the first black to serve on the editorial board of the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. In 1965, Mrs. Givens was named the first black cashier of what became Excel Energy in Lubbock. In 1970, she became the first black female affiliated with the Lubbock Association of Realtors; in 1974, she founded Givens Employment Agency in Lubbock. Career Givens attributed his interest in public affairs in part to one of his Huston-Tillotson professors, Harriet Murphy, who \\"insisted that all of her students go into the community to work in some part of government.\\" Givens set his interest in the Texas House, which he visited as a high-school junior as part of the 1969 Boys State convention. The House is within walking distance of Huston-Tillotson. Givens did substitute teaching and served a stint in the United States Army before he launched his brief political career in Lubbock. Political career Givens ran as a Republican, he said, because his overall political beliefs fell on that side of the aisle because of his business background.Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, February 17, 1985 Givens unseated the four-term Democratic Representative Froy Salinas of Lubbock in the 1984 general election. On that same ballot, Ronald W. Reagan was re-elected U.S. President, and Phil Gramm was first elected to the United States Senate from Texas to succeed fellow Republican John Tower. In both House terms, Givens served on the House Cultural and Historical Resources Committee; in the second term, he was also assigned to the Public Health Committee. Givens and State Senator John T. Montford of Lubbock worked to create a new county court at law judgeship for Lubbock County. The new court relieved case loads from the five state district courts within Lubbock County. At the end of his first legislative session, Texas Monthly magazine awarded Givens its annual \\"Bum Steer\\", derided him as \\"new furniture\\", and of \\"little consequence during his first term.\\" Representative Paul Ragsdale of Dallas, the chairman of the Texas House Black Caucus in 1985, termed Givens \\"a boll weevil looking for a home.\\" Givens said that his dozen black House colleagues, all Democrats, \\"didn't know how to take me ...I chose to vote on the issue and how it would best help my constituency. They saw my position as a threat because of that.\\" Givens did not seek a third term and was succeeded in 1989 by former state Representative Delwin Jones, a Democrat-turned-Republican. Givens left the House because of the low compensation of lawmakers. He once said that one really needed to be \\"rich or a lawyer\\" to serve in the legislature. After leaving the legislature, Givens taught school in Angelton in Brazoria County in the Houston metropolitan area and served a four-year compensated term on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. His wife, the former Margie Martin, whom he married in 1991, and he returned to Lubbock in 1995, where he remains in the real estate and tax-preparation business. Givens was not the first black Republican since Reconstruction to win office in Lubbock County. In 1982, Justice of the Peace McKinley Shephard became the first black to win office as a Republican in the county. Two other Republicans, Joan Ervin and T. J. Patterson, thereafter won seats on the nominally nonpartisan Lubbock City Council.

It was defined in September 2014, when a group of astronomers including R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii, H√©l√®ne Courtois of the University of Lyon, Yehuda Hoffman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Daniel Pomar√®de of CEA Universit√© Paris-Saclay published a new way of defining superclusters according to the relative velocities of galaxies. The new definition of the local supercluster subsumes the prior defined local supercluster, the Virgo Supercluster, as an appendage. Follow-up studies suggest that the Local Supercluster is not gravitationally bound; it will disperse rather than continue to maintain itself as an overdensity relative to surrounding areas. Although the Laniakea supercluster is an extremely large structure, even larger cosmic structures have been detected.  Name  The alternative name means 'immense heaven' in Hawaiian, . The name was suggested by Nawa'a Napoleon, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at Kapiolani Community College. The name honors Polynesian navigators, who used knowledge of the heavens to navigate the Pacific Ocean.  Characteristics  The Local Supercluster encompasses approximately 100,000 galaxies stretched out over . It has the approximate mass of 1017 solar masses, or a hundred thousand times that of our galaxy, which is almost the same as that of the Horologium Supercluster. It consists of four subparts, which were known previously as separate superclusters: * Virgo Supercluster, the part in which the Milky Way resides. * Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster ** the Great Attractor, Laniakea's central gravitational point near Norma ** Antlia Wall, known as Hydra Supercluster ** Centaurus Supercluster * Pavo-Indus Supercluster * Southern Supercluster, including Fornax Cluster (S373), Dorado and Eridanus clouds. The most massive galaxy clusters of the Local Supercluster are Virgo, Hydra, Centaurus, Abell 3565, Abell 3574, Abell 3521, Fornax, Eridanus and Norma. The entire supercluster consists of approximately 300 to 500 known galaxy clusters and groups. The real number may be much larger because some of these are traversing the Zone of Avoidance, an area of the sky that is partially obscured by gas and dust from the Milky Way galaxy, making them essentially undetectable. Superclusters are some of the universe's largest structures and have boundaries that are difficult to define, especially from the inside. The team used radio telescopes to map the motions of a large collection of local galaxies. Within a given supercluster, most galaxy motions will be directed inward, toward the center of mass. In the case of Laniakea, this gravitational focal point is called the Great Attractor, and influences the motions of the Local Group of galaxies, where the Milky Way galaxy resides, and all others throughout the supercluster. Unlike its constituent clusters, Laniakea is not gravitationally bound and is projected to be torn apart by dark energy. Although the confirmation of the existence of the Local Supercluster emerged in 2014, early studies in the 1980s already suggested that several of the Superclusters then known might be connected. For example, South African astronomer Tony Fairall stated in 1988 that redshifts suggested that the Virgo and Hydra-Centaurus Superclusters may be connected.  Location  The neighboring superclusters to the Local Supercluster are the Shapley Supercluster, Hercules Supercluster, Coma Supercluster and Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, they are all part of the composition of the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex. The edges of the superclusters and Laniakea were not clearly known at the time of Laniakea's definition. Since then, the study of the edges of the supercluster and of structures beyond them has substantially improved.

History CELCIS was established in 2011 with the intention being to provide a holistic approach, rather than serving a specialist part of the professionals who deal with looked after children. It was established to facilitate collaboration and therefore works with a range of organisations to improve outcomes relating to the lives of looked after children in Scotland. The centre was preceded by the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care (SIRCC), which was a centre of excellence that had been set up in 2000. In 2019 its name was revised to reflect its broader remit including supporting child protection work in Scotland. Types of work that CELCIS are involved with include supporting policy implementation, oversight of the looked after children strategic group and the provision of training, information resources and consultancy. Since August 2012 they have a specific responsibility for identifying the development needs of professionals working with looked after children. The Centre is core funded by the Scottish Government. They are hosted by the University of Strathclyde. The Independent Chair of the Centre is Professor Alexis Jay, Chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse - IICSA (England and Wales), Visiting Professor, University of Strathclyde. International Work In 2012 they were commissioned by the International Social Service to produce the ‚ÄúMoving Forward‚Äù report which aims to embed children‚Äôs rights in alternative care provision. In 2014 they were commissioned by SOS Children‚Äôs Villages to produce \\"Drumming Together for Change: A Child‚Äôs Right to Quality Care in Sub- Saharan Africa\\" report based on a synthesis of eight assessments of the implementation of the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children in Benin, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Biography  Lovers at the Well (date unknown) His father was an official with the local health department. He began his education at the Coll√®ge Notre-Dame in Nantes. In 1875, after working as a private tutor, he became a Professor in Quimper. Six years later, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under Jean-Paul Laurens.Biography and appreciation by Janet Whitmore @ Rehs Galleries. From 1883 to 1884, he took further lessons in the studio of Alexandre Cabanel. Finding himself attracted to the works of the Flemish masters, he took a study trip to the Netherlands in 1886. It was at that time he began signing his name \\"Jan\\", instead of \\"Jean\\". Upon his return, he married Fanny Julien, a pianist he had met while studying at the √âcole, and they decided to settle in his hometown, leasing property there and planting a small vineyard to help defray expenses. Despite his relatively isolated location, he continued to exhibit regularly at the Salon and won several medals there as well as at the Exposition Universelle (1900). He was posthumously admitted to the Legion d'honneur in 1905.Dossier @ the Base L√©onore. Four years later, his friend Roland Knoedler (an American art dealer), commissioned Antoine Bourdelle to create a monument in his honor. Unfortunately, it was destroyed during World War II.

A graduate of Princeton College, Conkling was admitted to the bar, then moved to Springfield, Illinois. There, he became a prominent Whig, serving first as mayor and later in the Illinois House of Representatives. In 1856, he became one of the first Republicans in the state, attending the Bloomington Convention with Abraham Lincoln. Twice a presidential elector, Conkling was a State Agent during the Civil War and returned to the Illinois House in 1866. Later in his life he was a postmaster and a trustee of the University of Illinois. Biography James Cook Conkling was born in New York City, New York on October 13, 1816. He attended Princeton College and graduated in 1835. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar of New Jersey. He moved to Springfield, Illinois in 1838, where he formed a law partnership with Cyrus Walker. He later partnered with future United States Senator James Shields. In 1844, Conklin was elected Mayor of Springfield as a Whig. He was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives during the 1850‚Äì52 term to replace Ninian Wirt Edwards. Conkling was one of four delegates, including Abraham Lincoln, from Sangamon County, Illinois, at the 1856 Bloomington Convention. This was the first official organization of the Republican Party in the state. He was named to its State Central Committee, responsible for overseeing the campaign in the state that year. He was a presidential elector for the Republicans in 1860 and 1864, casting votes for Lincoln. He delivered the dedication address at the opening of the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. During the Civil War, Governor Richard Yates appointed Conkling a State Agent, responsible for settling claims of the state against the U.S. government for equipping volunteers. In 1863, he read what would become known as the \\"Conkling Letter\\", an address written by Lincoln, at a mass gathering in Springfield. Conkling was elected to the Illinois House for another two-year term in 1866. He authored the bill that would authorize the construction of a new Illinois State Capitol building.

The trio would briefly become a Quartet in 1932 when violinist Dimitrios Semsis joined soon after the quartet would return to a trio when Lambros Leondaridis left the group some time in 1932. Background Roza Eskenazi started her career sometime in the 1920s as a solo performer where she would sing for patrons of the clubs in Greek, Turkish, and Armenian. It was in the club scene where she was first \\"discovered\\" by well-known composer and impresario Panagiotis Toundas in the late 1920s. Toundas immediately recognized her talent and introduced her to Vassilis Toumbakaris of Columbia Records. Roza, in 1929, cut four sides for Columbia, three of which were amanedes (Tzivaeri, Minore, and Matzore) and one demotic (Emorfi Pou Ein I Leivadia). It was around 1929 when Rosa first met Oudist; Agapios Tomboulis. Tomboulis began playing for Roza on the club scene for the rest of 1929. The following year they both met Classical kemen√ße player Lambros Leondaridis, after the pair's meeting Leondaridis he began playing with them in the clubs. That year they formed the Smyrna Trio. Early years (1930-32) K. Lambros, R. Eskenazi, A. Tomboulis (Athens, c. 1930) Roza continued recording records for Columbia with Tomboulis and Leondaridis playing the instrumentation on the record tho they were officially a trio Columbia credit the recordings to just Roza. Some of the music was folk songs, especially from Greece and Smyrna (ƒ∞zmir) in Turkey. Her most important contribution to the local music scene, however, was her recordings of Rebetiko and especially the Smyrna school of Rebetiko. She was, almost single-handedly, responsible for the breakthrough of this style into popular culture, and even today her unique sound is still identified with the genre but as they were not credited as a trio Agapios Tomboulis and Lambros Leondaridis were over shadowed as to their contribution to the genre becoming into popular culture.

Biography Cameron was a younger son of Alexander Cameron of Inverailort, Argyllshire, and was born there in 1781. On 22 October 1797 he received a commission as ensign in the Breadalbane Fencibles, and in 1799 he volunteered to serve with the 92nd Highlanders in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, and received an ensigncy in that regiment. In 1800, when the Rifle Brigade, then known as the 95th Regiment, was raised, Cameron volunteered, and was promoted lieutenant in it on 6 September 1800. In the same year he was present at the Battle of Copenhagen, and in 1801 he volunteered to serve with his former regiment, the 92nd Highlanders, in Egypt, and was severely wounded in the arm and side in the battle of 13 March. He then returned to England, and rejoined the Rifles, and was trained with the other officers in the Shorncliffe Army Camp by Sir John Moore, who secured his promotion to the rank of captain on 6 May 1800. He served with his battalion in Lord Cathcart's expedition to Hanover in 1805, and in the Battle of Copenhagen, and was present at the action of Kioge. In 1808 he was ordered to Portugal with Anstruther's brigade, and was present at the Battle of Vimeiro. During the retreat of Sir John Moore he was continually engaged with the rest of the reserve in covering the retreat. He especially distinguished himself at the affair of Cacabelos and the Battle of Corunna, at both of which he commanded two companies of his battalion. In May 1809 he was again ordered to Portugal, and on reaching Lisbon his battalion was brigaded, with the 43rd and 52nd Regiments, into the celebrated Light Brigade, under the command of Robert Craufurd, which made its famous forced march in July, and joined the main army the day after the Battle of Talavera. From January to June 1810 Craufurd's advanced position on the Coa was one of extreme danger, and Cameron distinguished himself in many emergencies, and in the action, 24 June 1810, held the bridge with two companies against the French army until Major Macleod of the 43rd came to his assistance. In the retreat on Busaco he commanded the rear companies of the Light Brigade, which covered the retreat. He commanded the outposts during the time when Mass√©na remained at Santarem, and in the pursuit after that marshal succeeded to the command of the left wing of the rifles, after the fall of Major Stuart at Foz d'Aronce, and twice led it into action at Casal Nova and at Sabugal. The Light Brigade had during the occupation of the lines of Torres Vedras become the Light Division by the addition of two regiments of Portuguese ca√ßadores, and as a wing of the rifles was attached to each brigade, Cameron's command was of proportionate importance, and he was specially recommended by Lord Wellington for the brevet rank of major, to which he was gazetted on 30 May 1811. During the Siege of Almeida and at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro he commanded a detachment of two hundred picked sharpshooters and half a troop of horse artillery, with the special duty of preventing supplies from entering the place, and during the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo he commanded the left wing of the rifles at the outposts and the covering party during the storm on 18 January 1812. At the siege of Badajoz he was specially thanked in general orders, with Colonel Williams of the 60th, for repulsing a sortie, and on the night of the assault he again commanded the covering party. On the death of Major O'Hare he succeeded to the command of the battalion, and led it into the city. He received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy and the vacant regimental majority on 27 April and 14 May 1812. He then succeeded to the command of the 1st Battalion, which was again united, on the 2nd Battalion rifles joining the division, and kept it in such perfect condition that it became a model to Wellington's whole army. This battalion he commanded at the Battle of Salamanca, and in the advance to Madrid, and with it covered Hill's retreat along the left bank of the Tagus. He had the mortification of being superseded in his command of the battalion by the arrival of Lieutenant-Colonel Norcott in May 1813, and so was only present at the Battle of Vittoria as a regimental major, where he was so severely wounded that he had to return to England. Towards the close of 1813 he was selected for the command of a provisional battalion of rifles, which was sent to Flanders to serve in Sir Thomas Graham's expedition, and he commanded it at Merxem, when he was thanked in the general orders and mentioned in despatches, and before Antwerp. At the conclusion of peace he received a Gold Medal and two clasps for having commanded a battalion at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and Salamanca, and was made a CB. When war again broke out in 1815, he accompanied the 1st Battalion rifles to Belgium as regimental major, and commanded the light companies of Kempt's brigade of Picton's division at Quatre Bras, and his battalion at the Battle of Waterloo, from the period of Barnard's wound until the close of the day, when he was himself wounded in the throat. Cameron saw no more active service, and his latter years are marked only by promotions and honours. In October 1815 he was made a knight of the Russian Order of St Anne; in 1830 he was promoted colonel; in 1832 he was appointed deputy-governor of St. Mawes; in 1838 he was promoted major-general, and made a KCB; in 1846 he received the colonelcy of the 74th Regiment. On 26 July 1850 he died at Inverailort.

Spencer began his affiliation with NorthShore LIJ (now Northwell Health)Huntington Hospital, where he currently serves as Chief of Otolaryngology. In 2000, he opened his own private medical practice in Huntington NY. Dr. Spencer is the past president of the Suffolk County Medical Society, an Officer of the American Medical Association, and a Diplomate of the American Board of Otolaryngology,http://www.aboto.org/ABOInternet/VerifyPhysicianCertification?_EVT_NAME=ONVERIFY&_LIST_INDEX=-1&FIRST;_NAME=william&LAST;_NAME=spencer&CITY;=&COUNTRY;=1&STATE;=&POSTAL;_CODE= as well as the National Board of Medical Examiners. Additionally, he is a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery.  Legislative career  In November 2011, William R. Spencer won his first term as Suffolk County Legislator of the 18th Legislative District, and was re-elected for additional terms in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. As the first physician to serve on the legislature, maintaining public health and crafting science-based public policy has been a main focus for Legislator Spencer. As a member of the Suffolk County Legislature, he currently serves as Chair of the Health Committee, Vice Chair of the Ways & Means Committee, and as a member of the Public Safety Committee. =Key Legislation=  Water Quality and Aquifer Protection  During his first term, Legislator Spencer was able to secure more than $4,500,000 in funding to upgrade Northport‚Äôs Sewage Treatment Plant. Legislator Spencer was the lead sponsor in Suffolk County for IR 1565-2013, which created the Long Island Commission on Aquifer Protection (LICAP) a joint initiative between Nassau and Suffolk Counties to protect Long Island‚Äôs sole-source aquifer. In 2014, Legislator Spencer introduced and passed legislation to further strengthen Suffolk County laws protecting residents from the dangers of hydraulic fracturing waste. IR 1117-2014 prohibits the introduction of hydro-fracking waste into all waste water treatment facilities in the county, prohibits the sale of hydro-fracking waste in Suffolk, and prohibits the application of such waste on all roadways and properties in Suffolk.  Energy Drinks  In March 2013, Legislator Spencer passed the first in the nation comprehensive energy drink action plan. This three part plan, which aims to protect Suffolk County's youth from the dangers of caffeine toxicity associated with energy drinks, prohibits direct marketing of energy drinks to minors, prohibits the sale and distribution of energy drinks to minors in county parks, and created \\"The Truth about Stimulant Drinks\\" public education campaign and PSA contest. . Since Legislator Spencer's legislation passed, this topic has gained increased advocacy and national attention. The guidelines and restrictions enacted by Suffolk County have been adopted as recommendations by the Suffolk County Medical Society, the New York State Medical Society, and the American Medical Association. In July 2013, Legislator Spencer was invited to testify at the United States Senate Commerce Committee by Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, to discuss his insights on the dangers of energy drink consumption and marketing. In April 2014, he was invited to present as a guest lecturer at the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at Yale University to discuss his experience with the powerful energy drink lobby, and how to develop and garner support for effective public health policy.  Tobacco 21  In 2014, Suffolk County joined the growing list of municipalities across the nation passing laws to increase the tobacco purchasing age in Suffolk County to 21. IR 1039-2014, sponsored by Legislator Spencer, prohibits the sale of all traditional and non-traditional tobacco products to individuals under 21. Such products include cigarettes, chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes, liquid nicotine, rolling papers, and smoking apparatuses.  Powdered Caffeine  In late 2014, Legislator Spencer co-sponsored a resolution with his colleague, Presiding Officer DuWayne Gregory to ban the sale of powdered caffeine to minors in Suffolk County. The highly potent substance, which is nearly 100% caffeine, has been linked to at least 2 deaths in the United States. After the passage of the legislation, Dr. Spencer joined a group of advocates to meet with the FDA and five US Senators and discuss the dangers posed by powdered caffeine products. Since the delegation, the FDA has taken action against the five distributors, warning them that product as labeled is hazardous and that appropriate measures must be taken to clarify safe dosage.  Reduction of Single Use Plastic Bags  In 2016, Legislator Spencer led the way in reducing the consumption of single-use carry out bags in Suffolk County, NY. https://suffolkcountyny.gov/Portals/0/FormsDocs/health/PublicHealthProtection/Legislation%20Resolution.pdf During the time he was working on the legislation, the vast majority of the nearly 1 trillion single-use carry out bags consumed every year worldwide, were not recycled and only used for an average on 12 minutes. http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2014/update123 The bags litter roads, become stuck in storm drains, pollute waterways and harm and kill marine and wildlife. https://suffolkcountyny.gov/Portals/0/FormsDocs/health/PublicHealthProtection/Website%20Enviromental%20Impactsv3.pdf After receiving bipartisan support from the Suffolk County Legislature, the law went into effect in January of 2018. https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/12/18/suffolk-county-plastic-bag-fee-2/ In the first 6 months, the legislation successfully reduced single-use carry-out bags by 80% through enacting a 5 cent fee on carry-out bags; incentivizing shoppers to BYOB (bring your own bag). https://www.newsday.com/business/suffolk-nickel-plastic-bag-fee- reusable-1.24755898  Food Allergy Awareness  With 15 million Americans affected by food allergies, and nearly half of all fatal reactions being caused by foods purchased outside the home, Legislator Spencer partnered with local families to pass a law to improve allergy safety and awareness at restaurants in Suffolk County. https://www.foodallergy.org/sites/default/files/migrated-files/file/facts- stats.pdf The Suffolk County, ‚ÄúFood Allergy Friendly Program‚Äù, requires food service establishments to include a notice on all menus asking patrons to inform their server of any food allergies prior to placing their order. In addition to the mandatory requirement, the bill invites restaurants to voluntarily take further safety measures, in order to hold the designation ‚ÄúFood Allergy Friendly‚Äù. Those measures include: displaying extra signage in the staff area, having a manager certified in food allergen safety on duty at all times, and maintaining an ingredient list for all food items available on site which can be available for diners upon request. https://apps2.suffolkcountyny.gov/legislature/resos/resos2017/i1452-17.pdf Arrest/charges On October 20, 2020, Dr. Spencer \\"was arrested Tuesday in a sting operation after allegedly trying to swap pills for sexual favors, according to a report.\\" https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/long-island-politician- caught-trying-to-swap-drugs-for-sexual-favors/ References  External links  * Suffolk County Legislature Website Category:Suffolk County, New York politicians Category:County legislators in New York (state) Category:1967 births Category:Living people ","title":"William R.

A new 511 S/L Bty was formed for the regiment in late 1940. Initially it was attached to the 40th (Sherwood Foresters) S/L Rgt and remained in 39 AA Bde, coming under command of 30th (Surrey) S/L Rgt from 8 January (when it was considered operationally active) until 12 May 1941, when it rejoined 58th S/L Rgt. The battery permanently joined 30th (Surrey) S/L Rgt in early 1942.30 S/L Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7780. The regiment also supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 233rd S/L Training Rgt at Saighton Camp where it provided the basis for a new 539 S/L Bty formed on 12 December 1940. This battery later joined a newly-forming 88th S/L Rgt. In 1941 the searchlight layout over the Midlands was reorganised, so that any hostile raid approaching the Gun Defended Areas (GDA) around the towns must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased.Routledge, p. 399. =344th Battery= On 19 April 1943, 344th Bty received orders to train for a mobile role, and after this training it joined 100 AA Bde on 30 June. 100 AA Bde was one of the formations slated to participate in Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy planned for 1944) and shortly afterwards the battery became formally independent of 58 S/L regiment.344 S/L Bty War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11549. 344th Independent S/L Bty proceeded to Normandy in July 1944 where it pioneered the use of searchlights to create artificial moonlight, otherwise known as movement light or 'Monty's Moonlight', to aid movement in night operations by 21st Army Group.Routledge, p. 314. In February 1945 it changed its title to 344th Independent Moonlight Bty and split off a separate 581st Independent Moonlight Battery.344 M/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5095. =Operation Diver= Meanwhile, the rest of 58th S/L Regt (425 and 426 Btys) had remained with AA Command. In May 1944 it was joined by 314 (Kent) S/L Bty from 29th (Kent) S/L Rgt. Then on 1 June E Troop of 372 S/L Bty of 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment) S/L Rgt joined and became E Trp of 425 S/L Bty. Soon after D Day in June 1944 the bombardment of London by German V-1 flying bombs began, and AA Command was engaged in the efforts to combat them (Operation Diver). Much of AA Command's strength was repositioned on the South Coast of England to engage the V-1s as they came in over the sea. In the centre of the line at Dungeness were four Z Batteries, each of 64 twin 3-inch rocket- launchers. Z Batteries defending towns were by 1944 largely manned by shifts of part-time members of the Home Guard, but for these frontline batteries the detachments were provided by 58th S/L Regiment, which had been hastily trained in the new role.Pile.Routledge, p. 413. The most severe phase of V1 attacks on the UK ended in September 1944 after the launching sites were overrun by the advance of 21st Army Group along the coast of France and Belgium.Routledge, p. 415. =Infantry role= By the end of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted and the War Office began reorganising surplus anti-aircraft regiments in the UK into infantry battalions for duties in the rear areas.Routledge, p. 421. 58th Searchlight Regiment was one of the units selected for conversion, and on 9 November 1944 it was ordered to convert, being redesignated 58th (Middlesex) Garrison Regiment, RA. (314 Searchlight Bty became independent and eventually rejoined 29th S/L Rgt.) Meanwhile, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. In January 1945, the War Office accelerated the conversion of surplus artillery into infantry units, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39‚Äì45 58 Garrison Regiment was redesignated again, becoming 611 (Middlesex) Infantry Regiment, RA in February. It went to North West Europe the following month and did duty with Second Army until after VE Day. It was placed in suspended animation on 31 October 1945.Frederick, p. 881.Joslen, p. 463. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 the regiment reformed as 593 (Middlesex) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA at Harrow, ('mixed' indicating that it was composed partly of members of the Women's Royal Army Corps). Its title was later changed to 593 (Harrow) HAA Regiment.Frederick, p. 1025.592-638 Rgts at British Army 1945 on. It was assigned to 82 AA Bde based at Heston67-106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947.Litchfield, Appendix 5. On 10 March 1955 Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded, and many of its TA regiments were reduced: 593 HAA Regiment was placed in suspended animation, and completely disbanded on 4 July that year. Badge During 1941, the regiment adopted as its arm badge a blue Cornflower embroidered on a khaki disc. The cornflower is the traditional buttonhole worn by supporters of Harrow School at the Eton-Harrow match, the annual cricket match against Eton College held at Lord's Cricket Ground. The regiment and its successors continued to wear the badge until disbandment in 1955. Notes References * Maj L. F.

Unveiled during a Samsung press conference at IFA Berlin on September 3, 2014 alongside its sister, the Galaxy Note 4, it is distinguished by a display that curves across the right side of the device, which can be used as a sidebar to display application shortcuts, notifications, and other information.  Development and release  At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, Samsung presented \\"Youm\\"‚Äîconcept prototypes for smartphones that incorporated flexible displays. One prototype had a screen curved along the right edge of the phone, while the other had a screen curved around the bottom of the phone. Samsung explained that the additional \\"strip\\" could be used to display additional information alongside apps, such as notifications or a news ticker. The Youm concept would surface as part of the Galaxy Note Edge, which was unveiled alongside the Galaxy Note 4 on September 4, 2014. Samsung strategist Justin Denison explained that the company liked to take risks in its products, going on to say that \\"We're not a company that does one-offs [..] We like to do things big and get behind it.\\" Specifications =Hardware and design= The Galaxy Note Edge is similar in design to the Galaxy Note 4 (which is in turn an evolution of the Galaxy Note 3), with a metallic frame and a plastic leather rear cover. The device features either an Exynos 5 Octa 5433(South Korea Version) or Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (International Version) system-on-chip, 3 GB of RAM, and 32 or 64 GB of expandable storage. As with other Galaxy Note series devices, it includes an S Pen stylus which can be used for pen input, drawing, and handwriting. The S Pen had been given a small upgrade with the Note Edge. Similarly to other recent Samsung flagship devices, it also includes a heart rate sensor and fingerprint scanner. The Galaxy Note Edge features a 5.6-inch \\"Quad HD+\\" Super AMOLED display, which contains an additional 160 pixel wide column that wraps around the side of the device on a curve. The device includes a 16 megapixel rear camera with a back-illuminated sensor, optical image stabilization, and 4K video recording, and a 3.7 megapixel front-facing camera. =Software= The Galaxy Note Edge ships with Android 4.4.4 \\"KitKat\\" and Samsung's TouchWiz interface and software suite, and is similar to that of the Note 4. The curved edge of the screen is used as a sidebar for various purposes: it can be used to display different panels, including shortcuts to frequent applications, displays of notifications, news, stocks, sports, social networks, playback controls for the music and video players, camera controls, data usage, and minigames. Tools are also available through the panel, including a ruler, stopwatch, timer, voice recorder, and flashlight button. A software development kit is available for developers to code panels; additional panels can be obtained through Galaxy Apps. The \\"Night Clock\\" mode allows the edge screen to, during a pre-determined timeframe, display a digital clock while not in use. Due to the nature of AMOLED displays, which render black by not turning on the pixel at all, this mode does not significantly consume battery power, but per software limitations it cannot be active for more than 12 hours at a time.

Life He was the third son of General Frederick William Buller of Pelynt and Lanreath in Cornwall, who had himself served with distinction in the 57th Foot in the Netherlands and the West Indies. George was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade on 2 March 1820. The first twenty-five years of his career in the army were spent in a time of peace, and his marriage with Henrietta, daughter of General Sir John Macdonald, Adjutant-General to the Forces, helped his rapid promotion. He became lieutenant in March 1825; captain, in August 1828; major, in December 1830; lieutenant-colonel in August 1835; and colonel in November 1841. In February 1847, he joined his battalion at the Cape. The first Kaffir War had just broken out, and Buller was at once appointed to the command of a brigade, and eventually of the 2nd Division. In September 1847 he was appointed second in command to Sir George Berkeley in the campaign in the Amatola mountains, in which his battalion chased Sandilli so hotly that the chief surrendered to Buller on 19 October. He was gazetted Companion of the Order of the Bath in December 1847. In 1848 he served under Sir Harry Smith in the War against Pretorius, and on 29 August led the attack on the Boomplaats, where he was severely wounded, and had his horse killed under him. His battalion now came home, but in 1852 he was again ordered to go with his regiment to the Cape. At the head of a brigade in General Somerset's division he burnt the kraals in the Waterkloof in the Second Kaffir War, and was present at the Battle of Berea, where he was publicly thanked by Sir George Cathcart, and eventually succeeded Somerset in the command of his division in August 1852. In October 1853, Buller's battalion was again ordered home, and in spite of Sir George Cathcart's entreaties that he would remain as a brigadier at the Cape, he insisted on accompanying it. When it was decided to send an expeditionary army to the East in 1854, Buller was appointed brigadier-general, and took the command of the 2nd Brigade of the Light Division, consisting of the 19th, 88th, and 77th Regiments. His conduct at the Battle of the Alma was severely criticised at the time, but was approved by military writers looking back at the war. At the Battle of Inkerman he was severely wounded in the left arm. He was promoted to major-general in December 1854, and made Knight Commander of the Bath on 6 July 1855. He had to return home, owing to his wound, in March 1855. He married Henrietta MacDonald 22 October 1855 at St John's Church, St John Lee, near Hexham in Northumberland.Parish marriage register held at Northumberland Record Office He commanded the division in the Ionian Isles from 1856 to 1862, and was made colonel-commandant of the Rifle Brigade in 1860, and promoted lieutenant-general in 1862. He commanded the troops of the Southern District at Portsmouth from 1865 to 1870, was made Knight Grand Cross of the Bath in 1869, and promoted full general in 1871. He was a commander of the Legion of Honour, and knight of the second class of the Order of the Medjidie. He died at his house in Bruton Street on 12 April 1884, at the age of eighty-two.

He attended the √âcole cantonale d'art de Lausanne, graduating in 1998. Aragno has made several short films, including Dimanche (his graduation film, selected for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival), Le Jeu (2003), and Autoure de Claire (2010).

To create certain effects in the 3D film, Aragno built his own camera rig in order to allow the 3D image to appear as a double exposure in each of the spectators eyes. This effect has been called innovative and a new addition to cinematic techniques. Aragno said that he \\"made a couple of tests with friends at their home of a boy and a girl‚Ä¶I asked the boy to go to the kitchen on my right, and the right camera followed him and the left stayed, so the 3-D broke. The girl is in your left eyes and the boy on the right. When he was in the kitchen, your brain didn‚Äôt know how to watch. It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3-D.\\" In 2012, Radio T√©l√©vision Suisse (RTS) employed him as director on a documentary film about Godard, one of a 10-part series on Swiss directors.

It was at one time Italy's largest Maoist group, until it changed affiliation and sided with Albania. History The party was founded in 1963 as the Italian Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Movement. It was renamed Communist Party of Italy (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) in 1966. Its founders were from a group of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist communists, who abandoned the Italian Communist Party led by Luigi Longo for its \\"revisionist\\" political line. The founders of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) criticized and accused the PCI of \\"revisionism\\" (because the executives of Italian Communist Party accepted the thesis of Khrushchev that denigrated Stalin in the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) and to follow a parliamentarist and reformist political line. The secretary of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) was Fosco Dinucci. Only the persons who showed to know the thought of Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao and who actively devoted himself to the cause of the Proletarian Revolution, could join the party. The Communist Party of Italy (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) declared its opposition to the parliamentary bourgeois democracy. For the revolutionary activists of the PCd'I (m-l), the only way was the Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, to realize also in Italy the communism through the nationalization of the means of production and of exchange, the economy of state planned. In 1968, when the ideological clash between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China was to the peak, the PCd'I (m-l) was recognized as Italian reference by the PCC and by the Party of Labour of Albania. Such recognition became official in August 1968. Osvaldo Pesce and Dino Dini went in delegation to Peking and met Mao and other important Chinese executives. The meeting was immortalized in a photo published by the newspaper Nuova Unit√†, in which the two Italian representatives were seen together with the Chinese executives. In 1969 a radical faction (led by Giovanni Scuderi) broke away from the party and founded the Italian Marxist-Leninist Party. In 1977, however, after the Sino- Albanian split, the party sided with Albania. The party published a daily newspaper called Nuova Unit√† (New Unity) and a weekly called Voice della Cella (Voice from the Cell). In 1991 the PCd'I (m-l) joined Communist Refoundation Party.

George W. Howard, former Vice President of the American Railway Union, was the creator of the American Industrial Union. The American Industrial Union (AIU) was a short-lived American labor organization launched in April 1895 in Chicago by George W. Howard, formerly of the American Railway Union. The organization was an attempt to construct an industrial trade union encompassing workers from a multitude of crafts into a single labor organization. Several locals of the AIU were established in Chicago, with a total membership of approximately 500. Efforts to join forces with the ARU proved unsuccessful and the union died a quiet death late in 1895 or early in 1896. Organizational history =Establishment= Initial conversations about establishing a new industrial union to be known as the American Industrial Union (AIU) began in March 1895, with news reports at the end of that month indicating that former US Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, a friend of the organized labor movement, had been approached with an offer to be made head of the new organization.\\"The Latest Plan: Cooperation of Production and Distribution Now to Be Tried,\\" Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, March 31, 1895, pg. 6. Trumbull would decline the offer, leaving its chief originator, former Vice President of the American Railway Union (ARU) George W. Howard to serve as the public face of the new organization. The AIU was officially launched on April 21, 1895, at a meeting of 35 delegates held in Chicago through Howard's initiative.\\"American Industrial Union: Organization with Unlimited Aims Begins Its Existence,\\" Chicago Inter Ocean, April 22, 1895, pg. 5. Howard proclaimed the ARU to be defunct in the aftermath of the failed 1894 Pullman strike and characterized the new union as a logical successor to the ARU's effort to build a mass industrial organization. A new constitution, written by Howard, C.E. Ward, and James Nugent, was read to the assembly ‚Äî a process taking a full hour and about which there was no discussion permitted. Heated debate followed, with one newspaper account indicating that dissidents \\"argued that it was preposterous to rush through a constitution in a few minutes which was supposed to contain the underlying principles of the industrial structure of America.\\" A majority of those gathered were Howard loyalists, however, and the constitution was rapidly approved seriatim, with votes on the various sections approved in rapid succession. Debate turned to a letter about the new organization written by Eugene V. Debs, with some seeking to have the correspondence filed without reading while others insisting on the document being read. As the new union had been conceived while Howard and Debs were incarcerated together at McHenry County Jail earlier in the year, the views of ARU President Debs about the AIU ‚Äî positive or negative ‚Äî were deemed important for the future of the new organization. After a vote, the Debs letter was read. Debs declined to participate in the AIU, asserting his continued allegiance to the American Railway Union and casting its future prospects in highly optimistic terms. The AIU patterned itself after the American Railway Union but with a goal of establishing national labor bureaus throughout the United States and seeing to the implementation of the 8-hour day by September 1, 1897.\\"A New Venture: American Industrial Union, the Latest Labor Society, Born in Chicago,\\" Belvidere [IL] Standard, April 24, 1895, pg. 2. The preamble to the organization's constitution called for expansion of the principle of cooperation, the establishment of postal savings banks, and universal suffrage for women. No political party was endorsed, with union members encourage to continue to support the candidates and parties of their own choosing.\\"Labor's New Organization: Aims and Expectations of the American Industrial Union,\\" Edwardsville [IL] Intelligencer, May 3, 1895, pg. 2. The AIU rather fantastically claimed a membership of 5,000 at the time of its launch, with most of its adherents said to come from the ranks of telegraphers. A more reasonable estimate may be extrapolated from another contemporary press report indicating a membership of about 300 for Local Union No. 1, the first and most important chapter of the organization, which ultimately had three locals in Chicago.\\"New Union of Labor: American Industrial Union Just Formed at Chicago,\\" Warren [PA] Evening Democrat, April 25, 1895, pg. 5. A national convention to perfect the organization was slated for January 1896. =Structure= The AIU was to be funded by means of $1 initiation fees and annual dues, with the April convention following the American Railway Union in setting an annual fee of $1.\\"A New Labor Organization,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 28, 1895, pg. 36. The organization declared that it would not conduct strikes nor build a fund for striking workers, but rather expressed its intention to use its surplus funds for the support of various cooperative colonies which were being established in the United States. Membership was open to all save for representatives of monopolistic corporations without regard to religion, race, or gender. J.H. Copeland, a lawyer, was selected by the April 1895 organizing convention as the President of the AIU, with George W. Howard chosen as General Secretary. The AIU was headed by a ten-member board of directors which included a President, two Vice Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer. Those elected included: * A.J. Arkin * J.H. Copeland * S.H. Herbeson * George W. Howard * W.I. Howard * George Muller * James Nugent * R.H. Rogers * C.E. Ward * W.W. Welsh =Development= After its April 1895 launch, the American Industrial Union met each Sunday in Chicago, with a nucleus of about 40 members regularly attending these Sunday sessions.\\"Leaders in a Fight: Stormy Meeting of American Industrial Union,\\" Chicago Inter Ocean, May 13, 1895, pp. 1-2. These gatherings were soon marked by factionalism, however, with one May 1895 session garnering front page headlines when General Secretary Howard was challenged by local Knights of Labor activist August E. Gans for having solely authored the organization's constitution and forcing its passage in unaltered form. \\"If anyone does not agree exactly with your pet schemes, you brand him an obstructionist,‚Äù Gans is reported to have said, adding, \\"you want everything your own way.\\" Howard erupted in fury at \\"such personal attacks,\\" declaring, \\"I will settle this with you outside.\\" While no fisticuffs actually resulted, the young union's effort to project itself as stable and harmonious was severely undercut by the acrimony. At least three \\"Local Unions\\" of the AIU were established in Chicago by the middle of May 1895. Out on bail after serving just 17 days of his 3 month jail sentence for contempt of court in association with the Pullman Strike, on June 10, 1895, General Secretary Howard was notified that he and the other convicted leaders of the American Railway Union would have to return to jail for the completion of their terms following a refusal of the United States Supreme Court to overturn their convictions.\\"Go to Jail Today: Eugene V. Debs and His Associates to Begin Their Terms,\\" Chicago Inter Ocean, June 11, 1895, pg. 10. While Debs and the other ARU leaders were returned to Woodstock Jail, owing to strained relations over the AIU Howard was allowed to complete his sentence in another Illinois county jail,\\"Debs Did Not Report In Time,\\" New York Times, June 12, 1895, pg. 5. serving his final 73 days at the Will County Jail in Joliet, Illinois. Extension of the AIU was hampered by its leader's removal from activity during this time. Attendance at local meetings soon flagged and while hope was held out that popular orator Eugene Debs of the ARU would fully embrace the AIU, no firm endorsement would follow. The simultaneous release of former ARU Vice President Howard from Joliet and all other directors of the ARU (except Debs) from Woodstock on August 22 was met with an explicit denial of any intention to join forces of the two organizations by ARU director William Burns.\\"In the World Again: Release of the Directors of the American Railway Union,\\" Decatur [IL] Herald, Aug. 23, 1895, pg. 5. Burns declared that \\"to all inquiries of this sort we have invariably answered that we know nothing about the American Industrial Union. We think we are a sufficiently big tub to stand on our own bottom.\\" Instead the ARU announced its plan to reorganize on the basis of a secret society in an effort to avoid the blacklisting of its members by railroad corporations and a renewed effort to build the ARU as an industrial union of railway workers. =Termination= The AIU attempted to wield influence upon the Democratic Party at its 1896 National Convention, dispatching a three member delegation to Chicago in July to attempt to insert three planks in the party's electoral platform.\\"Union Planks,\\" St. Paul Globe, July 7, 1896, pg. 5. These included such traditional Republican themes as establishment of a protective tariff to help eliminate the deleterious effects of \\"imported goods made by cheap foreign labor\\" and \\"honest money...sufficient in amount to transact the business of the country\\" (a euphemism for gold), as well as a plank calling for arbitration as a means of solving labor disputes. The actual platform only gave a minor tip of the cap to the last of these three proposals, declaring the Democrats to be \\"in favor of the arbitration of differences between employers engaged in interstate commerce and their employees.\\"\\"1896 Democratic Party Platform: July 7, 1896,\\" The American Presidency Project: Political Party Platforms, www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ Unable to join forces with the ARU and its popular leader Eugene Debs or to generate publicity through the launch of cooperative colonies, the AIU seems to have died a quiet death sometime in the second half of 1896. By the end of 1898 the American Federation of Labor could ridicule its former potential rival in unabashedly harsh terms, proclaiming it \\"the greatest fake union ever perpetrated upon the workingmen of this or any other country,\\" which had been populated only by a group of temporary officers- elect, none of whom, the AF of L contended, \\"had ever been known to work for a living\\" except for Secretary Howard, who was \\"a cripple.\\"\\"Withstands All Threats,\\" The American Federationist, vol. 5, no. 11 (Jan. 1899), pg. 226.

It was built in 1922‚Äì1923 By Walter J. Kohler, Sr., then governor of Wisconsin and president of the Kohler Company. It was reported to cost in excess of $1,000,000 to construct ().  History  Kohler commissioned architect Richard Philipp, of the Milwaukee firm of Brust & Philipp, to design the house. Phillip had previously designed a house for Walter's father, John Michael Kohler. Phillip had also previously worked on the Kohler Village for Walter Kohler, designing most of the new structures built from 1916 through the mid-1920s. Kohler commissioned the Olmsted Brothers, well known for creating Central Park in New York City and the Harvard and Stanford campuses, to design the grounds of the estate. The grounds were landscaped in the English tradition to accentuate the natural beauty of the site that captivated Walter and his wife Charlotte. The design of the house and grounds was inspired during trips that they made to Great Britain and Europe. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Riverbend was a gathering place for social occasions. Walter and Charlotte entertained their guests on a grand scale. Walter Kohler died in 1940 and his Charlotte died in 1947. In 1948 The property was purchased by his son, John Michael Kohler III, and his wife Julilly House Kohler. John and Julilly would continue the tradition opening the house to the public and of hosting large events. John Kohler died in 1968 and Julilly died in 1976. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The house was acquired from Walter's descendants by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Kohler Co. in turn purchased Riverbend in 1985 from the Trust. The house sat empty for about 15 years until the restoration effort was begun in March 2000. The home was expanded and remodeled with a four-story addition added at the east end, and opened in 2001 as an exclusive private membership club. The house currently features 31 guest rooms, two dining rooms, solarium, living room, Rathskeller, meeting rooms, spa with treatment areas, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, and an indoor-outdoor year- round swim-through pool.  Architecture  = House = The house is a prime example of Tudor Revival architecture. The house was considered architecturally significant enough that it was included in the book Great Houses of America along with 29 other houses such as Monticello, Biltmore, The Breakers, and Lyndhurst. The house was notable, partly because unlike most Tudor Revival homes constructed in the time period, it was not designed with a modern interior. There was much effort to use typical old-world materials and craftsmanship in the construction. The house as constructed, was a three-story building with no rigid floor plan and approximately 50 rooms. The exterior is a complex of gables, dormers, hip roofs, turrets and varied offsets. The exterior was primarily brick with varied cut stone insertions in areas such as corners and windows. Some of the faces under the gable ends were finished in a smooth light stucco. The open solarium in the southern facade was surrounded in four-centred archways supporting additional floors of living space above. Many of the windows were divide into triple sections by stone mullions. The interiors, while not a strict reproduction of authentic Tuder style, contained many natural materials like stone and timbers. Other design elements included tiled floors, carved stone fireplaces, and stained glass medallions in the windows. The main door leading into the great hall contained leaded glass divided lites. This large room measured 20 by 42 feet and was paved with Vermont granite slabs, a wooden ceiling supported by cased oak beams, white stucco walls and numerous four-centred arch openings. The main feature of the room is a massive fireplace built of carved Madison sandstone. Many of the rooms contained vaulted ceiling and the hallway ceilings were typically varied combinations of different sizes of intersecting vaults. An unusual octagonal circular stairway leads from the second floor to the third. The house was furnished with many antiques such as Kurdistan rugs, William and Mary highback chairs, Flemish tapestries, a Queen Anne bookcase (c. 1719), and a Chippendale chest (c. 1780). Most of the antiques were imported. The fashion in the twenties for interiors emphasized ample draperies and heavy wall hangings. Dark walls and upholstery, furniture in dark woods like Jacobean oak and William and Mary walnut were also common. In the late 1940s after acquiring the house, John and Julilly made changes to bring more light into the house. Changes included lighter curtains around the widows, first floor walls and ceilings painted mostly white, bedrooms in pastel colors or papered, removing heavy draperies and wall hangings and substituting lighter fabrics and colors whenever possible. The original house had in excess of 28,000 square feet of floor space. The addition, constructed in 2000‚Äì2001, added more than 10,000 square feet to the house. The addition was constructed with design information from the original architect to be as true to the house as possible. The addition contains four floors, making it taller than the original house but efforts were made to make it match as closely as possible. Restoration work to the original house involved matching many different types of plaster work including repairs to many elaborate detailed ornamental features. Much of the original plaster had to be removed and replaced due to moisture causing the different layers to delaminate. It was estimated that about 80% of the original ceiling detail was saved. Exterior restoration work included replacing much of the original stucco on the gables ends with a modern EIFS in matching textures and colors. = Landscape = The primary elements of the landscaping are rustic stone walls, rock gardens, sunken lawns an all√©e of evergreens, formal beds, and a bowling green. An unusual feature of the landscaping was the focus on an unusual box-elder tree with a span in excess of 100 feet. The longest lower limbs dipped to ground level rooting themselves. A painting of the tree by Charlotte, titled Earthbound, was featured in a gallery display of Wisconsin art sponsored by The Milwaukee Journal, in 1930. The tree began to die in the 1970s and in now gone.

Architecture of Jiangxi refers to the traditional masonry houses, residential compounds, monuments, and academies built in Jiangxi of East China. Overview Fengcheng The architecture of Jiangxi is renowned for its exterior and interior design, relating to the surrounding context and settings by using Fengshui principles. It is defined as an architectural style that the intersections of closely spaced buildings, surrounded by brick walls, form a relatively enclosed courtyard. This kind of enclosure, called \\"Tianjing\\" () is quite similar to the Roman impluvium and serves in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Natural materials are highly preferred. Raw materials, such as stone, wood, and brick, are abundantly used for the respect for nature. Stone, as the fundamental part in the construction, is variable across different regions; sandstone, limestone, granite are the most frequent choices. Wood is generally used for the framework of buildings, because of its warmth and workability. Compared to the style in surrounding regions like Zhejiang or Anhui where outer walls are painted white with quicklime, bricks are explicitly viewed in Jiangxi architecture, which therefore demands well- developed techniques to produce fine bricks. The traditional architectures still preserved in Jiangxi were mostly built during the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. These buildings are characterized by gables of dark bricks, with white lines under eaves, covered by black tiles. They are often elaborately decorated by wood, stone and brick carvings, ink painting, clay sculpture, and sometimes with Nuoxi elements. Architectural features Distinct from its counterparts in surrounding regions, Jiangxi architecture has a series of characteristics that differs from its neighbours' styles in many ways. The exterior of Jiangxi architecture is tall brick walls that dominantly favour the original colour of bricks, with a slight white line painted with quicklime under the roof tiles, but this is done otherwise in Zhejiang and southern Anhui where walls are entirely painted white. (Wuyuan County of Jiangxi and some places around it are consistent with the style of Anhui and Zhejiang) Also, Jiangxi people are used to living on the ground floor within the residence and thus, Jiangxi architecture generally consists of one storey and a half (the half storey is used for storage), whereas architectures of Zhejiang and Anhui are often two-storeyed or even more. Meanwhile, Tulou (commonly called Weiwu in Jiangxi) of Hakka people can be found in the southmost counties of Jiangxi, like Longnan, Quannan, Dingnan, because of the geographic neighbourhood with western Fujian and northern Guangdong.

Despite the small number of surviving buildings, their architectural features genuinely reflect the style of this period. Structural elements like dougong were generally used, and the selection of raw materials was mainly those of big volume. In decorative carvings, animals like elephants, horses, qilin, phoenix are very representative at this time. =17th to 18th century= Jiangxi saw a large regress in economy as well as in other fields during this period due to the warfare and some natural disasters. While earlier style of grandeur could still be perceived, budgets of house building were relatively limited which led to a minimalist style in decoration. Geometric patterns and symbols of goodwill are the main theme of carvings. =19th century to present= Stimulated by a national trend of sophisticated aesthetics and also by improvements of handcraft, Jiangxi architecture evolved into an elaborately- decorated style. Carvings often took much more time than house building, while structural beauty was no longer the focus in architectural design. The use of dougong was largely reduced, and some decorative parts were even coloured with mineral pigments. Fengshui design Fengshui theories have been playing an important role in the entire course of construction, for instance, choosing the site, house direction, etc.. =Jiangxi school= Jiangxi school (), also called Xingshi school () is a prominent school in Chinese Fengshui, which emphasizes the harmony between nature and human, namely between environment and residents. Yang Yunsong () is the founder of this school.

Roughly speaking, sandstone is preferred in western Jiangxi and limestone is usually seen in the east, while granite is typically used in northwestern region. However, the combination of different stones can also be viewed for seeking aesthetics. Stone is elaborately carved, especially at entrance door, column bases and other visible parts inside the building. =Wood carving= As a major aspect in interior decoration, wood carving often costs the most amount of time and money in the construction. In consequence, carpenters are greatly valued and respected. The content of wood carving are often inspired from historical stories or traditional cultures, such as Wufu, Shou, 24 Xiao, etc.. =Brick carving= Brick carving is comparatively less often applied in Jiangxi architecture, however, classic work can still be found. A renowned example is a residence in Yihuang County, built in 1755, and its entire entrance is decorated with finely-carved bricks. =Ink painting= Infrastructure Yanshan, Shangrao =Defensive wall= =Pavement= =Bridge= =Water well= Significant buildings and areas City walls in Ganzhou =Major National Historical and Cultural Sites= *White Deer Grotto Academy, one of the Four Great Academies of China *Traditional Architecture of Liukeng Village *Paifang of Grave of Zhu Shi *Yuanzhou Drum Tower *Ehu Academy *Bailuzhou Academy *Paifang of Chen Family *Qingyunpu, residence of Bada Shanren *Guanyin Bridge *Mingshui Bridge *Fengqu Bridge *Wannian Bridge *Ganzhou City Walls *Wan'an City Walls *Ancestral shrine of Jia family *Longxuetushi Paifang and Cishichuanfang Paifang *Confucian Temple of Anfu *Wanshou Palace of Fuzhou *Yuceshanguan and Yutingbieshu villas *Shiwuli residence of Yiqian Influence on neighbourhood Taining, Fujian Significant migrations from Jiangxi to its neighbouring regions took place several times in the last millennium, which profoundly changed the demographics of these regions. Jiangxi culture, as a consequence, has been spread as far as southwestern China, and this can be witnessed in linguistic aspect as well as in architecture. It is noted that eastern Hunan, southeastern Hubei, southwestern Anhui and northwestern Fujian are the major destinations of historical Jiangxi migrants. Many features of the architecture of Jiangxi are preserved in these regions, although architectural adaptations to local environment should also be taken into account. Zhanguying Village of Hunan is a notable example. Regional variation There are regional variations within Jiangxi architecture. Gan River is regarded as the dividing line, west of which the use of \\"Tianjing\\" (sky well) decreased to such an extent that Tianjing, especially in Ji'an, is primarily used in ancestral shrines to set up some architectural hierarchy. Moreover, architectures in Ji'an tend to be more coloured than other regions in Jiangxi, since wood carvings and clay sculptures are often painted in decoration. As for the architectural framework, wooden beams of a building in the west of Gan River are usually laid directly on the inner walls, instead of on the columns.

On October 3, 1961, 13 African-American first grade students were enrolled in schools that were previously all white. The schools that the students attended were Bruce, Gordon, Rozelle, and Springdale elementary schools. The students attended the following schools: Bruce Elementary (Dwania Kyles, Harry Williams, Michael Willis); Gordon Elementary (Alvin Freeman, Sharon Malone, Sheila Malone, Pamela Mayes); Rozelle Elementary (Joyce Bell, E.C. Freeman, Leandrew Wiggins, Clarence Williams); Springdale Elementary (Deborah Ann Holt; Jacqueline Moore). When these students desegregated Memphis City Schools there was no violence like the violence witnessed in other parts of the South. There was neither a great deal of news coverage nor a great deal of public discussion about what was going on. Rev. Samuel Kyles was the chairman of the local NAACP's education committee at the time noted that the decision to use first-graders instead of high school students was intentional. Kyles believed that first graders were not tainted and therefore were better suited to integrate the schools. The story of the Memphis 13 has been made into a documentary by Professor Daniel Kiel, a professor at the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law. The documentary is 35 minutes and consists of interviews with the 13 students and their family members about their experiences and feelings during the time. In October 2015, historical markers were placed at the four schools students attended. The students have been honored as part of the City of Memphis \\"Be the Dream\\" awards program at Mason Temple in January 2016 and were honored at screenings of the documentary at Harvard Law School, the Little Rock Reel Civil Rights Film Festival, Thurgood Marshall School of Law, and the University of Mississippi School of Law.

It is a scheduled monument. Location The Broch of Borwick is located 8 kilometres southwest of Dounby on Mainland, Orkney. The broch stands on top of a cliff-top promontory 20 metres above the sea. A small stream runs past the site immediately to the east. Description The broch has an external diameter of 17 metres and an internal diameter of 8 metres. The walls which are 3.5 to 5 metres thick currently stand to a maximum height of 2.6 metres. The eastern half of the broch and the entrance passage are well preserved, but the western half has been destroyed by erosion. The entrance passage, which is still lintelled over, is 5.6 metres long with door-checks each formed of a slab set on edge 3 metres from the outside. A guard cell opened off the right of the passage. The broch was once cut off from the flat land beyond by an outer wall, and there were outbuildings between the wall and the broch. Excavations The site was excavated in 1881 by W. G. T. Watt, and the interior was cleared of debris. Ashes, bones and shells mixed with clay were found under the rubble. Beneath this was a layer of small flat stones and under this the broch floor. Finds included several combs, a small whale vertebra cup, a spindle whorl, a stone gaming piece, a whetstone, hammerstones, some stone knives and choppers, an iron rod, and some querns.

In 1881 he began an office manager for the J. B. Schall banjo company, giving banjo lessons and meeting prominent banjo players of the time, including E. M. Hall.Vintage Banjo Maker, J. B. Schall He also began studying the guitar and the mandolin. He became a soloist performer, traveling the country and teaching the banjo, guitar and mandolin. He also composed music and became a music publisher. Places he traveled included Chicago, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Omaha and Kansas City. The Cadenza Partee settled in Kansas City about 1890, where his magazine The Cadenza was published, beginning with the September/October 1894 issue. The Cadenza was \\"the first legitimate, high class magazine devoted to the interests of ... players at large of the banjo, mandolin and guitar.\\" Partee set his own standard, keeping the tone \\"literary\\" and the content educational, and as a result, improved the overall standard for magazines of this type. In an effort to expand his magazine's reach, Partee moved it from the Midwest to the New England area and added content tailored toward the cosmopolitan crowd, with stylish women on the cover and stories of banjo, mandolin and guitar players who had found success and love through their music. He also branched out adding sections to the magazine for voice, violin, harp and piano. Partee chose a non-standard niche for The Cadenza, promoting sheet music rather than specific musical instruments. Another content difference noted by the Musical Journal was that the Cadenza did not devote itself to advertising the owner's merchandise or vilifying his competitors, unlike in other musician-oriented magazines.

A group of 121 tapestries dateable to the late 16th century were produced. Much the most famous are four tapestry maps illustrating the counties of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, with most other tapestries being small furnishing items, such as cushion covers. The tapestries are included in three major collections: the Victoria and Albert Museum, London;Wingfield-Digby, G., The Victoria and Albert Museum, Catalogue of Tapestries Medieval and Renaissance, London 1980, pg.71-83. the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York;Standen, E.A., European post-medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985, nos. 119-124. and the Burrell Collection, Glasgow, Scotland (still uncatalogued). Pieces were first attributed in the 1920s to looms at Barcheston, Warwickshire by a Worcestershire antiquary, John Humphreys, without clear criteria;Humphreys, J., 'Elizabethan Sheldon Tapestries', Archaeologia 74, 1924, pg. 181-202, reprinted as a monograph with the same title, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1929 on a different, but still uncertain basis, others were so classified a few years later.Barnard, E.A.B. and Wace, A,J,B,, ‚ÄòThe Sheldon tapestry weavers and their work‚Äô, Archaeologia 78, 1928, pg. 255-314 No documentary evidence was then, or is now, associated with any tapestry, so no origin for any piece is definitely established.Turner, H.L., \\"Tapestries once at Chastleton House and their influence on the image of the tapestries called Sheldon: a re-assessment\\", The Antiquaries Journal, vol. 88,2008, pg. 313-343, also available on-line. The Sheldon Tapestry Maps These are the four tapestry-woven maps commissioned in the late 1580s by Ralph Sheldon (1537‚Äì1613), based on the county surveys of Christopher Saxton. The tapestries illustrated the counties of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire, with each tapestry portraying one county. Designed to hang together in Ralph Sheldon's home in Weston, near Long Compton, Warwickshire, they would have presented a view across central England, from the Bristol Channel to London, covering the counties where Sheldon‚Äôs family and friends held land. The maps are important in showing the landscape of central England in the 16th century, at a time when modern map making was in early development. Of the original four tapestries, three survive in part and only the Warwickshire one is still complete, now displayed at Market Hall Museum, Warwick. Background Weston House, Long Compton 1716 In 1570 Ralph Sheldon's father, William, laid out plans which would,if successful,set up a new tapestry weaving business in his manor house at Barcheston, Warwickshire. A Flemish tapestry maker, Richard Hyckes, lived there rent-free on condition that he organised the weaving of tapestries and textiles. At the same time Hyckes was working, with the title of arras-maker, in the Great Wardrobe in London, part of the household departments of Queen Elizabeth I. He was head of the team responsible for the care and repair of the 2,500 tapestries inherited from her father King Henry VIII.Campbell, T.P. Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty, Yale University Press, 2007. Ralph Sheldon allowed the business to continue following his father's death; he subsequently commissioned the tapestry maps, though there is no proof that they were woven in Warwickshire. It has been suggested that the size of this project would have required more space and skilled labour than would have been available in Barcheston at that time.Turner, No Mean Prospect: Ralph Sheldon's Tapestry Maps, pg. 38-39 During the English Civil War the Sheldon family supported the Royalist cause, and after the war their lands were confiscated. With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and accession of King Charles II, their lands were returned to them and a second Ralph Sheldon, known as ‚Äòthe Great‚Äô (1623‚Äì1684) commissioned copies of two of the earlier tapestries, those of Oxfordshire and Worcestershire, possibly because the originals had been damaged.Turner, No Mean Prospect, pg. 44 Instead of the detailed imagery of the Elizabethan borders on the four originals these tapestries were woven with a stylised picture frame and classical decorations. The original 16th century border on the Warwickshire map was also replaced in the same style, probably at this time. Design Each of the four tapestry maps measured approximately wide and high and was based on the recent county maps made by Christopher Saxton, which provided information on rivers, towns, and geographical features such as woods and forests. Each tapestry focussed on a single county and the area of tapestry around that county boundary was filled in with details taken from the appropriate adjoining Saxton county maps. To enable the central county to stand out on each tapestry, it was given a pale background and a red border, while the backgrounds of neighbouring counties were woven in contrasting shades. Because it bordered so many other counties, the Oxfordshire tapestry, for instance, included details from nine of Saxton's maps. The tapestry designer had to greatly enlarge the scale since the counties on the Saxton printed maps measured approximately .Turner, No Mean Prospect, pg. 10-18 The tapestries therefore had space to add more detail than Saxton‚Äôs maps, so they include more natural and man-made features of each area, vary the species and style of trees and size of hills and illustrate items such as fire beacons and windmills. Most villages were drawn in a similar style, as houses grouped around a central church, though towns are more varied and shown in more detail so may have been based on more accurate drawings. Coventry was depicted with many church spires surrounded by its defensive walls, and Worcester included the stone arched bridge over the river Severn. All settlements, whatever their size, were identified in black capital letters on a pale background. Numerous private houses were shown, often depicted in detail and indicating the building style of the house. Most had a connection with Sheldon‚Äôs family and friends and the Warwickshire tapestry included Coughton Court, home of Sheldon's wife, as well as the Sheldon properties in Weston, Skiltes and Beoley. Because of the overlap of geographical areas, each of the four tapestries was able to include Sheldon‚Äôs house in Weston which, unlike most of the other houses which were surrounded by fencing, was shown bordered by a hedge. Every tapestry had the arms of Queen Elizabeth in the upper left corner, a panel of text inspired by William Camden's Britannia in the upper right and a scale and dividers in the lower left corner. Each right-hand corner of the tapestry had a coat of arms, representing different generations of the Sheldon family. Gloucestershire shows the arms of Ralph Sheldon (d. 1613) and Anne Throckmorton, Warwickshire shows those of Edward Sheldon (d.1643) and his wife Elizabeth Markham, while the simple Sheldon coat seen on Oxfordshire may represent their son William, born early in 1589. The Elizabethan Worcestershire tapestry lacks its right- hand side so that the arms are missing, but when it was woven a second time it showed those of William Sheldon (d.1570) and his wife Anne Willington. The 17th century Oxfordshire map carries the arms of Ralph 'the Great' Sheldon and his wife Henrietta Maria Savage.Tapestry Maps Portfolio, no author, Victoria and Albert Museum, London c. 1915. Each tapestry was then surrounded by a decorated border approximately deep, which included representations of allegorical and classical figures as well as pieces of text referring to the county depicted.Turner, pg. 30-34 The orientation of the four tapestries is not the same. The tapestry maps of Worcestershire and Oxfordshire have north at the top, while Warwickshire and Gloucestershire were made with north to the left. Dispersal The tapestries remained in the house and in 1738 George Vertue recorded that he had seen the Elizabethan maps and later copies of Oxfordshire and Worcestershire hanging together in the Great Drawing Room in Weston. Thirty years later in 1768 Walpole saw only ‚ÄòThree large maps of Counties in tapestry‚Äô.Walpole‚Äôs Journal, Walpole Soc Annual XVI, 1927-28 In 1781 when the contents of the house were sold, only three pieces were listed, by size, in the entries in Christie's auction catalogue.Christie and Ansell 1781, Sale Catalogue of the property of William Sheldon, Weston, August 28-September 11, 1781 The three tapestries listed are identifiable as the 16th century Warwickshire map with its 17th century border and the two 17th century copies of Oxfordshire and Worcestershire; they were bought by Horace Walpole. He later gave them to Lord Harcourt, who left them to the Archbishop of York and in 1827 they were given to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society who put them on display.Turner, pg. 46-48 In 1897 the Warwickshire tapestry was lent to the new Birmingham museum at its opening, and in 1914 the tapestries were exhibited at an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Because the border around the Warwickshire map had been replaced in the 17th century, it had been assumed that the whole map had also been made at that time.Turner, pg. 47 In 1980 a study of the tapestry revealed that the border had been stitched to the tapestry and not woven with it; this meant that the centre of the tapestry was older, revealing that the Warwickshire map dated from the 16th century and so was the only one of the original four tapestries which was still complete.Turner, H.L. \\"The Sheldon Tapestry Map of Warwickshire\\", Warwickshire History, vol. 12 2002, pg 32-44. Cleaning and conservation of the Warwickshire tapestry was carried out in 2011, prior to its temporary exhibition at the British Museum in 2012. During this treatment the lining was removed from the back where some fragments of the Elizabethan original were found. The original colours could also be seen, bright green and yellow, though on the front of the tapestry these have now faded to blue. Cleaning also highlighted previously hidden details like the many cottages hidden among the trees of the Forest of Arden and the stone circle near Great Rollright, possibly the earliest depiction of the Rollright Stones, Neolithic and Bronze Age megaliths on the Oxford- and Warwickshire border. The Warwickshire tapestry contains a woven date, 1588. It was perhaps meant to commemorate the marriage of Edward Sheldon and Elizabeth Markham in that year rather than being date the tapestry was woven. Current locations The history of the three 16th century maps is more complicated. They were not identifiably listed in the sale catalogue of 1781; probably already damaged, the tapestries of Worcestershire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire were acquired by different owners by unknown means. The antiquarian Richard Gough donated large sections of the Worcestershire and Oxfordshire and smaller fragments of the Gloucestershire tapestries to the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford in 1809. In 2007, the Bodleian Library acquired a further piece of the Gloucestershire tapestry map, costing over ¬£100,000. This, with a companion piece, had first come to light in the 1860sNotes and Queries, Jan- June 1869, 4th series, 606, 540, 428 and re-emerged in 1914;Wingfield-Digby, Catalogue 1981, p. 69. they decorated a fire screen. So too did two other parts of the 16th century Oxfordshire tapestry; they had been in the possession of Horace Walpole and were sold from Strawberry Hill in 1842.Sale Catalogue, Strawberry Hill 1842, day 17, lot 59 and later in the catalogue of a Bristol bookseller called Strong; they were donated in 1954 to the Victoria and Albert Museum.Wingfield-Digby, Catalogue 1981, p. 67. In 1960, the three complete tapestries were sold at Sotheby's, London. Worcestershire was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Oxfordshire tapestry was bought by a private buyer and is now on display at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.Turner, Hilary (2006). \\"Oxfordshire in wool and silk: Ralph Sheldon the Great's tapestry map of Oxfordshire\\" (PDF).

Sony began an upgrade for both the Z3 Compact and the Z3 to Android 5.0 \\"Lollipop\\" and announced upgrades for other Xperia Z devices in March 2015. Starting in July 2015, Sony released an Android 5.1.1 update for the Z2, Z3 and Z3 Compact, with the other Xperia Z devices following shortly after. On 6 October 2015, Sony confirmed that the Xperia Z3 Compact will be updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Sony released the official Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update in April 2016. The bootloader can be unlocked on both Z3 Compact and Z3 in order to install a custom ROM, but will void the warranty and delete the DRM keys, disabling the camera noise reduction feature and access to Sony Entertainment Network. Reception =Critical reception= The Z3 Compact received generally positive reviews, with PC Advisor describing it as a great little smartphone offering everything available on the full-size Z3, with a design that is thinner and lighter with a larger display than the previous Z1 Compact. The Register praised the phone for its outstanding battery life. The Verge praised the Z3 Compact's small size while retaining the excellent battery life and performance specs of the Z3 flagship, drawing an analogy between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus which shared most of their hardware despite the size difference.  Issues/Workarounds  The Z3 Compact has been widely reported to develop two serious issues: # The touchscreen starts to fail at the top and bottom edges; this becomes critical when the virtual back/home/menu navigation buttons stop working. A workaround from the Sony support forum uses Minimal ADB to reduce the usable screen height (adb shell wm overscan 0,30,0,30); another workaround is to use third party virtual button software. # With Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow), Bluetooth blocks deep sleep mode and the battery drains quickly. Turning off Bluetooth is a work- around.

The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was also added to the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey as survey HABS WI-358. History The first lighthouse on this bluff was built in 1855, a structure of Cream City brick with a cast iron lantern room, sited high to make it visible out on Lake Michigan. In the late 1880s it was jeopardized by erosion of the bluff and plans were made to replace it. In 1888 a 40-foot cast-iron lighthouse tower was built 100 feet in from the edge of the bluff, and the Queen Anne-style light keeper's quarters was built. The original 1855 lantern room was used on the new 1888 tower. Eventually trees in the park obstructed the light from the view of ships, so in 1912 the tower was dismantled and a riveted steel addition was erected and the original 1888 section was placed on top raising its height to and light focal plane to . Today it is the only lighthouse in the country built of 3 lighthouses. 1855,1888,1912. The first 1888 lantern burned mineral oil. It was converted to coal gas in 1912 and electrified in 1929.

The hall was built in the first decade of the twentieth century, largely through the efforts of local miners, and continued to play a central role in the life of the valley until destroyed by fire in November 1994. A campaign to develop a Public Hall and Institute at Aberaman dated from 1892 when a public meeting was held in Saron Chapel. Until that point the chapels had been dominant in public life and the development of a secular hall, in hindsight, could be seen as the beginning of their long decline. Many years elapsed before sufficient funds were raised to begin the building work and the ceremony to lay the foundation stone was held on 2 October 1907, on the site previously occupied by the Aberaman Reading Institute. The hall was officially opened by Keir Hardie MP on 14 June 1909. The opening ceremony was a notable event in the history of Aberaman. A carriage arrived carrying D. A. Thomas the Liberal MP for Merthyr Boroughs, Keir Hardie, the Labour MP, William Thomas, High Constable of Aberdare and C. B. Stanton, the miners' agent. At the Institute, the architect, Thomas Roderick, handed Hardie a gold key, suitably inscribed, with which he opened the door of the building. Designed by Thomas Roderick, and built by John Morgan and Son, the hall's facilities, included two billiards rooms, two games rooms, a swimming pool in the basement, Committee Room, a Lending Library and Reference Room, and a Lecture Hall. Its crowning glory was the main auditorium with seating for 1,800 people with a first floor offering additional capacity. Throughout the twentieth century the hall was the social and cultural centre for Aberaman. It was eventually destroyed by fire in November 1994.

Emigrating to the United States with his family when he was a child, Edwards studied at the State Normal School in Bridgewater, Massachusetts and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He then led a number of schools: the Boys' High School in Salem, Massachusetts (1853‚Äì1854); the State Normal School in Salem (1854‚Äì1857); the Normal School in St. Louis, Missouri (1857‚Äì1861); Illinois State Normal University (1862‚Äì1876); and Blackburn University(1891‚Äì1893). From 1887 to 1891, he served as the Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction. Early Life Richard Edwards was born in Lledrod, Wales, on December 23, 1822. The son of Richard and Ann (Jones), Edwards was raised on the family farm until his family immigrated to the United States in 1833, settling in Ohio. In October 1844, Edwards took a teaching job, and after one term he enrolled in the State Normal School in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. He then studied and taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Edwards married Betsey J. Samson on July 5, 1849, and they had nine children together. Edwards graduated from the Bridgewater Normal in 1846 and taught there from 1848 until 1853.  Teaching  In 1848, he returned to the State Normal School in Bridgewater to teach astronomy, physics, map-drawing, and geography. Five years later, he was named principal of the Boys' High School in Salem, Massachusetts, and in 1854, Edwards was named principal of the State Normal School in Salem. In 1857, Edwards agreed to become the principal of the Normal School in St. Louis, Missouri and led the school for four years, then was elected principal of St. Louis High School. He received an honorary Master of the Arts degree from Harvard University in 1863, followed by an honorary Legum Doctor from Shurtleff College in 1867. = Time at Illinois State University = Aware of his skill managing normal schools, the Illinois State Normal University in Bloomington, Illinois recruited Edwards in 1862. Edwards was elected chair of the mathematics department in May, then became president of the university that June. Edwards‚Äô presidency at Illinois State began the ‚ÄúBridgewater Era,‚Äù a span of three presidencies with men educated under the Bridgewater Normal methodology. Edwards led the university until he resigned in January 1876. Under his guidance, the number of students had increased from 285 to 780. Edwards‚Äô work on the curriculum of the university was a combination of elementary, secondary, and college-level education intended to hone the basic skills and knowledge of the teachers-in-training, turning the school into a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs university‚Äù as opposed to a ‚Äúgenuine normal school.\\" Edwards was outspoken in his beliefs in coeducation and women‚Äôs rights, especially during his time at ISNU. Edwards was an abolitionist who, as early as 1863, was advocating for the inclusion of African-American children in the normal school. He argued that the function of a public school was to educate everyone, and he would greatly protest if he was not allowed to when the decision to admit a young African-American girl to the model school arose in 1867.  Later Years  Edwards then became pastor of the Congregational Church of Princeton, Illinois; he had been ordained as a minister three years earlier. He resigned in 1884 to become financial agent for Knox College. In 1887, he was elected as a Republican as the Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction, serving for four years. He then accepted the presidency of Blackburn University, who bestowed an honorary Doctor of Divinity upon him the same year. He returned to Bloomington in 1893, occasionally working with Illinois Wesleyan University. He became a member of the Illinois Industrial League in 1858. In 1862, he joined the Illinois Natural History Society and the Illinois State Teachers' Association. He led the latter group as president in 1863 and 1864.

It crosses the Tsakona Valley and it spans a dangerous location near Megalopoli, where in the last decades, there have been many landslides.Tsakona Bridge Œ§4 Domi S.A.One of the World's Largest Arch Bridges Built in Greece, By Ioanna Zikakou, Aug 30, 2014, GreekReporter.comTsakona Bridge 2nd Largest in Greece to Open Shortly, By Toni Aravadinos, Dec 17, 2015, GreekReporter.com  Construction  The Tsakona Arch Bridge, with a length of 490 meters, was the last work that remained for the section Paradeisia ‚Äì Tsakona axis Tripolis ‚Äì Kalamata to be completed (made by the State and will be delivered to the consortium Moreas). As stated in the \\"Courage\\" by the project leader Nikos Donas, this bridge was one of the most difficult engineering projects, after the Charilaos Trikoupis Bridge. The project's cost was budgeted at ‚Ç¨94 million but there were significant cost overruns. This was due largely to the complexity of building in the very challenging and unstable geologic conditions at the site. The original studies made for construction of the bridge had also underestimated the challenges associated with construction, this also caused budget and time overruns. As a result, the total cost finished at ‚Ç¨131.5 million. The bridge is supported at three points: one at each end (abutments) and one that is closer to the top of the pier. This last is the most important: it is basically a giant 'prefab', which ensures the stability of the bridge. From the pier starts the arch of the bridge, with a maximum height of 30 meters. The two arches, one on each side, support the metal part of the bridge on which the road is located. Its construction started in 2008 and was opened for traffic in January 2016.

Early life Tribe grew up in Cambridge and received a BA in 1997 from Brown University where she studied art and semiotics. She received a fellowship from the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York in 1998 and completed an MFA at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2002. During 2005‚Äì6, she was awarded a fellowship at the American Academy in Berlin. In 2012, she received a USA fellowship. Works =There Will Be ________/Greystone, 2012= Tribe's 30-minute narrative short, Greystone, revisits one of the 20th century's most shocking and mysterious society murders. Filmed on location at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills California, in the very rooms where the killings took place, and using only dialog appropriated from dozens of Hollywood feature films that were also shot within the storied estate, Greystone proposes a series of explanations for how a Los Angeles oil tycoon and his personal assistant might actually have arrived at their deaths. =Critical Mass, 2012= Critical Mass is Kerry Tribe's tribute to Hollis Frampton's groundbreaking experimental film Critical Mass (1971). Hollis Frampton's original work captures an argument between a couple and cuts it up into a series of rhythmic, repetitive, fragmented phrases. For the Tate Museum in 2012 and the Museum of Modern Art in 2013, Tribe had actors Nick Huff and Emelie O'Hara reenact this classic structuralist film. =Milton Torres Sees a Ghost, 2010= In Tribe's installation, Milton Torres Sees a Ghost, magnetic audio-tape loops between two listening stations. Each listening station is equipped with a reel-to-reel audio player and an oscilloscope that displays a visual representation of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features the account of an American fighter pilot's encounter with a UFO over British air space in 1957, which was kept secret until the British government released records of the event in 2008. The testimony is edited so that, at times, the man seems to be describing the technology used to image the mysterious aircraft, whilst at other times he could be talking about technology present in the installation itself. As the tape moves around the space, it passes through two decks‚Äîone continuously lays the track down while the other erases it, therefore, providing visitors an intact soundtrack in one location and a fragmented version in another. The installation also includes censored and later declassified documents relating to the investigation of Milton Torres‚Äô sighting. =The Last Soviet, 2010= The Last Soviet (2010) is a looping 10-minute video that tells the story of Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who was stranded on the Mir space station for 311 days in 1991 during the collapse of the Soviet Union. Video footage of a model of the interior of Mir constructed in Tribe's studio is intercut with various archival materials related to this moment in history, including film footage of a performance of the ballet Swan Lake that was used to censor Russian news broadcasts of the political turmoil, images of tanks on the streets of Moscow, and photographs depicting aspects of the Russian space program. Throughout the image sequences, a male voiceover recounting the forgotten cosmonaut's story from a personal point of view in English with Russian subtitles alternates with a female voiceover giving a historical account of the period in Russian with English subtitles. =H.M., 2009= H.M. is a two-channel presentation of a single film looping through two projectors so that the right screen is shows a section of film 20 seconds after the left screen. The film is based on the true story of an anonymous, memory-impaired man, the famous amnesiac known in scientific literature only as \\"Patient H.M.\\" In 1953, when he was 27 years old, H.M. underwent experimental brain surgery intended to alleviate his epilepsy. The unintended result was a radical and persistent amnesia. Though he was no longer able to make lasting memories, his short-term recall, lasting about 20 seconds, remained intact.

It was built in 1866. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 July 2014.  History  Middenbury, a single-storeyed brick building, rectangular in plan and surrounded by verandahs on three sides, is located in Toowong on an elevated position on the Brisbane River. It was constructed in 1865 as a villa residence on land owned by Mrs Eliza Mary Rogers, who purchased the site of just over in that year. Until 1956, the place was used a residence, with large grounds surrounding the house. Following acquisition of the property in 1957 by the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) the site was used for radio and television broadcasting, with Middenbury used primarily for office space. Free settlement occurred in Brisbane, traditional country of the Yuggera and Turrbal people, from 1842. Land available for private ownership was progressively surveyed and offered for sale by the New South Wales Government (the separation of Queensland as an independent colony being in 1859) Land was categorized as either \\"town\\", within gazetted towns and villages, \\"suburban\\", within of town boundaries or \\"country\\", beyond this radius. Early settlement was largely focussed on town land on opposite sides of the river at North Brisbane and South Brisbane, while suburban areas, such as Toowong (then referred to as Milton or West Milton) developed more slowly. Moggill Road was surveyed and named in 1849 (later known as River Road, then partly Coronation Drive). It was the first route to Ipswich constructed on the north side of the Brisbane River and was shorter than the Ipswich Road on the other side of the river. The land on which Middenbury was constructed was located along this road. From the early 1850s, land speculators increasingly acquired property in the Milton and Toowong area, much of it initially for agricultural purposes.Gregory, Arcadian Simplicity, pp.26-27Allom, Lovell & Associates, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, pp.6-7. In July 1853 James Henderson, a manager of the Bank of Australasia in Sydney, purchased Portion 25, Parish of Enoggera, a parcel of over , dissected by the Moggill Road and fronting the Brisbane River. Henderson also purchased the adjacent Portion 26 and by 1860 had acquired around between what is now Toowong and Indooroopilly. In 1865 surveyor and land agent James Warner (on behalf of Henderson) began advertising land parcels for sale in the \\"Village of Nona\\", a subdivision plan of most of Portions 25 and 26. The remainder of Portion 25, a parcel of just over between Moggill Road and the river, was sold to Eliza Mary Rogers for ¬£100 an acre, with the Certificate of Title registered in April 1865.Andrew Darbyshire and Marilyn England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\" (pp.11-19), in Marilyn England (comp),Toowong 1863-2011, Toowong History Group, Brisbane, 2012 p.11, (pp.11-19)Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM), Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No:11058015. Born in 1797 at Rogate, in West Sussex, England, Eliza Mary Rogers (n√©e Gardner) arrived in Australia in 1835 with her husband Richard Rogers, their three children Eliza Mary, Louisa Emily, Lewis Gardner and three children from Richard's first marriage, Edward, Richard and Anna Susan. Another child Frank was born in 1837. Richard Rogers was employed as Ordnance Storekeeper in Sydney and for a time was also Colonial Storekeeper. In 1850 he was transferred to Hobart and performed similar duties until his retirement in 1855. The Rogers' returned to Sydney and in 1863, Richard accidentally drowned in a shallow creek in their garden at their Darling Point residence \\"Springfield\\".Darbyshire and England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\", p.12. Eliza Rogers' move from Sydney may have been influenced by her son Lewis Gardner (LG) living and working in Brisbane at this time. LG Rogers (b.1835) was appointed as a first class revenue clerk for the Queensland Treasury in 1862, a relatively high ranking and well paid position.Courier, 11 August 1862, p.2. It is uncertain when Eliza Rogers first came to Brisbane, but by February 1864 she was advertising for domestic servants in Milton.Courier, 15 February 1864, p.3. Following the separation of Queensland in 1859, the first half of the 1860s was a period of strong growth for Brisbane in the newly established colony of Queensland. Immigration boosted the population dramatically (more than doubling between 1861 and 1864 to over 12,000) and many substantial public and private buildings were constructed during this time. The urban environment of Brisbane's fledgling town centre, where residential dwellings co-existed in close proximity with commercial and industrial activity, was characterised by congestion, noise, and poor sanitation, common among other developing towns and cities in mid-19th century Australia.Gregory, Arcadian Simplicity, p.29Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.7. During this period \\"villa estates\\", located in the suburban periphery in then semi-rural settings - on elevated locations such as along ridgelines, and in some instances with river frontage - became an increasingly popular type of dwelling for Brisbane's more affluent residents. This demographic included higher-ranking public servants, professionals and successful business people. The flight to residential villa estates by the well-to-do was a development pattern that occurred internationally during the Victorian era. Key elements of villa estates included large and comfortable houses, associated outbuildings such as servant's' quarters and stabling, expansive garden settings, and a good road to town.Gregory, Arcadian Simplicity, pp.29-30Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.7Rod Fisher, \\"In Search of the Brisbane House\\" in Rod Fisher and Ray Sumner, eds, in Brisbane: Housing, Health, The River and The Arts, Brisbane History Group, 1985, p.43. While some early Brisbane suburban villa residences were located in relative isolation (such as St Johns Wood, in present-day Ashgrove), in other instances they were established in closer proximity, as occurred along the ridges and on the Brisbane River between Milton and Toowong. At the time of Eliza's Rogers' land purchase there were only a small number of residences in the area. Early substantial residences in the area included: Milton House , built for retired chemist Ambrose Eldridge ; \\"Minto\\", built for WLG Drew, Queensland's Auditor- General (1877-1889); \\"Dovercourt\\" (1864), the residence of architect William Ellerker; Moorland Villa (by 1862) for John Markwell, and Richard Langler Drew's \\"Karslake\\", later residence of early Toowong memoir writer John Bowden Fewings.See Gregory, Arcadian Simplicity, pp.26-45 and Marilyn England (comp),Toowong 1863-2011,and for early settlement and establishment of villa residences in Toowong/Milton area. Inhabitants. This early pattern of suburban settlement can be seen as both a geographic and built expression of the emerging socio-economic structure in Brisbane. In 1862 Richard Langler Drew bought and subdivided land on the outskirts of Brisbane, setting up a signboard: \\"This is the village of Toowong\\".The name \\"Toowong\\" is thought to derive from an Aboriginal word describing a bird, or the call of a bird, possibly the Koel or Cooee bird, a species of Cuckoo. Source: . However, closer suburban settlement did not occur in the area until the 1870s, spurred on by the arrival of the Main Line railway to Brisbane from Ipswich which passed through Toowong. By 1881 there 1275 people living in Toowong in 300 dwellings.Gregory, Arcadian Simplicity, p.39. In March 1865, the Brisbane Courier noted, \\"substantial brick villas, instead of wooden houses are on the increase\\".Brisbane Courier, 17 March 1865, p.2. A later article in September stated, \\"numerous villa residences have been erected during the past 12 months in the suburbs of the town...No greater proof of the prosperity of a city as a whole can be afforded than that derived from the disposition of its citizens to plant and build on its environs, and to make it their home socially as well as professionally...Scarcely a day passes but our advertising columns invite tenders for the erection of villa residences...\\".Brisbane Courier, 29 September 1865, p.2. The house was built for Eliza Mary Rogers and completed by December 1866.Tony Moore, \\"1860s home on ABC Toowong site heritage listed\\" , Brisbane Times, 21 July 2014.\\"Heritage listing for house on former ABC site\\" , Press release, Queensland Heritage Council, retrieved 3 September 2014. The design of Middenbury has been attributed to architect James Cowlishaw although there is no firm evidence of this.Donald Watson and Judith McKay, Queensland Architects of the 19th Century: A Biographical Dictionary, Queensland Museum, Brisbane, 1994, p.44. Cowlishaw advertised tenders for the erection of a cottage of brick at Milton in the Brisbane Courier 17 May 1865, p.1. An October newspaper advertisement for villa sites on the Nona Estate noted their location next to the residence '\\"recently erected for L.G. Rogers, Esq.\\"'Brisbane Courier, 30 October 1865, p.5. indicating Middenbury was constructed at this time. A 1984 conservation management plan describes Middenbury when it was completed:Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.10. > \\"Middenbury...followed the detached villa pattern.

By June 1866, the house was known as \\"Middenbury\\".Brisbane Courier, 27 June 1866, p.1. The source of the name has not been verified; one suggested link is the suburb of Midanbury, in Southampton, England, which took its name from a large house Middenbury, built in the 1700s.Darbyshire and England, Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built , pp.12-13. Both Lewis and Eliza Rogers' name appear in notices related to Middenbury from the time of its completion, and the house appears to have been used as residence by both members of the family. Middenbury was let out for a few months in both 1868 and 1869; at this time it was identified as the house of Eliza Rogers.Brisbane Courier, 20 October 1866, p.329 December 1866, p.17 November 1868, p.13 November 1869 p 1. In 1874, of the Middenbury property was acquired by the Commissioner of Railways for the railway extension to Brisbane from Ipswich.DNRM, Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No: CT10058015, ;CT10227147Darbyshire and England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\", pp.12. An 1875 survey map conducted as part of this process shows Middenbury with verandahs on its northeast and southeast elevations, with the rear of the house flanked by service wings, and a building on the site of the stables.Reproduced in Darbyshire and England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\", p.10. After Rogers' death in 1875, the house was owned by her children and rented to a series of well-to-do tenants; in 1885 her son Frank subdivided the original and retained the house and a little over . In 1891 it was bought by Tim O‚ÄôShea, a Brisbane merchant. His family owned the house until 1949; in 1920 they hosted the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII. They made various additions to the house, including an extension containing a bathroom and a study or additional bedroom, and a garage building with a room for a chauffeur, laid out a circular driveway, and created a tennis court in the garden. After the death of Eliza Rogers at Middenbury in October 1875, the property passed to four of the Rogers siblings - Eliza (Jr), Louisa (Minnie), Lewis and Frank. Lewis Rogers died at Middenbury in December 1876, with his share in the property passing to his wife Frances Wyndowe Rogers (n√©e Miles) whom he had married in 1867.DNRM, Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No: 10233219Brisbane Courier, 30 July 1867, p.2. In March 1877, Frank Rogers was advertising Middenbury for rental, \\"containing drawing, dining, 7 bedrooms, besides kitchen, laundry...coachhouse, stables, garden, and paddock, and every requisite for a gentleman's family\\".Brisbane Courier, 17 March 1877, p.1. In the same month, much of the contents of Middenbury were put up for auction. The exhaustive list compiled for the auction reveals the affluent lifestyle of the Rogers' during their residency. In addition to the \\"superior household furniture\\", \\"culinary requisites\\" and items used by domestic staff, the family horse and carriage, milch cows, pigs and poultry were also offered for purchase.Brisbane Courier, 24 March 1877, p.8. A number of tenants are known to have occupied Middenbury from 1877 until its purchase by Timothy O'Shea in 1891. Thomas Finney, co-founder of the large Queensland retail firm of Finney, Isles and Co., lived with his family at Middenbury until mid-1883, while his family's new residence, Sidney House (designed by FDG Stanley) was erected on the adjacent property.Brisbane Courier, 10 August 1883, p.1 According to Florence Lord, in her 1930s series on Brisbane's Historic Homes, \\"Mr Jackson\\" brother-in-law of Thomas Finney, resided in Middenbury prior to the Finney's. Hervey Murray-Prior, a barrister and Master of Titles (and son of Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior, Queensland's first postmaster-general), was living at Middenbury with his family in 1885. However, by September of that year, the contents of the house were advertised for auction, suggesting an end to their tenancy around this time.Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.10Brisbane Courier, 10 September 1885, p.7Darbyshire and England, Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built , p.13. Henry Bolton, a former Member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria who became managing director of the Queensland Brewing Company in 1883, was living at Middenbury in mid-1889 when it was offered to let.Parliament of Victoria, Re-Member (Former members), Henry Bolton, accessed online, 30 April 2014, Brisbane Courier 15 June 1889, p.2Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald and General Advertiser, 27 November 1883.Original brick stables at Middenbury, 1932 In April 1885 Middenbury, described as \\"a commodious country residence...command[ing] views of reaches both up and down the stream, and overlooking the whole of Brisbane, north and south\\" was put up for auction,Brisbane Courier, 26 March 1885, p.6. but was not sold. By July of that year Frank Rogers had bought out the three other shares held by his two sisters and Francis Rogers, and is believed to have occupied the house periodically in the late 1880s.Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.11DNRM, Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No: 10233219. Frank Rogers subdivided the property and sold off parcels to the south of the house, ultimately retaining the residence on just over .DNRM, Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No:10559058 Present day Archer Street was formed from this subdivision (officially named in 1887) and an entrance to Middenbury was made off this street.Brisbane Courier, 15 September 1887, p.6Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.12. In August 1890 Timothy O'Shea, a retired successful Brisbane produce merchant, signed a one-year lease over Middenbury for ¬£17 a month, before buying the property in August 1891.DNRM, Queensland Government, Certificate of Title No: 10817098. Middenbury remained the family residence of the O'Shea's until 1949. Timothy and Ellen O'Shea emigrated from Killarney, Ireland to Queensland in 1863.1863 date from Timothy O'Shea's obituary, Brisbane Courier 6 September 1922, p.5. Pat O'Shea's obituary in Sunday Mail, 6 February 1949, p.3, gives the date as 1859. Of their five children who were raised in Brisbane, Timothy (Ted), Patrick (Pat or PJ) and only daughter Ella are known to have resided at Middenbury. After her mother's death in 1873, Ella assisted her father in raising the family and running the household, continuing this role after her father died. Patrick, Ted and other brother John, (Jack or JJ) were all solicitors, while another brother Michael James was a doctor. Patrick and Ted established the firm O'Shea and O'Shea (later O'Shea, Corser and Wadley) solicitors in 1891. Apart from his legal practice, Pat was involved in a range of business activities. Along with his brother Ted, he was part of the original syndicate which became the City Electric Light Company, and also maintained interests in the Queensland Brewery, Moreton Sugar Mill, furniture company John Hicks, and suburban property subdivision. An owner and breeder of horses, he was closely involved in the racing industry, a one-time president (for 22 years) and life member of the Queensland Turf Club. The PJ O'Shea Stakes, Queensland's major weight for age staying race, is named in his honour.Brisbane Courier, 23 November 1872, p.4Brisbane Courier 6 September 1922, p.5Courier-Mail, 3 February 1949, p.6Sunday Mail, 6 February 1949, p.3Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, pp.11-13Darbyshire and England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\", pp.14-17. Middenbury, 1932 During the O'Shea's time at Middenbury, the longest period of continuous occupancy of the building as a residence, considerable alterations and additions occurred at the property. The largest change to the house was the addition of a brick building containing a study/bedroom and bathroom, connected to the house verandah by an open sided \\"piazza\\" which featured built-in wall beds. A garage and chauffeur's room were added along Archer Street, near the earlier brick stables which also housed a room for guests. While the extent of alterations to the grounds during the O'Shea period is unclear, it is known a lawn tennis court was established on a terraced area between the river and the house, while other landscape features included a large circular driveway, mature trees and a series of garden beds.Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, pp.11-13, 68-70. Australian Governor-General Lord Gowrie (right) and Lady Gowrie (centre) at the races, September 1937 Timothy O'Shea died age 91 at Middenbury in 1922. Ella, Pat and Ted (d.1930) never married and lived out their days at Middenbury in comfortable circumstances. Prior to World War II, Middenbury became a well-known social venue for the elite in Brisbane, with the house and the grounds hosting numerous events and guests. The social pages of Brisbane's newspapers regularly reported on occasions held at the residence including events connected to racing and regatta parties. In 1936 Ella was featured as part of The Courier-Mail's \\"Brisbane Hostesses in the Home\\" series. Pictured in the drawing room of Middenbury, the article claimed, \\"Musicians, actors, travellers...who have been guests...have spread the fame of Miss Ella O'Shea as a hostess in all the English speaking countries\\".Queensland Figaro, 11 October 1930, p.10Courier-Mail, 10 August 1936, p.18 Ella O'Shea died on 2 February 1949, age 92. Three days later, on 5 February, Pat, who was reported as saying to his close friends, \\"If I live only five minutes after my sister, I shall die happy\\" also died,Sunday Mail, 6 February 1949, p.3. both leaving substantial estates. Pat's obituary in the Sunday Mail noted the end of an era at the now empty Middenbury, where, \\"Titled people, actors, artists, world celebrities were invited...They found its halls a home and its gardens a soft sanctuary\\". After the deaths of the last members of the O'Shea family, Middenbury was put up for by auction on 6 July 1949. William Ramsay Webster and Amy Louisa Webster, of Webster's Cake and Biscuit Company, and the original Shingle Inn, purchased the property for just over ¬£11,000.Courier-Mail, 7 July 1949, p.4Darbyshire and England, \\"Eliza Mary Rogers: Middenbury built \\", pp.17-18. Prior to the sale, an auction notice described Middenbury at this time:Courier-Mail, 25 June 1949, p.11. > \\"Middenbury is substantially built of brick and wood, with slate and > galvanised iron roofs, and comprises spacious verandahs, vestibule, halls, > card room, lounge, music room, three bedrooms, two well appointed bathrooms > with marble surrounds and shower room, with tiled floors, lounge verandah > with set-in folding American beds, study, dining room with wine cellar, > scullery, kitchen, with tiled fireplace...Maid's Rooms, brick chimneys with > marble mantelpieces... built-in cupboards throughout, polished floors and > sewered; Boiler room...laundry equipped with bricked-in copper and porcelain > wash tubs, wood rooms, double garage with concreted wash yard, man's room > and storerooms; Stable Building, with attic and comfortable bedroom; and 2 > sets of brick lavatories\\". The Webster family continued the O'Shea tradition of hosting large social gatherings at Middenbury, and lived there until 1955, when it was sold to Accommodation Australia Ltd after which it was used as a boarding house.Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, p.13 In 1957 the Commonwealth of Australia bought it and the Sidney House next door for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1957 Middenbury and the adjacent property containing Sidney House were purchased and combined (identified in 2014 as Lot 13, RP104400) by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, (ABC, now known as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation) to establish new adjoining Queensland facilities for radio and television production and broadcasting. Operated by the Australian Government, ABC television commenced radio broadcasting in Australia on 1 July 1932. The Queensland government-owned radio station 4QG was taken over by the ABC and broadcast in the mornings and evenings, before a second station 4QR was opened in 1938 to broadcast the full national program. The ABC was given responsibility to provide national television programs in 1954, commencing in November 1956, in time for the Olympic Games in Melbourne. The focus of ABC's television operations was initially in Melbourne and Sydney until the late 1950s, when services were established in Sydney, Adelaide and Hobart.NBRS and Partners, Addenda to Application Form, Nomination of Middenbury for Entry to the Queensland Heritage Register, 2009, pp.15-18 Sidney House was demolished to make way for the first major building on the site, the television studios. Constructed in brick, it was a three-storey building mounted by a steel-framed tower for beaming programmes to the main transmitting tower at nearby Mount Coot-tha. The building included an isolated studio, plus projection, sound, viewing control, and news section rooms. In 1968 the television studio building was extended towards the river. The other major building constructed on the site was the 1964 brick radio studio, located between Archer Street and Middenbury, which included special acoustic studios.Courier-Mail, 7 October 1958, p.7National Archives Files: AC148 PART 2 Brisbane ABC TV Studios - Toowong, AC148 PART 3, Brisbane ABC TV Studios - Toowong, AC148/1 PART 1 toowong ABC - Erection TV Studios;NBRS and Partners, Addenda to Application Form, Nomination of Middenbury for Entry to the Queensland Heritage Register, 2009, pp.15-18. The ABC's first television broadcast in Queensland occurred on 2 November 1959 at 7PM. In a nod to its past, Middenbury hosted some 300 invited guests at the official function to mark the occasion, with 10 televisions set up within the building for viewing of the live broadcast of the ABC's \\"Queensland Television Service\\". \\"Channel 2\\" was Brisbane's third television station and Australia's twelfth.Courier- Mail, 2 November 1959, p.133 November 1959, p.1. However, the ABC primarily used Middenbury as offices and a canteen. Middenbury, surrounded by a steep retaining wall, 2009 The ABC built several buildings on the site and the original wooden service wing at the rear, the extension, and the outbuildings including the garage were demolished and almost all the gardens destroyed; the house was almost surrounded by a steep retaining wall. As with Sidney House, the ABC had not originally intended to retain Middenbury, with its location designated for radio broadcasting facilities. By the early 1960s, earlier outbuildings, including the stables, garage and most of the garden features had been removed. On Coronation Drive, two large weeping figs near the former entrance were retained. As part of the major landscaping of the site, much of Middenbury became surrounded by a steep concrete retaining wall. At the house, the \\"piazza\\" and bedroom extension and the rear timber wing on the southwest were demolished.Federal Department of Works, Report on Middenbury, Toowong, Brisbane, 1969, p.4National Archives File: QA1963/674M/2 Toowong ABC site Radio and TV StudiosAllom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan, pp.70-74. In 1969, a report prepared by the Federal Department of Works on Middenbury identified the historical significance of the building and recommended preserving the house \\"if at all possible\\". The report noted part of the building was used for canteen facilities, \\"which could be extended to become a most attractive staff amenity\\" or alternatively \\"an excellent executive office suite\\".Federal Department of Works, Report on Middenbury, Toowong, Brisbane p.4. Repairs had also been undertaken and the interior \\"extensively decorated\\". Over time, Middenbury was used mainly as office space while part of the ABC's operations. The building underwent additions and alterations internally, including partitioning in some spaces to create new rooms.see Allom Lovell & Associates Pty Ltd, Middenbury: An Historical Survey and Management Plan for more detailed description of changes over time and analysis of the fabric of the house (up to 1984). While elements disappeared, Middenbury retained its essential 1865 building form, some early internal spaces and cedar joinery, while maintaining its orientation and relationship to the river. In its last few years of occupancy by the ABC, Middenbury housed the Chief Executive, Finance and Human Resources operations.Pers. comms., Gary Crane, HR Business Partner, Queensland ABC, 14 April 2014 The ABC used the house and of land until 2006-2007, when they vacated it after a high incidence of breast cancer was found among female employees raising concerns the site had radioactive contamination, although the site was subsequently declared to have no radioactivity in 2010. As the ABC's key site for broadcasting and production in Queensland for nearly half a century, the Toowong facilities were highly important, broadcasting news, current affairs and numerous other television and radio programs throughout Queensland and other parts of Australia. Between 1957 and 2007, the ABC's facilities were frequently altered, with the addition of other buildings on the site, and internal changes to earlier buildings. With the vacating of the site, much of the broadcasting equipment and associated fittings and fixtures were dismantled or removed, effectively inhibiting the site's ability to demonstrate its former function.NBRS and Partners, Addenda to Application Form, Nomination of Middenbury for Entry to the Queensland Heritage Register, 2009, pp.15-29. In 2012, the ABC Brisbane office moved into new studios at the South Bank Parklands.  Description  Middenbury is a low-set, single-storey, brick former residence with a slate roof with rear timber wings and additions, located on a sloping property beside the Brisbane River in the Brisbane suburb of Toowong. The house is oriented to take advantage of the views and has timber verandahs on three sides. The interior includes fine cedarwood joinery, including folding doors enabling the large main room to be divided into two. It stands on the highest point of land in the western corner of an approximately site bounded by Coronation Drive to the north-west, Archer Street and a residential property to the south-west, the Brisbane River to the south-east, and residential properties to the north-east. Despite the construction of a number of later buildings on the site and extensive alterations to the surrounding terrain, views from Middenbury to the Brisbane River and the CBD have been maintained, while two large fig trees along the Coronation Drive boundary mark of the location of the original entrance drive. In 2014, access to Middenbury and other buildings on site is via modern driveways cut into the original slope of the property, one each from Archer Street and Coronation Drive, which meet in the centre of the site. High, sloping concrete retaining walls line the edge of these driveways, effectively cutting off the platform of land on which Middenbury stands from the rest of the site. To the west of these driveways is a car park and loading area. The north-eastern portion of the site is largely covered by buildings. Built in close proximity to Middenbury on the north, east and southern sides are two double-storey buildings, which are connected to Middenbury's verandahs by paths and covered walkways. Middenbury consists of a rectangular brick core with verandahs to three sides and a hipped roof. It is oriented with its long axis running north-west to south-east, with the south-east elevation facing the Brisbane River. The main entrance is located on the north-east side and a timber wing and other timber additions are attached to the rear (north-west) side. The roof of the core is clad in slate with lead ridge capping and has boxed eaves ornamented with paired and tripled timber console brackets. Two rendered brick chimney stacks, one double and one single, capped by chimney pots, are symmetrically arranged on either side of the central ridgeline. The concave, timber-framed verandah roofs are clad in corrugated metal sheeting. Verandah beams have stop-chamfered edges in places. The slender, cylindrical timber verandah posts with square base and top are modern replicas of the original posts, which were more finely detailed. Paired columns are located at the main entrance. The timber verandah decking is supported on rendered brick piers with metal ant caps. The walls of the core are load-bearing red-brown brick laid in English bond. Above verandah roof height, the external walls are rendered, ornamented with a narrow ovolo moulding supporting the timber eaves brackets to the main roof. The main entrance has a low-waisted, four panel cedar door with fanlight and half- glazed side panels. Timber-framed French doors with arched lights and rectangular fanlights open on to the three verandahs. One French door on the south-west side has rectangular glazed panels instead of arched. Fanlights are centre-pivoting and French doors are mounted on steel parliament hinges. Two former doorways in the south-west corner of the house have been filled with orange bricks. The core contains seven rooms laid out on either side of an L-shaped corridor, which runs from a vestibule at the main entrance to a central hall before turning north-west to the rear of the house. The principal reception rooms overlook the river on the south-east side of the building, divided by a modern partition wall. Other rooms, including former bedrooms and a small room off the central hall, are different sizes and have had some walls relocated. One large room on the southern side of the corridor has different finishes to the rest of the house, being s in style. A small bathroom and store room are located in the south-west corner of the core. Early finishes and features include plaster ceilings and cornices, wide cedar skirtings (stained dark brown) and timber picture rails. In 2014, most internal walls are covered by at least one layer of wallpaper which has subsequently been painted over, and the timber floors are covered in carpet. Three former fireplaces have been enclosed. Typical doors are low-waisted, cedar, four panel leaves set in moulded cedar frames with rectangular, centre-pivoting fanlights with a central vertical glazing bar. Surviving early door hardware includes brass, ceramic and timber knobs and keyhole covers. Some doors may have been relocated from their original positions. In the entrance vestibule, a moulded plaster archway, with capitals and keystone, ornaments the opening to the central hall. The main reception room has a large rectangular doorway opening with holes in the timber lintel surviving as evidence of previous folding timber doors. This room also has a partially glazed six-panel timber door. The central hall has a curved corner at the intersection with the rear hallway. The small room off the central hall has built-in timber bookcases on either side of the former fireplace. The s room features a decorative plaster ceiling and cornices, a different profile of timber skirting, and different door architraves. The door to the hallway has a single-light fanlight with dimpled glass. In the western corner of the room is a small built-in cupboard with a linoleum clad floor. The timber structures at the rear of the core consist of an L-shaped wing, remnants of rear verandahs (now enclosed) and 1960s additions. The L-shaped wing has round timber stumps, external walls clad in timber chamferboards and a hipped roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. Beneath the building, vertical timber batten screens run between the perimeter stumps, and a timber door on the north-west side provides access to the underfloor area. Windows on the north-east and north-west walls are timber, double-hung sashes. Entrance to this wing is via a half-glazed, four- panel timber door opening onto the north-east verandah, and through internal doors linking it to the other rear extensions. The interior is divided into a large room at the eastern end and a smaller room at the western end. In 2014 the walls and ceilings are lined with painted hardboard or plasterboard, stained timber skirtings and architraves, and the timber floor is lined with modern carpet. Middenbury from West End looking across the Brisbane River, 2009 A long rectangular room located along the rear of the core, fitted out as a kitchen in 2014, is in the location of an earlier room or verandah space and may contain early structural fabric. This room has a raked ceiling with a boxed-in beam spanning its length, painted hardboard wall and ceiling linings, and modern carpet over a timber floor. Some early fabric from a previous verandah may also survive in a small hallway area along the southern edge of the L-shaped wing. Middenbury stands upon a remnant platform of land at original ground height, with lawns and recent garden beds to the north and east sides of the house. In this elevated location, Middenbury retains its original views to the Brisbane River and the Brisbane CBD, as well as being visible from the river and from the opposite bank at West End. Two significant, mature fig trees (possibly Ficus benjamina) are located north- west of Middenbury along the Coronation Drive boundary. These large trees, overhanging the road, are a landmark feature along Coronation Drive.  Heritage listing  In 1968, Middenbury was one of the earliest listings on the Register of the National Trust of Queensland. It was also listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register and was included in the Register of the National Estate in 1978. When the Queensland Heritage Act 1992 commenced, Middenbury had been included in the newly established Queensland Heritage Register. However, in 2004 reference to it having been entered in the state register was removed by a decision of the Queensland Heritage Council, in acceptance of legal advice regarding properties owned by the Australian Government for public purposes. When the ABC sold the Toowong site to Sunland Group in 2013, a condition of the sale was that an application be made to place the house on the Queensland Heritage Register. Sunland plans a high-rise residential development called Grace on Coronation; the house is to be preserved in a park setting and possibly used as a gallery or cafe.Tony Moore, \\"Champagne flute towers proposed for Toowong ABC site\\" , Brisbane Times, 1 September 2014. As at 2018, some site clearing has occurred but no construction has commenced. Middenbury House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 July 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Middenbury, erected in 1865, is important in demonstrating the evolution of residential housing and pattern of settlement in Queensland, in particular the early establishment of villa residences on the suburban periphery of Brisbane in the 1860s. Through its form, materials, location and setting on the Brisbane River, Middenbury makes an important contribution to our understanding of residential and social hierarchies in early Brisbane. Middenbury is also important for its association with Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), as a component of its Queensland television and radio production facilities from 1957‚Äì2007. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Middenbury is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an 1860s villa residence in Queensland, through its surviving formal plan, consisting of an entrance vestibule, large reception rooms, generously sized bedrooms, rear timber service wing; and the high quality workmanship and materials used in its construction, including fine cedar joinery. Consciously sited in an elevated location, the brick core with slate roof is surrounded on three sides by timber verandahs accessed by French doors, providing a generous space for entertaining and enjoying the views to the Brisbane River and CBD. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Middenbury is important for its aesthetic value as an elegant and well-composed villa residence designed to take advantage of its elevated position on the bank of the Brisbane River. Encircled by verandahs on three sides and orientated to capture surrounding views, the house demonstrates picturesque qualities, standing out from its surroundings when viewed from the river and the opposite bank at West End. Two large fig trees, the only surviving elements of Middenbury's former gardens, are a landmark feature along Coronation Drive and make a significant contribution to the streetscape.

His father is former Roscommon star John 'Jigger' O'Connor, famed for scoring a goal past Kerry's Charlie Nelligan 35 seconds into the 1980 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. O'Connor didn't play inter-county at Under-16 or Under-17 level, but Stephen Friel called him up for the minors in 2013. After leading Buncrana to glory in the 2013 Donegal Minor Championship, Jim McGuinness called him up to the senior inter-county squad for winter training in September 2013. He scored a point on his senior championship debut as a late replacement against Derry in the 2014 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final on 25 May 2014, ahead of his Leaving Certificate. Then, again as a late replacement, he scored a wonder goal for Donegal in the semi-final against Antrim. McGuinness said afterwards: ‚ÄúI was hoping for a point and then he turns back onto his right foot and hit a goal. It was a bit of class and he does have that wee trick up his sleeve which is nice in a forward. And I think he was well goosed by the time we took him off.

After her cancer diagnosis in 2002, Moorjani was taken to a hospital in 2006 where she lay in a coma for 30 hours, during which Moorjani claims to have undergone a Near Death Experience (NDE). Biography =Early life and education= Moorjani was born to Indian parents Hargobind (father) and Neelu (mother) Shamdasani in Singapore. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to Sri Lanka, and then at age two, moved to Hong Kong, where she and her older brother Anoop grew up. Moorjani and her brother both studied in British schools. As an ethnic minority in a majority British school, Moorjani says she was often the victim of bullying. Moorjani's parents are Indian, and because of her diverse cultural background, grew up multilingual, speaking Sindhi, Cantonese, and English simultaneously. =Near Death Experience (NDE)= In February 2002, while living and working in Hong Kong, Moorjani was diagnosed with lymphoma after finding a lump on her neck. Initially, Moorjani rejected conventional medicine. She had watched several people close to her die of cancer, including her brother-in-law and her best friend, despite extensive conventional treatments. Over the months that ensued, Moorjani experimented with various alternative healing practices, but to no avail. She subsequently underwent several conventional cancer treatments. However, by that point, despite these treatments, her doctors informed her and her family that it was \\"too late\\" to save her life. The lymphoma had spread throughout her body and had metastasized. Moorjani came out of the coma 30 hours later. During those 30 hours, Moorjani asserts that she experienced many characteristic details of a near death experience. Her account includes an out-of-body experience with observations and awareness of physical surroundings. Moorjani said she had a strong reluctance to return to her suffering and dying physical body, but was encouraged to return by her father and best friend who told her that she needed to return and to \\"live her life fearlessly.\\" ‚ÄúDying to Be Me‚Äù, 76. Subsequent to coming out of her coma, Moorjani‚Äôs tumors shrank by about 70% within four days, and within five weeks, she was cancer-free and released from the hospital, although she had to spend a few months in physiotherapy to regain her strength and the use of all her muscles and limbs.Meryl Davids Landau, ‚ÄúFrom Near-Death to Cancer-Free: An Amazing True Story,‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôCare2,‚Äô‚Äô November 1, 2012. =Professional life= She submitted the description of her NDE and subsequent healing to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) website, a site owned and run by oncologist Jeffrey Long and his wife, Jody Long, a family law attorney. Her story came to the attention of American self-help author, Wayne Dyer, who contacted his publishers, Hay House, asking them to locate Moorjani and suggest that she write a book, which they would publish. Dying to be Me was published in March 2012, and hit The New York Times bestsellers list two weeks after its release. Moorjani was then invited to be on Wayne Dyer's PBS special titled \\"Wishes Fulfilled\\", and since then, has been interviewed on \\"Fox And Friends,\\" CNN's \\"Anderson Cooper 360,\\" National Geographic International, Karen Davila's Headstart on ANC Philippines, among many others. Dying to be Me has subsequently sold over a million copies worldwide, and has been published in more than 40 languages. On 15 April 2015, Deadline reported that the New York Times best selling book Dying To Be Me has been optioned to producer Ridley Scott's company Ridley Scott Films. In January 2016, Moorjani's case attracted the attention of Dr. Oz, who scrutinized her medical records, and subsequently invited her to be on his show. Skeptics criticize the message that Anita speaks. Vicky Allen, journalist at The Herald Scotland, states \\"These people are at the centre of a disturbing approach to illness, and cancer in particular, that sees it as a disease to be tackled with the mind and positive thinking. It is a movement which many within the medical establishment believe is dangerous.\\" Peter Allmark of Sheffield Hallam University, co-author of a 2011 paper, A Critique Of Positive Thinking In Cancer Care, denounces the approach as \\"quackery\\". Medical explanation of recovery from cancer Oncologist haematologist T.K. Chan, who treated Moorjani at the critical stage of her illness, ascribed her recovery to the draining of her lungs carried out by medical specialists after she was admitted to hospital, followed by chemotherapy which she had refused for three and a half years. Chan stated \\"with lymphoma, it's never too late\\" and \\"Hodgkin's disease is quite curable .. it can have a dramatic response to chemotherapy\\". Personal life Moorjani met her husband, Danny Moorjani, in Hong Kong, and they married in December 1995. Moorjani lives with her husband in the United States.JO,After Death and Finding Your Purpose?

The book was published by HarperCollins on August 26, 2014. Plot The Revenge of Seven picks up exactly where The Fall of Five left off. The book is narrated in first person, with Number Four (John), Number Six, and Ella as narrators. Ella wakes up in a strange place, she sees Mogadorians and tries to escape using the Great Book as a weapon. She realizes that she is in a spaceship. Setr√°kus Ra claims to be her grandfather. He tries to force her to eat and tells her that he used to be an Elder and that he experimented with altering genetics. He also tells her about how Lorien was controlling everything, and he rivaled it. Then, he puts a binding charm over himself and Ella. The Mogadorians try to force Ella to read the Great Book by blasting an alarm at her whenever she doesn't. Ella rips the book apart. Setr√°kus Ra talks to her, mentioning her \\"betrothed\\". Eventually he arrives. Ella is disgusted to note that she is betrothed to the treacherous Number Five. She finds out that Five killed Eight, and is even more upset. Setr√°kus Ra trains Ella to use her Legacy Dreynen, using Five as the equivalent of a punching bag. She apologizes to him later telepathically. He responds that he deserved it and that they need to escape. Ella wakes up later to find Five talking about how Mogadorians were bad. She finds out that Five was not aware of their betrothal either. Setr√°kus Ra catches them. Five stabs Setr√°kus Ra and the binding charm makes Ella injured as well. She loses consciousness. John, Sam, Sarah, Malcolm, and Adam, as well as a bunch of Chim√¶ra are staying in an abandoned textile factory. They figure out that the surviving Garde are in Florida, except for one who's dot on the tablet is bouncing everywhere. Adam suggests going to Ashwood Estates instead of predictably going to Florida. The others agree, John with a bit of persuasion required. They find a website titled They Walk Among Us with information about the Mogadorians, and Sarah goes to meet Mark James. Malcolm, John, Sam, and most of the Chim√¶ra go to Ashwood Estates. The Chim√¶ra carry cameras. They survey Mogs carrying equipment, and kill them. Adam admits that the General residing at the Estates is his father. John attacks him, and his shield bracelet is broken. The Chim√¶ra also attack. The General grabs John's neck and squeezes hard. Adam stabs his father through the back. They observe the decomposition of the General's augmented parts. Adam takes up his father's old sword. They stay at the Estates. Adam uses Mogadorian surveillance to see Seven (Marina), Six, and Nine break into the base. Adam hacks a ship and uses its guns to kill all of the Mogadorians. Six, Marina, and Nine are trying to escape the swamp. They find a town, and see that the Chicago penthouse was destroyed. Marina finds Dale, who claims that there is an old NASA base in the swamp with UFOs flying around it. She believes that Eight's body is there and decides to have Dale lead them there. Nine and Six agree. Marina tells Six that she can feel Eight somewhere. They see Mogadorians from their boat and kill them. Dale is frightened and flees the boat. Seven and Six find a huge Mogadorian base. They turn invisible and enter it. Nine uses his animal telepathy to tell a beast controlled by the Mogadorians to cause a distraction. It obliges but is killed. They make it into a greenhouse. They find Number Five lurking, as well as Number Eight's body. Five stabs a Mogadorian telling him to bring Eight's body to a ship. Six, Seven, and Nine are left with Eight's body. Nine apologizes out loud. Marina says that she forgives him and they hug. A huge Mogadorian ship appears in the doorway and kills all of the Mogadorians. They hear Number Four's voice coming out of the ship and board it. Six \\"pilots\\" it to Ashwood Estates, with Adam's instruction. Six and Sam kiss at their return. Shortly after Seven, Six, and Nine come to Ashwood Estates, Agent Walker and the FBI arrive. They have realized that the Mogadorians are villainous and want to help the Garde. They have seen what happens when someone stops taking the Mogadorian augmentations and they tell the Garde about the plan of the Mogadorians. Their plan is to assassinate the secretary of defense, Bud Sanderson, who was working for the Mogadorians. They believe that his assassination will help stop Setr√°kus Ra's invasion plan. The next day, Malcolm gathers footage of his mind being dredged. He shows them what he said, that Lorien is not a planet, but an entity, and that it can be awoken in Earth when their Inheritances are put in Calakmul. Four, Sam, and Nine decide to proceed with Walker's plan and go to New York. Marina, Six, and Adam decide to go to Calakmul. They collect much of the Inheritances to \\"commit to the earth\\" and also bring Henri's ashes and Eight's body. On the plane, Marina is hostile toward Adam. She then finds out that he killed his Mogadorian father, and stops. They find a Mogadorian ship trying to contact them. Adam acts authoritative and their ship is allowed entry. When they leave the ship, Phiri Dun-Ra pretends to bargain with him, but hits him on the head. Six and Seven kill the Mogadorians, except for Phiri Dun-Ra. Six, Seven, and Adam pass through a force field and climb. They open a door with three pendants and are transported to a place with Loralite everywhere. They see a cylinder in the ground that looks like a well. They dump the contents of the chests, their pendants, and Henri's ashes down it. Eight's body reanimates. But it isn't him: it's Lorien speaking. It speaks cryptically and annoys Six, but it temporarily resurrects Eight. Eight kisses Marina one last time before disappearing again. But they find out that the Lorien entity is spreading. Sam, Four, and Walker are driving. On the way, Nine tries to interrogate Sam about Six. Four stops him. Nine claps, wearing a pair of gloves from Marina's chest, and generates a huge noise. The Mogadorians, of course, find them and attack. The heroes are trying to get bystanders to flee. One bystander takes a video of Four using his healing power. They enter the hotel where Sanderson is staying, and see Sanderson. He looks awful and has clearly been taking Mogadorian augmentations. He says that it is too late and then shoots himself in the head. Four somehow stops the bullet with telekinesis and heals him. Sanderson tells them that it is too late to prevent the invasion. A spaceship comes. Sanderson gives Walker names of politicians working for the Mogadorians. They arrive at Setr√°kus Ra's planned invasion site. Nine breaks Setr√°kus Ra's staff, and Ra reverts from his human form to the repulsive genetically modified Mogadorian one. Ra uses Dreynen when Number Four attacks. He would have killed Ella, but Four prevented it. Five stops Four from stabbing Setr√°kus Ra and killing Ella. Four and Five fight, but Five tells Four about the charm on Ella. Four prevents a wave of bullets from hitting Ra and Ra drags Ella back onto his ship. The warship starts to fire. Sam and Four are separated from everyone else except for a group of human survivors. A Piken was after them. It was knocked down with telekinetic force. The implication is that Sam did it.

It is situated near the mouth of the Cadoxton River which flows into the Bristol Channel at the Bendricks to the south-east of Barry Docks. It is accessed via the Associated British Port-owned Wimbourne Road from Ffordd-y-Mileniwm near Weston Square, Cadoxton or from the public Hayes Road from the Main B4267 Sully Moors Road, south-west of the village of Sully. It is sometimes considered to be in Sully. It covers an area of .Atlantic Trading Estate Particulars, Vale of Glamorgan Council It covers an area of . Archaeological excavation at the estate determined it had been used as a \\"prehistoric settlement and early Christian burial site\\". There was evidence of a Bronze Age settlement, as well as small, unenclosed inhumation cemeteries dating from the late-Roman through post-Roman periods. History The estate was a Supply Reserve Depot prior to becoming a trading estate. In 1971, the Official Report of the Standing Committees delivered to Parliament referred to \\"a new project called the Atlantic Trading Estate, on the seaboard near Barry\\", stating that \\"there are a considerable number of new undertakings, and it is creating a significant, though relatively small, amount of employment\\". In November 2001, APC Panels sought permission to build a new factory and office development at the Atlantic Trading Estate. The estate, in a deprived area of the town, has long been the target of arson and vandalism. In April 2006, a fire broke out in the Arcade Buildings, a block of industrial units on the Atlantic Trading Estate. In February 2007, car was set on fire, and in September, a lorry trailer containing rubbish and tyres was set ablaze in a suspected arson attack. In mid April 2008, a major fire broke out on the estate, affecting a derelict industrial unit housing, a warehouse and several garages. Several months later two men were arrested on the estate, suspected of dismantling metal girders and guilty of arson. Atlantic Trading Estate in 2011 In January 2007, it was announced that a household waste recycling centre was planned at the Atlantic Trading Estate for the \\"recycling of glass, aluminium, plastic, battery boxes, fluorescent tubes, gas, oil, white goods and other waste\\". Oil recycling tank facilities were added to the centre in 2011. In 2014 it was reported that MDA Renewables Ltd plans on building a 25-metre-high 100 kW turbine on the southern boundary of the estate, declaring: \\"The proposed development will create a sustainable and renewable form of energy which will assist in meeting the Welsh Government's objectives in terms of reducing carbon emissions and minimising the causes of climate change.\\" Archaeological site The site has been excavated and radiocarbon dated. Middle Bronze Age wares were uncovered, as well as \\"beaker, food vessel, and collared urn\\" remnants within a round-house built of planks. An Iron Age \\"rim and a basal angle of a vessel\\" was also among the findings unearthed at the site. More than 40 burials in wind-blown sand were situated within a small, unenclosed Roman cemetery; it is considered rare for the Late Roman period in southeastern Wales. Genetic links were identified between skeletons, giving \\"the impression of an extended family group\\". During the construction of the former Supply Reserve Depot, workmen discovered human remains, some of which were found in lead coffins with scallop-shell decoration; no official record of the discovery was made, as much of the lead was sold as scrap metal.

Their touring live band consisted of drummer Rob Ernst, guitarist Ian Holubiak, and bassist Shaun Savage. Oh Honey described itself as a blend of folk pop, indie pop, and pop music. History Mitchy Collins started Oh Honey as a project following his associations with The Kin and Outasight. Looking for a female vocalist, he met Danni Bouchard through a mutual friend. Oh Honey began recording in Brooklyn, NY as a group in April 2013, releasing its first single in September 2013. The band is named after both the \\"Oh Honey\\" episode of How I Met Your Mother and the artisan, rooftop honey production movement in Brooklyn. Oh Honey's EP, With Love was released independently in November 2013 and was well-reviewed. In December 2013, Oh Honey worked with Orange Is the New Black stars Danielle Brooks and Uzo Aduba to create a Christmas medley. Throughout the end of 2013 and the start of 2014, the single Be Okay gained quick and steady acclaim, being covered on Glee on the March 25, 2014, episode titled New Directions. After signing to Atlantic Records in February 2014 via its Fueled by Ramen imprint, Oh Honey set up three tours as the opening act to James Blunt, The Fray, and American Authors, and played at SXSW. The EP With Love was re- released under the Atlantic Records label on March 25, 2014. On August 12, 2014, Oh Honey released an EP of remixes of \\"Be Okay\\". In the fall of 2014, \\"Be Okay\\" was featured in national commercials for The Hundred-Foot Journey, the new ABC show Selfie, and the Chili's restaurant chain. On October 11, 2014, Oh Honey released a second EP of original music titled Sincerely Yours. The band indicated that 4 EPs, With Love, Sincerely Yours, Wish You Were Here and yet-to-be-released Until Next Time would culminate as a full series called Postcards. Oh Honey cited its influences from a number of sources including Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles, Regina Spektor, Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, Bon Iver, Bruce Springsteen, and Ryan Adams. Oh Honey's sound has been compared to Of Monsters and Men, American Authors, Sara Bareilles, The Lumineers, and Icona Pop.

Majesty Hammond (Kingston), the sister of a successful ranch owner, arrives that night and Gene in a drunken revel threatens old Padre Marcos (Swickard) with death unless he marries them.

She finally persuades him to return. He has advised Bonita (Boardman) to take refuge in the crags when she is about to be accused of the murder of a man who fought for her. Majesty does not understand the relationship between Gene and Bonita. When the desperado Don Carlos attacks the ranch, Gene saves Majesty from the Mexicans. Majesty sees Gene talking to Bonita and becomes jealous. Gene is taken captive by Don Carlos and is condemned to death.

The film documents Williams' seven years as premier, including his clash with Prime Minister Stephen Harper over equalization payments and his subsequent Anything But Conservative campaign during the Canadian federal election.

The militant group has also stated its intentions to attack American targets in the Indian Subcontinent. This group is listed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, United States, Canada, India and Pakistan.  History  =Before Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent= Before coming together under AQIS, there were various jihadist factions operating in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. One of these factions operated in Karachi, Pakistan, and were responsible for numerous attacks in the city. On 11 December 2014, AQIS issued a report detailing these attacks. The attacks targeted local police, a professor, and a blogger. =As Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent= On 3 September 2014, Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qaeda, announced the establishment of a new branch in the Indian subcontinent in a 55-minute video posted online. During the announcement, Zawahiri stated that it had taken two years to gather various jihadist factions into the new group, and introduced Asim Umar, an Indian national and a former commander of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as its Emir. The announcement also introduced the group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, who praised militant commanders like Amjad Farooqi, Ilyas Kashmiri and Hassan Ghul. Farooqi was killed by Pakistani security forces. Kashmiri and Ghul were killed by US drone strikes in Pakistan. On 11 December 2014, Pakistani police arrested Shahid Usman, the head of the al-Qaeda wing in Karachi, and four others in Karachi along with weapons and 10 kg of explosives. Ustad Ahmad Farooq, the deputy emir for AQIS, was killed on 15 January 2015 following a US drone strike in South Waziristan. Qari ‚ÄòImran, a member of the group‚Äôs ruling Shura Council, was killed on 5 January 2015 in a drone strike in North Waziristan. In July 2018, United States had designated Asim Umar a global terrorist. Despite Zawahiri's announcement, Al Qaeda could not succeed in making any direct presence in India. Although some Kashmiris were arrested for assisting al Qaeda in the country, there is no evidence of any organized presence of the group in the region. Specifically, there has been no record of territorial claim, group activity or kidnapping of civilian or government officials by Al Qaeda. Some experts also suggest that Al Qaeda have links with some local Kashmiri factionist groups to spread insurgency in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told CNN in an interview with Fareed Zakaria that Indian Muslims would not be allied with Al Qaeda because of their patriotism, modernity and literacy. On 23 September 2019, Afghan officials announced that they had killed Asim Umar, the head of al-Qaeda in Indian subcontinent, during a joint US-Afghan military raid in Helmand province of Afghanistan. 40 Afghan civilians and 6 other Al-Qaeda militants were also killed in this raid. Relations with other Jihadist factions In October, a Kashmiri militant group calling itself \\"Ansar ut- Tawhid wal Jihad in Kashmir\\" published a video expressing support for Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. The group offered to provide shelter to foreign fighters within AQIS as well as fight alongside it. AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud, in series of tweets, expressed support for militant groups in Chechnya, Dagestan, and Yemen. He also gave a eulogy for al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a US drone strike. Media On 19 October 2014, a 117-page English-language magazine called Resurgence was released online. It was produced by the Subcontinent branch of Al Qaeda's As- Sahab media production house, and the articles focused on waging jihad in the Indian Subcontinent. =Statements= Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent has released multiple statements, mainly via the Twitter account of Usama Mahmoud, the group's spokesperson. On 13 September 2014, Usama Mahmoud claimed responsibility for the attempted raid on a Pakistani naval frigate and the assassination of Pakistani Brigader Zahoor Ahmad Fazal in Punjab Province. On 17 September, Mahmoud released a statement which justified the attempted attack on the Pakistani frigate, stating that America was the primary enemy of AQIS. On September 30, AQIS released another statement which said that the intended targets were the American and Indian navies. On 14 October 2014, Mahmoud confirmed that AQIS senior leader Imran Ali Siddiqi was killed in a US drone strike. He also spoke about the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. Siddiqi was a member of the group's Shura council. On 4 November 2014, Mahmoud released a series of tweets that condemned what he said as the \\"Infidel System.\\" He also prayed for god to support militants in Chechnya, Dagestan, and Yemen, as well as Iraq and Syria. The following day, Mahmoud released a statement giving condolences to the killing of Somali al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Abdi Godane. He directed a statement to Somali fighters which said that the US must be fought. AQIS released an audio message from its leader, Asim Umar, on 10 November 2014. Umar eulogized AQIS Shura Council member Imran Ali Siddiqi, who was killed in a US drone strike in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. On 20 November 2014, AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud released a statement confirming the death of two officials of the group in a US raid on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. One of the officials owned the house that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed lived in when he was captured. Four days later, Mahmoud gave a eulogy for the two officials, and urged Pakistani doctors and military officers to follow their example. On 5 December 2014, AQIS published a photo showing the two officials who were killed in the US raid on the Afghan- Pakistani border, as well as a photo of the deceased son of one of the officials. On 20 December 2014, Usama Mahmoud, spokesman for AQIS, condemned an attack on a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, which was carried out by the Pakistani Taliban. He said that the attack was un-Islamic and that \\"the massacre of innocent children makes our hearts burst.\\"  Claimed, alleged and repudiated attacks  As of now, AQIS have carried out multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan and Bangladesh - *The group took responsibility for the 2 September 2014 assassination of Brigadier Fazal Zahoor, a senior officer in the Pakistani Army, who was shot dead by men riding motorcycles. *Spokesman Usama Mahmoud claimed responsibility for a 6 September 2014 attack on a Naval dockyard in Karachi, reportedly carried out by former Pakistan Navy officers, who unsuccessfully tried to hijack a F-22P frigate. Three attackers were killed and seven were arrested by Pakistani forces. *Spokesman Usama Mahmoud condemned on 20 December 2014 the Peshawar school attack. * In video released on 2 May 2015, AQIS claimed responsibility for the death of four Bangladeshi bloggers; Avijit Roy, Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, Ahmed Rajib Haider and AKM Shafiul Islam. They also claimed responsibility for killing two Pakistani citizens, Dr Shakil Auj and blogger Aneeqa Naz. They mentioned Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. * In 7 April 2016, a blogger was stabbed to death in Bangladesh by some Islamist militias. AQIS claimed responsibility. * In 25 April 2016, AQIS claimed responsibility for the death of an LGBT activist in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Criticism The group has been condemned by other Muslim religious and political organizations including the Association of Indian Muslims, Indian American Muslim Council, Indian Minorities Advocacy Network, Indian Muslim Educational Foundation of North America, Indian Muslim Relief and Charities, Muslim Youth Awareness Alliance in India, and the Hefazat-e- Islam Bangladesh and Khelafat Majlish in Bangladesh and Burmese Muslim Association in Myanmar. A spokesman for Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh added: > There is prevailing a congenial and peaceful environment in Bangladesh. > People are living in peace and in such a situation the announcement by Al > Qaeda chief Zawahiri has made the people fearful and worried.

Biography Henderson received a B.A. in History from Dartmouth College, an M.A. in Philosophical Foundations of Education from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, and an Ed.D. in Curriculum & Teaching Studies from Stanford University. He then became assistant professor at Roosevelt University, where he was promoted to associate professor; he originally came to Kent State at that rank, before being promoted to full professor in 1996. At Kent State, he became co-director of the Teacher Leader Endorsement Program in 2010. He was coordinator of curriculum and instruction, of their masters (M.Ed.), educational specialist (Ed.S.), and doctoral (Ph.D.) programs from 2003 to 2008. Henderson created the concept of teaching for democratic living and the curriculum structure known as 3S Understanding. This structure emphasizes that teachers should encourage self-learning, social learning and subject matter when instructing their students. Henderson advances this model for students through the twelfth grade, but author Laurel Chehayl proposes that it can be used in postsecondary settings. Henderson has also promoted the concept of artistry in curriculum development. Henderson's 3S Understanding concept has been used to frame the study of delivery methods such as asynchronous online courses. Henderson co- founded the Journal of Curriculum and Pedagogy with Patrick Slattery in 2004. He has been Section Editor of JCT: Journal of Curriculum Theorizing. He has written or co-written seven books; three of them have been translated into Chinese. He has served on the advisory board for the John Dewey Project on Progressive Education.

She founded and endowed created an award in 1935 for non-fiction books that advance racial understanding, and in 1941 expanded the award to include fiction and poetry; the awards are now called the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.  Life and career  Born in 1889 to Jewish parents,\\"The Biggest Little-Known Book Award\\" Belt Magazine 2013. Retrieved August 19, 2015. Daniela (Guttenberg) and John Anisfield (born in Vienna), in Cleveland, Ohio, she was her parents‚Äô only child. Her father, a successful clothing manufacturer, realtor, civic leader and philanthropist, encouraged her extensive education, and well-developed passion for social welfare. Able to read in French, German and Spanish, Wolf devoted her life to literature and charitable work. She was an active volunteer at the Cleveland Public Library for twenty years, serving as a trustee from 1943 to 1946. And she managed her father‚Äôs philanthropy and the family holdings. A prolific poet, Wolf published several poetry books including Snacks (1934), Cinquainiana (1935), Twin Brochures (1939), Balance (1942), and Wordmobile (1956). Edith married attorney Eugene E. Wolf on August 7, 1918. She and Eugene had no children. Upon her death, Edith willed all her books to the Cleveland Public Library, her family home on East Boulevard to the Cleveland Welfare Federation, and funds to The Cleveland Foundation for a $5,000 community service award, aid for the needy, and continuation of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards. Her remains were interred at the mausoleum at Knollwood Cemetery. =Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards= In 1935, she created an annual book award for non-fiction books that advance racial understanding, which she named the John Anisfield Award in honor of her father. In 1941 she added a second prize for creative literature in honor of her husband, and the awards were collectively called the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards. While Wolf never participated in the selection of awardees, she made certain that the Anisfield-Wolf juries were composed of highly respected literary figures. Ashley Montagu served as jury chairman from 1954 through 1995. Since 1996, the jury has been headed by Henry Louis Gates Jr..

Among Santo collectors, the image is often referred to the \\"fraternal twin\\" of the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫, with which it shares crucial similarities on posture, gesture, facial expression, and measurement.Ocampo, Ambleth R., \\"Santo Ni√±o in the Louvre\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, May 06, 2015 In September 2009, the image was privately acquired and now housed in the Louvre Museum under security glass. It is displayed naked without any regalia, accessories or vestments formerly associated with other Child Jesus icons. Description The image depicts Jesus Christ in his infancy stage. The polychrome materials and characteristics are distinctly from Mechelen, a former part of the Southern Netherlands dating from the early 1500s. The child image alone is made of walnut, carved in a single block piece of wood. The present image is untouched, devoid of any professional restoration work and comprises the following details: * A cross presumably attached to the Globus Cruciger is missing, and is replaced with a modern finial. * The uncircumcised phallus of the image is mutilated, unrestored. * The right forearm of the image is cracked and broken, but was re-attached. * The feet of the child is attach√©d to its hexagonal peana or red lacquered base using two metal rods (similar to Napolitan Jesus images). * The frontal hexagonal base made of oak wood is adorned with floral and bead carvings. * The facial resemblance of the image is playfully frolic, with a pinched mouth and pinkish cheekbones. * The image follows the \\"Salvator Mundi\\" style of Christological depiction. * The curled hair is gilded with pure gold leaf. No evidence of hair wig in place. Evidence of European colonial characteristics are present on the statue, such as the gilding of the hair using gold leaf while lead paint and oily potassium is used to the skin, similar to the Encarnacion style of sculpting and painting. Further microscopic examination show research that the image was carved in Mechelen, but was probably painted in Brussels then taken to be distributed in the colonized territories of Spain. Comparison with the Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ image Both the Mechelen statues and the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ are approximately the same height at approximately 30 cm (12 inches) tall, while having similar characteristics such as the standing pose, naked body, hand blessing gesture and golden globes. Assuming that the camera shots are frontally accurate, the faces are almost exactly similar to one another with the following exceptions: *In published photographs, the Mechelen statue looks frontal and towards in a direct line, while the Cebu statue looks in a downward direction to the devotee * The Cebu statue's fingers lean to the left, while that of the Mechelen statue points to the right. The original wooden fingers however point upwards when the golden glove is removed. * The Mechelen statue's hair is sculpted all the way to the knape or close to the neckline, while the Cebu statue looks like it is only up to the earlobes. Acquisition by the Louvre Museum The history of acquisition and ownership is unknown and unpublished by the Louvre or Parisian authorities. The image was acquired from a private collector in September 2009 by the Louvre Endowment Fund. It underwent polychrome study, xylology inspection, and radiography to confirm its age and colonial style of authenticity. The image is housed in the Louvre Museum under the Department of Sculptures. Several pious American Traditionalist Catholics from Texas and New York petitioned the Louvre Endowment fund to purchase and release the custody of the image in 2012 but this petition was not granted. The French magazine La Tribune de l'art featured the image on 16 June 2010 as part of recent Medieval acquisitions by the Louvre Museum.

Corinth (18:1‚Äì11) This part records the founding of the church in Corinth, which was administrative center of the Roman province of Achaea and to become an important center for the Paul's mission. Luke notes the first meeting of Paul with Aquila and Priscilla (verse 2), who are to become his important associates, well known to the Corinthian church (1 Corinthians 16:19; cf. Romans 16:3-4). =Verse 1= :After these things Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth. NKJV Paul traveled from Athens to Corinth, a distance of about 82 km on modern roads. =Verse 2= :And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them. NKJV References to the action of Roman Emperor Claudius (in office AD 41-54) to command \\"all the Jews to depart from Rome\\" appear in the writings of Roman historians Suetonius (c. AD 69 ‚Äì c. AD 122), Cassius Dio (c. AD 150 ‚Äì c. 235) and fifth-century Christian author Paulus Orosius. Scholars generally agree that these references refer to the same incident as in this verse.Rainer Riesner \\"Pauline Chronology\\" in Stephen Westerholm The Blackwell Companion to Paul (May 16, 2011) pp.13-14Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum, The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament (2009) p. 110, 400 =Verse 5= : When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. NKJV Luke simplified the story of Paul's mission in Corinth as it follows a familiar sequence (verses 4‚Äì5). *\\"Silas and Timothy\\": see , . Gallio (18:12‚Äì17) Following a relatively quiet period of church growth, opposition flares up again and Paul is brought before the proconsul Gallio. Proconsuls were in office only for one year, so this name provides an important chronological indicator for Luke's narrative, one of the key dates for New Testament chronology. =Verse 12= Fragment of Delphi Inscription with the name ŒìŒëŒõŒõŒØŒ©Œù (\\"Gallion\\") - Delphi museum : When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat, NKJV Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus or Gallio was a Roman senator and brother of famous writer Seneca. He was the proconsul of Achaia. According to this chapter, he dismissed the charge brought by the Jews against the Apostle Paul. (Acts 18:12‚Äì17) His behaviour on this occasion (\\"but Gallio cared for none of these things\\", v. 17) showed his disregard for Jewish sensitivities, and also the impartial attitude of Roman officials towards Christianity in its early days. Gallio's tenure can be fairly accurately dated to between 51‚Äì52 AD.John Drane,\\"An Introduction to the Bible\\",Lion, 1990, p.634-635 The reference to proconsul Gallio in the Delphi Inscription, or Gallio Inscription (IG, VII, 1676; SIG, II, 801d; AD 52)The Gallio Inscription at http://users.wfu.edu provides an important marker for developing a chronology of the life of Apostle Paul by relating it to the trial of Paul in Achaea mentioned in this chapter.A.

Dunn (Nov 10, 2003) Cambridge Univ Press page 20 Therefore, the events of Acts 18 can be dated to this period. This is significant because it is the most accurately known date in the life of Paul.Pauline Chronology: His Life and Missionary Work, from Catholic Resources by Felix Just, S.J. Matthew Henry claims that the crowd that beat up Sosthenes was enraged at Paul and Gallio. They demonstrated that if Gallio would not judge that they would. Gallio's indifference to the case against Paul could be commendable for its impartiality. However Gallio's indifference to the beating up of an innocent man, Sosthenes, carried indifference too far, not only showing a contempt for the case, but also for the people presenting the case. Return to Base (18:18-23) At some point after a long and successful mission in Corinth, Paul decides to return to his base in Syria. =Verse 18= Corinth (Corinthus): Lechaeum (Lechaion) and Cenchreae (Cenchrea) :So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow. NKJV Matthew Henry claimed that the original text is ambiguous as to who had their hair cut off, it could have been Aquila or Paul. The vow was likely a Nazarite vow with the hair cut signifying completion of the vow period. *\\"Cenchrea\\" on the east side of the isthmus was one of two ports for Corinth. It was used for sea journeys to the east via the Saronic Gulf. The other port, Lechaion on the Corinthian Gulf, served the trade routes leading west (to Italy and beyond).J. L. Rife, \\"Religion and Society at Roman Kenchreai\\" in S. J. Friesen, D. N. Schowalter, J. C. Walters (ed.), Corinth in Context: Comparative Studies on Religion and Society (Supplements to Novum Testamentum, 134), Leiden & Boston: Brill 2010 In the Epistle to the Romans a church was mentioned to be there, of which Phoebe was a deacon and patron (Romans 16:1‚Äì2). Interlude: Apollos in Corinth (18:24-28) In an interlude, Luke gives a rare glimpse of Apollos, an Alexandrian Jew, an independent missionary at work within the almost-exclusive Pauline sphere. Apollos is a member of one of the largest Jewish communities in the ancient world, with a complex and well-established tradition of philosophical hermeneutics of which Philo is the best-known proponent (cf. 1 Corinthians 1:12; 3:4-9; 4:6; 16:12). Perhaps because he displays some of the 'wisdom' that Paul lacks, Apollos has gained a following within the Corinthian church. Apollos received a sufficiently Christian instruction (katechesis) to speak about 'the way of the Lord' (verse 25), but it stops short at the 'baptism of John' (Acts 19:3). Priscilla and Aquila presumably heard Apollos in the synagogue and then provide whatever further instruction is needed (verse 26). =Verse 26= :And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

It is approximately long and flows through Davidson Township. Its watershed has an area of . The stream has a low pH and poor water quality. The main rock formations in the area are the Huntley Mountain Formation and the Burgoon Sandstone. The main soil associations in the vicinity of the stream are the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga association, and the Oquaga association. Course Ore Run begins in Davidson Township, near the northern edge of the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed. It flows southeast for a short distance, entering a steep valley. The stream then turns southwest and flows down the valley. At the bottom of the valley, it reaches its confluence with Sullivan Branch. =Tributaries= Ore Run has one small, unnamed tributary. It is known as Unt 28017. Hydrology The discharge of Ore Run during average flow conditions is 481 gallons per minute. The pH of the stream during average flow conditions is 4.32. The pH ranges from 4 to less than 4.5. The concentration of aluminum during average flow conditions is 0.366 milligrams per liter. Ore Run experiences chronic acidification. During average flow conditions, the water quality of the stream is \\"severe\\", a rating worse than \\"very poor\\". It also has this level of water quality during high flow conditions. The stream requires an additional alkalinity load of per day to be restored to the satisfaction of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan. Ore Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by atmospheric deposition due to metals and pH, as is its unnamed tributary. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Ore Run is above sea level. The lower reaches of Ore Run flow over rock of the Huntley Mountain Formation. The upper reaches of the stream flow over rock of the Burgoon Sandstone formation. Rock outcroppings are present in the watershed. The entire length of the stream flows over soil of the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association, except for the headwaters, which are on soil of the Oquaga and another, minor soil association. Most of these soils are highly acidic. There is a bed of iron ore on Ore Run. Watershed The watershed of Ore Run has an area of . Ore Run is difficult to access. The Ore Run Falls are a cascade and slide waterfall on Ore Run. They are high. Ore Run is designated for use by aquatic life. History The restoration of Ore Run is part of the fourth phase of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan. This phase is estimated to cost $400,000, making it the most expensive phase of the restoration plan. The stream was first listed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as impaired in 2002. The total maximum daily load date is 2015.

Following high-school graduation he joined the Israel Defense Forces, and served as an officer in the Education Corps. Raz Yirmiya obtained a bachelor's degree in Psychobiology from Haifa University and M.Sc. in Physiology from the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. He did his Ph.D. in Neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. John C. Liebeskind at the University of California, Los Angeles, US.

Raz Yirmiya is married to Professor Nurit Yirmiya and they have 4 children. Raz Yirmiya CV Scientific career In his initial studies during the early 1990s Yirmiya demonstrated that psychoactive drugs, particularly alcohol and opiates, modulate immune functioning and resistance to cancer via brain-to-immune communication pathways.

N., Acute alcohol intoxication suppresses natural killer cell activity in vivo and promotes tumor metastasis. Nature Medicine, 2: 457-460, 1996. After establishing his laboratory in Jerusalem, Yirmiya focused on the implications of immune-to-brain signaling and using animal models of various infectious, autoimmune and neurological diseases he established the relationships between brain inflammatory cytokines and sickness behavior symptoms. He is specifically known for providing the first experimental evidence for a relationship between immune activation and major depression.

Twenty years of research on cytokine-induced sickness behavior. Brain Behav Immun. 21:153-60. 2007. Who stated: \\"Raz Yirmiya was the first psychobiologist to draw the analogy between sickness behavior and depression. He showed that rats treated with cytokines are less sensitive to the rewarding properties of a saccharin solution or to the presentation of a sexually-active partner. Some of these deficits can be prevented by chronic but not acute administration of antidepressant drugs that have little or no beneficial effects on sickness behavior.\\" In parallel studies, Yirmiya employed unique controlled and prospective experimental models of disease in humans, demonstrating that immune challenges, such as endotoxin administration, rubella vaccination or minor surgery, induce cytokine-mediated disturbances in behavioral, emotional and cognitive functions. Reichenberg, A., Yirmiya, R., Schuld, A., Kraus, T., Haak, M., Morag, A., and Pollm√§cher T., Cytokine-mediated emotional and cognitive disturbances in humans.

Together, these studies directly contributed to the formation of novel conceptualizations and the development of clinically effective treatments for inflammation-associated major depression. In recent years, Yirmiya discovered that microglia cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain play a critical role in normal neuro- behavioral processes, including hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation, neural plasticity, neurogenesis, and the modulation of these processes by environmental enrichment.

Scott, who originally started his career as a rap artist was born to parents that were both professional actors/dancers who met while touring with various music productions. His mother was the first African-American female dancer to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show. Scott received some training in jazz as a child, but was excited enough by the hip-hop innovations of Run-D.M.C. to pursue a music career as a rap artist. His music blends jazz, funk, hip-hop and soul, along with social consciousness and a sense of humor.Dred Scott BioAllmusic Dred Scott's debut album, Breakin' Combs on A&M; Records, was released in 1994. The album achieved moderate success thanks to the underground singles \\"Check the Vibe\\" and \\"Back in the Day,\\" which featured R&B; singer and future wife Adriana Evans. The pair met while in college, which led to Adriana's appearance on Scott's \\"Breakin' Combs\\". In 1995, Scott and Evans wrote and recorded her pioneering self-titled debut album on Capitol Records released in 1997. The album featured Scott's hip-hop-centric production backing Evans' jazz-influenced vocals; combined with live instrumentation, it was a significant departure from the R&B; of the day.

Nicholls, The Flower Seller, Venice, 1883Burr H. Nicholls, An Old New England Bridge Burr H. Nicholls (December 9, 1848 ‚Äì May 12, 1915) was an American painter who studied art with Carolus-Duran in Paris and first exhibited his work in London at Dudley Gallery. Most of his works were based upon scenes from the seven years that he studied and lived in Europe. Nicholls was married three times, but it was his marriage to his second wife, Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, that caused a media sensation across the United States. In 1897 both Burr and Rhoda Nicholls submitted paintings to the Paris Salon; Rhoda's was accepted with honorable mention but Burr's was rejected. This triggered a period of marital discontent followed by separation. Their divorce was finalized in 1906 and was reported in many American newspapers. Journalists warned women of the peril of pursuing vocations that put them in competition with their husbands. Early life Burr H. Nicholls was born in Lockport, New York to Luman Nicholls and Ann Halliday Nicholls. Painters in his family included his mother and his nephew Henry, son of his brother Mark. Henry made copies of several of Burr's paintings including a Brittany farm scene and The Red Staircase. Marriage His first of three marriages was to Alice McDonald or Alethea P. McConnell in 1871; she died in 1876. Nicholls met the English artist Rhoda Holmes during a trip to Venice. They married in 1884 at Lyminster Church in Sussex, England, honeymooned in Venice and sailed for the United States in the spring of 1884. The couple exhibited their works in some of the same shows, like the Chicago Interstate Industrial Expositions. In 1893 the Nicholls lived in a \\"cosey\\" home and both had studios on the top floor. By 1896, Nicholls lived with his wife in a West 50th Street mansion in New York City with their daughter and son, Rhoda Olive and Arundel Holmes Nicholls. The couple's marriage became contentious when in 1897 one of Rhoda Holmes Nicholls works was accepted with honorable mention by the Paris Salon, but Burr's work was denied. The couple separated the following year. Their divorce was finalized by September 18, 1906 and \\"newspapers widely warned women about the dangers of success and its potential influence on marital and domestic bliss.\\" His final marriage was to Josephine Lewis of Buffalo, New York. Her brother was Dr. Park Lewis, a \\"well-known physician\\". Education and career Nicholls studied art in Buffalo, New York with Lars (L.G.) Sellstedt and with Carolus-Duran at the Paris Beaux Arts. He studied and worked in England, Paris, Italy and Brittany for seven years which provided inspiration for his paintings for years. Most of Nicholl's paintings were made of European subjects and settings, like A Street Scene in France and A Quiet Corner, Venice, exhibited at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 held in Buffalo, New York. His first exhibition was in 1879 at London's Dudley Gallery. Nicholls exhibited at \\"every important exhibition in America\\" and the Paris Salon. His work was favorably received at the 1891 Society for the Promotion of Art exhibition at Eden Mus√©e [New York]. The Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, now the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, had acquired works by Nicholls by 1882. He and his third wife were members of the Buffalo Historical Society.

The fifteenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and seventh major hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Norbert originated from an area of disturbed weather in association with an area of low pressure on September 2\\\\. Tracking generally northwestward, the newly designated tropical storm steadily organized in a moderate shear environment. Norbert attained hurricane intensity early on September 4 and Category 2 hurricane strength the next afternoon. Thereafter, the cyclone began a period of rapid deepening, and it subsequently attained its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg) early on September 6\\\\. A track over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment prompted a weakening trend after peak intensity, and by early on September 8, the system no longer maintained enough convection to be considered a tropical cyclone. Meteorological history On August 30, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated the potential for an area of low pressure to form offshore the coastline of Mexico and slowly develop over subsequent days. This projection came to fruition the next afternoon, when a large area of showers and thunderstorms in association with a trough of low pressure was noted. Amid a generally favorable environment with moderate wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, convection steadily coalesced atop a distinct low-level circulation, and the disturbance acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical cyclone at 15:00 UTC on September 2; it was designated Tropical Storm Norbert in accordance with an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass. Due to moderate northeasterly wind shear, only modest intensification was predicted. Norbert moved generally northwestward succeeding formation, steered around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge across Baja California and northern Mexico. All the while, the cloud pattern of the cyclone progressively improved, with a symmetric central dense overcast and distinct rainbands on convectional satellite, and a formative inner core with hints of a small mid- level eye on hurricane imagery. In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, Norbert was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on September 4. Dolly (right) straddling both coasts of Mexico at 17:30 UTC on September 2 Continuing on a general northwestward trajectory, increased easterly wind shear caused the system to temporarily lose organization during the pre-dawn hours of September 4 as the low- and mid-level circulations became dislocated. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Norbert that afternoon, recording peak flight-level winds of 97 mph (156 km/h), maximum surface winds of 90 mph (145 km/h), and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 mb (hPa; 28.65 inHg). Early on September 6, the cyclone began a period of unexpected rapid deepening; at 00:00 UTC, it was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane, and at 06:00 UTC, it intensified a major hurricane, a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. After attaining its peak intensity with maximum winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg), Norbert began to track over cooler sea surface temperatures, and a weakening trend ensued. It was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane at 21:00 UTC on September 6, and further to a Category 1 hurricane at 03:00 UTC the next day. Deep convection associated with Norbert began to wane significantly as the storm entered a stable environment, and a blend of satellite intensity estimates prompted the NHC to downgrade it to a tropical storm at 15:00 UTC. At 09:00 UTC on September 8, after having been devoid of deep, organized convection for over 12 hours, the system was declared a post- tropical cyclone. During the next few days, Nobert's remnants made a northward loop, before dissipating on September 11. Preparations Despite remaining well offshore the Mexican coast, classes in Manzanillo were suspended for a day. A \\"yellow\\" (moderate) alert was activated for Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco. Elsewhere, an \\"orange\\" (high) alert was issued for Soccoro Island, San Benedicto Island, and Baja California Sur. The southern portions of the state of Sonora was placed under a \\"yellow\\" alert, while a green alert was declared for the northern portions. The port of Guaymas was closed for small craft. Along the Baja California Peninsula officials activated 900 emergency workers to assist in the supply of food and fuel. Additionally, 164 shelters were opened. On September 5, the \\"orange\\" alert was upped to a \\"red\\" (maximum) alert. When the remnants of Norbert spread into the United States, local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and warnings, with watches posted across portions of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. Several schools in Arizona were closed or delayed due to flooding. Mexican impact Roads surrounding Manzanillo were closed for three hours due to landslides. Further north, several homes in Jalisco were flooded. In Nayarit, three people were evacuated to shelters. A man died in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa after being swept away by a swollen stream, and two women in Chihuahua drowned while driving across a flooded creek. In Puerto San Carlos, a mudslide forced 425 people from two hotels to seek shelter. A dam collapsed northwest of the city due to the rains, causing flooding deep in the town. The resultant floods damaged 2,500 homes and left about 2,500 people homeless, about one- third of its population. Throughout the municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, and Comondu, 2,000 people were evacuated to shelters, including 785 people in La Paz alone.
