Perel promoted the concept of \\"erotic intelligence\\" in her book Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence (2006), which has been translated into 24 languages. After publishing the book, she became an international advisor on sex and relationships. She gave a TED talk in February 2013 called \\"The secret to desire in a long-term relationship\\", and another in March 2015 called \\"Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved.\\" Perel is the host of the podcast Where Should We Begin?, which is based inside her therapist's office as she sees anonymous couples in search of insight into topics such as infidelity, sexlessness and grief. In 2016, Perel was added to Oprah Winfrey's Supersoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.http://www.supersoul.tv/category/supersoul-100/the-complete-list Biography Perel is Jewish, the daughter of two Polish-born Holocaust survivors. She was raised in Antwerp, Belgium and attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. theguardian.com nytimes.com She grew up amongst Holocaust survivors in Antwerp, and noted two groups around her: \\"those who didn't die, and those who came back to life\\". She observed that \\"those who didn't die were people who lived tethered to the ground, afraid, untrusting. The world was dangerous, and pleasure was not an option. You cannot play, take risks, or be creative when you don't have a minimum of safety, because you need a level of unself-consciousness to be able to experience excitement and pleasure. Those who came back to life were those who understood eroticism as an antidote to death.\\" Perel subsequently trained in psychodynamic psychotherapy before finding a professional home in family systems theory. She initially worked as a cross-cultural psychotherapist with couples and families. For 13 years she was a clinical instructor at the New York University School of Medicine. Perel has also worked as an actress (appearing in the 2017 film, Newness, as herself) and run a clothing boutique in Antwerp. Perel in Boston in 2017 Perel is married to Jack Saul, Assistant Professor of Clinical Population and Family Health at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, with whom she has two sons.  Ideas  Perel argues that, due to trends such as the secularization of Western society, the rise of individualism, and the societal \\"mandate\\" for personal happiness, the expectations for romantic relationships are higher than ever: > Never before have our expectations of marriage taken on such epic > proportions. We still want everything the traditional family was meant to > provide—security, children, property, and respectability—but now we also > want our partner to love us, to desire us, to be interested in us. We should > be best friends, trusted confidants, and passionate lovers to boot. She also notes the ideals of modern marriage are often contradictory: \\"We want our chosen one to offer stability, safety, predictability, and dependability—all the anchoring experiences. And we want that very same person to supply awe, mystery, adventure, and risk.\\" Perel calls for a more open and honest discussion of monogamy to reconcile this conflict between the erotic and the domestic. Podcasts Perel is the host of two podcasts: Where Should We Begin? and How's Work? * Where Should We Begin? brings the listeners inside Perel's therapist's office as she sees anonymous couples in search of insight on everything from infidelity to sexlessness to grief. The unique format combines live recordings of the therapy session, with Perel's reflections on what she heard, and what techniques she tried. The New York Times writes: \\"it feels more like an unraveling mystery story than a relationship advice show.\\" The couples include both heterosexual and same-sex couples. The first episode aired on Audible in May 2017, and became publicly available on iTunes on October 9, 2017. Three seasons have been released as of December 2019. Where Should We Begin? received a 2018 Gracie Award. * How's Work? is Perel's second podcast. It follows a format similar to the couples therapy session in Where Should We Begin? — but this time the couple seeking Perel's advice are cofounders or colleagues, navigating the challenges that play out in work relationships. HuffPost describes each episode as a \\"one-time therapy session between Perel and various co-founders, members of family businesses and partners with a thriving operation but deteriorating relations on the job.\\" As described in one review: \\"The podcast aims to shine light on the things that form us as individuals and how those things relate to life in the workplace. Because, honestly, a lot of people hold their careers and workplace relationships as dearly and tightly as they do their romantic relationships.\\" How's Work? is created by Gimlet Media, and available exclusively on Spotify.

Several equivalent forms of the relation exist, including in terms of angular frequency, : E = \\\\hbar \\\\omega where \\\\hbar = h / 2 \\\\pi. The relation accounts for the quantized nature of light and plays a key role in understanding phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and black-body radiation (where the related Planck postulate can be used to derive Planck's law). Spectral forms Light can be characterized using several spectral quantities, such as frequency , wavelength , wavenumber \\\\scriptstyle\\\\tilde{ u}, and their angular equivalents (angular frequency , angular wavelength , and angular wavenumber ). These quantities are related through : u = \\\\frac{c}{\\\\lambda} = c \\\\tilde u = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2 \\\\pi} = \\\\frac{c}{2 \\\\pi y} = \\\\frac{ck}{2 \\\\pi}, so the Planck relation can take the following 'standard' forms :E = h u = \\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda} = h c \\\\tilde u, as well as the following 'angular' forms, :E = \\\\hbar \\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{y} = \\\\hbar c k.

Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature, the relation would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to . Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to :p = h \\\\tilde u or :p = \\\\hbar k. The de Broglie's relation is also often encountered in vector form :\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k}, where is the momentum vector, and is the angular wave vector.

The Israeli soldiers later stated that he was a \\"terrorist\\", asserting that he had tried to snatch a weapon from a soldier and had also attacked them with a metal pole. The Israeli military's accounting for the incident was disputed both by a witness speaking to the international news media as well as representatives of the government of Jordan, among others. The event became an international incident, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formally issuing a statement of regret. Background and incident details The 38-year-old Raed Zeiter worked as a judge at a magistrates court in Jordan while his hometown was Nablus. Israeli soldiers remarked that he had charged at them with a metal pole, which was disputed by a witness who stated that Zeiter and the soldiers had been arguing before Zeiter was shoved down and shot. The incident occurred at the Allenby Bridge crossing between the Palestinian territories and the nation of Jordan. While the border crossing procedures there are usually recorded, the army later said that the cameras on site had malfunctioned. According to The New York Times, the crossing had very rarely seen acts of violence before. The bridge area is jointly administered by both Jordan and Israel. Reactions Zeiter's father and Jordanian government officials such as Information Minister Mohammad Momani called shortly after the incident for investigations and for the arrest of the border agents involved. \\"My son was unarmed, he wouldn't even know how to use a weapon,\\" Ala Zeiter said. The Israeli military stated that it had conducted a \\"comprehensive investigation\\" to support their view of the incident, including the questioning of multiple witnesses. Jordan's principal Islamist party condemned what it viewed as Israeli \\"brutality\\". Murad Adaileh of the Islamic Action Front said in a statement that \\"the Zionist enemy does not respect any agreements\\" and that the \\"aggression against the Jordanian citizen shows the brutality of the Zionist occupation.\\" Approximately 1000 protesters demonstrated outside the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan and called for expelling the Israeli ambassador. Many of them declared, \\"Down with the peace agreement!\\" The Palestinian Authority publicly advocated for an international investigation into the incident. \\"Israel regrets the death of Judge Raed Zeiter yesterday at the King Hussein (Allenby) bridge and expresses its sympathies to the people and government of Jordan,\\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office declared in a statement. Funeral Hundreds of Palestinians and Jordanians turned out for Zeiter's funeral. His casket wrapped in both a Jordanian flag and a Palestinian flag, his family buried him in their hometown of Nablus.

Under that new status, the Viceroy of India assumed direct control over Aden, which had hitherto been administered by the government of the Bombay Presidency. The Aden Protectorate remained unaffected by this change. Background For nearly a century following the capture of the port of Aden by forces of the East India Company in 1839, the town and immediate surrounding area under direct British rule, known as the Aden Settlement, had been a dependency of the distant Bombay Presidency. The Settlement's indeterminate position at the southwestern end of the Arabian peninsula was bound to cause difficulties and historian R. J. Gavin points out that \\"Aden’s whole history since 1839 had been marked by administrative confusion and complication.\\"R. J. Gavin, Aden Under British Rule, 1839-1967, Barnes and Noble, 1975, p. 254. Before taking action, the chief British official at Aden, the Resident, was often required to obtain sanction from three different authorities, the Bombay Government, the Government of India (headed by the Viceroy) and the Colonial Office in London.Robert R. Robbins, \\"The Legal Status of Aden Colony, and the Aden Protectorate\\", The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 33, No. 4 (Oct., 1939), p. 702. Matters came to a head during World War I and in 1917, the Government of India, recognising its inability to provide sufficient forces to defend Aden against invading Turkish forces, transferred military control of the Settlement to the War Office and control of the Aden Protectorate affairs to the Foreign Office. The transfer was incomplete since India retained control of affairs within the Settlement itself, something which was increasingly seen in London as an anachronism given that Aden so obviously belonged to the Middle East and the Arab world. Things dragged on however and for the next two decades the administration of Aden witnessed incessant bureaucratic wrangling between the Bombay Presidency, the Government of India, the India Office, the Colonial Office and the War Office, \\"which broke through from time to time in the columns of newspapers and on to the floor of the House of Commons and the representative assemblies in India.\\"Gavin, p. 252. The chief disagreement was over the division of costs between India and London, in particular regarding the sizeable defence costs of AdenGavin, p. 253. Another important roadblock to the full transfer of Aden to London was the unpopularity of the Colonial Office among the well- established and powerful Indian commercial community of Aden, which was aware of the discrimination in administration against Indians in British East Africa and feared the same would happen to them if Aden was placed under the control of the Colonial Office.Gavin, p. 253–255. Creation of the Chief Commissioner's Province The territory of British Aden on a 1922 map. The issue gained urgency at the end of the 1920s when discussions on constitutional reforms in India began. Far-away Aden with its Arab majority could not be accommodated in a new federal India where a considerably empowered Bombay legislative assembly would remain in charge. Therefore, it was decided that, until the final status of Aden was decided, Bombay would yield its administrative control over the territory which would become a Chief Commissioner's Province under the direct control of the Viceroy. This status, which took effect on 1 April 1932, was expected to be short-lived, and one provision of the Government of India Act 1935, stated that \\"Aden shall cease to be a part of British India\\". In accordance with the Aden Colony Order, 1936, Aden became a Crown Colony under the full responsibility of the Colonial Office effective 1 April 1937. At the time, the British government had made it clear that it was unwilling to share control of such an vital imperial base or anything pertaining to it with an independent Indian administration.Gavin, p. 256.Glen Balfour-Paul, The End of Empire in the Middle East. Britain's relinquishment of power in her last three dependencies, Cambridge tUniversity Press, 1991, (1996 paperback edition), p. 58–59. However, to mollify the Indian community which still opposed the transfer, links with India were not totally severed. While the District and Sessions Court of Aden became the Supreme Court of the new Colony, appeals could be made to the High Court of Judicature in Bombay in civil cases involving property and some civil rights cases, as well as in criminal cases.Robbins, p. 702.

The large Frank Mohn factory is in Fusa, just southwest of the village centre. The factory here is the marine division of the corporation, specializing in production of cargo pumping systems, transportable pumping system, and anti-heeling pumping systems.

Jack Fallows was born in Cheshire and educated at Worksop College. A club cricketer and Minor Counties player for Cheshire before World War II, and a major during the war,Obituary by John Arlott, The Cricketer, May 1974. he was asked to captain Lancashire in the first season after the war. Despite his inexperience and his negligible batting ability he was a popular captain who led the side to third position in the County Championship with 15 victories in 26 matches. Wisden's report of the Lancashire season noted that \\"under J.A. Fallows the old stigmas of dullness and lack of imagination were overcome. Whatever his limitations as a batsman, the new captain proved shrewd in the field and inspiring everywhere. Willingness to go out for victory and keen finishes ensured maximum interest and enjoyment.\\"Wisden 1947, p. 318. In 2012, assessing the role of the amateur captain in county cricket, Colin Shindler praised Fallows as the archetypal amateur captain: > When only four fresh eggs were available one morning at a London hotel, he > awarded them to the bowlers because Lancashire were likely to be fielding > all day. His team respected and liked him, and he did exactly what an > amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition a chance and his > bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and > the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.Colin Shindler, \\"The > slow death of cricket's class divide\\", Wisden 2012, pp. 42-47. Despite his success, Fallows was replaced as county captain for 1947 by Ken Cranston. He served on the Somerset committee before returning to Lancashire, where he was elected to the committee in 1964. As chairman of the Cricket Subcommittee he helped the county overcome a period of failure to achieve success under the captaincy of Jack Bond in the late 1960s and 1970s.

It features the first new material from the band since their 2011 album, In Some Way, Shape, or Form. Background Four Year Strong released In Some Way, Shape, or Form (2011) through Republic Records-imprint Universal Motown. With the album, the group attempt to explore territory they thought their fans would enjoy; however, they received a negative reaction to it. Following this, the band were moved to Motown's parent label, away from the staff members that had signed them to the label. They eventually parted ways with the company and spent time with their respective families. Vocalist/guitarist Alan Day started the side project The Here and Now, bassist Joe Weiss operated a woodworking company, and vocalist/guitarist Dan O'Connor worked on his house. They eventually reconvened for a writing session; all of the tracks evolved from jam sessions. They purposely focused on incorporating their live energy into the songs when writing. In March and April 2014, the group supported Bayside on their headlining US tour, dubbed The Great American Cult Tour. Following this stint, the band spent more time writing, before they planned to record anything. O'Connor said they had came up with more guitar riffs than they had for Enemy of the World (2010), though he was unsure if their next release was going to be an album or EP. Production and composition Go Down in History was recorded at The Machine Shop in New Jersey with producer Machine. He engineered the sessions with Andy Gomoll and Alberto De Icaza; the latter pair also handled editing. They were assisted by Johnny Rieg throughout the sessions. Machine mixed the recordings with assistance from Icaza; mixing and mastered was also done at The Machine Shop. Go Down in History saw the group move away from the arena rock experimentation of In Some Way, Shape, or Form, and back to the sound of their Rise or Die Trying (2007) and Enemy of the World (2010) albums: riff-centric pop punk with call-and-response vocals from Day and O'Connor. The EP featured the band playing at \\"turbocharged\\" tempos, with \\"intricate\\" guitar riffs; Revolver said the songs acted as a bridge between pop punk and melodic hardcore. \\"What's in the Box?\\" was the most reminiscent of the Rise or Die Trying era. The title-track incorporated gang vocals that recalled the closings tracks of both Rise or Die Trying and Enemy of the World. \\"So You're Saying There's a Chance\\" builds to a hook through a variety of time signature changes. Its title is a reference to the film Dumb and Dumber (1994). Release and reception =Promotion and touring= On May 23, 2014 the band announced they had signed to Pure Noise Records. Though the band had talked to various labels, they met Pure Noise founder Jake Round through mutual friends. After hearing all of the positive things about Round and his label, the group signed with him. Four days later, Go Down in History was announced for release in July. Alongside this, the EP's artwork and track listing was revealed. On June 5, \\"Tread Lightly\\" was made available for streaming. Between June and August, the band performed on the 2014 Warped Tour. On July 11, \\"Living Proof of a Stubborn Youth\\" premiered through AbsolutePunk. On July 18, a music video for \\"Go Down in History\\", filmed on the Warped Tour, premiered through Alternative Press website. Go Down in History was released on July 22. In November, the group embarked on a headlining US tour, with support from Transit, Such Gold and Seaway. In January 2015, they went on another US headlining tour, this time with support from Comeback Kid, Expire, Handguns and Heart to Heart. =Critical response= Go Down in History received generally positive reviews from music critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The release marks a return to form for the band and reverts to their pop punk/melodic hardcore roots for the first time since their 2010 release Enemy of the World, the only difference being the lack of keyboards.

It presently houses the archives of the Foundation of the Istituto Banco di Napoli. The palace is just down the street from the entrance to Castel Capuano History The palace once housed the Banco dei Poveri (Bank of the Poor) arose between the sixteenth century in Naples, and along with nearly eight other such institutions, it was later consolidated into the Banco di Napoli. These institutions served as pawnshops, almshouses, and in the case of the Banco dei Poveri, the proximity to the courts at the Vicaria (Castel Capuano) meant that they often serves as bails-bondsmen. A story, perhaps apocryphal, by Carlo Cerano about the origins of the bank support the latter function. The bank staff was composed of lay religious congregations, and its funds were amassed through alms, income from rental properties, and donations, in the latter case, often of inheritances. The Neapolitan Banco dei Poveri was in competition with the Neapolitan Monte di Pietà - the first Monte in Naples, built in 1539, which made loans without charging interest, to avoid usury injunctions.Instituto Banco di Napoli website. The palace now houses the historical archives of the Banco di Napoli. The palace was bought for nearly 10,000 ducats by the Monte e Banco dei Poveri in 1616 from Gaspare Ricca. In 1787, the adjacent palace was bought from the heirs of Don Pietro Cuomo. The palace was restructured by Giovanni Conforto, and underwent a number of reconstructions. The present late-Baroque facade was designed by Gaetano Barba. The architect Ferdinando Sanfelice designed the interlacing staircases seen in the courtyard. The Chapel of the Congregation of Monte dei Poveri (Cappella della Congregazione di Monte dei Poveri) in the courtyard was designed in 1663 by Don Giuseppe Caracciolo. Nicola Trabucco completed the frescoes in the Audience Hall of the palace, and restored five canvases by Belisario Corenzio. These latter paintings have been moved.

A partially demolished house in Qormi, Malta Demolition, or razing, is the science and engineering in safely and efficiently tearing down of buildings and other artificial structures. Demolition contrasts with deconstruction, which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes. For small buildings, such as houses, that are only two or three stories high, demolition is a rather simple process. The building is pulled down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work platforms, cranes, excavators or bulldozers. Larger buildings may require the use of a wrecking ball, a heavy weight on a cable that is swung by a crane into the side of the buildings. Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods. Newer methods may use rotational hydraulic shears and silenced rock-breakers attached to excavators to cut or break through wood, steel, and concrete. The use of shears is especially common when flame cutting would be dangerous. The tallest planned demolition of a building was the 47-story Singer Building in New York City, which was built in 1908 and torn down in 1967–1968 to be replaced by One Liberty Plaza. The even taller 270 Park Avenue is now in the process of demolition.  Manual  A wrecking ball in action at the demolition of the Rockwell Gardens. House destroyed by an excavator in Invermere, British Columbia. high-reach excavator is used to demolish this tower block. Demolition of a hotel in southern England. Before any demolition activities can take place, there are many steps that must be carried out beforehand, including performing asbestos abatement, removing hazardous or regulated materials, obtaining necessary permits, submitting necessary notifications, disconnecting utilities, rodent baiting and the development of site-specific safety and work plans. The typical razing of a building is accomplished as follows: *Hydraulic excavators may be used to topple one- or two-story buildings by an undermining process. The strategy is to undermine the building while controlling the manner and direction in which it falls. *The demolition project manager/supervisor will determine where undermining is necessary so that a building is pulled in the desired manner and direction. *The walls are typically undermined at a building's base, but this is not always the case if the building design dictates otherwise. Safety and cleanup considerations are also taken into account in determining how the building is undermined and ultimately demolished. In some cases a crane with a wrecking ball is used to demolish the structure down to a certain manageable height. At that point undermining takes place as described above. However crane mounted demolition balls are rarely used within demolition due to the uncontrollable nature of the swinging ball and the safety implications associated. High reach demolition excavators are more often used for tall buildings where explosive demolition is not appropriate or possible. Excavators with shear attachments are typically used to dismantle steel structural elements. Hydraulic hammers are often used for concrete structures and concrete processing attachments are used to crush concrete to a manageable size, and to remove reinforcing steel. For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive nor high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the \\"inside-out\\" method is used, whereby remotely operated mini- excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished. To control dust, fire hoses are used to maintain a wet demolition. Hoses may be held by workers, secured in fixed location, or attached to lifts to gain elevation. Loaders or bulldozers may also be used to demolish a building. They are typically equipped with \\"rakes\\" (thick pieces of steel that could be an I-beam or tube) that are used to ram building walls. Skid loaders and loaders will also be used to take materials out and sort steel. The technique of Vérinage is used in France to weaken and buckle the supports of central floors promoting the collapse of the top part of a building onto the bottom resulting in a rapid, symmetrical, collapse. The Japanese company Kajima Construction has developed a new method of demolishing buildings which involves using computer-controlled hydraulic jacks to support the bottom floor as the supporting columns are removed. The floor is lowered and this process is repeated for each floor. This technique is safer and more environmentally friendly, and is useful in areas of high population density. To demolish bridges, hoe rams are typically used to remove the concrete road deck and piers, while hydraulic shears are used to remove the bridge's structural steel. Bridge demolition using explosives near Nieuwersluis, The Netherlands, 1920-1940 Fred Dibnah used a manual method of demolition to remove industrial chimneys in Great Britain. He cut an ingress at the base of the chimney—supporting the brickwork with wooden props—and then burning away the props so that the chimney fell, using no explosives and usually hand-operated power tools.  Building implosion  Demolition of a chimney at the former brewery \\"Henninger\\" in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, on 2 December 2006 The demolition of the New Haven Coliseum in New Haven, Connecticut Large buildings, tall chimneys, smokestacks, bridges, and increasingly some smaller structures may be destroyed by building implosion using explosives. Imploding a structure is very fast—the collapse itself only takes seconds—and an expert can ensure that the structure falls into its own footprint, so as not to damage neighboring structures. This is essential for tall structures in dense urban areas. Any error can be disastrous, however, and some demolitions have failed, severely damaging neighboring structures. One significant danger is from flying debris, which, when improperly prepared for, can kill onlookers. Another dangerous scenario is the partial failure of an attempted implosion. When a building fails to collapse completely the structure may be unstable, tilting at a dangerous angle, and filled with un-detonated but still primed explosives, making it difficult for workers to approach safely. A third danger comes from air overpressure that occurs during the implosion. If the sky is clear, the shock wave, a wave of energy and sound, travels upwards and disperses, but if cloud coverage is low, the shock wave can travel outwards, breaking windows or causing other damage to surrounding buildings. Stephanie Kegley of CST Environmental described shock waves by saying, \\"The shock wave is like a water hose. If you put your hand in front of the water as it comes out, it fans to all sides. When cloud coverage is below 1,200 feet, it reacts like the hand in front of the hose. The wave from the shock fans out instead of up toward the sky.\\" Controlled implosion, being spectacular, is the method that the general public often thinks of when discussing demolition; however, it can be dangerous and is only used as a last resort when other methods are impractical or too costly. The destruction of large buildings has become increasingly common as the massive housing projects of the 1960s and 1970s are being leveled around the world. At and , the J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition is the tallest steel framed building and largest single structure ever imploded. = Preparation = It takes several weeks or months to prepare a building for implosion. All items of value, such as copper wiring, are stripped from a building. Some materials must be removed, such as glass that can form deadly projectiles, and insulation that can scatter over a wide area. Non-load bearing partitions and drywall are removed. Selected columns on floors where explosives will be set are drilled and high explosives such as nitroglycerin, TNT, RDX, or C4 are placed in the holes. Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in detonating cord. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a progressive collapse, and therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer due to fewer explosives, and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick geotextile fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris. Far more time- consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.  Deconstruction  An alternative approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to landfills. This \\"green\\" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or recycling. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the CO2 emissions of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition. The development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of demolition waste types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete. Timber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as MDF or chipboard. Safety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.

The home is sometimes mistakenly referred to as \\"Dower House\\" because a small dower house exists on the property. A \\"dower\\" is a widow's share for life of her husband's estate, so a dower house is where a widowed mother would live when her son and his family inherited and moved into the main house. The foundation of the original house was found using ground penetrating radar to the west of the existing structure. The center portion of the existing house is the oldest; dendrochronology revealed that the trees for the wood in that portion of the house were felled the winter of 1827–1828. Dendrochronology also revealed that the large granite section of the house to the west was added in 1841. The east section was added in 1960 by owner John M. DeBoy. While the house looks wide from the street, it is only one room deep. Outbuildings include a smoke house, a carriage house, and the stone \\"Dower House\\" which may have been built in the early 1830s to serve as a summer kitchen. Bethesda rests on a collection of surveyed properties totaling 1000 acres named \\"Long Reach\\", \\"Chews Resolution Manor\\", \\"Search Enlarged\\", \\"Search\\", and \\"Dorsey's Search\\" (448 Acres). The land grant was given to Maj Edward Dorsey (1646–1705) in 1682. When Edward Dorsey died, he willed the land to his nephew, Caleb Dorsey of \\"Belmont\\" in Elkridge, Maryland. Caleb gave the land to his daughter, Mary, when she married Michael Pue, an Irish doctor. They are the first people known to live on the property, and they lived there in 1790 when the newly formed United States of America conducted its first tax assessment. In 1769, the \\"Bethesda Old Place Farm\\" home was expanded on the property and run as a tobacco-producing plantation with 26 slave workers. Two successive generations of Pues also lived there. The property was struck by a tornado in 1858, and stayed in the Pue family until 1859. It was purchased by Thomas Lishear, a sea captain. He had three daughters who never married, and they lived in the house until their deaths. The house was later owned by Dr. George B. Sybert. By 1943, the property had been subdivided to 237 remaining acres. In 1954, the Columbia Hills Corporation developed the land leaving just 8.3 acres surrounding the house. By 1965, the land was subdivided down to three acres. Howard Research and Development purchased most of the original Long Reach property between 1963 and 1966 for the development of Columbia.

She takes a liking towards Tor and after some time she becomes his duo. She is from a village named Gimlé in Scandinavia. Her Blaze is a Sword Type, known as Twin Blades. The reason she came to Japan and enrolled to Koryo Academy is that she wants to get stronger to avenge her family's death; the scar on her back serves as a reminder of the incident.

She later falls in love with Toru, and declares he will be her future husband and win his heart. Though she is officially enrolled in Koryo Academy, she never attends class claiming that she had already finished her studies a long time ago which is why she prefers loitering around the school garden sipping tea with her confidant Sarah.

Known for an innovative approach to a variety of media, as well as use of traditional oil paints, Hack began working in the late 1940s. Early life and education Hack was born July 6, 1932, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and moved with his family to Oakland, California, in 1939. As a youth, Hack established himself among San Francisco’s North Beach artists, exhibiting paintings at Vesuvio Cafe and The Coffee Gallery. Between 1950-1953, Hack learned Flemish techniques from Martin Baer, who had studied in Munich and Paris. Hack attended California College of Arts and Crafts and the San Francisco Art Institute in this period, as well as studying with Yasuo Kuniyoshi at Mills College in the summer of 1949. In 1953, Hack was drafted into the U.S. Army and assigned to Korea where he served as a truck driver and battalion clerk-typist (S-1). Career Upon returning to the U.S., Hack resumed painting, using images from his stay in Korea, and scenes from Oakland. Hack occupied studio space and lived in the Spreckels Mansion, also known as the Ghost House (1150 Franklin Street, San Francisco), along with other artists, including Wally Hedrick, Jay DeFeo, and Hayward King. From the Ghost House Hack attended the gathering at the nearby Six Gallery (the Six Gallery Reading at 3119 Fillmore Street, San Francisco), where poet Alan Ginsberg debuted his poem Howl on October 7, 1955. Between 1957 and 1959, Hack lived primarily in San Miguel de Allende, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, a haven adopted by American artists and bohemians after WWII. In 1959, Hack returned to the United States, enrolling as a philosophy undergraduate at the University of San Francisco. At USF Hack studied the theories of the neo-Kantian idealist philosopher Ernst Cassirer (1874-1945), in particular his concepts of symbolism. =The Audiffred Building= In 1959, after a referral by Beat poet and bookstore owner Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Hack rented studio space with other artists on the third floor of the Audiffred Building located at 9 Mission Street in San Francisco. The artists included Frank Lobdell, Hassel Smith, Sonia Gechtoff, Madeline Dimond, Philip Roeber, Manuel Neri, and Joan Brown. Despite eviction efforts mounted in 1971, Hack alone used this studio space until 1978, completing some of his most notable oil paintings and silverpoints. In 2013, Hack donated the door from his Audiffred studio (salvaged in 1978), signed by artists who had worked on the premises, to the Beat Museum in San Francisco’s North Beach. =Major exhibitions= \\"Window Series #21,\\" 1967, F. Uri & Co., San Francisco MOMA Collection In 1967, the M.H. De Young Museum, San Francisco, exhibited Hack’s “Window Series,” oil paintings depicting scenes from San Francisco’s South of Market area designated for demolition. In his review of the show San Francisco Chronicle art critic Alfred Frankenstein referred to the works as “magic realism,” a phrase coined in 1943 by Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the New York Museum of Modern Art. (In her “Foreword and Acknowledgment” to the MoMA catalog for the exhibition Realists and Magic Realism, Dorothy Canning Miller referred to Barr’s definition of magic realism as “a term sometimes applied to painters who by means of an exact realistic technique try to make plausible and convincing their improbable dreamlike or fantastic visions.”) Frankenstein noted: “Hack has lived for a long time with the moods of windows…. (T)hey display for him the humble machinery of everyday living - shoemaker’s equipment, the chairs and cabinets of a barber shop, a tailor’s padded pressing iron – always silent, always at rest, intensified to the highest degree by isolation and close scrutiny. But his collection of Sunday morning glimpses into little offbeat shops is neither a social document, in the manner of Edward Hopper, nor a celebration of the mechanized, in the style of Charles Sheeler. It is a document of Howard Hack’s perceptions, reactions, and experiments.”Frankenstein, Alfred, Howard Hack, The Window Series: An Exhibition organized by the M.H. De Young Memorial Museum and Gump's Gallery, San Francisco, p. 3 (1967). In 1981, the California Palace of the Legion of Honor presented a collection of works in silverpoint by Howard Hack. The show’s catalog curator Robert Flynn Johnson wrote: “What will people think of Howard Hack’s art one hundred years from now? What will they think of the time, patience and concentration necessary to create these works? What will they think of his seductive style and idiosyncratic subject matter? I believe that Howard Hack’s art will age far more gracefully than the strained and artistic fashions that currently strut upon the stage of history. Time will tell.”Johnson, Robert Flynn, Howard Hack, Silverpoint Drawing Series: 1967 - 1981, An Exhibition organized by the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, p. 6 (1981). In San Francisco, Howard Hack was represented by several galleries, including Richard Gump’s and John Bolles. In New York, Hack’s works were sold through Lee Nordness Gallery. His studio was left abandoned for more than 15 years, but sold in 2016 for 1.5 million dollars despite decrepit conditions.

The third African American ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Church of the United States, he established the first African-American congregation south of the Mason–Dixon line, and worked to educate African American youth.Phyllis L. Chandler, Heritage of Hope and Sacrifice: The Remarkable Journeys of Rev. William Levington (Westminster, Maryland: Willow Bend Books, 2002) Early life Born in New York City, by the time he was seven, Levington was living in Philadelphia and working in the bookstore of Sheldon Potter, along with Alonzo Potter, Sheldon's brother who later became Bishop of Pennsylvania (in 1845). In 1818, Alonzo Potter graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York and began a teaching career there the following year. Levington wanted to study for the ministry and studied under Potter's tutelage until 1822, when Levington returned to Philadelphia to prepare for ordination under the guidance of Rev. Jackson Kemper, assistant to bishop William White. During at least his last years with Alonzo Potter, Levington lived and taught at a school for African American children in Albany. However, New York's Bishop John Henry Hobart refused to ordain him, despite having ordained Rev. Peter Williams Jr., likewise an African American, in 1819. Williams had become an abolitionist in addition to leading St. Philip's Episcopal Church, which had been founded by African American members of historic Trinity Church, Hobart's New York parish before becoming bishop.http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/waller_statement1898.html Levington likewise delivered addresses against slavery, including through the Ladies Philanthropic Benezet society, though that did not prevent Albany's mayor and others from providing glowing references upon his departure.Chandler pp. 1-7 Ministry Bishop William White ordained Levington as a deacon at the Church of St. Thomas on March 14, 1824, three decades after ordaining Rev. Absalom Jones at the same church, and six years after Jones' death.Bragg at p. 10 However, Levington was not to remain with that congregation. Instead, Kemper wrote a letter of recommendation praising his conduct and piety, which led to an interview with Bishop James Kemp in Baltimore. On June 23, 1824, the new missionary established the St. James First African Protestant Episcopal Church and school in an upstairs room of a building at Marion and Park Avenues in Baltimore. At the time, Maryland law prohibited African American children from attending public schools, though they paid taxes. 200px The next year, lawyer James Bosley donated land to build a church for the new congregation, and George Whipple donated five thousand bricks, which with other financial donations enabled the congregation to build a new church at North (later renamed Guilford Avenue) and Saratoga Streets. Bishop Kemp consecrated the new building on March 23, 1827, and Levington's friend (and future bishop) Rev. John Prentiss Kewley Henshaw of St. Peter's Church delivered the first sermon. Since Bishop Kemp died unexpectedly in October after a coach accident, Levington returned to Philadelphia's St. Thomas Church, and Bishop White ordained him as a priest on March 23, 1828. After some controversy during which Levington insisted that enslaved and free members of the congregation would receive the same rights, the new church was formally incorporated by Maryland's legislature in 1829. However, for several years Levington needed to travel through several northern states to raise sufficient money to keep the new church operating, pay the construction debt and fund his own salary, since the Episcopal church as a whole did not fund missionaries at the time.Bragg pp. 14-16 Levington also spoke out against both slavery and the American Colonization Society, despite his donor Whipple's being the society's agent in Baltimore. In 1835, Levington signed a letter (along with Rev. John Fortie of the Sharp Street Methodist Episcopal Church and Rev. Nathaniel Peck of the Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church), which African American teacher and activist William Watkins thought was too conciliatory.Chandler pp. 47-49Hillary J. Moss, Schooling Citizens: The Struggle for African American Education in Antebellum America (University of Chicago Press, 2010) p. 113-114, 195, Death and legacy Levington died of bilious pleurisy on May 15, 1836, and was buried in Old Bethel African Cemetery, with his friend Henshaw paying the burial expenses. His successor was Rev. Joshua Peterkin, a recent white graduate of Virginia Theological Seminary, who soon left the mission congregation, as did several other pastors until George Freeman Bragg, who wrote and published a biography of his predecessor. St. James Church relocated twice under Bragg, including to its current location across from Baltimore's Lafayette Square, which continues to display a memorial marker honoring its founder. William Douglass, who graduated from the St. James school and had become a Methodist minister, was ordained an Episcopal deacon at St. Stephen's Church in Cecil County, Maryland on June 22, 1834, and moved to Philadelphia to take charge of St. Thomas Church, where he was ordained a priest by Bishop Henry Onderdonk on February 14, 1836. He became that historic black parish's second rector (after Absalom Jones) and served until his death in 1862.Bragg pp. 17-19 Levington also taught the mother of A.M.E. Bishop Levi Coppin, husband of missionary and teacher Fanny Jackson Coppin, for whom Maryland's Coppin State University was later named.

Tade holds the record for number of consecutive participations in the FIFA Club World Cup, appearing for Auckland City at seven consecutive FIFA Club World Cup tournaments from 2011 to 2017. He is currently the all-time leading goal scorer for Auckland City, as well as the all-time leading goal scorer in New Zealand Football Championship history; his exploits earned him a professional move to South Africa, eventually signing for league champions Mamelodi Sundowns in 2019. Career =Early career= Born in Santiago del Estero, Tade grew up playing for boyhood side Club Atlético Mitre. Instead of pursuing a career in football, Tade was studying to become a lawyer before moving to New Zealand in April 2010. After Martín Pereyra, a fellow Argentine playing in New Zealand, suggested he trial for local semi-pro side Wellington United, Tade began a club football career. Tade's performances in the Central Premier League impressed impressed Team Wellington head coach Stu Jacobs, and Tade signed for the ASB Premiership club prior to the 2010–11 season, scoring six goals in 16 appearances in his debut season in the New Zealand top flight. =Auckland City= The next season, Tade sealed a move to Auckland City, joining a Hispanic contingent that included Andreu Guerao, Manel Expósito, Albert Riera, Ángel Berlanga and Luis Corrales. Tade won the golden boot in both the 2013–14 ASB Premiership and 2013–14 OFC Champions League. He also won his first league championship that season, scoring the only goal in the final as Auckland City beat former club Team Wellington on 16 March 2014. Due to Auckland City's dominance in the OFC Champions League, winning the competition for seven straight seasons, Tade appeared at a record seven consecutive FIFA Club World Cup competitions between 2011 and 2017. This included Auckland City's historic run in the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, falling to Argentine giants San Lorenzo in the semifinal, before defeating Cruz Azul in the third- place playoff. His performances in the tournament earned him a move to Torneo Federal A side Club Atlético Mitre ahead of the 2015 season; however, he lasted less than a season before returning to Auckland. =South Africa= AmaZulu On 26 May 2018, Tade confirmed that he had completed a move to Absa Premiership club AmaZulu FC following a successful trial. Tade made his debut for Usuthu in a 1−0 win over Baroka FC on 4 August 2018. He quickly began to impress during his time in South Africa, forming a strong partnership with Bongi Ntuli and becoming widely regarded as one of the most dangerous forwards in the league. After a productive first half of the season where Tade scored seven goals in all competitions and won Player of the Month honours for November and December, he drew interest from the league's larger clubs. Mamelodi Sundowns On 31 January 2019, reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns announced the signing of Emiliano Tade for an undisclosed fee - believed to be around 6 million rand - which also included the permanent transfer of Bongi Ntuli, previously on loan to AmaZulu, in the other direction. Mamelodi went on to win the title that season, with Tade contributing two goals in 12 appearances for Sundowns. His next season in South Africa was plagued by injury and personal issues; Tade failed to make an appearance for Sundowns, and eventually requested a release from his contract, citing constant injury struggles, homesickness and a wish to cease playing professionally. Tade agreed a mutual termination of contract, and he was officially released on 11 December 2019, returning to his family in New Zealand. =Return to Auckland City= On 13 January 2020, Auckland City confirmed that Tade had returned to the club alongside Tom Doyle.

The formation is based in Tokyo and is currently composed of Hamasaki Yoko alias Yokotan (vocals), Matsunaga Temma alias Tenma (vocals), Zeze Shin alias Shinsama (guitar), the drummer Kagiyama Kyoichi alias Kyouchan left the band and they are now looking for a new drummer. Yachimura Kei alias Yashi (keyboard) was also part of the band in its earlier stages. Urbangarde's music is characterized by its blend of electronic, pop, rock and various other musical styles. The mix of male and female vocals from Matsunaga Temma and Hamasaki Yoko often speak of social issues in Japan such as the high suicide rate, teen prostitution, teen pregnancy, death and disease. Urbangarde's lyrics and music videos have a reputation of sometimes being shocking and thought-provoking. The name of the band is a mix of the word \\"urban\\" and part of the French expression \\"avant- garde\\" which means experimental or innovative.  Style and influences  Urbangarde's musical styles varie from bubblegum pop to 80s style synthpop, punk, progressive rock, chiptune, new wave, goth, industrial and heavy metal. The members of the band sometimes define what they do as \\"Tokyo Virginity Pop\\" or \\"Trauma Techno Pop\\". The use of visual arts to support their music and ideas is a large part of their act, with performance art, otome (virginal) and Lolita fashion. They have also been known to sometimes read poetry in live shows. Tenma is responsible for the artistic aspects of the band and notably writes the lyrics, takes care of the general design of the band's image, promotional videos and music videos. Their numerous music videos often incorporate disturbing imagery such as blood, weapons, representations of suicide and a giant Kewpie doll that is often present in live performances as well. According to Matsunaga Temma, the doll represents a baby created by modern society. Red and white polka dots and sailor school uniforms are often used as an icon of Urbangarde. Temma said, \\"There’s a “shoujo (girl)” religion unique to Japan which has the sailor uniform and straight black hair as its icons, and you can’t separate those from sexuality and gender. In Japan’s case, it’s not only the demand from the male side, but also the female side has the desire to be young and to remain as a girl.\\" It is cited on their official website that the band represents the \\"minority of underground cultures, virgins and otakus\\". For these reasons, their success grew heavily on the internet. Hamasaki Yoko and Matsunaga Temma said in a PXLBBQ interview in France that Serge Gainsbourg is one of their influences. Technopop from the 80s is also a big inspiration for Matsunaga Temma.  History  Yokotan from Urbangarde performing live at Toulouse Game Show in 2012 Urbangarde was created by lyricist, poet and man of the theatre Matsunaga Temma after meeting Hamasaki Yoko, who then sang old French songs. After seeing one of her performances, Matsunaga Temma recognized her talent and decided to make her the lead singer of the band. They started to significantly rise in popularity in 2007 after having passed the audition for Yahoo! Japan ・WHO’S NEXT and making it in the top 5 in over 3000 bands. After the release of the first three indie albums, their major debut singles \\"Skirt Kakumei\\" and \\"Tokimeki ni Shisu\\" were released under Universal Music Japan in 2011. The following album \\"Mental Hells\\" was their first major label album release. They then started performing for crowds of over 1000 in Tokyo and their 2012 album \\"Geiger Counter Culture\\" reached position number 10 on the daily Oricon chart in Japan and made the top 25 on its weekly chart. The album was a reflection on the post-Fukushima era in Japan. In an interview by Daniel Robson from noisy.vice.com, Tenma said ; «[...] after the earthquake there has been a lot to get pissed off about in Japanese politics, and now we feel like we have a message to get across.» Urbangarde also participated in several seasons of the TV program Japan in Motion (NOLIFE TV), which eventually led them to perform live at the Toulouse Game Show in December 2012. Since then, the band has an ever growing fanbase in France. The band also performed at Paris' anime mega-fest Japan Expo in July 2013 and then released their greatest hits compilation \\"Koi to Kakumei to URBANGARDE\\" featuring their new opus \\"Tokai no Alice\\". Urbangarde's new album \\"Utsukushii Kuni\\" came out in June 2014. The title \\"Utsukushii Kuni\\" (Beautiful Country) is actually a play on words. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, used the phrase as a title of his book and in a political speech during his first term. Urbangarde intentionally used the wrong Chinese character 鬱(utsu=depression) instead of 美しい(utsukushii=beautiful). The album features artwork by Makoto Aida, a contemporary Japanese painter renowned for his provocative works of manga, painting, video, photography and sculpture.

Faraz Talat of Dawn praised the acting of Adnan Siddiqui, Sana Bucha and Ayub Khoso, but said the movie suffered from an incoherent storyline, in addition to weaknesses in choreography, dialogues, production, and certain aspects of character development. While noting Yalghaar's expensive production value, he concluded that the \\"film industry needs more than just patriotism; it needs a will to explore new artistic territory.\\" Sana Gilani of Daily Pakistan called Yalghaar \\"one of the most promising movies of [the] year\\" and viewed all characters positively, save for the female extras and the antagonist role played by Humayun Saeed, which she described as \\"aloof\\". According to Gilani, critics appeared to miss the fact that the movie relayed true events, which made the storyline and narrative obvious. Omair Alavi of Brandsynario commended Yalghaar as a \\"better option\\" for those wanting to watch a Pakistani film, and approved its action sequences, patriotic and emotion-laced appeal, war theme, as well as its cast which featured renowned and upcoming stars. However, he noted there were certain technical glitches, ordinarily executed scenes, and misplaced dialogues.

The expected daily ridership is estimated at 350,000 with a total of 109 km of dedicated bus routes Upon completion, it will become the largest metro bus network in Pakistan after Lahore Metro system. The Karachi Metrobus project was inaugurated on 25 February 2016 and was slated to begin operation by February 2017. Nawaz Sharif, during a high-level meeting in Karachi on July 10, 2014, announced to provide infrastructure component to launch the BRT Green Line project on modern lines to alleviate the severe traffic congestion in the city. The slow pace of work on BRT Green Line has irked citizens as the digging work on main arteries has resulted in congestion of traffic. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif declared Sindh government responsible for the delay in Green Line Bus Rapid Transit System in Karachi. Lines The system will be divided into 5 dedicated lines or \\"busways\\". =Green Line= The Green Line will extend from Merewether Tower to Surjani Town at a total length of . The Government of Pakistan will be financing the majority of the project. Construction of the Green Line began on February 26, 2016. The line will have 22 bus stations when completed. Engineering Associates have been contracted as the designers and supervision consultants for Green Line while a Consortium of \\"Ernest & Young\\", \\"Exponent Engineers\\" & \\"Haider Mota & BNR\\" have been contracted for \\"Transaction Advisory for Bus Operational Plan\\". The government is in process of acquiring 80 units of 18-metre-long buses. In addition, a Command and Control Centre is being established at the Garden West. In October 2016, the CDWP revised the cost of Karachi metro bus project upwards by 52% to Rs 24.6 billion in addition to approving changes in its design. In December 2014, the Ecnec had approved the mass transit project at a cost of Rs16.1 billion after it cut the length of the route by 3.2 km. However, the provincial government expressed concerns and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced to extend the scope and length of the project. =Orange Line= The Orange Line is the smallest of the five line's spreading over 3.9 km with only four stations. The Orange line will be spread over 2.3 km, of which 0.7 km will be elevated while 1.5 km will be on ground, whereas, the 1.5 km will be semi dedicated section. This project would be constructed in two phases and is likely to completed by 2017. The line will have the capacity to carry up to 50,000 passengers daily with a station after every kilometer. The line begins from Shaharh-e-Quaideen near TMO Office Orangi to Board Office, where it will join the Green Line BRT, through a rotary flyover. The project, worth Rs. 2 billion, is entirely funded by the Sindh government. In March 2017, the foundation stone of the second phase as well as of the depot was laid which would complete by July 2017. The depot would have the capacity for the parking of 35 buses. =Blue Line= The Blue Line will extend from Merewether Tower to Bahria Town at a total length of . It will be the first privately funded transport system in Pakistan being funded by the Bahria Town Group.http://bahriatowntoday.com/bahria-town- karachi-to-start-bus-rapid-transit-system-brts/ At the moment the Blue Line is undergoing preliminary design with construction likely to begin in the first quarter of 2017. =Yellow Line= The 26.5-kilometre-long Yellow Line project — from Landhi to New M.A. Jinnah road — is to be built with an estimated cost of Rs.14.4 billion with 104 new buses on the route. In October 2017, the World Bank agreed to provide financial and technical support for the construction of the Yellow Line BRT in Karachi and the establishment of an integrated BRT system. =Red Line= The Red Line has been approved and will extend from Model Colony to Regal Chowk Via Safoora Goth and University Road at a total length of . The project is estimated at $184.23 million where ADB, DFID (UK) and Sindh would share at a rate of 52 percent, 12.62 percent and 34.42 percent respectively.https://arynews.tv/en/asian-development-bank-agrees-to-finance- red-line-brt-project-in-karachi/ Fleet The government is in the process of acquiring 80 18-meter-long articulated buses for the Green Line, 25 18-meter- long articulated buses for the Green Line Extension and 18 12-meter-long buses for the Orange Line.

The Division 1 premiership was won by the Sandringham Football Club, after it defeated Williamstown in the Grand Final on 22 September by six points; it was Sandringham's third Division 1 premiership, and its first since 1962. The Division 2 premiership was won by Brunswick; it was the club's third Division 2 premiership, and the last premiership in either division ever won by the club. Association membership During the off-season, the Association's second division contracted from eleven to ten clubs, with Kilsyth leaving the Association. Northcote also temporarily left the Association, but returned prior to the start of the season. ;Northcote On 28 November 1984, the Northcote Football Club, one of the Association's longest-serving clubs, announced that it was withdrawing from the Association due to financial pressures. Northcote estimated its annual expenses to compete in Division 2 had increased to $85,000, including $16,000 affiliation costs. The club saw that increasing administrative costs, and upward pressure on player payments which had flowed on from a similar trend in the increasingly professional Victorian Football League had increased its expenses, but that the small and increasingly apathetic population of Northcote was no longer able to finance the club. Despite its departure, the club described its financial position as no worse than many other Association clubs, and predicted that other clubs would soon leave the Association for the same reason. Two weeks later, the club joined the Diamond Valley Football League, which it estimated had half of the operating costs of the Association. Over the following two months, five past players keen to keep the club in the Association – Arthur Dearing, Ken Harvey, Chris Kozaris, Tom Martin and Dennis Viney – were voted to the Northcote executive committee. The new committee secured readmission to the Association on 12 February 1985. The new committee worked to cover the club's $18,000 debt by seeking new sponsors and attempting to form a coterie group. Additionally, the club gained some revenue from the League's Fitzroy Football Club, which had arranged a deal to train at Northcote Park (while playing home games at Victoria Park, Abbotsford), after having been evicted from the Junction Oval during the summer. ;Kilsyth The Kilsyth Football Club, which had competed in Division 2 for the previous three years with very little success, withdrew from the Association shortly before the season. As had been the case for Northcote, the club struggled with low revenue and high operating costs, and the club had considered leaving prior to the 1984 season for the same reason. As late as February, the club still intended to contest the 1985 season and had been included in the fixture, and it tried hard to attract strong local players from the Eastern District Football League to compile a competitive playing list; but it did not succeed, and withdrew from the competition before the season began. It returned to the EDFL in 1986 and remains there as of 2020. ;Association structure Four years after expanding the size of Division 1 to twelve teams, the Association decided during the season that the top division would be contracted back to ten teams from the 1986 season. As a consequence, it was determined that the 1985 Division 2 premiers would still earn promotion to Division 1, and that the bottom three from Division 1 would all be relegated. Division 1 The Division 1 home-and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page–McIntyre system. The finals were played at the Junction Oval. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the season was Ian Morrison (Sandringham), who kicked 105 goals during the home-and-away season, and 108 goals overall. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won by Neil MacLeod (Sandringham), who polled 22 votes. MacLeod finished ahead of Ross Gallagher (Sandringham) who polled 16 votes, and Brett Chadband (Port Melbourne), who polled 14 votes. *Preston won the seconds premiership for the third consecutive season. Preston 21.17 (143) defeated Coburg 14.14 (98) in the Grand Final, held on Sunday 22 September at North Port Oval. Division 2 The Division 2 home-and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page–McIntyre system. The finals were played at Junction Oval. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for Division 2 was Rino Pretto (Oakleigh), who kicked 149 goals in the home-and-away season, and 170 goals overall. Pretto's total was the highest in a season by any player since Ron Todd kicked 188 goals in 1945 during the throw-pass era; it set and, as of 2019, holds the record for most goals in a season outside the throw-pass era. *The J. Field Medal was won by Darren Hall (Dandenong). Hall finished ahead of Greg Packham (Caulfield), who was second, and Glenn Scanlan (Sunshine), who was third. *Brunswick won the Seconds premiership for the third consecutive season. Brunswick 17.17 (119) defeated Waverley 14.11 (95) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the Division 1 Seconds Grand Final on 22 September at North Port Oval. Notable events =Interleague matches= The Association played one interleague match during the season, against the Victorian Amateur Football Association. Gary Brice (who had returned Port Melbourne after a season at League club ) continued as Association coach; David Brine (Preston) was captain. The Association no longer fielded a separate Division 2 representative team. =Other notable events= *In December 1984, Alan Wickes, who had served as Association president since March 1981, declined to stand for re-election. Former Brunswick president and Brunswick and Camberwell player Brook Andersen was elected to the office in his place. *The Association's order-off rule, which had been introduced in 1980, was amended in 1985. Under the original rule, the team played one short during the period that a player was ordered off the ground; but under the amended rule, the ordered off player could be replaced, meaning that the teams continued to play sixteen-a-side during the penalty. *Berwick moved its home ground from Arch Brown Reserve to the Manuka Road Oval in 1985, following a clubhouse fire during the summer. *Moorabbin moved from the McKinnon Recreation Reserve to the Bentleigh Recreation Reserve, its third home ground in three years. *Camberwell endured significant financial hardship during the season. Despite having already asked its players to take a pay cut at the start of the season, the club remained unable to make its payments; in mid-June, led by one-time Association leading goalkicker Peter Stevenson and other key senior players Mark Turner and Robert Wilkinson, players began to walk out on the club. Within a year, more than forty players had walked out on the club, resulting in the club – which had played finals in 1984 – falling to a winless season in 1986. *Oakleigh also endured financial difficulties during the year, and, with their consent, did not pay its players during the season. *On 23 June, Williamstown 17.11 (113) defeated Preston 15.14 (104), ending Preston's club- record 23-match winning streak which dated back to 1984. It was also, quite remarkably, the first time Preston ruckman Neil Jordan had lost a game for the club in any grade across his 84-game career; he had previously played 34 matches for the Thirds, 24 matches for the Seconds, and 25 matches for the Firsts without suffering a defeat. *On 26 July, Oakleigh trailed Sunshine by 43 points early in the final quarter, before coming back to win by one point; Oakleigh 16.13 (109) d. Sunshine 15.18 (108) *As in 1984, Network Ten televised one match in each of the final two weeks of the home-and-away season, followed by all of the Division 1 finals. Because of this, the Association made a decision to swap the Division 1 fixtures of Rounds 15 and 17, because ladder positions at the time indicated that there would be no interesting matches to televise in Round 17; this proved to be a wise move, as the top five teams won their originally scheduled Round 17 matches by an average of 105 points. *Port Melbourne missed the finals in dramatic circumstances after a terrible performance in the final round of the home-and- away season. After Round 17, Port Melbourne sat fourth with a record of 12–5 with a percentage of 140.8, which was a substantial advantage over fifth- placed Williamstown with a record of 11–6 and a percentage of 133.1. In Round 18, Port Melbourne lost more than nine percentage points in a heavy televised loss against second-placed Coburg, Coburg 21.15 (141) d. Port Melbourne 5.9 (39); this allowed Williamstown to qualify with a comfortable win against sixth-placed Geelong West, Williamstown 14.16 (100) d. Geelong West 8.10 (58). *Starting from this year, the Association played the Division 1 and Division 2 finals on the same days as double-headers at the Junction Oval, with the Division 2 matches serving as curtain-raisers to the Division 1 matches; this ended the long-standing practice of playing the Division 2 finals at a different venue (usually Toorak Park) and a week or two earlier than the corresponding Division 1 finals. The Seconds finals for both divisions, which had previously served as curtain-raisers to the Firsts finals, were played as double-headers at North Port Oval. Under this arrangement, Network Ten televised the final quarter of the Division 2 final before broadcasting the entire Division 1 match. *In the Division 1 Grand Final, Williamstown selected fourteen-year-old Ron James to play his first senior game.

The species is endemic to Australia. Habitat Like other Cacophis species, the golden-crowned snake is a forest specialist, particularly rainforest. It prefers deeper forested areas, particularly rainforest on mountain slopes, however it can show up in suburbs near waterways and moist environments with ground cover and shelter.Wilson, Steve; Swan, Gerry (2013). A Complete Guide to Reptiles of Australia, Fourth Edition. (2013). Sydney: New Holland Publishers. 522 pp. . Venom Cacophis squamulosus is only mildly venomous, however it will bluff and mock bite if threatened, rearing into an S-shape to display the bright orange ventral pigmentation. Bites from larger individuals may present a health risk, however it is more likely to attempt to intimidate those it feels threatened by. Diet The diet of the golden-crowned snake consists mostly of skinks and other small lizards which they hunt at night; they may also take frogs and tadpoles. Geographic range Cacophis squamulosus is localised to eastern Australia, from Canberra, ACT, to Cairns, QLD. Description The average total length (including tail) of C. squamulosus is , but it may reach , making it the largest of the crowned snakes. The golden-crowned snake has a dorsal surface grayish-brown to dark brown in colour, and a ventral surface of orange to pink, with a mid-line of black spots. The \\"crown\\" is a pale yellow-brown stripe starting at the snout and sweeping back along both sides of the head, not connecting at the back of the head as in C. krefftii or C. harriettae, instead trailing down the neck. The Dorsal scales are in 15 rows at mid-body. Reproduction Cacophis squamulosus is oviparous. References Further reading *Cogger HG (2014). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, Seventh Edition.

The film tells the story of an imprisoned man (played by Méliès himself) who turns out to be the Devil in disguise. Plot The film features Méliès in a room which is intended to be a cell and he finds ways to cure his boredom by performing tricks, such as vanishing and magically appearing picture frames and sudden appearing fireplaces and dinner tables with wine. Towards the end of the film he appears as Satan and tricks his guards by disappearing in a blanket. Satan in Prison 3.jpg Satan in Prison 2.jpg Satan in Prison 1.jpg Production and release Méliès, who had begun his performing career as a successful stage magician, often featured the Devil in his films, taking advantage of the character's possibilities as a creator of strange magical happenings. In Satan in Prison, as was his usual practice, Méliès himself appears as the Devil. The film's special effects were created with pyrotechnics and substitution splices. Méliès filmed an expanded version of the same idea, with many of the same props but with more characters and a more elaborate narrative, two years later as The Diabolic Tenant. Satan in Prison was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 1010–1013 in its catalogues.

Early life Mike Stilkey was born in Tarzana, California, and spent his childhood moving from city to city primarily in the Los Angeles area. From age 8 to 14, Stilkey attended a different school each year. Most of his childhood was spent in Malibu Lake, a small town Stilkey describes as a \\"hippy party community\\". The son of addict parents, Stilkey found himself at a very early age immersed in a world of drug culture, parties and a life without discipline. \\"I was allowed to do anything I wanted. There were no rules.\\" In his teenage years, Stilkey picked up skateboarding. He described skateboarding as a retreat away from his dysfunctional family. Stilkey claims his artwork was partly inspired by the spirit of skateboarding which taught him how to take a different perspective on life and living. \\"When people are looking ahead, I'm looking at the details of the curb…looking at different things.\\" Stilkey's dream of becoming a professional skateboarder was crushed at age 20 after a series of injuries. With his injury sidelining him from skateboarding, Stilkey turned to drawing and painting. \\"My family never talked about feelings. I was not allowed to express myself as a kid. Skateboarding was where I let out my emotions, but since I couldn't skate anymore, I picked up a pencil and expressed what was inside…the good, the bad and the unknown. This was the only way I could let it out.\\" Stilkey has described going into a fantasy world while creating art: \\"I was doing drugs, I had addicts for parents and a messed up family. Art saved my life\\". Career Stilkey's first encounter with art came at age 18 with mutual friends that were a part of the AWR and MSK Graffiti crews in Los Angeles. He did not produce graffiti but was influenced by the culture and enjoyed the rebellious spirit of their work. After painting for a few years, working odd jobs, and dealing with a recent suicide attempt by his father, the 24-year-old Stilkey fell into a major depression and had what he called a \\"mental breakdown\\". He donated his car, quit his job and promised himself never to work for anyone ever again. \\"Why would I struggle doing something I hated. I'd rather struggle doing something I love.\\" Within a week, Stilkey met Markus Brandley, the owner of Artpiece gallery in Los Angeles. Brandley was inspired by Stilkey's free spirit and invited him to use Artpiece as a studio space. One of Stilkey's first solo shows at Artpiece was entitled 100 Portraits. Stilkey painted 100 portraits on book pages. 100 Portraits, a limited edition book of the portraits was published. In 2006 gallery owners Jana DesForges and artist Dave Kinsey (original partner with Shepard Fairey) discovered Stilkey's work. Later that year BLK/MRKT invited Stilkey to be a part of a group show. Stilkey debuted his first book sculpture while exhibiting work at BLK/MRKT. > It was sort of an accident. I was painting on book pages for forever. At the > time, I was drawing on books, records or anything else I could find at a > thrift store. Eventually, I started drawing on the books themselves. I was > going to do a project where I just drew on the covers of the books, and as I > finished them I would stack them against the wall. It dawned on me that it > might be a good idea to paint down the spines of the books instead of just > on the covers. The first one I did I didn't really think much of, but I > brought it down to BLK/MRKT, and I remember Jana going crazy over it. We > showed it at the second Artists' Annual group show where it got quite a bit > of attention, including attention from Kim Davenport, the director of Rice > Gallery in Houston. The day after the show, Rice University contacted Stilkey about a large-scale installation. Within the week Stilkey was in Houston and in discussions about creating a piece that would consist of 5,000 books. The exhibition opened in the summer of 2007. Rice University bought the piece, where it is now on permanent display. Since 2007, Stilkey's work has been exhibited throughout the United States as well as internationally, at galleries and museums such as: the Bristol City Museum in the UK, Mesa Contemporary Art Museum in Mesa, Arizona, Bakersfield Museum of Art in Bakersfield, California, the Arne Nixon Center at California State University, Fresno, the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco, the Kinsey/DesForges Gallery in Culver City, California, the David B. Smith Gallery in Denver, the Gilman Contemporary Gallery, Ketchum, Idaho, and LeBasse Projects in Culver City, California. He has also created numerous large-scale installations internationally in: Bordeaux, France; Hong Kong, China; Turin, Italy; Manila, Philippines; and Bern, Switzerland. Stilkey's largest installation entitled Discarded Romance debuted in Hong Kong Times Square in 2012. The 24 foot high by 14 foot wide installation consisting of more than 5,000 books was the centerpiece of a solo show in Hong Kong entitled Full of Smiles and Soft Attentions. This show propelled Stilkey's international profile. Andrew Hosner of Arrested Motion wrote: \\"Stilkey's work features a melancholic and at times whimsical cast of characters, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Weimer-era German expressionism. Inhabiting an ambiguous environment, his subjects convey a lingering sense of loss and longing. Stilkey's work reinvents the canvas to push boundaries between words, visual art and music\\". Jenna Krajeski of The New Yorker wrote: \\"His work on stacked spines and covers reworks books into a beautiful, albeit unreadable, library\\". For the 50th Anniversary of John F. Kennedy's death, the Washington Post commissioned Stilkey to paint a portrait of Kennedy on books that were written about Kennedy. A photo of the portrait garnered the front page of the Washington Post on October 27, 2013. Personal life Stilkey is an avid pool player and can be commonly found in pool tournaments where other contestants only know him by his nickname \\"Red.\\" Stilkey is an animal lover and vegetarian. \\"I love the fact that animals have such strong personalities. In the end we're all the same. We're all alive in this weird place\\". Stilkey lives in a suburb of Los Angeles with his wife and son. His wife Elizabeth has been the inspiration for many of Mike's works. Solo exhibitions * 2014 The Frostig Collection, Santa Monica, California.

With passing time, they meet and fall for each other, before Pappi meets Nandini's father Bharat Chandra and convinces him for his marriage to her in exchange for a promotion. Paapi invites his father Dada, a Kolkata-based criminal, to attend his engagement, while Nandini tells about this to Gautam, who meets Bharat and makes a deal with him: Gautam asks him for his gun and the list of Dada and his gang members so that he can kill them and Bharat can take responsibility for the \\"encounter killings\\". Bharat agrees and Gautam kills his first target Babbar, Dada's right hand. Afraid that Dada might kill Bharat if he takes the responsibility for Babbar's encounter, he decides to announce it publicly after Gautam kills Dada in the future. Following Babbar's death, Pappi's engagement is stopped and he receives a DVD in which terrorists take responsibility for Babbar's murder. He nevertheless decides to marry Nandini within the next 30 days. Gautam and his partner Brahmi are taken hostage by Pappi who makes them stay in their house. Gautam and Nandini conspire to convince Pappi to postpone the marriage, but instead he prepones it and informs Dada about his marriage. Dada scolds him, and tells him that his brother Chotu has arrived in the city and taken Babbar's corpse for forensic tests. Learning this, Gautam and Brahmi wear masks and beat up Chotu, who arrives at Pappi's house and stops the marriage. He then recalls one of the attackers had a tattoo on their right hand but is unable to understand the language it was written in (Telugu). Later, Dr. Kanakarathnam arrives with an image from Babbar's corpse's retina. However, it turns out to be an image of one of the superstars in whose disguise Gautam and Brahmi had beaten up Chotu. It is then revealed that due to being tortured, the doctor had joined hands with Gautam and also erased the tattoo from his hand. Pappi becomes disillusioned by the constant hindrances and decides to call off the wedding. Worried about his deal with Bharat, Gautam introduces a \\"Lungi\\" Baba who tells Pappi that he can marry but first he must invite his father Dada and uncle Chotta. As Chotta arrives, Gauatam attacks and kills him along with his henchmen. Gautam's father, Raghuram sees him kill Chotta, and Gautam tells him that he did it because when had gone to Kolkata to attend his younger brother Ajay's chess competition, his brother won it but got killed by Dada when he was found filming them killing a man. His mother was injured severely by them too and thus admitted to a hospital where she told Gautam to kill Dada and his men, but since he knew nothing about them, he went back to the spot where his brother died and through his phone viewed the recording. Upon finalizing his targets, he met Bharat and made the deal which was actually for revenge. He couldn't tell his father about this fearing he might get shattered. They then go to meet Gautam's mother, following which Dada calls Gautam and tells him he knew about him through a CCTV recording of the spot where Ajay died. Gautam arrives on the spot where Nandini has been held hostage and in the ensuing fight kills Chotu, Dada and many of his henchmen. Brahmi meets and hands over the proof of murders to Bharat, who calls the home minister and tells him he found the killer with proof. Hearing this, Brahmi flees away, while Pappi gathers a few more henchmen and is stopped by Lungi Baba who asks him whether he wants to marry or die. He says he wants to marry, and goes along with him.

In 1864, S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia became the first school to play cricket, mainly against small clubs. In 1876, Royal College Colombo began playing with the arrival of English cricketer Ashley Walker. Sri Lanka's first inter-school match was played between S. Thomas' College and Royal College in 1880, establishing an annual match, popularly known as The Battle of the Blues.  Expansion  Cricket became popular among the people in the colonies of the British Empire.Wikipedia This applied to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) as it was a British colony. Since St. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia and Royal College, Colombo started to play cricket, large schools in Kandy, Galle, Matara and Jaffna also included cricket in their sports programs. Gradually, cricket became one of the entertaining sports wherever it was played in Sri Lanka, and one of the most popular games amongst the public. By this time, the Sri Lankan government realized the importance of developing cricket as a national sport; and as a result various development projects, such as constructing grounds with all necessary infrastructure facilities and encouraging more schools to play cricket by providing necessary funds, as cricket was an expensive game, were undertaken by then governments with a view to making school cricket a nursery for forming a strong national team to represent Sri Lanka at the international level.  Governors of school cricket in Sri Lanka  = Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) = The main body that governed and looked after the cricket in Sri Lanka initially was a board called ‘Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka' (BCCSL). Later on, with full blessings of said governments the BCCSL renamed ‘Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC)’. With the vast development and expansion of school cricket in the country, it became necessary for the main control body (SLC) to have an Association to assist them in activities relevant to school cricket and with this requirement ‘Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) came into existence in the year 1948. = Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) = SLSCA was an idea conceived in the minds of a group of school principals way back in 1930, and the organization was officially formed in 1948 with Rev. J. S. Carter, Principal of Wesley College, Colombo, as its first president. Since then SLSCA has taken full responsibility in decision making, arranging island-wide inter-school tournaments, and appointing office bearers at school level. In Sri Lanka, school cricket is played in a well- organized manner without hampering the other activities of people involved. In most cricket playing countries school cricket is not played competitively and doesn't receive very much recognition at core level; but in Sri Lanka, players are given enough opportunities to expose themselves competitively and as a result the best teams gain due recognition for their hard work. There are hardly any countries in the world where school cricket tournaments from U13 to U19 age groups are coordinated in such a way the SLSCA does it in Sri Lanka and therefore the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association is considered to be one of the best organizations of its type in the world.  Basic inter-school tournaments currently conducted by SLSCA  = Laws & authority = The school cricket tournaments are conducted under the laws of cricket 2000 code 4th edition and ICC playing conditions with special conditions laid down by SLSCA. A tournament committee that is appointed by SLSCA for each tournament has the full authority on all matters relating to the respective tournaments and they do take the responsibility of conducting tournaments with complete control over them. = Eligibility for participation = All SLSCA-affiliated member schools are eligible to take part in tournaments organized and conducted by SLSCA.  Schools and tournament categorization  * Teams of all age groups – Under 19, 17, 15 & 13 are graded as Division 1, 11 & 111 according to the strength of the teams involved in respective age groups. * Tournaments of respective age groups have a fixed duration to complete the tournament in a given year as follows: = U19 – D1, 11 & 111 = * U19 age group of Division 1 and 11 commences its two-day league tournaments in September and goes on until the end of February the following year and Division 111 plays its two-day league matches from September to the end of January of the following year. = U17 & 15 – D1, 11 & 111 = * U17 and U15 limited over tournaments start around May after the completion of the U19 tournaments and continue until August. = U13 – D1, 11 & 111 = * U13 tournaments that commence around September after the completion of U17 & U15 tournaments end in December.

Designed by Thomas Lamb in the Adams style, it opened on August 29, 1921, as part of a sixteen-storey office building for the Loew's Theatres company, with a seating capacity of 3,200 and featuring both vaudeville and films. It was Broadway's first $1 million theatre. It was initially managed by Joseph Vogel, who later became president of Loew's Inc. and then MGM. Loew's became the last theatre in Times Square to continue booking vaudeville acts as that medium declined in the 1930s; when it hosted its last vaudeville show on December 23, 1947, sentimental goodbyes were made from the stage in recognition of the end of an era. In March 1959 the theater completed an $850,000 remodeling that reduced the number of seats from 3,316 to 1,885 but made them wider and increased the space between rows. The proscenium arch also was eliminated and a wide-screen projector was installed to permit the showing of CinemaScope and VistaVision (but not Cinerama) motion pictures. The interior was redecorated using a beige-on-gold palette. The remodeled theater reopened with the New York premiere of Some Like It Hot, with Marilyn Monroe in attendance. The theatre held a number of very notable world premieres including The Three Musketeers (1948), Annie Get Your Gun (1950), Ben-Hur (1959) and Becket (1964). The cinema was split into two in 1968 with the former balcony re-opening on December 18, 1968 as the State II with 1,214 seats with the U.S. premiere of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The orchestra was renamed State I with 1,172 seats. In March 1972, State I held the world premiere of The Godfather, which also opened the following day at State II.

It consists of a roughly 5,000-strong French force, which is permanently headquartered in N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. The operation is lead in cooperation with five countries, and former French colonies, that span the Sahel: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. These countries are collectively referred to as the \\"G5 Sahel\\". The operation is named after a crescent-shaped dune in the Sahara desert.Hollande announces new military operation in West Africa , france24.com. The French military initially intervened in Mali in early 2013 as part of Operation Serval which successfully regained the northern half of the country from Islamist groups. Operation Barkhane is intended to act as a follow up to this success and has expanded the French military's operations over a vast area of the Sahel region. The operation has the stated aim of helping these countries' governments to maintain control of their territory while also preventing the region from becoming a safe haven for Islamist terrorist groups planning to attack France and Europe.  Background  As part of the fallout from the Libyan Civil War, instability in northern Mali caused by a Tuareg rebellion against the central Malian government was exploited by Islamist groups who gained control over the northern half of the country. In response, France launched a military operation in January 2013 to stop the Islamist offensive from toppling the Malian government and to re-capture northern Mali. The operation, codenamed Operation Serval, ended in the complete re-capture of all Islamist held territory by the operations conclusion on the 15 July 2014. French soldiers and VBCIs patrolling near Gao, Mali as part of Operation Serval, in March 2013. Following the end of Operation Serval, France recognised the need to provide stability in the wider Sahel region by helping the region's various governments combat terrorism. The Former French Defense Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said that France recognised that “there still is a major risk that jihadists develop in the area that runs from the Horn of Africa to Guinea-Bissau.” Therefore, Operation Barkhane was launched in order to assure the Sahel nations' security, and in effect France's security. The operation is the successor of Operation Serval, the French military mission in Mali, and Operation Epervier, the mission in Chad.Opération Barkhane, French Ministry of Defense.  Aim  The operation aims \\"to become the French pillar of counterterrorism in the Sahel region.\\" According to French Defence Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, the main objective of Operation Barkhane is counter-terrorism: \\"The aim is to prevent what I call the highway of all forms of traffics to become a place of permanent passage, where jihadist groups between Libya and the Atlantic Ocean can rebuild themselves, which would lead to serious consequences for our security.\\"France Launches New Sahel Counter- Terrorism Operation Barkhane, ibtimes.co.uk. The concept of 'partnership' has been emphasised to explain the deployment of the French troops. The main objective of the French military intervention is the direct support of the G5 Sahel forces, through training and the introduction of new technologies and resources. Former French President, François Hollande, has said the Barkhane force will allow for a \\"rapid and efficient intervention in the event of a crisis\\" in the region. The operation will target Islamist extremists in Mali, Chad, and Niger, and will have a mandate to operate across borders.  Forces committed  = French forces = The French force was initially a 3,000-strong counter-terrorism force, with 1,000 soldiers deployed indefinitely in Mali. These soldiers were to be focused on counter-terrorism operations in northern Mali, with another 1,200 soldiers stationed in Chad, and the remaining soldiers split between a surveillance base in Niger, a bigger permanent base in Ivory Coast, and some special forces in Burkina Faso. According to original plans, the French forces were supplied with 20 helicopters, 200 armored vehicles, 10 transport aircraft, 6 fighter planes, and 3 drones. French Army Aviation currently have two Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma's in Chad. The Sahel region The division of labor between France and the G5 Sahel has been established by four permanent military bases: (1) headquarters and an air force base in the Chadian capital of N'Djamena (under the leadership of French Général Palasset); (2) a regional base in Gao, north Mali, with at least 1,000 men; (3) a special-forces base in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou; (4) an intelligence base in Niger's capital, Niamey, with over 300 men. The Niamey airbase is strategically important because it hosts drones in charge of gathering intelligence across the entire Sahel- Saharan region. From Niamey, France's troops are supported by two German Transall C-160. In 2020, France stated that it will deploy 600 soldiers in addition to the existing force to fight the Islamist militants in Africa's Sahel. The aviation support is provided the French Groupement Tactique Désert- Aérocombat. = British support = In March 2016, during the UK-France Summit in Paris, the British government announced that it would consider providing support to Operation Barkhane. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon then announced that the UK would provide monthly strategic airlift support to French forces in Africa. In July 2018, three RAF Chinook helicopters arrived in Mali to provide logistical and troop movement support to French and other military forces operating in the area. This deployment is in addition to the 90 British troops already deployed in the region. In September 2018, Forces.net reported that to date the RAF Chinooks Mk5s have made 30 sorties, transporting over 700 French troops, supplies and 70 tons of equipment across Mali. In July, 2020, the British Defense Ministry announced that nearly 250 British Army troops would train and deploy to Mali to serve as a long-range reconnaissance force for United Nations forces. =Estonia= On March 22, 2018, the Ministry of Defence of Estonia announced its intention to commit up to 50 troops and 5 Pasi XA-188 armoured vehicles to Mali as part of Operation Barkhane, to be based in Gao, pending approval by the Riigikogu. The unit, named ESTPLA-26 and headed by Maj. Kristjan Karist, was detached from the C Infantry Company of the Scouts Battalion on August 6, and arrived in Mali that same week to be stationed at the French military base in Gao.

Two French soldiers from the 1st Spahi Regiment were killed and the Colonel-in-chief was wounded on 21 February when the armoured vehicle they were travelling in struck a mine between the towns of Gao and Menaka. On 14 April 2018, JNIM militants launched an attack on a UN base in Timbuktu, wounding several French soldiers before being repelled by French, Malian and American troops. Four French soldiers were seriously wounded by a suicide car bomb attack against a joint French- Malian patrol in Gao on 1 July 2018. The attack, which heavily damaged a number of French VBCIs, also killed 4 civilians and seriously wounded 27 others. On 22 February 2019, French forces backed by an armed reaper drone and a helicopter attacked a JNIM convoy killing 11 militants including senior leader Yahia Abou el Hamman in the Tombouctou Region of Mali. A militant improvised explosive device struck a French armoured vehicle carrying out an anti-terrorist operation in the Mopti Region on 2 April, killing one French soldier and seriously wounding another. Two French commandos of the Commandos Marine were killed on 9 May in the North of Burkina Faso during a rescue mission which successfully rescued four hostages, included two Frenchmen, and an American and South Korean woman, who had been kidnapped by Islamists. In mid-June 2019, a French Army Light Aviation Gazelle helicopter crashed in the border region between Mali and Niger after being fired upon by insurgent small arms fire. The two pilots and a special forces sniper were subsequently rescued by another helicopter after destroying the damaged helicopter. The French military base in Gao was assaulted by suicide bombers on 22 July in an attack that wounded 6 Estonian soldiers and a similar number of French personnel. A French soldier was killed on 2 November 2019 when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device during a patrol near Menaka in eastern Mali. French commandos launched a heli-borne raid later that month on an insurgent camp in Mali's eastern regions, which resulted in five insurgents killed and one French soldier being seriously injured. On 25 November 2019, 13 French soldiers were killed in northern Mali when two French helicopters, a 'Tigre' and a 'Cougar', collided in mid-air while flying to reinforce soldiers engaged in combat with insurgents. The loss of 13 soldiers was the heaviest loss of life for the French military since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. On 21 December 2019, the French military killed 40 militants in an operation in the Mopti Region of Mali. The area where the operation took place was controlled by Macina Liberation Front and it involved France's first ever use of a drone strike which accounted for 33 of the 40 killed insurgents. The French Defense Minister Florence Parly announced in February 2020 that France would send an additional 600 troops to the Sahel region, bolstering Operation Barkhanes' force to 5,100 troops. The first contingent of these reinforcements was 200 French Foreign Legion paratroopers from the 2e REP who were transported to Niger and formed a battle group called Desert Tactical Grouping (GTD) \\"Altor\\". This battle group operated autonomously and without a base on the ground for over a month, receiving supplies only by airdrop. GTD Altor killed over a dozen insurgents and disrupted their logistics throughout their initial month-long operation. Two legionnaires from the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (1er REC) were seriously wounded when their vehicle struck an IED during operations against insurgents on 23 April 2020; one of the legionnaires subsequently died from his wounds. On 4 May 2020, a second legionnaire from the 1er REC was killed in action near Gao during a firefight with an insurgent force. On 3 June, French forces achieved one of their most significant successes of Operation Barkhane with the killing of Abdelmalek Droukdel, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). French and American intelligence sources had identified Droukdel's presence in a group crossing the Algerian-Malian border approximately 80 kilometres east of the town of Tessalit. French special forces subsequently conducted an air assault to intercept the group during which they shot and killed Droukdel and a number of other militants. A French soldier from the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment (1er RHP) was killed during combat operations in Mali on 23 July 2020 when an improvised explosive device was triggered next to his armoured vehicle.  Casualties  =French forces= 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment (35e RAP) board a helicopter during a mission.300px Prior to the beginning of Operation Barkhane, 10 French troops had been killed in Mali as part of Operation Serval. In the subsequent six years since the launch of Operation Barkhane in 2014, a further 37 French troops have died on operations, bringing the total number of French troops killed during the military intervention in Mali and the Sahel to 47. The vast distances of Operation Barkhane force's area of operations across the Sahel pose a significant challenge in dealing with French casualties, with wounded troops being possibly up to from advanced medical aid. To overcome these challenges, the French military created helicopter-mobile medical teams which can rapidly carry out MEDEVAC missions and transport casualties to more advanced medical care. Between 2013 and 2016, French forces sustained 1,272 casualties which required MEDEVAC; of these casualties, 18.2% were wounded in action, 27.4% suffered trauma injuries and 46.6% were suffering from disease or sickness. =Insurgent forces= After the first year of operations, the French Army claimed that approximately 125 insurgents had been neutralized by French forces. In late 2015, French army representatives indicated that over 150 ammunition and explosive depositories had been discovered and 25 vehicles and 80 electronic device (GPS, computers, satellite phones and radio stations) had been destroyed. This represented 20 tons of ammunition, including 2,000 shells, 680 grenades, guided missiles, 25 IEDs and mines, 210 detonators, 30 mortars, machine guns and rocket launchers. The army also seized of various drugs. French forces continued to inflict significant casualties in 2016, with nearly 150 insurgents killed or captured in that year.François-Xavier Freland, Gal Bernard Barrera: \\"Barkhane est entrée dans une phase de stabilisation\\", Jeune Afrique, 17 March 2016. By July 2017, the French Forces estimated that over 400 insurgents had been killed since the start of Operation Barkhane.Laurent Lagneau, \\"Sahel: Le général Bruno Guibert a pris le commandement de la force Barkhane\\", Opex360.com, 31 July 2017. In February 2018, the French Defense Minister, Florence Parly, indicated that 450 jihadists have been neutralized, amongst which 120 have been killed and 150 held as prisoners by Malian authorities. In July 2018, General Bruno Guibert, head of the Barkhane force, confirmed that 120 terrorists had been killed since the beginning of the year. In February 2019, Parly announced that over 600 jihadists had been \\"neutralized\\" since the beginning of the operation in 2014.\\"Sahel : plus de 600 djihadistes \\"neutralisés\\" par l'armée française depuis 2015\\", L'Express avec AFP, 28 February 2019.  Opinions and opposition  = Divided opinions = Since 2013 and the beginning of the Operation Serval, replaced by Operation Barkhane in 2014, opinions in Mali have been divided as to the legitimacy of the French intervention. According to Mission head for Peace in Mali for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Aurélien Tobie, \\"Between 2013 and 2015, we quickly realised, after the peace agreements in Ouagadougou and Algiers for Mali that the Malian opinion towards the French presence was changing. People were supporting the Serval Operation, but did not understand why the French presence was being prolonged with the Barkhane Operation\\". In 2017, the study \\"Mali-Meter\\", conducted by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Mali, polled the level of satisfaction with Operation Barkhane amongst the Malian population. Less than half of the respondents were satisfied with the French intervention. The study also showed geographical disparities in approbation of Operation Barkhane. According to Aurélien Tobie, the differences of opinion between the North and the South of the country can be explained by the difference in proximity of the population with the operations: \\"People in contact with the forces of Barkhane in the North of the country approve of it much more because they see changes in their daily lives. Conversely, people interviewed in Southern Mali, who are generally higher educated but also further away from the conflict zone, are much more critical of the French presence\\". Demonstrations against the French presence have been taking place since 2013 in Mali, on a regular basis. Patriotic groups have been emerging. These groups strive for an end of the French presence and some call for a Russian intervention. In June 2019, a former Malian minister anonymously declared to French newspaper Libération that anti-French sentiment is at its peak in Mali: \\"Conspiracy theories are flourishing everywhere. Soon, France will be accused of being responsible for the floods. The inertia of our own leaders is the primary cause of the problem\\". Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita also strongly criticised anti-French demonstrations. He stated in December 2019 that: \\"the foreign forces in our country are our allies in this tragic war imposed on us. We will not win this war by misunderstanding who our true enemy is and by falling into the trap of the terrorist groups\\". French President Emmanuel Macron has denounced a \\"disinformation campaign\\" led by a rival power, implying it was Russia, although he did not explicitly name it. = Françafrique = Many of the critics on the French intervention are revolving around the concept of Françafrique, a pejorative term used to describe the alleged neocolonial practices of France in its former African colonies. The Sahel is France's principal source of uranium. Niger, Mali's closest neighbour, is the fifth largest uranium producer in the world. The uranium mines owned by the French company Areva in Niger are located only away from Jihadist bastions in Mali. As security of the border between Mali and Niger is supposedly poor, there is a perception that the rise of ISIS in the region threatens these uranium mines; some critics argue that this is the true purpose of the French intervention.

It is located west of the village of Aldea del ObispoTourist & Motoring Atlas – Spain & Portugal. Publisher; Michelin 2014 edition. Work: page 42, Aldea del Obispo, Grid coordinates J9. in the province of Salamanca, western Spain, part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. The fortress was constructed there because of its position of great strategic significance due to its proximity to the border between Spain and Portugal which lies to the west of the fortress. The Fortress of the Concepcion is also opposite the Portuguese castle fortress of Almeida which lies west-north-west of the fortress. In 2006, the derelict fortress was sold privately and the site was renovated into a luxury hotel which opened in 2012.  History  In 1640, following the death of Philip II, the conflict known as the Portuguese Restoration War began. The new Spanish King, Philip III of Spain, intended to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles stood to lose all of their power. As a consequence the Portuguese restored their independence from Spain. On the 1 December 1640, following a military coup the Duke of Braganza was proclaimed king of Portugal and became John IV. The Spanish King began to make plans to recover the throne of Portugal and part of these plans was the strengthening of fortifications along the border along with the construction of new fortress along the border of the two countries. The area of the border between the River Côa and the River Águeda became a buffer zone between the two kingdoms. The Fortress of the Concepcion was one of the new fortress constructed by order of the Duke of Osuna, commander of the Spanish Army and was located in this area to serve as a military station for the Spanish army to recover Portugal. = Construction = The construction of the fortress was under the control of the French military engineer Simon Jocquet and work began on the 8 December 1663, The Feast day of the Immaculate Conception hence the name given to the new fortress. The first phase of construction was completed on the 20 January 1664 taking just 40 days. This first phase sore the construction built around a large central courtyard with Pentagon bastions built in each corner with reinforced earthworks around the perimeter with addition of bundle of brushwood fascine's and filled Baskets of woven wicker timbers woven around stakes in circles to form Redoubts. The fort was garrisoned by 1500 infantrymen and 200 cavalrymen. = 1664 De-commissioning = On the 7 July 1664 the Spanish and Portuguese forces clashed at the Battle of Castelo Rodrigo. Following the initial success of the Spanish army, the Portuguese sent reinforced of 3,000 men under the leadership of Viscount of Fonte Arcada. The Portuguese counter-attack proved decisive. Many prisoners were taken and all the artillery pieces captured. It is told that Osuna and John of Austria the Younger, escaped from Castelo Rodrigo disguised as monks. Following Osuna’s fall from grace Philip III of Spain took over control of the army and he ordered the partial demolition of Fort Concepcion, which had been operational for less than a year. What remained was still occasionally used as a base for Spanish troops in the border area. = 1735 Re-construction = In 1668 the Spanish officially recognised the independence of the Portuguese kingdom but the border zone was regarded with suspicion by both countries. The following decades saw the Portuguese improving the fortified strongholds at Olivenza then part of Portugal, Elvas, Valença do Minho and Almeida and in reaction to these border fortification enhancements, the Spanish reacted by instigate works on a line of fortifications to the Spanish side of the Border. Following the establishment of the Bourbon dynasty with the reign of Philip V, the First Ministers José Patiño ordered the re-construction and enhancement of Fort Concepcion. The works on the new structure were built using much of the previous fortress's footprint. In charge of the construction was the military engineer Pedro Moreau in collaboration with the architect and sculptor Manuel Lara Churriguera. Work began in May 1736. Moreau's work was taken over by Antonio de Gaver and Juan Giraldo de Chaves on several occasions when he was called away to work on the fortifications at Oran in Algeria, and Cádiz. The Fortress was completed in 1758 just before war erupted once more in 1762 between the Spanish and British. During this War the Spanish invaded Portugal, using Concepcion as Cantonment, but the area around the fortress remained quiet and when hostilities ended in 1763 not a shot had been fired in anger, from, or towards the fortress. = The Peninsular War = The Peninsular War started when French and Spanish armies occupied Portugal in 1807, and escalated in 1808 when France turned on Spain, and as a consequence the Fortress of Concepcion fall into the control of the French forces. On the 24 May 1808 French troops under the command of General Louis Henri Loison marched on the Fortress of Almeida. = French Occupation = By the 12 June Loison had turned his attention on to the Fortress of Concepcion. The French column informed the fort's Governor that they had arrived to relieve the garrison. Fearing the behaviour of the French column, the Governor and his garrison quickly abandoned the fort to the French, escaping there clutches by slipping out the fort's postern gate. Loison now occupied both Concepcion and the Fortress of Almeida. By the 16 June Loison had received orders to march on the city of Porto to suppress an insurrection by the Portuguese against the French occupation. Loison set out and on reaching the town of Mesão Frio Google Books northwest of Almeida, his troops were stopped by Portuguese insurgents. On retreating to Almeida, Loison received a fresh dispatch from General Junot ordering him to march on Lisbon which was threatening insurrection. Before leaving Almeida, Loison arranged to have the cannons and garrison of Fort Concepcion moved to Almeida and to have the northernmost bastions of the fortress blown up in the hope of rendering the fortress useless if it fell into the enemies hands. = French withdrawal = On the 30 August 1808 the Convention of Sintra was signed by General Junot, which under the Unfavourable terms of the treaty, the French Army, all its equipment and all its baggage was to be evacuated from Portugal and eastern Spain by the British Navy from Porto as soon as possible. By October British Forces had re-occupied the fortress of Concepcion and the fortress of Almeida. Despite the retreat of General Sir John Moore to A Coruña in January 1809 the fortress remained in the hands of the Portuguese and British. = 1810 = Unable to take command personally, Napoleon appointed his most dependable Marshal, Masséna to take charge of the Army of Portugal in April 1810. This army of three corps had a total of 65,000 men with a further reinforcement of 20,000 troops once they were ready. By May 1810 Wellington's forces were becoming strong and supplies and manpower was on the increase. Wellingtons espionage network had informed him of Masséna appointment and a French lieutenant who had deserted to one of Craufurd's pickets revelled that the French had moved 80,000 troops to the province and where preparing to Invade Portugal once more at the earliest convenience. Wellington's response to an impending invasion of Portugal from Ciudad Rodrigo was to strengthen his defences in the borders. He ordered the refortifying of the Fortress of the Concepcion, and to repair the damage done to the forts partially destroyed bastions which had been inflicted by the French in there 1808 retreat. Brigadier General William Cox, the military governor of Almeida was in charge of the works. He attempted to enlist Spanish Labourers’ to do the work but this was unsuccessful and he was forced to use soldiers of the Portuguese 9th Line to complete the work. The refortifications were overseen by Captain John Burgoyne of Corps of Royal Engineers. As well as the Portuguese soldiers, Burgoyne also had a small collection of skilled Portuguese stonemasons and carpenters at his disposal. The workforce set about clearing all the debris in the surrounding ditches caused by the French partial destructions and palisades were erected. Repairs were also made to the bastions at the north end of the fortress. The bridge into the fortress was repaired along with the draw bridge, covered walkways and gates. Burgoyne was also ordered to sink mines in to the two previously undamaged formidable bastions. Six tons of gunpowder were piled in barrels, in each of the four demilunes, and more barrels of powder were stacked in the casemates of the adjoining curtain walls to the four bastions. Further explosives were placed in the central arch of the forts redoubt and the casemates and blockhouse to the south east of the fortress were packed with a total of three tons of powder. The strategy behind these set explosives charges was that if the fortress was likely to fall into the hands of the French, the retreating garrison would set the charges, destroying the fortress to prevent the French from using Concepcion as a base to attack Almeida. Once the fortifications had been repaired, Brigadier Cox kept the Portuguese 9th line along with 120 artillerymen sent from Almeida, to garrison the fortress. He also sent two howitzers, four sets of six guns and four sets of eight guns. With the hardware he also 12,000 rations, 10,000 rounds of ammunition and 100 rounds for each piece of artillery supplied. Cox also stationed four companies of the 45th Foot which were divided between the two near-by villages of Aldea del Obispo and Vale da Mula.Tourist & Motoring Atlas – Spain & Portugal. Publisher; Michelin 2014 edition. Work: page 42, Vale da Mula, Grid coordinates J9. These troops would quickly reinforce the fortress if it became under attack. = Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo = On the 26 April 1810 the French Army of Portugal took up position to Besiege the Spanish fortified town of Ciudad Rodrigo as a prelude to there planned invasion of Portugal. Under The Masséna's plan his forces needed to capture and consolidate this border town to use as a base for there invasion army. On the 25 June a concerned Wellington decided to visit the fortified town of Almeida. He held discussions with Brigadier General Cox, the governor of the fortress and toured the local picket posts and positions along the border manned by Crauford's Light Divisions. He also visited the fortress of the Concepcion, inspecting the repairs and preparations made by Captain Burgoyne. After his tour of inspection, Wellington returned to Almeida and wrote a memo to Crauford suggesting modifications and improvements which he should make. Along with these recommendations were suggestions of the way a tactical withdraw should proceed, when, as Wellington expected, the French attacked the border. The Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo ended on the 9 July when the French VI Corps under the command of Marshal Michel Ney took the fortified city when the Governor of the city Don Andrés Perez de Herrasti surrendered his 5,500-man Spanish garrison which had put up a gallant defence of the city only to be beaten when Ney’s artillery opened a breach in the walls. The siege had delayed Masséna's invasion plans for Portugal by over a month, but now the French were ready to move west towards Almeida with the Fort of Concepcion lying in there path. = The Capture and Destruction of the Fort of Concepcion = Even before the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo, the French had probed the British picket defences to the west of the city towards the border. On the 4 July, General Junot had accompanied General Sainte-Croix on a reconnaissance of the area. Following several skirmishes and actions Junot had reconnoitred the fortress of Concepcion following which he withdrew all his forces to Ciudad Rodrigo. Wellingtons strategy now instructed Burgoyne to prepare for the withdrawal of the fortress's garrison and to demolish the fortress with his prepared charges. By the 4 July the Portuguese 9th line, Portuguese Artillery battery and the four companys of the 45th foot had withdrawn to Picton's Division near the town of Pinhel. At the fortress the three companies of Portuguese Caçadores which had been left on picket duty were replaced with horseman of the 14th Light dragoons, and two companies of the 95th Rifles, who had been tasked with guarding the fortress and its demolition mines. In the early hours of the morning on the 21 July Loison's 25th Dragoons and 3rd Hussars along with infantry crossed the Dos Casas stream and rapidly proceeded up the hillside from Aldea del Obispo towards the Fortress of Concepcion. In front of them, in full retreat were the 14 th Light Dragoons. Captain Brotherton sent one of his officers ahead of the retreat to Inform Burgoyne that his Light Dragoons were retreating and that time was short before the French would be on the fortress. Brotherton was able to delay the French long enough for Burgoyne’s mines to be fired. At 4.45am they exploded hurling the debris of the fortress's masonry across the surrounding countryside. A number of men and horses of the dragoons were caught and killed in the explosion. Burgoyne reported that one side of the fortress had blown up although he was unable to ascertain an exact damage report due to the fact that the British forces had to rapidly evacuate the fort before all the four mines had been set to explode. The Fortress had been severally damaged but the French who had now taken possession discovered that only one of the three mines had detonated. There had been several other smaller explosions to the structure and the fortress defences had been seriously compromised. = The Second French Occupation = Following the explosions, Loison, under Ney’s orders took possession of Concepcion and its surrounding plateau for the second time. The French now would use Concepcion’s close proximity to the Fortress of Almeida to use as a base for the organisation of the Investment of the Fortress. There now began a period of activity which involved preparation for Concepcion to be the Headquarters for Marshal Masséna. The men of Masséna État-major (Staff) moved into some of the remaining bomb proof casemates along with their horses. Masséna first aide-de-camp, Pelet also took up residence in a casemate. With this influx of staff and men into the fortress, some resources were added, including the setting up of four baking ovens along with many bakers. To garrison the fort three companies of Taupin’s infantry Brigades. French army laid siege to Almeida on July 25, 1810. On the 16 August Masséna took up residence in the old fortress's Governors quarters to oversee the operations personally. However Masséna stay at Concepcion was short. By the 26 August the Siege of Almeida was over. Masséna’s Army of Portugal swiftly took occupation of Almeida and then moved on towards Lisbon. Wellington’s tactics of delaying Masséna along the borderlands close to Concepcion and his tactical withdrawal's from the border Fortress's had given him time to construct the Lines of Torres Vedras which ultimately forced the French out of Portugal = Second French withdrawal = By October Masséna’s army was at Lines of Torres Vedras which proved to be the obstacle that stopped the French from taking Lisbon. Day by Day the Allied Army of Wellington grew stronger with reinforcements of troops, supplies and equipment from Britain arriving daily. The Portuguese army was now well trained and its numbers had increased. Napoleon, despite requests from Masséna, had only sent a further 7,000 troops to reinforce the Army of Portugal but the biggest obstacle to Masséna was the lack of supplies. By March 1811 his army was starving and its munitions and powder where almost depleted. On the 5 March 1811 Masséna ordered the retreat from Portugal. Just south of Concepcion is the Border village of Fuentes de Oñoro. The defeat of Masséna’s forces at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro between the 3 and 4 May 1811 was the final action that saw the French pushed out of Portugal. Before the battle, Wellington's Allied army had taken up positions along the line of low hills which ran from the Fort of Concepcion towards Fuentes de Oñoro.

It enshrines the Marian image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage (), and is the seat of the Bishop of Antipolo. It is also the Immaculate Conception Parish and is referred to by locals as the \\"Simbahan ng Antipolo\\" (Church of Antipolo). The shrine attracts millions of pilgrims annually, especially during the Pilgrimage Season which commences with the Alay Lakad from Quiapo Church on April 30 until the month of May.  History  The first missionaries of Antipolo were the Franciscans. The first church in what is now Antipolo City was built by the Society of Jesus under Rev. Juan de Salazar. The Jesuits administered the church from 1591 to 1768. The church was prepared for the image of Nuestra Señora dela Paz y Buen Viaje in 1632. However, the church structure was greatly damaged during the Chinese uprising in 1639 and the earthquakes of 1645, 1824 and 1863. The church, meant to house the image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage brought by then-Governor General Juan Niño de Tabora, was supposed to be built on a different plot of land. The church's present location was the site of the tipolo (Artocarpus blancoi), top which the image was found after mysteriously vanishing several times. The church was completed in 1632, but suffered severe damage in 1639 when the Sangley (Chinese) set fire to the church in a revolt. It was restored afterwards though it was damaged by the 1645 Luzon earthquake, and other earthquakes in 1824 and 1863. Nevertheless, the church became a popular pilgrimage site as many devotees paid reverence to Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage, including Philippine national hero and polymath José Rizal, who visited the shrine as a boy with his father, Francisco Mercado, on 6 June 1868. The pair went on pilgrimage to fulfill a vow Rizal's mother, Teodora Alonso, had made when she and the boy survived his delivery. Towards the end of the Second World War in 1945, the church was destroyed by Allied bombardment meant to liberate the area from the Japanese imperial control. After the war, a campaign was organized to build a new church, with the fundraising committee headed by former First Lady Aurora Quezon and Antipolo parish priest, Francisco Avendano. Architect José L. de Ocampo was commissioned to design the new shrine. The construction began in 1948 and completed in 1954. On 14 January 1954, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines declared the new Antipolo Church as declared the National Shrine to Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage. The church was elevated to the status of cathedral on 25 June 1983, upon the canonical erection of the Diocese of Antipolo.  Pilgrimage Season  The Pilgrimage Season of the cathedral is initiated yearly by the \\"Pagdalaw ng Ina sa Anak\\" (Mother's Visit to her Son), which is the temporary transfer of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage from Antipolo Cathedral to Quiapo Church, where the Black Nazarene is enshrined. A welcome Mass is held in Quiapo Church at 9:00 in the morning. At 6:00 p.m., the farewell Mass is celebrated, after which the Penitential Walk from Quiapo Church to Antipolo Cathedral commences, with a distance close to 33 kilometers. On the first of May each year, the return of the image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage at the cathedral is celebrated by a Mass at 5:00 in the morning. Every first Tuesday of May, a procession of the image starts at 7:00 a.m. from the cathedral to Pinagmisahan Hill where, at the end, a Mass is celebrated. It was here on May 3, the Feast of the Holy Cross, that a wooden cross was blessed and erected. Since 1947, a commemorative thanksgiving Mass is celebrated on the very first Tuesday of May, inaugurating the start of the Pilgrimage Season which ends on the first Tuesday of July.

This site has been referred to as the gabapentin receptor (α2δ subunit), as it is the target of the drugs gabapentin and pregabalin. Clinically-used gabapentinoids include gabapentin, pregabalin, and mirogabalin, as well as a gabapentin prodrug, gabapentin enacarbil. Additionally, phenibut has been found to act as a gabapentinoid in addition to its action of functioning as a GABAB receptor agonist. Further analogues like imagabalin are in clinical trials but have not yet been approved. Other gabapentinoids which are used in scientific research but have not been approved for medical use include atagabalin, 4-methylpregabalin and PD-217,014. Medical uses Gabapentinoids are approved for the treatment of epilepsy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Some off-label uses of gabapentinoids include the treatment of insomnia, migraine, social phobia, panic disorder, mania, bipolar disorder, and alcohol withdrawal. Existing evidence on the use of gabapentinoids in chronic lower back pain is limited, and demonstrates significant risk of adverse effects, without any demonstrated benefit. Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Gabapentinoids are ligands of the auxiliary α2δ subunit site of certain , and thereby act as inhibitors of α2δ subunit-containing VDCCs. There are two drug-binding α2δ subunits, α2δ-1 and α2δ-2, and the gabapentinoids show similar affinity for (and hence lack of selectivity between) these two sites. The gabapentinoids are selective in their binding to the α2δ VDCC subunit. However, phenibut uniquely also binds to and acts as an agonist of the GABAB receptor with lower affinity (~5- to 10-fold in one study). Despite the fact that gabapentinoids are GABA analogues, gabapentin and pregabalin do not bind to the GABA receptors, do not convert into or GABA receptor agonists in vivo, and do not modulate GABA transport or metabolism. There is currently no evidence that the relevant actions of gabapentin and pregabalin are mediated by any mechanism other than inhibition of α2δ-containing VDCCs. Although, gabapentinoids such as gabapentin, but not pregabalin, have been found to activate Kv voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNQ). The endogenous α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, which closely resemble the gabapentinoids in chemical structure, are apparent ligands of the α2δ VDCC subunit with similar affinity as gabapentin and pregabalin (e.g., IC50 = 71 nM for L-isoleucine), and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations (e.g., 12.9 μM for L-leucine, 4.8 μM for L-isoleucine). It has been hypothesized that they may be the endogenous ligands of the subunit and that they may competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentinoids. In accordance, while gabapentin and pregabalin have nanomolar affinities for the α2δ subunit, their potencies in vivo are in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous L-amino acids has been said to likely be responsible for this discrepancy. In one study, the affinity (Ki) values of gabapentinoids for the α2δ subunit expressed in rat brain were found to be 0.05 μM for gabapentin, 23 μM for (R)-phenibut, 39 μM for (S)-phenibut, and 156 μM for baclofen. Their affinities (Ki) for the GABAB receptor were >1 mM for gabapentin, 92 μM for (R)-phenibut, >1 mM for (S)-phenibut, and 6 μM for baclofen. Based on the low affinity of baclofen for the α2δ subunit relative to the GABAB (26-fold difference), its affinity for the α2δ subunit is unlikely to be of pharmacological importance. Pregabalin has demonstrated significantly greater potency (about 2.5-fold) than gabapentin in clinical studies. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption Gabapentin and pregabalin are absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, SLC7A5), a transporter for amino acids such as L-leucine and L-phenylalanine. Very few (less than 10 drugs) are known to be transported by this transporter. Unlike gabapentin, which is transported solely by the LAT1, pregabalin seems to be transported not only by the LAT1 but also by other carriers. The LAT1 is easily saturable, so the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin are dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses. Conversely, this is not the case for pregabalin, which shows linear pharmacokinetics and no saturation of absorption. Similarly, gabapentin enacarbil is transported not by the LAT1 but by the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and the sodium- dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), and no saturation of bioavailability has been observed with the drug up to a dose of 2,800 mg. Similarly to gabapentin and pregabalin, baclofen, a close analogue of phenibut (baclofen specifically being 4-chlorophenibut), is transported by the LAT1, although it is a relatively weak substrate for the transporter. The oral bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 80% at 100 mg administered three times daily once every 8 hours, but decreases to 60% at 300 mg, 47% at 400 mg, 34% at 800 mg, 33% at 1,200 mg, and 27% at 1,600 mg, all with the same dosing schedule. Conversely, the oral bioavailability of pregabalin is greater than or equal to 90% across and beyond its entire clinical dose range (75 to 900 mg/day). Food does not significantly influence the oral bioavailability of pregabalin. Conversely, food increases the area-under-curve levels of gabapentin by about 10%. Drugs that increase the transit time of gabapentin in the small intestine can increase its oral bioavailability; when gabapentin was co-administered with oral morphine (which slows intestinal peristalsis), the oral bioavailability of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin increased by 50%. The oral bioavailability of gabapentin enacarbil (as gabapentin) is greater than or equal to 68%, across all doses assessed (up to 2,800 mg), with a mean of approximately 75%. In contrast to the other gabapentinoids, the pharmacokinetics of phenibut have been little-studied, and its oral bioavailability is unknown. However, it would appear to be at least 63% at a single dose of 250 mg, based on the fact that this fraction of phenibut was recovered from the urine unchanged in healthy volunteers administered this dose. Gabapentin at a low dose of 100 mg has a Tmax (time to peak levels) of approximately 1.7 hours, while the Tmax increases to 3 to 4 hours at higher doses. The Tmax of pregabalin is generally less than or equal to 1 hour at doses of 300 mg or less. However, food has been found to substantially delay the absorption of pregabalin and to significantly reduce peak levels without affecting the bioavailability of the drug; Tmax values for pregabalin of 0.6 hours in a fasted state and 3.2 hours in a fed state (5-fold difference), and the Cmax is reduced by 25–31% in a fed versus fasted state. In contrast to pregabalin, food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax of gabapentin by approximately 10%. The Tmax of the instant-release (IR) formulation of gabapentin enacarbil (as active gabapentin) is about 2.1 to 2.6 hours across all doses (350–2,800 mg) with single administration and 1.6 to 1.9 hours across all doses (350–2,100 mg) with repeated administration. Conversely, the Tmax of the extended-release (XR) formulation of gabapentin enacarbil is about 5.1 hours at a single dose of 1,200 mg in a fasted state and 8.4 hours at a single dose of 1,200 mg in a fed state. The Tmax of phenibut has not been reported, but the onset of action and peak effects have been described as occurring at 2 to 4 hours and 5 to 6 hours, respectively, after oral ingestion in recreational users taking high doses (1–3 g). Distribution Gabapentin, pregabalin, and phenibut all cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. However, due to their low lipophilicity, the gabapentinoids require active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports the gabapentinoids that bind to it across into the brain. As with intestinal absorption of gabapentin mediated by LAT1, transport of gabapentin across the blood–brain barrier by LAT1 is saturable. Gabapentin does not bind to other drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) or OCTN2 (SLC22A5). Gabapentin and pregabalin are not significantly bound to plasma proteins (<1%). The phenibut analogue baclofen shows low plasma protein binding of 30%. Metabolism Gabapentin, pregabalin, and phenibut all undergo little or no metabolism. Conversely, gabapentin enacarbil, which acts as a prodrug of gabapentin, must undergo enzymatic hydrolysis to become active. This is done via non-specific esterases in the intestines and to a lesser extent in the liver. Elimination Gabapentin, pregabalin, and phenibut are all eliminated renally in the urine. They all have relatively short elimination half-lives, with reported values of 5.0 to 7.0 hours, 6.3 hours, and 5.3 hours, respectively. Similarly, the terminal half-life of gabapentin enacarbil IR (as active gabapentin) is short at approximately 4.5 to 6.5 hours. The elimination half-life of gabapentin has been found to be extended with increasing doses; in one series of studies, it was 5.4 hours for 200 mg, 6.7 hours for 400 mg, 7.3 hours for 800 mg, 9.3 hours for 1,200 mg, and 8.3 hours for 1,400 mg, all given in single doses. Because of its short elimination half-life, gabapentin must be administered 3 to 4 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. Similarly, pregabalin has been given 2 to 3 times per day in clinical studies. Phenibut, also, is taken 3 times per day. Conversely, gabapentin enacarbil is taken twice a day and gabapentin XR (brand name Gralise) is taken once a day. Chemistry Chemical structures of GABA and some major gabapentinoids The gabapentinoids are 3-substituted derivatives of GABA; hence, they are GABA analogues, as well as γ-amino acids. Specifically, pregabalin is (S)-(+)-3-isobutyl-GABA, phenibut is 3-phenyl-GABA, and gabapentin is a derivative of GABA with a cyclohexane ring at the 3 position (or, somewhat inappropriately named, 3-cyclohexyl- GABA). The gabapentinoids also closely resemble the α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, and this may be of greater relevance in relation to their pharmacodynamics than their structural similarity to GABA. History Gabapentin, under the brand name Neurontin, was first approved in May 1993 for the treatment of epilepsy in the United Kingdom, and was marketed in the United States in 1994. Subsequently, gabapentin was approved in the United States for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in May 2002. A generic version of gabapentin first became available in the United States in 2004. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration, under the brand name Gralise, was approved in the United States for the treatment postherpetic neuralgia in January 2011. Pregabalin, under the brand name Lyrica, was approved in Europe in 2004 and was introduced in the United States in September 2005 for the treatment of epilepsy, postherpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. It was subsequently approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the United States in June 2007. Pregabalin was also approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Europe in 2005, though it has not been approved for this indication in the United States. Gabapentin enacarbil, under the brand name Horizant, was introduced in the United States for the treatment of restless legs syndrome in April 2011 and was approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in June 2012. Phenibut, marketed under the brand names Anvifen, Fenibut, and Noofen, was introduced in Russia in the 1960s for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and a variety of other conditions. It was not discovered to act as a gabapentinoid until 2015. Mirogabalin, under the brand name Tarlige, was approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain and postherpetic neuralgia in Japan in January 2019. Society and culture =Recreational use= Gabapentinoids produce euphoria at high doses, with effects similar to GABAergic central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and benzodiazepines, and are used as recreational drugs (at 3–20 times typical clinical doses). The overall abuse potential is considered to be low and notably lower than that of other drugs such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, psychostimulants, and other illicit drugs. In any case, due to its recreational potential, pregabalin is a schedule V controlled substance in the United States. In April 2019, the United Kingdom scheduled gabapentin and pregabalin as Class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and as Schedule 3 under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. However, it is not a controlled substance in Canada, or Australia, and the other gabapentinoids, including phenibut, are not controlled substances either. As such, they are mostly legal intoxicants. Tolerance to gabapentinoids is reported to develop very rapidly with repeated use, although to also dissipate quickly upon discontinuation, and withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhea have been reported. More severe withdrawal symptoms, such as severe rebound anxiety, have been reported with phenibut. Because of the rapid tolerance with gabapentinoids, users often escalate their doses, while other users may space out their doses and use sparingly to avoid tolerance.

Identification Streptococcus tigrinus is a member of the Gram-positive bacteria family Streptococcaceae and is identifiable by its 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis. S. tigurinus was initially difficult to study due to its similarity to other bacteria causing it to go unnoticed, but it has recently been identified as being the most structurally related to Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus intermedius . Pathogenesis Streptococcus tigurinus is generally not a normal part of the human bacteria flora and it is currently unknown where its natural habitat is or its potential for colonization. Capable of causing serious infections if it manages to enter the body's bloodstream, usually through open wounds in the mouth, it was first discovered to cause invasive infections after it was isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.

It is located on the chord line between Viluppuram and Tiruchirappalli. For administrative reasons, it comes under the Tiruchirappalli railway division of the Southern Railway zone. Location and layout The railway station is situated on the Perambalur main Road on the western part of the city. It is the main railhead for both Ariyalur and Perambalur districts since railway stations in other towns of Ariyalur district such as Lalgudi and Sendurai barely have any express trains halting and Permbalur district does not have a railway station at all, ever since the bifurcation of the Ariyalur district. It hence serves as an important railway hub for passengers from the central districts of Tamil Nadu. The station falls on the Viluppuram-Tiruchirappalli chord line, which is the only line passing through the station. The railway line towards the south has been completed doubling work, spanning across two sections namely the Ariyalur-Kallakudi Palanganatham stretch and then the Valadi-Kallakudi Palanganatham stretch, after which it is single line till Tiruchirappalli. The same double line infrastructure completed extends up to R.S. Mathur towards the north beyond which it is single line again till . Amenities The station has been declared as one of the Adarsh railway stations in Tamil Nadu. Hence it has amenities such as upper-class waiting rooms, ATMs, ramps and wheel chairs for the differently-abled, retiring rooms etc. There is a TNSTC bus station which provides local bus services from the station. The station however is suffering from serious infrastructural problems according to passengers. The withdrawal of many of the direct bus services from the station to Thanjavur, as well as absence of sufficient services on other routes is viewed as a great hardship on the part of commuters to the station. This is compounded by lack of regular bus services from Ariyalur Railway Station to the Ariyalur main bus stand and high auto rickshaw fares for commuting that distance. Lack of porters and petty shops, inadequate number of seats and shelters and unavailability of additional platforms form the other issues at the station. Project on doubling the track between Ariyalur and Valadi segment to a length of 50 km had been executed, the 25-km stretch between Ariyalur and Mathur also commissioned. As part of doubling of the track, the Ariyalur station has been beautified and expanded, according to Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL). Additional platform created was 550 metres. The additional platform would ensure smooth operation of trains.

She both batted and threw right-handed. Early life and career Born in Chicago, Illinois, she lived for around a decade (from when she was 8 until 18) near Wrigley Field. She was the youngest of three sisters. Her Irish immigrant mother was a housewife and her father worked as a truck driver. Since there were very few girls in the neighborhood from the time she turned 10, Gascon had to play ball otherwise she wouldn't have anyone with whom to play. She was pretty good and always went to the division meetings. Gascon studied Education and Psychology at a local college, the Northeastern Illinois State College in Chicago. She used her education to become an elementary teacher for six years and following that, a counselor for 28 years. Since she lived close to the Wrigley Field and her uncle was a policeman who worked at the gate there, Gascon was often given the opportunity to watch Phil Cavarretta, Andy Pafko, etc. Thus began her love for the game. At around 15 years old, Gascon played started playing with the North Town Debs and then the girls started forming groups which was when she went with the Springfield Sallies. With the Sallies, she played second base. Some of her other friends at the time joined the Chicago Colleens. She was recruited from playing in the Chicago playgrounds. In the traveling team she was with Mirtha Marrero and Isabel Alvarez with whom she was able to converse in Spanish since she had studied it in high school. In 1949 she played with the traveling team and a year later, she returned to play with Chicago, for the Bluebirds also for a year, playing center field. In 1951, Gascon returned to the Grand Rapids Chicks, thereafter playing a further three years again with the Bluebirds. During this time she was able to work a day job and play ball simultaneously. In addition, she played with the Peoria Redwings. Gascon was the youngest member of the Chicago Queens, at a time when the New Orleans Jacks teams were part of it who really knew what they were doing, producing some of the best pitchers. Connie Wisnwiewski was also in that league, who had also come to the Grand Rapids Chicks. When Gascon played with the Grand Rapids Chicks, it was in the position of center field. Present day As of 2018, Gascon still attends Chicago Cubs games and expresses a desire to inspire women to continue to play baseball.Kenney, Madeline. \\"In league of her own: Eileen Gascon, 86, hopes to inspire new generation\\", Chicago Sun Times, July 27, 2018; retrieved November 9, 2018.

The two-story frame building was built in 1871; its design features Greek Revival and Italianate elements. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 as the only surviving two-story frame commercial building in the Table Grove area. The building is no longer standing, and was removed from the National Register in 2020. History The building was constructed in 1871 to house a mercantile store owned by brothers William and John H. Carithers. The store was one of several new commercial buildings built in Table Grove in the 1870s, as the village experienced a period of business growth after receiving Rockford, Rock Island and St. Louis Railroad service in 1870. The two-story building, which included office space and a canopy to show goods outdoors, signified that the Carithers brothers expected their store to be successful and long-lasting enough to support such a large building. The store was profitable into the 20th century, as evidenced by John's purchase of a large home in 1897 and the store's inclusion on the Plat of Table Grove in 1912. John's son Dwight B. Carithers and the brothers' nephew William L. Hipsley took over the store in 1898; Hipsley assumed full control after John's death in 1902, as Dwight took over the Carithers family farm in John's place. Hipsley managed the store until 1922, after which time the building was used as a rented storefront, a Sunday school, and a storage area.Thomson, Esmarelda T., and Vernon C. Thomson, Jr. National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Carithers Store Building. National Park Service. February 28, 1987. Architecture The two-story wood frame store featured Greek Revival and Italianate elements in its design, reflecting a contemporary view that even functional buildings should have architectural ornaments. Broken pediments with dentillated eaves covered both gable ends of the building. Greek Revival-inspired pilasters marked three of the building's corners. The tall, narrow windows of the building had arched hoods, a typical Italianate feature. At the time of the building's nomination to the National Register, it was the only surviving two-story frame commercial building within a radius of Table Grove. The building was consequently considered a significant local example of its type, as similar buildings had once existed in nearby communities but had been lost to demolition and decay. However, recent photographs of the site indicate that the building is no longer standing.

It is classed as an acylpicolide and its chemical name is 2,6-dichloro-N-3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]methyl] benzamide. The precise mode of action is not known, but it is thought to act by affecting spectrin-like proteins in the cytoskeleton of oomycetes. This mode of action differs from other available fungicides used to control oomycetes and it can inhibit the growth of strains that are resistant to phenylamides, strobilurin, dimethomorph and iprovalicarb. It has some systemic activity as it moves through the xylem towards the tips of stems, but does not get transported to the roots. It affects the motility of zoospores, the germination of cysts, the growth of the mycelium and sporulation. Bayer CropScience developed the compound and it was first released as a commercial product in 2006. Uses Fluopicolide has been shown to be effective at controlling Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora capsicii, Phytophthora porri, Plasmopara viticola, Perenospora parasitica, Peronospora tabacina, Peronospora sparsa, Pseudoperonospora cubensis and Bremia lactucae. As of 2007, it was only available commercially as a co-formulation with Fosetyl-Al for use in vines (as Profiler) and as a co-formulation with propamocarb for use on potatoes and vegetables (as Infinito). Other products were in development. Toxicity The median lethal dose in rats is >5000 mg/kg meaning that fluopicolide has low acute toxicity. Tests in other mammals indicate that it does not cause skin sensitisation, cancer or developmental problems.

This form of detoxification has gained popularity, as individuals have increased their time spent on digital devices and the Internet.  Background  A 2015 survey conducted by Deloitte found that around 59% of smartphone users check a social media platform in the five minutes prior to going to bed, and within 30 minutes of waking up.  Motivations  Motivations to start a digital detox include: * Concern about developing addictive behavior that some identify as an Internet addiction disorderMorrison, S., & Gomez, R. (2014). \\"Pushback: The Growth of Expressions of Resistance to Constant Online Connectivity\\" (PDF). In iConference 2014 Proceedings (p. 1-15). * Aiming to reduce stress and anxiety caused by the over-use of technology * Re-focusing offline social interactions and actions * Re-connecting with nature * Increasing mindfulness * Improving one's learning ability by decreasing distractions and eliminating multi-tasking  Potential health effects  The extended overuse of technology has been found to reduce quality of sleep, cause eye strain and vision problems, as well as lead to the increased occurrence of migraine headaches. A previous research survey of over 7,000 participants found that approximately 70% of those who use technology with screens have experienced \\"digital eye strain as a result of the growing use of [screen possessing technological devices]\\". Research on the effects of popular technological devices such as cellphones and computers on sleep has suggested that the light emitted from screens may suppress the production of the hormone Melatonin, an important regulatory biochemical that controls the duration and character of sleep cycles.  Potential effects on relationships  A study of 145 American adults recruited through MTurk in 2016 suggested that marital satisfaction can be lowered if either partner \\"snubs\\" the other in favor of using a cellphone. The act was also associated with a higher incidence of depression and a reported lower satisfaction with life. The self- reported attachment styles of the participants were seen to have an effect such that individuals with attachment anxiety reported a higher degree of cell phone conflict. Another study suggested that the visible presence of mobile devices during conversations may have a limiting effect on the sense of connection felt between those involved in the conversation as well as the overall quality of the conversation. Social media detoxification A subset of digital detox is social media detox, which is a period of time when individuals voluntarily stay away from social media. In academic research, social media detoxification is commonly referred to as the \\"non-use of social media\\", and falls under the umbrella of \\"Digital Detox\\", with a focus specifically on unplugging from social media. = Social media rejectors = Based on a 2019 Pew Research Center study, 69% of adults in the United States use Facebook, 73% use YouTube, and 37% use Instagram. A 2012 study found that around 60% of Facebook users have made a conscious effort to voluntarily take a break from Facebook for a time period of several weeks or more. This has been referred to as \\"media refusal\\", with non-users known as \\"social media rejectors\\" who once used social media but have now voluntarily given it up for various reasons.  Methods of Detox  = Social Media Detoxification = A subset of a digital detox is a social media detox, in which an individual voluntarily keeps off of social media platforms. Motivations for performing only a subset of a digital detox could be attributed to the total time spent on social media platforms and the related psychological effects. The use of social media can lead to internet addiction and decrease productivity which is why celebrities such as Ed Sheeran and Kendall Jenner have undergone a social media detox and influenced others to do one as well. Comedian Ari Shaffir gained attention for refusing to use a smartphone after concerns about spending too much time on it, especially on social media. A study found that the average user will spend 5 years and 4 months on social media, which is second only to watching T.V. ,which is at 7 years and 8 months. Many social media users will also visit their platforms multiple times per day, with 68% of snapchat users and 50% of Facebook users doing so. Based on a 2019 Pew Research Center study, 73% of adults in the United States use YouTube, 37% use Instagram and 69% use Facebook with around 60% of Facebook users making an effort to undergo a social media detoxification. = Other Miscellaneous Methods = Most experts agree that moderation is a much more effective method of detoxification than fully forgoing technology. One way of curbing overuse of digital devices is to allocate some of the uses of a smartphone to non- digital means. Google is launching a \\"paper phone\\" which can contain daily agendas, directions, and other uses so that people rely less on their smartphone. In addition, designated 'sacred spaces' wherein smartphone usage is strictly prohibited can help. Criticisms of Digital Detox Over the past decade technology and social media have become an integral aspect of everyday life, and thus the decision to refrain from using technology or social media has become a conscious lifestyle choice reflecting the desire for selective and reversible disconnection. In the digital age, social media plays a vital role in building social capital, maintaining connections, and managing impressions.https://smg.media.mit.edu/papers/Donath/PublicDisplays.pdf Scholars have argued for the importance of maintaining a certain level of distraction that social media can provide for a balanced state of body and mind, and some scholars have even argued that social media is necessary and should not be completely cut out. That being said, many scholars believe that the moderation of social media is essential, primarily due to social media platforms’ goal of encouraging constant use with likes, notifications, and infinite scrolling. To lessen the effects of these addictive features social media platforms such as Instagram have begun to explore alternative methods, such as making likes on a user's post invisible to the user, to shift the focus away from constant notifications and likes. Some companies have even launched movements against technology addiction. For example, In October 2019 Google released Paper Phone, a google product consisting of a printed piece of paper folded into eighths that contains relevant information to your day much like a daily planner. The motive behind the project was to provide the utility of a smartphone in a simplistic and less dynamic delivery. Other projects focusing on building second phones with less functionality are The Light Phone, Siempo, Mudita. Other initiatives put human nature and design above technology such as (The Center of Humane Technology or Bagby (Digital Wellness with a human soul). Some critics disagree with Google's approach to the digital detox phenomenon, however, and instead argue that harmony between technology use and well-being can be achieved. These critics suggest that the best way to digitally detox is to be mindful of the amount of time that is being spent on a digital device.

It is Dubai's first mega themed entertainment destination. The park is divided into five \\"epic zones\\". Two of the five zones represent global brands Cartoon Network and Marvel, while IMG Boulevard and the Lost Valley – Dinosaur Adventure zones are original concepts created by the IMG Group. Novo Cinema is the fifth section of IMG Worlds of Adventure and agreement was signed between Novo Cinema and IMG World of Adventure in May 2015.

It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1573 it was sold as one of 16 villages and the town of Friedeck and formed a state country split from the Duchy of Teschen.

The painting was previously thought to be a depiction of Shakespeare's Hamlet holding the skull of Yorick, but is now considered to be a vanitas, a reminder of the precarious nature of life and the inevitability of death. Painting  The painting shows a young man wearing a feathered red bonnet and swathed with a cloak across his chest, gesturing dramatically towards the viewer with his right hand while holding a skull in his left hand. It was first documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who described it as a life-size half-length portrait of Hamlet. De Groot also wrote that it was exhibited on loan in the Dublin National Gallery in 1895. He noticed this painting's similarity to another painting by Hals, and he remarked that in this work the subject's right hand \\"formerly rested on a skull which has been painted out\\". The interpretation as a theatrical portrayal of Hamlet was called into question by W.R. Valentiner in 1923. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive claims it is a vanitas and compares it to several other examples of men portrayed with skulls. He rejects the identification as Hamlet, because Shakespeare's plays have not been recorded in the Northern Netherlands in the 1620s.Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive as editor, with contributions by Pieter Biesboer, Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S.

He was the younger brother of Prince Miloš Obrenović I of Serbia, the founder of the Obrenović dynasty. Early life Jevrem's mother Višnja Urošević (d. 1817) was married twice, first to Obren Martinović, with whom she had three children. After the death of Obren, she married a poor widower, Teodor Mihailović, in the village of Dobrinja. Višnja and Teodor had three sons: Miloš, Jovan and Jevrem. Both Višnja and Teodor's ancestors were migrants from Herzegovina, having arrived in the late 17th or early 18th century. Teodor Mihailović died in 1802, leaving the family in poverty. A few years later, the older brothers, Jakov and Milan, took their mother and half- siblings to live on their estate. Milan Obrenović had a great influence on the upbringing and development of his younger brothers; as evidenced by the fact that Miloš, Jovan and Jevrem took on their half-brothers surname Obrenović. Serbian Revolution Active in the Serbian independence movement from his youth, Jevrem travelled to Ostružnica to sell oxen for weapons and ammunition. He and his brother Miloš joined the First Serbian Uprising (1804–13), led by Karađorđe. Miloš conspired against Karađorđe and was involved in his assassination. During peacetime (1813–15), Jevrem lived for a while in Belgrade. Miloš led the Second Serbian Uprising that broke out in the beginning of April 1815, and Jevrem again took up arms. Sulejman-paša Skopljak, the Vizier of Belgrade, had Jevrem captured and sentenced to death, but in August 1815 Miloš and the Ottoman governor Ali Pasha agreed to have Jevrem released from prison. In 1816, Miloš made Jevrem governor of the Šabac nahija (district); and in 1817 he was sent to govern Sokol district. In 1817, Miloš concluded peace with the Ottomans and was recognized as the \\"Prince of Serbia\\" by the Ottoman Sultan, subject to tribute to the Porte. As such; Jevrem was in line to the succession to the Serbian throne behind his brother Jovan and the sons of Miloš. Later life House of Jevrem Obrenović. In 1819, he was appointed governor of Valjevo. Jevrem ruled autocratically in the districts under his governance, decisions being made only with his consent. The same year he married Tomanija Bogićević, with whom he had eight children - seven daughters (the eldest, Jelena, married Miloš's secretary Konstantin Hadija) and one son, Miloš Jevremov Obrenović. Jevrem, as the younger brother of the ruler, had numerous responsibilities. His role in the organization and work of the nascent Serbian judiciary was of paramount importance. He was instrumental in combating banditry, which was especially rampant after 1817. Applying harsh, sometimes even cruel measures, Miloš and Jevrem managed to reduce, virtually eradicate brigandage to a reasonable level. In the period from 1817 to 1835, Jevrem participated in the suppression of several rebellions, during the Russo-Turkish War his task was to prevent the transfer of Ottoman troops from Bosnia through Serbia over to the eastern front. Until 1842, Jevrem at first secretly, but later publicly, fought for power. The opposition was able to remove Miloš from power, but then Jevrem realised that his chances of being elected Prince collapsed, and therefore committed his support to Miloš's second son Mihailo Obrenović III. The town of Šabac, where Jevrem lived from 1816 until 1831, was completely modernized and \\"Europeanized\\" under Jevrem's auspices. His house, which was completed in 1824, was a multi-storey building of which \\"symmetry, architecture and beauty precedes all residences and palaces in Serbia.\\" Understanding the importance of popular education, Jevrem built schools and invited many teachers, doctors, pharmacists, and artisans to the town. Šabac also had a well-stocked pharmacy with drugs valued at 5,000 pence. The same year, Jevrem also built the town hospital, and the first barracks with four departments, which could each accommodate 60 soldiers. Jevrem headed a \\"literary circle\\" which included members archpriest Ignjat Savić, physician and writer Jovan Stejić, polymath Dimitrije P. Tirol, writer Princess Anka Obrenović and others. In 1829, he appointed Joseph Schlesinger the music teacher for his children. Schlesinger soon formed his own \\"music chapel\\" in the town. After a written order from Prince Miloš Obrenović in 1830 that the Serbian army needed military music, Schlesinger was on 1 June 1831 appointed kapellmeister of military music in Kragujevac. Jevrem hosted many of the intelligentsia of Europe, and played a significant role in raising the general cultural level in the country. His library at his residence in Šabac, with the works of La Fontaine, Schiller and others, is among the richest in Serbia. Under Jevrem's auspices, the National Library of Serbia in Belgrade was founded in 1832. After a long illness, Jevrem died at his home in Wallachia, on 9 September 1856.

It was built in 1924, and is a ten-story, nine-bay- wide, steel frame skyscraper faced in precast concrete. It originally housed the offices of textile companies, cotton brokers, and factories. The building also contained a theatre/auditorium space, a radio and television station. The Montgomery Building was the tallest building in Spartanburg until the 1950s. In 2016, a developer announced that they planned to renovate the building for mixed-use to include apartments, offices and retail. Restoration began in Spring 2017 and was completed in December 2018. History For almost a century, the Montgomery Building has been a historic structure in Spartanburg. When it was built, Spartanburg County had become one of the two largest counties in the state. By the early 1920s, textiles and railroads had made Spartanburg the Hub City, a prosperous and forward-looking community in the Carolina Piedmont. The city's business leadership recognized that the area's increasing number of professionals and businessmen needed more good quality office space. The building took its name from the Montgomery family, one of the leading families of textile entrepreneurs in the area. It was built on the site of Captain John Montgomery's home, which reflects that up to that point, North Church Street between downtown and the Wofford College campus was largely a residential area. Montgomery had founded the Spartan Mill on the north side of Spartanburg, and three of his sons wound up in different branches of the family textile business. The new 10-story building sat at the northern edge of the city's business district, on its main north-south street, Church Street. It was only a few blocks from Morgan Square, then as now the city's principal public gathering space. Most of the city's shops and business were only a few minutes’ walk from the building. In the mid-1920s, before widespread access to cars, Spartanburg was a walking city, with most of the city's 25,000 residents living within a mile or so of the central business district. When it opened in 1924, the Montgomery Building was the tallest building in the city, eclipsing the Andrews Building on Morgan Square by two stories. It held the title of tallest building until the early 1950s, and was the city's tallest commercial building until the late 1980s. (The two taller buildings were apartment buildings.) One of the building's first significant tenants was Lockwood Greene, the engineering company that built many of the area's textile mills. They were so involved with the Piedmont's textile growth that they finally moved their offices to Spartanburg. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Lockwood Greene had designed the Montgomery Building. A number of local textile companies moved their offices into the new building, including the Pacolet Manufacturing Company, which was one of the Montgomery family's companies. Local textile powerhouses Inman Mills, Arcadia Mills, and the Deering-Milliken Mills all occupied space at some point in the Montgomery Building, as did the South Carolina Cotton Manufacturers Association. The Montgomery Building was home to more than just mill engineers and mill management. In 1926, shortly after it opened, its tenants included several physicians, several attorneys, several real estate agents, and a number of life insurance companies. Other businesses included a cotton broker, the local offices of the Clinchfield Railroad, and the local offices of a coal mining and sales company. Spartanburg's Chamber of Commerce, the Community Chest, and the county tuberculosis association also had offices in the building. On the ground floor, a ladies’ clothing and hat store, a post office, and the theater were among the tenants. After 1930, South Carolina's first AM radio station, WSPA, operated out of the Montgomery Building. In the 1950s, the building was alive with activity. Some of the tenants included the Ward and Covington Travel Agency, several real estate companies, several life insurance companies, several attorneys, the Harwood Beebe Civil Engineering firm, and some physicians and dentists. Future governor Donald Russell had his law office on the 8th floor. The Spartanburg County Foundation also occupied space on the 4th floor. The ground floor housed a pharmacy, a flower shop, a barber shop, and a beauty salon, among other shops. Several government offices had space in the building. The US Department of Agriculture took up large parts of several floors, with its Soil Conservation Service and related offices. The Department of Labor had offices there, as did the South Carolina Tax Commission. Truly, this was the premier office space in the community. Even in the mid-1960s, the building remained relatively full, with the same complement of insurance agents, physicians, dentists, and real estate agents. Many of the city's leading attorneys (one of whom was the mayor in that decade) had their offices in the building, drawn no doubt to the proximity of the Spartanburg County and federal courthouses. Most of the federal government offices were gone, though Governor Donald Russell still had a law office there. Lockwood Greene had taken over the entire 10th floor, and the ground floor still had a collection of barber and beauty shops, a pharmacy, and a branch of the post office. A local labor union also had an office there, as did the local offices of the Clinchfield Railroad and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. View of an \\"M\\" emblem at the top of the Montgomery Building in 2013. In the decades after World War II, the city of Spartanburg continued to grow, and the community's prosperity led the city's boundaries to expand. In the years before World War II, Spartanburg had been a compact, walkable city. But the city's expansion, along with greater ownership of cars, led many Spartans to move further away from downtown. New neighborhoods on the city's east and west sides drew young families, and new shopping centers pulled attention away from the historic downtown. The neighborhoods close to downtown entered a period of steady decline. By the 1970s, the city saw a growing number of vacant buildings and storefronts around downtown. In a well-meaning but ultimately wrong decision, the city decided to brick over two blocks of Main Street, turning it into a pedestrianized Main Street Mall. That move took a struggling downtown and ended its reign as the city's premier shopping and office district. The Montgomery Building suffered to some extent along with downtown. The building's Carolina Theater, which took up much of the lower floors, closed. By 1980, the building still had a few loyal tenants. A sandwich shop, barbershop, and a few random offices occupied the ground floor, along with WFBC TV Channel 4, the Greenville NBC affiliate, which had moved its Spartanburg office into the building. Several attorneys had stayed, no doubt because access to the courthouse outweighed any desire to have newer offices. Southern Bell had taken over the top two floors, and Lockwood Greene continued to have offices on the 6th floor and in various other parts of the building. A few other professionals continued to work there. But by 1992, much of the building was vacant, with offices clustered on the first, fourth, and fifth floors. Channel 4 remained on the ground floor, and The Paper, a local weekly newspaper, had offices on the 5th floor. As late as the early 2000s, the Palmetto Conservation Foundation and the Hub City Writers Project had space in the building. Throughout its storied history, the Montgomery has stood at the crossroads not only of two major highways – both carrying US highway designation – but metaphorically, of downtown. Just blocks from Morgan Square, it continues to sit on a prominent corner within walking distance of the city's cultural center, the regional state university's business school, a new co-op grocery store, the 9-story downtown Marriott, and the courthouse. The neighborhoods near downtown have experienced their own revitalization, and downtown has seen tens of millions of dollars in investment in the past decade. Built during the early 1920s, a boom decade in Spartanburg's history, The Montgomery Building stands poised to take advantage of and contribute to a new boom decade in the early 21st century. The Montgomery Building, which remains the third tallest downtown, is still an iconic structure, reminding residents of and visitors to the city of its past successes, recent challenges, and future possibilities. =Carolina Theatre= The theatre built alongside the office building was originally called the Montgomery Theatre. Including floor seating and two balconies, the theatre seated a total of 1300 patrons. It was the largest theatre in Spartanburg, and hosted a variety of touring musicals, plays, and vaudeville acts. In 1932, the Wilby-Kincey Company took over management and renamed it the Carolina Theatre, installing a dazzling exterior marquee. In addition to stage shows, the Carolina began showing motion pictures and became the city's premier first-run movie theater. In 1956, though now primarily a movie theater, the Carolina hosted a live performance by Elvis Presley. Over the years, the Carolina underwent a series of renovations to \\"modernize\\" the interior for moviegoers. A 1970 renovation in particular removed or covered most of the theatre's original architectural details and flourishes. Soon after, the Carolina closed, as audiences now preferred to patronize suburban cinemas and multiplexes. Renovation Replica capital (right) compared to original (left). In 2016, Greenville-based developer BF Spartanburg LLC revealed its plan to renovate the historic building, which it purchased via a voluntary cleanup contract with the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control. The plan for this mixed-use project included retail and restaurant space on the ground floor, office space on the second and third floors, and 72 apartment units on the upper seven floors. Residential amenities including a fitness center and storage units were planned the basement, as well as additional office space. It was a unique renovation project in that the building's thousands of precast concrete exterior panels were replaced with replicated panels made of modern materials and fit to historic standards. The original facade panels were cast using an inferior concrete mix and flawed techniques which, over time, caused the panels to buckle and deteriorate. Molds were made from the original panels, sharpened by an artist to capture all the details, and new panels were created as exact replicas (to historic standards) using the molds. The developer began renovations on the 10-story building in early 2017 and completed the project in December 2018. The Carolina Theatre was not part of the renovation project completed in 2018. However, the same developers plan to manage a restoration of the theatre in the coming years. Input from the local community will be sought to determine the end use for the theatre. The Montgomery Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Hilda Maria Käkikoski (31 January 1864 – 14 November 1912) was a Finnish politician, writer and schoolteacher. She was one of the first nineteen women elected to Finnish parliament in 1907. Life and career Käkikoski was born Hilda Maria Sjöström in Lapinjärvi in 1864. She was described as a tomboyish child growing up in the countryside. She moved to Helsinki by herself at the age of 14 to attend a girls' high school with a scholarship. There, she cut her hair short and changed her Swedish surname to Käkikoski, the Finnish surname of her neighbours. After finishing school, she worked as a home tutor until 1888 when she enrolled in university; she completed a PhD in Finnish and Nordic history in 1895. She went on to become a teacher at a Helsinki school, teaching classes in history and the Finnish language from 1891 until 1902. Her students found her fascinating due to her unconventional habits and interests, such as being a vegetarian, gymnast, cyclist, wearing masculine clothing and having an assertive demeanor. As Käkikoski developed an interest in feminism and women's suffrage, she became an active member of the Finnish Women's Association, and wrote numerous articles for the association's magazine. She was elected its vice president in 1895 and held the position until 1904. In 1907, she ran for election with the conservative Finnish Party to the newly established Parliament of Finland; the 1907 election marked the first that women were able to vote and be voted in. Käkikoski won the vote in her district, Uusimaa, and became one of the first 19 women elected to parliament. She did not stand for re-election in 1910 due to health problems. Käkikoski's literary work included children's songs, poetry and short stories. In 1902, she began writing a four-volume account of Finnish history. She continued working on the project until her death in 1912, but the work was never completed. Personal life With a group of other Finnish teachers, 1891. Käkikoski is sitting on a table at the far right; her partner Fanny Pajula is standing, 4th from left. Käkikoski was a lesbian. One of her early relationships was with schoolteacher and activist Fanny Pajula, with whom she lived for six years until 1895. Later in life, Käkikoski was romantically involved with her married friend Hildi Ennola, her American friend Frances Weiss, deaconess Hanna Masalin, and political activist Helmi Kivalo; Käkikoski maintained involvement in all of these relationships until her death in 1912. Käkikoski is buried alongside Ennola at Karjalohja, Finland. A statue honouring her can be found in Porlammi.

Redevelopment From 2014 to 2017, the mill complex underwent a $60 million redevelopment, making it the largest historic renovation project in South Carolina's history. In 2016, Charlotte-based TMS Development completed a $35 million renovation of the spinning and weaving buildings into 289 apartments as the first phase of the project, known as Drayton Mills Lofts. In addition to apartments, Drayton Mills Lofts includes several common areas, a fitness center, an outdoor pool, and artwork made from repurposed textile equipment throughout the interior of the two buildings. In 2017, Montgomery Development Group completed a second phase of redevelopment of the warehouses and company store into 60,000-square- feet of commercial space, known as Drayton Mills Marketplace. As of summer 2017, two restaurants, a coffee shop, a fitness studio and a corporate office have opened or announced leases. The developer hopes to attract additional, similar tenants to the Marketplace as part of their vision for a live-work- play community. A 2-mile long, public, paved multi-use trail connecting the mill to nearby Mary Black Hospital was completed in 2015. There are plans to connect the trail to others in Spartanburg as part of a larger system of greenways that will eventually span 21 miles.

It is the first modern low-floor tramway system service that has been taken out of service.  History  Vélez-Málaga trams operating in Sydney Construction began in 2003, with the service opening on 11 October 2006. The tram line was not connected through to the city center of Vélez-Málaga – passengers had to switch in the outskirts to a bus line. At the same time, the direct bus service from Torre del Mar to the city center of Vélez-Málaga was kept. As a consequence the ridership fell from 890,000 passengers in 2007 to 676,000 in 2011. Construction on an extension of (from the northern terminus, Parque Jurado Lorca station, to Esplanada de la Estaciónto in the Vélez-Málaga city center) began during 2008, but upon its completion the tram operator took its chance to ask for a higher support from the city treasury for the operational costs of the system. The city officials declined, and so the extension was never put into service – and with the elections in 2011 the Partido Popular came into power which chose to decline paying for the costs of the tramway system. Closure of the system was achieved on 4 June 2012 with an initially temporary shutdown of the tram line. The line has not operated since June 2012. There are plans and a €2m budget to reactivate the line, plans to extend the service west along the coast to Rincón de la Victoria where it would connect to the future Line 3 of the Málaga Metro and will follow the route of the old N-340 road.  Rolling Stock  Services on the line were operated by three Urbos 2 trams. These were transferred to the light rail network in Sydney, Australia, entering service in March 2014. Following the introduction of new Urbos 3 trams in Sydney, they were withdrawn from service in July 2015 and intended to be returned to Spain later that year. For the reopening of the line in 2017 the Vélez-Málaga town hall considered buying smaller models.

The population descend primarily from blacks who arrived in Bermuda during the Seventeenth Century as indentured servants or slaves.  History  The first influx of blacks in any numbers came in the mid-Seventeenth Century, when free blacks, most presumably Spanish-speaking Catholics, chose to immigrate to the Bermuda from former Spanish West Indian colonies that were captured by England and incorporated into its growing empire. As with most of the white settlers, few could afford the cost of their transport and so arrived as indentured servants. The continued reliance upon indentured servitude until the dissolution of the Somers Isles Company in 1684 meant that Bermuda's economy did not come to rely on slavery during the 17th Century. Black and Native American slaves continued to trickle in Bermuda, however, due to privateers using the colony as a base of operations. Black and Native American slaves captured aboard enemy ships were considered property, and returned to Bermuda for sale along with ships and cargoes. Bermuda was also used as a dumping ground for peoples ethnically-cleansed from their homelands by the expanse of the English Empire. This included particularly Algonquian peoples from New England, such as Pequots and Wampanoags, and native Irish Gaels, following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. All of these peoples were shipped to Bermuda and sold into bondage. Whites (excluding the Irish) remained the majority in Bermuda at the end of the Seventeenth Century. Although fears of blacks and Irish especially led to the discouragement of black immigration, the prohibition of the importation of Irish, and continual efforts to encourage slave-owners to export their slaves and free non-whites to emigrate or risk enslavement, the blacks, Irish, Native Americans, and some part of the white Anglos merged into a single demographic during the course of the Eighteenth Century which was known as coloured (anyone who was not entirely white). Intermarriage and extramarital relationships between the coloured and white populations continued to shift the ratio of coloured to white Bermudians as a child of a coloured and a white parent was generally considered coloured. By the 19th century the coloured population surpassed the white population and became Bermuda's largest ethnic group. As in the United States and Britain, the term \\"coloured\\" came to be seen as offensive in Bermuda by the mid- Twentieth Century and fell out of official use. It has been replaced by the terms \\"Black\\" and sometimes \\"African-Bermudian\\". The small numbers of Asians and other non-African minorities in Bermuda had always been included in the \\"coloured\\" demographic, but are now listed separately. Although the majority of Bermuda's ancestry doubtless remains European, given that all but a negligible few black Bermudians have European ancestry and that Portuguese immigration since the 1840s has contributed to 10% of the current population (although Portuguese have historically been defined as a separate racial demographic group from both white and coloured Bermudians), but with only those of entirely-European extraction being considered white and anyone with any black ancestry considered black, and with considerable black immigration from the West Indies during the course of the 20th Century, blacks have remained in the majority since the 19th Century. Currently, the majority of Bermuda's ethnic make-up is black, accounting for 54% of the territory's population.

Political career Bere was elected unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament for Tiverton, at the 1690 English general election. He presented a petition to Parliament from Tiverton on 8 January 1692 complaining about Irish woollen manufacture, which was taking away many Devon workers. He was returned unopposed again for Tiverton at the 1695 English general election and signed the Association in February 1696 and voted tofix the price of guineas at 22 shillings in March. He was returned unopposed at the 1698 English general election, at the two general elections of 1701 and at the 1702 English general election, being involved mainly in small private bills. At the 1705 English general election, he was again returned unopposed as a Whig and voted for the Court candidate for speaker on 25 October 1705. After supporting the Court over the ‘place clause’ of the regency bill, he was appointed Commissioner for victualling the navy in 1706, holding the post for the rest of his life. He was returned unopposed as a Whig at the 1708 British general election and voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710.

Mean sea level was 4–6 m higher than at present, following reductions of the Greenland ice sheet. Fossil reef proxies indicate sea level fluctuations of up to 10 m around the mean. Based on the data obtained from stable oxygen isotopes of planktonic foraminifera and age constraints from corals, estimates suggest average rates of sea-level rise of 1.6 m per century. The findings are important to understand current climate change, because global mean temperatures during MIS-5e were similar to the projected climate change today. A 2015 study by sea level rise experts concluded that based on MIS 5e data, sea level rise could accelerate in the coming decades, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years. The study abstract explains: A 2018 study based on cave formations in the Mediterranean Sea found sea level rise of up to 6 meters, noting \\"The results suggest that if the pre-industrial temperature will be surpassed by 1.5 to 2°C, sea level will respond and rise 2 to 6 meters (7 to 20 feet) above present sea level.\\" Evidence from Bahamas and Bermuda suggest powerful storm activity at the time, strong enough for wave- transported megaboulders, lowland chevron storm ridges, and wave runup deposits. =Other sub-stages= The Eemian was followed by a sharp decline in temperature around 116,000 years ago and the warmer MIS 5c,from around 100,000 years ago, probably the period known as the Chelford Interstadial in Britain.

Abusing the power to make her life perfect, Katie ends up creating more problems for herself. Plot summary The “immaculately printed instruction card” Katie finds in her drawer. Katie is the founding owner of a popular restaurant named Seconds. Katie inhabits a room in Seconds and is woken up one night by a mysterious, white-haired girl named Lis, who gives Katie a notepad, a single mushroom, and instructions for her to follow to cast a \\"do-over\\" spell in order to fix her past mistakes. Katie finds more mushrooms under the floorboard in the restaurant and uses them to fix problems arising with the construction of a brand new restaurant, her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, and to prevent the injury of a waitress named Hazel. Despite Lis' rule of one mushroom per person, Katie ignores Lis' concerns and seeks to use the mushrooms to make her life perfect, but unintentionally creates more problems as a result and disrupts the balance of time and space. Characters Katie is the main character and founder of the restaurant, Seconds. She wants to open up a new restaurant with her business partner, Arthur. However, she gets into quite the predicament when she gains the ability to rewrite the past. Lis is the house spirit that haunts Seconds. She is the owner of the mushrooms that can rewrite the past and also the one who introduced Katie to these mushrooms; even though she only gave Katie one. Lis wears the outfits that Hazel leaves at Seconds to keep her happy. Arthur is Katie's new business partner who wants to open up a new restaurant, called Katie's, with her. Max is Katie's ex-boyfriend that broke up with her when she didn't tell him about the new restaurant she wanted. They met when Max was working in the kitchen of Seconds. He eventually gets back together with her unknowingly due to Katie and the mushrooms. Hazel is a shy waitress that becomes close to Katie after she has an accident in which she burns her arms. However, Katie makes the accident not happen with the mushrooms. She lives with her grandmother and shops at thrift shops. It is revealed that Hazel leaves gifts for the house spirit, Lis, in order to keep her happy.  Reception  Seconds received positive reviews.

All of the three essays in the work were published by the New Left Review between 1984 and 1987. The book engages with a number of different aspects of Communism in Britain, for example the way in which the party was organised on a top-down basis that was founded upon direction by the Comintern and that had elements of the Leninist idea of a 'vanguard party' centred on a small group of professional revolutionaries. The book also examines the state of left-wing politics in the UK in the challenging environment of the Thatcherite 1980s and, in the case of the British Communist party of the time, the way in which it was divided between an 'old guard' faction and the younger forces aligned around Marxism Today at the time.

It has a widespread distribution down the coast of Eastern Africa from Kenya to South Africa. It ranges from dense forest to riverine forest and forest edges. In the forest it typically lives in the subcanopy at between 8–30 m. The green malkoha feeds primarily on insects, particularly caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets; it will also take frogs, slugs, fruit, seeds and leaves. It moves through the tangled vegetation with a series of small hops, snatching prey as it travels. It will accompany other birds and squirrels, taking the insects flushed by them. Unlike some other cuckoos the green malkoha is not a brood parasite, instead it cares for its own young. Breeding behaviour has been observed. The male and female face each other, first wagging their tails from side to side, then spreading them. The male also engages in gift giving, presenting the female with prey, then mounting her and feeding her while mounted. Two white and creamy eggs are laid in a nest that is a rough mass of sticks suspended around 2–5 m above the ground. Both parents care for the young. The green malkoha is an uncommon species and rarely observed due to its secretive behaviour. However it is not considered threatened, and is listed as least concern by the IUCN.

Shuja'iyya, with 92,000 people in 6 sq-kilometres, is one of the most densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip. According to the IDF, it had become a \\"terrorist fortress\\", that between 8 and 20 of July had fired over 140 rockets into Israel after the outbreak of hostilities. The casualty figures are not known with precision, also because bodies were recovered much later, and people died of injuries afterwards. The UN Protection Cluster states that between the 19-20th, 55 civilians, including 19 children and 14 women, were killed as a result of the IDF's actions. At the time they varied from 66 to about 120 Palestinians killed, with a third of them women and children, and at least 288 wounded. The UN figures of Palestinian casualties are preliminary and subject to revision. 13 Israeli soldiers were killed. On 16 July, Israeli forces by means of leaflets, loudspeaker announcements, telephone calls, text messages and radio messages, told the residents to leave and relocate in central Gaza City until further notice. Residents interviewed afterwards by The Independent claimed lack of safe refuges and the difficulty of fleeing as reasons for staying put. By 19 July, OCHA reported that while the majority ignored the warnings and had not left their homes, up to half had gone as bombardments intensified. Israel condemned Hamas for using \\"human shields\\". According to Amnesty International, the UNRWA shelter facilities were overflowing and many of the residents had nowhere to go. Residents interviewed later also cited confusion due of lack of electricity and communications. The official Israeli view was that Hamas had compelled residents of Shujai'iya to stay behind in the face of IDF warnings to evacuate prior to the IDF assault, holding civilians as \\"hostages\\".Harriet Sherwood,\\"There is nowhere else for them to go\\", Guardian.com, 20 July 2014; \\"[d]ispatches from the ground have presented complex reasons why some residents did not evacuate from Shujai'iya and other areas targeted by the IDF. Many said nowhere in Gaza was safe, so they saw little point in abandoning their homes.\\" Jordanian-Palestinian politician Mudar Zahran wrote that a Gaza medical worker had told him \\"Hamas militants blocked exits, shot people as they were running and forced the rest to return to their homes and get bombed\\". The assault on Shuja'iyya, involving a combination of F-16, tank and mortar fire, began at 11 pm on 19 July. Initially the attack, led by the Golani Brigade, encountered little resistance, until late on Saturday Hamas units, emerged from tunnels, engaged and put up stiff resistance, surprising the Israelis with their tenacity and effectiveness in taking on armoured units. According to Israeli military and intelligence sources, Israel then made use of heavy aerial bombardment and artillery fire, in what was described as a \\"risky and unusual step to save Israeli soldiers' lives\\" and \\"a battle against the hub of Hamas' terror infrastructure, primarily the so-called 'terror tunnels'\\". Palestinians attempting to flee the area described the scene as a \\"massacre\\", as did Mahmoud Abbas, Richard Falk, Norwegian physician Dr. Mads Gilbert and journalist Sharif Abdel Kouddous in The Nation. The conclusion of U.S. military experts interviewed by Mark Perry was that the IDF did not target Hamas sites specifically, simply to collapse Hamas tunnels, but rather laid down a \\"walking barrage\\" to \\"crater the neighbourhood\\" instead of using suppressive fire to protect their forward troops, a strategy they deemed \\"indefensible\\". The operation was condemned internationally, with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon calling it an \\"atrocious action\\" and the European Union stating that it \\"is particularly appalled by the human cost of the Israeli military operation in Shuja'iyya\\", while also criticising Hamas calls for using \\"human shields\\". Build up On Wednesday 16 July, Israeli forces dropped leaflets and delivered warnings by phone and text that residents in the Zeitoun and Shujai'iya areas of Gaza City should evacuate ahead of planned strikes. Hamas had told the civilians to stay put, which were prompted by fears of psychological warfare and perhaps a desire to avoid panic. On Thursday Israel began what it thought of as a limited operation, involving the Nahal, Paratrooper and Givati Brigades, in the Shuja'iyya area's sparsely populated eastern periphery, intent on uncovering Hamas's tunnel system. In the face of stiff resistance over the following two days, the probing advance developed into a full-scale battle in Shuja'iyya and the surrounding areas, as the IDF suffered upwards of 56 casualties. In Ben White's reconstruction of the background, 'Premeditated murder: the Shuja'iyya massacre and Israeli criminality,' Middle East Monitor, 22 July 2014. the day after flyers were dropped, Yedioth Ahronoth's military analyst, Alex Fishman noted that an order had been given to the tank units advancing the assault \\"to open fire at anything that moved,\\"Harriet Sherwood, Peter Beaumont, Ian Black, 'Gaza conflict: Palestinian death toll reaches 274 amid fierce fighting,' The Guardian 18 July 2014. and a military spokesman declared that Israel was \\"taking off the gloves\\" in Shuja'iyya.Anshel Pfeffer, 'In Gaza, a war of two narratives,' Haaretz 22 July 2014.

A local Gazan woman, returning to the ruins of her home in the neighbourhood, made the same comparison.Daniel Siryoti and Lilach Shoval,\\"Shujaiyya has turned into Dahiye\\", Israel Hayom, 27 July 2014: \\"On Saturday, residents tried to salvage what they could from destroyed buildings. 'Shujaiyya has turned to Dahiye. Where will return to? We had house with more than 20 family members in it. The house was completely destroyed', one Shujaiyya resident said.\\" As a result of the onslaught 670 buildings in Shuja'iyya were completely destroyed, 608 were severely damaged, 576 moderately damaged, and over 1800 buildings were affected. Battle Shuja'iyya is a densely populated area of the city with 92,000 residents according to Amnesty International. The UNRWA shelter facilities were overflowing and many of the residents had nowhere to go.'Israel/Gaza: Attacks on medical facilities and civilians add to war crime allegations,' Amnesty International 21 July 2014. According to Israeli sources the area had been designed by Hamas, houses had tunnels to hide weapons and combatants and that 10% of rocket attacks had been done from within Shuja'iyya. The assault on Shuja'iyya, involving a combination of F-16, tank and mortar fire, began at 11 pm on 19 July. According to the IDF, 15 Hamas fighters were killed in the preemptive bombardment.http://www.kikar.co.il/%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%95-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%98%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D.html After midnight, on Sunday, 20 July, Israeli forces entered the neighbourhood, stating that over 140 rockets had been fired at Israel from the neighborhood since 8 July. Flyers had been dropped over the neighbourhood, urging residents to flee. Some families, such as that of Khalil Atash, spoke of being alerted in Arabic by the IDF to evacuate, but dismissed the message as a prank. Fleeing, as did his son, Tamar and his family and neighbours, was difficult since Israel had destroyed all the electricity towers and the area was shrouded in darkness which had to be traversed under withering fire by the use of cellphone flashlights. Initially the attack, led by the Golani Brigade, encountered little resistance, until late on Saturday when forward elements of the Israeli force met Hamas units, and fierce fighting broke out as Hamas fighters emerged from tunnels and bunkers to engage the Israelis, employing sniper fire and dozens of anti-tank missiles, surprising the Israelis with their capacity to take on armored units. Fierce fighting that lasted into Sunday morning ensued as IDF forces battled Hamas squads, sniper units and teams carrying anti-tank rockets, rocket-propelled grenades, and automatic weapons. Some Israeli formations were pinned down in heavy fighting in the neighborhood's streets and alleys. On 20 July, beginning in the early morning hours, the IDF suffered 13 fatalities, beginning with an attack on an IDF M113 armored personnel carrier in Shuja'iyya. The APC had stalled while driving through one of the neighborhood's narrow streets. A soldier and officer then exited the vehicle to fix the problem. Shortly after 1 AM, Hamas fighters fired an RPG-29 anti-tank rocket at the APC, causing it to explode and burst into flames. All 7 soldiers inside the vehicle, who were from the Golani Brigade, were killed while the soldier and officer who had exited it survived the attack. Following the attack, an Israeli drone recorded infrared images of five people near the armored vehicle. Golani Brigade commanders then ordered other soldiers in the field to converge on the APC and recover the remains of soldiers inside the vehicle. However, the soldiers were wary of approaching the APC, fearing that weaponry inside could set off a secondary explosion. Soldiers reported hearing shouting in Arabic in the vicinity of the APC. The IDF concluded that Hamas fighters had already reached the vehicle and taken the remains of Sergeant Oron Shaul, one of the seven soldiers in the armored vehicle, by this time.http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-releases-details-on- shejaiya-battle-in-which-7-soldiers-died/ Shaul's body was not found,Harriet Sherwood, \\"Israel hits hundreds of targets in Gaza as soldier is confirmed missing\\", The Guardian, 20 July 2014. and the IDF later officially changed his status from missing in action to killed in action, although his body had not yet been recovered.\\"Family of fallen soldier Oron Shaul urges army to secure body for burial\\", Jerusalem Post, 3 August 2014. Hamas said it captured an IDF soldier it identified as Aron Shaul.\\"Hamas says it has captured Israeli soldier in Gaza\\" , Ma'an News Agency, 20 July 2014. Around twenty minutes after the attack on the APC, another Israeli soldier was killed in a firefight. By dawn, with the APC still ablaze, IDF commanders ordered engineers to tow the stricken vehicle back into Israel. During the operation, Hamas fighters targeted the rescue vehicles and engaged in battles with IDF troops as the convoy pulled back. As the APC was being towed, human remains fell out of the vehicle and the engineers, under constant threat of fire, inadvertently drove over and buried some of the remains. Hamas fighters targeted the rescue force with prepared ambushes and emerged from tunnels to attack soldiers. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire at around 6 AM, after which the IDF brought in D9 armored bulldozers to destroy Hamas positions. In one instance, some Hamas operatives were killed when an IDF D9 bulldozer destroyed the tunnel they were in. Three more Israeli soldiers were killed when an anti-tank missile hit a building where the IDF was establishing a command post, setting it on fire. Later, when Hamas scouts spotted a large part of the Israeli force, particularly heavy fire was laid down by Hamas fighters. Israeli commanders then gave the order to \\"take the gloves off\\" and \\"fire at anything that moves.\\" The Israeli infantry were ordered to go into protected Namer armored personnel carriers, and given half an hour to do so, after which Hamas positions were targeted by a fierce artillery barrage and airstrikes. Artillery fire landed within 100 meters of IDF positions, closer than the 250 meters normally considered safe. Around 600 shells were fired in a half-hour period. An IDF officer told Haaretz that troops \\"were taking fire from all sides and they couldn't neutralize the threat with all the firepower we gave them\\", leading the IDF to use its artillery in close proximity to IDF troops, a decision Haaretz described as \\"extremely risky\\" and \\"unusual\\". As Israeli artillery intensively shelled the neighborhood, Israeli Air Force planes bombed from above. Following the barrage, all Hamas firing stopped. According to the IDF, 37 Hamas fighters were killed, including several field commanders, eight squad commanders, and a company commander. An unnamed American military officer told Al Jazeera that, according to Pentagon reports of the IDF's actions, a total of 11 Israeli artillery battalions deployed 258 artillery pieces which fired around 7,000 high explosive shells into Shuja'iyya, including 4,800 shells in a 7-hour period.Mark Perry, \\"Why Israel's bombardment of Gaza neighborhood left US officers ‘stunned\\", Al Jazeera, 27 August 2014. The IDF sources reported that the tactics used prevented significant additional Israeli casualties and that the battle resulted in the IDF changing the rules of engagement to allow the use of artillery in urban areas. A paramedic at a local call centre said there were more than 200 calls for help in the period, one from virtually every house in a-Nazaz Street, a-Sha'ath Street, and al-Beltaji Street, with children's screams audible in the background. Commenting on the intensity of the firepower, perhaps due to the loss of Israeli soldiers, Tamer Atash later recalled: > \\"The F-16s were no longer up in the sky bombing us, they were flying just > above the houses. It felt like an atomic bomb with four F-16s coming one way > and another four from the opposite direction, weaving between the houses. At > this point, we realized we were not surviving. We said our last prayers, and > that was it. Because we know that when the Israelis lose one of their > soldiers they become lunatics. We just knew they had suffered something, we > could sense it.\\" Witnesses interviewed by Max Blumenthal testified observing people jumping from fourth-floor stories as flames engulfed their houses and of men stripping off clothes to cover near-naked women fleeing the scene. Several residential blocks were extensively shelled destroying dozens of houses. Palestinians attempting to flee the area described the scene as a \\"massacre\\", as did the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, Richard Falk,Richard Falk, \\"Massacre in Gaza\\", Al Jazeera, 23 July 2014; \\"When it leads to many civilian deaths on one side and few civilian casualties on the other side, then such state terror is best characterised as a massacre, epitomised by the high civilian death toll on 20 July in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujayea where a crowded residential district was repeatedly shelled by heavy IDF artillery.\\" Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert\\"'A real massacre': Norwegian doctor at Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital during bombardment\\", Zeinab El-Gundy, Ahram.org.eg, 20 July 2014. and journalist Sharif Abdel Kouddous in The Nation. Hundreds of civilians were injured during the unpredictable combination of artillery shelling and airstrikes overnight and only began to leave the area at dawn, many to seek refuge at the Al-Shifa Hospital.Max Blumenthal, \\"Gruesome tales surface of Israeli massacres against families in Gaza's Shujaiya neighborhood\\", Mondoweiss, 18 August 2014.'Survivors of Shujaiyya assault recount horrors at Shifa hospital\\", Ma'an News Agency, 20 July 2014; \\"One survivor said that the shells started falling on people's homes on Saturday evening, but because people had nowhere else to go they stayed put.

[H]er husband Hamad Mansour said that the shelling was not as intense at sundown, 'but with dawn, the random shelling began. Hundreds of shells hit homes, which led people to leave their houses running'.\\" Two paramedics were killed during attempts to enter the area and assist the wounded, and Médecins Sans Frontières complained that its post-operative clinic in Gaza City was running at 10 to 30 percent of capacity due to the intensity of the bombing, which hindered patients from reaching the center.\\"Gaza Strip: Israel must stop bombing trapped civilians\\", Médecins Sans Frontières, 21 July 2014. The following day, the IAF dropped at least 100 one- ton bombs about 250 meters away from IDF ground troops in a broad aerial attack. Makor Rishon reported that a total of 120 one-ton bombs were used. On July 23, the IDF completed its takeover of the neighborhood.https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/1/ART2/599/869.html Although the IDF took control of the neighborhood, clashes continued. On July 26, Golani Brigade soldiers found the tunnel from which the Hamas squad that had destroyed the Israeli APC had operated from, and Israeli combat engineers subsequently blew it up.https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4550216,00.html In an attempt to further recover the remains of soldiers, the IDF sent in military tractors to sweep away a large amount of sand which could have contained remains. Incidents *Al Helo family. At 3 a.m. 2 missiles struck the 3rd floor of 3 story home of Talal Mahmoud Hamed Al Helo in Nasas Street. The family was on the 2nd floor. His brother Jihad Mahmoud Al Helo, next door, phoned to ask after them. Shortly afterwards, Johad's house was struck by two missiles and all his Al Helo family members, 11 people including 4 children (including 2 six-month old twins and 4 women), were killed. The three-story house was totally destroyed. The surviving brother said no warning had been received, unless the rocket hitting his house was a roof knocking missile. If so, he claimed, the warning was not sufficient to allow them to flee in safety. *Ayyad family. At 6.30 a.m., artillery shelling killed 11 members of the Ayyad family and relatives they were hosting, as they were leaving their home on Al Mansura Street, Shuja'iyya, as they left their home to escape the shelling. The area where their house was located had been subjected to shelling since 1 a.m., leaving the family in a state of total panic. As they made their way, some 70 metres down the road, a shell hit the house's entrance, and two follow up rounds struck the group of 11 people, which included 4 children and 5 women, one pregnant. A further 7 persons were wounded including 3 children and one woman. Ambulances could not reach them because of the continual IAF aerial bombing. One survivor said no warnings had been given: had they been messaged to that effect, the women would have been evacuated, he said. The munitions were probably 155 mm high explosive artillery shells, exploding just above ground level, the UN Commission concluded. *Al Jamal and Al Sheikh Khalil families. Israeli forces launched an attack in Baltaji Street. The Al Sheikh Khalil family stayed inside their home on the street: one witness said at 6 a.m, explosions rang outside, and mortars had struck the roof. The family relocated to the stairwell, and called the red Cross for help. When ambulances arrived, they too were hit by mortars, and the family could not exit. 6 members were killed, 2 children and 4 women, and another two children seriously wounded. Four died while waiting 6 hours for another ambulance to arrive. At 7 a.m., 47 members of the Al Jamal family fled their home in Tawfiq Street. During the assault, 4 members of the Al Jamal, 3 aged between 10 and 12 , were killed, and another 7, including 2 children and 4 women, were wounded while attempting to flee Shuja'iyya. Ceasefire Some time after dawn, a one-hour ceasefire was brokered but the International Committee of the Red Cross proved unable to evacuate those trapped in the area. According to a witness interviewed by the UNHRC, there was a 2-hour ceasefire, but the family still had to wait for 6 hours before ambulances arrived at the scene. About 7 a.m. a military medical aid ambulance was directly struck twice while trying to succor casualties. Of the 4 persons occupants - a driver, a photographer and two paramedics -two were killed, and two wounded. Two of them were killed and two injured. Israel's Golani Brigade positioned itself on the outskirts, in home east of the main Shuja'iyya mosque. According to Max Blumenthal, maps discovered later indicated the broad swathe of land where apartments were flattened beyond these houses was defined as a \\"Soccer Field\\". According to one survivor, Mohammed Fathi Al Areer, bullet casings found near the bodies of four of his brothers, one mentally disabled, who were killed in houses east of the \\"Soccer Field\\", suggested they were executed. His neighbours, the Shamaly family, stayed behind to protect their valuable retail clothing stock, and, according to a son, Hesham Naser Shamaly, his father was shot as he tried to speak to approaching soldiers in Hebrew, as was his uncle and aunt, and two cousins. His father survived, but a cousin, Salem Shamaly (22), a grocer at the local market who attempted to find missing family by returning to the neighbourhood during the two-hour ceasefire at 3:30pm that day, was shot three times, while calling out the names of family members, after crossing the imaginary red line Israeli soldiers are reported to have drawn to kill anyone coming close to their positions. He was injured by the first shot and fell to the ground, and killed when a further two shots were fired into him. The New York Times reported however that the 'gunman's' identity is unknown. The incident was caught on film by members of the International Solidarity Movement accompanying him, and posted on YouTube.Robert Mackay, \\"Middle East Palestinian Family Finds Missing Son in YouTube Video of His Shooting\\"?, The New York Times, July 22, 2014. According to a former IDF sergeant turned activist, Eran Efrati, who has stated he took testimony from three Israeli soldiers present at the scene, a sniper asked his commandant three times if it was ok to shoot Shamaly, and was given permission when the latter stepped beyond the line. The soldiers felt guilty, Efrati added, about the death of a man who had posed no threat to their lives.

Among the wounded was Colonel Ghassan Alian, the commander of the Golani Brigade. Shortly after the battle, Hamas is reported to have shot twenty civilians from Shuja'iyya for protesting against Hamas for the massive destruction inflicted on their neighborhood by the IDF. Hamas said it had executed spies in the area. Unexploded Israeli ordnance left over from the bombing exploded in late September killing a further two young men, Ayman Ziad Abu Jibba (23) and Abdullah Jibril Abu Aser (23) and wounding three in Shuja'iyya.\\"2 killed, 3 injured by unexploded Israeli ordnance in Shujaiyya\\", Ma'an News Agency, 19 September 2014. Military assessments When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was overheard sarcastically remarking on Fox News on July 20 that the operations in Shuja'iyya were \\"a hell of a pinpoint operation,” according to Mark Perry, his comments reflected U.S. military assessments of a battle in which Israel's use of 11 artillery battalions was equivalent to what the U.S. deployed for 2 divisions, or even a full corps. The only explanation for adopting the massive firepower unleashed by a mix of Soltam M-71 and Paladin M109 guns was, according to one U.S. military expert, \\"to kill a lot of people in as short a period of time as possible,” adding that, “It’s not mowing the lawn. It’s removing the topsoil.” 'Mowing the lawn' is an Israeli idiom referring to periodic operations conducted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip. Lieutenant General Robert G. Gard, Jr. noted that technically, even if 10% of the shells fired on Shuja'iyya hit close to their targets, at a minimum in the range of 700 lethal shells would have landed amidst the civilian population overnight 20–21 July. 155-mm howitzer shells have a kill radius of 164 feet. The conclusion of U.S. military experts interviewed by Perry is that the IDF did not target Hamas sites specifically, simply to collapse Hamas tunnels, but rather laid down a 'walking barrage' to 'crater the neighbourhood' instead of using suppressive fire to protect their forward troops, a strategy they deemed 'indefensible'. Accounting for the high civilian casualties as a result of a Hamas strategy of using civilians as 'human shields' was dismissed by one officers as a refusal by the IDF to assume responsibility for the consequences of the strategy adopted. According to a report by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), after Israeli soldiers came under heavy fire in Shuja'iyya on 20 July 2014, where 13 soldiers were killed, Israel was thought to have fired 600 artillery shells were fired into the densely populated neighbourhood and dropped 100 one-ton bombs. Up to 65 Palestinians were reportedly killed that day, of whom 10 were women and 13 children, and more bodies were later found under the rubble. The author of the report, Robert Perkins, said \\"Errors occur with this type of shell, it is fundamental to the way it works, but there is no margin for error in Gaza because you will hit markets, houses, and civilians, and that is what happened\\". Analysis of the UN Commission of Inquiry 2015 As a result of its investigation into the battle, part of a general inquiry into the Gaza war, the UN Commission concluded that, > there are strong indications that the IDF’s Shuja’iya operation on 19 and 20 > July was conducted in violation of the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks > and may amount to a war crimeReport of the detailed findings of the > Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, ohchr.org (United Nations > A/HRC/29/CRP.4), 22 June 2015, pp. 70-79 paragraphs 251-299. A deputy company commander in the Golani Brigade responded by saying \\"The claim that the IDF acted immorally is an untrue statement, and our situation in Shujaiyeh is the best example of this.

The theory held that given the defeat of all the communist revolutions in Europe in 1917–1923 except Russia, the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally. This turn toward national communism was a shift from the previously held position by classical Marxism that socialism must be established globally. However, proponents of the theory argue that it contradicts neither world revolution nor world communism. The theory was in opposition to Leon Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution and the earlier communist left theory of world revolution.  Background  The defeat of several proletarian revolutions in countries like Germany and Hungary ended Bolsheviks' hopes for an imminent world revolution and began promotion of socialism in one country by Joseph Stalin. In the first edition of The Foundations of Leninism (1924), Stalin was still a follower of the orthodox Marxist idea that revolution in one country is insufficient. Vladimir Lenin died in January 1924 and by the end of that year in the second edition of the book Stalin's position started to turn around as he claimed that \\"the proletariat can and must build the socialist society in one country\\". In April 1925, Nikolai Bukharin elaborated the issue in his brochure Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat? and the Soviet Union adopted socialism in one country as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article On the Issues of Leninism. 1925–1926 signaled a shift in the immediate activity of the Communist International from world revolution towards a defense of the Soviet state. This period was known up to 1928 as the Second Period, mirroring the shift in the Soviet Union from war communism to the New Economic Policy. In his 1915 article On the Slogan for a United States of Europe, Lenin had written: > Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. > Hence, the victory of socialism is possible first in several or even in one > capitalist country alone. After expropriating the capitalists and organising > their own socialist production, the victorious proletariat of that country > will arise against the rest of the world. In January 1918, Lenin wrote: > I know that there are, of course, sages who think they are very clever and > even call themselves Socialists, who assert that power should not have been > seized until the revolution had broken out in all countries. They do not > suspect that by speaking in this way they are deserting the revolution and > going over to the side of the bourgeoisie. To wait until the toiling classes > bring about a revolution on an international scale means that everybody > should stand stock-still in expectation. That is nonsense. After Lenin's death, Stalin used these quotes and others to argue that Lenin shared his view of socialism in one country. Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky vigorously criticized the theory of socialism in one country. In particular, Trotskyists often claimed and still claim that socialism in one country opposes both the basic tenets of Marxism and Lenin's particular beliefs that the final success of socialism in one country depends upon the revolution's degree of success in proletarian revolutions in the more advanced countries of Western Europe. At the Seventh Congress in March 1918, Lenin explained: > Regarded from the world-historical point of view, there would doubtlessly be > no hope of the ultimate victory of our revolution if it were to remain > alone, if there were no revolutionary movements in other countries. [...] I > repeat, our salvation from all these difficulties is an all Europe > revolution. [...] At all events, under all conceivable circumstances, if the > German revolution does not come, we are doomed. The exponents of socialism in one country contend that Stalin's theory was firmly in line with the basic tenets of Leninism in that the victory of socialism is possible in one or separate countries while other countries may continue to remain bourgeois for some time. To support this assertion, they quote Lenin, who said: > [S]ocialism cannot achieve victory simultaneously in all countries.

The defeat of all the 1917–1923 revolutions in Europe, except Russia, ended the Bolsheviks and especially Lenin's hopes for an imminent world revolution. In his 1918 Letter to American Workers, Lenin wrote: > We are banking on the inevitability of the world revolution, but this does > not mean that we are such fools as to bank on the revolution inevitably > coming on a definite and early date. In his report to the Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) which met on 6 March 1918, Lenin said: > Yes, we shall see the world revolution, but for the time being it is a very > good fairy-tale, a very beautiful fairy-tale—I quite understand children > liking beautiful fairy-tales. But I ask, is it proper for a serious > revolutionary to believe in fairy-tales? There is an element of reality in > every fairy-tale. If you told children fairy-tales in which the cock and the > cat did not converse in human language they would not be interested. In the > same way, if you tell the people that civil war will break out in Germany > and also guarantee that instead of a clash with imperialism we shall have a > field revolution on a world-wide scale, the people will say you are > deceiving them. In doing this you will be overcoming the difficulties with > which history has confronted us only in your own minds, by your own wishes. > It will be a good thing if the German proletariat is able to take action. > But have you measured it, have you discovered an instrument that will show > that the German revolution will break out on such-and-such a day? [...] If > the revolution breaks out, everything is saved. Of course! But if it does > not turn out as we desire, if it does not achieve victory tomorrow—what > then? Then the masses will say to you, you acted like gamblers—you staked > everything on a fortunate turn of events that did not take place, you proved > to be unequal to the situation that actually arose instead of the world > revolution, which will inevitably come, but which has not yet reached > maturity. With the world revolution having altogether failed to materialize, the nascent Soviet Union found itself encircled by capitalist or pre-capitalist states. According to the interpretation of Lenin's writings by the proponents of socialism in one country, Lenin laid down a long-term future course of action for the nascent Soviet state and its vanguard the R.C.P.(B.), enabling the young Soviet state needs to first start strengthening itself internally to survive. The plan was firstly based on building a close class alliance between the proletariat and the vast masses of the small peasantry (with assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry) and secondly constructing a complete socialist society in Russia whilst patiently awaiting and aiding the worldwide class struggle to first mature around the world before a mass based proletarian revolution on a worldwide scale is made possible. In his 1923 article titled Our Revolution, Lenin wrote: > You say that civilization is necessary for the building of socialism. Very > good. But why could we not first create such prerequisites of civilization > in our country by the expulsion of the landowners and the Russian > capitalists, and then start moving toward socialism? Where, in what books, > have you read that such [...] sequence of events are impermissible or > impossible? Another quote by Lenin further expounded on his ideas in his article titled On Cooperation, where he wrote: > Indeed, the power of the state over all large-scale means of production, > political power in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance of this > proletariat with the many millions of small and very small peasants, the > assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry, etc. — is this not all that > is necessary to build a complete socialist society out of cooperatives, out > of cooperatives alone, which we formerly ridiculed as huckstering and which > from a certain aspect we have the right to treat as such now, under NEP? Is > this not all that is necessary to build a complete socialist society? It is > still not the building of socialist society, but it is all that is necessary > and sufficient for it. Opponents of this interpretation, notably Leon Trotsky, have contended that the Lenin quotes adduced in support of socialism on one country are taken out of context. They argue that in the 1915 article On the Slogan for a United States of Europe the expression \\"triumph of socialism [...] possible in [...] a single capitalist country\\" in context refers only to the initial establishment of a proletarian political and economic regime and not to the eventual construction of a complete socialist society which would take generations. As for the quote from the 1923 article On Cooperation, Trotsky maintains that the passage speaking of \\"necessary and sufficient\\" prerequisites for the transition to socialism is concerned only with the \\"socio-organisational\\" and political prerequisites, but not with the \\"material-productive\\" and cultural ones which Russia still lacked.  Joseph Stalin  Stalin presented the theory of socialism in one country as a further development of Leninism based on Lenin's aforementioned quotations. In his 14 February 1938 article titled Response to Comrade Ivanov, formulated as an answer to a question of a \\"comrade Ivanov\\" mailed to Pravda newspaper, Stalin splits the question in two parts. The first side of the question is in terms of the internal relations within the Soviet Union, whether it is possible to construct the socialist society by defeating the local bourgeoisie and fostering the union of workers and peasants. Stalin quotes Lenin that \\"we have all that is necessary for the building of a complete socialist society\\" and claims that the socialist society has for the most part been indeed constructed. The second side of the question is in terms of external relations and whether the victory of the socialism is \\"final\\", i.e. whether capitalism cannot possibly be restored. Here, Stalin cites Lenin that the final victory is possible only on the international scale and only with the help of the workers of other countries. Marxist writer Isaac Deutscher traces Stalin's socialism in one country policy to the publication of The Foundations of Leninism which emphasized the policy of isolationism and economic development in opposition to Trotsky's policy of permanent revolution.  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  On the question of socialist construction in a single country, Friedrich Engels wrote: > :Will it be possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone? > No. By creating the world market, big industry has already brought all the > peoples of the Earth, and especially the civilized peoples, into such close > relation with one another that none is independent of what happens to the > others. Further, it has co-ordinated the social development of the civilized > countries to such an extent that, in all of them, bourgeoisie and > proletariat have become the decisive classes, and the struggle between them > the great struggle of the day. It follows that the communist revolution will > not merely be a national phenomenon but must take place simultaneously in > all civilized countries—that is to say, at least in England, America, > France, and Germany. It will develop in each of these countries more or less > rapidly, according as one country or the other has a more developed > industry, greater wealth, a more significant mass of productive forces. > Hence, it will go slowest and will meet most obstacles in Germany, most > rapidly and with the fewest difficulties in England. It will have a powerful > impact on the other countries of the world, and will radically alter the > course of development which they have followed up to now, while greatly > stepping up its pace. It is a universal revolution and will, accordingly, > have a universal range. : —Friedrich Engels, Principles of Communism, 1847 In 1848, Karl Marx and Engels claimed: > The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and > nationalities. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them > what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire > political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must > constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in > the bourgeois sense of the word. : —Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848 In 1882, Marx and Engels wrote: > If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in > the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common > ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist > development. : —Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, preface to the Russian edition, 1882  In popular culture  The slogan was parodied in the novel Moscow 2042, where communism in one city was built.

Its proponents refer to Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as Maoism and Maoism as Mao Zedong Thought, also referred to as Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese adaption of Marxism–Leninism. It was first formalized by the Peruvian communist party Shining Path in 1982. The synthesis of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism did not occur during the life of Mao Zedong. From the 1960s, groups that called themselves Maoist or which upheld Maoism were not unified around a common understanding of Maoism and had instead their own particular interpretations of the political, philosophical, economical and military works of Mao. Its adherents claim it to be a unified, coherent higher stage of Marxism and that it was not synthesized until the 1980s through the experience of the people's war waged by the Shining Path. This led the Shining Path to posit Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as the newest development of Marxism. Marxism–Leninism–Maoism has grown and developed significantly, serving as an animating force of revolutionary movements in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Nepal and the Philippines. It has also led to efforts being undertaken towards the constitution or reconstitution of communist parties in countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Sweden and the United States.  Components  = New Democracy = The theory of New Democracy holds that the national-bourgeois in semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries has a dual character in that although it is an exploitative capitalist force, it can also but not always side with the proletariat against colonialism, imperialism and the comprador-bourgeoisie (whose existence is due to imperialism). The role of the national-bourgeoisie as a progressive asset in the proletarian struggle to overthrow imperialism is of course never guaranteed and will eventually turn on the proletariat when the anti-imperialist situation progresses. The Balli Kombëtar in Albania in 1943 and the Kuomintang in China in the 1920s are examples of this. These national bourgeois forces temporarily allied with the proletariat of their countries (the Party of Labour of Albania and the Communist Party of China, respectively) for the overthrow of imperialism but eventually turned on the proletariat once they felt their long-term existence in the new society would be threatened. Much like the New Economic Policy in Russia, New Democracy is conceived of as a necessary (but temporary) stage for the long-term development of socialism, or in this case for the construction and consolidation of socialism in the first place. It holds that the national- bourgeois in the New Democratic stage must always be firmly under the command of the proletariat and they must be firmly dispensed with as soon as the national situation allows (in other words, when the contradiction between feudalism and the masses is no longer the primary contradiction of the nation, or when the bourgeois-democratic revolution is at a sufficiently advanced stage) for an outright dictatorship of the proletariat. = Mass line = Building on the theory of the vanguard party by Vladimir Lenin, the theory of the mass line outlines a strategy for the revolutionary leadership of the masses, consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and strengthening of the party and for the building of socialism. The mass line can be summarized by the phrase \\"from the masses, to the masses\\". It has three components or stages: # Gathering the diverse ideas of the masses. # Processing or concentrating these ideas from the perspective of revolutionary Marxism, in light of the long-term, ultimate interests of the masses (which the masses themselves may sometimes only dimly perceive) and in light of a scientific analysis of the objective situation. # Returning these concentrated ideas to the masses in the form of a political line which will actually advance the mass struggle toward revolution. These three steps should be applied over and over again, reiteratively uplifting practice and knowledge to higher and higher stages. = Law of contradiction = Marxist–Leninist–Maoists uphold Mao Zedong's philosophical works, particularly his work on dialectics in On Contradiction and on epistemology in On Practice. = Protracted people's war = People's war is strategy for revolution which holds the following tenets: * Any attempt to begin fighting with the bourgeoisie on its own terms, using the same tactics and strategies as they do would be crushed (Marxist–Leninist–Maoists cite that apart from the October Revolution every single revolutionary attempt that immediately used conventional warfare was crushed by the bourgeoisie). * It cannot be predicted when the objective conditions for revolution will exist. Thus the subjective conditions—i.e. class consciousness—must be built long in advance. * Seizure of state power generally does not happen in one fell swoop. A situation of dual power through the course of protracted people's war arises when the proletarian vanguard controls sections of the country at the same time as the bourgeoisie. * The party cannot possibly hope to lead the proletariat in a seizure of power if it itself has no military experience. Thus military experience—i.e. experience gained through actually fighting, even if on a limited scale—must be gained long in advance of a seizure of power. In addition to being a necessary development towards the dictatorship of the proletariat, dual power is invaluable in providing this military experience (along with civil knowledge, fuel for propaganda efforts, material aid for the party and the expansion and improvement of the mass line). In a joint document released in 1998, several Marxist–Leninist–Maoist communist parties affirmed the difference between the specific strategic line of protracted people's war and the more general and universally applicable people's war. Protracted people's war is identified as being a specific application of the concept of people's war to countries with a large population or majority of peasantry and involving encircling the cities from base areas of communist control in the countryside. The issue of applying people's war to fully industrialized first world nations is the subject of much debate. Many Marxist–Leninist–Maoist organizations such as the RIM and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada have put forward that much of a hypothetical people's war in the First World would take place in urban areas. = Cultural Revolution = Marxist–Leninist–Maoists draw heavily from the experiences and lessons of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution which sought to eradicate the bourgeois that arose within the vanguard party itself and to transform all aspects of the social superstructure. The catchphrase \\"class struggle continues, and is intensified, under socialism\\" is frequently used. Marxist–Leninist–Maoists hold the primacy of the relations of production over the productive forces, criticize Joseph Stalin's line that bourgeois influence under an advanced stage of socialism is primarily due to external forces (to the almost complete exclusion of internal forces) and strongly reaffirm the base-superstructure dialectic (that the conscious transformation of the base on its own is not enough, but the superstructure must also be consciously transformed).  Differences from Mao Zedong Thought  The three most notable differences between Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and Mao Zedong Thought are the following: # Marxism–Leninism–Maoism is considered to be a higher stage of Marxism–Leninism, much like Marxism–Leninism is considered a higher stage of Marxism. However, Mao Zedong Thought is considered to just be Marxism–Leninism applied to the particularities of the Chinese Revolution. # Marxism–Leninism–Maoism is considered to be universally applicable whilst aspects of Mao Zedong Thought are generally not. # Marxism–Leninism–Maoism completely rejects the Three Worlds Theory of Mao Zedong Thought, considering it part of the right-wards turn in the Communist Party of China led by Deng Xiaoping near the end of Chairman Mao's life and a deviation from Marxist–Leninist theories of imperialism.Seltzer, Robert; Silber, Irwin (July–August 1980). \\"Chairman Mao's (or Deng Xiaoping's) Theory of the Three Worlds is a Major Deviation from Marxism-Leninism\\".

Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Gonzalo Thought only rejects Deng's application.Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru. \\"International Line\\". Communist Party of Peru. Retrieved 20 January 2020. Canadian writer J. Moufawad-Paul discusses the significance of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism in his 2016 work Continuity and Rupture. Moufawad-Paul takes the commonly accepted Marxist–Leninist–Maoist perspective on the historical development of the philosophy, stating that Marxist–Leninist–Maoism as it has developed contemporaneously did not emerge until the 1980s with its synthesis by the Communist Party of Peru, colloquially known as the Shining Path.  Global influence  Perhaps the most notable international was the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM). RIM was founded in 1984 and included such organizations as the Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path and the then- Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), eventually known as the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Today, the RIM appears to be defunct or near defunct. The magazine associated with the RIM, A World to Win, has not published an issue since 2006, though A World to Win News Service still publishes regularly on the Internet. In addition, many of the one-time RIM organizations have become increasingly critical of each other and this has resulted in many public splits. = India = The Communist Party of India (Maoist) is a Marxist–Leninist–Maoist political party which aims to overthrow the government of India. It was founded on 21 September 2004 through the merger of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War and the Maoist Communist Centre of India. The merger was announced to the public on 14 October the same year. In the merger, a provisional central committee was constituted, with the erstwhile people's war leader Muppala Lakshmana Rao (alias Ganapathi) as the general secretary. It is currently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the Indian government.  Manipur  The Kangleipak Communist Party has claimed that Manipur was annexed by the Union of India under the guise of Manipur Merger Agreement of 1949. According to this Marxist–Leninist–Maoist group, the merger of Manipur with the Union of India was in blatant contradiction of relevant international law as the then king of Manipur no longer had the authority to sign the agreement following the establishment of a democratically elected government. According to the group's chairman Ibungo Ngangom, \\"the then king signed the merger instrument only under duress, or more precisely, at gunpoint and so the so-called Manipur merger agreement was null and void from the very beginning\\". The group is currently at war with the government India and its express primary goal is not only to have Manipur secede from India, but also to bring about a communist state in Manipur through the scientific socialism of Karl Marx. = Latin America = Many significant Marxist–Leninist–Maoist groups exist across Latin America, including the Communist Party of Brazil (Red Fraction), the Communist Party of Chile (Red Fraction), the Communist Party of Ecuador–Red Sun, the Maoist Organization for the Reconstitution of the Communist Party of Colombia and the Revolutionary Nucleus for the Reconstitution of the Communist Party of Mexico.  Peru  The Shining Path is a guerrilla insurgent organization in Peru. It was founded in 1928 and was reconstituted in 1978 with Abimael Guzmán as its leader. The Shining Path suffered a setback after the capture of Guzmán and much of the party leadership in 1992 as well as a takeover of the Main Regional Committee, the greater part of the People's Liberation Army and the liquidation of the main Base Areas. Nonetheless, the Shining Path continues to exist in multiple regions of Peru and continues to carry out military actions. = Nepal = The Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), a national communist party with a revolutionary background, is a follower of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism. However, the party has also developed its own guiding thought known as Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Prachanda Path which was developed taking Nepal's political, sociological and geographical constraints into consideration. The Communist Party of Nepal is another Marxist–Leninist–Maoist party in Nepal. It claims that the UCPN(M) is a revisionist organization and is continuing the people's war against the UCPN(M) government. = Philippines= In the Philippines, the Communist Party of the Philippines and its New People's Army has been waging a people's war since 1968. Its strength peaked during the dictatorial rule of Ferdinand Marcos and was the main bulk of the opposition against the dictatorship. However, it suffered setbacks and stagnancy until it carried out the Second Great Rectification Movement. It maintains nearly 100 active guerrilla fronts throughout the Philippines today and is considered by the military as the main threat to national security. = United States = The Black Panther Party was a Mao Zedong Thought-inspired political party in the United States, requiring all official members to read Mao's Little Red Book. The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA (RCP) was previously a Marxist–Leninist–Maoist political party in the United States.\\"Our Ideology is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism\\". The RCP participated in the founding conference of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement on 12 March 1984. The RCP signed the \\"Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement\\"\\"Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement\\". and supported the RIM's declaration \\"Long Live Marxism–Leninism–Maoism!\\" on 26 December 1993 which recognized \\"Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as the new, third and higher stage of Marxism\\". However, today the RCP uses the \\"New Synthesis of Communism\\" to describe its ideology, although they still call themselves Maoists.\\"What is Bob Avakian's New Synthesis?\\". Because of this, the RCP has been accused of revisionism by several Marxist–Leninist–Maoist groups such as the Communist Party of India (Maoist)\\"Against Avakianism\\". and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada.\\"Proletarians of all countries, unite! Long live the 50th anniversary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the Proletarian World Revolution! Long live Maoism!\\". The Red Guards is a Marxist–Leninist–Maoist collective of community organizers and mass workers founded in 2015.

You have nothing to lose but your chains!\\"). A variation of this phrase (\\"Workers of all lands, unite\\") is also inscribed on Marx's tombstone. The essence of the slogan is that members of the working classes throughout the world should cooperate to defeat capitalism and achieve victory in the class conflict.  Overview  In this still from the historical drama The Man with the Gun, the phrase (in pre-reform Russian orthography) is depicted on a banner in the background. Five years before The Communist Manifesto, this phrase appeared in the 1843 book The Workers' Union by Flora Tristan. The International Workingmen's Association, described by Engels as \\"the first international movement of the working class\\" was persuaded by Engels to change its motto from the League of the Just's \\"all men are brothers\\" to \\"working men of all countries, unite!\\".Lucia Pradella in 'The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics.' Edited by Ben fine and Alfredo Saad- Filho, 2012, p.178. It reflected Marx's and Engels' view of proletarian internationalism. The phrase has overlapping meanings: first, that workers should unite in unions to better push for their demands such as workplace pay and conditions;Wiktionary, entry for \\"Workers of the World\\" secondly, that workers should see beyond their various craft unions and unite against the capitalist system;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848. and thirdly, that workers of different countries have more in common with each other than workers and employers of the same country. The phrase was used by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in their publications and songsJoseph Grim Feinberg, \\"The Gifts of the IWW,\\" Against the Current 117, July–August 2005. Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, Quadrangle Books, 1969. and was a mainstay on banners in May Day demonstrations. The IWW used it when opposing World War I in both the United States and Australia.Nick Armstrong, \\"The Industrial Workers of the World,\\" Socialist Alternative, June 2005. The slogan was the Soviet Union's state motto (Пролетарии всех стран, соединяйтесь!; Proletarii vsekh stran, soyedinyaytes'!) and it appeared in the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. It also appeared on 1919 Russian SFSR banknotes (in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian and Russian), on Soviet coins from 1921 to 1934 and in most Soviet newspapers. Some socialist and communist parties continue using it. Moreover, it is often chanted during labor strikes and protests. Variations In the first Swedish translation of The Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, the translator Pehr Götrek substituted the slogan with Folkets röst, Guds röst! (i.e. Vox populi, vox Dei, or \\"The Voice of the People, the Voice of God\\"). However, later translations have included the original slogan.. libris 7639421. reprint of libris 2683080. Among Maoist-oriented groups a variation invented by Vladimir Lenin, \\"Workers and Oppressed Peoples and Nations of the World, Unite!\\", is sometimes used. This slogan was the rallying cry of the 2nd Comintern congress in 1920 and denoted the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist agenda of the Comintern.

Previous Internationals There have been several previous international workers' organisations, and the call for a Fifth International presupposes the recognition of four in particular, each of which regarded itself as the successor to the previous ones: #The \\"First International\\", known as the \\"International Workingmen's Association\\", founded in London in 1864. #The \\"Second International\\", founded in 1889 after the expulsion of Anarchists from the First International, worked until its subsequent dissolution in 1916. The Second International was a direct ancestor of the Socialist International, an international organization of mainstream social democratic political parties. #The \\"Third International\\", known as the Communist International or \\"Comintern\\", founded by Vladimir Lenin in 1919 after the failure of the Second International at the start of World War I. The group was dissolved in 1943. #The \\"Fourth International\\", founded in 1938 by Leon Trotsky in opposition to Stalinism. Trotsky considered Comintern to be irreformable and to have crossed over to counter-revolution under the control of a bureaucratic elite in the Soviet Union. Although it still exists, the fragmentation of Trotskyism has resulted in the call for a fifth international. Calls for a Fifth International In November 1938, two months after the founding congress of the Fourth International, seven members of the Spanish Workers' Party of Marxist Unification on trial in Barcelona declared their support for a \\"fighting Fifth International\\".\\"During the trial Poum defendants stressed that, while they 'admired Trotsky,' they regarded his Fourth International as too academic and favored a fighting Fifth International.\\" Foreign News: Trotskyists Liquidated Time Magazine, November 7, 1938 The Argentine Trotskyist called for a Fifth International when he broke from Trotskyism in 1941. Another call for a Fifth International was made by Lyndon LaRouche after leaving the Spartacist League in 1965. Later, a \\"Fifth International of Communists\\" was founded in 1994 by several small former Trotskyist groups around the Movement for a Socialist Future. =League for the Fifth International= L5I logo In 2003, the League for a Revolutionary Communist International called for the formation of the Fifth International \\"as soon as possible - not in the distant future but in the months and years ahead\\". The group became the League for the Fifth International (L5I), which as of 2010 has sections in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Pakistan, Sri Lanka (the Socialist Party of Sri Lanka), Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The League for the Fifth International campaigns in the European Social Forum and the international labour movement for the formation of a new International. Splinter group the Communist Workers' Group in New Zealand also argues for a Fifth International. =Venezuela= Hugo Chávez announced in 2007 that he would seek to create a new international: \\"2008 could be a good time to convoke a meeting of left parties in Latin America to organise a new international, an organisation of parties and movements of the left in Latin America and the Caribbean\\". It was reported that Bolivia's Movement for Socialism, the International Marxist Tendency, El Salvador's Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, Nicaragua's Sandinista National Liberation Front, Ecuador's PAIS Alliance, Chile's Proposal for an Alternative Society, Guatemala's New Nation Alternative, and Australia's Socialist Alliance were likely to join the new International. Representatives of the Portugal's Left Bloc, Germany's The Left, and France's Left Party expressed interest but said they would need to consult. The Communist Party of Cuba seemed to favour the proposal, but other Communist Parties were strongly opposed. The League for the Fifth International critically supported the proposal. In popular culture Poet Allen Ginsberg mentions the Fifth International in \\"Footnote to Howl,\\" the final part of his poem \\"Howl.\\" The card game Illuminati by Steve Jackson Games features the Fifth International as a “communist” and “conservative” group.

Depending on the type of government, socialism can be used as an intermediate stage to Communism. The idea that a proletarian revolution is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism; Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the working class. Thus, in the Marxist view, proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world. Leninism arguesV.I. Lenin 8th Party Congress that a communist revolution must be led by a vanguard of \\"professional revolutionaries\\", men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who can then form the nucleus of the revolutionary movement. Some Marxists disagree with the idea of a vanguard as put forth by Lenin, especially left communists. Some who continue to consider themselves Marxist–Leninists also oppose the vanguard despite disagreeing with the majority of left communism.Noam Chomsky on Revolutionary Violence, Communism and the American Left These critics insist that the entire working class—or at least a large part of it—must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build massive communist parties with very large memberships.  Communist revolutions throughout history  The following is a list of successful and unsuccessful communist revolutions throughout history. Among the lesser known revolutions, a number of borderline cases have been included which may or may not have been communist revolutions. The nature of unsuccessful revolutions is particularly contentious since one can only speculate as to the kinds of policies that would have been implemented by the revolutionaries had they achieved victory. * The creation of the short-lived Paris Commune in 1871, which was crushed within months by the French Army.Marx Third Party Address [The Paris Commune] May 1871 * While not explicitly Communist in Nature, the Easter Rising of 1916 was supported by Marxist groups such as the Irish Citizen Army. * The 1917 communist revolution in the Russian Republic, known as the October Revolution and a part of the Russian Revolution. It resulted in the victory of the Bolsheviks and the creation of Soviet Russia, the predecessor of the Soviet Union. * The German Revolution of 1918–19, led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, which ended in defeat for the communists. * The creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, led by Béla Kun, which was defeated after five months. * The creation of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919, which was defeated within a month by the German army and Freikorps. * The Mongolian Revolution of 1921 led by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which defeated the Republic of China's Mongolian puppet state and the White Guards under Baron Ungern with the help of the Russian Red Army. * The 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, known as La matanza (the slaughter), Pipil and peasant rebellion led by Farabundo Martí. * The Spanish Revolution of 1936 * The Chinese Communist Revolution was final stage of the Chinese Civil War, that resulted in the victory of the Communist Party of China in China in 1949. * The People's Liberation War in Yugoslavia waged by the Yugoslav Partisans under the command of Josip Broz Tito with Allied support against the invading forces of Nazi Germany and the Yugoslav monarchists known as the Chetniks. The victorious partisans establish the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. * The August Revolution of 1945 creating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. * The Proclamation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948, when the Soviet-backed Workers' Party of Korea, led by Kim Il-sung, announced the formation of the state of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. * The Cuban Revolution of 1959 was a nationalistic revolution led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara which overthrew former president Fulgencio Batista and instated a Marxist–Leninist socialist regime later on in Cuba. Even though Batista had been elected for his first term, he got himself into power for his second term through a coup d'état. * Les Trois Glorieuses of 1963 in Congo- Brazzaville, a successful coup d'état led by the Confédération générale aéfienne du travail and the Union de la jeunesse congolaise against Fulbert Youlou established the People's Republic of the Congo. * The Communist Party of Indonesia's support for President Sukarno, which ended when Indonesian General Suharto removed President Sukarno from power and unleashed a wave of mass killings against real or alleged communists. * The First Indochina War that resulted in the defeat of the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 1954, and brought the Communist Party of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh to power in North Vietnam. A victory followed closely by the protracted guerrilla warfare- dominated Vietnam War (1957–1975), which in turn led to the fall of Saigon and the driving-out of occupying United States military forces there, and the unification of North and South Vietnam by communist guerrilla forces into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The conflict drastically changed neighboring Laos and Cambodia. * The Laotian Civil War resulting in the victory of the communist Pathet Lao/Lao People's Revolutionary Party in Laos by 1975, eliminating a coalition government with anti-communists led to the establishment of the communist-administered Lao People's Democratic Republic. * The Maoist revolution of India happened in 1977. It was crushed by the Indian National Congress then led by Indira Gandhi. * The Malayan Emergency when the Malayan Communist Party and communist guerrillas fought against, and were defeated by, British and Malayan forces. * Maoist-styled \\"Protracted People's War\\" in the Philippines, launched by the New People's Army in 1969 and continuing at present. * The overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by Mengistu Haile Mariam who then set up one-party Marxist–Leninist rule in Ethiopia by the communist Workers' Party of Ethiopia establishing the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, until they were defeated and expelled by the socialist and Hoxhaist Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front during a subsequent civil war. * The Saur Revolution that brought the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan to power in Afghanistan. They were overthrown by the mujahideen in 1992.\\"Afghanistan’s Saur Revolution of 1978, and the U.S.-backed counterrevolution\\" Rebel Yell! Spring 2007. Retrieved 08-10-07. * The overthrow of Eric Gairy that brought the New Jewel Movement to power in Grenada from 1979 until 1983, when they were deposed by a United States-led invasion. * The Nicaraguan Revolution that overthrew the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle and brought the Sandinistas to power in Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990. * The Salvadoran Civil War, from 1980 - 1992, FMLN (mainly composed of Marxist–Leninist guerrilla groups) fought against the U.S. backed military government which suppressed the rebel movement by framing and mass murdering alleged Marxist–Leninist revolutionaries (El Mozote massacre).Maura ClarkeJean Donovan The FMLN was inspired by the ideologies of Farabundo Martí and Vladimir Lenin * The internal conflict in Peru comprised two rebellions by two different Marxist organizations. One of several groups that calls itself the Communist Party of Peru, the Shining Path, fought a bloody war beginning in 1980 with successive Peruvian governments, both democratic and authoritarian in nature, and independent paramilitaries organized by the government known as Ronda Campesina. The Shining Path attempted to enforce a particular brand of communism inspired by the beliefs of Mao Zedong, the leader of the People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1976. The Shining Path opposed any form of democracy and committed numerous human rights violations. Another organization, known as the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), named after an Incan warrior Túpac Amaru began their own rebellion in 1982. The MRTA did not adhere to Maoism like the Shining Path, claimed to be fighting for democracy, believed in a more mainstream version of communism and modeled their movement on other left-wing guerrilla groups in Latin America. The MRTA and Shining Path quickly became bitter enemies and fought one another as well as the government of Peru. During the war atrocities were committed on all sides, but mostly by the Shining Path and the Peruvian military. Fighting goes on today with a small number of Shining Path cadres, however the movement has mostly been crushed and only operates in a very remote jungle region. Since the capture of Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán, the organization has lost most of its earlier support. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was largely destroyed in 1997 after the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. * The Maoist Unified Communist Party of Nepal fought a fairly successful revolutionary war against the autocratic King of Nepal. In 2006 peace was declared, and an agreement was reached that the Maoists would join an interim government. * In India, various Maoist-oriented factions (generally called Naxalites) have waged armed struggles since the Naxalbari rebellion of 1967. Today, the most prominent Naxalite group is the Communist Party of India (Maoist). * The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) rebellion in Sri Lanka in 1971 and from 1987 to 1989. The JVP fought with Sri Lankan then government, but defeated at both two occasions. Rohana Wijeweera, leader of the JVP, was captured by the government force and summarily executed in 1989. * The Burkina Faso Revolution 1983-1987. Thomas Sankara dissolved Upper Volta and proclaimed Burkina Faso, \\"Land of Upright People\\". The revolution suppressed most of the powers held by tribal chiefs in Burkina Faso. These feudal landlords were stripped of their rights to tribute payments and forced labour as well as having their land distributed amongst the peasantry.http://www.thomassankara.net/facts-about-thomas-sankara-in-burkina- faso/?lang=en Facts about Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso]  See also  * Class conflict * Communist state * Communist society * List of left-wing rebel groups  References  Category:Revolutions by type Category:20th-century revolutions ","title":"Communist revolution"},{"id":"43349786","text":"A lisp is a speech impediment in which a person misarticulates sibilants (, , , , , , , ). These misarticulations often result in unclear speech. Types * A frontal lisp occurs when the tongue is placed anterior of the target. Interdental lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue protrudes between the front teeth and dentalised lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue just touches the front teeth.

It is also called \\"slushy ess\\" or a \\"slushy lisp\\" in part to its wet, spitty sound. The symbols for these lateralised sounds in the extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet for disordered speech are and . * A ' occurs when part or the entire air stream is directed through the nasal cavity.

In the extensions to the IPA, whistled sibilants are transcribed and . * A palatal lisp is where the speaker attempts to make a sibilant while the middle of the tongue is in contact with the soft palate, or with a posterior articulation of the sibilant. The latter may be transcribed and , and , or the like. Causes Successful treatments have shown that causes are functional rather than physical: that is, most lisps are caused by errors in tongue placement or fatness of tongue within the mouth rather than caused by any injury or congenital deformity to the mouth. The most frequently discussed of these problems is tongue thrust in which the tongue protrudes beyond the front teeth. This protrusion affects speech as well as swallowing and can lead to lisping. Ankyloglossia or tongue tie can also be responsible for lisps in children – however, it is unclear whether these deficiencies are caused by the tongue tie itself or the muscle weakness following the correction of the tongue tie. Overbites and underbites may also contribute to non lingual lisping. Temporary lisps can be caused by dental work, dental appliances such as dentures or retainers or by swollen or bruised tongues. Treatment = Frenectomy = Lisps caused by tongue tie can be treated by a dentist or otolaryngologist (ENT) with a frenectomy, or laser incision, which takes less than 10 to 15 minutes to complete. = Speech therapy = With an interdental lisp, the therapist teaches the student how to keep the tongue behind the two front incisors. One popular method of correcting articulation or lisp disorders is to isolate sounds and work on correcting the sound in isolation. The basic sound, or phoneme, is selected as a target for treatment. Typically the position of the sound within a word is considered and targeted. The sound appears in the beginning of the word, middle, or end of the word (initial, medial, or final). Take for example, correction of an \\"S\\" sound (lisp). Most likely, a speech language pathologist (SLP) would employ exercises to work on \\"Sssssss.\\" Starting practice words would most likely consist of \\"S-initial\\" words such as \\"say, sun, soap, sip, sick, said, sail.\\" According to this protocol, the SLP slowly increases the complexity of tasks (context of pronunciations) as the production of the sound improves. Examples of increased complexity could include saying words in phrases and sentences, saying longer multi syllabic words, or increasing the tempo of pronunciation. Using this method, the SLP achieves success with his/her student by targeting a sound in a phonetically consistent manner. Phonetic consistency means that a target sound is isolated at the smallest possible level (phoneme, phone, or allophone) and that the context of production must be consistent. Consistency is critical, because factors such as the position within the word, grouping with other sounds (vowels or consonants), and the complexity all may affect production. Another popular method for treating a lisp is using specially designed devices that go in the mouth to provide a tactile cue of exactly where the tongue should be positioned when saying the \\"S\\" sound. This tactile feedback has been shown to correct lisp errors twice as fast as traditional therapy. Using either or both methods, the repetition of consistent contexts allows the student to align all the necessary processes required to properly produce language; language skills (ability to formulate correct sounds in the brain: What sounds do I need to make?), motor planning (voicing and jaw and tongue movements: How do I produce the sound?), and auditory processing (receptive feedback: Was the sound produced correctly? Do I need to correct?). A student with an articulation or lisp disorder has a deficiency in one or more of these areas. To correct the deficiency, adjustments have to be made in one or more of these processes. The process to correct it is more often than not, trial and error. With so many factors, however, isolating the variables (the sound) is imperative to getting to the end result faster. A phonetically consistent treatment strategy means practicing the same thing over and over. What is practiced is consistent and does not change. The words might change, but the phoneme and its positioning is the same (say, sip, sill, soap, …). Thus, successful correction of the disorder is found in manipulating or changing the other factors involved with speech production (tongue positioning, cerebral processing, etc.). Once a successful result (speech) is achieved, then consistent practice becomes essential to reinforcing correct productions. When the difficult sound is mastered, the student will then learn to say the sound in syllables, then words, then phrases and then sentences. When a student can speak a whole sentence without lisping, attention is then focused on making correct sounds throughout natural conversation. Towards the end of the course of therapy, the student will be taught how to monitor his or her own speech, and how to correct as necessary. Speech therapy can sometimes fix the problem, but however in some cases speech therapy fails to work.

Retrieved November 22, 2013. The term referred to the Soviet-type economic planning enforced by the ruling communist parties at that particular time. From the 1960s onward, countries such as Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia began to argue that their policies represented what was realistically feasible given their level of productivity, even if it did not conform to the Marxist concept of socialism. The concept of real socialism alluded to a future highly developed socialist system. However, the lagging productivity growth and insufficient standard of living in the Comecon countries caused the phrase \\"real socialism\\" to be increasingly perceived as dishonest and unreal. The actual party claims of nomenclatory socialism began to acquire not only negative, but also sarcastic meanings. In later years and especially after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the term began to be remembered as only one thing, i.e. as a reference for Soviet-style socialism. The executive committee of the Comecon in session Definition After World War II, the terms \\"real socialism\\" or \\"really existing socialism\\" gradually became the predominating euphemisms used as self-description of the Eastern Bloc states' political and economical systems and their society models. De jure often referred to as \\"(democratic) people's republics\\", these states were ruled by a single Soviet-aligned Marxism–Leninism party, some of which were ruled autocratically and had adapted a form of planned economy and propagated socialism and/or communism as their ideology. The term \\"real (-ly existing) socialism\\" was introduced to explain the obvious gap between the propagated ideological framework and the political and economical reality faced by these states' societies. The role of the Sino-Soviet split Another aspect of the term real socialism contained elements of the Sino-Soviet split and other \\"disagreements\\", which were actually ideological gulfs, between the Soviet Union and its satellite states on one side and the People's Republic of China and the followers of a more Maoist brand of communist ideology on the other. The Soviets wished to enforce the idea that their version of socialism was \\"real\\" and the Chinese and their followers were not, precisely because the Maoist-inspired communist movement, which had grown so rapidly worldwide as a \\"radical left\\" alternative to Soviet ideas, had consistently claimed that the Soviet Union was no longer socialist and had betrayed the revolution. To counter this claim of Marxist revisionism, the Soviets defiantly claimed that their socialism was \\"real socialism\\", implying that other models of socialism were unrealistic. Soviet popular culture The term was also used in an ironical criticism. The \\"reality\\" of \\"real socialism\\" was used against it. In particular, the term became a target of numerous political jokes in the Soviet Union, the following being typical examples.Benedikt Sarnov, Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism (Наш советский новояз.

Originally a conservative, he was converted to socialism by Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and launched Britain's first left-wing political party, the Democratic Federation, later known as the Social Democratic Federation, in 1881. Although this body attracted radicals such as William Morris and George Lansbury, Hyndman was generally disliked as an authoritarian who could not unite his party. Nonetheless, Hyndman was the first author to popularise Marx's works in English.  Early life  The son of a wealthy businessman, Hyndman was born on 7 March 1842 in London. After being educated at home, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. Hyndman later recalled: > I had the ordinary education of a well-to-do boy and young man. I read > mathematics hard until I went to Cambridge, where I ought, of course, to > have read them harder, and then I gave them up altogether and devoted myself > to amusement and general literature. [...] Trinity or, for that matter, any > other college, is practically a hot-bed of reaction from the social point of > view. The young men regard all who are not technically 'gentlemen' as > 'cads,' just as the Athenians counted all who were not Greeks as barbarians. > I was a thorough-going Radical and Republican in those days — theoretically > [...] with a great admiration for John Stuart Mill, and later, I remember, I > regarded John Morley as the coming man.H. Quelch, \\"H.M. Hyndman: An > Interview,\\" The Comrade, (New York), February 1902, pg. 114. After his graduation in 1865, Hyndman studied law for two years before deciding to become a journalist. As a first-class cricketer, he represented Cambridge University, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Sussex in thirteen matches as a right-handed batsman between 1864 and 1865. In 1866, Hyndman reported on the Italian war with Austria for the Pall Mall Gazette. Hyndman was horrified by the reality of war and became violently ill after visiting the front line. Hyndman met the leaders of the Italian nationalist movement and was generally sympathetic to their cause. In 1869, Hyndman toured the world, visiting the United States, Australia and several European countries. He continued to write for the Pall Mall Gazette, where he praised the merits of British imperialism and criticised those advocating Home Rule for Ireland. Hyndman was also very hostile to the experiments in democracy that were taking place in the United States. Hyndman married Matilda Ware (c. 1846–1913) in 1876 and then Rosalind Travers (c. 1875–1923) in 1914.  Political career  Hyndman, c. 1895 Hyndman decided on a career in politics. Unable to find a party that he could fully support, he decided to stand as an independent for the constituency of Marylebone in the 1880 general election. Denounced as a Tory by William Ewart Gladstone, Hyndman gained very limited support from the electorate and withdrew from the contest, facing certain defeat. Soon after the election, Hyndman read a novel based on the life of Ferdinand Lassalle. He became fascinated with Lassalle and decided to research this romantic hero who had been killed in a duel in 1864. Discovering that Lassalle had been a socialist, sometimes a friend and sometimes an adversary of Karl Marx, Hyndman read The Communist Manifesto. Although he had doubts about some of Marx's ideas, Hyndman was greatly impressed by his analysis of capitalism. Hyndman was also greatly influenced by the book Progress and Poverty and the ideology of Henry George known today as Georgism. Hyndman decided to form Britain's first socialist political party. The Social Democratic Federation (SDF) had its first meeting on 7 June 1881. Many socialists were concerned that in the past Hyndman had been opposed to socialist ideas, but Hyndman persuaded many that he had genuinely changed his views and those who eventually joined the SDF included William Morris and Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor Marx. However, Friedrich Engels, Marx's long-term collaborator, refused to support Hyndman's venture. Hyndman wrote the first popularisation of the ideas of Karl Marx in the English language with England for All in 1881. The book was extremely successful, a fact that stoked Marx's antipathy, given the fact that he had failed to credit Marx by name in the introduction. The work was followed in 1883 by Socialism Made Plain which expounded the policies of what by then had been renamed as the SDF. They included a demand for universal suffrage and the nationalisation of the means of production and distribution. The SDF also published Justice, edited by the journalist Henry Hyde Champion. Many members of the SDF questioned Hyndman's leadership qualities. He was extremely authoritarian and tried to restrict internal debate about party policy. At an SDF meeting on 27 December 1884, the executive voted by a majority of two (10–8) that it had no confidence in Hyndman. When he refused to resign, some members, including William Morris and Eleanor Marx, left the party, forming the Socialist League. In the 1885 general election, Hyndman and Henry Hyde Champion, without consulting their colleagues, accepted £340 from the Conservatives to run parliamentary candidates in Hampstead and Kensington, the objective being to split the Liberal vote and therefore enable the Conservative candidate to win. This ploy failed and the two SDF's candidates won only a total of 59 votes. The story leaked out and the political reputation of both men suffered because they had accepted \\"Tory gold\\". During the 1880s, Hyndman was a prominent member of the Irish National Land League and the Land League of Great Britain. He took part in the unemployed demonstrations of 1887 and was put on trial for his share in the West End Riots of 1886, but he was acquitted. Hyndman was chairman at the International Socialist Congress held in London in 1896. He was pro-Boer during the second Boer War. Hyndman continued to lead the SDF and took part in the negotiations to establish the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1900. However, the SDF left the LRC when it became clear that it was deviating from the objectives he had set out. In 1911, he set up the British Socialist Party (BSP) when the SDF fused with a number of branches of the Independent Labour Party.  Political thought  Hyndman thought was influenced by John Stuart Mill and his protégé John Morley as well as Charles Dilke, Henry Fawcett and Giuseppe Mazzini, Karl Marx \\"erstwhile adversary\\" at the time of the First International. According to Hyndman, \\"Mazzini's greatness [...] was obscured for younger socialists by his 'opposition to Marx in the early days of the 'International,' and his vigorous condemnation a little later of the Paris Commune\\", insisting that \\"'Mazzini's conception of the conduct of human life' had been 'a high and noble one'\\", praising the \\"No duties without rights\\" mention in the \\"General Rules\\" that Marx composed and passed as \\"a concession Marx made to Mazzini's followers within the organisation\\". Friedrich Engels, Marx's collaborator, \\"censured Hyndman's Mazzinian moralism\\" and also accused Hyndman of \\"jingo aspiration\\". Seamus Flaherty argues that \\"Hyndman's views on the beneficence of the 'great democracies of the English speaking peoples'\\" were inspired not by Benjamin Disraeli as historians such as Mark Bevir have argued, but rather by Dilke and Mill, whom Hyndman combined their ideas \\"on the unique character of 'the Angloe-Saxon race' with Mazzini's cosmopolitan patriotism, thus constructing a nationalism fully compatible with 'a good internationalism'.Flahert, Seamus (2020). Marx, Engels and Modern British Socialism: The Social and Political Thought of H. M. Hyndman, E. B. Bax and William Morris. London: Springer Nature. pp. 29–30. . In his two volume autobiography, Hyndman spoke at length about Mazzini, even comparing him to Marx. For Vladimir Lenin, \\"that Hyndman should do so was preposterous; more astonishing still was that Hyndman should admire Mazzini\\". However, Flaherty writes that \\"when situated within its proper context, Hyndman's 'intellectual republicanism', so far from being unintelligible, is predictable, insofar as it was characteristic of mid-Victorian liberalism. Lenin's view was anachronistic. Similarly anachronistic was Lenin's complaint that Hyndman 'very poorly understood in 1880 ... the difference between a bourgeois democratic and a socialist'. For the difference was, often, not clear-cut; many socialist, including Marx, accepted the representative state. The 'association between Marx and a 'Marxist' language of revolution' was, in the main, a twentieth-century invention, which Lenin in no small part helped to create. And Max himself, moreover, allayed Hyndman's fears about the necessity of revolution in England, stating that he considered 'an English revolution not necessary, but according to historic precedents—possible\\".Flahert, Seamus (2020).

Controversy  = Antisemitism = Hyndman by Sydney Prior Hall Hyndman was an antisemite, voicing antisemitic opinions with regards to the Second Boer War and blaming \\"Jewish bankers\\" and \\"imperialist Judaism\\" as the cause of the conflict.Mcgeever, Brendan, and Satnam Virdee. \\"Antisemitism and Socialist Strategy in Europe, 1880–1917: An Introduction.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 51.3-4 (2017): 229 Hyndman charged \\"Beit, Barnato and their fellow-Jews\\" as aiming to create \\"an Anglo-Hebraic Empire in Africa stretching from Egypt to Cape Colony\\".Hirshfield.

The organizations, described as the \\"eyes and ears of the Revolution,\\" exist to promote social welfare and report on counter-revolutionary activity. As of 2010, 8.4 million Cubans of the national population of 11.2 million were registered as CDR members.Cuba's Neighborhood Watches: 50 Years of Eyes, Ears by Isabel Sanchez, Associated Press, September 27, 2010 History Following the success of the Cuban Revolution, claims of activity labeled as 'counterrevolutionary' filled Havana. There existed popular desire for some form of urban-based civil defense against sabotage particularly after the mysterious explosion of the French freighter La Coubre while dockworkers unloaded ammunitions from the ship. The final impetus for the creation of such a movement came on the evening of September 28, 1960 when bomb blasts erupted on the former steps of the Presidential Palace while Fidel Castro gave a speech. Fidel Castro subsequently declared: > “We’re going to set up a system of collective vigilance; we’re going to set > up a system of revolutionary collective vigilance. And then we shall see how > the lackeys of imperialism manage to operate in our midst. Because one thing > is sure, we have people in all parts of the city; there’s not an apartment > building in the city, not a corner, not a block, not a neighborhood, that is > not amply represented here [in the audience]. In answer to the imperialist > campaigns of aggression, we’re going to set up a system of revolutionary > collective vigilance so that everybody will know everybody else on his > block, what they do, what relationship they had with the tyranny [the > Batista government], what they believe in, what people they meet, what > activities they participate in. Because if they [the counterrevolutionaries] > think they can stand up to the people, they’re going to be tremendously > disappointed. Because we’ll confront them with a committee of revolutionary > vigilance on every block... When the masses are organized there isn’t a > single imperialist, or a lackey of the imperialists, or anybody who has sold > out to the imperialist, who can operate”. The slogan of the CDR is, \\"¡En cada barrio, Revolución!\\" (\\"In every neighborhood, Revolution!\\"). Fidel Castro proclaimed it \\"a collective system of revolutionary vigilance,\\" established \\"so that everybody knows who lives on every block, what they do on every block, what relations they have had with the tyranny, in what activities are they involved, and with whom they meet.\\"  Structure  Joining the committee is not selective; however, the top leadership of the organization is drawn from a select pool of loyalists at the discretion of Castro. The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR) is organized into several levels: block, neighborhood, municipal, provincial and national sects, with a total of over 133,000 “nuclei” or postings (like a neighborhood block) around Cuba. Each CDR subdivision has an elected president that manages his/her locale and is subordinate to the CDR president immediately above him/her. Each block president is also charged with collecting and centralizing the information about every citizen in his block, giving such information to local police, investigators for political organizations like the Union of Communist Youths or the Communist Party of Cuba or the investigators for the Department of State Security (G2). Each committee also has one responsible for Vigilance, Ideology, and Community and Service. Those tasked with vigilance write annotations on citizens, monitoring how often people go to their house and how many attend, their whereabouts, family and work history, how many packages they may be receiving or enforcing curfews. Those in charge of Ideology are tasked with spreading political material to orient the people towards the party and recording overall revolutionary moral character. Those responsible for community and service plan various activities on rest days like maintaining optimal hygienic conditions on the block. Activities CDR-Sign in Pinar del Río =Community services= Besides mobilizing society for the defense of the revolution and the triumph of socialism, the CDR also had a role in national literacy and vaccination campaigns. They maintain social hygiene by eradicating the origins of transmission for certain diseases, clean and beautify neighborhoods, schools and social place. They bring attention to the needs of children, the elderly, and the electoral process of Poder Popular. They popularly mobilized people for demonstrations for Elian Gonzalez, the “Five Heroes” spies, or Mariel Boatlift. The CDR is also vital for the National Civil Defense as they evacuate millions of people during hurricanes, they clean up destruction. Controversy CDR opponents further indict Cuba's CDR system of informants with an accompanying control of individual freedom, a breakdown of the Cuban family unit, widespread human alienation, and a pervasive interpersonal mistrust, at all levels of Cuban society. CDR defenders counter that it has important additional responsibilities beyond monitoring individual's political and moral background; these include arranging community festivals, administrating voluntary community projects, and organizing community attendance to mass rallies. Proponents further emphasize that CDRs have helped to put medical, educational, or other campaigns into national effect and that, being organized on a geographical basis, they also act as centers for many who do not work in farms or factories, and hence include a large proportion of female membership.Hugh Thomas : Cuba, the pursuit of freedom p.996 The CDRs also take an active role in vaccination campaigns, blood banks, recycling, practicing evacuations for hurricanes, and backing up the government in its fight against corruption. However, a 2006 Amnesty International report noted CDR involvement in repeated human rights violations that included verbal as well as physical violence. Critics also contend that the CDRs are a repressive tool, giving the government a heads-up about dissident activities on the micro-local level, by tattling on the non-compliant. They further identify CDRs as \\"one of the lead entities responsible for the wave of repression sweeping through Cuba\\" most recently, the brutal beatings and detention of 75 members of the Ladies in White in Havana in 2011 and 2012.WBEZ 91.5 Archy ObejasInfos at www.capitolhillcubans.com Elizardo Sánchez, a Cuban dissident, described the CDR as \\"a tool for the systematic and mass violation of human rights, for ideological and repressive discrimination.

He is particularly active among the Bedouin herders and farmers of the South Hebron Hills and against the establishment of Israeli settlements there, in what Uri Avnery describes as a protracted effort by settlers to cleanse the area of Arab villagers, in the prevention of which he has played a key role. He has been described as a \\"Ta'ayush nudnik\\", and \\"a working-class, liberal gay version of Joe the Plumber\\".: '\\"Ezra Nawi describes himself as \\"a human rights activist, gay, a Mizrahi Jew who also manages to screw the state. They just don't know how to deal with me\\".' He is regarded by some as an extreme leftist activist and troublemaker.:'Nawi . . is openly despised by settlers and generally revered by Israeli activists.':'That is not the view of the settlers. “He is a troublemaker,” asserted Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, a spokesman for Israeli settler communities in the area. “It’s true that from time to time there is a problem of some settlers coming out of their settlements to cause problems. But people like Nawi don’t want a solution. Their whole aim is to cause trouble”.' He has been charged with numerous infractions of the law, with convictions ranging from statutory rape, illegal use of a weapon and possession of drugs to assaulting two policemen,. In addition, he has also served several short stints in prison as a consequence of his activism. Defenders claim that many of the prosecutions are politically motivated. David Shulman regards him as a major obstacle to the theft of Palestinian land, and considers him an Israeli exponent of Gandhian civil disobedience.:Shulman, when asked to define what he meant in calling Nawi an exponent of non-violent protest, replied: \\"I mean the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Henry David Thoreau\\". Nawi has said that he strikes back when attacked. He came to international attention after being convicted in 2007 of participating in a riot and assaulting two police officers in connection with the demolition of Bedouin homes in the West Bank by Israeli border policemen. His trial and imprisonment spurred a world-wild protest against his treatment that elicited 20,000 signatures. In 2008, Nissim Mossek produced a film on his life, private and public, which has had mixed reviews. In 2015, an undercover pro-settler group taped him bragging that he had identified Palestinian land brokers willing to sell land to Israeli or Jewish brokers to the PA security services. Under Palestinian law, such sales are a capital offence, and Nawi claimed they would be tortured and killed. The case triggered a political backlash in Israel and there were calls for England and France to stop foreign funding of two Israeli civil rights NGOs, Ta'ayush and B'Tselem, whose members were involved in the incident. Nawi and two others were arrested, and then released and banned from the West Bank for two weeks. Early life Nawi was born in Jerusalem, one of five siblings, to a Mizrahi Jewish Iraqi family originally from Basra, which had made aliyah from Kurdistan shortly before his birth.:'I'm Mizrahi [a Jew whose family immigrated to Israel from the Arab world].':\\"El israelí Ezra Nawi, .. nació en Jerusalén en 1952, poco después de que sus padres emigrasen desde el Kurdistán iraquí,..\\" His mother gave birth to him when she was 14 years old. He was raised by a grandmother who spoke to him in Iraqi Arabic, an accent he still retains.. When Nawi was a teenager, they lived next door to Reuven Kaminer, a leading figure in Israel’s Communist Party, and Kaminer, he has reminisced, influenced his activism. As a conscript in the IDF, he served in a combat engineering unit. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where his duties included laying mines along the Suez Canal, he went abroad, travelling widely in the US and Europe, spending some time in both the UK and Ireland.. Career and political awakening Nawi became a plumber by profession. He also adopted a lifestyle that is openly gay. He developed an interest in human rights, which he says comes from his experience of \\"belonging to a despised minority\\", after meeting Irish University lecturer David Norris and forming a relationship with him in Dublin when they met at Christmas in 1975. Nawi insisted on going home with Norris after meeting him at a party - it was mutual love at first sight - and Norris found his sterile home, replete with every modern commodity but where only eggs and tea were the staple, suddenly transformed as Nawi's spicy Middle Eastern cooking suffused his Edwardian home.. Nawi mulled the idea of emigrating to Ireland; Norris helped him buy a home in Ramot. Their partnership, predominantly a mariage blanc since the physical side ended after three years,. lasted 10 years, and ultimately broke up after Nawi refused to commit, having in the meantime fallen in love with an Israeli athlete, with whom he lived for a decade. The three remained on the best of terms. His interest in human rights developed further over several years while he shared his home in Jerusalem with a West Bank Palestinian, Fuad Mussa, who feared an honour killing because of his homosexuality. Nawi was subsequently convicted on charges of allowing his partner to live illegally with him in Israel.. The difficulties they encountered acquainted him with the hardships of Arab life, and, he says, this was a turning point that led him to embrace an activist role in the West Bank in the 1980s. Friends and clients of Nawi's raised £30,000 to bail out his companion when Fuad was arrested after restrictions tightened during the Second Intifada. An appeal was made to the President of Israel, Moshe Katsav, for his release, and an ex-gratia permit was eventually given to them to allow the couple to reside together in Jerusalem. By then, however, the relationship had broken up. Nawi had in the meantime joined the Jewish-Arab human rights organization Ta'ayush, where his fluency in both Hebrew and Arabic allowed him to serve as a liaison between local Palestinians in the Hebron area and Israeli activists. According to Amiel Vardi, a classics scholar of Hebrew University and co-founder of Ta'ayush, he has an instinctive sense of relations with Palestinians which other activists, many of them Jewish intellectuals like himself, lack.. writes that his peculiar combination of qualities – gay, tradesman, Jewish yet of Arabic background, dark-skinned rather than bearing a white complexion - marks him out from the middle-class, intellectual Ashkenazis who make up much of the Israeli activist movement, and confounds all of the usual attributes on all sides. (cf.\\"Doch anders als viele seiner israelischen Mitstreiterinnen ist der offen homosexuelle Aktivist kein weißer Aschkenazi aus bildungsbürgerlichem Hause, sondern Mizrahi, Jude arabischen Ursprungs und Klempner von Beruf. Mit dieser Mischung aus Eigenschaften durchkreuzt er die gängigen Zuschreibungen auf allen Seiten.\\") He used surplus earnings from his plumbing trade to subsidize his activities, and was reputed to charge exorbitantly for his services in order to earn enough money to donate to the fallāḥīn. The book provides several historical, ecological and economic analyses of these Bedouin of the South Hebron Hills. According to Ian Buruma, his activism is more practical than political. Nawi himself says of his work, \\"(T)his is not about ideology. It is about decency\\". According to Max Blumenthal, he is widely revered by young activists as a guide and mentor in the West Bank.. Activism Nawi, one of several Israeli activists in the South Hebron hills, in addition to Nawi, cites Dolev Rahat, Dr. Amiel Vardi and Zviya Thier. but according to David Shulman, the 'real hero' of the area,. is said to have adopted the distinctive cave-dwelling Bedouin resident in this zone,. Eighty to a hundred members of these families, of the Bedouin al-Hathalin clan,. refugees from Tel Arad in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, dwell at Umm al-Khair, a village south of Hebron, 30 metres from the Israeli settlement of Carmel, Har Hebron.'Umm al-Khair and Sadat al-Tha’ala,' Ta'ayush January 28, 2012 This is one of the many khirbehs of that area. They eke out a rough livelihood pasturing their goats and sheep on rocky land purchased from its Palestinian owners in the early 1950s. They are hardscrabble farmers of desolate hills where, according to Nawi, \\"nobody else would even try to grow anything,\\" but where these Bedouin are often prevented from working the land.:'Although the settlers are invariably the spearhead of such attacks, the occupation system as a whole is geared towards dispossession. Under Israeli law, ownership of a field which is not cultivated for three years reverts to the state; Palestinian farmers have, at best, intermittent access to their lands, because of the settler attacks. Our job is to help them in the never-ending micro-struggle for each olive tree, each well, each scraggly, thorny patch on the hill.' His attachment to these people and their biblical way of life flowed, he says, from his first encounter with them. He thought their distinctive lifestyle was subject to an \\"existential danger\\" in the way their fields were burned, their grazing stock poisoned,: \\"I was attached to this community from the moment I came in contact with it, living like people in biblical times, working the land with the most primitive tools. And all of a sudden, they are in existential danger, prosecuted, having their fields burned, their wells poisoned, their elderly beaten and their land taken away from them. You can't just walk away\\". on the incident at Mufaqara, April 2, 2005. Nawi dumped the carcass of a samur weasel, a threatened species killed by the seeded poison, at the gates of the nearby Ma'on farm. their wells poisoned, or demolished, their aged beaten and their land expropriated.:'A week before I got there, poison had been sprayed on their land in an attempt to kill their goat herds. . .I only saw women scared to feed their children goat milk because they were worried it had been poisoned.' He has been assaulted by settlers while helping Palestinians harvest olives from their own olive groves. Some, fearing for their lives, will not return to their fields unless Nawi accompanies them. He sleeps overnight in their houses to deter IDF soldiers reportedly throwing rocks at dwellings after dark. He is active in many of their encampments from Bi'r al-'Id to Susia and Umm al- Kheir. His arrival on the scene when settlers attacked a Bedouin family near Twamin and stole 450 head of their sheep livestock, was sufficient, according to Rabbis for Human Rights, to cause the settlers to desist and retreat.. Nawi and this small group of activists have been described as an 'independent aid agency': 'whatever cash went into their hands was immediately translated into solving the problems of the poorest of the land.'. For the last decade he has set up summer day camps for Bedouin children, brought in projectors to show them films, and taken them on trips to Jericho where, for the first time in their life, they can have an opportunity to swim. He has introduced computer technology in these communities, installed solar panels and electricity- generating windmills with the assistance of an Israeli engineer from COMET:ME for a Palestinian refugee camp. He helps ambulances get through roadblocks and hands out cash to poor people. He has organized Ta'ayush activities which involve escorting children to school and protecting them from settlers. After a Knesset committee grilled an IDF commander on the way children were being prevented from going to school, the IDF instituted armoured personnel carriers to accompany them. Such escorts however do not apply when summer camps are conducted, and, according to Nawi, a settler quipped that while the Geneva Convention guaranteed children the right to a schooling, it says nothing about their right to summer camp. His role has drawn scorn from both the military authorities, who have detained him on numerous occasions, and from local settlers who have previously assaulted him, thrown rocks at his car at night, threatening to kill him when he intervenes.:'passing Susya on his way back to Jerusalem when he saw a light in one of the Palestinian fields. . . they were stealing another field. They had already managed to lay down several rows of plastic irrigation pipes, a clear statement of ownership in this area; when the Palestinians awoke in the morning, they would discover that the settlers’ boundary had been extended, at their expense, by another sizable chunk. Another irreparable loss. Ezra called the police in Kiryat Arba. But the settlers are tuned in to the police network—in effect, the two groups work hand in hand—so as soon as they heard the call, dozens of young settler toughs descended on Ezra, screaming curses and threatening to kill him. Then the soldiers arrived, and also a few of the Palestinians seeking to protect their field. The settlers attacked Ezra’s car with rocks and other weapons, but miraculously he wasn’t hurt.' and who have been suspected by the police of intending to assassinate him.:\\"In the last few weeks, police intelligence agents have warned him on several occasions that the settlers intend to take him out. '\\"Whoever brings his head will be very highly regarded in the settlements\\",' says attorney Yael Barda, who helps the Palestinians in the region'. He has complained of multiple forms of harassment, from repeated fines for petty traffic incidents where enforcement is otherwise loose,. to having his business audited and receiving a huge tax bill to, he suspects, having his phone monitored and being subject to vicious homophobic taunts. Some brand him ironically as \\"the saviour of the Arabs\\" whose concern for \\"unfortunate\\" Arabs extends to assisting them when they are 'stealing' what settlers consider to be state lands in the southern Hebron hills and Gush Etzion. Nawi said he does not to yield ground when settlers attack, claiming that, rather than running away as other Israeli volunteers do, he hits back. In a 2005 interview, he went on record as saying:- > The settlers have become used to seeing Israelis caving in and crumpling > when they get beaten. I don't cave in. If anyone beats me, I strike him > back. And I'm not exactly a pip-squeak. The Israeli academic David Shulman states that Nawi is non-violent and recalled in sworn testimony an incident that took place in Susya in 2005, where Nawi was subject to one such assault:- > \\"I have been through many difficult moments with him—attacks by settlers, in > particular—and I have never seen him respond to violence with violence. On > one occasion in Susia, in 2005, settlers broke a wooden pole over his head, > and he stood his ground without hitting back. I was right beside him, and I > saw it. I have witnessed such instances many times. He is committed to > nonviolent protest in every fiber of his being\\". describes the incident, > which occurred on 24 September 2005, in detail. refers to the same incident. > It took place a day after settlers from Susia had tried to drive out a local > Palestinian family off their land by poisoning their well with a dead dog. > Nawi and other Ta'ayush activists protected them as they drew water. In opposing such settler actions, which he says \\"serve the state's interests,\\" Nawi is on record as saying that, \\"I’m here to change reality . . The only Israelis these people know are settlers and soldiers. Through me they know a different Israeli\\", and states his conviction that their acts \\"are destroying Israel. We (Israelis) have to live side by side with the Palestinians as good neighbours, not as conquerors\\".:\\"Sie zerstören Israel. Wir müssen mit den Palästinensern als gute Nachbarn zusammenleben, nicht wie Eroberer\\". Mere presence can be, he maintains, a deterrence. In one particular episode in January 2003, captured by Shulman's eyewitness account in his book, Dark Hope (2007), armed settlers wearing skullcaps and tzitzit fringes, and hailing from a daughter settlement of Ma'on called Ma'on farm (Havat Ma'on), charged down on Twaneh peasants sowing their traditional fields while Nawi was present. As shots were fired their way and stones rained down on the sowers, Shulman got the impression Nawi seemed to relish the moment, as he rallied those about him with the cry, \\"Don't be afraid. Stand your ground\\".. Joseph Dana expresses a similar view. In an incident at the village of Safa, in the face of tear-gas and live ammunition, Nawi's reaction to Dana's anxiety was to smile, slap him on the back and quip: \\"quite an adventure you are experiencing!\\" His approach, Dana concluded, cuts the tension in the air. Shulman has recently argued that he is one of three exponents of Gandhi's principle of satyagraha in the West Bank, alongside Abdallah Abu Rahmah and Ali Abu Awwad, with the difference that Nawi is Jewish, and has probably, unlike the former two, never read a word of Gandhi's writings, but simply 'reinvented Gandhian-style protest on his own.'. Nawi's activism, according to Amira Hass, has brought him to the verge of bankruptcy. Legal issues =Statutory rape conviction= In 1995, Nawi was convicted of statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, after their relationship had been reported to Israeli police by the boy's parents in 1992. The legal age for such relationships is 16 in Israeli law. The statutory rape case was appealed twice. The prosecution’s case was difficult due to the length of time between the offense and the appeal process, and since the victim, one year under the legal age of consent, was reluctant to testify against Nawi. After 5 years, the High Court upheld the conviction upon final appeal. It found the relationship had been consensual, sentencing him to six months based on a plea bargain, of which he served less than three.:'The court ruled that the sexual relations were consensual and Mr Nawi served a jail term of less than three months.' In 2011 it was revealed that David Norris, the frontrunner for the position of President of Ireland at the time, had written a letter in support of Nawi on Irish Parliament letterhead, and sent it to the Israeli High Court. In the letter, Norris claimed Nawi was tricked into a plea bargain and requested a noncustodial sentence. This revelation caused him to withdraw from the presidential race. Nawi has had other convictions, including illegal use of a weapon and possession of drugs—he freely admits to smoking hash—for private use. =2004 arrest and trial= He has been charged for infractions in the West Bank several times. In the first half of 2004, the Israeli prosecution filed three suits against him. The first concerned an incident that occurred after he accompanied a convoy to a harvest at Twaneh, where he was joined by Israeli novelists Meir Shalev and David Grossman and anchorman Haim Yavin. Nawi rushed to put himself between the settlers and the harvesting fellahin to protect the latter, and a settler filed a complaint to police accusing Nawi of attacking him. In addition he was caught entering Area A, forbidden to Israelis, while bringing a consignment of clothes to people in Yatta. He was also arrested for giving a ride back into the West Bank to a Palestinian who had been residing without a permit in Israel; and he was indicted once on suspicion he had hindered a settler from filming him as he helped the Palestinians. In the last instance, his lawyer questioned the plaintiff regarding the fact he had filmed the event on Sabbath, whereupon the settler replied that he had a rabbinical ruling on halakha or Jewish law, which determined that Sabbath may be desecrated if the aim is to stop a goy from stealing hay and straw, as were the Palestinians in the area, which belonged to the settlers. Nawi was convicted by the Magistrate's court and sentenced to probation and a fine of NIS 500. It emerged that the halakhic judgement had been written by the plaintiff's father a day before the trial. On appeal, the conviction was overturned by a District Court when his lawyer Lea Tsemel showed that the land concerned was owned by Palestinians. =2007 arrest and trial= Umm al-Kheir, South Hebron Hills. On 14 February 2007, Nawi went to assist Palestinian families whose homes, several tin and canvas shanties, were about to be razed as illegal structures. According to Shulman, these Palestinians at Um al-Kheir, which lies a few meters from rows of red- roofed settler villas at Carmel, require building permits for any house construction or extensions to their tents or shacks and such permits are almost impossible to obtain since on average, in the West Bank area administered by Israel, Area C, only one is released per month by the Israeli Civil Administration for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian residents there. Palestinians with their large families regularly build without permits, and the occupation authorities regularly issue demolition orders, of which some 20 are carried out each month. reports that the Israeli NGO Bimkom calculated in 2008 that only 13 building permits were issued to Palestinians in the West Bank per year. Nawi considers such administrative actions \\"acts of war\\" since these Bedouin families lived in the area before the state of Israel came into existence. On that day, Nawi became involved in a clash with border police who had been sent to protect the bulldozers. Nawi threw himself before the bulldozers, and had to be dragged from their path to allow the demolition order to be executed. Though much of the incident was captured on video, the police testified later that, after they caught up with him inside a half- demolished shack, he raised his hands against them and resisted arrest in some 8 to 20 seconds not caught on video. According to Ben-Gurion university professor Neve Gordon, in the video Nawi is seen disarming a Palestinian woman of a rock she had picked up some minutes before the alleged assault. He was arrested, handcuffed and charged, although the assault later alleged was not included in the original police statements. The videotape shows that, handcuffed on a police truck, and taunted by the police for assisting Arabs, Nawi told them: \\"I was also a soldier, but I did not demolish houses, . . The only thing that will be left here is hatred\\". Verdict, appeal, and aftermath At his trial, judge Eilata Ziskind determined on March 19, on the basis of testimony from the two police officers, that he was guilty as charged: that he had pushed the two policemen, incited people, behaved in an unruly manner and interrupted police in the performance of their duties. The decision led to a public outcry, with some 140,000 letters, according to Nawi, being sent to Israeli officials. Television footage filming the clash had been broadcast on Israel's Channel 1. According to Neve Gordon, the verdict was made notwithstanding \\"the very clear evidence\\" captured on film. Arik Ascherman, Executive Director of Rabbis for Human Rights, enjoined people to rally with him before a Court of Appeal. Sentencing, in which he was expected to serve up to two years in jail, was originally scheduled for July 1, 2009 but subsequently postponed to September 21, 2009, after the judge had been presented with a petition organized in an international campaign conducted over the internet. In August 2009, in a preliminary hearing on sentencing the court heard several witnesses, such as Shulman and Galit Hasan-Rokem, testifying on Nawi's behalf. Aside from these academics, the former Deputy Attorney General of Israel, Yehudit Karp, speaking as a character witness and as a former head of a committee that had examined law and order issues in the West Bank, wrote that the situation there was strongly distorted in favour of the settlers, and that this justified the way Nawi, whom she called a modern- day Robin Hood, behaved in conditions she considered \\"surreal\\".:\\"the Robin Hood of the South Hebron hills\\". She took the trial as the start of a dangerous process in that root problems are not addressed, and injustices wrought on Palestinians are not met by appropriate application of relevant laws. According to Nawi, the judge instructed the court to find an interpreter to translate the sentence for Nawi's benefit, as if he, a Mizrahi Jew fluent in Hebrew, were actually a Palestinian Arab. In his own defence, given in an article in The Nation at the time, Nawi spoke of his eight years of activism in the area, and asked rhetorically: \\"was I the one who poisoned and destroyed Palestinian water wells? Was I the one who beat young Palestinian children? Did I hit the elderly? Did I poison the Palestinian residents' sheep? Did I demolish homes and destroy tractors? Did I block roads and restrict movement? Was I the one who prevented people from connecting their homes to running water and electricity? Did I forbid Palestinians from building homes?\\" He called relations between the military, civil administration, the judicial system, the police, and the Jewish settlers, whom he regards as the commanders, an \\"unholy alliance\\" where the end of securing full control of the Land of Israel justified any means. The Palestinians were dehumanized so that everything was permissible: land-theft, home-demolition, stealing water, arbitrary imprisonment, and on occasion murder. \\"In Hebrew,\\" he added, \\"we say damam mutar, taking their blood is permissible\\". Elsewhere he is on record as arguing that the function of the violence is to \\"scare the Palestinians into not moving around or using their land for farming and agriculture.\\" and that most settlers are motivated by religious ideas one cannot argue with, and that Arabs must leave. \\"They want Palestine.\\" Nawi's case elicited the attention of several prominent international figures, including Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, and Neve Gordon, who organized a campaign to protest against his imprisonment, calling him \\"one of Israel's most courageous human rights activists\\", and his arrest, conviction and pending imprisonment \\"politically motivated\\". Additionally, Yehudit Karp petitioned the court asking for clemency on the basis that the state had failed in its obligations to enforce the law against Israeli settlers in the Palestinian territories and that Nawi's actions against the settlers should be seen in that context. The group Jewish Voice for Peace presented the court with a petition signed by 20,000 people requesting clemency for Nawi. On September 21, the Jerusalem Magistrates' Court sentenced him to a term of one month in prison, and fined him NIS 750 ($202), ordering him to pay an additional NIS 500 ($135) to each officer he was found guilty of assaulting. Judge Ziskind, in her ruling, wrote that \\"even if there is a supreme goal, it cannot be used as an excuse to commit offenses\\", and that, > \\"Freedom of expression is not the freedom to incite and take actions that > prevent or disrupt police work …Freedom of expression does not allow for > riots, incitement or violence. Democracy cannot allow this, for if the law > enforcement system collapses, anarchy will reign and democracy and freedom > of expression will be no more. . .The fact that a person is acting in the > name of one ideology or another, as justified as it may be, is no excuse to > commit offenses in the name of that ideology, and in this matter there is no > difference between left-wing activists, right-wing activists, religious, > seculars, or other groups in conflict\\". He was also put on three years probation, during which, if he insulted an officer, disturbed public order, or participated in an illegal protest, he would immediately suffer a further six months imprisonment. The Yesha Human Rights Organization, representing the Yesha or settlers' perspective, criticized the brevity of the one-month sentence, asserting that, > \\"One month in jail is like mocking the poor and emphasizes the selectivity > of the law enforcement system in Judea and Samaria. (The system) allows Nawi > to run wild, cooperate with Hamas members and hurt settlers, and remembers > to enforce the law only when he hurts policemen\\". Incarcerated on Sunday, 23 May 2010, he served out his sentence at Dekel Prison, Emek Sarah, Beer-Sheva. Subsequent to this trial, Ha'aretz revealed that the prosecution had used as part of its case Nawi's prior conviction for statutory rape. The story resurfaced once more in 2011 when the Zionist and blogger John Connolly revealed that the Irish senator and presidential candidate David Norris, a former lover of Nawi's, had written a letter to the Israeli court requesting clemency for Nawi at the time. =2012 offensive language case= On June 10, 2012, Nawi was convicted of 'offending public servants' by the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court, with Judge Cjana Lomp presiding, after it was alleged that he had called a deputy battalion commander of the IDF a \\"war criminal\\" during a clash at Susya in July 2009, when he and other activists tried to prevent Jewish settlers from establishing an outpost called Givat HaDegel (Flag Hill, alternatively Chisdi Hashem The Grace of God), and thereby depriving Palestinians of their land. =2013 traffic case= Following an incident with a military jeep in the South Hebron hills in March 2013, Nawi was charged with crossing a solid white line while overtaking. He was acquitted of the charge by Judge Miriam Kaslassy who stated in her ruling that \\"It’s clear as day that we’re not talking about random enforcement of a traffic violation\\", and that the police had made Nawi commit the offence. Nawi subsequently sued the state, and was awarded 45,000 shekels compensation. The Ministry of Justice stated that the policeman and the army officer involved in the incident would be prosecuted for entrapment. =2014 traffic case= In April 2014, Nawi, together with Guy Butavia, was stopped by police, while driving out from Jerusalem towards the South Hebron hills. The police stated that Butavia was not wearing a safety belt, that Nawi's license was not in order, and that they suspected the two of trying to hide something. A tobacco pouch was seized, on the suspicion it contained drugs. The two were detained for 8 hours at a police station, and released under house arrest for three days. The day after, the order was cancelled. Despite several allegations made by the police, the case was dropped. Both Nawi and Butavia sued the police for harassment, claiming $28,125 in compensation. They further claim the incident was directed at them for being human rights activists, and that video taken at the time contradicts evidence presented by the police. In June 2019, the Jerusalem Magistrates Court found in favour of Nawi and Butavia, and ordered the police to pay them 7500 shekels in damages and compensation. Uvda Investigation 2016 In January 2016, hidden camera recordings of Nawi were broadcast by Ilana Dayan as part of the Uvda (\\"Fact\\") investigative series on Israel's Channel 2.. The report revealed Nawi bragging he had passed on to the Palestinian National Security Forces the names of Palestinian land brokers willing to sell land to Jews. In the recording, Nawi relates how Palestinian property dealers mistook him for a Jew looking to purchase land, and says, \\"Straight away I give their pictures and phone numbers to the Preventive Security Force. The Palestinian Authority catches them and kills them. But before it kills them, they get beat up a lot.”.. No reports have confirmed that Nawi's actions brought about the execution of any Palestinians,. a practice which, according to Amira Hass, the PA has long abandoned. Mahmoud Abbas said that the PA does not execute land vendors, but sentences them to hard labour.. Several unsolved murders in recent years have, however, been regarded as related to such sales. Itzik Goldway, a reserve sergeant in the IDF and decorated veteran of Operation Protective Edge, together with his girlfriend, Julia T.,. are right-wing activists from the Ad Kan (\\"Up to Here\\") NGO, an organization whose existence was unknown until the Uvda programme was broadcast. They succeeded in befriending Nawi by infiltrating Ta'ayush.. With Nawi, they observed attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers. They then made the tapes which Ad Kan passed on to Uvda. Nasser Nawaja, a Palestinian resident of Susya who has spent a lifetime defending his village from the threat of expulsion and field researcher for the Israeli human rights NGO B'Tselem,. was also present in one of the putative operations, in which the land broker purportedly tried to sell Nawi, an Israeli, land which belongs to Nawaja's own family. Nawi said that he \\"feels like crap\\" for fingering these agents by deceptive means. Nawi reacted to the report's claim that he used measures of entrapment by stating that > \\"The opposite is true. He came to me and presented himself as a land broker. > Since I assumed he was sent to frame me and tarnish my name in the > Palestinian community, I had no choice but to report the incident to the > Palestinian Authority, lest I be deemed a land buyer. I regret that the > report is part of the effort to sabotage my activities, and the activities > of my friends alongside the Palestinians.\\" The Palestinian penal code, adopting a principle from the previous Jordanian legal system, imposes a sentence of capital punishment for anyone convicted of the sale of land to Israelis,. or, according to other sources, to Jews.. The law, defended by Palestinian officials as designed to prevent takeovers by settlers, has never been officially implemented. The standard penalty imposed on those convicted of such charges amounts to several years imprisonment. Ad Kan, the day after the programme was telecast, filed a complaint with the Israeli police against Nawi and two other Ta'ayush activists, and against B'tselem's Nasser Nawaja.. On January 11, 2016, Nawi was arrested at Ben Gurion airport, after purchasing a flight ticket, on the suspicion of being an accessory to manslaughter, of conspiring in attempted murder, of contacting a foreign agent, of transporting an individual in Israel without a permit, and of using drugs. .. Subsequently, both Nasser Nawaja and a third activist Guy Butavia were arrested, denied a lawyer, with a gag order being placed on their cases as well. Butavia was released on 21 January, and Nawi remanded until 24 January. The immediate release of Nawaja was ordered by a judge, for what his lawyer called a 'false arrest', since Israel had no jurisdiction in the matter. The police transferred him to Ofer prison, in what B'tselem called a contempt of the court ruling.. On January 24 a judge ordered Nawi’s release to house arrest, and criticized the prosecution for failing to clarify the allegation that he was involved in the death of a Palestinian selling land. Nawi had tipped off relatives of a certain Abu Khalil that the latter was considering a land swap with an Israeli, Yonathan. His relatives would have been harmed by the sale. Some time afterwards, Abu Khalil died. The police failed to provide evidence on the cause of death. An appeal by the police against the lower court decision ordering his release was rejected on 25 January by the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court.. According to his lawyer, Eitan Peleg, the police failed to determine whether the putative victim was dead or not.. On the 28th of January, Judge David Shaul Gabai Richter nullified the cause for the arrest of both Butavia and Nawi, stating there was nothing in the evidence to substantiate the police's central allegation. He rejected a police appeal that Nawi be banned from the West Bank. He added that the case was part of a political controversy in which one side attacked the other. It was not the court's function, he concluded, to bother with politics.. An appeal by police against the decision,which ruled that a ban infringed their freedom of occupation and expression, was heard on 31 January, and partially overturned Richter's ruling. The police requested that the two activists be barred from the West Bank for 2 months was partially accepted when judge Moshe Bar-Am ruled reasonable suspicions exist, and that they were to be denied entry to the West Bank for two weeks.. =Responses= Both B'tselem and Ta'ayush criticized the programme for basing their investigation almost wholly on materials passed onto them by people who infiltrated Nawi's group. Rabbis for Human Rights suspended their collaboration with Nawi until hearings could clarify the circumstances. Veterans for Breaking the Silence refused to reply to inquiries by Channel 2 stating:'“We don’t work for the Stasi (East Germany’s Ministry of State Security) and we don’t reply to the Stasi inquiries. Whoever wants a Soviet bloc-style police state—good for them”.'. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented that the documentary had \\"unmasked radicals among us, whose hatred for settlements has pushed them over the edge to the point of delivering innocents for torture and execution. Those who encourage murder cannot continue to hide behind the hypocritical pretense of caring for human rights.\\" Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon linked the incident to the BDS movement and said so-called \\"peace groups\\" would even kill Palestinians in order to trash and tarnish Israel. Naftali Bennett cited the case in an attack on the bona fides of the New Israel Fund and the European Union in funding Israeli human rights activists, and called on the British and French ambassadors to stop funding both Ta'ayush and B'tselem. Yuval Diskin stated Nawi should be jailed quickly but cautioned that \\"the data shows that there is no basis for comparison between violence coming from the right and violence coming from the left.\\" B'tselem commented on its Facebook page that while opposed to tortures and executions, reporting Palestinians who intend to sell Israelis Palestinian land was “the only legitimate course of action.” Attorney Leah Tsemel, who defends Palestinian rights, said the complaint would not be difficult to deal with. Gideon Levy criticized Uvda's presentation, writing that it systematically ignored the crimes of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, and noted that Nawi was being likened to the perpetrators of the Duma arson attack.. Both Levy and Amira Hass wrote that Uvda had failed its brief as an outlet for investigative journalism by lending its services uncritically to what Levy called a McCarthyist right-wing organization about which nothing is known (Levy) or passing on a 'puff piece for a privatized, mini-Shin Bet' (Hass). They say that no background research on the sources or the contexts had been conducted. For David Shulman, Nawi's work is one of the main reasons why the civilian Palestinian population in the South Hebron hills still maintains a precarious purchase on fragments of their historic lands, and the entire episode, mounted by \\"moles\\" from a shadowy organization to discredit him has, he concludes, all the appearance of a sting operation to trap him and 'legitimize the theft of Palestinian land.' Films about Nawi Nawi's story has been recounted in two documentary films. In 2005, Canadian- Jewish filmmaker Elle Flanders made a documentary entitled Zero Degree of Separation, which intertwined the story of her family in Jerusalem, for whom Ezra Nawi once worked as a gardener, with the lives of two gay couples, one of which was Nawi and his companion... In 2007, a further film about Nawi's life and work, 'Citizen Nawi' (HaEzrach Nawi).. directed by Nissim Mossek and produced by Sharon Schaveet, premiered at the Jerusalem Film Festival, where it won a special jury mention. The film documents the plight of the Bedouin, the difficulties of Israeli-Palestinian relations, and the hardships of being gay. Made over five years on a shoe-string budget, it was judged a somewhat messy docu by Variety film critic Leslie Felperin, who thought its director \\"too in love with its subject to ask tough questions\\". Yet, he added, it managed \\"to expose both Israeli and Arab bigotry and has its heart in the right liberal place\\". Raya Morag sees the film as basically about deep-seated Israeli homophobia and racism.. Dan DiLandro, reviewing for Educational Media Reviews , wrote that the film had a number of evident problems, technical and narrative, yet judged it \\"an important work that shed light on many of the area’s conflicts and dynamics\\". Michael Fox, writing for Jweekly, finds 'Citizen Nawi' to be \\"a rough-hewn profile in courage that diligently tallies the cost of conscience\\", and writes of the \\"discomfiting power\\" of a \\"raw and occasionally wrenching film\\", which stirs a \\"certain cognitive dissonance\\" when one \\"sees Nawi threatened and insulted in the crudest terms by religious Jewish settlers and embraced as a trusted friend by a Palestinian family living in a tent\\". For Fox, as the film follows Nawi's travails with his lover, run-ins with the police, and battles with settlers, it suddenly jolts one out of the initial impression that Nawi's activism has liberal roots:- > \\"One just assumes that Nawi has always been a liberal, and that his treks to > the West Bank reflect a longstanding empathy for the Palestinians. It comes > as a shock when he remarks well into the film that he wasn't particularly > aware of or concerned about their day-to-day hardships until he got involved > with Fuad\\". Nawi's instincts, Fox concludes, are those of the humanist, and the director Mossek's gutsiest move was to have made \\"a film that doesn't aim to inspire us with platitudes but instead tries to shock us with the hard business of building a road to peace\\". Nawi's example has also influenced the Israeli film-maker Ra’anan Alexandrowicz..

World revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the conscious revolutionary action of the organized working class. For some theorists, these revolutions will not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allow a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a workers' state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as Trotskyism and Communist Left, the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country. The end goal of such internationally oriented revolutionary socialism is to achieve world socialism, and later, stateless communism.The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism by BukharinThe State and Revolution — Chapter 5 Communist movements The October Revolution of 1917 in Russia sparked a revolutionary wave of socialist and communist uprisings across Europe, most notably the German Revolution, the Hungarian Revolution, Biennio Rosso and the revolutionary war in Finland with the short lived Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic, which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also Revolutions of 1917-23. Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that capitalism would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the Comintern, founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the Russian Civil War into an essentially Soviet- sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide. With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see Socialism in one country. After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again. As fascism grew in Europe in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the Comintern opted for a Popular Front with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of World War II in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's Western allies. =After World War II= A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the aftermath of World War II, though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in a failed socialist revolution in Germany and a successful one in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as Greece, France, and Italy had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their leadership of anti-fascist resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. For Communist parties in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power. Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the Yugoslav Partisans led by the future leader of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, who had led the struggle against fascism and Axis occupation during World War II. Student and worker revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the establishment of the New Left together with the Civil Rights Movement, the militancy of the Black Panther Party and similar armed/insurrectionary \\"Liberation Front\\" groups, and even a bit of a resurgence in the labor movement for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but imminent; thus, there arose a common expression, \\"The East is Red, and the West is Ready\\". However, this radical left spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain right-wing, economically conservative ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by Thatcherism in the United Kingdom and Reaganomics in the United States) and also free-market reforms in China and in Vietnam. The seeming triumph of Neoliberalism as the sole world- ideology led some liberal and conservative writers, such as Francis Fukuyama to write, as in his work 'The End of History and the Last Man', that although Marxist and Hegelian theory was correct in that dialectical materialism had led to an ideal society, this society was in fact late-twentieth century liberalism, and that there would be no further political change beyond the confines of capitalism and liberalism for the foreseeable future. Indeed, according to Marxist literary critic Terry Eagleton this acknowledgement of the fundamental reliability (though tweaked) of Marxist theory, yet the denial of its global applicability in the face of ascendant Reaganite and Thatcherite dogma, led to a contradiction at the heart of society in the 1980s and 1990s: :″One might have thought that if Marxism was true in 1975, as many then claimed it was, then — short of some immense sea-change in the world itself — it would also have been true in 1985. But in 1985 it was mattering less whether it was true or not, just as the existence of God was a burning issue in 1860 but hardly so a century later. Marxism was now less a disconcerting challenge than the irritating or endearing idiosyncrasy of those unable to relinquish an imaginary selfhood inherited from the past. It belonged irrevocably to the great epoch of modernity, within which, whether true or false, it figured as an entirely intelligible project. Once that age had passed into a different problematic, Marxism could be seen as at best a set of valid responses to a set of questions which were no longer on the agenda. It thus crossed over, in the eyes of some, from being false but relevant, to true but superfluous.\\" Within Marxist theory, Lenin's concept of the labor aristocracy and his description of imperialism, andseparately, but not necessarily unrelatedlyTrotsky's theories regarding the deformed workers' state, offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of proletarian internationalism.

Formal gardens covering over 50 acres (20 hectares) have now been largely lost to agricultural and commercial development. The house stands in parkland on high ground overlooking a lake and is built in brick in two storeys to a rectangular plan. The centre and oldest part has seven bays and is connected on each side by two bay links to four bay pavilions. The 1750 acre (700 hectare) estate is bordered on three sides by tributaries of the River Thames (the Whitewater, Blackwater and Loddon). Within the grounds is a traditional working farm, a livery facility, a dairy farm, a commercial partridge, pheasant and mixed bird shoot and a range of residential and commercial properties. The livery yard opened in February 2010 and is run by Gavin Crossley, formerly of the Household Cavalry. The Farley Hall Horse Trials became a new fixture in the British Eventing calendar in 2014.

His father was an importer of building materials with ties to the Iraqi leadership, including then-prime minister Nuri al-Said. The Iraqi Jews' situation became problematic with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the resulting persecution of the Jewish population by the Iraqi government. In 1951, during Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, Shlaim's family, along with most Iraqi Jews, registered to emigrate to Israel and forfeit their Iraqi citizenship. A subsequent law ruled that all those who left forfeited all rights, including property rights. The Shlaim family lost all their property. His father crossed the border illegally on a mule, while Shlaim, his mother and sisters flew to Cyprus and from there were airlifted to Israel. The family reunited in Israel. Shlaim grew up in Ramat Gan. He left Israel for England at the age of 16 to study at a Jewish school. He returned to Israel in 1964 to serve in the Israel Defense Forces, then moved back to England in 1966 to read history at Jesus College, Cambridge.

Career Shlaim addressing the Oxford Theology Society Shlaim taught International Relations at Reading University, specialising in European issues. His academic interest in the history of Israel began in 1982, when Israeli government archives about the 1948 Arab–Israeli War were opened, an interest that deepened when he became a fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford in 1987. He was Alastair Buchan Reader in International Relations at Oxford from 1987 to 1996 and Director of Graduate Studies in that subject in 1993–1995 and 1998–2001. He held a British Academy Research Readership in 1995–97 and a Research Professorship in 2003–2006. Shlaim served as an outside examiner on the doctoral thesis of Ilan Pappé, another notable New Historian. Shlaim's approach to the study of history is informed by his belief that, \\"[t]he job of the historian is to judge\\". He is a regular contributor to The Guardian newspaper, and signed an open letter to that paper in January 2009 condemning Israel's role in the Gaza War.. Letter to the editor signed by over 300 academics, writers, and others. Writing in the Spectator, Shlaim dubbed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \\"proponent of the doctrine of permanent conflict,\\" describing his policies as an attempt to preclude a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Palestinians. Furthermore, he described Israeli foreign policy as one that supported stability of Arab regimes over nascent democratic movements during the Arab Spring.Shlaim, Avi. \\"An Israeli spring? Rejecting the prospect of greater democracy in the Arab world could put the Jewish state at risk.\\" Spectator 25 Feb. 2012 Shlaim is a member of the UK Labour Party. In August 2015, he was a signatory to a letter criticising The Jewish Chronicles reporting of Jeremy Corbyn's association with alleged antisemites. Criticism The Israeli historians Joseph Heller and Yehoshua Porath have claimed that Shlaim \\"misleads his readers with arguments that Israel had missed the opportunity for peace while the Arabs are strictly peace seekers\\". In a 2012 article in the academic journal Shofar, Shai Afsai criticised Shlaim for repeating a story \\"The bride is beautiful but she is married to another man\\", for which Afsai could not trace an original source, in his 2001 book The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World.\\"'The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man': Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth\\", Shai Afsai, Shofar, Vol. 30, No. 3; 2012, pp. 35–61 Fellow New historian Benny Morris has harshly criticized Shlaim for what he claims is Shlaim's anti-Israel and pro-Arab bias. Morris accused Shlaim of consistently portraying Palestinian Arabs as the victims and their cause as righteous while vilifying the Zionist cause and Israel, and of distorting and omitting crucial information to give a one-sided portrayal of history. He referred to Shlaim's work as \\"derisionist history\\" and characterized it as full of \\"careless and inflammatory hyperbole\\" against Israel while being \\"mealy-mouthed, hesitant, disingenuous, and laudatory\\" toward the Arabs.https://newrepublic.com/article/71480/derisionist-history According to Yoav Gelber, Shlaim's claim that there was a deliberate and pre-meditated anti-Palestinian “collusion” between the Jewish Agency and King Abdullah, is unequivocally refuted by the documentary evidence on the development of contacts between Israel and Jordan before, during and after the war. Marc Lynch however wrote that \\"the voluminous evidence in [Gelber's] book does not allow so conclusive a verdict\\". Honours In 2006, Shlaim was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. On 27 September 2017, Shlaim was awarded the British Academy Medal \\"for lifetime achievement\\".

Born to a Jewish family in Tel Aviv, then part of the British Mandate of Palestine, Machover moved to Britain in 1968 where he became a naturalised citizen. He was a founder of Matzpen, the Israeli Socialist Organisation, in 1962. Career Machover has written extensively on the conflict in the Middle East. In 1961, while still members of the Israeli Communist Party, Machover and Akiva Orr, under the pseudonym 'A Israeli', wrote the anti-Zionist analysis of the Arab-Israeli conflict Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom (; \\"Peace, Peace, and there is no Peace\\"). The intention of the book was to explain, from publicly available sources, why in 1956 \\"Ben-Gurion preferred to invade Egypt, alongside France and Britain, rather than to make peace with Egypt\\".Moshé Machover and Akiva Orr, \\"Foreword after 38 years\\", in the 1999 second edition of Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom, privately published from PO Box 3050, Herzliya 46104, Israel. In the course of writing the book, \\"It became clear to us that the roots of the Israeli–Arab conflict lay, not in the conflict between Israel and the Arab states, but rather in the conflict between Zionist colonialism and the Palestinians over the land of Palestine and its independence\\". This thesis was an implicit challenge to the line of the Israeli Communist Party, which considered Israel's alliance with the U.S. to be a matter of political choice, not deriving from the colonial nature of the state. When Machover and Orr followed this by criticising the party's adherence to the Soviet line, and called for the publication of the party's history, they were expelled. Machover and Orr, together with others expelled at the same time, then established Matzpen.\\"Matzpen – A Short History\\" Together with Jabra Nicola (pen name A. Said), Moshé Machover developed the position, adopted by Matzpen, that the solution to the Israeli Palestinian problem is in a struggle to defeat Zionism and its allies – imperialism and Arab Reaction – and “rally to itself a wider struggle for the political and social liberation of the Middle East as a whole”. The struggle for Palestinian liberation can succeed only when the Palestinian and Israeli masses enter “a joint struggle with the revolutionary forces in the Arab world\\".\\"ARAB REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE ARAB EAST Machover was a lecturer in mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1960 to 1964, and again from 1966 to 1968; during 1964–66, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Bristol in England. In 1968, Machover moved permanently to London where he became Reader in Mathematical Logic at King's College London until 1995. He joined Kings from the Chelsea College of Science and Technology's Department of History and Philosophy of Science which was merged into the Philosophy Department in 1993.Michael Campbell, Andrew Johnson, David Papineau Philosophy at King’s College London– a History Since 1995, he has been Professor of Philosophy at the University of London. In London, together with Orr and Shimon Tzabar, Machover established the Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad. In 1971, Machover, Orr and Haim Hanegbi published an article in the New Left Review on \\"The Class Nature of Israeli Society\\".New Left Review I/65 This article, which has been frequently republished, is included together with several more of Machover's early writings on the Middle East in the collection The Other Israel: the radical case against Zionism.Copy on the Matzpen website In 1975, Machover was one of the founders of Khamsin, the \\"journal of revolutionary socialists of the Middle East\\".Khamsin on the Matzpen website Many of his articles from Khamsin are included in the collection Forbidden Agendas.'Forbidden Agendas: Intolerance and Defiance in the Middle East (ed.

In October 2017, he was expelled from the Labour Party on suspicion he was associated with the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), in contravention of party rules.

Accessed: 6 June 2013. A member of such a class is a proletarian. Marxist philosophy considers the proletariat to be oppressed by capitalism, forced to accept meager wages in return for operating the means of production, which belong to the class of business owners, the bourgeoisie. Marx claimed that this oppression gives the proletariat common economic and political interests that transcend national boundaries, impelling them to unite and take over power from the capitalist class, and eventually to create a communist society free from class distinctions.  Roman Republic  The constituted a social class of Roman citizens who owned little or no property. The name presumably originated with the census, which Roman authorities conducted every five years to produce a register of citizens and their property, which determined their military duties and voting privileges. Those who owned 11,000 or less fell below the lowest category for military service, and their children— (offspring)—were listed instead of property; hence the name (producer of offspring). Roman citizen-soldiers paid for their own horses and arms, and fought without payment for the commonweal, but the only military contribution of a was his children, the future Roman citizens who could colonize conquered territories. Officially, propertyless citizens were called because they were \\"persons registered not as to their property...but simply as to their existence as living individuals, primarily as heads () of a family.\\"Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953) at 380; 657. Although included in the (Centuriate Assembly), were the lowest class, largely deprived of voting rights.Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (1953) at 351; 657 (quote). Late Roman historians such as Livy vaguely described the as a popular assembly of early Rome composed of , voting units representing classes of citizens according to wealth. This assembly, which usually met on the to discuss public policy, designated the military duties of Roman citizens.Titus Livius ( – AD 17), Ab urbe condita, 1, 43; the first five books translated by Aubrey de Sélincourt as Livy, The Early History of Rome (Penguin 1960, 1971) at 81–82. One of the reconstructions of the features 18 of cavalry, and 170 of infantry divided into five classes by wealth, plus 5 of support personnel called , one of which represented the . In battle, the cavalry brought their horses and arms, the top infantry class full arms and armor, the next two classes less, the fourth class only spears, the fifth slings, while the assisting adsidui held no weapons. In voting, the cavalry and top infantry class were enough to decide an issue; as voting started at the top, issues were usually decided before the lower classes voted.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford University 1999) at 55–61, re the . After the Second Punic War in 201 BC, the Jugurthine War and various conflicts in Macedonia and Asia reduced the number of Roman family farmers, and the Republic experienced a shortage of propertied citizen soldiers.Cf., Theodor Mommsen, (1854–1856), 3 volumes; translated as History of Rome (1862–1866), 4 volumes; reprint (The Free Press 1957) at vol. III: 48–55 (Mommsen's Bk. III, ch. XI toward end). The Marian reforms of 107 BC extended military eligibility to the urban poor, and henceforth the , as paid soldiers, became the backbone of the army, which later served as the decisive force in the fall of the Republic and the establishment of the Empire.H.

Modern use In the early 19th century, many Western European liberal scholars — who dealt with social sciences and economics — pointed out the socio-economic similarities of the modern rapidly growing industrial worker class and the classic proletarians. One of the earliest analogies can be found in the 1807 paper of French philosopher and political scientist Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais. Later it was translated to English with the title \\"Modern Slavery\\".Félicité Robert de Lamennais: Modern Slavery (1840) Swiss liberal economist and historian was the first to apply the proletariat term to the working class created under capitalism, and whose writings were frequently cited by Karl Marx. Marx most likely encountered the term while studying the works of Sismondi. =Marxist theory= Marx, who studied Roman law at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin,Cf., Sidney Hook, Marx and the Marxists (Princeton: Van Nostrand 1955) at 13. used the term proletariat in his socio- political theory (Marxism) to describe a progressive working class untainted by private property and capable of revolutionary action to topple capitalism and abolish social classes, leading society to ever higher levels of prosperity and justice. Marx defined the proletariat as the social class having no significant ownership of the means of production (factories, machines, land, mines, buildings, vehicles) and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their labor power for a wage or salary. Proletarians are wage-workers, while some (though not Marx himself) distinguish salaried workers as the salariat. A 1911 Industrial Worker publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat \\"work for all\\" and \\"feed all\\". Marxist theory only vaguely defines the borders between the proletariat and adjacent social classes. In the socially superior, less progressive direction are the lower petty bourgeoisie, such as small shopkeepers, who rely primarily on self-employment at an income comparable to an ordinary wage. Intermediate positions are possible, where wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. In another direction, the lumpenproletariat or \\"rag-proletariat\\", which Marx considers a retrograde class, live in the informal economy outside of legal employment: the poorest outcasts of society such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes. Socialist parties have often argued over whether they should organize and represent all the lower classes, or only the wage- earning proletariat. According to Marxism, capitalism is based on the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie: the workers, who own no means of production, must use the property of others to produce goods and services and to earn their living. Workers cannot rent the means of production (e.g. a factory or department store) to produce on their own account; rather, capitalists hire workers, and the goods or services produced become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at market. Part of the net selling price pays the workers' wages (variable costs); a second part renews the means of production (constant costs, capital investment); while the third part is consumed by the capitalist class, split between the capitalist's personal profit and fees to other owners (rents, taxes, interest on loans, etc.). The struggle over the first part (wage rates) puts the proletariat and bourgeoisie into irreconcilable conflict, as market competition pushes wages inexorably to the minimum necessary for the workers to survive and continue working. The second part, called capitalized surplus value, is used to renew or increase the means of production (capital), either in quantity or quality.Luxemburg, Rosa. The Accumulation of Capital. Chapter 6, Enlarged Reproduction, http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1913/accumulation-capital/ch06.htm The second and third parts are known as surplus value, the difference between the wealth the proletariat produce and the wealth they consumeMarx, Karl. The Capital, volume 1, chapter 6. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm Marxists argue that new wealth is created through labor applied to natural resources.Marx, Karl. Critique of the Gotha Programme, I. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm The commodities that proletarians produce and capitalists sell are valued not for their usefulness, but for the amount of labor embodied in them: for example, air is essential but requires no labor to produce, and is therefore free; while a diamond is much less useful, but requires hundreds of hours of mining and cutting, and is therefore expensive. The same goes for the workers' labor power: it is valued not for the amount of wealth it produces, but for the amount of labor necessary to keep the workers fed, housed, sufficiently trained, and able to raise children as new workers. On the other hand, capitalists earn their wealth not as a function of their personal labor, which may even be null, but by the juridical relation of their property to the means of production (e.g. owning a factory or farmland). Marx argued that the proletariat would inevitably displace the capitalist system with the dictatorship of the proletariat, abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a communist society in which \\"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\\".Marx, Karl. The Communist Manifesto, part II, Proletarians and Communists http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist- manifesto/ch02.htm =Proletarian culture= Marx argued that each social class had its characteristic culture and politics. The socialist states stemming from the Russian Revolution championed an official version of proletarian culture. This was quite different from the working-class culture of capitalist countries, which tend to experience \\"prole drift\\" (proletarian drift), in which everything inexorably becomes commonplace and commodified by means of mass production, mass selling, mass communication and mass education. Examples include best-seller lists, films, and music made to appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.

Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) used the term \\"false consciousness\\" in an 1893 letter to Franz Mehring to address the scenario where a subordinate class willfully embodies the ideology of the ruling class. Engels dubs this consciousness \\"false\\" because the class is asserting itself towards goals that do not benefit it. \\"Consciousness\\", in this context, reflects a class's ability to politically identify and assert its will. The subordinate class is conscious: it plays a major role in society and can assert its will due to being sufficiently unified in ideas and action.  Later development  Marshall I. Pomer has argued that members of the proletariat disregard the true nature of class relations because of their belief in the probability or possibility of upward mobility. Such a belief or something like it is said to be required in economics with its presumption of rational agency; otherwise wage laborers would not be the conscious supporters of social relations antithetical to their own interests, violating that presumption.This phenomenon is most accentuated in the United States, and has given rise to what some European Marxists refer to as \\"class transference\\". = Cultural hegemony = The Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci developed the concept of cultural hegemony, the process within capitalist societies by which the ruling classes create particular norms, values, and stigmas, amounting to a culture in which their continued dominance is considered beneficial. = Structuralism = During the late 1960s and 1970s, the philosophical and anthropological school of structuralism began to gain popularity among academics and public intellectuals, focusing on interpreting human culture in terms of underlying structures such as symbolic, linguistic, and ideological perspectives. Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser popularized his structuralist interpretation of false consciousness, the Ideological State Apparatus. Structuralism influenced Althusser's interpretation of false consciousness, which focuses on the institutions of the capitalist state⁠—particularly those of public education⁠—which enforce an ideological system favoring obedience, conformity and submissiveness. = Contemporary developments = Other prominent Marxist philosophers and intellectuals developed specific interpretations of the concept of false consciousness, such as Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School, Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem of the French situationist movement, the anti-colonialist writer Frantz Fanon, and contemporary philosopher Slavoj Žižek. Outside of the Marxist political ideology, the economist Edward S. Herman and linguist Noam Chomsky developed the propaganda model wherein information is selectively broadcast to serve the ends of a deeply centralized ownership of private media industries.

Stanford: Stanford University Press =1947–1948 war= Ajami played a significant role in the history of Jaffa including the 1947–1949 Palestine war and the events of the Nakba. Following the decision by the British Government to end the Mandate for Palestine, violence erupted between the Jewish paramilitary groups (Haganah and Irgun) and Palestinian Arab irregulars. Jaffa witnessed some of the most violent of these encounters. On May 13, 1948, the day before the declaration of the Israeli state, Jaffa surrendered the remaining Arab residents were forced to move into Ajami, where they were subject to martial law. By the end of the war, it is estimated that over 90% of Jaffa's Palestinian Arab residents fled. Some 3,000 remained in Jaffa. =State of Israel= After the establishment of the State of Israel, the Israeli government tried to separate Jews and Palestinians of Jaffa: “It will be best to have special areas for the Jews and areas for the Arabs,” said the military governor Meir Laniado. Palestinians were moved to Ajami, which was surrounded on all sides by Jewish quarters. Moshe Erem from the Israeli Ministry for Minority Affairs protested to prime minister Meir Sheetrit: “Ajami is about to be closed off with a barbed-wire fence that will rigorously separate the Arab neighborhood and the Jewish section. That arrangement will immediately render Ajami a sealed-off ghetto. It is hard to accept this idea, which stirs in us associations of excessive horror. … And once more we are thereby sowing a toxic seed … in the heart of the Arabs. A ghetto in barbed wire, a ghetto, cut off from access to the sea. Shall this be our political approach?” Palestinians needed special permits “to exit the barbed wire.”Adam Raz: “When Israel Placed Arabs in Ghettos Fenced by Barbed Wire.” Haaretz, 27 May 2020. Over the years, Ajami became run-down and neglected, and was reported to be the lowest-income neighborhood in Tel Aviv-Yafo despite being known for its palatial villas and unique architectural styles prior to 1948. The neighborhood suffers from a severe housing crisis and drug-use.  Gentrification projects  Restored historic building Despite these socio- economic problems and the neighborhood's severe housing crisis, the Tel Aviv- Yafo municipality drew up plans to develop the neighborhood, which subsequently increased housing prices and led to the exodus of a growing number of Palestinian residents. Many of Ajami's Arab residents feel that they have come to suffer under Tel Aviv-Yafo's Municipality's plans to 'develop' the neighborhood. Since the start of the gentrification process, many wealthy Jewish Israelis have moved into the neighborhood. In addition, some 497 eviction and demolition orders have been served by the Amidar, Israel's government-operated public housing company, targeting Ajami and Jabaliyya residents. Ajami residents claim that this is a result of discriminatory policies which date back to the establishment of the Israeli state, but the Amidar company says they are illegal squatters. The housing crisis developed political overtones when one of the housing projects, B'emuna, said its apartments would be sold only to members of the religious-Zionist community. In February 2010, the Tel Aviv District Court dismissed a stop work petition presented by 27 Ajami residents, which argued that the stipulation that housing in the project be available only to religious Jews discriminated against the neighborhood’s Arab residents. In November 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected the appeal and upheld the continuation of the project.

The mosque and the adjoining school were previously owned by the Islamic Waqf, until the Israeli authorities annulled their status as Waqf property under Israel's Absentee's Property Law. = Arab-Jewish community center = The Arab Jewish Community Center in Ajami Ajami is the location of the Jaffa AJCC, a municipal community center in Tel Aviv-Yafo catering to Jewish, Christian, and Muslim populations in the city. The center was established in 1993, bringing together conflicting populations and educating towards reconciliation, recognition and cooperation. Both facilitated and unmediated encounters take place at the center between members of Jaffa’s diverse ethnic and age groups, including children from Jewish and Arab kindergartens, elementary and high school students, and adults. = Peres Center for Peace = Peres Center for Peace The Peres Center for Peace, located in the southern tip of Ajami, opened in December 2009 after 10 years of planning and construction. The building (2,500 sq.m.), a distinctive architectural landmark on the Jaffa coast, was designed by Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas.  Tourism and recreation  \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a popular Arab seafood restaurant in the southern part of Ajami. Abu Hassan is a small hummus restaurant located on the northern tip of Ajami.

Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the productive forces) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. feudalism, capitalism and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new economic systems. In the term orthodox Marxism, the word \\"orthodox\\" refers to the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism—and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.Lukács, Georg. What is Orthodox Marxism?. Marxism Internet Archive (1919): \\"What is Orthodox Marxism?\\". \\"Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the 'belief' in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a 'sacred' book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method.\\" Leon Trotsky and his followers have called themselves Orthodox Marxists.  Theory  The emergence of orthodox Marxism is associated with the latter works of Friedrich Engels, such as the Dialectics of Nature and Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, which were efforts to popularise the work of Karl Marx, render it systematic and apply it to the fundamental questions of philosophy.Jack Mendelson. \\"On Engels' metaphysical dialectics: A foundation of orthodox \\"Marxism\\"\\" Dialectical Anthropology. 1979. Volume 4. Issue 1. pp. 65–73. Daniel De Leon, an early American socialist leader, contributed much to the thought during the final years of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Orthodox Marxism was further developed during the Second International by thinkers such as Georgi Plekhanov and Karl Kautsky in Erfurt Program and The Class Struggle (Erfurt Program). The characteristics of orthodox Marxism are: * A strong version of the theory that the economic base (material conditions) determines the cultural and political superstructure of society. In its most extensive form, this view is called economic determinism, economism and vulgar materialism. A related variation is that of technological determinism. * The view that capitalism cannot be reformed through policy and that any attempt to do so would only exacerbate its contradictions or distort the efficiency of the market economy (in contrast to reformism). Orthodox Marxism holds that the only viable and lasting solution to the contradictions of capitalism is for the establishment of a post-capitalist socialist economy. * The centrality of class as a process and the view that existing policymakers and government is largely and structurally beholden to the interests of the ruling class. This view is called instrumental Marxism. * The claim that Marxist methodology is a science. * The attempt to make Marxism a total system, adapting it to changes within the realm of current events and knowledge. * An understanding of ideology in terms of false consciousness. * That every open class struggle is a political struggle. * A pre-crisis emphasis on organizing an independent, mass workers' movement (in the form of welfare, recreational, educational and cultural organizations) and especially its political party, combining reform struggles and mass strikes without overreliance on either. * The socialist revolution is necessarily the act of the majority (contrasted with Marxism–Leninism's view of the vanguard party and democratic centralism). Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with revisionist Marxism as developed in post- First World War Social Democratic parties. Some writers also contrast it with Marxism–Leninism as it developed in the Soviet Union, while others describe the latter as firmly within orthodoxy: > Orthodox Marxism rested on and grew out of the European working class > movement that emerged in the final quarter of the 19th century and continued > in that form until the middle years of the twentieth century. Its two > institutional expressions were the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, which despite > the great schism in 1919, were marked by a shared conception of capital and > labour. Their fortunes therefore rose and fell together. Trotskyism and Left > communism were equally orthodox in their thinking and approach, and > therefore must be considered left-variants of this tradition.Mike Rooke. > \\"Marxism is Dead! Long Live Marxism!\\". Two variants of orthodox Marxism are impossibilism and anti-revisionism. Impossibilism is a form of orthodox Marxism that both rejects the reformism of revisionist Marxism and opposes the Leninist theories of imperialism, vanguardism and democratic centralism (which argue that socialism can be constructed in underdeveloped, quasi-feudal countries through revolutionary action as opposed to being an emergent result of advances in material development). An extreme form of this position is held by the Socialist Party of Great Britain.Howard, M.C. and King, J.E. State Capitalism in the Soviet Union. History of Economic Thought Society of Australia: http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf: \\"The same point was made, in the United Kingdom, by the leadership of the remorselessly orthodox Socialist Party of Great Britain\\". In contrast, the anti-revisionist tradition criticised official Communist parties from the opposite perspective as having abandoned the orthodox Marxism of the founding fathers.  Variants  A number of theoretical perspectives and political movements emerged that were firmly rooted in orthodox Marxist analysis, as contrasted with later interpretations and alternative developments in Marxist theory and practice such as Marxism–Leninism, revisionism and reformism. = Impossibilism = Impossibilism stresses the limited value of economic, social, cultural and political reforms under capitalism and posits that socialists and Marxists should solely focus on efforts to propagate and establish socialism, disregarding any other cause that has no connection to the goal of the realization of socialism. Impossibilism posits that reforms to capitalism are counterproductive because they strengthen support for capitalism by the working class by making its conditions more tolerable while creating further contradictions of their own, while removing the socialist character of the parties championing and implementing said reforms. Because reforms cannot solve the systemic contradictions of capitalism, impossibilism opposes reformism, revisionism and ethical socialism. Impossibilism also opposes the idea of a vanguard-led revolution and the centralization of political power in any elite group of people as espoused by Leninism and Marxism–Leninism . This perspective is maintained by the World Socialist Movement, De Leonism, and to some extent followers of Karl Kautsky and pre-reformist social democracy. =Leninism= Kautsky and to a lesser extent Plekhanov were in turn major influences on Vladimir Lenin, whose version of Marxism was known as Leninism by its contemporaries. The official thought of the Third International was based in orthodox Marxism combined with Leninist views on revolutionary organization initially. The terms dialectical materialism and historical materialism are associated with this phase of orthodox Marxism. Rosa Luxemburg, Hal Draper and Rudolf Hilferding are prominent thinkers in the orthodox Marxist tradition. Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with later variations of Marxism, notably revisionism and Stalinism. In contrast to Stalin's idea of the socialism in a single backward country, orthodox Marxists said that Imperial Russia was too backwards for the development of socialism and would first have undergo a capitalist (bourgeois) phase of development even if a Marxist party would head its government. Lenin urged a socialist revolution in Russia to inspire a socialist revolution in Germany and in the majority of the developed countries. His and Trotsky's New Economic Policy was to develop capitalism in Russia initially. = Luxemburgism = Luxemburgism is an informal designation for a current of Marxist thought and practice that originates from the ideas and work of Rosa Luxemburg. In particular, it stresses the importance for spontaneous revolution which can only emerge in response to mounting contradictions between the productive forces and social relations of society and therefore rejects Leninism and Bolshevism for its insistence on a \\"hands-on\\" approach to revolution. Luxemburgism is also highly critical of the reformist Marxism that emerged from the work of Eduard Bernstein's informal faction of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism \\"[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms\\". = Trotskyism = Trotsky did not believe in the true socialism in a single country especially in a backward country and pledged himself to Luxemburgism, trying to represent himself and even Lenin as the left followers of Luxemburgism. He supported democracy and free competition of parties in his book The Revolution Betrayed.[J. Dawsey Trotsky’s Struggle against Stalin //US national WWII museum. 09.2018Chavez, Maduro and their followers present themselves as Trotskyists. N. Flakin Was There a Socialist Revolution in Venezuela? Using Trotsky’s Ideas to Understand Chávez’s Legacy //Left Voice. 8.2020 = Anti-Stalinist Left = = Menshevism = Menshevism refers to the political positions taken by the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party prior to the October Revolution of 1917. The Mensheviks believed that socialism could not be realized in Russia due to its backwards economic conditions and that Russia would first have to experience a bourgeois revolution and go through a capitalist stage of development before socialism became technically possible and before the working class could develop the class consciousness for a socialist revolution. The Mensheviks were thus opposed to the Bolshevik idea of a vanguard party and their pursuit of socialist revolution in semi-feudal Russia. = Karl Kautsky and \\"Kautskyism\\" = Karl Kautsky is recognized as the most authoritative promulgator of orthodox Marxism following the death of Friedrich Engels in 1895. As an advisor to August Bebel, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) until Bebel's death in 1913 and as editor of Die Neue Zeit from 1883 till 1917, he was known as the \\"Pope of Marxism\\". He was removed as editor by the leadership of the SPD when the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) split away from the SPD. Kautsky was an outspoken critic of Bolshevism and Leninism, seeing the Bolsheviks (or Communists as they had renamed themselves after 1917) as an organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Kautsky was also opposed to Eduard Bernstein's reformist politics in the period 1896–1901. = Instrumental Marxism = Instrumental Marxism is a theory derived from classical Marxism which reasons that policy makers in government and positions of power tend to \\"share a common business or class background, and that their decisions will reflect their business or class interests\\".Goldstein, Joshua S. 2004. International Relations. Canadian Edition. Ed. Whitworth, Sandra. Toronto: Pearson Education. p. 147.  Criticism  There have been a number of criticisms of orthodox Marxism from within the socialist movement. From the 1890s during the Second International, Eduard Bernstein and others developed a position known as revisionism, which sought to revise Marx's views based on the idea that the progressive development of capitalism and the extension of democracy meant that gradual, parliamentary reform could achieve socialism. But Bernstein himself was a revolutionary and joined Independent Social Democratic Party in Germany which requested for the socialist republic in 1918. This view was contested by orthodox Marxists such as Kautsky as well as by the young Georg Lukacs, who in 1919 clarified the definition of orthodox Marxism as thus: > [O]rthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction > that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can > be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its > founders. It is the conviction, moreover, that all attempts to surpass or > 'improve' it have led and must lead to over-simplification, triviality and > eclecticism.\\"What is Orthodox Marxism?\\". March 1919 Western Marxism, the intellectual Marxism which developed in Western Europe from the 1920s onwards, sought to make Marxism more \\"sophisticated\\", open and flexible by examining issues like culture that were outside the field of orthodox Marxism. Western Marxists, such as Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt School, have tended to be open to influences orthodox Marxists consider bourgeois, such as psychoanalysis and the sociology of Max Weber. Marco Torres illustrates the shift away from orthodox Marxism in the Frankfurt School: > In the early 1920s, the original members of the Frankfurt Institute—half > forgotten names such as Carl Grünberg, Henryk Grossman and Karl August > Wittfogel, were social scientists of an orthodox Marxist conviction. They > understood their task as an advancement of the sciences that would prove > useful in solving the problems of a Europe-wide transition into socialism, > which they saw, if not as inevitable, at least as highly likely. But as > fascism reared its head in Germany and throughout Europe, the younger > members of the Institute saw the necessity for a different kind of Marxist > Scholarship. Beyond accumulating knowledge relevant to an orthodox Marxist > line, they felt the need to take the more critical and negative approach > that is required for the maintenance of an integral and penetrating > understanding of society during a moment of reaction. This could be > described as the politically necessary transition from Marxist positive > science to Critical Theory.Marco Torres \\"The science that wasn't: The > orthodox Marxism of the early Frankfurt School and the turn to Marxist > Critical Theory\\". Platypus. May 1, 2008. In parallel to this, Cedric Robinson has identified a Black Marxist tradition, including people like C.L.R. James and W. E. B. Du Bois, who have opened Marxism to the study of race. In the postwar period, the New Left and new social movements gave rise to intellectual and political currents which again challenged orthodox Marxism. These include Italian autonomism, French Situationism, the Yugoslavian Praxis School, British cultural studies, Marxist feminism, Marxist humanism, analytical Marxism and critical realism.

History Founded by a former Raja of Rewah or by the Raja Raghunath Singh of Nayagarh, who had two sons, the elder son, Harihar Singh, became Raja of Nayagarh, and the younger, Jadunath Singh Mangraj, retained possession of four Garhs, or forts, as his share, viz.

In the reign of Raja Narayan Singh Mangraj, Khandpara extended on the east up to Banki, on the west to Balaramprasad in Daspalla, on the north to Kantilo, and on the south up to Jogiapali in Nayagarh. State was initially part of Nayagarh State, founded by a former ruler of Rewa State, but became a separate kingdom in 1599 when Jadunath Singh Mangraj, the first ruler of Khandpara received the title of 'Mangraj' from the Maharaja of Orissa. The rulers were Rajputs of the Baghela or Vaghela dynasty. At the time when Padmanabha Mangaraj was the king of Baramba, the king of Khandapara attacked Baramba kingdom and captured Baramba kingdom.(Source:Feudatory States of Orissa: Bengal District Gazetteers by L.

Courses are given on weekends in winter and spring, and during the summer. The school teaches a broad range of skills including fiber arts, woodworking, pottery, jewelry and photography. Location The school is on Vermont Route 103 between Ludlow and Proctorsville. It lies in Vermont's beautiful Green Mountains. The property is at the east end of the village of Ludlow. It was settled in 1783 by Jesse Fletcher and Lucy Keyes. The first frame house they built is said to be the oldest in the town. In 1805 they built a larger addition. Both were still in use as of 2014. The property stayed in the family, and successive owners added buildings. These include barns and cabins where visitors can stay during summer courses. At other times students can stay in Ludlow. The Society of Vermont Artists and Craftsmen runs a small arts-and-crafts store at the school in summer. School history Allen M. Fletcher, a banker, was governor of Vermont in 1912–15. His widow and daughters gave the property to the YWCA in 1928 for use as a training school. The program did not succeed and in 1933 the YWCA returned the property to the Fletchers. Later that year a non-profit educational foundation was formed named Fletcher Farm Inc. It was given the property, including the buildings and about of meadows and forest, on condition that the property should always by used for educational purposes. The original trustees included Dorothy Canfield Fisher and Robert Frost. The school gave various adult education courses over the next fifteen years. For example, in the summer of 1934 Grace Coyle organized a two-week group work institute for forty YWCA and settlement house workers at Fletcher Farm. In 1935 two theologians, Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman, spent ten days at a religious retreat at Fletcher Farm. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote his doctoral dissertion on the differences in the two men's views of God. In 1948 the farmhouse, sugar house and barns were leased to the non-profit Society of Vermont Craftsmen. They have operated the Fletcher Farm Craft School ever since. The noted weaver Berta Frey was an instructor at the Fletcher Farm School in the early years. Irene Slater taught at the school in the 1950s, described as a \\"professional decorator, specializing in the reproduction of reverse painting of old clock and mirror glasses. Collector of original pieces.\\" Ronald Alfred Slayton taught summer courses at the school in the 1950s and 1960s, where he developed a naturalistic style of watercolor painting, rich in color. Joseph Skinger taught jewelry for several years at the school. Programs Students are generally mature adults. Fees cover food and lodging, tuition and studio space. The school offers the oldest and most respected crafts program in Vermont. Subjects have included off-loom weaving, wooden-spoon carving, quilting, pottery, bookbinding and gourd or birch-bark vessel design. In 2014 the Winter/Spring classes included basketry, fiber arts, fine arts and photography, jewelry and lapidary. The summer courses included basketry, clay, early American decoration, fiber arts, fine arts and photography, glass, jewelry, quilting and fabrics, specialty arts and crafts and wood and woodcarving.

St. John's Church (also known as St John the Baptist Church) is a 19th-century Anglican church, located in Fortuneswell village, on the Isle of Portland, Dorset. It was built between 1838–40 and has been a Listed Grade II building since January 1951. The churchyard walls, gate piers, railings, and steps of St. John's Church, dating from 1839–40, became Grade II Listed in September 1978. At this same time, two headstone monuments, about 5 metres north east from the west tower of the church became Grade II Listed. Designed by Edward Mondey or Charles Wallis, the church cost £2,315. Built of Portland stone, the church has a Gothic design in Commissioners' Early English style. It has also been described as Norman in its architecture. The church remains active, as part of the Portland Parish - a host of three churches; St John's Church (St John the Baptist), All Saints Church and the Avalanche Memorial Church (St Andrew's Church). History St John's Church St George's Church, built between 1754-66, was the island's only parish church into the 19th century. However, by the 1830s, it had become too small and inconvenient for the increasing population within Underhill. It was decided that a new church should be built for Underhill as a sister church to St George's. The church's construction commenced in 1838, and was completed by 1840, with the work undertaken by John Hancock of Weymouth.https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/199172/Portland- conservation-area- appraisal/pdf/Appraisal_of_the_Conservation_Areas_of_Portland.pdf In 1865 Underhill became a parish in its own right, with St. John's becoming the parish church.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Portland/U_Hill/St_John/St_John_1.html One section of the churchyard of St John's Church. During 1876 the church underwent renovation and was also enlarged. This included the addition of a chancel and organ chamber by George Crickmay. During 1901 a new Parish room for the church was built and opened at the north end of Ventnor Road. When the Second World War drew to a close, on VJ Day, the 14th Port Regiment of the US Army presented its Stars and Stripes colours to St John's Church, as a memento of its close association with the people of Portland, both service and civilian. In 1968 a Father Willis Organ was brought from St Paul's School, Kensington, London for £2,000, and installed after the balcony was reinforced. The organ fell into disrepair due to lack of use, with repairs quoted at an unachievable £100,000. In 2013 it was sold to the Parish Church of Our Lady of Loretu, Għajnsielem Gozo.

Route  Flyover of the Priemerburg–Plaaz line over the Güstrow–Meyenburg line (left) and the Bützow–Szczecin line (right) Like the Güstrow–Meyenburg railway, the line to Plaaz separates from the line to Neubrandenburg not in Güstrow, but three kilometres to its east in the settlement of Priemerburg. It runs to the south from the junction and then crosses the other tracks on a bridge. To the right is the route of the former connecting curve to Priemerwald Süd. After running through a wooded area, it passes through Glasewitz station, which closed in 1993 and has left few traces. The following section runs through open, rolling countryside. The now closed Mierdorf station was outside the village in an open field. Shortly afterwards, the line joins the Neustrelitz–Warnemünde railway (Lloyd Railway) to the south of Plaaz station.  History  The Güstrow Plau Railway (Güstrow-Plauer Eisenbahn) opened its main line from Güstrow to Plau in 1882, which was later extended to Meyenburg. The Lloyd Railway connecting Neustrelitz and Rostock was opened in 1886, but it by- passed the town of Güstrow. Then, a nearly ten kilometre-long connection was opened to Plaaz on the Lloyd Railway by the Güstrow Plau Railway in 1887. The importance of the line was limited to local traffic, especially after 1887 when the direct connection from Güstrow to Rostock over the Güstrow–Schwaan railway went into operation. The Güstrow Plau Railway was nationalised in 1890 and incorporated in the Friedrich-Franz Railway, which was nationalised at the same time. The traffic in the first half of the 20th century consisted of three to four pairs of trains daily between Güstrow and Plaaz, which usually connected in Plaaz with trains on the Lloyd Railway to Rostock. = 1945–1990 = Plaaz station, July 2008 After the Second World War, the Lloyd Railway south of Plaaz was dismantled as reparations to the Soviet Union and trains ran from Güstrow via Plaaz to Rostock. This continued after the reconstruction of the Lloyd Railway. The line had additional importance in the first years after the Second World War until 1948, because it was the only connection from Rostock to the south after the Rostock–Schwaan–Bützow line was also dismantled. The importance of the line for freight traffic grew with the construction of the new port of Rostock up to 1960. It provided a connection from Kavelstorf to the ports of Bützow and Güstrow. It was connected via a new connecting curve to the operations station of Priemerwald Süd and the lines to Neubrandenburg and Pritzwalk. This relieved the junctions of Rostock and Güstrow. The connecting curve was built with double track so that trains could cross there. The line was electrified in 1985 primarily for freight operations. The passenger traffic was limited over the years to about six pairs of trains a day on the Güstrow–Plaaz–Rostock route and the line speed remained at branch line standards. Occasionally there were express trains on the line, such as in 1988/89 inter-zone train on the Rostock–Güstrow–Hamburg –Cologne route, which ran this way to Güstrow to avoid having to reverse. = Since 1990 = Railcar of the Ostseeland-Verkehr at the former Priemerwald Ost junction, July 2008 With the decline in freight traffic, the Priemerwald connecting curve became unnecessary and it was closed. Passenger services were harmonized in 1996 and after that trains ran every two hours. Since 2000, it has been operated as part of the Ostmecklenburgischem Eisenbahn (now Ostseeland Verkehr), part of the Veolia Verkehr group. After a year and half of closure due to the renovation of the adjoining section of the Lloyd Railway, trains have run since June 2007 between Rostock, Plaaz and Güstrow every two hours; on Monday to Friday mornings and afternoons services were hourly. As of 9 December 2012, the line was included the Rostock S-Bahn network and since then it has been operated as part of the new line S3 (Güstrow–Rostock Hbf–Warnemünde ) every hour or, on weekends, every two hours. It is operated with Bombardier Talent railcars. Mierdorf station was abandoned from that date. Glasewitz station had already closed in the mid-1990s.

There were 80 episodes divided into two parts, each with 40 episodes. The first half of the series was titled Su destino es hoy (Her destiny is today), and the second remaining half was titled Violetta está cambiando (Violetta is changing).  Plot  Violetta, along with her father, Germán, just got back to her hometown, Buenos Aires, after living in Europe for some years. Later, it turns out she has a passion for music, dancing and singing. But her father doesn't want her to sing after the accident that happened to her mother, Maria. She was a famous singer who died in a car accident during a tour commissioned by her father when Violetta was just five years old. German had moved his construction business and her (Violetta) away from Maria's father, whom German blamed for Maria's death. However, his own recent death prompts German and Violetta's return. Now, Violetta is back in Argentina with no friends and seemingly no one who understands her until one day, in the rain, she slips and literally falls into the arms of Tomas. With the help of her new governess, Angie (who is also secretly her aunt), Violetta enrolled at Studio 21 without her father's knowledge. There, she meets her first love, makes new friends, and meets a rival, Ludmilla. She keeps building up her musical talent day after day until the final show at the end of the year, where Angie manages to convince German, who now finally understands that singing and dancing is Violetta's passion and lets her attend Studio 21.

It was written by Stephen Sondheim, and was introduced by Elaine Stritch. It became her signature song. Production In regard to her performance, which one interviewer described as filled with \\"rage\\", Elaine Stritch responded \\"I don’t think I sang it with rage. First of all, she drank. I should have made you understand that. Anyway, when you drink, you can do anything you want, and it’s not always very attractive. I tried to say to the audience, 'And here’s to the ones who just watch—and they’re not here anymore. \\"Stritch’s epic struggle with her big number\\" serves as the climax to the D.A. Pennebaker’s 1970 documentary, Original Cast Album: Company. \\"Stritch, Stephen Sondheim, and the orchestra were all exhausted because it was after midnight and the end of a long day of recording\\". After struggling several times to perform the vocals, the recording session was suspended. Stritch returned two days later, after a matinee performance of Company, and successfully recorded the final take for the album. Synopsis Bustle magazine gives this synopsis: The Ladies Who Lunch' is a song that mockingly judges the rich and wealthy women who waste their middle-aged lives doing nothing meaningful, sung by Joanne (Stritch) while out at a nightclub with her third husband Larry and their friend Robert\\". Critical reception Bustle wrote of Stritch: \\"The performance is so famous, in fact, that it has been parodied many times in pop culture\\". The Wire called it Stritch's \\"signature song\\", while The New York Times' obituary named it \\"her theme, until her 70s, when Sondheim's 'I'm Still Here' from Follies took over\\". The Guardian described Stritch's performance of the song in the 1972 London production: The site compared it to a performance she gave in 2002, writing in this performance \\"the song is an anthem of forgiveness. Whatever those ladies had been doing was just human, and she's tolerating it, wryly, dryly. The dame has forgiven everybody: she has forgiven herself\\". Covers The song has been sung by every actress who played Joanne in Company, including Debra Monk (1995 Broadway revival), Sheila Gish (1996 London Revival), Barbara Walsh (2006 Broadway Revival), Lynn Redgrave (2002 Kennedy Center), Haydn Gwynne (2010 London Revival), Patti LuPone (2011 Concert, 2018 London Revival, 2020 Broadway Revival), and Alan Cumming (2013 New York Reading). Anna Kendrick covered the song in the 2003 film Camp. The song was included on Barbra Streisand’s 1985 hit album The Broadway Album, as a medley with Sondheim’s “Pretty Women” from the musical Sweeney Todd (1979). A parody of the song was performed by drag performer Jinkx Monsoon, who included it in her debut album The Inevitable Album (2014) under the title \\"Ladies in Drag\\". Meryl Streep, Audra McDonald and Christine Baranski sang the song over a three-way Zoom video conferencing call during the COVID-19 quarantine to commemorate Sondheim's 90th birthday.

It tells the story of a crime reporter of the newspaper named Khabardaar and the journey he embarks with a truck driver to catch an escaped prisoner. The film is inspired by the 1940 classic American film His Girl Friday starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Plot At evening Home Minister (Vijay Chavan) arrives at his home as all reporters are waiting for him outside, he addresses to the media that the news of Renowned Gangster & Terrorist Anna Chimbori (Vinay Apte) been captured is true, and as the government had promised that after winning the elections under 100 days they have captured Anna Chimbori in his hideout at Haripur village near Pune, from there Mumbai and via Sea route to Fiji Island he was preparing to escape but the police intervened captured him. And the Foster Minister of Haripur Mr More (Makarand Anaspure) will bring him to Pune tomorrow under security convoy for further investigation. For now he is kept in custody at Haripur Central Jail. At Haripur Central Jail reporters wait for Mr More and he arrives with Sr Inspector Chandraji Suryaji Pisal (Sunil Tawde) and he reports to the media, that yesterday at night 11.00pm our Sr Inspector Chandraji Suryaji Pisal under my supervision has arrested Anna Chimbori, as the reporters mob & harass him commenting that we don't need your statement we want Chimbori, between this chaos a cell phone device slips from a hand and falls down when it rings, it is revealed that the cell phone belongs to Star Reporter of Newspaper Daily Khabardar Bharat Bhalerao (Bharat Jadhav) he picks the call, its his boss Chief Editor of Newspaper Daily Khabardar Miss Gauri Shringarpure (Nirmiti Sawant) and she says that she wants an interview with Anna Chimbori but Bharat tells her that it is impossible to take an interview because he is placed under strict surveillance and no one is allowed to enter the building, but Gauri urges him to make it possible and that the newspaper is the most popular in the region and she wants to keep it that way, she says to do whatever it takes but our newspaper should be the first one to interview Anna Chimbori. Bharat risks it all and climbs to the rooftops of the building as he is making his way a police constable intervenes and tries to get him but Bharat runs away while running they both slip on to the Mangalorian tiles of the rooftops and slide away to the edge head first Bharat is about to fall but the Police constable grabs him by the ankles as he was behind him, and it is no coincidence Bharat hangs in front of a cell window in which Anna Chimbori is kept. Anna Chimbori is seen speaking with his associates via cellphone and says tell the boys not to worry, I will skin the cops alive, the law cannot harm me in anyway, tell them I'm right now on Fiji Island and will return in 5 to 6 months, the cops are all cowards, I will fool these cops tonight and I will escape out of India tomorrow at 6.00am the arrangements have been done in a good way and I will fly away like a free bird. Bharat witnesses this discussion while hanging upside down and the police constable after holding Bharat for 5min loses his grip and Bharat falls as he is falling luckily a truck carrying haystacks crosses and Bharat falls into the haystack and survives, the truck driver Maruti Kamble (Sanjay Narvekar) stops the truck due to the noise which came from Bharats landing. He checks the truck but thinks that his ears are playing some tricks and goes to start the truck as he wants to deliver the haystack on time, but Bharat calls out to him and asks to drop him at Khabardar's Office, but Maruti refuses as he wants to deliver the goods on time, Bharat urges him and offers him Rs 200/- to drop him off and Maruti agrees. They reach their destination and Bharat asks Maruti his name and gives his visiting card to him and says don't hesitate to call me at anytime, on which Maruti says I'm a ordinary man why should I need help from a Journalist like you on which Bharat replies not now but if you need help in future u cant tell, so Bharat thanks him gets out of the truck. At the Office Gauri getting nervous tells her officials to Print the news and headline of Anna Chimbori's arrest, at that moment immediately Bharat runs inside the Office yelling at them to stop the Press, Gauri excited meets Bharat and asks has he interviewed Anna Chimbori but he says leave the interview I have a sensational news that Anna Chimbori will escape at 4.00am and the rest of the details are in my phone, Gauri hesitates and says are you an astrologer. Bharat tells her to trust him on this one and change the headline even the news channels will be surprised by this news. Gauri agrees to print Bharat's news but tells him if Anna Chimbori doesn't escape at 4.00am I'll make sure that you will not be seen anywhere around,do you agree??? on which Bharat agrees, and they decide to change the headline to Anna Chimbori Escapes!!!. Next Day early morning the Home Minister in a happy mood tells his secretaries to bring all the newspapers, as the government had fulfilled the promise given to the people and the newspapers must be filled with praises and showers of appreciation. As he checks all the newspapers he checks Khabardar and is shocked by reading the headline, he asks his secretaries about this and they tell him this can't be true even the news channels are showing the news of Anna's arrest, this a prank played by the Khabardar's officials. The Home Minister tells his secretary to call Foster Minister Mr More, the Home Minister asks him is the news on Khabardar true?? on which Mr More says Sir he (Anna Chimbori) was in the jail till 4.00am even the locks are in place nothing has moved from there he has disappeared like froth in water, And also I will transfer all the officers in charge immediately. Home Minister furious on hearing this replies Now the media will peel me off and at 9.00am there is a Press Conference how will you face them, now listen put blockades and checkposts at every entry & exit at Harpiur I want Anna Chimbori at any cost.

At noon in a Lavish Farmhouse Anna Chimbori is having lunch and it is revealed that Mr More & Sr Inspector Pisal both are involved in Anna's escape from prison and have kept him hidden in Mr More's Farmhouse. Anna wants to get out of India immediately but Mr More tells Anna that the city's borders are sealed, and will find cops at every step as they are on high alert so have some patience. Anna responds to this that why did I spent so much money on you and your elections? Just to hear this from you? If the roads are closed then take me via air route? Why are the choppers kept in Mumbai? Get me out of here within 24 hours or else I'll have to get real tough with you people. Upon hearing this they both tell Anna that the nearest helipad is in Pune and we have to go there by road, if we go by a private vehicle the cops will get suspicious. Then Sr Inspector Pisal comes with a solution, that he will arrange a truck, in which Anna will sit in a material bag along with the goods and escape. After a while they leave Anna and after coming out Mr More out of fear, tells Sr Inspector Pisal that Anna provides the money for contesting his elections and then he makes us dance on his tunes, now go and arrange the truck.

At mid evening Maruti arrives at the farmhouse one hour early, he comes at the main door but is greeted by a dog, he runs away and climbs on to the second floor through the help of pipes and coming inside the house via balcony. While coming down through the stairs Maruti spots Anna & Mr More drinking Alcohol, Mr More complains to Anna about the Home Minister being an honest fellow. Anna assures Mr More, that once the situation cools down he'll come back and drive this Home Minister away. Mr More then tells Anna that he has bought a special gift for him and goes inside to get it. Maruti shocked and witnessing all this discussion comes down and hides between the expensive statues placed in the farmhouse. Mr More returns laughing and tells Anna that if the driver Maruti Kamble acts smart then what will you do and gives him a pistol. Anna gets happy seeing this pistol and starts shooting the statues, due to being high on alcohol they see Maruti Kamble as a standing statue, Anna aims at Maruti but at exact moment Maruti bends down and misses the bullet.

It states that an even number is perfect if and only if it has the form , where is a prime number. The theorem is named after Euclid and Leonhard Euler. It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. Although the truth of this conjecture remains unknown, it is equivalent, by the Euclid–Euler theorem, to the conjecture that there are infinitely many even perfect numbers. However, it is also unknown whether there exists even a single odd perfect number. Statement A perfect number is a natural number that equals the sum of its proper divisors, the numbers that are less than it and divide it evenly (with remainder zero). For instance, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, which sum to 6, so 6 is perfect. A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form ; for a number of this form to be prime, itself must also be prime. The Euclid–Euler theorem states that an even natural number is perfect if and only if it has the form , where is a Mersenne prime.. History Euclid proved that is an even perfect number whenever is prime (Euclid, Prop. IX.36). This is the final result on number theory in Euclid's Elements; the later books in the Elements instead concern irrational numbers, solid geometry, and the golden ratio. Euclid expresses the result by stating that if a finite geometric series beginning at 1 with ratio 2 has a prime sum , then this sum multiplied by the last term in the series is perfect. Expressed in these terms, the sum of the finite series is the Mersenne prime and the last term in the series is the power of two . Euclid proves that is perfect by observing that the geometric series with ratio 2 starting at , with the same number of terms, is proportional to the original series; therefore, since the original series sums to , the second series sums to , and both series together add to , two times the supposed perfect number. However, these two series are disjoint from each other and (by the primality of ) exhaust all the divisors of , so has divisors that sum to , showing that it is perfect.. Over a millennium after Euclid, Alhazen conjectured that even perfect number is of the form where is prime, but he was not able to prove this result. It was not until the 18th century that Leonhard Euler proved that the formula will yield all the even perfect numbers.. Originally read to the Berlin Academy on February 23, 1747, and published posthumously. See in particular section 8, p. 88. Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes; each Mersenne prime generates one even perfect number, and vice versa. Proof Euler's proof is short and depends on the fact that the sum of divisors function is multiplicative; that is, if and are any two relatively prime integers, then . For this formula to be valid, the sum of divisors of a number must include the number itself, not just the proper divisors. A number is perfect if and only if its sum of divisors is twice its value. =Sufficiency= One direction of the theorem (the part already proved by Euclid) immediately follows from the multiplicative property: every Mersenne prime gives rise to an even perfect number. When is prime, :\\\\sigma(2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)) = \\\\sigma(2^{p-1})\\\\sigma(2^p - 1). The divisors of are . The sum of these divisors is a geometric series whose sum is . Next, since is prime, its only divisors are and itself, so the sum of its divisors is . Combining these, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma(2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)) &= \\\\sigma(2^{p-1})\\\\sigma(2^p - 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (2^p - 1)(2^p) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2(2^{p-1})(2^p - 1). \\\\end{align} Therefore, is perfect.... =Necessity= In the other direction, suppose that an even perfect number has been given, and partially factor it as , where is odd. For to be perfect, the sum of its divisors must be twice its value: The odd factor on the right side of (∗) is at least 3, and it must divide , the only odd factor on the left side, so is a proper divisor of . Dividing both sides of (∗) by the common factor and taking into account the known divisors and of gives :2^{k+1}y = \\\\sigma(x) = x + y + \\\\text{other divisors} = 2^{k+1}y + \\\\text{other divisors}. For this equality to be true, there can be no other divisors. Therefore, must be , and must be a prime of the form .

The event took place on October 13, 2014, in Tokyo at Ryōgoku Kokugikan and featured ten matches, six of which were contested for championships. It was the third event under the King of Pro-Wrestling name. Storylines King of Pro-Wrestling featured ten professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre- existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The entire card for the event was revealed on September 24, 2014, the day after Destruction in Okayama. The event featured two matches involving championships from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In the first, the debuting Chase Owens was set to defend the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. Owens' debut was announced in a vignette at Destruction in Okyama, after which he was instantly challenged by Bushi. The second would feature the NJPW tag team Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) making their fifth defense of the NWA World Tag Team Championship against previous champions K.E.S. (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer). At Destruction in Okayama, the Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida) successfully defended their IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against El Desperado and Taichi, after which they were challenged by both Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson), leading to King of Pro- Wrestling, where the three teams would face off in a three-way match for the title. Meanwhile, El Desperado, who had attacked IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Ryusuke Taguchi at Destruction in Kobe, was set to challenge Taguchi for the junior heavyweight singles title. Also at Destruction in Okayama, Bullet Club's Yujiro Takahashi successfully defended the NEVER Openweight Championship against Chaos' Yoshi-Hashi, after which he was confronted by Yoshi-Hashi's stablemate, the previous NEVER Openweight Champion Tomohiro Ishii. At King of Pro-Wrestling Takahashi and Ishii were set to face off in another title match, a rematch from June 29 and the Kizuna Road 2014 event. In the semi-main event, Kazuchika Okada was booked to defend his certificate for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, which he had obtained by winning the 2014 G1 Climax, against Tetsuya Naito. During G1 Climax, Okada had been defeated by Naito, which resulted in him nominating Naito as his next challenger for the certificate. In the main event, Bullet Club's A.J. Styles would make his third defense of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hiroshi Tanahashi. After failing to capture the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Okada at the 2013 King of Pro- Wrestling, Tanahashi announced that he was leaving the title picture. However, after defeating Katsuyori Shibata at Destruction in Kobe, Tanahashi announced he was back and looking for a shot at A.J. Styles. Tanahashi and Styles previously faced off in Ryōgoku Kokugikan on February 17, 2008, and more recently met in a special non-tournament singles match during the final day of the 2014 G1 Climax. Tanahashi won the match, but was afterwards attacked by Bullet Club's newest member, Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett did not make another appearance for NJPW for two months, but was working behind the scenes on getting Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome broadcast on the American PPV market. On September 29, Jarrett announced he was returning to NJPW at King of Pro- Wrestling. Event In the second match of the event, the debuting Chase Owens successfully defended the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. After the match, NWA president Bruce Tharpe, who had accompanied Owens to the ring, nominated NJPW wrestler Jyushin Thunder Liger as the next challenger for Owens' title. In the following match, Tencozy's six-month reign as the NWA World Tag Team Champions came to an end as they were defeated by K.E.S. in their fifth title defense. Post-match, Kojima and Tenzan began arguing with each other, setting up a potential break-up storyline. In the third title match of the event, Time Splitters made their third successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, defeating Forever Hooligans and The Young Bucks in a three-way match. This was followed by Ryusuke Taguchi also successfully defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against El Desperado, despite a pre-match attack by El Desperado's Suzuki-gun stablemates Taichi and Taka Michinoku. Following the match, Taichi and Michinoku attacked Taguchi once more. In the fifth title match, Tomohiro Ishii became the first ever two-time NEVER Openweight Champion by defeating Yujiro Takahashi in his second title defense. The event also featured a tag team match, where Hirooki Goto and Katsuyori Shibata defeated Shinsuke Nakamura and Yoshi-Hashi, with Shibata pinning Yoshi-Hashi for the win. After the match, Nakamura nominated Shibata as his next challenger for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. In the semi-main event, 2014 G1 Climax winner Kazuchika Okada defeated 2013 G1 Climax winner Tetsuya Naito to retain his status as the number one contender to the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at the Tokyo Dome. Finally, in the main event, A.J. Styles, accompanied by Jeff Jarrett, defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hiroshi Tanahashi. Towards the end of the match, as Jarrett went to interfere in the match, Yoshitatsu made his return to NJPW after a seven-year stint in WWE and stopped his attempt. This was followed by Tanahashi hitting Styles with the High Fly Flow to win the match and become the IWGP Heavyweight Champion for the record- breaking seventh time. The event concluded with Tanahashi having a staredown with Kazuchika Okada, setting up the main event for Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the show \\"excellent\\", giving the highest rating of four and a half stars out of five to the NEVER Openweight Championship match, calling it \\"the best singles match with Takahashi that [he had] ever seen\\". Meltzer gave the lowest rating of two stars to the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship match, writing that the debuting Chase Owens \\"seemed out of his league here, both in look and work\\". Overall, Meltzer called King of Pro-Wrestling \\"excellent show by most standards\\", while also noting that NJPW had produced better shows earlier in the year, calling the matches before the intermission (matches 1–6) \\"so-so\\". In reviewing the show for the Pro Wrestling Torch, Sean Radican gave the highest rating of four and a half stars out of five to both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship match and the match between Okada and Naito. Overall, Radican called the show \\"amazing\\".

She wrote important books on the subject, and had great influence on the development of teaching group work concepts. Life Grace Longwell Coyle was born in North Adams, Massachusetts in 1892. Her parents were John Patterson Coyle, a Congregational minister, and Mary Cushman Coyle. Her brother, David Cushman Coyle (1887–1969) wrote popular books on economics and public policy, and was appointed to Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"Brain Trust\\". She graduated from Drury High School in 1910. Grace Coyle received her bachelor's degree in 1914 from Wells Lake College. She won a scholarship from the College Settlement Association to attend the New York School of Philanthropy in 1915, where she studied social work and earned a diploma in 1915. She worked as a volunteer at a Boston settlement house while at college. From 1915–1917 Coyle was a settlement house worker in the coal mining region of northeast Pennsylvania, dealing with new immigrants and factory workers. From 1917–18 she was a field worker with the YWCA in Pittsburgh. From 1918–1926 she was industrial secretary for the YWCA national board in New York City. In this role she was responsible for development of education and recreation programs for adult women in industrial jobs. In 1923 she developed one of the first group work courses at the School of Applied Social Sciences of Western Reserve University, Cleveland. Later, she earned a master's degree in economics in 1928 and a doctoral degree in sociology from Columbia University in 1931. Her doctoral thesis Social Progress in Organized Groups was published as a book in 1930. She is known for her development of the scientific approach to group work practice. Her work, teaching, and writing experiences were related to her interest in group work.NASW Foundation (2004).

Fredriksen-Goldsen, et al., \\"'My Ever Dear': Social Work's 'Lesbian' Foremothers - A Call for Scholarship\\" _Affilia: Journal of Women and Social Work_ Vol. 24 No. 3 (August 2009) Concepts Grace Coyle made a major contribution through her speeches and writings to acceptance of group work as a component of social work. She felt that group work and case work were compatible and complementary, each would gain by being integrated with the other, and the result would be better service to clients. In her view, group workers required greater awareness of issues of personality and family relationships. Through familiarity with case work the group workers would understand the how a group experience could have therapeutic potential. Case workers needed more understanding of group dynamics and leisure activities.

After writing the song, Nelson moved to Houston, Texas, where due to his financial issues, tried to sell it to Larry Butler. Butler, who rejected to buy the song, employed Nelson instead. After his original songs turned into a hits for other artists, Nelson was signed as a recording artist by Liberty Records. Nelson recorded the song during his second session for the label in Radio Recorders. The song was included as the B-side of the promotional single for ...And Then I Wrote. \\"Mr. Record Man\\" received successful Jukebox and airplay in Texas. Background In 1957, Nelson lived in Fort Worth, Texas. He quit the music business for a year, becoming a salesman. During this time, he was inspired to write \\"Mr. Record Man\\", while he was driving on the highway with the radio turned on. He penned the song about a man, who after listening to a song on his car radio, feels compelled to buy the record, relating the words of the song to his own lost love and sadness. After his son Billy was born in 1958, struggling with financial issues, he moved to Houston, Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the Esquire Ballroom to sell songs to house band singer Larry Butler. Butler refused to purchase Nelson's songs, including \\"Mr. Record Man\\", giving him instead a US$50 loan to rent an apartment and a six- night job singing in the club. During his time in Houston, Nelson sold his original \\"Family Bible\\", that turned into a hit for Claude Gray. Despite that he was not credited as the songwriter on the record, he took advantage of the recognition that the song granted him, and moved to Nashville in 1960. While he joined Ray Price's band as a bass player, his songs became hits for other artists, including \\"Funny How Time Slips Away\\" (Billy Walker), \\"Pretty Paper\\" (Roy Orbison), and, most famously, \\"Crazy\\" by Patsy Cline.  Recordings Leveraged by his prominence as a songwriter, he was signed as a recording artist by Liberty Records in 1961. For his second session with the label, producer Joe Allison took Nelson to Radio Recorders, on September 11–12, 1961. Nelson's backing included: Billy Strange, Roy Nichols and Johnny Western on guitars; pianist Jim Pierce; bassists Red Wootten and Ray Pohlman; and drummer Roy Harte. During the recording, the backup singers could not follow Nelson's lead singing for his off-beat phrasing. To solve the issue, Allison placed baffles between Nelson and the backup so they could not see each other. Recorded as a 4/4 Ray Price Shuffle, \\"Mr. Record Man\\" was selected as the B-side for the first Willie Nelson single for Liberty Records, and the single to ...And Then I Wrote. The song from his first session, \\"The Part Where I Cry\\" was selected as the A-side. On its release in November 1961, Billboard considered the single to have a \\"moderate sales potential\\". The single sold 4,000 copies. While \\"Mr. Record Man\\" received radio and jukebox play in Texas, it failed to chart. It was re-recorded in 1965 for Nelson's RCA Records debut album Country Willie – His Own Songs. In 1966, he named his road band \\"The Record Men\\". The same year, the song was recorded for the live album Country Music Concert at Panther Hall. Nelson recorded again the song for his 1989 album A Horse Called Music.

He is also a contributing researcher with Encyclopedia Titanica, specializing in Canada's role in retrieving the Titanic bodies from the sea and their burials in three Halifax graveyards. Knuckle is also a prolific public speaker who has addressed over 200 service clubs. His topics include presentations about his books and plays and include a power-point presentation on Canada and the Titanic which deals with the aftermath of the Titanic tragedy. Education and early career Robert acted and wrote sports columns in high school and university. After graduating from the University of Windsor, he earned his M. Ed. from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. He then pursued a lengthy career in education as an English and Latin teacher and high school administrator in Hamilton, Ontario. He also coached basketball and football in several high schools and at McMaster University in Hamilton. Upon retiring from education he became the general manager of the Hamilton Skyhawks of the World Basketball League. When that league folded in 1992, Knuckle began to write full-time. In 1984, while engaged as a vice-principal, he and his writing partner Gordon Carruth, a Hamilton Secondary School principal, wrote a play about the life of fabled National Football League (NFL) coach Vince Lombardi entitled I Am Not a Legend. It became very successful playing in Hamilton; Toronto; Windsor; Coventry, England; Edinburgh, Scotland; Lahr, Germany and Green Bay, Wisconsin. I Am Not a Legend was also televised and aired on ESPN in the USA. Knuckle and Carruth also adapted their Legend script for CBC Radio for which they both won ACTRA Awards for writing. In all these various productions of Legend Knuckle played the role of Vince Lombardi.

He was the highest-priced European yearling of his generation and won four of his sixteen races between July 1975 and October 1977. After winning one race as a two-year-old in 1975 he showed improved form in the early part of the following year, winning the 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes and finishing second to Empery in The Derby. The rest of his three-year-old career was disappointing but he reached his peak in 1977, winning the Lockinge Stakes over a mile and then recording an upset victory in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing, he had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Relkino was a \\"very attractive, well-made\\" bay horse with a white blaze and a white coronet on his right front foot bred by Cleaboy Farms. He was sired by Relko, the French-trained winner of the 1963 Epsom Derby. His dam, Pugnacity, was a \\"grand racemare\\" (rated 117 by Timeform), whose wins included the Lowther Stakes, Falmouth Stakes and King George Stakes. She produced several other winners including Triumphant, who in turn produced the Irish Champion Stakes winner Timarida. As a descendant of the broodmare Ballisland, Pugnacity was a distant relative of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Tarascon. As a yearling, the colt was offered for sale and bought for 58,000 guineas by the trainer Dick Hern, acting on behalf of Marcia Anastasia Christoforides, Lady Beaverbrook. The price was the highest paid at auction for any yearling in Britain in 1974. Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko, Petoski), as this was the most common form for Derby winners. Relkino was sent into training with Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Relkino was a very headstrong animal with a tendency to bolt: Willie Carson, who rode the horse in some of his major victories admitted that \\"I couldn't hold one side of him the first time I rode him work\\". Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= Relkino made his debut in the Ecchinswell Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in July, in which he took the lead at half distance and drew away to win \\"very comfortably\\" by four lengths. A month later, over the same course and distance, he started odds-on favourite for the Washington Singer Stakes but ran poorly and finished last of the five runners behind Lady Beaverbrook's other runner Homeboy. =1976: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Relkino won the 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in April, leading from the start to beat the Reg Akehurst-trained Loh by three-quarters of a length. In May he contested the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and finished sixth of the seventeen runners behind Wollow, Vitiges, Thieving Demon, Patris and Frankie. On 2 June 1976, Relkino was one of twenty-three runners for the 197th running of the Derby Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Starting a 25/1 outsider he was among the leaders from the start, turned into the straight in third place behind Vitiges and moved to the front approaching the final quarter mile. He maintained his advantage until the final furlong, when he was overtaken by the French-trained Empery and finished second, three lengths behind the winner and a head in front of Oats. The rest of Relkino's second season was disappointing. He finished unplaced behind the subsequently disqualified Trepan in the Eclipse Stakes in which he appeared to be \\"thoroughly outpaced\\" and then finished fifth behind Hawkberry in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse. In the latter race he led in the straight but dropped away quickly after being headed a furlong and a half from the finish. In the Valdoe Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in September, he was beaten a length by Obstacle, a three-year-old colt trained by Henry Candy, to whom he was conceding nine pounds. On his final appearance of the season, Relkino was badly-drawn in stall 1 for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket and finished eleventh of the twenty runners behind Vitiges. =1977: four-year-old season= Relkino began his third season in the Westbury Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse in April, in which he led from the start, setting a very fast pace, before being overtaken in the closing stages and finishing second by three quarters of a length to the Henry Cecil-trained Lucky Wednesday. He was then dropped in distance for the Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury in May in which he was ridden by Willie Carson and started at odds of 4/1. He was among the leaders from the start and got the better of a prolonged struggle with Jellaby and Thieving Demon to record his first win in over a year. In the Diomed Stakes at Epsom in June, Relkino finished sixth in an unsatisfactory race in which he was forced into the rails and repeatedly bitten by the subsequently disqualified Marinsky. He continued to campaign over a mile, but was well-beaten when finishing fourth to Jellaby in the Queen Anne Stakes after disputing the early lead. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July he was beaten again, finishing third to the Eclipse Stakes winner Artaius. In August started a 33/1 outsider for the sixth running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse, with the betting being headed by Artaius. The other runners included the previously undefeated French colt Lightning, the Hardwicke Stakes winner Orange Bay, the Irish Derby winner Malacate, and the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Sarah Siddons. The race also attracted Smuzka and Negros, two Polish horses who were the first horses from behind the Iron Curtain to race in Britain. Willie Carson settled the colt toward the middle of the field as Artaius and Negros disputed the early lead. Relkino moved forward in the straight, overtook Artaius approaching the final furlong and accelerated away to win by four lengths with Orange Bay finishing third. As in the previous year, Relkino ended his season with a run in the Champion Stakes, but produced a much better performance. Restrained towards the back of the eight-runner field he moved forward in the final quarter mile to contest the lead with Arctic Tern, North Stoke and Flying Water. He was unable to withstand the finishing burst of Flying Water and finished second, two lengths behind the winner and two and a half lengths ahead of North Stoke in third. Assessment In 1975, Relkino was not awarded a weight in the British Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to race in the United Kingdom, which was headed by Wollow. He was given a rating of 104 by the independent Timeform organisation, twenty-six pounds below their top-rated juvenile Manado. In the following year, Relkino was rated sixteen pounds inferior to Vitiges in the British Free Handicap for three-year-olds. He was given a rating of 123 by Timeform, twelve pounds behind their Horse of the Year Youth: in their annual Racehorse of 1976, Timeform commented that the colt seemed to be \\"no longer as keen on racing as he was\\". In the inaugural International Classification in 1977, Relkino was rated equal with Exceller as the sixth-best older horse in Europe behind Balmerino, Orange Bay, Buckskin, Gentilhombre and Sagaro. Timeform gave him a rating of 131, two pounds behind their top-rated older male Balmerino. Stud career In the autumn of 1977, following his win at York, Relkino was syndicated at £8,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of £320,000. He began his stud career in 1978 at the Barton Stud at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk and was later based at Chris Sweetings' Conduit Stud near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. He had limited success as a sire of flat racers, with the best of his offspring being the Scottish Derby winner Dazari. He was more successful as a National Hunt stallion, siring Relkeel a three-time of the Bula Hurdle who was described by David Nicholson as \\"the best horse I ever trained\\", as well as Arctic Kinsman (Supreme Novices' Hurdle) and Buckhouse Boy (Rendlesham Hurdle). His last foals were born in 1990.

On July 13, 2016, governor Jay Nixon signed Senate Bill 588 in to law, which expands the opportunities available for expungement of criminal convictions in Missouri. The new law will go into effect January 1, 2018.  Ordinary expungement  If certain requirements are met, Missouri law allows a person to have an arrest record expunged, which the law of Missouri defines as the process of legally destroying, obliterating or striking out records or information in files, computers and other depositories relating to criminal charges.Chapter 610, Revised Statutes of Missouri (R.S.Mo.) A person is eligible for expungement in Missouri if the arrest was based on false information and the following conditions exist: #There is no probable cause to believe the person committed the offense; #No charges will be pursued as a result of the arrest; #The person has no prior or subsequent misdemeanor or felony convictions; #The person did not receive a suspended imposition of sentence for the offense; and #No civil action is pending relating to the arrest or records sought to be expunged. If a person qualifies, in order to have the records expunged, they must file a verified petition for expungement in the civil division of the Circuit Court in the county of the arrest. The court sets a hearing on the matter no sooner than thirty days after the petition was filed. If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to expungement of any record, it will enter an order directing expungement. Records expunged under this provision still may be opened to law enforcement if the person is charged with a subsequent offense or if any of the requirements of expungement no longer are met.  The Missouri Expungement Law Senate Bill 588  With the 2018 Missouri Expungement Law, a process has been created where around 1,900 eligible offenses can be sealed. Some individuals with misdemeanor convictions can file petitions after three years and those with felonies, after seven years. That waiting time used to be 10 and 20 years respectively. This law opens the door for thousands of offenders to petition the courts to seal or remove their records of arrests and convictions as of January 1, 2018. After a successful petition those with no other criminal record, will be able to honestly answer “no” to inquiries about whether they have a criminal record (Unless a specific employer is required by law to exclude certain applicants). For individuals who are eligible to start their petition process they have to file them in the court where they were charged or found guilty of the crime (offenses, violations, infractions). The petition must include all names of municipal prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement agencies, courts, state repositories of criminal records – basically any entity that might possess records of the items they wish to have expunged. They must also list every offense they wish to have expunged. The state will then have 30-days to file objections to the petition you have filed. If there is an objection the court must hold a hearing within 60-days, or 30-days if there is no objection. While the 3 and 7 year waiting period has been stated, the bill does not explicitly demand this, so there might be avenues open for an earlier expungement date. The individual will also have to show the court that their habits and personal conduct, since their release, make them a good candidate for expungement. This is the key element to the success of their petition. The petition process can take as little as 120-days resulting in a removal of their criminal record from potential landlords, employers and financial institution immediately.  Minor in possession of alcohol  In 2005, the Missouri General Assembly enacted a special new section in the state's Liquor Control Law allowing for the complete and total expungement for the offense of being a minor in possession of alcohol.Section 311.326, R.S.Mo. Unlike ordinary expungement, the MIP expungement exists with the explicit legislative mandate that the effect of an order of expungement under it \\"shall be to restore such person to the status occupied prior to such arrest, plea or conviction, as if such event had never happened.\\" After not less than one year since the offense was disposed of, or upon reaching the age of twenty-one, whichever occurs first, a person who pleaded guilty to or was found guilty of the crime of minor in possession of alcohol for the first time, and who since such conviction has not been convicted of any other alcohol-related offense, may apply to the civil division of the circuit court of the county in which the person was sentenced for an order to expunge all official records of the arrest, plea, trial and conviction. The person also must meet the following requirements: #The person has not been convicted of any other alcohol-related offense at the time of the application for expungement; and #The person has had no other contacts with law enforcement (i.e. arrest, charge) which were alcohol-related (such as for drunk driving or violation of the terms of a liquor license). If a person has had an MIP record expunged this way, the law states they cannot \\"be held thereafter under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial, conviction or expungement in response to any inquiry made for any purpose whatsoever.\\" A person is only entitled to one MIP expungement under this special provision.

History After the successful British invasion of the previously Dutch territory of Java in 1811 (part of the wider Napoleonic Wars of the time), Lieutenant-Governor Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company sent the private merchant Alexander Hare to the region and appointed him Resident of Banjarmasin and Commissioner of the Island of Borneo (1811–16). Hare then acquired 1,400 square miles of land from the Sultan of Banjarmasin stretching along the coast from the mouth of the Barito River to Tanjong Selatan and inland to the north up to the Sungei Matapura. It was mostly marshland mixed with areas of grassland and some forest with a number of villages located on or near the coast. Hare established his land as an independent state which he ran as a private fiefdom, with the title of Rajah of Maluka. Maluka had a flag, issued coinage and collected customs duties. Thus he can be called the first White Rajah in Borneo, 30 years before James Brooke established his own White Rajahs dynasty in Sarawak. Hare's activity came under great scrutiny with the British East India Company concerned about his use of company funds for the development of Maluka. There were also allegations that people had been forcibly relocated to the colony as a source of labour. A Commission of Inquiry, formed in 1816, investigated both charges, finding a great deal to complain about in terms of Hare's accounting. The Inquiry also faulted him with being aware that a number of females had been kidnapped and brought to the colony. However, the more series charge, alleged by William Boggie, that he had enslaved over three thousand people was found to be unsupportable. William Boggie had his own grievances with Raffles, recorded in a letter written by his advocate James Simpson in 1834, and likely raised the issue as a means to discredit him -- Raffles was widely known to detest the practice of slavery and if one of his appointees was found to be engaging in the practice on a massive scale it would have been extremely embarrassing. What is certain is that Hare faced a labour shortage that unless overcome would have made the development of his colony impossible. To overcome this obstacle, in 1812 he asked Raffles to have convicts from Java transported to Banjarmasin as part of their sentences as well as to encourage destitute individuals to migrate. The latter group was to be provided with assistance. Both could take their families, if they wished. However, the majority of both groups were single males and so, in order to rectify the imbalance, the authorities were enjoined to encourage female migration by offering a sum of money or release from debt. The signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, part of the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, was the beginning of the end for Hare's dream of an independent state. Although both Raffles and his successor as Lieutenant General, John Fendall, resisted Dutch requests for the Borneo colonies to be returned as they considered them deserted by the Dutch rather than conquered by the British and hence not falling under the terms of the treaty, this was not the position of the EIC as a whole. In January of 1817 a Dutch representative signed a treaty giving them control of much territory around Banjarmasin in return for supporting the Sultan against his local and regional enemies. It is likely that Hare could have kept his estate despite this change of authority, but he antagonized the Dutch, making them feel that he was interested in using the estate as a springboard for further British intrusions on what they saw as their political and economic interests in the region. As a result in 1818 the new Dutch government declared that Hare had no legal right to the property (the Sultan having conveniently lost the earlier treaty he had signed with Hare), ordering the local Dutch contingent to take control of the land, by force if necessary. This was done in July 1818.

It is intended to represent the passion of Jesus Christ and its name after the Calvary, the hill in Jerusalem where, according to tradition, Jesus was crucified. Sacro Monte di Domodossola Calvary hill in Maria Lanzendorf (1700) These function as greatly expanded versions of the Stations of the Cross that are usual in Catholic churches, allowing the devout to follow the progress of the stages of the Passion of Christ along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem. Each chapel contains a large image of the scene from the Passion it commemorates, sometimes in sculpture, that may be up to life-size. This kind of shrine was especially popular in the Baroque period when the Holy Land was under Turkish rule and it was difficult to make a pilgrimage to the Mount Calvary in Jerusalem. Calvaries were especially popular with the Franciscan and Jesuit orders, and are most common in Italy and Habsburg Central Europe. They were usually placed in parks near a church or a monastery, typically on a hill which the visitor gradually ascends. Italian ones are usually called a sacro monte (\\"holy mountain\\" or \\"hill\\"); there are a group of nine Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy that are especially notable; their dates of foundation vary between 1486 and 1712. Devotions would be most popular in Passion Week, before Easter, when large processions around the stations would be held, and mystery plays might be acted. If a calvary was established in an inhabited place, it might result in a location of a new village or town. Several villages and towns are named after such a complex.  Terminology  The Mount of Calvary was the site outside the gates of Jerusalem where the crucifixion of Christ took place. The scene was replicated around the world in numerous \\"calvary hills\\" after the Counter-Reformation and they are used by Roman Catholics in particular as part of their worship and veneration of God. The term is derived from the Latin translation in the Vulgate of the Aramaic name for original hill, Golgotha, where it was called calvariae locus, Latin for \\"the place of the skull\\".Bibliotheca Augustana: Hieronimi Vulgata, Evangelium Secondum Lucam, 23:33 Martin Luther translated Golgatha as \\"skull place\\" (Scheddelstet). This translation is debated; at the very least it is not clear whether it referred to the shape of the hill, its use as a place of execution or burial or refers to something else.\\"Mount Calvary\\" article in the Catholic Encyclopedia (English) \\"Calvary hill\\" today refers to a roughly life-size depiction of the scene of crucifixion with crucifixes, usually the cross of Jesus and the two criminals, but many are more elaborate, including sculptures of additional figures. These scenes of the crucifixion are set up on small hillocks, which may be natural or artificial. Often 14 or so stations of the cross are laid out on the way up to the pilgrimage hill and there is often a small, remote church or chapel located between a few dozen to several hundred metres away. Calvary hills are also a symbol of Brittany, where they were built during the Breton Renaissance (between 1450 and the 17th century) especially in the Finistère in specially created parish closes. Of great importance was the erection of calvary hills north of the Alps in the Baroque era during the Counter-Reformation.

It was a separate municipality but became administratively a part of Těrlicko in 1975. It has a population of around 830 and a territory of 781,1 ha. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The village was indirectly attested in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 which mentioned Grodische villa Snessonis. However it was written in an atypical form and suggests that a village was older. There should be another village named similarly, and even older from Snesson's village. Because Grodische villa Snessonis was listed among villages located between Skoczów and Czechowice it is undoubtly linked to nowadays Grodziec, whereas the other Grodische, not mentioned in Liber fundationis... is associated with Grodziszcz, in Czech Hradiště, now part of Těrlicko in the Czech Republic. As in the case of the other Grodische the name suggests that there existed a fortificated wooden gord. Thus it could have existed earlier in 13th century within Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland transformed into the Duchy of Teschen, ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Later it was mentioned as Hradysscze (1447, 1450), Hradisstie (1520), Hradisscze (1523), Grodisscze (1607) and similarly but losing the ending -e (e.g. Grodischtz, 1736, 1804). After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 843 in 1880 to 785 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish- speakers (between 97.2% and 99.9%) accompanied by a German-speaking people (at most 13 or 1.7% in 1910) and Czech-speaking (at most 8 or 1.1% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (50.7%), followed by Roman Catholics (47.1%), Jews (8 or 1%) and 9 people adhering to another faiths. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

Clark’s subject matter was the diaspora of African American culture, including dance scenes, street urchins, marine life, landscapes, and religious and political satire images executed primarily with a palette knife.  Early life  Claude Clark was born on a tenant farm in Rockingham, Georgia November 11, 1915. In early August 1923, Clark’s parents left the south for a better life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the Great Migration. Clark attended Roxborough High School where he wrote poetry but also discovered a talent for painting. His Sunday School teacher encouraged him to exhibit in Sunday school class and at church. Clark studied at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now the University of the Arts (Philadelphia)), (1935-1939), following high school graduation. He applied to and was eventually accepted to the Barnes Foundation in 1939. In 1941, Claude met the daughter of an African Methodist Episcopal Church minister, Effie May Lockhart from California. They married in June 1943 and formed a dynamic “power” partnership in art, education and philosophy. He continued his paint studies at The Barnes Foundation while teaching art in the Philadelphia Public School system during the early years of their marriage. The couple moved to Alabama and finally California while continuing their careers. Claude Clark working with Dox Thrash During the Great Depression Clark contacted the Artists Union for work through the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He worked with the WPA from 1939 – 1942. Clark joined the graphics art shop where he worked with Raymond Seth and Dox Thrash. Clark was the subject of many articles and publications. He also was the author of A Black Art Perspective, a Black Teachers Guide to a Black Visual Arts Curriculum, Merritt Press 1970. As a member of the Black West Coast Arts Movement he co-developed the first African American Studies curriculum. He also mentored and supported many young emerging scholars and artists.  Education  Claude Clark working with a palette knife. Claude Clark attended high school in Philadelphia, PA, graduating from Roxborough High School. From 1935 - 1939, Clark studied at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (later the University of the Arts) on full scholarship. While studying there, he came across the work of Van Gogh. Van Gogh's style and method formed the basis of Clark's approach to drawing and painting, with thick creamy texture and loosely applied paint using a palette knife. In 1939 Clark applied to the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania and was accepted. Clark studied at Barnes from 1939 – 1944. The Albert Barnes collection consisted of an array of works that included African art, European Impressionism and American art. He was able to investigate the hundreds of original “old masters” in the collection and modernist works and to study first hand one of the first important collections of African art in America. While studying at Barnes in 1939, Clark found a job through the Federal Arts Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He also performed independent research from 1944 – 1958. Clark moved his family to Talladega, Alabama and subsequently Sacramento, California. He received a BA from Sacramento State University in 1958 and a Master of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962.  Painter and art educator  \\"Guttersnipe\\" is an oil painting on wood panel done in 1942 by Claude Clark. It is part of the M H de Young Memorial Museum collection in San Francisco, CA Clark matured in art by recognizing his opportunity to develop without being constrained by the racism, poverty and inherent inequality of circumstance prejudice and labels bring. His work exhibited social realism, modern and abstract styles. When Clark could not afford paint, he salvaged throw away paint cans from trash bins in the back of art schools and mixed his own. Unable to afford to buy paint brushes and chemicals to clean them, he mastered use of the palette knife. Clark painted and exhibited from a very early age and sold his first works in his early twenties. Collectors continue to seek Clark’s works 70 years later. Clark worked at various jobs throughout the late 1930s and mid 1940s before accepting a position as an art instructor with Philadelphia Public school in 1945 – 1948. Clark became interested in working for a Black college as his interest in African and African American history developed further. He accepted a position at Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama as an Associate Professor of Art (1948 – 1955). Clark painted, taught, exhibited and researched his interest further while supporting his family consisting of a wife Diama (Effie), son Claude Lockhart Clark and daughter Alice. “Freedom Morning” is a transparent watercolor done on paper in 1941 by Claude Clark. This painting was done in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is part of the . In 1955, while teaching at Talladega, Clark began feeling the financial pressures and made the decision to move his family to his wife’s native state of California to seek greater opportunity. Clark enrolled in Sacramento State University and taught art classes to other undergraduate students while simultaneously obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree. Following graduation in 1958, Clark accepted an art instruction position with Alameda County, California (1958 – 1967) and eventually secured a faculty position within the University of California system as an art instructor (Merritt College, 1968 – 1981).

He gave the task of directing to Madison, and he left for Tampa, Florida. \\"It was very nerve- racking\\", Madison told Jennie Kermode in an interview for Eye for Film. \\"I was really in at the deep end. But it turned out to be a really good decision because it was like a crash course in filmmaking and I learned a lot. Through it, I met Christopher Dane, who stars in Born of Hope, and Ollie Goodchild, who also appears in it.\\" Madison and Dane then collaborated on a short whimsical comedy film with the improbable subject of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. Dane portrayed Famine, Pestilence, War and Death in different costume and makeup for each. The four horsemen are the only customers at a pub and the hapless waitress, portrayed by Madison, does not know what to make of them. She directed the ten-minute short; Christopher Dane was the producer and screenwriter; the music was by Carl Homer.  Born of Hope  Madison became fascinated with The Lord of the Rings films directed by Peter Jackson; the films were her first exposure to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. She read Tolkien's own notes on the main characters of Middle Earth, and became intrigued about the mysterious background of Aragorn. \\"When I was looking for a story to do I found those few paragraphs and the idea of a film about Aragorn's parents and where he came from seemed a great idea\\", she stated in an interview. \\"Aragorn is such an important character in The Lord of the Rings but we know hardly anything about him until he turns up in The Prancing Pony in The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" From this creative spark, Madison set out to create what was then known as a fan film. In 2003 she discovered a Tolkien-fan film competition and decided to create a film on Aragorn's roots from the period just before that of the books and films. She began recruiting from her circle of film professionals within Actors at Work Productions, and their referrals of others throughout England and beyond. She brought in a screenwriter to flesh out the storyline, but the script evolved over a period of years and some scenes were rewritten during filming. She scouted for filming locations and discovered the West Stow Anglo-Saxon village and Epping Forest, where most of the scenes were ultimately filmed. Being familiar with Wales from her college days, she chose to film key scenes in the Welsh hills as well. She used the bulk of her own savings to launch the project, and ultimately called on donations to fund the balance. All actors and film crew worked without financial compensation. \\"We obviously didn't have very much money to spend so we couldn't exactly hire huge cranes and lights\\", she told an interviewer in 2010. \\"Most of our camera operators owned their own cameras and I also borrowed one off friends.\\" By 2006, Madison had produced a trailer which was shown at a Tolkien conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This generated interest in the film and the trailer was a fundraising vehicle. Principal photography finally began in 2008. Madison received offers to assist from professionals from around the world in providing special effects, film scoring, prop and costume donations and cash donations to keep production going. Born of Hope, with a running time of 71 minutes, made its debut at RingCon 2009 in Germany. Madison used the Internet for worldwide release, streamed first on Dailymotion, later on YouTube, and on the film's dedicated website. Madison played Arathorn's friend Elgarain in the film, as well as directing. The character \\"carries a torch\\" for Arathorn, demanding a major commitment to acting alongside the other demands on her during the shooting.  Ren: The Girl with the Mark  The online success of Born of Hope with millions of views since its release generated a worldwide following of Madison's creative works. The growth of online streaming media convinced Madison her future projects would best be served through this medium. She established a production company, Mythica Entertainment, to produce these works. The first of these is a new fantasy web series titled Ren: The Girl with the Mark. Ren follows the life of a young girl who is marked on her face by a spirit and who struggles to find the meaning of this mark, whether it is good or evil, and to overcoming the prejudice against her. Learning from her financial trials in filming Born of Hope, Madison launched a funding campaign using Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website, on 20 July 2013 with the goal of raising the £35,000 minimum need. By 19 August the goal was surpassed, raising £36,184. Season One of the series includes five ten-minute episodes, and is produced to be streamed over the web from the Mythica Entertainment website and possibly other online venues. The production team spent the first half of 2014 working on story lines, scouting locations, costume production, and calling for contributors for all aspects of the series. Filming for Season One began in the latter half of 2014 and was completed by mid-November. The first episode of Season One was uploaded to the Mythica Entertainment YouTube channel in 2016. \\"It's a great way for an independent film-maker to do something relatively low budget\\", Madison told the Cambridge News, \\"and get it out there, and get people watching it. I like the fact that with the web anyone can watch what you make, and that’s how it should be for me.\\" The principal cast of Ren stars Sophie Skelton as Ren, Nick Cornwall as Dagron (Ren's father), James Malpas as Baynon (Ren's brother), Christopher Dane as Karn, Duran Fulton Brown as Hunter, Grace Parry as Dalia, Alan Hay as Tor Berry, Dita Tan Tang as Lyanna, and Richard Zeman as the Kah'Nath Commander. A DVD with the five episodes is now available.

Conspirator Requeté taking oath, 1910s In 1898–1899 Lloréns took part in preparations for an aborted Carlist coup. He was among the hawks, pressing for insurgency against reluctance of the cautious leaders;Eduardo González Calleja, La razón de la fuerza: orden público, subversión y violencia política en la España de la Restauración (1875–1917), Madrid 1998, , 9788400077785, p. 195 the Alfonsist press widely considered him sort of clandestine Carlist “minister of war”.González Calleja 1998, p. 184 In 1905 Lloréns reported allusively to Carlos VII that anti-liberal demonstrators in Levante carried a high potential for rebellion.González Calleja 1998, p. 335 In 1910 the new Carlist claimant Don Jaime recognized Lloréns as chief military adviser by summoning him to the Frohsdorf residence and appointing him to re-organise Requeté, an organization set up 3 years earlier by Juan María Roma and originally designed as a sporting and outdoor grouping for 12- to 16-year-olds.Eduardo G. Calleja, Julio Aróstegui, La tradición recuperada: el Requeté Carlista y la insurrección, [in:] Historia Contemporanea 11 (1994), pp. 30-31 The move marked a major change in the Carlist war doctrine, shifting focus from conspiracy among professional officers to a popular militia rising.Aróstegui 2013, pp. 56-61 The plan envisioned that Requeté becomes less of a scouting group and more of a paramilitary organization. Lloréns, reporting to political Carlist leader Bartolomé Feliú Pérez (marqués de Cerralbo after 1912) and Don Jaime himself, strived to build a nationwide network; he wrote regulations for local and comarca units, nominated provincial and regional leaders, and set up Junta Central Tradicionalista Organizadora de los Requetés de Cataluña.Calleja, Aróstegui 1994, pp. 30-31 His intention was to bring more experienced military staff into the organization, so that under their command it could form local combat units capable of staging military action for the Carlist cause, should the opportunity arise.Aróstegui 2013, pp. 56-61 The only region where the organization developed into a significant structure was Catalonia, mostly thanks to the local Requeté commander, Matías Lloréns Palau.Matias Llorens and Joaquin Llorens were unrelated. On Matias Llorens' efforts see e.g. El Norte 15.10.13, available here or El Norte 03.12.13, available here Llorens 1913 The paramilitary build-up did not lead to action since despite the assassination of Canalejas, division within the conservatives, anarchist unrest and the looming European war, the situation in Spain remained fairly stable; belligerent enthusiasm of Requeté, Juventud JaimistaGonzález Calleja 1998, p. 490 and possibly Lloréns himself was frustrated.In 1913 Lloréns wrote to Don Jaime: “considero los actuales momentos tan graves que me hace reiterar mi súplica de que el Señor no se separe mucho de Espańa, porque pudiera surgir un acontencimiento tan inesperado como violento que hiciera precisa su presencia en la frontera”, quoted after Aróstegui 2013 p. 58 Eventually the organization scheme as created by Lloréns survived some 20 years, until it was restructured by José Luis Zamanillo. It actually slipped into a decline starting 1914, suffering from growing coolness between enthusiastically Germanophile LlorénsJulio Aróstegui 2013, p. 62 claims that Lloréns was an Aglophobe rather than a Germanophile and the Francophone claimant.for earlier tension between de Mella and Feliú and the role of Lloréns in the Carlist leadership see Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, El caso Feliú y el dominio de Mella en el partido carlista en el período 1909–1912, [in:] Historia contemporánea 10 (1997), , pp. 104, 113 and 114 It is possible that in the summer of 1917 Lloréns planned to provoke an unauthorized rebellion in Navarre, but these designs came to nothing.González Calleja 1998, p. 502 Requeté stagnated further on in 1916–1919, as in terms of popular mobilization Carlism was increasingly outpaced by the Conservatives.González Calleja 1998, p. 502 At the outbreak of the Mellista crisis in 1918 Llorens seemed disoriented;as the Valencian Jefe Regional he sent out a questionnaire sounding the opinion of provincial jefes, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ', Madrid 2000, , p. 162 since 1914 at odds with the Carlist king, accused of abuse of power and sidetracked,Aróstegui 2013, p. 63 he stayed loyal to his king.though some sources list him as taking part in the Mellist Junta Central, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 165 Defeated in Estella in 1919,Andrés Martín 2000, p. 175 he eventually withdrew from politics;González Calleja 1998, p. 502 other sources quote his declining health.Iturbide 1990, p. 718 By the end of his life he served as alcalde of Ontinyent,see Defunciones 1930 entry at Valenpedia, available here where he died during the very last months of the detested Alfonsist monarchy.ABC 12.11.1930, available here See also * Carlism * Third Carlist War * Restoration (Spain) * Requetés Footnotes Further reading * Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ', [in:] Historia contemporánea 10 (1997), * Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ', Madrid 2000, * Julio Aróstegui, ', Madrid 2013, * Sebastian Cerro Guerrero, ', [in:] Principe de Viana 49 (1988), * Jesús María Fuente Langas, ', [in:] ' 51 (1990), * Eduardo González Calleja, ', Madrid 1998, , 9788400077785 * Eduardo González Calleja, Julio Aróstegui, ', [in:] Historia Contemporanea 11 (1994) * Francisco de Paula, ', volume II, Barcelona 1888 External links * Terç de Montserrat roll of the dead video (in Catalan) * at Gran Enciclopedia Navarra * at Euskomedia * at Indice Historico de Diputados * Llorens family explained * father in detail * and municipal initiatives in Valencia * Llorens rifle registered * Melilla 1909 correspondence * and 1908 Segovia monument * and Estella barracks * and Onteniente * alcalde of Onteniente * having been hit by a bullet, a song from 3CW * obituary * Carlist siege of Bilbao song Category:1854 births Category:1930 deaths Category:People from Valencia Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Carlists Category:Members of the Congress of Deputies of the Spanish Restoration Category:Valencian politicians Category:Spanish colonels Category:Spanish essayists Category:Spanish male writers Category:Spanish inventors Category:Spanish mathematicians Category:Spanish military engineers Category:Valencian writers Category:19th- century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:20th-century Spanish painters Category:Male essayists ","title":"Joaquín Lloréns Fernández de Cordoba"},{"id":"43351714","text":"Eric Hamilton Crake (25 January 1886 – 3 February 1948) was an English cricketer.

Butler co-founded the Morristown School (now the Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey with former Harvard University classmates Francis Woodman and Thomas Quincy Brown. Early life and education Butler was born to Edward Knowles Butler and Frances Elizabeth Lewis Pierce on April 21, 1866 in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from the Roxbury Latin School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1884. Butler then received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1888. Following his graduation from college, he began working for the Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Company. Butler led the company's branch office in San Francisco and then started their branch office in Chicago. Teaching career Butler began his teaching career as an instructor at St. Bartholomew's School in Morristown, New Jersey. After reorganizing St. Bartholomew's School as the Morristown School, he served as an associate headmaster at the school (1898-1917). Upon the retirement of Woodman, Butler served as Morristown School's second headmaster until his retirement in 1926. George Tilghman succeeded him. Dedication to Allen Keith On November 27, 1921, a large fire destroyed the Rialto Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. Allen Keith, a student at Yale University and an alumnus of Morristown School, died while rescuing women and children fleeing the fire. Sharing a tribute to Keith, Butler wrote: \\"Though not a brilliant student, his grades were satisfactory. His response to the general school requirements was uniformly credible as shown in punctuality, physical training, and conduct, though there were occasional lapses in the latter quite characteristic of the prankishness of boyhood. Of a gentle and somewhat sensitive disposition, he was only just beginning to find channels for the expression of the more vigorous qualities. When he left Morristown, he was giving promise for good all-round development characteristic of a wholesome, normal boy.\\" Military career and war service Butler served with the Morristown Battalion of the New Jersey Militia Reserve. During World War I, he chaired the organization in Monroe, New Jersey that facilitated Liberty Loans, war bonds that supported military costs. Family Butler married Lydia Raquet Farnham on August 8, 1906. They had two children together: Arthur Pierce, Jr. and Edwin Farnham.

The film had the working title Omphalos. Plot A detective investigates a murder, only to find that the victim is... himself. Soon, he discovers multiple versions of himself, not all of them friendly. Darius Lefaux is a gumshoe detective. His career is in shambles, his romantic life is comically void, and his only real human connection a cantankerous old woman who lives next door. One day a murder comes in, and Darius is summoned to view the body. But there’s something very strange about this one. The body is ... him. The body is identical to Darius's. Memories begin to haunt Darius, fragments of events that don't make sense. As the plot thickens, more duplicates of Darius emerge. One version is trying to kill him. In a race against the clock, Darius sets out to find this other self before it finds him. Meanwhile, John Luka—an old ally of Darius and an eccentric, out-of-work juggler—learns that his friend may be in trouble. We learn that Luka was involved in a time travel experiment run amok, left scarred and destitute by the ordeal. Re-invigorated by the chance to help his friend, he sets out in search of Fyodor Wax, the father of the experiment, hoping Fyodor will lead him to his \\"brother Darius\\" before it’s too late. As Darius chips away at the case of his multiple selves, he is reunited with Alise, a beautiful woman from his past. A long-buried, yet troubled, romance is reignited. More memories surface—from a life they once had together, a life interrupted by an accident on a desert road ten years ago. When Luka finds Darius, the two men learn more about their shrouded past and the scientific experiment that links their existence, and it's suddenly clear what has to be done. Darius and Luka journey to a secret site called \\"Omphalos,\\" where they hope to put a stop to the disastrous experiment that may be at the root of their troubles. But the road to \\"Omphalos\\" isn't quite as it seems. The journey outward becomes a journey inward.

The club welcomes players at all skill levels who do and do not identify as LGBT, and has both Rugby Union and Touch Rugby teams. The club is a full and founding member of International Gay Rugby Association and Board (IGRAB), and in 2012 it hosted the Bingham Cup, the international gay and inclusive rugby championship.  History  The Village Spartans were founded in 1998 in Manchester, UK, becoming the second gay and inclusive team in the United Kingdom, after the Kings Cross Steelers in 1995. This was in response to the hostile environment encountered by players at the time trying to participate within non-inclusive teams, and sought to establish a gay and inclusive team to counter this. In August 1999, the Village Spartans and Kings Cross Steelers played the first match between two gay and inclusive rugby clubs in the United Kingdom. The Steelers won 22-15. This initial match evolved into the annual Pioneers Cup, which both the Spartans and Steelers host on a rotating basis. As both clubs have expanded multiple squads from both clubs compete in matches of similar skilled sides. In 2002 the club changed its club colours to the Rainbow Flag of the LGBT Community, colours which have been retained throughout various kit designs ever since. In 2012 the Spartans hosted the Bingham Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/31/gay-rugby- manchester-bingham-cup an international tournament for gay and inclusive teams from over a dozen countries, often termed the ‘gay rugby world cup’ for its scale. In 2017 the Spartans bid for the 2019 Union Cup, a Pan-European gay and inclusive rugby tournament, losing out to the Emerald Warriors RFC from Dublin, Ireland.https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/emerald-warriors-to- jet-off-to-bingham-cup-ahead-of-hosting-2019-union-cup-36963524.html 2017 marked the first time the Spartans sent three teams to an international competition, with the 3rd (3XV) team winning the bronze bowl. In 2017 the Spartans launched a full-time Touch Rugby programme, representing the first- time women were able to join the club as players. the Touch programme has 2 teams contesting in the Trafford Touch League. In 2019 the Spartans sent two teams to the pan-European gay and inclusive rugby tournament, the Union Cup. The 1st team made it to the final of the Union Cup division, losing to the Kings Cross Steelers 1st team, and placing as Union Cup runners up, and second in the tournament overall. The Spartans 2nd team made it to the final of the Challenger Cup division, winning the final and the Challenger Cup. In 2019 the Spartans celebrated their 20th anniversary, marking the team as one of the oldest gay and inclusive teams in the world, and the second oldest in the UK and Ireland. At present, the club has the following teams: * Manchester Village Spartans 1XV – North West Intermediate League Division 3 South * Manchester Village Spartans 2XV – IGR North * Manchester Village Spartans Touch Team The Spartans club house is the Sale Sports Club, based in Sale, Trafford.  Name and kit The Spartans take their name from the Spartans of Ancient Greece, whose warrior culture encouraged and celebrated male sexual and romantic love as a form of camaraderie and strength. Since 2002 the club colours have been the rainbow flag of the LGBT community, and have been retained in various kit redesigns over the years. The Spartans are unique as the only UK gay and inclusive team to prominently feature the rainbow flag on their kit. The logo shows a Spartan helmet with a rainbow plume, and the club has the moto Unione Fortior which means Strength in Union.

The herm depicts the Greek philosopher Socrates on one side, and the Roman Stoic Seneca the Younger on the other. It currently belongs to the Antikensammlung Berlin, found in the Altes Museum.Inventary number SK 391 (R 106)  Description  The two philosophers are joined together at the back of the head; their chests are in the shape of a herm. Both men have the usual cloak of a philosopher or orator above their left shoulder, although Socrates also wears an undershirt. The bearded Socrates is given a satyr-like form, as in literary descriptions and other portraits. Seneca, on the other hand, is depicted as clean-shaven with a receding hairline. His small, full-lipped mouth is pursed. It is speculated that the depiction of Seneca derives from a work created between AD 50 and 60—within the lifetime of the philosopher. In ancient art, double herms were a common statue type. While in Greece they were displayed in public rooms, in the Roman empire they were shown in private spaces. Thus the combination of the two philosophers here owed something to the personal inclinations of the person who commissioned it, even if it is not clear why these two philosophers were linked in particular. Probably it has to do with the fact that they were both forced to commit suicide. The presentation of philosophers (and poets) as double herms was the most common use of this genre. This parallel presentation is also seen in literature, for example in the Parallel Lives of Plutarch.  Identification  The double herm is important to scholarship since it is the only image that can certainly be said to depict Seneca. The attribution is proven by a Latin inscription on the left side of the bust (from the point of view of someone looking at Seneca), while Socrates is identified by a Greek inscription on the right hand side. The identification of Socrates can be considered certain based on comparison with many other depictions of Socrates, many of which are of much better quality. The portrait of Seneca on the other hand is used today to identify other portraits and statues of Seneca.

In the case of a stationary gas, the Jeans stability criterion can be used to compare the strength of gravity with that of thermal pressure. In the case of a differentially rotating disk, the shear force can provide an additional stabilizing force. The Toomre criterion for a disk to be stable can be expressed as, where c_s is the speed of sound (and measure of the thermal pressure), \\\\kappa is the epicyclic frequency, G is Newton's gravitational constant, and \\\\Sigma is the surface density of the disk. Toomre Q parameter is often defined as the left-hand side of Eq., The stability criterion can then simply be stated as, Q > 1 for a disk to be stable against collapse. The previous discussion was for a gaseous disk, but a similar analysis can be applied to a disk of stars (for example, the disk of a galaxy), yielding a kinematic Q parameter, where \\\\sigma_R is the radial velocity dispersion, and \\\\kappa is the local epicyclic frequency.  Background  Many astrophysical objects result from the gravitational collapse of gaseous objects (for example, star formation occurs when molecular clouds collapse under gravity), and thus the stability of gaseous systems is of great interest. In general, a physical system is 'stable' if: 1) It is in equilibrium (there is a balance of forces such that the system is static), and 2) small deviations from equilibrium will tend to damp out, so that the system tends to return to equilibrium. The most basic gravitational stability analysis is the Jeans criteria, which addresses the balance between self- gravity and thermal pressure in a gas. In terms of the two above stability conditions, the system is stable if: i) thermal pressure balances the force of gravity, and ii) if the system is compressed slightly, the outward pressure force must become stronger than the inward gravitational force - to return the system to equilibrium. In the Jeans case, the stability criterion is size dependent, resulting in the concept of a Jeans Length and Jeans Mass. The Toomre analysis, first studied by Viktor Safronov in the 1960s, considers not only gravity and pressure, but also shear forces from differential rotation. Conceptually, if a fluid is differentially rotating (such as in the keplerian motion of an astrophysical disk), gravity not only has to overcome the internal pressure of the gas, but also needs to halt the relative motion between two parcels of fluid, allowing them to collapse together. The analysis was expanded upon by Alar Toomre in 1964, and presented in a more general and comprehensive framework.

He was Ban of Slavonia between 1163 or 1164 and 1171 or 1174, and Palatine of Hungary from around 1164 till around 1176. Career He was mentioned as an \\"Ispán\\" (count) by a royal charter from 1162. Ampud was a loyal supporter of the young Stephen III of Hungary, whose right to the crown was challenged by his two uncles, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV, who had fled to the Byzantine Empire during their brother, Géza II's reign and gained support of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Following the victory over the usurper Stephen IV in June 1163, Manuel made peace with Stephen III who agreed to send his younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. However an 1164 charter of Peter, Archbishop of Spalato (now Split, Croatia) was dated in reference to the rule of Ban Ampud, suggesting that at least a part of Béla's duchyCentral Dalmatiawas under Stephen's rule in that year, thus Stephen soon broke the treaty with Manuel. Ampud was a skilled military leader. He took part in Stephen's campaign in Dalmatia. As Ban of Slavonia, he led a punitive expedition and captured Zadar in 1164. When Stephen III stormed into Sirmium and recaptured the whole province in spring 1166, a Hungarian army led by Ampud invaded Dalmatia and captured sebastos Nicephorus Chalouphes, the Byzantine governor of the province. He unsuccessfully besieged Spalato, but recaptured Biograd na Moru and Šibenik, as royal charters issued on behalf of the Hungarian monarch and Stephen III also confirmed estates in the two towns. According to a non-authentic royal charter, Ampud was Ispán of Csanád County in 1171. He retained his positions after the coronation of Béla III in 1172, proving Ampud had supported him in a struggle for the throne against Prince Géza. In 1176, he was one of the two commanders of the Hungarian auxiliary troops, alongside Voivode Leustach Rátót, sent by Béla III of Hungary to fight along the Byzantines against the Seljuks in the Battle of Myriokephalon. The battle was a heavy defeat for the Byzantine–Antiochian–Hungarian forces. Ampud died in 1186, according to the Annales Posonienses. Family Ampud's namesake son served as Ispán of Szolnok County in 1199, but there is no more information about him. His grandchild Denis made a more significant political career by introducing a new economic system as Master of the treasury (1216–1224) and by holding the position of Palatine of Hungary (1227–1228, 1231–1234) during the reign of Andrew II of Hungary.

The Somerville, Massachusetts-based company was founded in September 2011 by three MIT Media Lab students. The company develops and manufactures 3D printers and related software and consumables. It is most known for raising nearly $3 million in a Kickstarter campaign and creating the Form 1, Form 1+, Form 2, Form Cell, Form 3, Form 3L, and Fuse 1 stereolithography and selective laser sintering 3D printers. History Formlabs was founded by Maxim Lobovsky, Natan Linder, and David Cranor, who met as students at the MIT Media Lab while taking a class called \\"How to Make (almost) Anything\\". The founders also drew on their experience with MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms Fab Lab program, as well as Lobovsky's experience with the Fab@Home project at Cornell University. Formlabs was officially founded in September 2011 to develop the first desktop-sized, easy-to-use, and affordable stereolithography 3D printer. Formlabs received early seed funding from investors including Mitch Kapor, Joi Ito, and Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors. In November 2012, Formlabs was sued by the industrial 3D printing giant 3D Systems that claimed rights to the stereolithography technology that the Form 1 uses. In October 2013, Formlabs closed an additional $19 million Series A round of financing led by DFJ Growth, joined by Pitango Venture Capital, Innovation Endeavors, and returning angel investors. In 2015, Formlabs opened their second office in Berlin, Germany. In August 2015, Michael Sorkin, former co-founder of iGo3D, joined Formlabs to serve as the managing director of their European headquarters. In May 2016, Formlabs acquired online 3D printing community and marketplace Pinshape. In August 2016, Formlabs raised $35 million in series B funding led by Foundry Group. In March 2017, Formlabs announced that the Form 1+ was officially sold out and they would not continue to produce the Form +1, instead shifting all focus on shipping Form 2 printers. In April 2018, Formlabs raised $30 million in series C funding led by Tyche Partners, with investors including the municipally-owned Shenzhen Capital Group. The company said it would use the funding to expand its product portfolio and scale operations to meet increasing customer demand, particularly from Asia. Products =Form 1= In October 2012, Formlabs publicly announced its first product, the Form 1 3D printer, in a Kickstarter campaign that raised a record breaking $2.95 million in funding making the Form 1 one of the most highly funded crowdfunding projects up until that time. Form 1 3D printers began shipping to backers in May 2013 after months of delayed production. The Form 1 used a 3D printing process known as stereolithography, wherein liquid resin is cured, or hardened, into a solid material by the application of laser light. Although previously available in larger, more expensive machines, the Form 1 offered stereolithography in a smaller, more affordable desktop-class device. =Form 1+= Form 1+ On June 10, 2014, Formlabs released the Form 1+ 3D Printer, which replaced the Form 1 in their product line. Improvements included speed, print quality, and reliability. The Form 1+ was officially sunsetted March 15, 2017. = Form 2 = Form 2 On 22 September 2015, Formlabs announced the Form 2 printer, including a larger build volume and a wiper. It also switches to a cartridge resin system, instead of bottles that needed to be manually poured into the Form 1 & Form 1+. Third-party resins can be used with Open Mode. The Form 2 was named Best Resin Printer for 2019 by Tom's Guide in their annual rankings. = Form Wash and Form Cure = On 5 May 2017, Formlabs announced the Form Wash and the Form Cure. Together with the Form 2, they complete the SLA engine. The Form Wash is an washing machine used to automatically clean liquid resin off of printed 3D models. The Form Cure is an ultraviolet postcuring system. After printing, the build platform on the Form 2 can be removed and installed on the Form Wash, which uses an impeller to agitate 3D printed parts in isopropyl alcohol. The Form Cure heats parts up to 80 degrees Celsius and uses thirteen 405 nanometer UV LEDs. = Fuse 1 = On 5 June 2017, Formlabs announced the Fuse 1, a selective laser sintering 3D printer. It has a much larger build volume, a removable build chamber, and uses nylon powder. = Form 3, Form 3B and Form 3L = On 2 April 2019, Formlabs announced the 4th and 5th iteration of their SLA printers, the Form 3 and Form 3L, designed for use by artists, designers, and other professionals. The Form 3 offers a larger print area than the Form 2 as well as Low Force Stereolithography (LFS), a new SLA technology developed by Formlabs that promises smoother surface finish and more detailed prints. The Form 3L utilizes the same optics engine as the Form 3, including LFS, with five times the build volume. Additional improvements include an upgraded optics engine, modular components to simplify repair and integrated sensors to improve print success and usability. This earned it the title of Best Resin Printer of 2019 by The Mediahq. On 12 November 2019, Formlabs launched the Form 3B, a variant of the Form 3 specially designed for the dental industry. Unlike the Form 3, the Form 3B is compatible with Formlabs' array of specialty dental materials. = Form Cell = On 5 June 2017, Formlabs announced the Form Cell, a cell of Form 2 3D printers, as well as a Form Wash and a robotic gantry system. It is completely automated and can be used as a 24-hour digital \\"factory\\". =PreForm= Formlabs provides a free software package called PreForm, designed to prepare 3D models for printing on the Form 1, Form 1+, Form 2, Form 3, and Fuse 1. Some of the features of PreForm include automatic model orientation and support structure generation. =Nasopharyngeal Swabs= As the COVID-19 pandemic took off in March 2020, Formlabs, working with, Northwell Health and the University of South Florida developed a 3D printed nasopharyngeal swab made from biocompatible resins. After receiving FDA Class I Exempt status, Formlabs quickly went into production; its printing facility in Ohio was initially able to produce 150,000 swabs daily, and the design was released so that hospitals with their own printers can make swabs. Northwell and the University of South Florida were each immediately able produce 1,500 swabs daily with printers they already had.Formlabs Is 3D Printing More than 100,000 COVID-19 Test Swabs Daily, PlasticsToday, Mar 29, 2020.Sarah Worth, USF Health, Northwell Health, Tampa General Hospital and Formlabs Join Forces to Create 3D Printed Nasal Swabs to Test for COVID-19, USF Health News, March 28, 2020Linda Carroll, New York's Northwell Health begins 3D printing nasal swabs for coronavirus testing, Reuters, March 31, 2020 =Materials= Formlabs currently sells several resins for their stereolithography printers (Form 1, Form 1+, and Form 2). Their general-purpose hard plastic resin is available in four colors: clear, white, grey, black. In addition, the company sells multiple specialty resins: a resin specialized for casting, a flexible resin, a tough resin, a rigid resin, a high-definition structural resin and a Class 1 biocompatible resin for intraoral surgical guides. They also sell a Class IIa clear biocompatible resin for orthodontic devices. Formlabs sells the resin cartridges used for printing on the Form 2.

He served on the town council of and as mayor of Berlin, Maryland, served two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates, and founded a banking company bearing his name that continues to exist in eastern Maryland and Delaware. Early life and education The son of Arthur W. Taylor and Margaret Ellen Bowen Taylor, Calvin B. Taylor was born at Trappe Creek Farm near Berlin, Maryland, on December 28, 1857. Growing up on the farm, he attended public schools in addition to Old Buckingham Academy. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1882 and later a Master of Arts degree from Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College). Career Taylor became an educator after earning his degrees, teaching at Bishopville Academy before becoming principal. He subsequently returned to Buckingham Academy, his alma mater, to serve as its first principal after becoming Berlin High School. He would remain in that position for six years, studying law and being admitted to the bar in 1886 or 1887 during that time, until resigning in 1889 to practice law full-time. Shortly thereafter, in 1890, Taylor entered business as a banker in conjunction with his law partner, Edward D. Martin. Originally a private bank under the name of Calvin B. Taylor, Banker, Martin withdrew before its renaming to Calvin B. Taylor Banking Company and its 1907 incorporation as the Calvin B. Taylor Banking Company of Berlin. The corporation remains in existence in Worcester County, Maryland and Sussex County, Delaware, as Taylor Bank. Taylor also served as director of the First National Bank in Snow Hill, Maryland, as well as the Bishopville Bank. In addition to banking, Taylor also began an insurance company connected to the bank under the name of Calvin B. Taylor & Co. in conjunction with William L. Holloway, which also remains in existence as Smith, Cropper & Deeley Inc. Having established a name for himself in the local community, Taylor served for four years as a member of the Berlin Town Council. In 1898, he was elected to represent Worcester County in the Maryland House of Delegates, receiving 2,109 votes, the most of any of the nine candidates in the field—three of whom were elected. He served one term, until 1899, before returning in 1912 for another term through 1913. He subsequently served for two years, from 1914 to 1916, as Mayor of Berlin. In addition to holding political office, Taylor served on the Maryland Democratic State Central Committee for 25 years. Taylor continued to practice law and serve as president and chairman of the board of directors for the Calvin B. Taylor Banking Company until his death on May 31, 1932.

Lykourgos Logothetis (, 10 February 1772 – 25 May 1850 (O.S.)), born Georgios Paplomatas, was a Samian who became the island's leader during the Greek War of Independence. The son of a wealthy merchant, Logothetis received a good education at Constantinople and then served as an official in the Phanariote administration of Wallachia. His political career experienced great vicissitudes: he served as an elder in his home island, taking the side of the progressive-radical Karmanioloi (\\"Carmagnoles\\", named after the French Revolutionary song Carmagnole) and the reactionary Kallikantzaroi (\\"goblins\\") who represented mostly the traditional land-holding elites. Under Logothetis, the Karmanioloi ruled Samos from 1807 until the intervention of the Ottoman authorities in 1812, which restored the Kallikantzaroi to power and forced the Karmanioloi to flee the island. During this time of exile he became a member of the Filiki Etaireia, and assumed the conspirational name by which became better known. On the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence he returned to Samos and was quickly elected the island's political and military leader, founding the \\"Military-Political System of Samos\\", which he led until 1833, with the exception of the period 1828–30, when Samos was administered as part of the nascent Greek state. Logothetis was head of the Greek forces during the unsuccessful campaign to Chios in 1822, which led to the massacre and destruction of the island and was heavily criticized for his actions. In 1833, through the intervention of the Great Powers, the island returned to Ottoman suzerainty as an autonomous principality, and Logothetis was forced to leave for the independent Kingdom of Greece. There he became involved in politics, and became a senator. He died of heart failure on 25 May 1850.

Main characters ; : :Coming from the Neighbor World, he has a laid back attitude, and isn't very knowledgeable of Japanese customs, leading him into confusions with the wrong people. When he was 11, he and his father were on a war in the Neighbor world, lending their power to an old friend of his father. In an occasion where his father told him not to follow him, Yūma disobeyed his father, sneaking into battle, which caused his death. His father, finding his dying son, sacrificed his life to create a to revive Yūma. Yuma's dead body is sealed in a ring that also holds his black trigger and he received a body made from trion. His guardian, Replica, told him to go to the Human world and see if Border could find a cure to his condition (though he wanted to bring his father back instead), only to find out they didn't know the answer either. In chapter 33 he officially joined Border as a C-Rank attacker in Mikumo Unit. As he explained, he's what they actually call a \\"Neighbor\\", and the creatures that have been attacking the human world are actually \\"Trion Soldiers\\", drones created to perform different tasks. He received the nickname , and in the B-Rank Wars, his nickname becomes \\"White Nightmare\\", due to his white hair and ferocity in battle. Despite his young appearance, he is 15 years old. He is an Attacker that uses Scorpion to fight in the Rank Wars. He also possesses a Side Effect which enables him to accurately determine when a person is lying. ; : :A Border agent with low Trion level. He is usually referred as simply \\"Four Eyes\\" by people outside the Mikumo unit. He later promoted into B-Rank Border and later became a Shooter and the leader of Mikumo Unit, also known as . He became Chika's protector after her older brother (and his tutor) disappeared mysteriously, and joined Border in order to be better able to protect her, but the examiner suggested him to become an Engineer or Operator, due to his low trion. Unable to accept this, he imprudently tried to infiltrate Border's headquarters and negotiate with them, but he was almost attacked by a Bamster, which was destroyed by Jin. The S-rank member then talks Border into accepting Osamu as a C-Rank trainee. He befriended Yūma after he was transferred to his school. He is 15 years old. He is a Shooter. ; : :A girl with huge trion level, which \\"attracts\\" Trion Soldiers towards her. Her brother Rinji and friend were captured by the neighbor, and tired of running away and looking for a way to rescue them, she joins Border as a C-Rank Sniper in Mikumo Unit. She purposely keeps herself away from others because she is afraid she'll cause them to be captured by Neighbors and she doesn't want to get hurt. She also has a side effect that allows her to feel the presence of Trion Soldiers and hide her presence from them. Izumi labeled her as , due to her huge amount of trion. In the B-Rank Wars, the official nickname is \\"Super Trion Monster\\". She has short hair styled in a hime cut, with a cowlick in the middle. She is 13 years old. ; : :Yūichi is an A-Rank Solo Attacker (originally S-Rank) at Border with precognitive powers. He is a very friendly and carefree person. He is a self- proclaimed \\"Talented Elite\\", but his skills and strategies in battle are more than enough to back up his confidence. His mother was killed by Neighbors but despite that, he doesn't hate Neighbors, as he has been to the Neighbor World and knows not all Neighbors are evil. He was the one who invited Yūma to join Border. Like Yūma's father, his mentor sacrificed his own life to create a Black Trigger, which Yūichi competed for, and later gave it away so that Yūma could officially join and be recognized as a Border agent by Headquarters. His Side Effect allows him to see the near future, which is highly valued by Border. He is 19 years old. ; : :Yūma's guardian, created by his father to protect Yūma and teach him right from wrong. He has information on various countries that Yūma and his father visited. He was the one who told Yūma to come to the human world.

While in this state he, with the help of Osamu, infiltrates the black trigger ship and manages to send the ship back. While this ultimately saved Osuma and Chika, replica was unable to leave the ship. It is currently unknown if he managed to survive or if he is still \\"alive\\" or not.World Trigger Chapter 80 Border =Tamakoma Branch= is a faction of Border which believes Neighbors and Humans can be friends, and takes a more diplomatic approach to them. Tamakoma Branch's engineers created various Triggers which are a lot more powerful than those in the Headquarters. ; : :The branch chief of Tamakoma Branch, a carefree and friendly man. Due to his past experiences, he learned that not all Neighbors are enemies of the Human race, and thus wants to befriend all those among them who are good.

It was written by Ernesto Gastaldi based on a story by Gastaldi and producer Luciano Martino. Set in Geneva, the film follows a recently married American woman who finds herself in danger after a stranger begins to target her husband and accuse him of murdering his ex-wife. Plot Deborah (Carroll Baker) and Marcel (Jean Sorel) return to Geneva from their honeymoon. Marcel learns of his former fiancée Susan's suicide, and is confronted by a man named Philip (Luigi Pistilli) who accuses him of murdering her. Marcel begins to receive threats from someone who holds him responsible for Susan's death. His new bride Deborah also becomes the target of these threats, and a weird neighbor named Robert with voyeuristic tendencies (George Hilton) begins fixating on her as well.  Cast  * Carroll Baker as Deborah * Jean Sorel as Marcel * George Hilton as Robert (the voyeur) * Evelyn Stewart as Susan/Suzanne Boileau * Luigi Pistilli as Philip Release The Sweet Body of Deborah was released in Italy in 1968 as Il dolce corpo di Deborah. The film later opened in Paris in February 1969 as L'adorable corps de Deborah. In the United States, where the film was distributed by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, it opened in Detroit on March 12, 1969. The film was a box office hit in Italy, inspiring a number of similar thrillers starring Carroll Baker, but was not as successful in the United Kingdom and United States, and marked the beginning of actress Carroll Baker's career in Europe starring in giallo and horror films. Reception The New York Times gave the film a middling review, with critic Vincent Canby noting the film's \\"disembodied narrative—[it is] a movie without any real national identity that seems to have sprung into existence not because of any artistic urgency but because somebody could make a deal.\\" In Variety, \\"Murf.\\" noted \\"contrived direction and photography, lifeless dubbing and careless production mark this Italo-French co-production, which Warner Bros.-Severn Arts can ride to okay first playoff.\\" The Saturday Review gave the film a positive review, noting that: \\"the film's unstinting effort to entertain at all costs is both welcome and refreshing.\\" The film was considered very sexy for its time, showing brief glimpses of Carroll Baker's nudity and Ida Galli's fetishistic clothing. Upon the film's release, The New Yorker republished a snippet of a review by John Mahoney of The Hollywood Reporter, which contained an extensive and detailed description of Baker's nude body as it appeared in the film.

The event features many genres of music, as well as independent film screenings and art installations. Other activities offered at the festival have included boat cruises, a brew fest, \\"KahBlock Party,\\" and the closing \\"KahBrunch and Kickball Tournament.\\" At times the festival has offered lodging and camping packages, and the campsite often features additional musical entertainment throughout the event. In 2014, the music portion of the event was cancelled, and the art/film portion was moved to Portland, Maine. History =2009= The inaugural KahBang Festival, held in August 2009, brought more than 2,000 attendees to the Bangor, Maine Waterfront and featured bands such as Matt and Kim, Ra Ra Riot and Ida Maria. The festival was originally a two-day music event. =2010= In 2010 the festival expanded to include the Bangor Film Festival. Like its counterparts, the film festival focused on showcasing emerging filmmakers and independently produced works. The inaugural lineup of films included the Maynard James Keenan documentary Blood Into Wine and the indie feature comedy New Low. The expanded festival attracted over 30,000 attendees and featured live performances from BOB, OK Go, Biz Markie, Free Energy, and Bad Rabbits. =2011= In 2011, the festival offered camping for the first time. The festival campsite was located on the remains of an old driving range and was a short distance from the festival grounds. New additions to KahBang 2011 included the establishment of KahBang Arts, a nonprofit arm of festival operations, headed by a board of directors composed of community members. 2011 was also the first KahBang Connect Conference, a social media industry conference, showcasing experts from across the spectrum of social media and connectivity. Acts included: My Morning Jacket, Lupe Fiasco, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Atmosphere, Chromeo, and Surfer Blood =2012= In 2012, the festival hosted a summer art walk in conjunction with the festival, and local artists opened the doors to their studios and galleries for public viewing in conjunction with the festival. In 2012, KahBang adapted to its current format of 4 days, running Thursday through Sunday and added its Brew Fest event, highlighting local, micro-brewed beer. Acts included: Bassnectar, Deftones, Paper Diamond, Penguin Prison, Reptar, Lady Lamb the Beekeeper, Astronautalis, Now, Now, and Spose =2013= The first day of the 2013 festival was hampered by nonstop rain that at times heavily deterred the majority of festival-goers. Muddy fields made for difficult dancing, and the constant wet made it dangerous for amplifiers to be plugged in. Several bands had to postpone their performances until Saturday, while others played acoustic or performed in the Dance Tent. The Bangor Daily News hosted a \\"What’s Next Conference\\" as part of the festival, and brought multiple panelists and speakers from all over the country to lead technology and business discussions on topics such as social media, app development, marketing and branding. The festival also featured late night performances at bars around Bangor, and an early-morning dance party at the KahBang Campsite. Acts included: Earl Sweatshirt, Dr. Dog, 12th Planet, The Weeks, Oberhofer, RDGLDGRN, Vacationer, Spose, Lady Lamb the Beekeeper, Codes, Spencer Albee, and Mean Creek =2014= Three weeks before major performers DMX and St. Vincent were scheduled to take the stage, organizers announced a last-minute venue change that took the festival two hours south to Portland, Maine. The 2014 edition of the music, art and film festival was to be held mostly indoors at venues including the State Theatre and Port City Music Hall. The KahBang Festival had partnered with the city of Portland to bring concerts to the Maine State Pier in the summer of 2011. The decision was greatly influenced by the festival’s failure to find a campsite to house festival-goers, artists and bands in the Bangor area. On July 31, 2014, KahBang director Joshua Gass announced that the music portion of the festival had been cancelled and told fans that \\"several setbacks in planning, including the loss of sponsors, made it difficult to stage the acts.\\" The KahBang Brew Fest had already been cancelled two weeks previous to the announcement.

The factory began production in 1884 as a planned expansion and replacement of the North Eastern Railway's Queen Street site; the works was substantially expanded in 1897–1900, and saw further modernisations through the 20th century. The works passed to the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway (1923); British Railways (1948); British Rail Engineering Limited, known as BREL York (1970); and privatised and acquired by ABB in 1989 (ABB York). The works closed in 1996, due to lack of orders caused by uncertainty in the post-privatisation of British Rail period. Thrall Car Manufacturing Company used the works to manufacture freight wagons for English Welsh and Scottish Railway from 1998 to 2002, after which the factory closed again. As of 2009, the site is in maintenance related rail use by Network Rail as their Rail Fleet Engineering Centre (RFEC). The site is used by Network Rail, and various rail sub-contractors to maintain Network Rails own fleet of maintenance rail vehicles. As a consequence of manufacturing work using asbestos during the 20th century more than a hundred people associated from the works have died from illness caused by exposure to the material, with asbestos related illnesses still occurring and causing death into the 21st century. History =NER (1884–1923)= After the transfer of wagon building from York Queen Street in 1867, in 1880 the North Eastern Railway took the decision to move carriage building to a new site, and the first contracts let for its construction in 1880. The works was designed as an integrated carriage building factory, with separate buildings for each process. The main buildings were of brick construction, with stone and coloured brick detailing. The internal construction was of cast iron columns with wrought iron beams. Carriage building started in 1884. By the late 1890s capacity had been reached, exacerbated by the increase in length of carriages, and from 1897 contracts were let for the construction of expansion of the works, primarily west, plus a large lifting shop adjacent south of the main works building. Electric and gas shops were also added and additional stores, plus servicing and washing sheds to the west. The expansion of buildings was mostly complete by 1900, excluding a wagon (rulley) shop built 1904.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1892, 1909 A large wood drying store allowed a ready supply of seasoned woods for carriage manufacture. In 1903 two , Petrol Electric Autocars were built, numbers 3170 and 3171, early examples of electric transmission in rail vehicles; the works produced rolling stock for the North Tyneside electrification in the same period. During the First World War, the York works produced material for the war effort, mostly logistics equipment – existing carriage rolling stock was converted into an ambulance train and a complete train with was produced for the Director General of Transportation. In 1920 the carriage works had of buildings on a site of . The works built all of the coaching stock of the NER, plus much of the East Coast Joint Stock and Great Northern and North-Eastern Joint Stock, as well as undertaking most of the NER's carriage repairs. The site consisted of two main buildings on the east end of the site; the northernmost one was used for building and painting vehicles, the southern one included the sawmill, frame and cabinet building, machine and brake shops. There were also offices, a smithy and cat shop, and gas and electric shops. West of the main works was a large timber drying building, and carriage washing facilities. The 1871 building was still in use as, mainly as a glass store and paintshop. Overall the carriage works employed 1,500 persons. =LNER period (1923–1948)= The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) added traversers () at the west and east end of the main works building on the south side; to accommodate the east traverser the buildings were shortened.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1931, 1937 During the Second World War the carriages works produced parts for Horsa Gliders. In 1944 part of the north building (building shop) which had been manufacturing launches for the Royal Navy was destroyed by an accidental fire. The building was rebuilt with a new roof with clerestory lighting. During the war period time many of the workers were women, who worked shifts up to 69 hours in a week. =BR period (1948–1989)= At nationalisation (see Transport Act 1947) the works employed around 5,000 people. During the 1950s there were over 3,000 staff employed by the works and early Diesel Multiple Units were maintained on the site. Some early Electric Multiple Unit trains were built at York, such as British Rail Class 305/1.Railway Magazine January 1961 p. 11 In the 1960s the BR workshops were re-organised : regional workshops were abolished and control centralised with excess works closing. York, together with Derby was retained and assigned to carriage production, and £976,000 authorised for investment at the site. In 1970 the rolling stock workshops division of British Rail (excluding repair works) became British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL). From the 1970s to 1989 the works manufactured much of British Rail's electric multiple unit passenger stock, including: Class 313 (64 three car trains, 1976/7); Class 314 (16 three car trains, 1979); Class 315 (61 four car, 1980/1); Class 317 (72 four car, 1981-2 & 1985-7); Class 319 (86 four car, 1987–1990); Class 318 (21 three car, 1984–1986);, Class 321 (117 four car, 1988–1991). and Class 455 (137 four car, 1982-4). The works continued producing vehicles for British Rail after privatisation. Also Class 150 DMU was made. BREL introduced some modern manufacturing methods at the works, installations included: five sheet metal machining centres, one with an automatic tool change, used to manufacture body shells and bolster parts for EMUs; test facilities for air-conditioning units; and clean rooms for electronics repair. The works also had a short test track electrified at 750 V DC or 25 kV AC. Experiments were carried out into robotic welding machines in the early 1980s, but the technique was not used for production at that time. =Post-privatisation (1989–)= BREL was privatised in 1987, as BREL (1988) Ltd., and acquired by a consortium including management, Trafalgar House and ABB acquired the company including the York works in 1989. Procurement contracts on British Rail began being put to public tender in the 1980s; the fate of the works was linked primarily to the number of orders for Network SouthEast for electric passenger stock – failure to win the contract for electric multiple units for the Heathrow Express service (awarded to Siemens/CAF, see Class 332) resulted in the loss of 289 jobs. The works obtained contracts to build: Class 320 (22 three car, 1990); Class 322 (5 four car, 1990); Class 365 (41 four car, 1994/5); Class 456 (24 two car. 1991–92) and Class 465 (97 four car, 1991–1994). Additionally Eurotrams were built for the Strasbourg tramways at the site, and at ABB's Derby Litchurch Lane works . In 1995 ABB announced that the factory would close due to lack of orders; the cause was widely recognised as being due to a gap in train orders caused by uncertainties following the privatisation of British Rail: Union officials, ABB management, and Conservative and Labour members of parliament all expressed similar views on the cause of the closure. The carriage works closed in 1996 with 750 redundancies; ABB blamed the closure on the privatisation of British Rail, stating that the privatisation had delayed orders, causing a gap in the company's order books. It also made Class 165 and Class 166 diesel trains. Wagon manufacturer Thrall (USA) reopened the plant as wagon works in 1997, having obtained about a £200 million order from EWS for 2,500 wagons. First production was the BYA type covered steel coil carriers. The first wagon was formally presented in July 1998. Nearly half of the order was for 1145 HTA coal hoppers. Other wagon types produced included 300 MBA 'monster box', 260 BYA (covered steel coil), 100+400+300 FAA; FCA and FKA container flat wagons, and 60 BRA steel wagons. Prototype MRA ballast wagons were also manufactured for Railtrack at the site . No further orders were received, and in 2002 the factory was closed by Thrall successor Trinity Industries with 260 redundancies. Network Rail acquired the main building in 2009 for storage and maintenance of Rail Head Treatment Train wagons. Legacy =Asbestos contamination= Asbestos was used in rolling stock manufacture as thermal, and sound insulation; in carriages asbestos would be applied between inner and outer bodywork layers as well as in flooring and radiator insulation. After the beginning of the British Rail Modernisation Plan in the 1950s blue asbestos came into increasing use, until its health dangers were recognised. In 1975 an inquest into the death of former railway work Frank Summers recorded that he had died from an industrial disease; he had previous been employed in asbestos spraying at York Carriage works. At the inquest it was claimed that the use of asbestos at the works ended in 1964; initially the dangers of asbestos were not known and employees worked without facemasks or other protection; workers continued to be exposed to asbestos into the 1970s, relatives of workers also developed asbestos related diseases through contact with dust on workers clothing. The Holgate Road site was still contaminated with asbestos in some areas in the 1990s. By 2012 it was estimated that over 140 workers had died as a result of exposure to asbestos. =Buildings= Most of the buildings auxiliary to the main works have been demolished post closure. West of the main works the area was cleared and partially developed for housing, and the gas and electric shops were demolished; the stores building in the northeast corner was reused as a small business premises.Ordnance Survey 1:10000 1992 1:25000 2006 References =Sources=  =Further reading=  External links Category:North Eastern Railway (UK) Category:Railway workshops in Great Britain Category:History of York Category:Rail transport in York ","title":"Holgate Road carriage works, York"},{"id":"43352267","text":"Ctenomys andersoni, also called Anderson's cujuchi, is a species of tuco-tuco native to Bolivia.
