You like tanning. √Öke Cato and Lars Richter brilliant with a script not in the height of, but close to S√§llskapsresans. G√∂sta Ekman's and Janne Carlsson's interplay is a schoolbook example in timing and in Ekman's case mimic, that with small little gestures create brilliant physical comedy. It wasn't more fun than this in the eighties. Thanks for everything G√∂sta and Janne. Thrill Me Softly: G√∂sta Ekman and Loffe Carlsson are perfect for their roles as the timid, clumsy architect and the happy, frantic mechanic who becomes grass clippings and happens to be brought together by an event. It is not entirely unexpected who in the duo makes it for who. Pretty fun to see G√∂sta being forced to play on disco, socializing with Loffe's children, and so on ‚Äì he stumbles and is bothered in the usual order.

Her play Girls, about three girls abducted by terrorists in northern Nigeria, won the National Theatre's Alfred Fagon Award and other awards.  Early life and education  Ikoko grew up with her mother and eight siblings in the Hackney neighborhood of London. Ikoko has said that the label \\"poor\\" was put upon her and that communities that are poorer are misrepresented by the media as \\"problem areas\\" which ignores the potential of these areas and the fact that the negativity coming from these communities is a societal issue. She says that \\"poverty isn‚Äôt all about suffering and darkness,\\" and describes her upbringing as \\"rich in joy.\\" Growing up, Ikoko was inspired by authors Malorie Blackman, Sister Souljah, and Eric Jerome Dickey. Ikoko earned an undergraduate degree in psychology from Royal Holloway, University of London and a master's degree in Criminology and Criminal Psychology from the University of Oxford. While at Royal Holloway she contributed to a journal article on \\"how the conversation dynamics of women from ethnic majority and minority groups varied in different conversational contexts.\\" Ikoko has worked on social inclusion and community engagement projects within prisons, including facilitating creative and performing arts workshops with incarcerated persons. She worked with Islington Integrated Gangs, a London organization that focuses on gang violence in youth communities, from 2014 until 2019, when she began writing full-time.  Playwriting  Ikoko's first full-length play was Normal, which was produced as a staged reading as part of the Talawa Firsts' series in 2014. Ikoko came to greater attention and acclaim for her second full-length play, Girls, which won the Alfred Fagon Award for best new play in 2015; the award honors excellence in playwrights by authors of African or Caribbean ancestry living in the United Kingdom. Girls went on to be produced by Talawa Theatre Company, HighTide Theatre and Soho Theatre in 2016, before being revived for a tour in 2017 which also took in shows at the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe. At the time Ikoko said: \\"This isn‚Äôt the first play I‚Äôve written, but it‚Äôs my first produced play. The first play I wrote, I didn‚Äôt really know it was a play, it was just for me. I would read it over the phone to my friend and when I‚Äôd finished he said I had to show it to someone. Talawa Theatre Company found me and [artistic director] Michael Buffong put that play in a Talawa Firsts show, and I got signed by my agent there. A few months later, I was commissioned to work with Clean Break and Talawa. I make no exaggerations when I say Talawa completely took a chance on me. I had no training or experience or credentials, and there was no one to offer a reference. But Michael believed in me. It took me forever though, probably until the opening night of Girls at HighTide, for me to believe him.\\". Ikoko was one of five winners of the Channel 4 Playwrights Scheme for her play Girls, which earned Ikoko a year-long playwriting fellowship the HighTide Theatre. Ikoko also received the George Devine Award for most promising playwright in 2016. Girls was produced at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the HighTide Festival, and at the Soho Theatre in 2016. It was Ikoko's first professionally produced play. The play addresses issues of kidnapping, forced religion, sexism, and arranged marriage as well as themes of friendship and resilience. A review in The Times called the play \\"pungent\\", \\"provocative\\", \\"scorchingly intelligent and as powerful as a gut punch.\\" Ikoko cites as inspirations playwrights debbie tucker green and Dennis Kelly, author Chinua Achebe, and recording artist and activist Sister Souljah. Speaking about her motivation for writing, she has said \\"As a writer, I want to write things that change the lives of 14 year old girls in school, of university students and of grown men behind prison doors.\\" = Plays = *The Race Card, 2013 *Normal, 2014 *Visiting Hours, 2014 *Girls, 2015  Screenwriting  With Claire Wilson, she cowrote the screenplay for Sarah Gavron's 2019 film Rocks.Wendy Ide, \\"'Rocks': Toronto Review\\".

It was discovered on 17 April 2012, by a team of astronomers using one of the Magellan Telescopes in Chile during the New Horizons KBO Search in order to find a potential flyby target for the New Horizons spacecraft. In December 2017, this classical Kuiper belt object was imaged by the spacecraft from afar at a record distance from Earth.  Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at a distance of 37.2‚Äì55.4 AU once every 315 years and 5 months (semi-major axis of 46.33 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 5.4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As a cubewano, also known as classical Kuiper belt object, is located in between the resonant plutino and twotino populations and has a low-eccentricity orbit. It belongs to the \\"stirred\\" hot population, but only just, since the rather arbitrary threshold to the cold population is typically defined for inclinations lower than 5¬∞. In the object classification of the Deep Ecliptic Survey, however, has a secured SCATNEAR type, which is a combination of the SCAT and NEAR attributes. It means that the object does not cross the orbit of Neptune but has a higher inclination and eccentricity (SCAT) than the survey's CLASSICAL type objects, and it currently interacts with the dominant ice giant Neptune (NEAR), contrary to the much less gravitationally affected objects of the EXTD type. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation on 17 April 2012, made by astronomers David Osip, Paul Schechter, David Borncamp, Susan Benecchi and Scott Sheppard of the New Horizons KBO Search team using the Magellan II (Clay) telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory, located in the Atacama desert in Chile.  Milestone image  When the New Horizons spacecraft imaged in 2017, it was the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft. The image was taken by the spacecraft's Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) on 5 December 2017 at more than 6.12 billion kilometers (40.9 AU) away from Earth. This record was previously held by the Voyager 1 spacecraft which took the iconic Pale Blue Dot image at 6.06 billion kilometers from Earth in February 1990. In December 2017, New Horizons also imaged the trans-Neptunian object , which was first observed by the same team of astronomers the night after they discovered . Both objects held this record for little more than one year, until it was superseded on New Year's Eve 2018/19, when New Horizons made its close flyby of 486958 Arrokoth at a new record distance of 6.4 billion kilometers from Earth.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 30 April 2018 and received the number in the minor planet catalog (). As of 2020, it has not been named.  Physical characteristics  According to Johnston's Archive, the object measures 74 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.09 and an absolute magnitude of 8.9. As of 2019, no rotational lightcurve of has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

Abigail was theatrically released in Russia on August 22, 2019 by 20th Century Fox CIS. Plot Abigail is a young girl living in a town which, many years earlier, experienced an epidemic of a mysterious illness and was subsequently sealed off from the outside world by the government. One of those who fell ill was Abby‚Äôs father, taken away when she was six years old. While searching for her father, Abby finds out that the epidemic never actually occurred; it was all a huge deceit. In fact, she lives in a world of magic. Her city has been seized by users of dark magic, who wiped out all other sorcerers, banned magic, and attempted to erase all traces of its existence. The epidemic was a cover employed to \\"cleanse\\" the city of Magi. For many years, the Special Department has continued to snatch anyone who appear to have magical powers, deeming them \\"infected.\\" Most of the inhabitants have no idea that the city‚Äôs rulers are not their protectors, but their prison wardens. One day, Abby discovers that magical powers are stirring inside her. This scares her, but however hard she tries to suppress it the magic grows within her, and agents from the Special Department begin to hunt her down. She must flee from her home and begin a journey full of adventure and danger. This journey completely transforms her perceptions about magic and the world in which she lives.

It was first observed by a team of astronomers using one of the Magellan Telescopes in Chile during the New Horizons KBO Search on 18 April 2012, in order to find a potential flyby target for the New Horizons spacecraft. The likely 5:9 resonant object was imaged by the spacecraft from afar at a record distance from Earth in 2017.  Orbit and classification  The Kuiper belt object is considered to be a resonant trans-Neptunian object in a higher 5:9 orbital resonance with the ice giant Neptune. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 40.2‚Äì49.6 AU once every 300 years and 10 months (semi-major axis of 44.9 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official first observation by David Osip, Paul Schechter, David Borncamp, Susan Benecchi and Scott Sheppard of the New Horizons KBO Search using the Magellan II (Clay) telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory, located in the Atacama desert in Chile.  Milestone image  When the New Horizons spacecraft imaged in 2017, it was the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft. The image was taken by the spacecraft's Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) on 5 December 2017 at more than 6.12 billion kilometers (40.9 AU) away from Earth. This record was previously held by the Voyager 1 spacecraft which took the iconic Pale Blue Dot image at 6.06 billion kilometers from Earth in February 1990. In December 2017, New Horizons also imaged the classical Kuiper belt object , which was discovered by the same team of astronomers the night before they first observed . Both objects held this record for little more than one year, until it was superseded on New Year's Eve 2018/19, when New Horizons made its close flyby on 486958 Arrokoth at a new record distance of 6.4 billion kilometers from Earth.  Physical characteristics  According to Johnston's Archive, the object measures 74 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.09 and an absolute magnitude of 8.9. Another estimates gives a smaller diameter of 31 kilometers due to an assumed albedo of 0.15. As of 2019, no rotational lightcurve of has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.  Numbering and naming  As of 2019, this minor planet has neither been numbered nor named by the Minor Planet Center.

Wyall was part of the last class of Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) and later became the unofficial WASP historian. She was instrumental in organizing the WASP veterans together years after they served.  Biography  Wyall was born in Liberty, Indiana on January 24, 1922. She graduated from Shields High School in 1939, then went on to MacMurray's Women's College on a music scholarship. She transferred to DePauw University in her sophomore year where she majored in Liberal Arts. Wyall wanted to join the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) and took flying lessons after she graduated. She paid for her lessons by working at Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical as a lab assistant. She joined WASP in May 1944 and was part of the last WASP class of trainees. She was briefly stationed at Goodfellow Field before WASP was deactivated. She returned to Indiana in December 1944. After WASP was disbanded, Wyall worked as a pilot for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. She later worked at the Sky Harbor Airport as a ferry pilot and a flight instructor at Franklin Flying Field. In 1946, she married and raised five children with her husband, Eugene Andrew Wyall in Fort Wayne. At a 1964 convention of the Ninety-Nines, Wyall invited the WASPs to meet up, collecting 86 women who all decided to keep meeting every other year. Wyall became the unofficial record-keeper for the archives of those who were WASP. and She collected scrapbooks and obituaries, keeping the records in a converted bunkhouse on her farm. In 1978, she was voted by the other WASP veterans to be the \\"permanent historian\\" for the group. Later, she donated her archive to the Special Collections department of Texas Women's University.

Previously a village of some importance stood here, but by the 21st century was largely depopulated. It was recorded as a stand-alone district in zone no. 81 with Al Mukaynis in the 2004 census, but both districts lost their census designations to Mebaireek. In 2014, Abu Nakhla was moved from Al Rayyan Municipality to the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality. The district is host to Qatar's only water park. A hospital managed by the Hamad Medical Corporation is based here to meet the health needs for workers of the nearby Doha Industrial Area. Etymology \\"Abu\\" is the Arabic word for father, and serves to denote a geographical feature. The second word, \\"nakhla\\", is the local term for a palm tree, and was chosen in reference to a lone palm tree found in the area. Geography Reeds (Phragmites australis) in Abu Nakhla Pond Situated about away from the capital Doha, the district straddles the border of Al Rayyan Municipality and Al-Shahaniya Municipality. =Abu Nakhla Pond= Since 1985, sewage effluent from Doha has been dumped in a depression (rawda) in Abu Nakhla. Combined with gradual and continuous rainfall during the rainy season, the depression has morphed into a 2 to 3 km pond. Locals have long complained about negative environmental and health effects resulting from the pond, including increased pest populations, foul odors and seepage into aquifers. There is also a strong perception that the sewage water is untreated, and could pose a health hazard. From 2014 to 2015, a study was carried out on the area to investigate potential environmental hazards posed by the pond. The study revealed that, in regards to lithology, the rocks of the pond comprised two members of the Eocene-period Dammam Formation: the Simsima/Umm Bab Member and the Midra Shale Member. The former member is known for its shallow aquifer, as well as for its weak structure and frequent crevices and fissures, which make it susceptible to contamination by sewage leakage from the pond. Of the water quality, the pond was found to contain low amounts of bacterial contaminants due to Qatar's use of sophisticated filtration techniques. Concentrations of heavy metals were also found to be within acceptable ranges. Various species of wildlife currently reside in and around the pond, including frogs, fish, and at least 260 bird species. Approximately 150 greater flamingos have been recorded in the area. Plant life is also abundant here; approximately 10% of Qatar's documented plant species are represented here. Attractions Dilapidated mosque near the water reservoirs in Abu Nakhla. Qatar's first water park was opened in Abu Nakhla in October 2010. Cypriot company Aqua Masters was responsible for the park's planning and development while Kuwaiti Al Jazeera Entertainment Enterprises Company oversees its operation. Spread out over a 50,000 m¬≤ area, the park can accommodate up to 3,000 visitors at a time. A 300,000 m¬≤ tourist resort is under development next to the park. Agriculture As part of the Ministry of Municipality and Environment's Al Azab program to help improve the healthcare for livestock, it was announced in 2019 that a modern veterinary clinic is planned for the district. Water reservoir Abu Nakhla is one of five sites for the government-sponsored project to develop reservoirs in the country. Once completed, the reservoirs are expected to be the largest in the world in their category, with a total length of 650 km and constructed at a cost of QR 14.5 billion. In June 2018, the first phase of the project was completed. References Category:Populated places in Al-Shahaniya ","title":"Abu Nakhla"},{"id":"59569957","text":"Furnari is a surname.

Bartolini's research in political science includes research on electoral changes in Europe during the 1980s, which found that gains and losses at the party level did not translate into large changes at the bloc level. In terms of aggregate scores, the gains of parties within a bloc, whether left-wing or right-wing, were offset by the losses of other parties within the same bloc. According to Bartolini, the integration of Europe reverses the centuries-long process of national boundary construction. This provides \\"exit options\\" for individuals who had previously been bounded to their nation of birth.Hooghe, Liesbet, and Gary Marks. \\"A postfunctionalist theory of European integration: From permissive consensus to constraining dissensus.\\" British Journal of Political Science 39, no. 1 (2009): 1-23.

History A church of this name is documented since 1146. The structure changed over the centuries, and in 1406, it was ceded to the Servite order, who gained the privilege of baptism, and by the 1450s had built the cloister adjacent to the church. In the 17th century a new church was completed with a dome of the main chapel completed 1608‚Äì1612. In 1734‚Äì1736, Alfonso Torreggiani performed an extensive refurbishment, adding the external portico that obscures half of the facade. Later in the 18th century, the architect Giuseppe Tubertini expanded the interior. The interior houses statues of St Sebastian and Lawrence, attributed to Filippo Scandellari. At the presbytery, the nave's barrel ceiling is supported by large free-standing Corinthian columns, designed by Giovanni Battista Canepa. Four chapels open to each flank. Among the altarpieces in the chapels are paintings by Gaetano Gandolfi (Martyrdom of St Lawrence); Giovanni Andrea Donducci (Christ consigns keys to St Peter); Pietro Fancelli; and other artists of the Bolognese Baroque school.

He rose to the rank of mƒ´rlivƒÅ (major general) in the Egyptian Army and served as the Governor-General of the Sudan from 1862 until his death. He was a man of forceful character and some wealth, owning lands in Fayy≈´m.Richard Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan (London: Frank Cass, 1967), pp. 283‚Äì84. A Circassian by origin, M≈´sƒÅ entered the Egyptian Army at a time when Egypt was an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire. He was a low-ranking officer when he took part in the fighting around Gallabat during the Egyptian invasion of Ethiopia in 1837. He was first adjutant to the Governor-General A·∏•mad Pasha Manliklƒ´ during the war against the Beja in 1844. He earned a reputation for cruelty during this campaign. He then led an expedition against NƒÅ·π£ir ibn Abbukr, the makk of Taqali, in the Nuba Hills before he was appointed governor of Kordofan. In 1851 M≈´sƒÅ was appointed deputy governor-general of the Sudan and led a military expedition against the ·∏§alanqa and the Shukrƒ´ya people of the Bu·π≠ƒÅna. Afterwards, he returned to Egypt and was appointed governor of Girga, in which capacity he accompanied the wƒÅli Mu·∏•ammad Sa øƒ´d Pasha on his visit to Sudan in 1856‚Äì57. In 1857 Sa øƒ´d abolished the governorate-general as part of a policy of decentralization, but in 1862 he reversed policy and appointed M≈´sƒÅ to the re-established post. Before he was confirmed in office, M≈´sƒÅ had Mu·∏•ammad RƒÅsikh Bey removed from his governorship and the province divided into two, based on Khartoum and Sennar. One of his first acts as governor-general was to lead a reconnaissance-in-force to the border with Ethiopia, which was plagued by incessant cross-border slave raiding. He wintered at Dunkur in 1862‚Äì63 while he dispatched forces to raid Wehni and Welkait and to burn Mai Qubba on the Tekez√©, where some Ja ølƒ´yƒ´n refugees under the son of Makk Nimr were staying. M≈´sƒÅ introduced the carriage to Khartoum. He rode behind runners in the fashion of the ruler of Egypt. He was one of the few Sudanese governors to attain the honorary rank of Rumeli beylerbeysi. He died in Khartoum of smallpox and was buried in a qubba (domed tomb) on  øAbbƒÅs Avenue.Andrew McGregor (2001), \\"The Circassian Qubba-s of Abbas Avenue, Khartoum: Governors and Soldiers in 19th Century Sudan\\", Nordic Journal of African Studies 10(1): 28‚Äì40. Assessments of his character are generally negative. His methods of tax collection made him unpopular locally, and his successor as governor-general, Ja øfar Pasha ·π¢ƒÅdiq, considered him corrupt and a drunkard. The French explorer Guillaume Lejean lambasted him as a hangman and slaver, especially towards the BaqqƒÅra, and the British consul in Khartoum, John Petherick, agreed that he was excessively cruel. The German explorer Theodor von Heuglin, however, praised his friendly disposition towards Europeans.

The film stars Sivakumar, Sujatha, Suresh and Revathi in the lead roles. It was released on 17 October 1984 and became a success. Plot College student Indhu (Revathi) is the playful only child of Janaki (Sujatha). Indhu falls in love with fellow college student Murali (Suresh). Murali's father, Sabapathy (V. K. Ramasamy), and Janaki agree to their marriage but under the condition that both must graduate first. Indhu is worried about her Tamil exams as that's her weak subject. Sabapathy arranges for Indhu's professor, Raghuraman (Sivakumar) to tutor her. Raghuraman is shocked to see that Janaki is Indhu's mother and even more shocked when Indu mentions her deceased father as Captain Jagdeesh (Sarath Babu). In the past, Janaki and Raghuraman were married. Janaki sang at stage shows with her friend Vijay (Mohan) and Raghuraman suspected the two of having an affair. Unable to stand her husband's suspicions, Janaki left him and found sanctuary with Captain Jagdeesh who was a widower with a young daughter, Indhu. When the captain died, Janaki raised Indhu and allowed her to believe that Janaki was her biological mother. In the years of separation with Janaki, Raghuraman has realized the error of his ways and is sympathetic to her current situation. He agrees to keep their marriage a secret and the two grow closer again. Murali sees the two in an intimate situation and informs Indhu of this.

Spiegel's diary, kept between the ages of 15 and 18, documents her experience as a teenager living in the city of Przemy≈õl through World War II as conditions for Jews deteriorated. Spiegel wrote about ordinary topics such as school, friendships, and romance, as well as about her fear of the growing war and about being forced to move into the Przemy≈õl ghetto. As a diary about the Holocaust, it is unique in that it chronicles experiences under both Soviet and Nazi rule. Though it was in the possession of Spiegel's family for decades, the diary was not read by others until 2012, and was first published in English in 2019.  Life  Renia Spiegel was born on 18 June 1924 in Uhry≈Ñkowce, then in Poland and now in western Ukraine, to Polish-Jewish parents Bernard Spiegel and R√≥≈ºa Maria Leszczy≈Ñska. She grew up on her father's large estate on the Dniester River near the border between Poland and Romania, along with a sister six years younger than her, Ariana (now Elizabeth Bellak), who was a child film star in Poland. In 1938, Spiegel's mother sent her to live with her grandparents in the town of Przemy≈õl, Poland, while she herself moved to Warsaw to promote Ariana's acting career. Ariana was sent to join Spiegel in Przemy≈õl during the summer of 1938. Spiegel's grandmother owned a stationery store and her grandfather was a construction contractor. In August 1939, the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi invasion of Poland made it impossible for the two girls and their mother to reach each other. Spiegel's father, Bernard, had stayed on the family estate and subsequently disappeared during the ensuing war. Separated from their parents, Ariana later said that Spiegel \\"was like a mother to me.\\" As the war continued on, Spiegel attended school and socialized in Przemy≈õl, and in 1940 began to develop a romantic relationship with Zygmunt Schwarzer, the son of a prominent Jewish physician who was two years older than she. Spiegel referred to Schwarzer with the nickname \\"Zygu\\". When the Przemy≈õl ghetto was established July 1942, Spiegel moved in along with 24,000 other Jews. After about two weeks, Schwarzer, who worked with the local resistance, secretly removed Spiegel from the ghetto and hid her and his own parents in the attic of his uncle's house because they had not received the work permits they would need in order to avoid deportation to concentration camps. An unknown informant told Nazi police about the hiding place, who executed the eighteen-year-old Spiegel along with Schwarzer's parents in the street on July 30, 1942. Spiegel's mother, sister, and Schwarzer all survived the war and emigrated to the United States.  Diary and publication  = History of the diary = Spiegel began to keep her diary on January 31, 1939 when she was fifteen years old. The nearly 700-page diary was mostly kept in secret, and was made of seven school exercise books sewn together. The diary largely discusses Spiegel's everyday school, social, and family life in Przemy≈õl, touching in particular on her distress at being separated from her mother, her romantic relationship with Zygmunt Schwarzer, fear around the growing war, and the terror of moving into the ghetto. In addition to handwritten entries, the diary contains drawings and original poems. In her final entry on July 25, 1942, Spiegel wrote: > My dear diary, my good, beloved friend! We‚Äôve gone through such terrible > times together and now the worst moment is upon us. I could be afraid now. > But the One who didn‚Äôt leave us then will help us today too. He‚Äôll save us. > Hear, O, Israel, save us, help us. You‚Äôve kept me safe from bullets and > bombs, from grenades. Help me survive! And you, my dear mamma, pray for us > today, pray hard. Think about us and may your thoughts be blessed. At the end of July, Schwarzer took possession of the diary and wrote the final entries about hiding Spiegel outside the ghetto and about her death: \\"Three shots! Three lives lost! All I can hear are shots, shots.\\" Schwarzer left the diary with someone else before he was subsequently sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. After surviving the camp, Schwarzer brought the diary to the United States, and gave it to Spiegel's mother in 1950. Spiegel's sister Elizabeth (n√©e Ariana) Bellak came into possession of the diary in 1969, and stored it in a bank vault until 2012. = Publication = Though it was in the possession of Spiegel's family for decades, the diary was not read by others until 2012, when Bellak's daughter, Alexandra Renata Bellak, a Manhattan realtor, had it translated to English for the first time by Anna Blasiak and Marta Dziurosz. The diary was published in Polish in 2016 and has since inspired a Polish stage play. Excerpts were first published in English in Smithsonian magazine in 2018. The first full 90,000-word English publication is titled Renia‚Äôs Diary: A Young Girl‚Äôs Life in the Shadow of the Holocaust, published in the United Kingdom on September 19, 2019 by Ebury Publishing, and distributed by Penguin Books. In the United States, it is titled Renia's Diary: A Holocaust Journal, and was published by St. Martin's Press and distributed by Macmillan Publishers on September 24, 2019. The publication contains a prologue and epilogue by Elizabeth Bellak. This edition was published in Spanish by Plaza & Jan√©s on December 17, 2019. The diary is also the subject of a documentary film directed by Tomasz Magierski titled Broken Dreams. The film premiered at the United Nations in New York City as part of its Holocaust remembrance program. The film opened at a Polish cinema on September 18, 2019. = Reception = Journalists have compared and contrasted Spiegel's diary with that of Anne Frank, with Robin Shulman of Smithsonian noting that \\"Renia was a little older and more sophisticated ... She was also living out in the world instead of in seclusion.\\" Also writing for Smithsonian, Brigit Katz said that both Frank and Spiegel were \\"lucid writers, articulate and insightful in spite of their young age.\\" The Columbia University professor Anna Frajlich-Zajac called the diary \\"an incredible historical and psychological document, as well as an authentic literary achievement.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Joanna Berendt said, \\"At a moment when basic agreement over simple truths has become a political battleground and history a weapon, the publication of the book, 'Renia‚Äôs Diary,' offers a reminder of the power of bearing witness.\\" See also * List of Poles *List of victims of Nazism References  Further reading  * Spiegel, Renia.

In terms of the complex history of HIV/AIDS in human beings, widespread criticism by regular individuals against public health organizations (including, often, government-managed medical bureaucracies) have escalated into protest movements due to slow treatment responses (and, sometimes, outright discrimination against patients plus the proliferation of misconceptions about HIV/AIDS). Methods of demonstration have included the hanging of political leaders in effigy, pamphleteer activities, placard waving, public marches, sit-ins, and the like. Methods and organizational structures Silence=Death\\" slogan during a 2017 event in New York City. HIV/AIDS activism has often drawn its numbers from socially active patients who struggle with their health themselves as well as the friends and family of those diagnosed. Historically, these networks have swollen in size and thus influence by taking in sympathetic outsides existing within the same broader social community. For example, the South African fight against HIV/AIDS began largely among patients only to grow to a concern among most of the nation's gay men and then to a broader coalition of South Africans fighting for anti-disease treatment as a part of a socio-economic right to healthcare. Methods of protest have included the hanging of political leaders in effigy, pamphleteer activities, Placard waving, public marches, sit-ins, and many other such activities. Sometimes, sit-ins will escalate to demonstrations known as die-ins, during which protests will lie in various motionless poses to simulate being dead. In the U.S., the iconography of the pink triangle (originally utilized by Nazi Germany during its persecution of LGBT people) and the slogan 'Silence=Death' together is common. Activists placed versions of the image across New York City during the worst times of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s. It's since been printed on t-shirts and in other types of media. History of anti-disease activism by region =History of anti-disease activism in Africa= The widespread belief in various misconceptions about HIV/AIDS has resulted in a serious handicap holding back treatment in certain parts of Africa. Activists have worked in a variety of different nations to promote effective treatment and to fight back against the myth. One particular example that's drawn international media attention is the 'virgin cleansing myth', with some communities in Africa believing that sex with a un-experienced partner can cure either AIDS or the underlying HIV infection itself. Activist Betty Makoni is one particular individual who has repeatedly worked to dispel the myth; in 1999, she founded the charity Girl Child Network to support Zimbabwe's young sex abuse victims. ACT UP protesters in New York City demonstrate against Uganda's controversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill. In terms of social activism against governments, the controversial 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Bill of Uganda, which aimed at making homosexual sex a criminal offense, earned condemnation from individual activists as well as from groups such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Said organization stated that excluding marginalised groups would compromise efforts to stop the spread of AIDS in Uganda, a social problem to the point that a full 5.4% of the adult population had been infected with HIV by the year 2007.A Global View of HIV Infection, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (2008). Retrieved 4 January 2019. Struggles against HIV/AIDS have been a persistent problem in South Africa specifically, with over five million of the nation's people being HIV positive as of 2004 data. In the shadow of the collapsed apartheid system, the country- wide debate on the disease has focused on the intense conflict between social activists aligned with the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the nation's government. Official support for AIDS denialism and the administering of what has been seen as inadequate access to HIV treatment outraged activists who viewed the government's policies as a denial of their basic right to life. Efforts by the TAC and associated individuals proved success when, in September 2003, the South African Cabinet finally instructed the country's health ministry to create a comprehensive HIV treatment and prevention plan. Later commentators have considered the TAC campaign as one of the most successful if not the most successful example of civil society pushing for human rights in South Africa since the end of apartheid.\\"The Treatment Action Campaign and the History of Rights-Based, Patient-Driven HIV/AIDS Activism in South Africa\\". HIV prevalence varies drastically from country to country inside Africa. For example, UNAIDS research in 2007 found that 23.9% of adults in Botswana had been inflected in comparison to the values of 12.5% in Mozambique and 2.8% in Rwanda. The South Africa and Zimbabwe had values of 18.1% and 15.3%, respectively. =History of anti-disease activism in North America= While the initial timeline of when and how HIV/AIDS crossed over into being a human infection is unclear, the timeline of early HIV/AIDS cases being under scientific dispute, the disease's spread in the United States began to reach a critical mass in the late 1970s and early 1980s period. Because of the long incubation period of HIV, which can go on for over a decade while symptoms of AIDS gradually appear, HIV was not noticed at first by health professionals. The initially low incidence made detection even more tricky. By the time the first reported cases of AIDS were found in large U.S. cities such as New York City, the prevalence of HIV infection had passed 5% in some communities. The AIDS epidemic officially began on 5 June 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued findings in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report newsletter of unusual clusters of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) caused by a form of pneumocystis carinii (now recognized as a distinct species titled pneumocystis jirovecii). The report looked specifically at five homosexual men in the Los Angeles area. Publications such as the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times gave the CDC's findings news coverage. June 1981 additionally saw the first AIDS patient getting received into care under the aegis of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). By August 1981, the CDC reported a full 108 cases of the new disease across America. By 1982, Representative Henry Waxman of California held the first congressional hearing exploring HIV/AIDS. The CDC estimated that tens of thousands would likely get affected by the disease. A change in terminology meant the proliferation of the new, CDC-coined name of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). During her tenure as Mayor of San Francisco, politician Dianne Feinstein declared the first \\"AIDS Awareness Week\\" event. That same year, a group of New Yorkers (Nathan Fain, Larry Kramer, Larry Mass, Paul Popham, Paul Rapoport, and Edmund White) officially established the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). An answering machine in the home of GMHC volunteer Rodger McFarlane, who later served as GMHC's first paid director, became the world's first AIDS hotline. It notably received over one hundred calls the first night. Besides functioning as a hub for social activism, GMHC established what are known as 'buddy programs' to provide people with AIDS with help during day-to-day events. In 1982 as well, activists Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz published How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach. In this short work, they described ways gay men could be sexual and affectionate while dramatically reducing the risk of contracting or spreading HIV. Both authors, gay men living with AIDS, set out the booklet as one of the first times men were advised to use condoms when having sexual relations with other men. In 1983, the GMHC sponsored a benefit performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which served as the first major fund-raising event for AIDS. That same year, the official AIDS Candlelight Memorial was held for the first time. In terms of direct social activism, the organization Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the world's first AIDS discrimination suit, receiving assistance from the GMHC. In 1984, Dianne Feinstein, then mayor of San Francisco, declared the first \\"AIDS Awareness Week\\" event. Featuring the primary goal of educating staff and students from San Francisco Community College District, it involved informing people about causes, effects, and symptoms of AIDS as well as prevention methods. 1984 additionally saw the very first laboratory isolation of HIV, the breakthrough coming the separate research efforts of Dr. Luc Montagnier in France and Dr. Robert Gallo in the U.S. By 1985, publications such as Annals of Internal Medicine warned that \\"even if all transmission of the virus were to stop immediately, the... syndrome would continue to be a major public health problem for the foreseeable future.\\" That year additionally saw the rise to prominence of HIV/AIDS activist Ryan White, an Indiana teenager with AIDS who got barred from his school due to his status, and his life's work of speaking out publicly against AIDS stigma and discrimination. White eventually succumbed to the disease in 1990, dying at the age of eighteen. AIDS Memorial Quilt is pictured as laid out beside the Washington Monument One of the most prominent forms of HIV/AIDS activism has been the creation of and public showings of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. Conceived in 1985 by activist Cleve Jones during a candlelight march held in remembrance of the 1978 assassinations of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, the idea came about after Jones requested people write the names of loved ones who died due to AIDS-related causes on signs. Those got taped to the old San Francisco Federal Building. The scene at the side of the building looked like an enormous patchwork quilt to Jones, and he felt inspired to try and make the concept into a reality. The quilt represented an inflection point within Jones' own life, the openly gay man have suffered from internalized homophobia and thoughts of suicide in his earlier years. The first public display of the project was at San Francisco City Hall in 1987. One of the most prominent HIV/AIDS activist groups, ACT UP, got its start in 1987 at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York State. Larry Kramer talked as part of a rotating series of speakers, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS while condemning the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) group. Though a founder of GMHC, Kramer resigned due to his perceiving of the organization as politically impotent. During the 1980s and 1990s as well as onward, ACT UP focused on strident public demonstration aimed at shocking mainstream public opinion. For example, the group's 11 October 1988 protest picked up national media coverage as it successfully shut down the headquarters of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a day. \\"Hey, hey, FDA, how many people have you killed today?\\" chanted a crowd estimated by ACT UP at between 1,100 and 1,500 people. The protesters additionally hoisted a black banner that simply read \\"Federal Death Administration\\" as well as hoisted an effigy of then President Ronald Reagan. The Atlantic later called it one of the most successful demonstrations during the time of the AIDS crisis. That same year, funding for national, regional, and community-based organizations to fight HIV/AIDS began. Comprehensive school-based education to begin teaching the young about the disease got started back in 1987. Other changes due to activist pressure at the end of the 1980s were a reversal in the U.S. Department of Justice's decision making such that preventing discrimination against HIV patients became government policy plus a lowering of the price of AZT by 20%, the drug being one of the first effective treatments against HIV but having prohibitively massive costs at first. The former policy change became a matter of federal law in 1990 when President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In terms of disease prevalence more generally, AIDS incidence increased rapidly through the 1980s only to peak in the early 1990s and subsequently decline into the dawn of the 21st century. Activism meant by the early 1990s the FDA started a process known as \\"accelerated approval\\" that got experimental yet promising drugs to individuals with AIDS faster. In 2001, a CDC analysis of cases from 1981 through 2000 found that a full 774,467 persons had been reported with AIDS in the U.S. Of that total, 448,060 had died compared to 3542 persons with unknown vital status. The study's findings of 322,865 individuals living with AIDS were the highest ever reported.\\"HIV and AIDS --- United States, 1981‚Äî2000\\". MMWR Weekly. 1 June 2001 / 50(21); 430‚Äì434. Retrieved 4 January 2018. UNAIDS data collected in 2007 stated that 0.6% of adults in the U.S. had HIV in comparison to 0.4% of Canadian adults. International AIDS Conference that was held within Washington, D.C., in 2012 In terms of social change in the new tens, HIV/AIDS activists succeeded in pushing the Obama administration to issue an report finding that laws making HIV transmission a criminal offense do little to influence behavior while many \\"run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and effective measures of HIV prevention.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your- health/wp/2017/10/09/knowingly-infecting-others-with-hiv-is-no-longer-a- felony-in-california-advocates-say-it-targeted-sex-workers Activists additionally scored a major victory in October 2018 when California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law that made knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV into a misdemeanor crime instead of a felony. WNYC labeled the change as \\"a legal and cultural milestone for the way Americans perceive HIV and AIDS.\\" The activist organization Treatment Action Group (TAG) celebrated a victory in 2018 as well given that global spending on fighting tuberculosis hit a record high for 2017 compared to previous years. From 2016 to 2017, research spending jumped to $772 million from $726 million. TAG has spent years upon years pushing for better treatment of tuberculosis while taking careful note of the disease's status as a frequent problem for individuals with AIDS.doi: 10.1038/d41586-018-07708-z =History of anti-disease activism in Europe= A obelisk stands in memorial to victims of AIDS inside a Heidelberg, (Germany) cemetery Cases of mysterious deaths in Europe during the early 1980s caused the proliferation of discrimination, fear, and stigma like in other areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) has remarked in a statement that \\"AIDS was‚Äîand in absolute, global terms still is‚Äîa stinging challenge to the values of modernity received, for better or worse, from Europe's Age of Enlightenment... [since] [a]ffluent, confident, gender- progressive, often social-democratic welfare states awoke, in the early 1980s, to an uncomfortable reminder of their human frailty.\\" On example of the extreme reactions by some politicians is far-right French figure Jean-Marie Le Pen and his proposal of confining people with HIV/AIDS in prison-like facilities. European politics have frequently involved championing the fight against HIV/AIDS as a human rights issue. Health care itself is also fundamentally seen as a matter of fundamental rights, requiring major government investment and regulation. Despite this, social changes have taken place since the world economic recession of the late 2000s that have shifted budgets' focus toward cost containment and increased efficiency. One of the world's most important anti-disease events got started in central Europe. Held yearly on 1 December, World AIDS Day was first conceived in August 1987 by James W. Bunn and Thomas Netter. The two public information officers worked for the Global Programme on AIDS at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Bunn later commented to NPR about his motivations at the time, stating that: =History of anti-disease activism in South America= A massive condom was placed on the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, Argentina as part of an awareness campaign for the 2005 World AIDS Day The regions of Latin America and the Caribbean contains a significantly large number of HIV cases. According to data from UNAIDS, this goes all the way up to two million people living with the disease. HIV/AIDS activism has taken place under the atmosphere of pervasive media bias against those diagnosed, particularly given the use of language such as \\"contagion\\" and \\"infection\\" in non-medical contexts. According to Luis E. Soto-Ram√≠rez of Science: As with Africa, HIV prevalence differs notably from country to country inside Latin America and the Caribbean, although the values don't vary to the extent as in between African nations. For example, UNAIDS research in 2007 found that 3.0% of adults in the Bahamas had been inflected in comparison to the values of 1.1% in the Dominican Republic and 0.1% in Cuba. When looking at new cases of infection, reporting presented at the International AIDS Conference held within Durban, South Africa in 2016 stated that only Chile and Uruguay managed to achieve a small reduction. Nations such as Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador among others had data showing worsening trends. Analysis of anti-disease activism A 2018 report published by MD found that while efforts by ACT UP \\"arguably hastened the science, treatments and services for persons with HIV/AIDS\\", there still remained \\"found long-term effects on the activists\\" such as \\"concurrent posttraumatic stress responses and posttraumatic growth that are distinct from the experiences of persons affected by the illness but not involved with the campaign.\\" However, the activists expressed gratitude for the opportunity to be a part of a close, positively-focused community. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has stated as an organization that the \\"pressure of activists demanding early access to promising AIDS treatments\\" prompted fundamental changes within it. Activists managed to bust \\"the 'ivory tower' mentality wide open and forever\\" altered the specific paths \\"the search for treatments at NIH is conducted\\". The organization has credited the activists both with pushing to have drugs in the experimental stage more widely available for patients as well as more broadly having made stopping AIDS a systematic research priority.

The parish was formally organized in 1836 after a missionary visit from Bishop Jackson Kemper. The present-day church building was erected in 1886 on the corner of 1st and Chestnut St. in downtown Evansville to replace the parish's first church built on the same site. Designed by architects James W. Reid & Merritt J. Reid, the English Gothic Revival-style structure was constructed with Bedford limestone and trimmed with Green River limestone. St. Paul's is known for being the home parish of various prominent figures in Evansville's history. It is also known for its community service, including a weekend soup kitchen through Sr. Joanna's Table. St. Paul's Episcopal Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1978 as part of the larger Riverside Historic District in downtown Evansville. Note: This includes , Site map 1, Site map 2, Quad map, and Accompanying photographs History Evansville's first Episcopalians organized themselves as St. Paul's parish, the first Protestant Episcopal parish in Evansville on January 9, 1836. Rev. Archibald H. Lamon served as the first rector from 1836-1844. The congregation met in the first Vanderburgh County Courthouse until January 12, 1840, when the first church building on 1st and Chestnut was consecrated by Bishop Jackson Kemper. After Rev. Lamon left the congregation in March 1844 to pursue missionary work in Louisiana, the congregation went through a series of rectors as follows: * Rev. B.H. Hicox (invited 1844, died before assuming duties) * Rev. William Vaux (1844-1845, educated in England, brought to America by Bishop Kemper, left to become US army chaplain on the western frontier) * Rev. N.A. Okeson (1845-1846) * Rev. Colley A. Foster (1847-1856) * Rev. Anthony Ten Broeck (1856-1857) * Rev. Sidney Wilbur (1857-1859) * Rev. Elias Birdsall (1860-1864, left to become the first rector of St. Athanasius Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, the first Protestant Episcopal parish in Southern California) * Rev. H.W. Spaulding (1865-1867) * Rev. W.H. Van Antwerp (1868-1874) * Rev. W.N. Webbe (1874-1879) * Rev. Theodore I. Holcombe (1880-1881) * Rev. Charles Morris (1881-1894) Under the leadership of Rev. Morris, St. Paul's Episcopal parish vestry passed a resolution to build a new church building. The final service in the first church building was held on April 15, 1883. While construction ensued, a congregant and frequent benefactor, Charles Viele, offered the use of Viele Hall (located on 2nd street between Main and Sycamore streets) to St. Paul's parish. The cornerstone for new St. Paul's was laid on September 3, 1883, and construction completed on March 2, 1886 with Bishop D.B. Knickerbacker consecrating the new building. Charles and Mary Viele continued to sponsor further construction on the church grounds - first with a rectory (1886) and later a chapel named in honor of the Viele family (1887). The next series of rectors were as follows: * Rev. W. Northey Jones (1894-1897) * Rev. Joseph Marshall Francis (1897-1899, later became Bishop of Diocese of Indianapolis) * Rev. Dr. John Davis (1899-1904, a former theology teacher at an Episcopal mission in Japan) * Rev. William Reid Cross (1904-1911) * Rev. John Boden (1911-1913) * Rev. Horace Weeks Jones (1914, died in an automobile accident) * Rev. A.L. Murray (1914-1918) * Rev. W.R. Plummer (1918-1923, died during mid-week service in Viele chapel of heart attack) * Rev. E. Ainger Powell (1923-1931), later became rector of Christ Church Cathedral in Indianapolis * Rev. Joseph G. Moore (1932-1943) Rev. Moore served as a dynamic leader not only at St. Paul's but also in the broader Southwestern Indiana community. During the Great Depression when nearby Episcopal churches could not afford full-time clergy, he made time to visit these parishes for services to keep them open. He formed a cadre of laypeople assist him in these services, which became known as the Evansville Associate Mission of Southwestern Indiana. Rev. Moore also was a strong advocate for civil rights causes. He held the position of National Field Secretary for the Church League for Industrial Democracy, which brought him into contact with activists AJ Muste & Claude C Williams, Leon Trotsky's bodyguard Henry Schnautz, and other socialists of the 1930s. Rev. Moore supported local labor unions and condemned corrupt local elections through the League for Clean Elections. Rev. Moore also played a significant role in creating better race relations in Evansville. During World War II, Rev. Moore & the vestry invited a group of black workers in the Civilian Conservation Corps & their African-American Episcopalian chaplain to worship at St. Paul's on Sundays - the first documented integrated church service in Evansville. This action was taken despite the bishop's opposition to a previously integrated mid-week service. In addition, Rev. Moore brought future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall to Evansville for help in creating a local chapter of the NAACP. In 1937, Evansville experienced a severe flood which severely damaged the interior of St. Paul's. The flood damage later contributed to the shorting out of wiring connected to the organ, causing a massive fire on March 27, 1938. Between the flood and the fire, the interior was gutted and remodeled while the exterior stonework remained. After Rev. Moore left to become a US army chaplain in February 1943, Rev. Imri Blackburn became rector and served until February 14, 1954 when he resigned to accept a professorship at Seabury Western Seminary. The next series of rectors followed: * Rev. W. Robert Webb (1954-1971) * Rev. Richard Wyatt (1972-1978) * Rev. Thomas N. Sandy (1978-1985) * Rev. Henry Doherty (1985-1987) * Rev. James B. Hempstead (1990-1998) * Rev. Shane Scott-Hamblen (1999-2002) * Rev. J. Raymond Lord (2002-2003) * Rev. Richard R. Godbold (2003-2016) In 2017, St. Paul's vestry invited Rev. Holly Rankin Zaher to be the first female rector of the parish. =Notable people= * Charles Harvey Denby * Edwin Denby (politician) * Charles Denby Jr. * Gordon Granger, married his wife Maria at St. Paul's in 1869 Worship services * Sunday worship services: 8 a.m. (Rite I), 10:30 a.m. (Rite II with sung choral) * Weekday worship services: Eucharist at noon Pictures St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Evansville, Indiana).jpg Wow stpaul.jpg Baptismalfont.jpgBaptismal Font & Northside Facing Stained Glass Window Service123.jpg References External links * stpaulsevv.org Category:Episcopal Church in Indiana Category:Churches in Evansville, Indiana Category:Churches completed in 1886 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Evansville, Indiana Category:Religious organizations established in 1836 Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Indiana ","title":"St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Evansville, Indiana)"},{"id":"59570758","text":"Murder Mountain, originally marketed as 'Murder Mountain: Welcome to Humboldt County,' is an American true crime documentary television series that premiered on Fusion TV on September 23, 2018.

In the decades after it took place, widespread celebrations have been held to celebrate its anniversaries. 10th anniversary The Apollo 11 crew, who had not appeared publicly since the 5th anniversary, participated in ceremonies in Washington D.C. on July 20, 1979.  15th anniversary  A model rocket launch, closed to the public due to the explosives involved, occurred at Kennedy Space Center in 1984.  20th anniversary  20th anniversary logo On the 20th anniversary in 1989, President George H.W. Bush announced plans to return to the Moon and then to Mars, known as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). The USPS released a stamp designed by Chris Calle, son of Paul Calle, the artist that designed the Apollo 11 stamp issued in 1969. The $2.40 priority mail stamp depicts two astronauts planting a flag on the Moon. Living people cannot be featured on US stamps, but the faces of the astronauts are obscured by their visors. It was released July 20 at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.  25th anniversary  25th anniversary logo On July 16, 1994, NASA held a replay of the countdown and launched scale models of the Saturn rocket. The Apollo 11 astronauts declined to attend. They had attended the event five years prior. The United States Postal Service (USPS) issued two stamps, a 29 cent vertical stamp and a $9.95 express mail stamp, to commemorate the anniversary. The 29 cent stamp depicts an astronaut saluting a flag on the Moon; the express mail stamp shows a zoomed-out version of the same scene. They were designed by Paul and Chris Calle. The stamp design was unveiled July 20 by Aldrin in Washington. The Apollo 11 crew accepted an invitation to the White House on July 21 to celebrate the event. President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and other members of Apollo flight crews were among the attendees. PBS released a documentary, Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back.  30th anniversary  Aldrin and Armstrong at a press conference in Mission Control for the anniversary On the 30th anniversary in 1999, Vice-President Al Gore awarded the astronauts with the Langley Gold Medal for aviation. This was the twenty-second time the award had been given out. The ceremony was held at the National Air and Space Museum. On receiving the medal, Armstrong said, \\"We the Apollo 11 crew are enormously appreciative of being asked to receive this Langley Medal and we do so on behalf of all the men and women of the Apollo program.\\" Armstrong attended a banquet at Kennedy Space Center but declined to sign autographs or make a speech. Aldrin attended the event as well; Collins declined, as he was retired. Aldrin held a public briefing on July 17 at the center. The USPS issued a 33-cent stamp as part of a series of stamps that commemorated events that occurred in the 1960s. The stamp, named \\"Man Walks on Moon\\", is Scott catalogue number 3188e, and depicts Aldrin's lunar bootprint. It was unveiled at Kennedy Space Center on July 17. Ground was broke at Kennedy Space Center for the Apollo Exhibit located in the U.S. Space Walk of Fame. The National Air and Space Museum added two new exhibits: Armstrong and Aldrin's helmet and gloves, and the ability to operate a camera inside of the lunar module, allowing visitors to see inside the cockpit for the first time. On July 21, Aldrin was a keynote speaker at the unveiling of a Moon rock at the base of the Tribune Tower in Chicago, Illinois. This marked the first time NASA loaned a lunar sample to a private corporation rather than a school, museum, or planetarium. The rock was removed in 2011 due to an outdated display. A new rock display is planned but has not been installed . The USS Hornet held a ten-day event called Moonfest 1999 at the museum. The event included NASA exhibits and evening astronomy. Aldrin, along with Carl Seilberlich, captain of the Hornet during recovery operations, attended the event on the 24th, the anniversary of the day of the recovery. 17,000 visitors attended the event.  40th anniversary  President Obama meets with crew of Apollo 11 On July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch. From July 16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred. In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments. In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon. On July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\" On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson. A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:  45th anniversary  On July 21, 2014, the Kennedy Space Center Operations and Checkout building was renamed for Armstrong. Aldrin and Collins attended the ceremony.  50th anniversary  Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coin On June 10, 2015, Congressman Bill Posey introduced resolution H.R. 2726 to the 114th session of the United States House of Representatives directing the United States Mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold, silver and clad for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On January 24, 2019, the Mint released the Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website. The USPS created two forever stamps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the mission. The stamps were designed by Antonio Alcal√°. One stamp features the famous image that Armstrong took of Aldrin, with Armstrong visible in Aldrin's faceplate's reflection. The other stamp shows an image of the Moon, taken by Gregory H. Revera, with the Apollo 11 landing site highlighted. The stamps were unveiled at Kennedy Space Center on July 19. Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart was among the celebrities present. The Smithsonian Institute's National Air and Space Museum and NASA sponsored the ‚ÄúApollo 50 Festival‚Äù on the National Mall in Washington DC. The three day (July 18 to 20, 2019) outdoor festival featured hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as Adam Savage and NASA scientists. A photo taken during the Apollo 11 50th anniversary show of the Apollo 11 rocket projected on the Washington Monument in Washington, DC on July 20, 2019 As part of the festival was a projection of the tall Saturn V rocket on the east face of the tall Washington Monument from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30pm until 11:30pm (EDT). There was also a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the Saturn V rocket. The projection was combined with a wide recreation of the Kennedy Space Center countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the Moon landing. The shows were at 9:30pm, 10:30pm, and 11:30pm on Friday, July 19, and Saturday, July 20, with the 10:30pm show on Saturday delayed slightly so the portion of the show where Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event (10:56:15 EDT). A documentary film, Apollo 11, with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in IMAX on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8. On July 19, 2019, the Google Doodle paid tribute to the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, complete with a link to an animated YouTube video with voiceover by astronaut Michael Collins. Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, Rick Armstrong (Neil's son), Mark Armstrong (Rick's son), and others were hosted by President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Trump had also honored Aldrin, Gene Kranz, and the Apollo 11 mission in the 2019 State of the Union Address and the 2019 Salute to America event at the National Mall.

Description Sarcochilus dilatatus is a small epiphytic herb with a stem long with between four and twelve thin, leathery, dark green leaves long and about wide. Between two and twelve brown or dark reddish brown flowers long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem long. The tips of the sepals and petals are often dilated. The dorsal sepal is long and wide whilst the lateral sepals are slightly longer. The petals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal. The labellum is white with yellow and reddish brown markings, about long and wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect with reddish brown lines and the middle lobe short and fleshy with a yellow tip. Flowering occurs between September and October. Taxonomy and naming Sarcochilus dilatatus was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected near Moreton Bay by Walter Hill. Distribution and habitat The brown butterfly orchid usually grows on trees, often hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), in drier rainforest. It is found from Carnarvon Gorge and Gladstone in Queensland south to the Richmond River in New South Wales. Conservation Sarcochilus dilatatus is very rare in New South Wales with only a single recent record from that state and it is classed as \\"endangered\\" there. The main threats to the species are weed invasion and illegal collecting.

It is the debut novel of the character Quiller, who was ultimately featured in a series of 19 thrillers, until Trevor's death in 1995, having been Trevor's most popular character. In Britain, The Bookseller reported that the novel was one of Collins' best selling works in spring 1965. Portions of it were serialized in the Daily Mail. By June 1965, The Publishers Association had The Berlin Memorandum in its top 5 best sellers list for fiction in Britain. The work won the 1966 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel. It also won the 1966 Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re for best international crime novel. Guide des Prix litt√©raires, online ed. Le Rayon du Polar. p. 33. Anthony Boucher, writing for The New York Times Book Review, subsequently said that The Quiller Memorandum had attracted a \\"large body of readers\\" and that it was \\"one of the small handful of truly distinguished spy novels of the 1960s.\\" It has been considered part of a wave of spy novels influenced by John le Carr√©'s groundbreaking 1963 work The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. In fact, Trevor later said he had been inspired by reading a review of (but not, fearing he might take too close an influence, the actual text of) The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. It was adapted as the 1966 film The Quiller Memorandum starring George Segal based on a screenplay written by Harold Pinter. The film took many departures from the novel, including making Quiller an American, and Trevor was unhappy with Pinter's work on it. Collins then republished the novel as The Quiller Memorandum in the UK in 1967, to capitalise on the film. The Quiller Memorandum was republished in 2004 by Forge Books, with an introduction by Otto Penzler.  Plot summary  Quiller is introduced as a serving British intelligence officer in a black organization called \\"the Bureau\\" and as a veteran of clandestine service during World War II. Quiller never states which service he worked in during wartime, and we are not told the year in which that organization was founded. It is, however, mentioned the original explicit purpose of the Bureau was to prevent any possible resurgence of German militarism, any situation that might lead to something resembling a Fourth Reich. Numerous governments offered him medals for his actions in the war, but he refused them all. During and after his wartime service, Quiller became a specialist in understanding Nazi clandestine organizations and their activities, particularly the so-called \\"ratlines\\" used by Nazis to escape from justice. Most of the book takes place in 1965, by which time Quiller has been seconded by the Bureau to secretly provide large amounts of useful intelligence information to West Germany's main war crimes investigation agency, the Z Commission. Quiller is tired and wants to return home, but the Bureau persuades him to investigate the plans of a Nazi secret society. He agrees to do so in part because that secret society has just assassinated a friend and colleague whom he had deeply respected.

It starts by purporting to be the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that they have locked the computer or smart phone due to \\"illegal activities\\" and demands a ransom payment via GreenDot MoneyPak cards in order to release the device.  Operation  The FBI ransomware starts often by being downloaded accidentally or visiting a corrupt website and running an application with a modified JavaScript code. The virus starts with a splash screen that contains the FBI's official logo with a warning that the computer has been locked. Depending on the version, the reason given is either because of alleged copyright violations or because of purported child pornography offences. It will also show the supposed IP address and sometimes a still from the user's webcam. The virus then demands between $100 and $400 paid via pre-paid MoneyPak cards in order to release the computer. If the payment is not made, then it alleges it will open a criminal investigation into the owner. The virus does create an iframe loop which prevents the user exiting the browser or website. The virus will be installed on the infected device so it still requires removal from the device.  Reaction  In 2012, the FBI published advice relating to the FBI MoneyPak virus, telling people not to pay the ransom as it was not from the official FBI and confirmed it was not the real FBI who had locked the computers. They also stated that users should go through authorized PC security firms to remove the ransomware or inform the IC3 ‚Äì Internet Crime Complaint Center. In 2018, the FBI announced that working with the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency (NCA), they had arrested a number of people distributing the malware in the United States and that the NCA had arrested the creator of the virus in the United Kingdom. Some people had been fooled into thinking that the virus was a legitimate warning from the FBI. One man complained about the FBI blocking his phone for child pornography which was attributed to the virus; however, he had admitted that he did have child pornography and was arrested by the police.

Shaughnessy was an American politician who served as Mayor of Waltham, Massachusetts. Early life Shaughnessy was a graduate of St. Mary's High School, Northeastern University, and the Boston University School of Law. During World War II, Shaughnessy served in the United States Navy. Political career Shaughnessy began his political career in 1941 when he was elected to the Waltham School Committee. He was the youngest person ever elected to the position. In 1947, 1949, 1951, and 1953, Shaughnessy was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Waltham. In 1950 he finished third in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth. In 1952 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Southern Middlesex Registrar of Deeds. In 1954 he ran for Middlesex County District Attorney. He lost the Democratic primary to Joseph V. Carroll 23,289 votes to 23,093. In 1955, Shaughnessy defeated incumbent Henry A. Turner to become Mayor of Waltham. During his tenure, Shaughnessy fired several city officials, clashed with the city council, banned government employees from leaving City Hall for coffee breaks, and commandeered the police chief's car after the city council refused to appropriate funds for a new mayoral vehicle. Elected the age of 36, he was the youngest Mayor in the city's history. He was succeeded by the city's oldest mayor, Austin D. Rhodes, after the 72 year old retired business executive defeated Shaughnessy in 1957. In 1958, Shaughnessy was appointed to the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission by Governor Foster Furcolo. In 1959, Peabody Mayor Philip C. O'Donnell was appointed to succeed Shaughnessy. According to Furcolo's office, Shaughnessy resigned from the position on November 15, 1958. Shaughnessy, however, contended he was forced to sign a letter of resignation before he could receive the appointment and therefore his resignation was invalid. State Attorney General Edward J. McCormack advised the Massachusetts Governor's Council that \\"there is a presumption of regularity that in fact a resignation was submitted by Shaughnessy and acted upon by the governor\\" and the Council approved O'Donnell's nomination. In 1962 he was appointed legal adviser to the Federal Housing Administration in New England and New York by President John F. Kennedy. In 1965 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Waltham.

Its nearest higher peak is Ringrose Peak, to the east. History In 1894 Samuel E.S. Allen named it \\"yukness\\" for the Stoney language expression for \\"sharpened with a knife\\" because it does appear as a knife-edge peak when viewed from Lake O'Hara. Lake O'Hara with Yukness to right Walter Wilcox wrote about Lake O'Hara and Yukness Mountain: \\"Soon we came upon the western end of as beautiful a lake as I have ever seen. While showing neither glaciers nor snow upon the immediate peaks, the immense walls to the left and the cliffs and ideally pyramidal peak to the right formed a foreground of wonderful grandeur. The northwest end on which we stood fringed the emerald water with a growth of pine. The south east end facing us was encircled with cliffs five hundred feet in height, from whose summit, piled high with the rocks of an old moraine, three slender waterfalls leaped into the lake. This lake, about a mile in length and slightly less in width, I have known as Lake O'Hara. Ascending the cliffs upon our left by a gully we reached the glacial dam. The bed of an ancient glacier behind this is occupied by a very small lake, at the base of the sharp peak of which I spoke, and which I called by the Indian equivalent, Yukness.\\"Eternal Lake O'Hara, Carol Ann Sokoloff author, 1993, Ekstasis Editions Canada The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1918 by a survey party. The mountain's name was made official in 1952 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada after it had been incorrectly changed to Mount Yukness. Geology Yukness Mountain reflected in Lake O'Hara Yukness Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Yukness Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C.

As of 2020 ChangXin can manufacture LPDDR4 and DDR4 RAM on a 19nm process. History Together with JHICC (Fujian Jin Hua Integrated Circuit) and Xi'an UniIC Semiconductors, Innotron was one of a set of Chinese semiconductor plants established in 2016 to compete with global manufacturers of computer memory. In early 2017, a $7.2 billion deal for a 125,000, 12\\" (300mm) wafer per month production fabrication plant was announced. Innotron's factory was completed by mid-2017 and production equipment was installed at the plant in late 2017. Trials and mass production were scheduled for late 2018 and early 2019. In late 2018, CEO Zhu Yiming was reported to have visited ASML to discuss the purchase of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. Initially, Innotron was thought to have chosen 8Gb LPDDR4 memory as its first product. At the time, analysts claimed that patent and IP issues would present a barrier to its competing with major manufacturers. In mid-2018, trial production of 19 nm 8Gb LPDDR4 was reported to have begun. Innotron's initial capacity was ~20,000 wafers per month, a small output in terms of the industry as a whole. In mid 2019 Innotron, which had changed its name to Changxin Memory Technologies, was reported to have made some design changes in an attempt to avoid possible technology related sanctions deriving from the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war. In Dec 2019 in an interview with EE Times the company stated its first Fab was in productions, and producing 20,000 wafers per month, making 8Gbit LPDDR4 and DDR4 DRAM at 19 nm. The company is reported to increase production to 3% of world DRAM output, or about 40,000 wafers a month by the end of 2020. Facilities As of late 2019 CXMT has over 3,000 employees and runs a fab with a 65,000 square meters clean room space. Over 70% of its employees are engineers working on various R&D-related; projects. CXMT uses its 10G1 process technology (aka 19 nm) to make 4 Gb and 8 Gb DDR4 memory chips. LPDDR4 RAM was added to the product porfolio in 2020.

The dockyard was administered by the Navy Board and was part of the Mediterranean Fleet. History Naval storehouse and careening wharf on Illa Pinto. The Port Mahon Dockyard was established at Port Mahon, one of the world's deepest natural harbours, in 1708, following orders issued by the Admiralty to Admiral Sir George Byng the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Squadron. He was instructed to develop the Port of Mahon as a naval base following the capture of Minorca. The dockyard was located on the north side of the harbour, opposite Port Mahon town. In 1756 control of the dockyard was fought over during the Battle of Minorca (1756). During the 1760s naval storehouses were constructed. The dockyard was the Royal Navy's principal Mediterranean base for much of the eighteenth century; however the territory changed hands more than once in that time, before being finally ceded to Spain in 1802. The dockyard was administered by the Navy Board and was part of the Mediterranean Station.

In partnership with Thomas Fitzsimons, his firm was among the largest provision merchants during the American Revolutionary War, and helped finance the Bank of Pennsylvania and Bank of North America during the conflict‚Äîwhile it profited from British goods as well. Meade's business went bankrupt by 1801 due to investments in the Yazoo land scandal, and was continued by his son Richard W. Meade. Meade held minor city offices and was active in religious and civic life, among others serving as a trustee at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and founding the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. Descendants amplified these accomplishments into a legendary patriotism, though his influence has been assessed more modestly by recent biographers. Early life George Meade was born in Philadelphia, the youngest child of Mary Stretch (or Stritch) and Robert Meade. Mary was from a Barbadian and Philadelphian merchant family; Robert was an Irish immigrant from County Limerick who moved to Philadelphia around 1732. He had lived in either the Bahamas or Barbados, and was a provision merchant who traded with the British Caribbean. He also donated to the establishment of St. Joseph's, the first Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. After becoming sick on St. Croix in July 1754, Robert died between August 13 and 26 at Philadelphia, leaving an estate of ¬£79 11s d. George and his siblings Garrett and Catherine were educated on Barbados by their uncle George Stretch, before returning to their native city.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 26‚Äì28; Klepp writes Robert died at St. Croix. Philadelphia merchant Garrett and George Meade went into business together importing rum, sugar and slaves.Klepp, \\"Meade, George\\". They joined the nonimportation agreement against the Stamp Act of 1765‚Äîa symbolic move because it did not significantly affect their business, unlike the opposition to the Townshend Acts which they abstained from. Catherine married Thomas Fitzsimons; he and George were founders of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, and Fitzsimons joined the firm after Garrett left. Meade & Company invested in western Pennsylvania land as well as the British Caribbean. In April 1775 George joined the Third Battalion of Associators, and in the prelude to independence he served on the Continental Association as well as the Committee on Inspection and Observation.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 31‚Äì32. During the American Revolution‚Äîafter the Meade family briefly fled to Chester County during the British occupation of Philadelphia‚ÄîMeade & Company invested ¬£2,000 in the Bank of Pennsylvania to help fund the Continental Army in 1780, and likewise invested in the Bank of North America. However, the firm also speculated on British stocks and imported British goods via Martinique, thus profiting from both sides of the war; Meade did not serve in any battles.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 33. After the war the firm suffered from the recession of 1783‚Äì1784, and particularly from failed European investments and western land speculation. Fitzsimons left the partnership, which had accumulated a debt of ¬£30,000. Meade saved his business and reputation with a ¬£10,000 loan from Londoner John Barclay, which helped him settle all his debts.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 34‚Äì45; though Campbell, History, p. 120, gives Barclay. In Philadelphia newspapers from 1784 to 1788 he advertised Spanish wines and Caribbean spirits as well as coffee, tea, sugar, molasses, sheet copper and German textiles.Chandler, \\"Catholic Merchants\\", p. 100. A Federalist like the influential Fitzsimons, he marched in the Grand Federal Procession and served in minor political offices: on the Philadelphia Common Council 1789 to 1792 and as chairman of the Board of Management for the Inspectors of the Prisons in 1792.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 35‚Äì38. Meade's temperament, described by descendants as \\"eccentric\\", as well as \\"testy\\" and prone to profanity, may have limited his opportunities.Klepp, \\"Meade, George\\". In religious and civic associations he was more active, serving as a trustee for St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and donating $50 to the construction of St. Augustine's, what would become Georgetown University and (having freed his slaves) he also donated outside his faith to the African Church. In 1763 he had helped found the Fishing Company of Fort St. David. He was a manager of the Philadelphia Dancing Assembly and the Philadelphia Dispensary, in 1790 a founder of the Hibernian Society for the Relief of Emigrants from Ireland and in 1792 vice-president of the Sunday Schools. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, he remained in Philadelphia to aid the sick, occasionally supporting physician Benjamin Rush.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 38‚Äì39. His business definitively failed during the Panic of 1796‚Äì1797 due to investments in the Yazoo land scandal; he had purchased over 230,000 acres of Georgia land between 1794 and 1796. By 1801 he was bankrupt, with his son Richard W. Meade managing his estate, and in 1804 he quit business life altogether.Stowe, A Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 40‚Äì41; Klepp however writes \\"he recovered before his retirement in 1806\\".Campbell, History, p. 120. Personal life and death George Meade married Henrietta Constantia Worsam, the daughter of Barbados planter Richard Worsam, on May 5, 1768. She was Anglican although George was Catholic, a pattern repeated in several generations of the Meade family.Meade, \\"George Meade,\\" p. 208 They had five sons and five daughters, who were baptized Catholic, though all but two predeceased their father‚Äîand many were buried in Protestant churchyards.\\"One Mixed Marriage\\". He died in Philadelphia on November 9, 1808, at age 67, and was buried at St. Mary's. His daughter Elizabeth then followed Henrietta to England, while his son Richard continued the family business. Legacy Meade was not particularly well known in his day, and no collection of his papers survives, but he achieved fame as the grandfather of Civil War general George Gordon Meade. For his role in the American Revolution his profile was sculpted on the Catholic Total Abstinence Union Fountain at the Centennial Exposition.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 41m45s. Richard W. Meade III wrote the article \\"George Meade, a Patriot of the Revolutionary Era\\" in 1891, which was used uncritically by late 19th and early 20th-century sources.Compare Frederick with Klepp. According to his entry in American National Biography, \\"Meade has been included among several founders of elite Philadelphia families who supposedly formed a cohesive, long-lasting national upper class, but little actual evidence supports this claim of inherited greatness. ... [L]ater biographers considered [his] quiet virtues insufficiently heroic for the grandfather of a famous general.\\" See also * John Leamy ‚Äì contemporary Philadelphia merchant Notes Bibliography   Category:1741 births Category:1808 deaths Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Businesspeople from Philadelphia Category:People of Pennsylvania in the American Revolution Category:Meade family ","title":"George Meade (merchant)"},{"id":"59571961","text":"The 1983 Dunedin mayoral election was part of the New Zealand local elections held that same year.

The nearest living relative is the orange horseshoe bat, Rhinonicteris aurantia, which occurs in the same area.  Description  A hipposiderid that resembles the extant species Rhinonicteris aurantia, and related to 'leaf-nosed' bats found on other continents. The leaf-shaped structure is an elaborate and fleshy arrangement that assisted the bat to locate its assumed prey, flying insects, by manipulating the high frequency sound used in echolocation. The ultra high frequency sound is produced in the larynx and emitted through the nose. Like other bats, the shape of the ears was attuned to receive the reflected sound, and is grooved in appearance. As with other hipposiderids, a protuberance at the ear‚Äîthe enlarged and fleshy tragus found in other bat species‚Äîis absent. The wingspan was around 150 millimetres. They inhabited limestone caves in large numbers, up to five thousand, during a period 24-16 million years ago; this is supported by the evidence at Riversleigh, They are thought to have existed until the early Miocene. Another bat species that was fossilised in the region was Australonycteris clarkae, which existed during the early Eocene period (55mya) and is amongst the most ancient to have been discovered. The nearest known relations are extant species in Madagascar and Vietnam and extinct bat taxa in France and the arabian peninsula. The species has been referred to as the Riversleigh leaf-nosed bat.

Career  Born in Br√ºx, as a child ≈†tƒõrbov√° lived in northern Bohemia. She remained there with her German grandmother even after the occupation of the Sudeten regions in 1938 and attended the German school. Her parents lived near Prague in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Because they listened to foreign radio, they were imprisoned for several months. Before graduating from a business school, ≈†tƒõrbov√° made a public appearance with school bands. At the age of 27, she began her semi-professional career as the wife of a lawyer and mother of two children. In a competition for young talents she took 2nd place and shortly afterwards started singing regularly in the Prague Musikhalle Alhambra. ƒåe≈ôovsk√° has never become a full-time singer, even though she has recorded a number of successful hits.Judita ƒåe≈ôovsk√° on Amazon In 1959 she suffered a serious injury in a car accident from which she was able to recover. Without regular collaboration with a large dance orchestra or a renowned singer-songwriter, she was not perceived as a pop star in Czechoslovakia. She became popular abroad. In the Federal Republic of Germany she gave concerts and also directed a TV program. She was also successful in other European countries. In 1967 she sang with some Czechoslovak fellow musicians, among them Karel Gott, at the World Exposition EXPO in Montreal. For family reasons, she refused an offer of engagement for performances in the USA. Since 1989 Judita ƒåe≈ôovsk√° switched to Jazz, Swing and Chanson.

The series is an adaptation of the Japanese super robot anime series Beast King GoLion, which was dubbed into English and edited to create Voltron episodes. Later episodes also use footage from the mecha anime Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. Premise The first season is about five pilots who command 5 robot lions which combine to form Voltron. These pilots use these machines to protect the planet Arus from the evil Warlord King Zarkon and witch Haggar who creates Robeasts to terrorize the planet ruled by Princess Allura. Vehicle Voltron The second season of the show was called Vehicle Voltron based on Armored Fleet Dairugger XV which spawned also a television special called Voltron: Fleet of Doom. The premise of season two is the Galaxy Alliance's home worlds have become overcrowded and search for new planets to colonise. This puts the Alliance in conflict with the Drule empire. Each team is specialized in gathering data or fighting in their area of expertise. Each squad combines their vehicles into a bigger machine, with each vehicle differing among the three teams. These fighters are: * The Aqua Fighter (Sea Team) * The Turbo Terrain Fighter (Land Team) * The Strato Fighter (Air Team) Voice cast *Jack Angel as King Zarkon *Michael Bell as Lance and Sven *Peter Cullen as Narrator and Coran *Neil Ross as Keith and Pidge *B. J. Ward as Haggar and Princess Allura *Lennie Weinrib as Hunk and Prince Lotor *Tress MacNeille as Queen Merla Production and development Ted Koplar assembled a team in Los Angeles to transform GoLion into what would become Voltron. Peter Keefe was brought aboard as Executive Producer, with Franklin Cofod as the Director. Since they had no means of translating the Japanese series into English, Keefe and Cofod surmised the plots, commissioned writer Jameson Brewer to write all-new dialogue, edited out the more violent scenes, and remixed the audio into stereo format. The series was an immediate hit in the United States, topping the syndication market for children's programs in the mid-1980s. The Japanese Future Robot Daltanious series was originally planned to be adapted by World Events Productions as part of Voltron. When requesting master tapes from Toei Animation for translation purposes, the World Events Productions producers requested \\"[the] ones with the lion.\\" Mistakenly, Toei then proceeded to ship World Events copies of Beast King GoLion, another \\"combining-robot\\" cartoon which featured lion-shaped fighting robot starships. Because the World Events producers greatly preferred GoLion to Daltanious, the GoLion episodes were adapted instead, going on to become the most popular portion of the original Voltron run. A third version/series of Voltron based on yet another Japanese series, Lightspeed Electroid Albegas, was also in progress, but it was dropped when World Events Productions joined with Toei to make new GoLion-based shows, due to that show's popularity over the Dairugger run. Changes from the Japanese version Though airing in syndication, which offered other anime shows such as Robotech greater freedom to deal with subject matter such as death that were off-limits in most US network children's programming, WEP's adaptation of Voltron was heavily edited to conform to the more conservative standards of children's television in the United States, as well as the standard name change of characters and concepts in GoLion and Dairugger. =Plot changes= GoLion *In Voltron, the show begins with the five pilots sent by the Galaxy Alliance, whose space-exploration mission takes them to a planet devastated by war. In Voltron, the pilots arrive on Arus and are captured and taken to Planet Doom. They then escape, return to Arus, and become the pilots of the robot lions and Voltron. In GoLion, the initial scenes are actually of Earth; the pilots have returned from their mission (in the then-futuristic year of 1999) to find that the entire population of Earth has been killed in a nuclear war. They are then captured and taken to Planet Galra, where the plot proceeds similarly, only the planet they find the lions on is called Altea. In the Voltron version, some footage of the pilots' arrival on Arus was taken from Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. *Scenes of torture and atrocities inflicted by the alien conquerors on their slaves (such as a \\"contest\\" where alien soldiers would be rewarded according to how many prisoners they managed to decapitate in a given time) and some shots of corpses were removed. *In GoLion, Takashi 'Shiro' Shirogane (Sven in Voltron), the original pilot of Blue Lion, is killed in a battle with Haggar, and his similar-looking younger brother Ryou appears later in the series to join in the fight against Emperor Daibazaal. In Voltron, dialog was inserted to indicate that Sven is merely injured and has been sent away to a hospital planet to recover, and the character of Ryou was rewritten entirely into Sven being enslaved after said planet was taken over, then escaping and managing to reunite with his friends. *In GoLion, Hys (Nanny) is fatally shot in the heart while protecting Raible (Coran). This scene was completely removed from Voltron, and later episodes used stock footage from earlier in the series to insert the character into scenes that took place after her original death. *In GoLion, a slave girl named Lisa was a survivor of the nuclear war. Near the end of her debut episode, Tsuyoshi 'Hothead' Seidou (Hunk in Voltron) urges her to wake up and join in the fight against Emperor Daibazaal (King Zarkon in Voltron), however she is too crushed by her despair to trust even a fellow human (that race being responsible for the destruction of her homeworld) and chooses to step off a cliff the two were standing on, rather than live without her brother. In Voltron, this sequence was removed, and it was explained to the audience that this girl, now named Twyla, had been allowed to go home to her own planet (a planet other than Earth). * In episode 21 of GoLion, there are implications that Prince Sincline (Prince Lotor in Voltron) sexually enslaved Princess Amue (Romelle in Voltron) when she was his prisoner, due to her physical similarities to Princess Fala. The Voltron dialogues imply that he tortured her instead.https://voltronfandomhag.tumblr.com/post/170446803468/getting-your- facts-straight-classic-lotor Episodes Home media The show was released on DVD by the likes of Media Blasters and Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment, and was released on a Complete Series DVD set by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment with their distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation on September 10, 2019.

He was third secretary (1966‚Äì68) and then second secretary (1968‚Äì72) to the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

Retrieved 4 January 2019.\\"Michael Saunders\\", The Times, 19 December 1996, p. 19.  Career  The experience at the Hague Conference gave Saunders a detailed working knowledge of European Union law, which was valued by the ministers he advised. He spent periods in the Treasury Solicitor's Department and the Law Officers' Department, before he was appointed an Assistant Treasury Solicitor in 1979. He returned to the Law Officers' Department four years later and served as its Legal Adviser between 1986 and 1989, when he became Solicitor to HM Revenue and Customs. In 1992, he became Legal Adviser to the Home Office, his final appointment before promotion to HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor in 1995; he was the first appointed to the latter office following open competition. The Times remarked that \\"The mid-1990s at the Home Office were a less happy time ... it is open to conjecture that [Saunders] did not, after, 1993 find the present Home Secretary [Michael Howard] the most congenial of ministers to advise on law. The entanglement of [Howard] with the judiciary ‚Äì especially over the legislation on compensation for victims of crimes of violence ‚Äì was the product of a minister (himself a QC) not listening to his legal adviser\\". Saunders died on 17 December 1996, after a heart attack, the year after his promotion to Treasury Solicitor; his obituary in The Times recorded an \\"outstanding career\\" as a legal adviser to ministers.

Lorinƒç√≠k is located in the Ko≈°ice II district, at an altitude of roughly above sea level. It is one of the westernmost boroughs of Ko≈°ice and retains its traditionally rural character.  History  The first written records of Lorinƒç√≠k date as far back as 1248, when the local area and settlement was known as Gord. The settlement and its name had fallen out of use by the early 16th century, with the name Lorinƒç√≠k replacing it since the 16th century. In the 18th century, Lorinƒç√≠k was possibly abandoned, as it's missing from most records from the period, though it reemerges again as a settled place by 1808. In the mid-1800s, it's noted as a mostly Slovak village. Lorinƒç√≠k became a borough of Ko≈°ice in the 20th century and has had its own municipal government since 1991. The current Church of St Lawrence in the borough, a protected landmark, was built in 1932. However, the patronage of St Lawrence for the locality dates back to at least the early modern period, when an older chapel or church dedicated to St Lawrence already stood in the area. The etymology of Lorinƒç√≠k (derived from \\"Lawrence\\") seems to be based on the traditional use of this specific patron saint in the former village.

The survey attempts to contact all recipients of higher education qualifications approximately 15 months after graduation. It aims to gather statistics on the employment and study activities of graduates, and their subjective opinions on the value of their higher education and qualifications. The survey is delivered by HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) to help universities and colleges fulfil their legal requirement to report on the outcomes of higher education to the UK higher education funding and regulatory bodies (e.g. the Office for Students). Background The Graduate Outcomes survey replaces the former Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey. Whereas the DLHE survey was undertaken by universities contacting their own graduates 6 months after graduation, the Graduate Outcomes survey is run centrally by HESA 15 months after graduation using contact details provided by universities and colleges. The survey was launched in December 2018 with a survey of graduates who gained qualifications in August to October 2017. Methodology The survey takes the form of an online questionnaire distributed by email to graduates who gained a higher education qualification. Graduates are also contacted by telephone if they do not complete the online survey, or if a valid email address is not available. Universities and colleges who award higher education qualifications in the UK are legally obliged to participate in the survey and provide contact details of their graduates to HESA or the Office for Students. Completion of the survey is voluntary for graduates, but the survey aims for a high response rate to generate representative statistics on the outcomes of publicly funded and regulated higher education.

Biography  Yitzhak Yaakov Rabinovich was born in 1854 in Shereshevo, Belorussia in a wealth family of merchant. He received private education of Talmud and at the age of 14 moved out of home to Selets in order to study with Yeruham Perlman ‚Äî who later became noted rabbi of Minsk. A few years later Rabinovich, together with Chaim Soloveitchik moved to Brest- Litovsk. While studying together two of them developed new method of studying Talmud: by logic and deep understanding of text - in contrast to the previously long-used method of pilpul (casuistry). In 1889, Rabinovich was appointed a teacher at the Slobodka yeshiva. However, due to challenges in accepting Musar ideology that the school followed, he left in 1894 and became a rabbi in Gorzd, Lithuania. Two years later (in 1896) he has settled in Ponevezh taking rabbi position in town. He took this position after Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, the father-in-law of Avraham Yitzhak Kook. In 1909 he received a substantial amount of money from Moscow Jew, Liba Miriam Gavronskii, daughter of Kalonymus Wissotzky - tea magnate, who wanted to commemorate her husband by opening religious school for promising male students. The money was sufficient to open a kollel, however its popularity, high level of studying but also amount of received grant made it possible to turn this kollel to a yeshiva. Rabinovich held the position of rosh yeshiva at this Ponevezh yeshiva. Rabinovich found it difficult to fund-raise - which was one of the traditional tasks of head of yeshiva. That is why in 1913 he refused the offer to become head of Etz Haim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. In yeshiva in Ponevezh, which was offering generous scholarships to its students, he had not had the problem of fundraising as the yeshiva had its own founding sponsor. Rabinovich is considered progressive in his social and public affairs opinions. In 1910 at the rabbinical congress in Saint Petersburg he supported a resolution which demanded rabbis in Russian empire to know the local language of the country. In 1912 he has supported the newly established Orthodox party Agudat Israel and was elected to the rabbinical council of the party. After lecture of Capital by Karl Marx, Rabinovich turned to further support working class. In 1917, at the meeting of Masoret ve-Herut (Orthodox leaders), he proposed a resolution to endorse redistribution of land to peasants. However his proposal did not reach enough support to be accepted by the meeting. In his teachings and halachic rulings he gained wide support and respect, nevertheless he never published his responsa and novellae. Some of them were preserved by his students and in letters his correspondents received. In 1915, Rabinovich with his students were forced (by approaching Germans and by Russian policy towards Jews) to flee to Latvia and then to Ukraine. After the end of [I World War , in 1919 he returned to Ponevezh, but due to Bolshevik's ruling in the town, he was unable to teach nor to re- establish his yeshiva. Soon after that he died of typhus.  Heritage  His work and teachings found followers and outlived him. At the end of 1919, when Ponevezh returned to Lithuania, the Ponevezh yeshiva was re-opened with Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman as its rosh yeshiva and soon regained its prestige. Under Kahaneman's leadership the school incorporated Musar but teaching curriculum still focused on study of Talmud. Kahandeman was considered not only respected Talmudist but also very effective in fundraising - both locally and in United States. The funds he gathered were mostly used on improving school facilities. The outbreak of World War II caught Kahaneman during his trip to British Mandate Palestine, where he decided to stay however from abroad he continued running the yeshiva. Students were able to continue their studies, even after Red Army entrance to town, seizing the yeshiva's original building and several allocations of yeshiva in different synagogues in town. The situation was dramatically changed after German Nazis entered the town in June 1941. The school building was incorporated into the part of town that was turned into ghetto and yeshiva students were murdered only a few days after Nazi's occupation started. In 1944, in British Mandate Palestine, in new town of Bnei Brak, Kahaneman re-established Ponevezh yeshiva, which is still considered one of the leading yeshivas in Israel, and main in Litvishe Jews tradition. The current yeshiva is still using the name Ponevezh Yeshiva after its original location and to commemorate murdered community of its origin.

He was born in Bonaprise, Cameroon and is presumed to have died in Liberia sometime after 1922. His original name was Quane a Dibobe but he was christened Martin Dibobe by missionaries. At the age of 20 he went to Germany to represent Cameroon (then a German colony) at the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin in 1896 where his role at the Treptower Park was to portray 'African daily life'. Together with many other Africans, all from the then German colonies, he spent six months at the exhibition as an 'exhibit'. When the exhibition ended he stayed in Berlin and started an apprenticeship as a locksmith with the firm Conrad Schultz in Strausberg. Early in 1900 he became engaged to Helene Noster, the daughter of his landlord, and they married in the same year despite objections from the German colonial authorities. In 1902 he worked as a dispatcher with the Berlin U-Bahn soon rising to train driver, first class. As such he rapidly became something of a celebrity. Dibobe kept in touch with his homeland and after the First world war championed the restitution of the former German colonies. He openly sympathised with the views of the German Social Democrats and championed equal status for Africans. Together with 17 other Africans from the former colonies, who proposed that he be their permanent representative to the Reichstag, he presented a petition to that body on 27 June 1919 calling for independence and civil rights for all persons in and from those colonies. In 1922 he decided to return to Africa with his family, and in preparation for this he travelled alone to Cameroon, which was now under French control. The French, fearing that he would instigate a revolt in favour of the Germans, refused to allow him to disembark. He had no alternative but to travel on to Liberia. At this point all trace of him was lost but it seems likely that he died in Liberia.

Knapowski published 53 papers despite dying at only 36 years old. Life and education Stanis≈Çaw Knapowski was the son of Zifia Krysiewicz and Roch Knapowski. His father, Roch Knapowski was a lawyer in Pozna≈Ñ but later taught at Pozna≈Ñ University. The family moved to the Kielce province in south-eastern Poland after the German invasion of 1939 but returned to Pozna≈Ñ after the war. Stanis≈Çaw completed his high school education in 1949 excelling at math and continued on at Pozna≈Ñ University to study mathematics. Later in 1952 he continued his studies at University of Wroc≈Çaw and earned his master's degree in 1954. Knapowski was appointment an assistant at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orlicz and worked towards his doctorate. He studied under the direction of P√°l Tur√°n starting in Lublin in 1956. He published many of his papers with Tur√°n and Tur√°n wrote a short biography of his life and work in 1971 after his death. Knapowski began to work in this area and finished his doctorate in 1957 ‚ÄúZastosowanie metod Turan√° w analitycznej teorii liczb‚Äù (\\"Certain applications of Turan's methods in the analytical theory of numbers\\"). Knapowski had the opportunity to work abroad. He spent a year in Cambridge and worked with Louis J. Mordell and listened to classes by J.W.S. Cassels and Albert Ingham. He then moved on to Belgium, France and The Netherlands. Knapowski returned to Pozna≈Ñ to finish another thesis to complete a post-doctoral qualification needed to lecture at a German university. \\"On new \\"explicit formulas\\" in prime number theory\\" in 1960. In 1962 the Polish Mathematical Society awarded him their Mazurkiewicz Prize and he moved to Tulane University in New Orleans, United States. After a very short return to Poland, he left again and taught in Marburg in Germany, Gainesville, Florida and Miami, Florida. Death Knapowski was a good classical pianist. He was also an avid driver, but he died in a traffic accident where he lost control of his car, leaving the Miami airport. Work Knapowski expanded on the work of others in several fields of number theory, prime number theorem, modular arithmetic and non-Euclidean geometry. =Number of times the Œî(n) prime sign changes= relative error of \\\\tfrac{n}{\\\\log n} and the logarithmic integral \\\\operatorname{Li}(n) as approximations to the prime-counting function. Both relative errors decrease to zero as n grows, but the convergence to zero is much more rapid for the logarithmic integral. Mathematicians work on primality tests to develop easier ways to find prime numbers when finding them by trial division is not practical. This has many applications in cybersecurity. There is no formula to calculate prime numbers. However, the distribution of primes can be statistically modelled. The prime number theorem, which was proven at the end of the 19th century, says that the probability of a randomly chosen number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits (logarithm). At the start of the 19th century, Adrien- Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss suggested that as x goes very large, the number of primes up to x is asymptotic to x/\\\\log x, where \\\\log x is the natural logarithm of x. : \\\\operatorname{li}(n) = \\\\int_0^n \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\log t} where the integral is evaluated at t = n , also fits the distribution. The prime counting function \\\\pi(n) is defined as the number of primes not greater than n., p. 6 . And \\\\Delta(n)=\\\\pi(n)-\\\\operatorname{li}(n) Bernhard Riemann stated that \\\\Delta(n) was always negative but J.E. Littlewood later disproved this. In 1914 J.E. Littlewood proved that there are arbitrarily large values of x for which : \\\\pi(x)>\\\\operatorname{Li}(x) +\\\\frac13\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt x}{\\\\log x}\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log x, and that there are also arbitrarily large values of x for which :\\\\pi(x)<\\\\operatorname{Li}(x) -\\\\frac13\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt x}{\\\\log x}\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log x. Thus the difference (x) ‚àí Li(x) changes sign infinitely many times. Stanley Skewes then added an upper bound on the smallest natural number x: : \\\\pi(x) > \\\\operatorname{li}(x), Knapowski followed this up and published a paper on the number of times \\\\Delta(n) changes sign in the interval \\\\Delta(n) . =Modular arithmetic= Knapowski worked in other areas of number theory. One area was on the distribution of prime numbers in different residue classes modulo k . Modular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\\\\\}, for a natural number n called the modulus. Any other natural number can be mapped into this system by replacing it by its remainder after division by n., Proposition 5.3 , p. 96. The distribution of the primes looks random, without a pattern.

Despite the influence of paleontology on ecological sciences can be traced back at least at the 18th century, the current field has been established by the work of K.W. Flessa and G.P. Dietl in the first decade of the 21st century. The discipline utilizes paleontological and geological data to understand how biotas respond to climate and other natural and anthropogenic environmental change. These information are then used to address the challenges faced by modern conservation biology, like understanding the extinction risk of endangered species, providing baselines for restoration and modelling future scenarios for species range's contraction or expansion.  Description of the discipline  The main strength of conservation paleobiology is the availability of long term data on species, communities and ecosystems that exceeds the timeframe of direct human experience. The discipline takes one of two approaches: near-time and deep-time. = Near-time conservation paleobiology = The near-time approach uses the recent fossil record (usually from the Late Pleistocene or the Holocene) to provide a long-term context to extant ecosystems dynamics. The fossil record is, in many cases, the only source of information on conditions previous to human impacts. These records can be used as reference baselines for comparisons in order to identify targets for restoration ecology, to analyze species responses to perturbations (natural and anthropogenic), understand historical species distributions and their variability, discriminate the factors that distinguish natural from non- natural changes in biological populations and identify ecological legacies only explicable by referring to past events or conditions.  Example - Conservation of the European bison  European bison with juvenile in the Bialowieza Forest The European bison or wisent (Bison bonasus) is a large herbivore once widespread in Europe that saw a range decrease over the last thousand years, surviving only in Central European forests with the last wild population getting extinct in Bialowieza forest in 1921. Starting from 1929, reintroduction of animals from zoos allowed the species to recover in the wild. The historical range of Bison bonasus was limited to forested areas, so since at least the sixteenth century conservation measures to preserve the species were based on the assumption that a forest would be the optimal habitat of the species. Ecological, morphological and paleoecological evidences, however, shows that B. bonasus is best adapted to open or mixed environments, indicating that the species was \\"forced\\" into a suboptimal habitat due to human influences such as habitat loss, competition with livestock, diseases and hunting. This information has been applied recently to adopt measures more suitable for the conservation of the species. = Deep- time conservation paleobiology = The deep-time approach uses examples of species, communities and ecosystem responses to environmental changes on a longer geologic record, as an archive of natural ecological and evolutionary laboratory. This approach provides examples to infer possible settings concerning climate warming, introduction of invasive species and decline in cultural eutrophication. This also permits the identification of species responses to perturbations of various types and scale to serve as a model for the future scenarios, for example abrupt climate change or volcanic winters. Given its deep-time nature, this approach allows for testing how organisms or ecosystems react to a bigger set of conditions than what is observable in the modern world or in the recent past.  Example - Insect damage and increasing temperatures  A pressing issue related to current global warming is the potential expansion in the range of tropical and subtropical crop pests, however the signal related to this poleward expansion is not clear. The analyses of the fossil record form past warm intervals of Earth's history (Paleogene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) provides an adequate comparison to test this hypothesis. Data shows that, during warmer climates, the frequency and diversity of insect damage to North American plants increased significantly, providing support to the hypothesis of pests expansion due to global warming.  Relevance to conservation biology  Over the years, numerous attempts have been made to increase the synergy between paleobiologists and conservation scientists and managers. Despite being recognized as a useful tool to address current biodiversity problems, fossil data is still rarely included in contemporary conservation-related research, with the vast majority of studies focusing on short timescales.

In 1977, he gave up his profession as a hotel and industrial kitchen furnisher and began his career as a freelance artist as a street painter. His interest in batik techniques led him into fabric design. He designed fabric patterns for furniture and decorations. He was also involved in the development of games. Among other things, he invented over 100 games for pad and pencil. The publication of these games in 1986 was the cornerstone of his writing career. Other games and children's books followed very quickly. Through the combination of games and mysticism in the form of fortune telling books, a further focal point of his writing activity arose. In particular, he devoted himself to white magic, which he called theurgy, about which he published several works through Verlag Peter Erd. He also wrote radio plays, a theatre play and comic texts. As a poet he published anthologies. He also devotes himself to haiku poetry, where he contributes to anthologies at home and abroad. The main focus of his artistic work is traditional ink drawing. So far Mala has published 70 books, most of which he has illustrated himself. Three radio plays have been produced and one play performed. There is a literary online project, Gegen√ºber (\\"Opposite\\"), in which he described the view of the house opposite him from the window of his study for a year at the turn of the millennium.

Khlong Phra Khanong was excavated from 1837 to 1840, and rural communities soon settled along its banks. The historical settlement is believed to be the source of the ghost legend of Mae Nak Phra Khanong. Sukhumvit Road was built during the mid-twentieth century, linking Bangkok to the eastern seaboard and bringing development along with it. The new Phra Khanong neighbourhood grew up around Sukhumvit, and became a suburban commercial centre during the late 1970s to early 1980s.

Papy served as the 5th Florida Attorney General from 1853 to 1861.  Early life  Papy was born on October 9, 1824 in the city of St. Augustine, the largest city in the Florida Territory at the time. Though he was born into a poor family, Papy taught himself how to read law. Additionally, he found wealth after an overseer helped him become a successful cotton planter. In 1840, Papy, known for his memory and perceptiveness, was admitted into the Florida Territorial Bar by order of the Florida Territorial Legislative Council despite only begin 16.  Political career  When Florida received statehood in 1845, Papy, a Democrat, was named the first Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court by Governor William Dunn Moseley. He served in this position until 1849, when he returned to private practice. In 1852, he represented Leon County for a single year in the Florida House of Representatives. The following year, Papy was elected to be the fifth Florida Attorney General. He would serve two terms, opting not to run for a third term due to the onset of the American Civil War. During the Civil War, many pro-secessionists in Florida were became increasingly critical of the worsening economy under Governor John Milton. On January 14, 1862, the Florida Secession Convention reconvened and voted to create an executive council to assist the governor. Papy was appointed to the council of four, serving alongside planter Smith Simkins of Jefferson County, James A. Wiggins of Marion County, and W. D. Barnes of Jackson County. Though initially subservient to Milton, the council helped his leadership become more foresighted. Papy retired to private practice after the end of the war.

PDF Morphology Microcotyle victoriae has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a flat slender, symmetrical body, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is symmetrical, distinctly separated from body proper and bears 17-25 pairs of clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two almost circular buccal suckers, provided with a membranous septum at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth with a folded ventral lip, a small and spherical muscular pharynx, and a posterior intestine with two lateral branches of unequal length. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, with spines, a single median dorsal vagina, a single coiled ovary, and 18-22 small and rounded testes which are posterior to the ovary. Woolcock (1936) gave drawings of the female genital organs (diagrammatic) and of the arrangement of atrial spines. Etymology The specific name victoriae is derived from Victoria, the type- locality of this species. Hosts and localities The type-host of Microcotyle victoriae is the red gurnard perch or jock stewart, Helicolenus percoides The type-host and only recorded host of Microcotyle victoriae is the red gurnard perch or jock stewart, Helicolenus percoides (Sebastidae). The type-locality and only recorded locality is off Australia.

Life and career  Toni Schneiders took up an apprenticeship as a photographer at Menzel Studio in Koblenz in 1935 graduating with a master's certificate in 1938. During the Second World War he was drafted and deployed as war correspondent in France and Italy. After the war, he returned to Koblenz and photographed reportages as well as advertising and landscape photographs. In 1946 he moved to Meersburg, where he opened a photo studio in 1948. In 1949 Schneiders went to Lindau as an independent photojournalist, where he lived and worked with his wife Ingeborg from 1952 until his death in 2006. His archive is housed in the F. C. Gundlach Foundation in Hamburg, his war photography in the German Federal Archive in Koblenz. In 1949 Schneiders co- founded the avant-garde photography group fotoform alongside Siegfried Lauterwasser, Peter Keetman, Wolfgang Reisewitz, Otto Steinert and Ludwig Windsto√üer. With their graphically designed images, the fotoform photographers referred to the photographic trends of the 1920s and early 1930s and drew attention to the creative possibilities of photography. Toni Schneiders was also significantly involved in the development of the so-called subjective photography in the 1950s, which became internationally known through exhibitions and publications under the title Subjektive FotografieOtto Steinert (Ed.): Subjektive Fotografie, Br√ºder Auer Verlag, Bonn 1952 compiled by Otto Steinert. Until his death in 2005, Schneiders was in close contact with Peter Keetman. Toni Schneiders' images are distinguished from those of his companions by their sensitive capturing of people in everyday life. Schneiders worked commercially for publishing houses that created photographic picture books on cities, countries and regions. From 1950 he travelled through Germany, Europe, North Africa and Southeast Asia for these illustrated books.

Education  Jacques-Henri Eyraud comes from a family of teachers. He graduated from Sciences Po Paris (class of 1989), Dauphine (Master 2 in telecommunications and new media management, 1990) and Harvard Business School (Master of Business Administration, 1998). At the age of 22, he did his military service as a press attach√© for the Armed Forces Information and Public Relations Service during the Gulf War.  From Disney to entrepreneurship  He joined Eurodisney as spokesman in 1991, six months before the opening of what was then presented as Europe's \\"greatest project\\". He became the group's communications director. Encouraged by Disney's CEO Steve Burke (now CEO of NBCUniversal), he entered Harvard at the end of 1996 to pursue an MBA. These two years spent on the Boston campus instigated his entrepreneurial spirit. Upon his return, he became Director of New Products at Club Med under the direction of Philippe Bourguignon, one of his Disney mentors. In 2000, he founded Sporever with Patrick Ch√™ne. Two months before the bursting of the internet bubble, he raised $10 million. The company became the European leader in digital sports information, being the first to broadcast live football matches on mobile phones. In 2005, the startup was listed on Alternext and generated 13.5 million euros revenues. In 2009, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Turf √âditions, a media group dedicated to horse racing, for which he undertakes the digital transformation. In 2016, he left his position to devote himself to the Olympique de Marseille.  Olympique de Marseille  = Takeover of the club = During the 2016 summer, when the club was put up for sale by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, Jacques- Henri Eyraud first considered investing personally in the club. Didier Quillot, the new Executive Director of the LFP (Ligue de Football Professionnel), introduced him to Frank McCourt, who had previously expressed an interest in a club acquisition. The two men then decided to join forces. On October 17, 2016, the American businessman bought Olympique de Marseille and Jacques-Henri Eyraud took over the leadership of the club. = Strategy and results = Upon his arrival, he showed high ambition through a project called \\"OM Champion\\" which is based on four axes: sports performance, with the objective of regularly qualifying the club for the UEFA Champions League and making youth training a central point of the club's strategy; fan experience; the club's civic commitment; and finally, its economic sustainability. Rudi Garcia was appointed coach and Andoni Zubizarreta was appointed sports director. A budget of 200 million euros spent over two years was announced to build a competitive team. During the first transfer window, in winter 2017, 44 million euros were spent on 4 players, including 30 million euros only for Dimitri Payet who became the most expensive recruit in the club's history. At the same time, he restructured the club. The voluntary departure plan launched in June 2017 resulted in the end of OM TV in favor of investments in digital content. The OM Foundation was created to promote the club's social commitment. At the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Adidas, the club's equipment supplier since 1974, was replaced by Puma, with whom OM signed a five-year partnership. After several years of negotiations, in July 2018 he announced that he had reached an agreement with AREMA, a Bouygues subsidiary, to become the exclusive manager of the Stade V√©lodrome. OM thus recovered all event activities (seminars, visits, concerts) and allowed itself to freely invest in the stadium (sound, light, etc.). The creation of a museum near the stadium was also planned. He ranked 13th in Ligue 1 when he took over the club, and the team finished 5th in the first year and 4th at the end of the 2017/2018 season. The first European campaign ended in a UEFA Europa League final, which was lost against Atl√©tico Madrid. This was the Club's 5th European final, and the first in 14 years. Attendance records were beaten at the Orange V√©lodrome during the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively against RB Leipzig and RB Salzburg. = Institutional functions = Jacques-Henri Eyraud is a member of the board of directors and of the Bureau of the LFP. On 10 September 2019, Eyraud was appointed as one of the European Club Association Representatives on the Club Competitions Committee in UEFA. = Innovation in football = At the Sport Innovation Summit 2018, he described his vision of the football of the future in a strong impact speech. Looking ahead to 2030, he anticipates the creation of a closed European Super League where the best European teams compete. He also describes the revolution brought about by artificial intelligence in decision-making and depicts the characteristics of the augmented football player of tomorrow.  Recognition  In September 2018, a survey conducted by Capital ranked him 6th in the ranking of the French people's favorite business leaders. He is ahead of Jean-Michel Aulas (13th), to whom he opposes several times, including publicly during the 2017‚Äì18 season.  Areas of interest  Jacques-Henri Eyraud was French junior champion of taekwondo in 1985 and a member of the French team from 1985 to 1987. Since 2007, he has been teaching at Sciences Po Paris, where he teaches the \\"Introduction to Entrepreneurship\\" course. Passionate about music, he quotes a verse from IAM in an interview and claims his taste for his musical idols such as Warren G, The Clash or Rammstein.

Later it transferred to the Territorial Force as a brigade of heavy artillery, and its batteries fought in many of the great battles on the Western Front in World War I. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. One such unit was the 8th Lancashire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) formed in Liverpool on 9 January 1860.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 107‚Äì13.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Lancashire Record Office, Handlist 72. In March the Army List showed it as having been absorbed by the 1st Lancashire AVC (also in Liverpool) but it retained its independence and by June had become part of the 1st Administrative Brigade of Lancashire Artillery Volunteers. By the end of 1860 it was a fully independent unit. In April 1864 it absorbed the 25th (Liverpool) Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps also formed on 9 January 1860 and recruited mainly from the Mersey Steel & Iron Company. The 8th Lancashire AVC's headquarters (HQ) was at the Mersey Steel & Iron Co in 1869, but from 1870 it was in Toxteth Park, Liverpool. By the 1880s it was at Sefton Barracks, Upper Warwick Street, Toxteth.Army List, various dates. Beckett, Appendix VII.Westlake, p. 147. When the Volunteers were consolidated into larger units in 1880 the 8th Lancashire AVC was large enough to retain its identity. In 1882 all the AVCs were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison artillery divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 8th Lancashires became part of the Lancashire Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). In 1902 their titles were changed, the Liverpool unit becoming the 8th Lancashire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers), designated as heavy artillery (ie semi- mobile heavy field artillery, rather than fixed garrison artillery).Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. Territorial Force 4.7-inch gun on 'Woolwich' carriage, ca 1914. When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 8th Lancashire RGA (V) formed the Lancashire Heavy Brigade, RGA of two batteries (initially designated West and East, then from 1910 the 1st and 2nd) and ammunition columns, all at Sefton Barracks.Litchfield, p. 128.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. The Lancashire Brigade was not intended to be a tactical unit: the 1st Lancashire Heavy Bty was attached to the TF's West Lancashire Division,Becke, Pt 2a, p. 37.55 (WL) Division at Long, Long Trail.55 (WL) Division at Regimental Warpath. while the 2nd was attached to the East Lancashire Division.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 135.42 (EL) Division at Long, Long Trail.42 (EL) Division at Regimental Warpath. Each was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns and had its own dedicated ammunition column.Conrad, British Army, 1914. World War I =Mobilisation= The West Lancashire Division had just begun its annual training when war broke out on 4 August 1914 and the units immediately returned to their peacetime HQs to mobilise. The men of the East Lancashire Division similarly gathered, and were billeted close to their HQs. The TF was intended for home service, but on 10 August its units were invited to volunteer for overseas service. The East Lancashire Division, having volunteered en masse, moved into camps for battle training on 20 August. On 15 August 1914, the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 1‚Äì7. On 5 September the East Lancashire Division was ordered to Egypt to relieve the Regular Army garrison there for service on the Western Front. It was the first TF division to go overseas, and embarked on 10 September, leaving behind the 1/2nd Lancashire Heavy Bty, which joined the 2nd East Lancashire Division that was being assembled.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 67‚Äì71.66 (2EL) Division at Long, Long Trail. Similarly, the West Lancashire Division sent most of its infantry units to the Western Front between November 1914 and April 1915, when the 1/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty joined the 2nd West Lancashire Division. =1/1st Lancashire Heavy Battery= The 1/1st Bty joined the 2nd West Lancashire Division (57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division from August 1915) after the last of the 1st Line division was broken up in April 1915. The new division was being assembled and trained round Canterbury, and the battery remained with it until the end of the year. On 28 December the battery moved to Woolwich to prepare for overseas service. It disembarked at Le Havre on 26 January 1916, and joined 29th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) on 1 February.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2.57 (2WL) Division at Long, Long Trail. 4.7-inch gun on the Somme, 1916.

The group's role was to support XIII Corps in its assault on the German lines from Maricourt to beyond Carnoy. The guns were assembled on the reverse slopes of Maricourt Ridge, from which the observation posts (OPs) had excellent views over the long gentle slope to Montauban Ridge, up which the British infantry had to attack. In this sector the British had almost a four-to-one advantage in heavy artillery (one heavy gun or howitzer for every of front) and by 'Z Day' had achieved complete mastery with its counter- battery (CB) fire, which had begun six days earlier and continued during the attack.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 320‚Äì5.Farndale, pp. 147‚Äì8. When the infantry launched their assault on 1 July, XIII Corps had considerable success (certainly compared to most of the rest of the attack) and most of its casualties were caused by machine gun and rifle fire from strongpoints, instead of by artillery, as was usually the case. 30th Division on the right reached both its first and second objectives (Montauban), but could not go further, because the neighbouring 18th Division was held up. 18th Division, however did achieve all its objectives by 16.00. The sector was reported to be eerily quiet by the late afternoon, with only a single German 5.9-inch gun shelling Montauban Alley at extreme range, slowly and inaccurately. Unfortunately, much less success had been achieved on the rest of the front and the Somme Offensive ground on until November 1916..Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 325‚Äì45. The obsolescent 4.7-inch guns were progressively replaced in the BEF by 60-pounders during 1916. In December 1916 the WO decided that all heavy batteries should be composed of six guns and 1/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty was brought up to that strength on 12 February 1917 when it was joined by a section of 193rd Hvy Bty (newly arrived in France and immediately broken up).Farndale, Annex E. Vimy A battery of 60-pounders deployed during the Battles of Vimy and Arras, 1917. 1/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty had been transferred to 57th HAG on 7 December 1916. It rejoined 29th HAG when it was brought up to six guns, and then on 14 March transferred to 84th HAG with First Army further north, which it joined a week later.. First Army was preparing for participation in the Arras Offensive, and 84th HAG was assigned to I Corps for the attack on Vimy Ridge on 9 April. The concentration of heavy guns was one for every of front. The artillery preparation began on 20 March, with the batteries of 84th HAG firing from around Bois de Bouvigny on the north flank of the attack, from where they could virtually enfilade the German lines in support of I Corps. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised CB fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the 60-pounders switched to 'searching' fire on the German rear areas to catch machine gunners and moving infantry. When the British infantry reached their Phase 2 objective (the Blue Line) the field guns would move forward and the 60-pounders move up to occupy their vacated positions. The attack went in on 9 April with I Corps and Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge while Third Army attacked further south near Arras. The only hold-up on 9 April was at Hill 145, near the north end of the Canadian attack, and the capture of this position was completed the next day. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. Later war On 15 May, 1/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty transferred to 15th HAG, quickly moving on to 98th HAG on 28 May, with which it stayed while First Army carried out a number of operations round Oppy Wood and Hill 70. On 4 September it moved to 87th HAG, then on 25 October to 46th HAG with Second Army, which was engaged in the final actions of the Battle of Passchendaele.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7. A 60-pounder moving up during the Hundred Days Offensive, 1918. Second Army HQ was sent to the Italian Front at the end of 1917, and Fourth Army took over the Ypres Salient. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 the HAGs were converted into permanent RGA brigades, with 46th becoming a 'Mobile' brigade of 60-pounders and 6-inch howitzers. Apart from a temporary attachment to 79th HAG from 24 December to 28 January 1918, 1/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty remained with 46th Bde until the end of the war.Farndale, Annex E.Farndale, Annex M. Fourth Army was engaged in the second phase of the German Spring Offensive in April 1918 (the Battle of the Lys). 46th (Mobile) Bde moved to First Army on 1 May. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with First Army attacking at Arras and the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line in late August and early September. On 2 October, 46th (Mobile) Bde transferred to Fifth Army, which launched its final advance that day, liberating Lille on 17 October ad closing up to the Scheldt. By the Armistice with Germany, Fifth Army was across the Dendre.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114‚Äì20.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop,p. 404. =1/2nd Lancashire Heavy Battery= After the East Lancashire Division departed for Egypt, 1/2nd Hvy Bty was attached to the 2nd Line division (later 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division), but did not fully join it in Kent until September 1915 after the Right Section of the battery returned from detachment at Sunderland. It left the division on 5 January 1916 and went to Woolwich to mobilise. It disembarked with its 4.7-inch guns at Le Havre on 9 February 1916 and joined 16th HAG. It moved rapidly between HAGs: to 29th on 3 March and 21st on 12 March before joining 18th on 14 May. This HAG was with Second Army HQ in the Ypres Salient, but on 10 September it reinforced Fourth Army HQ for the later battles of the Somme Offensive. The battery joined 62nd HAG on 2 December. On 12 February 1917 it was made up to six guns when it was joined by a section from 118th Hvy Bty, a Regular battery that had been in France since 1914.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 92‚Äì4. The enlarged battery then joined 14th and then 23rd HAG, shortly before they moved to Fifth Army. However, 1/2nd Lancashire Hvy Bty returned to 29th HAG on 28 March and moved with it to First Army on 14 April, though it supported XVII Corps of Third Amy in the success at Arras on 9 April 1917.Farndale, Western Front, p. 169. Apart from a brief period with 99th HAG, the battery remained with 29th HAG, transferring with it to Second Army in July, and then changing to 65th HAG. Second Army played a subsidiary role in the Third Ypres Offensive during August. On 5 September the battery moved to 39th HAG with Third Army, then 17th HAG on 23 October. Cambrai The battery came under the command of 50th HAG on 16 November, in time for Third Army's great tank attack on 20 November (the Battle of Cambrai). 50th HAG was assigned to III Corps, which used its 'heavies' to support individual attacking divisions as well as for CB fire. Efficient flash spotting and sound ranging ensured 90 per cent accuracy of the CB fire, and the combination of tanks and artillery on III Corps' front overwhelmed the Hindenburg Line defences. However, getting the batteries forward to support follow-up attacks on succeeding days proved difficult, and the attacks fell short of a complete breakthrough.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì8.Farndale, pp. 221‚Äì30. When the German counter-attacks broke through on 30 November, the battery prepared for withdrawal before 10.00, calling up the horse teams from the wagon lines. The situation seemed to improve so the guns opened fire again and continued in action on the Quentin ridge until the last moment. Heavy shelling had rendered two 'hopelessly out of action' and damaged the others. They withdrew to Metz as the Germans overran the position. One gun situated in a sunken road south of Marcoing was damaged by shellfire and had to be abandoned as the rest got away.Miles, 1917, Vol III, pp. 187, 211. During the winter, 1/2nd Lancashire Hvy Bty switched to 86th HAG on 14 December, 57th HAG on 17 December, and finally returned to 21st HAG with Fifth Army on 27 December, with which it stayed for the rest of the war. On 1 February 1918, 21st HAG became 21st (Mobile) Brigade, RGA. A 60-pounder battery firing in the open during the German Spring Offensive, 1918. Spring Offensive The Germans launched their Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918, primarily against Fifth Army. By 28 March, XIX Corps (all that remained effective from Fifth Army) was struggling to maintain a link between Third Army and VI French Corps. There was bitter fighting between the Rivers Avre and Somme, during which the French retired, exposing the British right flank and forcing a British retirement late in the day. The battery had its 60-pounders in action near Warfus√©e as the British infantry fell back at 19.30, closely pursued by the Germans, who engaged the gun positions with machine guns from a flank. Part of the battery was withdrawn but one section could not get its horse teams up under the heavy fire. The section commander, Lt N. Roberts, with some gunners manhandled some ammunition wagons to provide flank protection against the fire, and then got his teams up and 'snatched his two heavies from under the very noses of the enemy, a most gallant and courageous act'.Farndale, pp. 274‚Äì5. Fifth Army was reconstituted as Fourth Army at the beginning of April, and 21st (Mobile) Bde remained with it until the Armistice, through the later phases of the Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive (see above). =2/1st Lancashire Heavy Battery= The 2/1st Bty trained at Blackpool until 26 November 1915, when it joined 57th Division at Canterbury (just before the 1st Line battery left for France). It received four 4.7-inch guns from Southampton on 29 December. 57th Division formed part of Second Army (Home Forces) of Central Force, and was quartered around Canterbury on home defence duties until July 1916 when it transferred to the Emergency Reserves in Aldershot Command. However, 2/1st Hvy Bty left the division and went to France independently. It disembarked at Le Havre on 1 July and on 4 July joined 'Loring's Group' with II ANZAC Corps. Fromelles The battery was thrown straight into supporting a disastrous diversionary attack at Fromelles made by II ANZAC Corps with raw troops (the Official History emphasises the inexperience of the heavy artillery available for this operation, some of whom 'had never fired in France'). The heavy artillery began registering their targets and firing a slow bombardment on 16 July, then the following day a special programme began, seven hours before the infantry was due to go 'over the top'. Bad weather caused a two-day postponement of the attack. Although the bombardment appeared to have been effective, when the infantry attacked on 19 July they found much of the German parapet and barbed wire undamaged. Some parties managed to penetrate the German position, but all gains had been lost by the following morning.Miles, pp. 121‚Äì34. The battery transferred to 52nd HAG with Second Army on 4 August and remained with it in the Ypres Salient until the end of the year. On 2 October 1916 the battery was made up to six guns by the addition of a section from 175th Hvy Bty just arrived from England. Messines 52nd HAG moved to Fourth Army in December 1916, but 2/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty remained behind, serving with Second Army Artillery School from 13 January to 19 February 1917. It then moved to VIII Corps Heavy Artillery, joining 71st HAG. Second Army's artillery was involved in a complex fireplan preceding the Battle of Messines, starting on 21 May, and increasing to eight days of intensive fire from 31 May, with over 200 German battery positions being intensively shelled on 5 and 6 June, continuing after the attack commenced. The artillery effect was as great as the huge mines that were fired under the German front line at Zero hour on 7 June, and the attack was an outstanding success.Edmonds, 1917, Vol I, pp. 41‚Äì9.Farndale, pp. 184‚Äì91. Moving a 60-pounder in mud. The battery moved to Fifth Army after Messines, first with 85th HAG, then to 92nd HAG on 4 July, in time to be involved in the artillery preparation for the Third Ypres Offensive. This began on 16 July, but did not have the advantages of Messines: the Ypres salient was overlooked, and the guns suffered badly from German CB fire. The opening attack on 1 August was only a partial success, and the offensive quickly bogged down as the weather broke. 2/1st Lancashire Hvy Bty was pulled out of the Salient on 21 September when it transferred to 21st HAG with Third Army.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, p. 135.Farndale, pp. 195‚Äì208. The battery remained with Third Army for the rest of the year, including the Cambrai battles, during which it transferred to 78th HAG on 21 November, and finally transferred to 17th HAG on 25 December. 17th HAG became 17th (Mixed) Bde, RGA, in February 1918, and fought with Third Army until the Armistice. =2/2nd Lancashire Heavy Battery= The 2/2nd Hvy Bty joined 66th (2nd East Lancs) Division after it concentrated for home defence with Second Army, Central Force, in Kent and Sussex in August 1915. The battery was stationed at Plaw Hatch on the edge of Ashdown Forest. It was not until 7 January 1916 that the battery received four worn-out 4.7-inch guns for practising gunlaying drill. In 1916 the division came under Southern Army (Home Forces) and moved to the East Coast defences accompanied by 2/1st and 2/2nd London Hvy Batteries, while 2/2nd Lancashire Hvy Bty transferred to 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 75‚Äì82. 67th Division was based in Kent, and from September 1916 the battery was at Upstreet Camp and at Minster. When 67th Division was reorganised as a training formation after August 1917, the battery came under the command of Kent Force, Eastern Command. Towards the end of the war, while still at Minster, the battery was attached to the Cyclist Division. It remained on home defence until demobilisation.67 (2HC) Division at Long, Long Trail. Postwar The units of the Lancashire Heavy Brigade, RGA, were placed in suspended animation when they were demobilised in 1919. After the TF was re-established after the war, the two batteries of the brigade were combined with the two prewar batteries of the Liverpool-based 4th West Lancashire (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, to form the 4th West Lancashire Medium Brigade, RGA, consisting of one battery of 60-pdrs and three of 6-inch howitzers. A former officer of the 4th West Lancs was authorised to raise this unit on 21 May 1920 at his unit's drill hall at The Grange, Edge Lane, Liverpool. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year, the brigade was redesignated 59th (4th West Lancs) Medium Brigade, RGA (TA) (the former 4th West Lancs fought hard to get their 'Old Fourth' number included in the title). The brigade went on to win the prestigious King's Cup on two occasions in the 1930s, and spun off three medium regiments that fought with distinction at Dunkirk, Crete, East Africa, Tobruk and North West Europe during World War II.Anon, History, pp. 48‚Äì51. Insignia The Lancashire AVCs all seem to have worn the same badge on the 'bomb'-shaped busby plume holder and waistbelt clasp: this consisted of a cannon with a pile of cannonballs to the left and a Lancashire rose above, surrounded by a circle bearing the words 'LANCASHIRE VOLUNTEER ARTILLERY' (see above).

Form The novel is a short prose narrative in ten chapters, each of which includes a full-page monochrome illustration by Sigmundur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞ √ûorgeirsson and a number of smaller illustrations of different, sometimes outlandish, kinds of underpants. Chapters begin with a subheading often including pants-related puns on well known Icelandic proverbs and phrases, such as 'blindur er br√≥karlaus ma√∞ur' ('a trouserless person is blind') for blindur er b√≥klaus ma√∞ur ('a bookless person is blind'). Summary The protagonists are Gutti, the most diligent child in his school, and √ìl√≠na, the most troublesome. Near the beginning of the story, Gutti learns that the underpants factory that dominates his neighbourhood has just been closed by the authorities. After school, he goes to the home of his grandmother, who works in the factory, expecting to find her there. She does not return, but √ìl√≠na finds Gutti there and convinces him to investigate the factory. Climbing in through an open window, the duo explore forgotten sections of the building, discovering a large colony of rabbits in a fabric store, a dysfunctional robot called Bl√∫nduRASS 3000, a community of anarchist teenagers revelling in the lack of a mobile phone signal, and a group of partying retirees hiding in the factory to avoid entering retirement homes. These last direct Gutti to his missing grandmother, who turns out secretly to have been running the factory single- handed since most human employees were replaced by machines, and thus to have been sheltering the various misfits inhabiting the factory. Gutti learns that, no longer able to keep pace with the global underpants market, she has been unable to sustain the business, and that the factory is about to be demolished. He rushes out to reason with the demolition crew, eventually forestalling their activities by slashing the tyres of one of their machines. The story closes with a retrospective account of how Gutti, his grandmother, and √ìl√≠na succeed in winning official approval to turn the factory into a heritage and cultural centre called Rumpurinn.

The gyri are the superior occipital gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus, and the inferior occipital gyrus, and these are also known as the occipital face area. The superior and inferior occipital sulci separates the three occipital gyri. The intraoccipital sulcus, also known as the superior occipital sulcus, stems from the intraparietal sulcus and continues until the sulcus reaches the transverse occipital sulcus, separating the superior occipital gyrus from the middle occipital gyrus. The transverse occipital sulcus comes down along the lateral occipital surface or the inferior occipital sulcus.  Structural anatomy  Diagram of gyri of brain viewed on lateral hemisphere. Occipital gyri shown lower right. The border between the occipital lobe and the parietal and temporal lobes is characterized by different gyri: the superior occipital gyrus (also known as gyrus occipitalis superior), middle occipital gyrus (or gyrus occipitalis medius), inferior occipital gyrus (or gyrus occipitalis inferior), and descending occipital gyrus (gyrus occipitalis descendens).  Function  The occipital complex is primarily responsible for object recognition, including the functional properties and our perception of said objects. The middle occipital gyrus (MOG) was observed in a study of the early blind, which showed that it was activated more during spatial than nonspatial tactile and auditory tasks. Early blind people have an occipital cortex that is incorporates more senses than people with standard vision, but the MOG still keeps its functional role in processing space around a person. The lingual gyrus (also known as medial occipitotemporal gyrus) has been studied and found to be included in processing overall shapes, rather than the individual components that make up a shape. This shows that the lingual gyrus is active during visual processing. The inferior occipital gyrus has been found to be related to the visual function of processing faces. The IOG is connected to the amygdala via white matter connectivity. This allows the IOG to form a network for facial recognition with the amygdala.  Development  The occipital lobe becomes distinct at 18 weeks gestation, but the gyri are not clear until many weeks later. During development, the occipital lobe develops a lingual gyrus at 27 weeks of gestation. Secondary gyri develop by 30 weeks, and tertiary gyri develop during 40 to 42 weeks of gestation. The superior and inferior occipital gyri develop at the same time, usually shown somewhere between week 24 and 27 in brain development. Due to the unclear distinction in early neuroscience research as to whether there are two or three occipital gyri, there is not any data on when the middle occipital gyrus starts its formation, but it is likely at the same time.

Early life and education  Bunny Michael was raised in Dallas, Texas. They are the middle of three children born to a second-generation Mexican American father and a Samoan mother. They were raised in an affluent suburb. Michael attended Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. They realized they were queer at the age of fifteen and stated that coming out to their family was a difficult process. Michael briefly moved in with their first girlfriend's family. They have since reconciled with their family. Michael graduated from Marymount Manhattan College.  Career  Michael is a visual artist, musician, and rapper whose work often examines the relationship between the masculine and feminine, the body and the soul, and the self and higher self. After graduating from college, they shared their music through Myspace. Michael was the vocalist performing by the name Bunny Rabbit with producer Black Cracker. It is described by HuffPost as an \\"eponymous experimental rap collaboration.\\" Bunny Rabbit toured with CocoRosie and gained praise from New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones who stated in 2007, \\"I am fond of the deeply odd, occasionally obscene art rap of Bunny Rabbit.\\" Michael garnered a large fan base through Myspace which allowed them to book their own U.S. tour. Michael was working as a waiter in 2017. In 2018, Michael went on tour in Europe with Fever Ray. They are known for their \\"Me and My Higher Self\\" memes on Instagram which started when Michael was undergoing a major spiritual transformation of their own. This project is aimed at increasing self-love, and much like Michael's music and visual art, also explores the multiplicities within the self. Remezcla reports that Michael is a \\"queer multimedia artist...[who] utilizes music, art videos, and memes as their mediums to explore themes of self love and acceptance, spirituality, and sexuality in a time when our 'deepest truths are being revealed'.\\" Michael is the host of ‚ÄúBroadly Hotline,‚Äù a web series on Broadly.

Filon studied in Rovigo before being summoned to Milan for mandated service in the armed forces towards the close of World War I but following it was able to resume his studies in Bassano del Grappa. He was ordained to the priesthood and spent a brief respite in Slovenia due to a disease he was suffering from. He remained for most of his time as a friar listening to confessions in Udine but died in 1948 in Lourdes while on a pilgrimage. Filon's cause for beatification launched in the 1980s and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue enabled for Pope Francis to name him as Venerable on 16 June 2017. Life Beniamino Filon was born in Balduina di San Urbano on 2 August 1900 as the eighth of ten children to the modest farmers Giacomo Filon (d. 11 March 1924) and Giuseppina Marin (d. 31 July 1932) who were married in Padua on 24 March 1887. He received baptism on 5 August 1900 from Father Cristiano Sartori with the names Beniamino Angelo; his godparents were Angelo Bertoet and Maddalena Sartori. On 18 April 1910 he received his Confirmation from the Bishop of Padua Luigi Pellizzo and then his First Communion on 2 April 1911 in his hometown from Father Eugenio Bau. Filon attended school from 1906 until 1909 and then attended school in Lendinara from 1910 until 1914. It was in Lendinara that he had his first encounters with friars from the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin; he became impressed with their order and so began visiting them and decided that he wished to enter their order which he did on 13 October 1917 with the beginning of his ecclesial studies in Rovigo. On 20 March 1918 he was called to Milan for mandated service with the armed forces due to World War I. He remained in the armed forces for his service until 1921. He began his novitiate in Bassano del Grappa on 28 September 1922 at which point he was vested in the Franciscan habit and assumed his religious name. He made his initial profession into the order on 29 September 1923. Filon's studies in Thiene in Vicenza were interrupted on 3 July 1924 when he was transferred for his education at Santissimo Redentore in Venice. During his theological studies around 1925 he began feeling the effects of the disease encephalitis lethargica that led to doubts for his proceeding towards ordination. His superiors feared his premature death and so decided to dispense him from the final part of his theological formation so that he could be ordained but he did make his solemn profession on 8 December 1926. He received his ordination to the priesthood from the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice Pietro La Fontaine in the church of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on 21 July 1929. He celebrated his first Mass in his hometown on 4 August 1929. Filon's suffering increased at a gradual rate but he offered his suffering for the salvation of souls and the sanctification of priests. He spent a brief respite in Koper in Slovenia and then on 28 November 1931 arrived in Udine where he would live but first underwent a thorough examination. The doctors diagnosed him with postencephalitic parkinsonism on 29 September 1932. His cell was positioned on the first floor to act as a confessional where he would hear penitents due to his disease. On 15 September 1941 he made a pilgrimage to Loreto and then made another one there in 1946. Filon's renown in the confessional became great to the point that people called him \\"santo confessore\\". There were some penitents that often said that Filon could mention their faults to them before having the chance to speak with people comparing it to Padre Pio's reading of hearts. Monsignor Pietro Baldassi - a priest who served the Unione Nazionale Italiana Transporto Ammalati a Lourdes Santuari Internazionali - knew just how ill Filon was and so invited him to make a pilgrimage to Lourdes. He left on 19 July 1948 (he celebrated his final Mass that morning) via train reaching Lourdes but could not proceed from there to the grotto as he had hoped. The next evening his condition worsened. He experienced great pain at 11:00pm on 21 July with his breathing becoming labored. He lost consciousness and woke sometime later and so received the Anointing of the Sick when the pain continued but died just moments later while singing the Magnificat. His funeral was held on 23 July and he was buried in a wooden coffin. His remains were interred in Lourdes but on 15 October 1949 his remains were exhumed to be placed in another grave in a coffin of oak lined with zinc and exhumed once more on 9 June 1997. Beatification process The beatification process launched on 15 October 1982 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to launching the cause) decree thus titling him as a Servant of God. The cognitional process to investigate Filon and his reputation for holiness opened on 25 February 1984 and was concluded later on 18 November 1989. The C.C.S. validated this process on 11 March 1994 as having complied with their regulations for conducting causes. The postulation submitted the Positio dossier on 21 July 2001 to the C.C.S. for further assessment. Nine theologians approved the dossier on 13 October 2016 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. some months later. Pope Francis named Filon as being Venerable on 16 June 2017 upon confirming that the late friar had lived a life of heroic virtue. Filon's beatification depends upon the confirmation of a miracle that in most cases is a healing that science and medicine cannot explain. The diocesan investigation for such a case was called for in September 2016 and was launched on 11 February 2017. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni.

She holds the Nuffield Chair of Anaesthetic Science and is the Head of Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford. She is a co-founder of the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) and is its former director. Her research is focused on the neuroscience of pain, specifically pain perception and analgesia, which she studies using neuroimaging tools. She is the Warden of Merton College, Oxford. Early life and education Tracey was born at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. She completed her undergraduate and DPhil, supervised by Sir George Radda, in biochemistry at Merton College, at the University of Oxford. Academic career Tracey moved to the Harvard Medical School for a post-doctoral position, before returning to Oxford in 1996. After her return she helped found the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB). She would serve as its director from 2005 until 2015. In 2001 she got a lectureship, before becoming a professor in 2005, both at the university of Oxford. In October 2016 she became the Head of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences. In October 2017, Tracey was announced as the next Warden of Merton College, Oxford, in succession to Sir Martin Taylor. She took up the appointment in October 2019, becoming the college's 51st warden. She is the second female warden: Dame Jessica Rawson was warden from 1994 to 2010. = Research = One of the major findings from Tracey's work is the cerebral signature for pain perception, the representation of pain in the brain. In an early study she identifies the anterior insula and the prefrontal cortex to be involved in the anticipation of pain. Together with one of her postdoctoral fellows, she later identified one particular region of the brain that is pain- specific, the dorsal posterior insula. More recently she has been interested in the how states of consciousness are altered by using anaesthetics. In a study they determined how participants responded to stimuli, while measuring their brain activity using EEG and fMRI. They found common patterns of brain activity when their participants lost consciousness due to anaesthetics.  Public engagement  Tracey has been a guest on a number of podcasts and radio programmes. She is a strong advocate for women in science. She was featured in the University of Oxford Diversity Projects Women in Science interviews. Personal life Tracey is married and has three children.

The first show was broadcast in 1962 and have since then existed in many iterations. The latest iteration started in August 2016 with Kristian Luuk as host.  History  = 1962 - 1981 = Fr√•ga Lund was first broadcast in the fall of 1962. It was then Malm√∂'s foremost contribution to Swedish television since Bialitt ended the year before. The first show was recorded in a studio on Baltzarsgatan (in Malm√∂, not Lund) and the expert panel consisted of: * Jan- √ñjvind Swahn, host of Fr√•ga Lund (also docent, later professor of ethnology) * Gerhard Bendz, docent, later professor of classical languages) * Sten von Friesen, professor of physics * David H. Ingvar, docent, later professor of neurology * Carl H. Lindroth, professor of entomology * J√∂rgen Weibull, docent, later professor of history Later the show would be actually recorded in Lund, for example from Akademiska F√∂reningen and Stadshallen. During the spring of 1979 one episode was recorded in Helsinki. The show would to a large extent be associated with Jan-√ñjvind Swahn who was the host for almost two decades. Except for a few episodes that was hosted by the university's rector magnificus Philip Sandblom. The last with Jan-√ñjvind Swahn as host was the Easter special that was broadcast April 18, 1981. After that the show was dropped. = 1993 - 2000 = After about a decade the show returned on February 27, 1993. This new version was broadcast from Grand Hotel in Lund and was hosted by Bertil Svensson, who also was the producer of the earlier incarnation. The new version had three seasons, whereof the latter two would be broadcast during late fall so that the last episode could be watched during the Christmas holiday. After two special episodes shown at the sheer Thursday and Pentecost 1996, the show was dropped. An additional season was made in year 2000 with Gunnel Werner as host. This version was a live broadcast direct from Malm√∂ during the Saturday afternoons during both the spring and fall. It was also broadcast live on internet with a web-exclusive part after the TV- portion had ended. = 2016 - Present = During the fall of 2016 a new show was created bearing the name Fr√•ga Lund. This new version had many similarities to the older iterations, but tried this time to reach a broader audience. It was recorded at Sparbanken Sk√•ne Arena in Lund with Kristian Luuk as host. The show was recorded infron of a live audience on the 3, 6, 7, and 8 June. It was produced by the production company Nexiko for Sveriges Television. The panel, not all being from Lund, consists mostly of: * Henrik Widegren, Doctor of Medicine. * Jessica Abbott, evolutionary biologist. * Gunnar Wetterberg, historian and honorary doctor. * Gabriella Stenberg Wieser, space physicist at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna. * Armita Golkar, Doctor of Psychology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.  Reception  The show got both negative and positive critic by reviewers. Three academics with a past at Lund University wrote a text that was critic to the show and told that the original concept of Fr√•ga Lund was to help the university to fulfill its Third Task, namely to spread its knowledge to the common Swede. In a radio interview the authors added that the new format of the show banalised the concept of knowledged and underestimated the audience's ability to understand complex scientific concepts with the help of researchers and academics. SVT's program purchaser answered that the program had been well received, even by the audience. That the happy address with a twinkle in the eye and with variety made the program both attractive and reached a wide audience. That questions that sounds trivial can produce intricate answers. The program manager dismissed the critique which he ment \\"often had been as simplistic and superficial as the program itself was accused of being\\", with that program had many viewers. He also mention that he is surprised that 1.1 million viewers (about 11 percent of the then current Swedish population) choose a program where five intelligent academics explained and discuss contemporary research.  Rewards  On January 2, 2019 the show was awarded with Educator of the Year 2018 by The Swedish Skeptics' Association. Their motivation was: > \\"The program is awarded this award because with the help of researchers and > other experts in different subject areas in an easily accessible way > answering viewer's questions about research and science. 'Fr√•ga Lund' > capture many viewers of all ages who might not otherwise have been > interested in science and research.

She was included as a member of the \\"C√≠rculo Literario\\" in 1887 and of the \\"Ateneo de Lima\\" in 1891. She married the Colombian writer El√≠as de Losada Pliss√© in 1893, and they settled in New York City. Shortly after, she became a widow (1896). She retired back to her hometown where she dedicated herself to her son's education. Among her work is \\"La Felicidad\\" (1887); \\"La literatura en la mujer\\" (1891); \\"Ensayos literarios\\" (1893); \\"El voto\\" (1923), short novel; \\"Poes√≠as\\" (1928); \\"La madre Espinach, vidente y profetisa\\" (1933 y 1950); \\"Tragedia in√©dita\\" (1948); and \\"El jab√≥n de hiel\\" (1949), which were stories inspired by traditions and legends of her hometown. In 1952 she wrote'Los Barz√∫as\\" which was a novel.  Life  Amalia Natividad de las Mercedes Puga, was born in Cajamarca on 8 September 1866 to Jos√© Mercedes Puga y Valera and Carolina Puga Ch√°varri. During the War of the Pacific in April 1879, her father entered military service. In 1885, after a long period of rebellion against Miguel Iglesias, he was triumphantly entering Huamachuco, when he was shot and killed. Amalia was then still a teenager. Her distress over this first great tragedy was reflected in her essay \\"La Memoria\\" (1888) and in the poems \\"Gotas de Ac√≠bar\\" (1888) and \\"Remembranzas\\" (1893). Her mother was educated in the \\"Beaterio de las Shocllas\\", where she would later send Amalia. This bestowed on her faith and a respect for the rigid moral principles of Cajamarca society. She belonged to one of the families whose power is represented by the Spaniards and their descendants. They owned land, mines, commerce, and had access to secondary and higher education. There are marked socio-economic differences, a situation that was clearly noted in Amalia's writing. Amalia made her debut as a writer in 1887, before she turned twenty one years old. She published in Lima a short article called \\"La felicidad\\" (Happiness). She also wrote for \\"El Per√∫ Ilustrado\\" and the next year for \\"El √Ålbum de Trujillo\\". In 1890 she started writing for the \\"Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York\\" and the director of the periodical - El√≠as de Losada y Pliss√© - fell in love with her. In 1891 she was admitted in the \\"Ateneo de Lima\\" with a successful dissertation on \\"La Literatura en la Mujer\\" (Literature in Women). In 1891 the \\"Sociedad Amantes del Progreso de Cajamarca\\" admitted her unanimously as an honorary member. In 1892 she won a contest promoted by Lima's Provincial Council with her poem \\"El Descubrimiento\\" (The discovery). In 1893 she married Enrique de Losada y Pliss√© and they moved to New York City. Amalia left writing to one side and barely published anything. It is a literary silence reflected in the sonnet \\"Flujo y Reflujo\\". Her only child, Crist√≥bal de Losada y Puga, was born in 1894; she dedicated to him, \\"A mi hijo en su infancia\\", and the sonnet \\"√çntimo\\", in which she offers her maternity. He later became a noted mathematician. Her writing, just like the one of other authors of progressive ideology such as Mercedes Cabello and Clorinda Matto, lacks historic and political elements since none of these women see clearly their participation in the socio-political sphere. They consider social, military and political events as alien to the female essence (maternity). By the time she's 30 she was widowed and with a child; she then decided to return to Cajamarca and, after a period of spiritual healing, she picked up writing again. In 1924, she wrote \\"Himno\\"; in 1925, Cajamarca's Provincial Council renamed Callao street with her name; in 1927 the \\"Editorial Cervantes\\" from Barcelona published her poems in the presentation of American women poets. She spent the last forty years of her life in Lima, troubled by the 1930s coup conducted by S√°nchez Cerro, and the political prosecution of the new ideologists such as V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre and Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui. Amalia, who knew these type of situations, limited herself to writing exclusively about Cajamarca and is known as \\"La Puguita\\". In 1933 she published \\"La Madre Espinach, vidente y profetisa\\", which retakes the historical storytelling of Cajamarca. In 1937, she created and led the \\"Liga Femenil Pro-Di√≥cesis de Cajamarca\\", and a year later the \\"Sociedad Obras de Vocaciones Sacerdotales de Cajamarca\\". The nine stories presented in her book \\"Tragedia In√©dita\\" (1948) are about Cajamarca; \\"El jab√≥n de hiel\\" (1949), is a compilation of 20 more stories previously published by periodicals in Lima such as \\"El Social\\", \\"El Renacimiento\\", \\"Correo de la Educaci√≥n\\" and \\"La Uni√≥n de Pacasmayo\\", and the novel \\"Los Barz√∫as\\" (1952). In 1960 the Government awarded her the Order of the Sun of Peru and her son Cristobal died, which plunged her into such deep pain that she completely abandoned writing. She died three years later.

At the time of his death in 1980, he was one of only two surviving students of Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. He spent fifty-six years of his career extending Pavlov's seminal experimental research on classical conditioning. He is also recognized for his research in psychophysiology. Early life and education Gantt was born on October 24, 1892 on the Rock Cliff estate in Wingina, Virginia. His father was a businessman and his mother was college-educated. Gantt's father died when he was three years old. When Gantt was twelve years old, his mother enrolled him in the Miller School in Charlottesville, Virginia, which he attended on a scholarship. In 1913, he enrolled at the University of North Carolina, from which he received his B.S. degree in 1917. He then attended the University of Virginia, from which he received his M.D. in 1920. Academic career In 1922, Gantt began working for the American Relief Administration in Petrograd, Russia, where he studied the health effects of famine and war. In October of that year, Gantt was introduced to Ivan Pavlov by Nicholai Zelheim, one of Pavlov's Russian colleagues. Gantt then completed a one-year residency at University College Medical School, where he studied liver pathology with John William McNee. In 1925, he returned to Russia to work with Pavlov in his laboratory in the Institute of Experimental Medicine. In 1929, Gantt founded the Pavlovian Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University's Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic, where John Dewey played a major role in helping him to get a faculty position. He was director of the Pavlovian Laboratory at Johns Hopkins from 1930 to 1964. In 1948, he and William G. Reese founded the Psychological Research Laboratory at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Perry Point, Maryland. In 1955, Gantt founded the Pavlovian Society, of which he served as president from then until 1965. He went on to found the society's journal, Conditional Reflex, in 1965. He insisted on giving the journal this name because the term \\"conditional\\" preserves the fact that the reflex, rather than being fixed, is dependent on a stimulus and subject to change. He was the founding editor-in-chief of Conditional Reflex (later renamed the Pavlovian Journal of Biological Science) from 1966 to 1978. Honors and awards Gantt was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1934. He received the Lasker Award in 1946 and the American Heart Association Award in 1950. He was nominated for (but did not win) a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1970, and received the Gold Medal Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry in 1972. In 1975, he received both the van Giesen Award from the New York Psychiatric Institute and the Purkinje Medical Society Award. Personal life and death Gantt married Mary Gould Richardson on June 23, 1934. They remained married until she died of cancer on July 17, 1964. They had a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Emily. Gantt died on February 26, 1980 in Baltimore, Maryland, after a short illness. He is buried at Rock Cliff in Wingina, Virginia, the same property on which he was born. This property met criterion B to be added to the National Register of Historic Places because Gantt was born there, and lived there until 1910; it also met criterion C because it is associated with his medical career.

He also worked, between 1897 and 1916, as a senior officer in the Prussian Ministry for Religion, Education and Medical affairs.  Biography  Ludwig Hermann Alexander Elster was born in Frankfurt am Main. Carl Elster (1826-1902), his father, came from a Braunschweig family and was the son of a master baker: he had worked as a Hanoverian diplomat, and represented Hanover at the Frankfurt Bundesversammlung (literally, \\"... Federal Convention\\"). After his sons were born Carl Elster moved into the private sector in 1866, when he became chairman of the Leipzig-based \\"Teutonia\\" Insurance business. Ludwig Elster's mother, born Amalie Nolte (1829-1890), was a daughter of the head of the Hanoverian libraries service. As a small boy he was privately tutored in Berlin. Later, like his younger brother Ernst Elster (1860-1940), he attended the prestigious St. Thomas' [secondary] School in Leipzig. Passing the Reifepr√ºfung (exam) in 1875 opened the way to university-level education. He studied Jurisprudence and Economics at G√∂ttingen, Leipzig and Jena. It was at Jena, supervised by the traditionalist economist Bruno Hildebrand, that Ludwig Elster received his doctorate in 1878. That year he became a member of the Prussian civil service when he joined the City of Berlin Statistical Office as a volunteer, while continuing to pursue his university studies. Encouraged and mentored in his further studies by Johannes Conrad, Elster received his habilitation (higher degree) in Economics from the University of Halle, an hour's train ride to the south-west of the Prussian capital. In 1881 Ludwig Elster married Helene Th√∂le at Osnabr√ºck. Elster came from a Protestant family while the Th√∂les were a catholic family, but there is nothing in the sources consulted to suggest that this became an issue. The bride's father, August Wilheln Hermann Heinrich Th√∂le, was a physician. The marriage between Ludwig and Helen Elster produced five recorded children - two sons and three daughters. After three years as a junior university-level tutor, Elster's career took off in 1883 after he was offered a lectureship with the so-called Technical University at Aachen. Despite his relative youth, the post came with a junior professorship. Nevertheless, before the year was finished he had moved on again, this time to the opposite side of the country. By the end of 1883 he had accepted a professorship at K√∂nigsberg. He stayed here till 1887, but there are nevertheless suggestions that the East Prussian academic establishment undervalued his contribution.Christian Tilitzki: Die Albertus-Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg: Ihre Geschichte von der Reichsgr√ºndung bis zum Untergang der Provinz Ostpreu√üen (1871‚Äì1945). vol 1: 1871‚Äì1918. Berlin/Boston 2012, , p. 101. While still at K√∂nigsberg he founded the \\"Staatswissenschaftliche Studien\\" series of academic studies. Some of the contributions came from his own students. In 1887 Elster accepted an invitation to move to Breslau. He took a full professorship and a teaching chair in National√∂konomie (very loosely, \\"applied political micro-economics\\"), which he would occupy for the next ten years. Following the promotion within the ministry of Friedrich Althoff, Ludwig Elster succeeded him in 1897 as \\"Vortragender Rat\\" (loosely, \\"presiding councillor\\") in the Prussian Ministry for Religion, Education and Medical affairs. The role, which had no very precise equivalent in the Anglo- American national governance structure, gave him hands-on oversight responsibilities across the entire Prussian higher education network. Between 1897 and 1907 his predecessor, now serving as \\"Ministerial Director of the First Education Department\\" (), was also his boss. Althoff had been able to undertake his responsibilities as \\"Vortragender Rat\\" with a remarkable degree of autonomy: that luxury was not available to Elster, who in most respects sustained the widely accepted \\"Althoff system\\". There are nevertheless instances where he was able to place his own stamp on universities administration. He promoted further major expansion of the M√ºnster Academy, to the point at which it could be relaunched as the \\"Westf√§lische Wilhelms- Universit√§t\\" / WWU. He encouraged an increase in the study of economics and political sciences through creation of research institutes and new teaching chairs. Ludwig Elster won various marks of public recognition for his work at the ministry. He was appointed a Geheimrat (loosely, \\"privy councillor\\") of the Royal Order 1st class and of the Order of the Red Eagle 2nd class. He was also awarded honorary doctorates from at least three universities such as M√ºnster, Breslau and Kiel. In 1916, as a response to what had become a massive workload, Elster, now aged 60, quit the ministry and moved to Jena. Here, from 1922 he served as an honorary professor and delivered lectures on social sciences and economics at the university. His political instincts, like those of most senior civil servants, were politically conservative. Early on during the Weimar years he joined the National People's Party (\\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\\" / DNVP). As politics became ever more polarised he was also listed as a supporting member (\\"F√∂rderndes Mitglied\\") of the SS (National Socialist paramilitaries). After the National Socialists took power, in January 1933, he was required to resign as producer of the \\"Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik\\" series, however. Ludwig Elster's substantial documentary archive is held by the Th√ºringen University and State Library in Jena.  Work  The focus of Elster's early academic output was on the insurance and banking sectors. During his time as a lecturer he published several essays and books on those subjects. His later publications were more expressly intended to support university-level teaching requirements. With Johannes Conrad, Wilhelm Lexis and Edgar Loening he produced the \\"Handw√∂rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften\\" series of teaching texts. Between 1890 and 1921 these extended to four editions. Elster himself supplemented the series with his own \\"Dictionary of Applied Economics\\" (\\"W√∂rterbuch der Volkswirtschaft\\"), intended for use by students and professionals. This also ran to four editions during his lifetime. For most of his working life Elster was engaged with the annually published \\"Jahrb√ºchern f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik\\" (statistical and economics year books). While still a student he was recruited by its then producer, Bruno Hildebrand, for editorial work. From the 1880s he regularly published essays and academic book reviews in it, Johannes Conrad having taken over the publication, following the death of his father-in-law. Elster himself joined Conrad as co-publisher between 1891 and 1897. When Conrad died, in 1915, Elster returned to the Jahrb√ºchern, now as sole publisher.

She was the first and only woman to become a Privatdozent in chemistry in the Weimar Republic. After the Nazis banned Jews from holding academic positions in Germany in 1933, she moved to England and then to the United States where she worked for the Eastman Kodak Company. Her main areas of research were photochemistry and reaction kinetics.  Education  Gertrud Kornfeld grew up in a middle-class German-speaking Jewish household in Prague, which was at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She studied chemistry from 1910-1915, at the German school of the Karl-Ferdinands- Universit√§t in Prague. She received her doctorate in 1915 with the dissertation √úber Hydrate in L√∂sungen (On hydrates in solutions) and was employed as an assistant to her advisor Victor Rothmund. She worked first as a demonstrator, and from 1914-1918 as an assistant.  Germany  In October 1918, at the end of World War I, Czechoslovakia was formed as one of the countries succeeding the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Kornfeld left Prague in 1919 and got a job as a trainee assistant to Max Bodenstein at the K√∂nigliche Technische Hochschule in Hannover, (later the Technical University of Hanover). In 1923 Kornfeld moved with Bodenstein to the Institute of Physical Chemistry at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t (later the Humboldt University of Berlin). In 1928 Gertrud Kornfeld habilitated in chemistry in Berlin. She was the first and only woman to become a Privatdozent in chemistry at a university in the Weimar Republic. On April 7, 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service in Germany was passed, banning Jews from holding public positions, including teaching positions. Along with nearly one-third of the University of Berlin's teaching staff and nearly half of its private lecturers, Kornfeld was deprived of her teaching license and any further possibility of employment in German academia. England Kornfeld was able to emigrate to England in 1933. She apparently received some assistance from the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning (SPSL) at the University of Birmingham. The SPSL, which was initially known as the Academic Assistance Council, formed in London in 1933. Kornfeld was on the List of Displaced German Scholars compiled by the SPSL and published in 1936. She also received support from the British Federation of University Women (BFUW) in London to teach at the University of Nottingham. In 1934 she received an emergency German Scholar Residential Fellowship for a year, from a fund raised by the BFUW specifically for German exiles. This allowed her to do research at the Imperial College London in South Kensington. In 1936, she received an International Fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW), enabling her to study in Vienna. United States of America Relocation, for younger women, was perhaps easier. Kornfeld was older and better established in her field in 1933. Even with positive recommendations from Max Bodenstein and physicist Friedrich Paschen, it was difficult for her to find a new position at her level and in her specialization. She initially resisted the idea of teaching at a women's college, or going into industrial research. In 1937, Esther Brunauer of the AAUW vouched for Kornfeld, enabling her to travel on a visitor visa to the United States. There she found a position in the research laboratory of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York. Her specialized knowledge of photochemistry was valued, and she became head of a small research group. She was able to continue her career successfully in spite of the repeated political upheavals that had affected her. In 1948, Kornfeld was honored as a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences, for her work at Kodak.

Territory  Its territory (almost entirely hills and woodlands, with many streams and springs) although surrounded by densely populated areas, shows well preserved and peaceful woodlands, and constitutes a vast greenland which offers many aspects of interest: its environmental characteristics are quite peculiar, displaying interesting geological and botanical features. Historical traces are remarkable: notably, middle-age fortifications and World-War 1 military works (Cadorna Line), as well as archeological sites of great importance dating from pre-historical times. The Park covers some of the oldest suburbs of Como, and religious buildings are a major feature, some dating to the very first times of Christianity, of great artistic and architectural worth. The park offers also extraordinary views and landscapes, being located entirely on a highland ridge rising steeply from the Lombard plain and looking north the view dominates the lake of Como; on the south, the park overlooks the lombard plain allowing an exceptional view in every direction. The Parco Spina Verde is easily accessible by several ways of communications: it is reached by rail or motorway, and a thick net of footpaths covers its entire territory joining the points of interest. Several restaurants, farms and inns provide quality accommodation and food around the year.  Natural and environmental sites  Par√© swamp and wetland: located in the village of Colverde, is a small but interesting area featuring several natural springs, where live protected natural species (notably the Lataste Frog and the Salamander). Springs of river Seveso: sited on a hillside a few meters away the state border with Switzerland, it is a small stone building protecting the source of river Seveso. It is of remarkable natural importance due to a colony of river shrimps, elsewhere nearly extinct. Camerlata stone quarry: the stone used to build, among other, the Baradello Castle and the cathedrals of Como, has been extracted in this quarry for centuries. Now derelict, the quarry hosts a fascinating site with deep caves and vertical ravines. It can be visited on demand. The Border Road: a wide track crossing the woods, on the top of a high, forest-covered ridge, this rustic road runs along the state frontier with Switzerland and the border fence marks its northern limit for the most part. A popular path among hikers and trekkers, it joins several points of interest: the Par√© Swamp, the Cadorna Line and, in Swiss territory just across the national border fence, a monument marks the southernmost point of the Swiss Confederacy, often visited by swiss tourists. Another interesting fact is that the Border Road was once much in use by smugglers: makeshift stores and hideouts can still be seen.  Archeological sites  Mojenca spring: named after a celtic word meaning ‚Äúwet, soaked‚Äù, it is one of the most striking places of the park. It consists of a natural spring in a deep rocky groove, which was covered and flanked by walls and a stone roof, in three separate phases the oldest of which dates to 3000 years ago and was used for religious cults, probably druidic, for many centuries. An amazing feature of the spring is that on Winter Solstice (December 21st), the rays of the setting sun enter the spring illuminating it: a clear trace of its ancient religious role. It is one of the very few sites of its times still visible and preserved. Pianvalle village: joined to Mojenca spring by a country track, it is a remarkable site showing remains of an ancient dwelling with working areas, dating back to 5th-6th century BC. Rock carvings and buildings foundations lead to identify it as a permanent, important settlement. Roccia di Prestino: the ‚ÄúPrestino Rock‚Äù is a rocky wall nearby an ancient cart-track winding up the hillside, and used since very ancient times. It shows traces of symbolic carvings, dated to the Copper Age, leading to point out this site as a ritual place. Stone Rooms: there are three known stone rooms carved in the rocky hillside during the Bronze Age, whose purpose is still uncertain: dwellings, stables, store, or other. Certainly, they required a great amount of labor and are all south-west oriented, indicating a common schema. The largest is called Camera Grande (en.: ‚Äúgreat room‚Äù) and shows interesting carvings on its walls, and well-made drainage channels. A narrow path in the woods leads to another stone room (Camera Carugo) and shortly after to a third and smaller one (Camera Ovale). They are considered very important artifacts, as rare examples of the first human-made permanent dwellings in this area.  Historical sites  Baradello Castle: built upon pre-existing Roman and Lombard fortifications, the castle is iconic of Como, with its main tower visible from afar. Once keystone of a huge defensive complex which included walls and ramparts running down and up the narrow passage through the steep hills, the Baradello castle (according to some sources, owning its name to a celtic word meaning ‚Äústeep hillside/cliff‚Äù) was built in 12th century by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I ‚ÄúRedbeard‚Äù as a defence stronghold against the Milanese troops, during the century-long conflict between Como (faithful to the emperor) and Milan (rebel to the emperor). Long a symbol of the power of middle-age Como, the castle and the walls were dismantled by the Spanish troops in late 16th century. Only the tower survives, and is open to visits on demand. the main tower of the Baradello Castle Cadorna Line: during 1917-18, the Italian army chief-of-staff, general Luigi Cadorna, ordered the construction of a 50ml defensive line along most of the border with Switzerland, to forestall a possible German attempt to invade Switzerland and attack Italy through the Alps. This conspicuous military complex included what is nowadays the territory of the Park, and many interesting works can still be seen, notably on the Sasso di Cavallasca Hill: blockhouses, caves, trenches, underground galleries and passages, most in good conditions and open to visits. Cascina Respa√π di Sopra: this ancient fortified farm, just nearby Baradello Castle, was built to provide the castle with food supplies (vegetables and cattle) for ordinary and emergency needs and was the center of a large agricultural complex including terraces and flat high grounds, once intensely cultivated, still visible. Today the farm is an inn and a restaurant. Stairway to Heaven (‚ÄúScala del Paradiso‚Äù): built at the beginning of 20th century, it is an impressive work remnant of the ‚ÄúSmugglers Age‚Äù, when Como was the center of an illicit yet prosperous industry: smuggling across the Italian-swiss border. With more than 900 steps in solid stone, the Stairway led from the top of Cavallasca Hill descending the hill‚Äôs slope down to the town of Ponte Chiasso, flanking the state border fence that runs a few yards away. Meant to help the Italian Customs Guard in its duties, ironically it served smugglers just as well. Refurbished in 2005 the Stairway, locally nicknamed ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven‚Äù, is now an attraction to trekkers and hikers and witnesses an era still alive in Como's memories. Army Powder Store: in the valley of Valbasca, at the easternmost part of the park, it is still visible an abandoned ammunition depot of the Italian army, built in 1930s. It is a part of Como‚Äôs history as in 1941 it suffered the only air raid occurred in Como, when British airplanes bombed the depot with no results because all of the ammunition had been previously removed. The Powder Depot, for its history facts and its scenic location, is a favorite place for hikers.  Religious buildings  Church of the Holy Lady in Drezzo (Chiesa di Madonna Assunta): this ancient church is sited in a scenic location, on the top of a hill overlooking the village of Drezzo (Colverde). It keeps interesting paintings dated to the 15th century, though the church is certainly older, as show its apse and isle of romanic style. San Rocco Church-Painters‚Äô Church (Chiesa di S. Rocco o dei Pittori): Built in 1857 on the remains of an older chapel, it is located on the hillside of the village of Cavallasca. It owes its name to the 14 artists who, in 1978, there painted the scenes of the Passion of Christ. Basilica di San Carpoforo: probably the most ancient church of Como and among the oldest Christian religious buildings, it is mentioned as back as of 386 AD, when Saint Felix, first bishop of Como, ordered the construction of a church on the site of an ancient Roman temple where, in 311 AD, Saint Carpoforo and his companions had been executed because of their Christian faith. In this church, where Saint Carpoforo and later Saint Felix himself were buried, the very first Christian community of Como was established. A good example of romanic style, its architectural outlay is yet quite peculiar, with the front side facing the mountain (the entrance is through a small door on the left wall). the vault of St. Carpoforo Basilica, the most ancient surviving part of the building: both St. Carpoforo and St. Felix were buried here. the St. Abbondio Basilica,a jewel of Lombard romanic, built in 1095 Basilica di San Abbondio: a masterful example of Lombard late-romanic style, at the southern end of the Park, the Basilica boasts two bell-towers: a common feature in german and french cathedrals but quite unusual in Italy. Built over an ancient proto-christian chapel, on the very side of the once strategic road called ‚ÄúVia Regina‚Äù (Royal Way) that linked Como with the swiss mountain passes and northern Europe, the Basilica was built in 1095 AD and refurbished and retouched several times after. The impressive entrance gates with their extensive carvings are considered a masterpiece of the famous ‚ÄúMagistri Comacini‚Äù (Como‚Äôs Craftsmen); the apse shows important paintings of the life of Christ, dated 13th century. Oratorio dei Santi Cosma e Damiano (Shrine of Saint Cosma and Saint Damiano): a small church close to the nearby Basilica of Saint Abbondio, was built on the vault of a pagan temple and long used as a place of healing for the sick and the wounded. Today it is an exhibition space, and hosts several events around the year.  Panoramic sites  Due to its location, stretched along an elevated ridge rising steeply from the plain, the Parco Spina Verde has a strong panoramic vocation. Many viewpoints, built along the footpaths, allow exceptional sights of the Lombard plain (south) which, on clear days, can range as far as the Ligurian Apennines; looking north, the visitor has a stunning view of the Swiss Alps and of the town and lake of Como.  Visitors‚Äô Tracks and foothpats  No less than 13 different paths, built partly on pre-existing country- and military roads, covering the entire territory of the Park, allow to visit every corner. The paths have been designed to touch and link different subjects and environments: there are the Border Path, the Valbasca Path, the Fitness Path, the Castle Path, the Archeological Path to name but a few. A thick net of tracks and cart-roads still in use by farmers and woodsmen links all the paths.  Wildlife  The Parco Spina Verde enjoys a well-preserved environment where many species find an ideal refuge. a wild boar Among birds, one can find the Owl, the Sparrowhawk, the Heron, the Red Kite and the Woodpecker. a Woodpecker Among wild animals, the Boar has grown conspicuous in numbers in the last years; Roe Deers are a constant presence too, as well as the Fox, the Red Squirrel, the Badger. The Volunteer Ecological Service and the National Guard of Lombardy ensure the vigilance over Park wildlife, structures and foothpaths and the enforcement of the Park General Rules.  Communications and ways of access  The Park is easily reached in Como itself, by motorway (A9 - exit Como Center) or railway (Trenord - station of Como-Camerlata, or FFS, station of Como - S. Giovanni).

The World Digital Library describes it as the \\"first and most important scientific map of the Philippines\\". It is frequently referred to as the \\"Mother of all Philippine Maps\\". During the British Occupation of Manila, the copper plates used to print the map were seized and transported to England where they were used to produce multiple copies of the map before the plates were destroyed and reused. Many of the most famous and expensive copies were from this re- printing. Map The map's title includes the following additional description: dedicada al Rey Nuestro Se√±or por el Mariscal d. Campo D. Fernando Valdes Tamon Cavallo del Orden de Santiago de Govor. Y Capn General de dichas Yslas (Spanish, \\"dedicated to the King Our Lord by Field Marshal Fernando Tamon Valdes, Knight of the Order of Santiago, Governor and Captain General of said Islands\\"). The map was created upon the behest of then governor-general Fernando Valdes y Tamon in response to an order from Philip V of Spain. The map shows maritime routes from Manila to Spain and New Spain. The Spanish royal coat of arms occupies a prominent space in the upper-middle portion of the map. On its flanks are twelve images, six to a side. Eight of these images depict various ethnic groups residing in the archipelago. The remaining four are cartographic depictions of cities and islands. The ethnic groups and individuals depicted include Chinese Filipinos (\\"Sangley\\") or Chinese, Cafres or East Africans brought to Manila slave market by Portuguese, a Canarin (a native of India on the Konkani coast, most likely a Goan or Mangalorean), a Lascar from India, mestizos, a Mardica (natives of Ternate and Tidore), a Japanese (\\"Japon\\"), Spaniards, Criollos, Filipino natives (\\"Indios\\"), Aetas, an Armenian, a Mughal, a native of the Malabar region and a Visayan. Maps of \\"Samboagan\\" (known today as Zamboanga City, a city in Mindanao), the port of Cavite, the island of \\"Guajan\\" (Guam) and Manila, and illustrations of endemic plants and animals occupy the remaining sections. The Murillo Velarde map was widely reprinted. These include reproductions in Manila (1744), Vienna (1748) by Kaliwoda, Nuremberg (1760) by Lowitz, and in the first volume of Juan de la Concepcion's Historia General de Philipinas (1788). Copies There are less than 50 extant copies of the map. Some are mounted on a cloth backing measuring 112x120 cm. The map itself measures 108x71 cm and is on a scale approximating 1:1,400,000. *The American Library of Congress Geography and Map Division in Washington, D.C. has one copy of the original 1734 printing, Call No. G8060 1734 .M8. *The National Library of Spain in Madrid has one copy of the original 1734 printing, Call No. MR/45/31. *The National Library of France has a copy. *There is one copy in a private collection in the Philippines. *In 2014 the Duke of Northumberland, Ralph Percy had a copy of the map auctioned off by Sotheby's. Filipino businessman Mel Velarde won the auction, paying ¬£170,500.00 (approximately ‚Ç±12 million) for it. This copy had been printed by the British using the 8 original Murillo Velarde copperplates which had been looted from Manila by William Draper during the British occupation of Manila in 1762. Draper donated the plates to Cambridge University and the university printed copies of the map, one of which later came into the possession of the Duke of Northumberland of the late 18th century. The British however, later melted down the copperplates and reused the metal in printing their Admiralty charts. Velarde donated the map to the National Museum of the Philippines in 2017. *In 2019, a copy of the 18th Century British printing was purchased at an auction in the Philippines for 40 million Philippine pesos (US$), significantly more than the pre-auction estimate of 18 million pesos, by an unnamed Chinese Filipino buyer. This map was part of an unspecified private collection and one of at least three such versions currently in private collections in the Philippines. =Reduced version= Murillo Velarde also published a smaller version of the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas, one that did not include the twelve illustrations on the map's flanks. This version measures 51x33 cm. and was published in 1744. There are extant copies in the collections of the Lopez Museum, National Library of the Philippines and the Boston Public Library Norman B. Leventhal Map Center. South China Sea disputes The Murillo Velarde map has been instrumental in the Philippines' efforts to assert territorial rights in the South China Sea. The map, along with 270 other maps, was used by the Philippines' team of experts to refute China's historic claim of ownership of the entire South China Sea, as it features Scarborough Shoal then labelled as \\"Panacot\\", as well as \\"Los Bajos de Paragua\\" now known as the Spratly Islands. In 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines stating that China had \\"no historical rights\\" based on their Nine-Dash Line map. China however, rejected the ruling, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has decided not to act upon it.

He is one of very few male Arab belly dancers, and is known for his thought provoking work and the social issues he tackles through his art. He studied at the University of Paris VIII majoring in Theater and Dance. He returned to Beirut in 2006, where he is now permanently based, and has since \\"been creating spaces of reflection on Middle-Eastern dance through his work as a choreographer, a teacher and a performer\\". Today he specializes in contemporary Baladi dance, a new dance form he has created and divulged. Early life and career Paulikevitch was born in Lebanon where he grew up in a conservative Armenian Christian neighborhood of Beirut. He embraced his sexuality early-on and came out as a homosexual man to his friends and family at the age of 16. His solo debut in Beirut was in 2009 with ‚ÄúMouhawala Oula‚Äù (Arabic for \\"First Try\\") with which he begins to challenge gender stereotypes. = Homosexuality = Although a relatively progressive country in the Middle East, homosexuality has not yet been decriminalized in Lebanon. As a male with a feminine demeanor, he is often the target of derogatory catcalls when in public. In one of his first solo shows, entitled Tajwal, Paulikevitch dances to a compilation of insults directed at him on the streets of Beirut, turning his suffering into art. = Gender = Paulikevitch's work also redefines \\"gender roles through oriental dance\\". As a male dancer of Baladi, he uses his body to question gender stereotypes in the Middle East. Baladi appellation One of the main missions Paulikevitch claims for himself is to battle what he describes as 'the colonial designation' of 'Belly Dance'. In describing his work, he aims to reclaim the native significance and original Egyptian appellation Baladi ‚Äî Arabic for my country or land. His main critique is that the term 'Belly Dance' was created through the colonial gaze to eroticize this dance, condemning it as female and suggestive. As a male Arab dancer within this tradition, he combats these stereotypes, thus reclaiming a space for a male figure in a female dominated world. Features Paulikevitch was featured locally and internationally in many outlets. This includes an episode of the Netflix series We Speak Dance, hosted by Vandana Hart and filmed in Beirut; a New York Times article, \\"Coming Out in Lebanon\\" about openly queer and transsexual individuals in Lebanon, and a BBC Culture documentary, The Male Belly Dancer Fighting Gender Stereotypes.

The facility encompasses a museum, library, and archive. The collections are composed of masonic ceremonial objects, jewellery, regalia, ceramics, glassware, silverware, clocks, furniture, books, prints and manuscripts relating to English freemasonry and its interactions with overseas lodges and orders. It also retains artefacts relating to other associated fraternal orders and friendly societies such as the Oddfellows, Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Sons of the Phoenix and Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. The Museum is open to the public Monday to Saturday, 10am to 5pm. Admission is free.  History  At the Quarterly Communication of the United Grand Lodge of England on 7 March 1838, it was announced: \\"...that a sum of money not exceeding ¬£100 to be placed at the disposal of the Board for the purpose of providing for the reception of books, manuscripts and objects of masonic interest, and for commencing the formation of the Library and Museum.\\" Following a campaign for donations among members, by 1841 the Library and Museum was open to English freemasons of the Grand Lodge. When the third and present Freemasons‚Äô Hall opened at Great Queen Street in 1933 it included a dedicated space for the Library and Museum, which was a stipulation of the architectural competition won by architects Ashley and Newman. Gordon Hills was the Librarian and Curator who oversaw this most significant move, and the original space remains the home of the Museum today. In the 1980s the Library and Museum began opening to the public for the first time on certain days, and in 1996, under Librarian and Curator John Hamil, the Library and Museum became a charitable trust. The permanent collection held by the Museum that existed before the change in 1996 is a permanent loan from the United Grand Lodge of England and makes up approximately 80% of the collection. From 1996, new acquisitions, whether purchased or donated, normally belong to the Library and Museum Charitable Trust. From 2001 there has been an evolving electronic catalogue and succession of supporting public exhibitions and events. From 2003, various projects partly funded by external bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, have seen certain sections of the archive collection catalogued. In 1999 the Trust appointed Diane Clements as Director who oversaw an individual Librarian, Curator and Archivist to manage each department. The appointment of Mrs Clements broke with the tradition of having a mason in charge of the collection, although trustees include senior members of Grand Lodge. In 2017, Mrs Clements was succeeded by Dr Vicky Carroll as Director, who has begun a process of redevelopment beginning with a change of name from the Library and Museum of Freemasonry to the Museum of Freemasonry.  Building  The Museum of Freemasonry is located on the first floor of Freemasons' Hall, Great Queen Street, London. Originally known as the Masonic Peace Memorial Building, the imposing landmark found on the edge of Covent Garden was designed by architects Ashley and Newman in the Art Deco style and completed in 1933. It is a Grade II* listed building today. In addition to the Grand Temple, offices, lodge meeting rooms and the Museum, Freemasons' Hall is a frequently used venue for television and film productions such as James Bond, Assassin's Creed, Spooks and The Crown being shot there more recently. The Museum of Freemasonry provides free guided tours of the building, taking in the Grand Temple and Shrine. Tours are not available when the Grand Temple of other areas are in use for ceremonial purposes, and groups must book in advance.  Activities  = Library and Archives = The Museum of Freemasonry's reference library and archives provide a number of services including family history and biographical research. There are over 1.7 million names listed in the digital registers from 1751-1921, and are fully searchable by individual name available through subscription to www.ancestry.co.uk or freely accessible at the library. Lane's Masonic Records Since 2003 the Museum has collaborated with the Humanities Research Institute at The University of Sheffield to digitise John Lane‚Äôs Masonic Records 1717-1894, which ‚Äúis an authoritative listing of all the lodges established by the English Grand Lodges from the foundation of the first Grand Lodge in 1717 up until 1894.‚Äù Masonic Periodicals Online: The Museum has digitised and made searchable a collection of masonic periodicals from 1790 up until 1900.

In 1915, she attended the International Women's Conference in The Hague, together with Thora Daugaard. Thereafter she helped establish and, from 1916 to 1920, headed the Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de or Danish Women's Peace Chain which became the Danish branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She is also remembered for helping to bring hunger-stricken children from Vienna to Denmark after the First World War. Early life and education Born on 3 March 1864 in Kalvehave Parish near Vordingborg, Clara Sophie Sarauw was the daughter of the forester Conrad August Nicolaus Sarauw (1816‚Äì1886) og Betzy Wilhelmine Hansen (1834‚Äì1909). After her father died she moved to Copenhagen where she worked as a teacher at Den Kellerske √Öndssvageanstalt which specialized in educating handicapped children. She then went to the United States where she worked and continued her studies at the Pennsylvania Training School for Feebleminded Children until 1892. On 18 May 1893, she married the high court judge Erland Tybjerg (1863‚Äì1925). The following year, she was employed as an English teacher at H. Adlers F√¶llesskole, the first mixed school in Denmark, where she remained until 1915. Even after she left, she continued to be interested in education, especially in connection with handicapped children. Participation in the Danish women's movement Tybjerg was an active participant in the Danish women's movement. In 1913, she became the international secretary for Danske Kvinders Nationalr√•d (The Women's Council in Denmark) and was also a member of Kvindelig L√¶seforening (Women Readers' Association). Until Danish women finally succeeded in achieving universal suffrage in 1915, she and her sister Elna Munch fought for the cause. Career as a peace activist In 1915, she attended the International Women's Peace Conference in the Hague. On returning to Denmark, together with Thora Daugaard, she founded Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de (DKF), the Danish arm of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Tybjerg was responsible for setting up a study network consisting of 30 women, including Gyrithe Lemche, Henni Forchhammer, Estrid Hein, Matilde Bajer and Ellen H√∏rup. They travelled throughout Denmark encouraging women to become members of the DKF by paying one \\"peace crown\\" (fredskrone) and signing a list calling for \\"Justice rather than Might\\". Tybjerg chaired the organization from 1915 to 1920, increasing membership to around 10,000. After local branches were established throughout Denmark, she chaired the Copenhagen branch from 1921 to 1925. Thora Daugaard succeeded her as chair of the DKF. After the hostilities of the First World War finally subsided, the WILPF organized a second conference in Zurich. Tybjerg, representing the Danish branch, called for special attention to be given to the needs of children and young people. From about 1921, she actively strove to provide support for children in Vienna who were suffering from malnutrition. She succeeded in have many of them brought to Denmark where they could be restored to health in Danish homes. Personal life Tybjerg was married and had two children. After losing her husband in 1925, she spent a few years in Hiller√∏d where she continued to participate in peace initiatives. She died in Copenhagen on 14 January 1941. She is buried in Tibirke Cemetery near Tisvilde.

Early life Montagu was the only son of Sir James Montagu, MP and judge, and his first wife Tufton Wray, daughter of Sir William Wray, 1st Baronet, of Ashby, Lincolnshire. He was admitted at Lincolns Inn on 9 June 1712. In 1723 he succeeded to the estates of his father. He married after a settlement dated 10 April 1725, Ann Colladon, daughter of Sir Theodore Colladon of Chelsea, and sub-governess to the Princesses. Career Montagu was returned as Member of Parliament for Westminster in 1722 as a government supporter. He did not stand in 1727. At the 1734 general election, Richard Eliot brought him in as MP for St Germans. He became a supporter of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who appointed him Auditor general of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1735, and auditor of the household to Prince of Wales in 1738. He did not vote on the Spanish convention in 1739 or the place bill in 1740, and withdrew on a motion to remove Walpole in February 1741. At the 1741 general election, he was returned as MP for Camelford by Thomas Pitt who acted as the Prince's election manager. Montagu always voted with the Prince's party. At the 1747 general election, called by the King to challenge the Prince's opposition, Pitt tried to put Montagu up for Okehampton, but his initial hopes of success were thwarted by strong opposition there. The Prince of Wales died in 1751 and Montagu lost both of the posts in his service. He was appointed instead auditor to the household of the Princess. At the 1754 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Northampton on the interest of his cousin, George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax. Although considered to be a supporter of the Administration after 1754, he voted against the Address on 13 November 1755. Death and legacy Montagu died on 29 May 1759. He had two sons and a daughter. His widow became well known in society and was an intimate friend of Mary, dowager-countess of Gower (the widow of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower), and of Mary Delany, in whose published 'Correspondence' she frequently figures as 'my Mrs Montague', in order to distinguish her from the better known Elizabeth Montagu. Her London residence was in Hanover Square and she died on 31 May 1780.

It is considered to be glacial in origin, ice having over-ridden the area during successive ice ages. To its southeast is Murton Fell whilst Dufton Fell is to the north. The Ordnance Survey name the valley as High Cup Gill but it is often referred to by the name High Cup Nick, a name which properly refers in a more limited sense to the point at its northeastern limit where the headwaters of Highcup Gill Beck pass from the relatively flat terrain of High Cup Plain over the lip of High Cup Scar into the valley. 'Gill' is a word of Norse origin meaning narrow valley or ravine whilst 'beck' signifies a stream; both occur widely in the hills of northern England. As seen in the classic view southwest over the valley into the Vale of Eden from its head at High Cup Nick, it is considered one of the finest natural features in northern England. High Cup Nick High Cup Scar is formed by a near-horizontal outcrop of the Whin Sill, a dolerite intrusion of late Carboniferous age which underlies much of the North Pennines and northeast England. Tumbled blocks of this rock are scattered down the scree slopes beneath the scar. A notable pinnacle of this rock on the northern side of the valley is known as Nichol or Nichol's Chair after a local cobbler who, for a bet, practised his craft perched on its summit. The country rock into which the sill is intruded is the Alston Formation, a part of the Yoredale Group of multiple layers of limestones, sandstones, siltstones and mudstones. At the base of the gill, though largely obscured by the dolerite blocks, are older rocks: the sedimentary rocks of the Ravenstonedale Group and, beneath them, the metamorphosed slates and sandstones of the Skiddaw Group which date from the Ordovician period. The Pennine Way skirts the valley on its northern side by a traditional route known as 'Narrow Gate' as it runs from Dufton east via Maize Beck and Cauldron Snout to Forest in Teesdale. This national trail briefly splits into two separate routes running on either bank of Maize Beck; it is the southerly of the two which leads via High Cup Nick. Listed in the 100 best Pathfinder walks in Britain, High Cup Nick has been described as a difficult walk of 8miles, with an elevation of 1445 feet. The famous fellwalker Alfred Wainwright describes High Cup as \\"a great moment on the journey\\" in his book Pennine Way Companion. The village of Dufton lies between two of the most challenging sections of the Pennine Way. There are precipitous drops along the higher sections of the walk and the helm wind blowing through the valley can be very strong. The whole of the valley is within an area mapped as open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 hence there is a general right for walkers to roam at will. This section of the Pennine Way is a bridleway therefore legally available to cyclists and horseriders too.

It stands at an altitude of 448 metres on top of a rocky outcrop, which provides views over the coastline and inland areas. In addition to a baroque chapel, completed in 1710, the location contains the Palace of Peninha, which dates from 1918, as well as remains of a hermitage. The interiors of neither the chapel nor the palace can presently be visited. View of the Sanctuary of Peninha, near Sintra in Portugal. The chapel of Nossa Senhora da Peninha is in the foreground with the 20th Century house (or palace) on the hill above. History The Peninha hills had been the location for a small hermitage ever since the foundation of Christianity in Portugal. Evidence of the physical foundations of a medieval hermitage can still be seen and archaeological excavations carried out by the Sintra‚ÄìCascais Natural Park uncovered a necropolis made up of graves excavated in the rock, with burials dating from the end of the 12th century, together with a cistern dug into the rock. The Hermitage of San Saturnino was built on the site in the mid-sixteenth century, added to in the seventeenth century and used by monks until the dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal in 1834. It was still occupied by farmers until the 1960s, when it passed to being used as a barn. Entrance to the chapel The site became popular during the rule of King John III of Portugal (1521 - 1557) as one where the Virgin Mary appeared to a young shepherdess. Following earlier attempts to build a chapel after the vision, the present Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Penha was constructed by the monks around a century after the apparition, with financial assistance from King Dom Pedro II and was completed in 1711. Inscriptions inside the chapel on the 1726 grave of the hermit, Pedro da Concei√ß√£o, and elsewhere, acknowledge his role in building the chapel. The interior of the chapel, which is considered an excellent example of baroque architecture in Portugal, is entirely covered by tiled panels representing scenes of the life of the Virgin Mary, together with representations of the Pentecost and the childhood of Jesus. There are also marble inlays. Given its altitude of 448 metres and difficulty of access, visiting the sanctuary became a form of penance, as well as a popular pilgrimage site for sailors‚Äô families, who would both pray for the safe return of the sailors and try to see returning ships from the summit, which gives visibility out to sea of up to 50 kilometres. In 1892 Peninha was purchased by the first Count of Almedina. The final construction at Peninha was a mansion built by the Portuguese entomologist and businessman Ant√≥nio Augusto Carvalho Monteiro, who also built the Quinta da Regaleira in nearby Sintra. The uncompleted house followed the Romanticism style. It was never lived in as Carvalho Monteiro died before its completion. His original plan had been to build a smaller version of the Pena Palace in Sintra. In Portuguese ‚Äúpena‚Äù means ‚Äúrock outcrop‚Äù, while ‚Äúpeninha‚Äù refers to a smaller outcrop. On his death the property was sold to Dr. Jos√© Maria Ferreira Rangel de Sampaio who requested an architect to prepare designs to finalize the work of the palace. However, work was not carried out and on the death of Dr. Sampaio he left the palace to the University of Coimbra. The entire complex of 62 hectares was purchased by the Government in 1991 and was placed under the management of the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests. In June 2017 it was announced that agreement had been reached for the Sintra Parks to carry out rehabilitation of the Sanctuary of Peninha. The agreement foresees the elaboration of a Management Plan to promote nature conservation and education, together with improved security and maintenance of the complex. It is also planned to better link other nearby places of interest in the Sintra mountains with the sanctuary, such as Anta de Adrenunes, the Convent of the Capuchos, and Cabo da Roca.

L. (1986). The taxonomical composition of the family Microcotylidae Taschenberg, 1879 (Monogenea). Folia Parasitologica, 33, 199-206. PDF Morphology Microcotyle toba has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a symmetrical spindel- shaped body, and comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is narrow, not well delineated from body proper, and bears 23 pairs of clamps. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two oval anterior buccal suckers placed ventrolaterally in the buccal cavity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a small oval muscular pharynx, a very short oesophagus and a posterior intestine with two lateral branches provided with many ramifications which enters the vitellaria. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium armed with numerous conical pointed slightly recurved spines, a dorsal vagina, a single S-shaped ovary, 25-30 of follicular testes which are postovarian and situated in the intercecal field. Diagnosis According to Ishii & Sawada, Microcotyle toba is most closely related to Microcotyle hiatulae, it can be distinguished from it by the number of testes, shape of ovary and of intestine, and measurements. Etymology The specific epithet toba refers to Toba, the type-locality of Microcotyle toba. Hosts and localities The mottled spinefoot Siganus fuscescens is the type-host of Microcotyle toba The type-host of Microcotyle toba is the mottled spinefoot Siganus fuscescens (Siganidae).

The novel was made into a movie, but the film changed some of the geography of the island.Notably, the town of Margaritha from the novel is renamed Mandrakos. The Guns of Navarone, directed by J. Lee Thompson (Culver City: Columbia Pictures, 1961). Although Navarone does not exist, its history is based on the real history of the Aegean Islands of Greece. Setting and terrain MacLean not only invented the island of Navarone, but he also created a whole setting for it in the eastern Aegean. In the novel, Navarone forms part of the Sporades Islands group. Four miles to the east of Navarone's main town lies mainland Turkey. North of the island, the Turkish coast juts out into a sharp promontory, the fictional Cape Demirci. The promontory is rimmed with rock but dimpled with coves of white sand beaches. Beyond the coast rise the towering Anatolian mountains. About sixteen miles north of the cape, according to the book, is the island of Kheros, which features importantly in the novel. To the west is the fictional Lerades group of islands, which stretches in a northwesterly direction for 60 miles. The closest of the Lerades is Maidos, six miles from Navarone. At one point in the book, a character on Navarone spots whitewashed fishermen's villages on Maidos. To the south is the Dodecanese group.Alistair MacLean, The Guns of Navarone (Greenwich: Fawcett Publications, 1957), 11, 12, 197, 212. The Sterling Publications edition of 2011 includes a map of the island and a map of Navarone town. Alistair MacLean, The Guns of Navarone (New York: Sterling Publishing, 2011). Although Kheros, Maidos, and the Lerades are invented, the Sporades and Dodecanese islands are real.Gordon F. Rietveld, Jane Rietveld, Greece, Aegean Island Guide (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1982), 21, 85. The Guns of Navarone thus provides both a fictional setting for its plot and frames this setting within the real world of the Aegean. MacLean implies that Navarone Island measures roughly 100 square miles. He describes a variety of terrain, from low-lying areas where carob tree groves thrive to snow-capped mountains. Virtually the entire coast is ringed with cliffs. This is particularly true in the south of the island. One character in the novel asserts: ‚ÄúThe entire south coast of Navarone . . . consists of one vast, impossible precipice.‚Äù At its highest point, the southern cliff is one quarter of a mile long and rises to a height of 400 feet. At the top of this cliff is a narrow, bare strip of ground, and then a fifty-yard-wide jumble of large boulders. The top of the cliff is accessible by a path, but the soil is soft, crumbling, and treacherous. At the base of the cliff, fifteen to twenty yards out in the water is a reef, ‚Äúgap-toothed and needle-pointed.‚ÄùMacLean, 17, 18, 19, 31, 79, 88, 90, 106, 117, 145. The fictional southern cliffs of Navarone are reminiscent of the real cliffs of the island of Thira, or Santorini. Thera‚Äôs tall cliffs of lava, ash, pumice, and slag are part of the remains of an ancient volcano.Rietveld, 191. Above the southern cliffs rise the mountains of Navarone. Their slopes are steep and wind-swept, covered in scree and scattered with boulders and shallow depressions. A few huts for shepherds and goatherds are the only habitations. Characters in the novel see their ‚Äúgrim, jagged‚Äù peaks from at least fifty miles away. The highest mountain is Mount Kostos. When the novel places characters on its slopes, snowfall is heavy and continuous, impressing one character as being more than in the White Mountains of Crete. Southern Navarone is honeycombed with caves, some of piled volcanic slabs.MacLean, 48, 88, 123, 125, 136-137, 139, 152. The comparison in the novel to mountains on the island of Crete seems apt. The Lefka Ori, or White Mountains, are snow-capped in winter, and exhibit many stretches of scree, or loose stones. Isolated shepherd and goatherd huts can be seen among the heights.Nicky Holford, Off the Cretan Track, The Guardian, October 23, 1999. https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/oct/23/walkingholidays.greece (accessed January 10, 2019). Towns and villages As described by MacLean, much of Navarone is taken up by fields or wasteland, but several towns and villages also dot the island. The largest, of around 5,000 people, is the town of Navarone on the north coast. The town lies on an almost circular, volcanic bay with a narrow entrance to the northwest. In the novel, the harbor contains both a fleet of ca√Øques and several German tenders. To the west of the harbor, the terrain slopes up gently to a series of olive groves, and the dusty streets run down to the water. In the south, the streets run parallel to the water down to the old town, the ground rising more sharply to the south. Dominating the town are a line of cliffs one hundred and fifty feet above the harbor, and a large fortress, its walls built of large blocks of masonry pierced by narrow embrasures. The central plot of the novel, a British raid on the German garrison in 1943, leads to the destruction of much of the fortification. A particular feature of the fortress is a massive mound of volcanic rock towering over the walls and a large cave with a heavy overhang jutting out over the harbor. There is a sheer, 120-foot drop from the mouth of the cave to the surface of the water.MacLean, 11, 198, 234, 256, 269. In the outskirts of Navarone town, the novel describes high-walled terraced market gardens, a decaying Byzantine church, and a whitewashed Orthodox Christian monastery. In the lower town, one finds narrow, winding, and dimly-lit streets, only inches wider than a car, hugely cobbled, with almost knee high pavements. In one scene, MacLean describes a highly ornamented latticework grille protecting the outside landing at top of a set of white stairs. The main square abuts the southern side of the old fortress. Houses on the west side of the square are flat-roofed (to catch winter rains), and are fairly modern, built of whitewashed stone and Parian granite. The east side of the square, in contrast, mostly has antiquated timber and turf houses similar to those found in remote mountain villages.MacLean, 227-229. As with other details in the novel, MacLean models Navarone town on real Greek towns. For example, visitors to Thera can see a small monastery and the Orthodox cathedral of Panagia Ypapanti.Holford, 192, 195. The novel describes a tavern in Navarone as having walls, tables, chairs, and shelves painted a bright (MacLean calls it garish) blue. Advertisements for Fix beer, a real product, adorn the walls. The novel claims that wine shops are painted red, and sweetmeat shops green.MacLean, 255. The website for Fix beer can be found at https://www.fix-beer.gr/en/homepage/ (accessed January 10, 2019). About three miles south of Navarone town, according to the novel, lies the village of Margaritha. It is located in a fold of hills near the mouth of an almost perfectly-symmetrical valley that extends about four miles to the mountains in the south. It is small, with flat-roofed houses, and lies on the bank of a little stream that winds through the valley. The village square is shaded by plane trees. Olive groves lie to the south of the village.MacLean, 21, 125-126, 196. At one point in The Guns of Navarone, characters shelter in a notable terrain feature between Margaritha and Navarone called ‚Äúthe Devil‚Äôs Playground.‚Äù It is a region of ‚Äúgaunt, shattered‚Äù cliffs that rise steeply above the stunted, gnarled carob trees in the plain. Rock-strewn ravines cleave through the cliffs and wind aimlessly into the interior of the Playground or come abruptly to dead ends. The area is riddled with caves, leading some people to call it ‚ÄúLittle Cyprus.‚ÄùMacLean, 197, 203, 209. The real island of Cyprus is indeed known for its caves, both those on land and along the seashore.http://www.cyprusalive.com/en/location/caves-sea-caves (accessed January 10, 2019). Early history The Guns of Navarone focuses on World War II, and provides only limited information about the early history of Navarone. The novel describes the castle at Vygos, 2 miles on the coast road to the east of Navarone town, and ascribes its construction to the Franks. The castle is small, essentially a manor house built around crenellated towers.MacLean, 232, 248. In reality, the islands of the eastern Aegean have had many masters. The Persian Empire, the empire of Alexander the Great, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Franks, the Venetians, and the Ottoman Empire have each ruled for a time and then departed before modern Greece claimed the islands.John Haywood, Atlas of World History (Abingdon: Andromeda Oxford Ltd., 1997), 20, 21, 29, 41, 48, 54, 59, 110. MacLean states that, for several generations, the island has been owned by the Vlachos family. The head of the family in the novel, Eugene Vlachos, is also a consul and a senior official of the Greek government.MacLean, 19, 20, 150. Axis occupation in World War II The Guns of Navarone is mainly about a daring Allied raid in 1943 that causes significant damage to the German installations on the island. In actuality, Nazi Germany conquered the Kingdom of Greece in April 1941. As part of the campaign, the German 164th Division launched amphibious landings on Greek islands in the Aegean.George E. Blau, The German Campaign in the Balkans (Spring 1941) (Washington, D.C.: Center for Military History, United States Army, 1984), 86, 96, 111. The novel reflects this campaign, with German forces occupying nearly all of the Sporades, including Navarone. The British spirit Eugene Vlachos out of Navarone to Egypt ahead of the German advance, to avoid reprisals against him. One Vlachos retainer, Eugene's steward Louki, remains loyal to the family and aids the Allied raiders. Life is not easy for the inhabitants of occupied Navarone. Many abandon their homes in Navarone town for Margaritha and other outlying villages. The sight of Germans occupying the fortress is particularly galling to those who live on the main square near the walls. The novel notes that German officers have moved into many of the empty houses on west side of the square.MacLean, 13, 19-21, 229. British and German moves, 1943 The Guns of Navarone describes how, in the late summer and early fall of 1943, the United Kingdom sends missions to many of the Aegean islands. Much of the British effort is led by elements of the Long Range Desert Group and the Special Boat Service (SBS). By September, British troops hold most of the big islands, with some garrisons at or above battalion strength. However, the British bypass Navarone as too strongly held by the Germans. According to one character, Navarone has the reputation of being ‚Äúa grim, impregnable iron fortress.‚ÄùMacLean, 8, 13; Rogers, 12. In the novel, the Germans refuse to accept the British occupation of the islands. The Sporades have little strategic importance. However, neutral Turkey is close by, and Germany cannot afford to appear weak in the eyes of the Turks. Elite German parachutists and mountain troops attack the British garrisons, as German dive bombers harry the enemy -- the German hold absolute air supremacy in the Aegean. The British lose over 10,000 men during the onslaught. The Germans retake every island, with one exception. A British garrison of 1,200 men still holds out on Kheros. In November, near Athens, the Germans assemble an invasion fleet of ca√Øques and E-Boats for the capture of Kheros. German air units, based on Samos, will support the fleet. MacLean mixes fact with fiction by referring to the fictional island of Kheros and the real island of Samos and the real city of Athens.MacLean, 8, 12, 13, 14, 159, 199, 212. This aspect of the novel closely resembles the real campaign in the Dodecanese. The British did indeed try to wrest control of the islands from the Germans in 1943. The campaign included several elements mentioned in the novel, such as the British use of the SBS and the German use of paratroops and dive bombers. At the height of the campaign, a German invasion force fought and won a pitched battle for the British-held island of Leros.See Anthony Rogers, Churchill‚Äôs Folly: Leros and the Aegean, The Last Great British Defeat of World War Two (London: Cassel, 2003), for an account of the campaign in the Dodecanese. MacLean uses his fictional version of the eastern Aegean to establish a premise of the novel, that the men on Kheros can be relieved only by going past Navarone. In order to save the Kheros garrison, the British Royal Navy organizes a squadron to steam north to Kheros. The ships have to reach the island and get back to base in a single night in order to avoid German air attack. As transport ships and tenders are too slow, the British can only use destroyers. Moving through the Lerades would be too dangerous because the Germans had mined the narrow passages, and going around the northern tip of the island group would take too much time. Hugging the Turkish coast would endanger diplomatic relations with Turkey. Because of these considerations, the British squadron can only take one passage, the clear channel between Maidos and Navarone.MacLean, 15, 16. The guns of Navarone However, the Germans had taken steps to ensure that such a move would be virtually suicidal. In the fortress cave overlooking the town of Navarone, they install two powerful artillery pieces. These are the ‚Äúguns of Navarone,‚Äù the object of the raid that drives the plot of the novel. One character who sees them estimates that they are at least 12 inch guns. This artillery is radar-controlled, with the aid of two large scanners atop the fortress. The Germans enlarge the cave by blasting out volcanic rock from the rear of the formation. They install turntables for the guns and lift shafts for hoisting shells. In the fortress -- the walls of which they topped with spikes and barbed wire -- they build barrack blocks, a powerhouse, an ordnance depot, a garage, a water storage tank, magazines, senior officers quarters, and a ferro-concrete control tower for the guns. Twin rows of anti-aircraft guns protect the main battery. Searchlights and mortar and machine gun emplacements dominate each side of the harbor mouth. The heavy artillery battery dominates the Maidos channel. When the British 8-inch cruiser Sybaris tries to run the gauntlet in July, she is quickly sunk. MacLean, 9, 16, 198, 234-235, 262-263, 266-268, 286. In addition to the installations in Navarone town, the novel has the Germans spread troops and set up checkpoints throughout the island. They maintain roadblocks on Navarone's only two roads. An important garrison holds Margaritha. The German compound includes a hut for the enlisted men and separate quarters for officers, and is surrounded by a barbed wire fence ten feet high. A guard post covers the head of the valley north of Margaritha.MacLean, 149. Allied attacks on the guns The novel lists several British efforts to neutralize the guns. In September, commandos, including some from the Royal Marines, and SBS troops launch a large scale amphibious attack on Navarone. They are massacred. Twice in late October and early November, SBS teams parachute into the island. They are never heard from again. The Royal Air Force sends a squadron of Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers to attack the guns, but the cave overhang thwarts the attempt.MacLean, 17, 198. These failures set the scene for the final attempt that is the subject of The Guns of Navarone. In November 1943, a small Allied unit of saboteurs launches a last-ditch attack on the guns, only a short time ahead of the German invasion of Kheros. Landing on the south coast, the Allied troops scale the high cliff, make their way to Navarone town, and demolish the German heavy guns with explosives. The coup leaves the way clear for the British naval squadron, led by the modern S-class destroyer H.M.S. Sirdar, to steam north and rescue the garrison on Kheros.MacLean, 8, 88, 217, 225, 284, 288. After The Guns of Navarone Navarone does not appear in, but is mentioned by name in the titles of, Force 10 from Navarone and its film adaptation; it likewise does not appear in MacLean's novelization of the film Partisans. The 1961 parody \\"The Guns of Abalone\\" on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show supposes that communist forces (Pottsylvanian spy Boris Badenov) took over the island, here with the thinly veiled pun name of \\"Abalone,\\" and reactivated the cannons, and that the original team that had shut down the guns in 1943 randomly recruited Bullwinkle J. Moose to shut them back down. Notes References *Blau, George E. The German Campaign in the Balkans (Spring 1941).

He also mentions \\"a masonry well, 25 fathoms deep, of good water\\" in the area.
