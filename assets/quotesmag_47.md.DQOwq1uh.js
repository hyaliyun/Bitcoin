Life Umphelby was born and died in London. She wrote The Child's Guide to Knowledge, ... by a Lady, but her fame is due to her nephew's intercession in adding her biography to the DNB.Susan Drain, ‘Umphelby, Fanny (1788–1852)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Nov 2014 The 1900 Dictionary of National Biography indicates that on publication in 1825 it \\"became at once a standard\\" book in the classroom. The book was first published as 262 Questions and Answers, with the modest attribution \\"by a Lady\\", but was later retitled in full The Child's Guide to Knowledge; Being a Collection of Useful and Familiar Questions and Answers on Every-day Subjects, Adapted for Young Persons, and Arranged in the Most Simple and Easy Language. The coy attribution caused some confusion as to authorship, with her sister, the wife of Robert Ward, often being credited for early editions of the work, although by 1900 the Dictionary of National Biography was prepared to positively assert that Umphelby was the sole original author. By 1899, The Child's Guide to Knowledge was in its 58th edition, with later editions having been updated by her nephew, Robert A. Ward. Encyclopedias for children in varying subjects were in vogue in the early 19th century. The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature (1984) indicates that The Child's Guide to Knowledge, ... by a Lady was modeled on William Pinnock's Catechisms and Richmal Mangnall's Miscellaneous Questions for the Use of Young People. Umphelby utilized the techniques of the Elucidarium, a 12th-century encyclopedia that presented information as a Socratic dialogue between a teacher and his disciple, but varied the formula to have the pupil present the information instead of the teacher. The book caused a resurgence of popularity around books based on dialogue. Umphelby also authored A Guide to Jewish History.

The monument measures high and wide. The orthostats (upright stones) measure up to in height around a tightly closed interior chamber. The capstones lie at a nearly horizontal angle. The interior chamber is accessed by a keyhole entrance at ground level, in width, which may suggest spiritual offerings were placed inside the structure in ancient times.

An up-growth of vines and other plants rises over the base of the doorstone at the front, and encloses the rear of the structure. Use Vines grow over the doorstone It is unclear exactly what the tomb was used for. It could have been the burial site of a Déisi chieftain from the nearby area, or it could have served a spiritual purpose. It has been noted that the entrance of the tomb aligns with the Sugarloaf hill to the northwest. This gives rise to the possibility of solar and lunar alignments during summer solstice and full moon cycles of the start and middle of the year. The site could also have been employed by local shamans or druids for various spiritual rituals. Knockeen Portal Tomb is under state care as it is a listed national monument, number 421.

During a routine flight from Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador to Mont-Joli, Quebec, a combination of inclement weather and a mapping error caused the Liberator to collide with the Black Mountain (French: Montagne Noire), killing all those on board. The wreckage was discovered accidentally more than two years later. Today, a hiking trail leads to the site where remains of the aircraft can still be seen along with numerous plaques detailing the accident and a monument honouring those who died.  Aircraft  The lost aircraft, Consolidated Liberator III (B-24D) serial number 41-24236, was purchased in September 1942 from the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as part of a four aircraft order. Once in RCAF service, the aircraft received the tail number 3701H and was to be used by No. 10 Squadron RCAF for anti-submarine warfare (ASW). However, it was deemed that the four aircraft were not capable of the ASW mission, so they were employed for training and general transport.  Accident  On 19 October 1943, bad weather conditions had kept all aircraft at Gander Airport grounded until 22:16 hours when the accident aircraft finally received authorization to leave on a routine flight to Mont-Joli Airport with a crew of 4 and 20 passengers, reportedly proceeding on leave. After about three hours in the air, at 01:45 the pilot made contact with Mont-Joli Airport control tower to ask for authorization to land, only to be notified that the landing strip was closed due to the weather and diverted the aircraft to Rockcliffe Airport, Ontario or Dorval airport, Montreal, Québec. Besides a call for help reportedly heard by another aircraft flying near Grand-Mère, Quebec, no other contact was made with the Liberator. An RCAF Liberator GR.VIII (B-24J) similar to the accident aircraft, depicted on a plaque at the accident site  Search for the wreckage  On the night of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers remember hearing the noise of a large aircraft passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in fire tower number four at Archambault lake, did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but thought of it as the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, Mr. Moore went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible. As soon as the aircraft's disappearance was noted, Canada's eastern aerial command conducted searches along the planned route of the Liberator. After 728 sorties for a total of 2,438 flight hours between 20 October and 26 November, the search was called off by the RCAF. For almost three years the disappearance of Liberator Harry remained a mystery, with the most plausible theory explaining failures to locate the aircraft was that it was lying at the bottom of the Saint-Lawrence river.  Discovery of the wreckage  The rear turret On 20 June 1946, while searching for another aircraft that had been reported as missing between Rockcliffe and Roberval, Quebec, the crew of a military search aircraft, piloted by Lt. B.D. Inrig, noticed a glint of sunshine coming from a metallic object and on closer investigation saw the characteristic twin fins of a Liberator near the top of the mountain. All records pointed to it being the lost aircraft. That same day, a search party was formed and dispatched to the site under the command of Captain Harry Cobb RCAF. With no access to the site, the group had to trail- blaze its way through the forest guided by an observation plane which would nose dive to indicate the location of the wreckage. According to Cobb's testimony, all passengers were killed on impact, which was also confirmed by Dr. J.-A. Melançon, the coroner, who reported the deaths as being accidental. The aircraft had caught fire with only some assemblies, the rear fuselage and the engines having been spared by the blaze. Of the crew and passengers, only three bodies could be identified.  Cause  At an altitude of , the Black Mountain (La Montagne Noire) is the highest point of the region of Saint- Donat. While the exact cause of the accident is still unknown, it was later discovered that its height was not correctly reported on contemporary navigation maps. Given the poor weather conditions on the night of the crash, it is very likely that the pilot noticed the mountain too late to climb away from it.  Commemoration  Not very long after the discovery of the wreckage, the debris was gathered into piles. The matter of bringing the remains of the lost soldiers out from the scene for burial in Ottawa was discussed at length between military authorities, and in the end it was decided that they should remain in place due to the impossibility of identifying all of them. In the afternoon of 3 July 1946, friends and family of the crew and passengers along with many members of the RCAF and religious authorities climbed the mountain to pay their respects to the dead and hold a funeral. Three religious services were held on that afternoon: Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. A plaque displaying the names of the victims was installed on the rock at the foot of which the remains were buried. For several years, the site would be maintained by local men paid on a small budget given by the Canadian Armed Forces. During the summer of 1985, after having been notified of a desecration, the Canadian branch of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission decided to move the remains to the parish cemetery in Saint-Donat. There, a monument was erected to display the names of the victims along with a commemorative plaque. On 30 June 1996, 50 years after the tragedy, a service attended by veterans of the 10 BR and locals was held at the crash site with flyovers by the Snowbirds. A funerary obelisk produced by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and dedicated to the 24 soldiers was also unveiled in the cemetery in Saint-Donat where the remains were now buried. Crash site monument as seen from the observation tower A different view of the site Owing to the increasing number of visits the site was getting, partly due to its fame but also because the InterCentre trail was passing through, it was decided that it had to be reorganized in a more sustainable way. In the summer of 2000, work was undertaken to build stairs and a flag pole, and install informative plaques. Crosses for each of the victims were put in place and a small cenotaph was erected. The cenotaph lists on its sides the rank and name of each deceased person and has on its front a pictograph of the ill-fated plane and the following text: On 15 June 2013, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the accident, a ceremony was held at the site with military music and flyovers of a CF-18 from the RCAF. In anticipation of this day and in order to make the site more accessible to less capable hikers, the path to the monument was improved, allowing it to be reached in less than 3 hours by foot from a parking lot at the bottom of the mountain. On 29–30 September 2018, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the tragedy, a ceremony was held on the crash site itself the first day and at the Saint-Donat cemetery the next day.

Nader having recently concluded a successful campaign against his own monarch and prince, the badly humiliated Tahmasp II, set out from Mashad on May 4, 1729 making sure the Shah also accompanied him on this journey where he could be kept under close supervision. The conflict also bears significance in terms of the effects of Nader's army perfecting its tactical system through experience gained from going up against deadly light cavalry armies, something that would prove of incalculable importance in the battle of Mihmandoost (where the Afghans were given a rude introduction to modern warfare by Nader's well-drilled army).  Background of the Campaign  The Abdali forces consisted of 15,000 riders under Allahyar Khan, the governor of Herat, concentrated around Kafer Qal'eh and another detachment of 12,000 men led by an impetuous commander by the name of Zulfaqar Khan which was approaching kafer Qal'eh from the south. In the ensuing ebb and flow of marches and counter marches where dozens of skirmishes, charges, feints, ruses and retreats Nader would find himself hard-pressed to keep the upper hand in a constantly changing battlefield environment where even the weather would prove unpredictable.  The Road to Herat  The battle of Kafer Qal'eh resulted in a tactical victory for Nader after which Allahyar Khan was pursued and re- engaged. At the height of the battle Nader's scouts brought word of Zulfaqar Khans approach prompting Nader to carry out an ingenious ruse. A column of Persian troops was sent on a march round Allahyar Khan's army with their victory drums & horns sounding loudly which led him to believe that Zulfaqar Khan's men had already been defeated forcing him to beat another hasty retreat.Ghafouri, Ali(2008). History of Iran's wars: from the Medes to now,p. 371. Etela'at Publishing As Allahyar broke away towards Herat Nader dispatched a portion of his army to pursue him but kept the bulk of his men to turn and face the fresh troops under Zulfaqar khan's command, however before Nader engaged Zulfaqar's contingent a sandstorm swept into the area rendering any further fighting all but impossible, thereby providing a cover under which the Abdali forces managed to withdraw towards Herat unmolested. The entire campaign thus far had been a chain of skirmishes, marches and counter marches where Nader excelled as a quick thinking commander who outwitted his foes at every corner despite at times seemingly caught in near impossible situations such as when news of Zulfaqar's imminent arrival reached him when he was already heavily engaged with Allahyar Khan's men. The impressive campaign however did not result in the Abdali's destruction and Nader followed their retreat eastward until he came in view of Herat where the combined forces of Allahyar & Zulfaqar rode out to meet him in a finale to the campaign.  Subjugation of Herat  When battle was joined for the final time in view of Herat itself the action was uncannily similar to the previous engagements between the Persians and the Abdalis except that on this particular occasion the frontal charge of the Abdalis was firmly halted by muskets of the Persian line infantry crashing out simultaneously breaking the impetus of the Afghans charge and providing adequate persuasion to the Abdalis to fall behind the city walls. Herat now came under an intense bombardment from the Persian guns and mortars, convincing the governor of Herat, Allahyar Khan, to sue for peace in exchange for recognition of Persia as suzerain of Herat.

It is alleged many of these activities are undertaken at the direction and under the control of, the North Korean government and the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, with their proceeds going towards advancing the country's nuclear and conventional arms production, funding the lifestyles of the country's elite, and propping up the North Korean economy. Overview Unlike criminal syndicates, the extensive nature of these illegal endeavors, and the claim that they are directed and sanctioned by the highest levels of government, has led to the nature of the North Korean state being defined as a form of \\"criminal sovereignty\\" by Paul Rexton Kan and Bruce Bechtol. However, there are questions remaining about the level of government involvement in each of the criminal enterprises. Many commentators agree that the North Korean state has been behind counterfeiting currency, human trafficking, the arms trade, etc., but the level to which it has been involved in the drug trade after the collapse of the Public Distribution System in the 1990s is not clear as semi-private and private black markets have arisen since then and some high-ranking officials may only be engaged in illicit trade for personal benefit. =Critical assessment= The British academic, Hazel Smith, has argued that the allegations have a weak foundation, being largely based on the claims of a few US officials and North Korean defectors. She has pointed out that there have been very few criminal convictions. She has queried the assumption that all the activities are directed by North Korea's government. According to North Korea scholar Andrei Lankov, the country's illicit activities never developed into lucrative hard currency earners. Instead, these activities exposed the country to international condemnation in exchange for marginal gain. Lankov suggests that smuggling was never intended to earn currency for the regime, but was simply a means of survival for diplomats whose funding was cut. Drug trade It is alleged that North Korea's illegal drug trade dates back to the 1970s and includes the manufacturing, selling, and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as counterfeit otherwise legal pharmaceuticals. Production began in the mountainous Hamkyung and Yangkang Provinces, particularly in the village of Yonsah, where Kim Il-sung sanctioned the creation of an opium farm. To provide a cover of legitimacy, the North Korean government uses front companies, like the Ryugyong Corporation under the control of the Korean Workers Party's Foreign Relations Department, to conduct clandestine activities. The company also holds large tracts of land within the country for the sole purpose of growing opium and each year the company sent tens of thousands of dollars in hard currency to Kim Jong-il for his use. Unlike most companies, Ryugyong Corporation has no import or export quota restrictions. According to defector Yoon Yong-sol, during the famine \\"[t]here were some complaints that during the famine we should be growing grain, not poppies, but the instruction from the central government was that if we grow poppies we can sell the product for 10 times as much to buy grain. ... The only way to earn hard currency is by drugs.\\" Reports of methamphetamine (known as \\"ice drug\\" in North Korea) use in the country surfaced in the late 1990s. According to Isaac Stone Fish writing in Foreign Policy, the production of methamphetamine in North Korea is done by chemists and other underemployed scientists. Methamphetamine is often taken as a \\"medication\\" within North Korea, which has helped to fuel its spread. As the production and sale of opium declined in the mid-2000s, methamphetamine became more pervasive. To bring in much-needed cash, the international methamphetamine trade began, spreading first to China, and with the drug being made in state-run laboratories. However, Isaac Stone Fish admitted with regard to his report: \\"I have no idea what is actually happening inside North Korea\\". China officially admitted to the drug problem stemming from North Korea in 2004, with Jilin Province being the most important transhipment point from North Korea. The production, storage, financing, and sale of the North Korea's methamphetamine trade reaches multiple countries from the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others. In 2010, five foreign nationals were prosecuted as part of a conspiracy involving North Korea to smuggle 40 pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and to sell it for $30,000 a pound. In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion. In a 2013 Washington Post article, annual revenues from methamphetamine sales are estimated at $100 million to $200 million. Between 1977 and 2003, more than twenty North Korean diplomats, agents, and trade officials have been implicated, detained, or arrested in drug-smuggling operations in more than a dozen countries. In 2004, two North Korean embassy employees were caught smuggling 150,000 tablets of clonazepam in Egypt, and in that same year, embassy employees from Bulgaria were arrested in Turkey in possession of over 500,000 tablets of Captagon (the brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, or phenethylline), with an estimated street value of $7 million. The government of North Korea has only admitted that individuals undertook such acts, and not at the direction of the state. According to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, since 2001 drug trafficking operations by diplomats had ceased, with the focus then becoming the production of drugs to be smuggled by other criminal organizations. In 2003, the North Korean owned cargo ship Pong Su was intercepted importing heroin into Australia. While four men who had landed pleaded guilty, the ship's four officers were acquitted on all charges. Counterfeiting =Currency= Counterfeiting currency is alleged to have begun in the 1970s under Kim Jong-il's direction; however, the notes produced at the time were not of high quality. Since then, and within the jurisdiction of Room 39, the North Korean government has counterfeited $50 and $100 United States banknotes using increasingly sophisticated techniques. In 1994, authorities in Hong Kong and Macao apprehended five North Korean diplomats and trade-mission members carrying around $430,000 in bills that turned out to be \\"superdollar\\" (also called \\"supernote\\") counterfeits. There have been two primary reasons for counterfeiting: the first is to wage economic warfare against the United States, and secondly, to help ease North Korea's domestic economic problems. According to a report by Dr. Balbina Hwang of American University, North Korea circulated $100 million in counterfeit currency in 2001. The revenues from this are estimated at between $15 million and $25 million annually. In 2013, the United States released its newly redesigned 100 dollar bill. The primary purpose of the redesign was to fight against counterfeiting and prevent the recurrence of the \\"supernotes\\" which were produced by North Korea. The International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency is the primary treaty whereby states agree to criminalize acts of currency counterfeiting. North Korea is not a party to the treaty. Analyst Andrei Lankov has described the evidence for the counterfeiting of superdollars as merely circumstantial. Gregory Elich of the Korea Policy Institute has argued that these allegations are unfounded. According to Elich, North Korea's intaglio press from the 1970s would be incapable of printing the supernotes, and the paper and ink would be extremely difficult for North Korea to produce. Furthermore, he says that the amounts of supernotes produced are too small to be economical. =Counterfeit legal pharmaceuticals= There have been a few cases of North Korea being implicated in the production of counterfeit Viagra. These include: a 2004 arrest in Seoul, South Korea of a man with 4,000 counterfeit Viagra pills; and a 2005 report from Japan that North Korea was producing fake Viagra pills in factories in Chongjin, which were then sold in Hong Kong to customers of other Southeast-Asian countries (including China), and the Middle East. =Counterfeit cigarettes= Counterfeit cigarettes have been a lucrative item for the country. The trade is believed to have begun in the 1990s and greatly increased in 2002 after Chinese authorities shut down many counterfeit operations in China, which then provided added incentive, knowledge, and capacity which could be relocated to North Korea. During a 2006 Congressional hearing, Peter A. Prahar of the Department of State, quoted reports that mentioned the existence of \\"as many as 12\\" factories in North Korea capable of producing \\"billions of packs of counterfeit cigarettes annually.\\" The factories appear to be owned and operated by the North Korean military. The major factories for cigarette production were reportedly based in Rason, though defectors also mentioned a factory in Pyongyang. In 1995, Taiwan stopped a ship and confiscated 20 containers of counterfeit cigarette packaging, which is enough to make 2 million cartons of popular Japanese and British brands. In 2004, authorities in Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Singapore also impounded containers filled with counterfeit cigarettes. Official congressional testimony in 2006 revealed that North Korea-sourced Marlboro brand cigarettes had been identified in 1,300 incidents across the United States. Revenues from counterfeit cigarettes are estimated at between $80 million and $160 million a year. Human trafficking North Korea is a \\"Tier 3\\" country (those who do not comply with human trafficking laws) as listed by the U.S. Department of State and has retained this ranking since 2007. The country is a source country of men, women, and children for sex trafficking and forced labor. Forced labor is used both internally and externally. Countries which have North Korean forced laborers include Poland, Malta, Russia, China, Mongolia, and other places in Central Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. While the North Korean government claims these are \\"contract workers\\", reports claim that they are actually subjected to forced labor, that their movements and communications are subjected to strict surveillance, and that workers sent overseas do not have a choice in the type of work they will be doing nor do they receive pay for their work. It is estimated that there are thousands of North Koreans working in logging, construction, and agriculture industries in Russia. These workers reportedly only receive two days of rest each year and face punishment if they fail to meet quotas. North Korea is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. Arms trade During the 1980s, North Korea emerged as a legal arms trader to primarily Third World countries, exporting relatively inexpensive, technically unsophisticated, but reliable weapons. During the Iran–Iraq War, some 90% of arms exports from North Korea went to Iran, and between 1981 and 1989, North Korea earned an estimated $4 billion from arms sales. North Korea has a known track record in proliferating nuclear and missile technology and in 2001, missile sales came to $560 million. Following its 2006 nuclear test, international sanctions have sought to limit or prevent North Korea from exporting various types of arms, materials, and technology. Prior to UN sanctions however, countries such as Japan and the United States took unilateral steps to curb such activities. UN sanctions now ban all arms, including small arms and light weapons. North Korea has developed an extensive and complicated arms trade network in an attempt to circumvent sanctions and uses front companies and embassies to traffic weapons. In a 2014 UN report, Syria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Somalia and Iran were all suspected to have bought weapons from North Korea. =Incidents= , trade in banned small arms and ammunition was relatively insignificant. Reports include: imports totaling $45,500 by Brazil in 2007, $3.1 million by the United Arab Emirates in 2006, $364,400 by Ethiopia in 2005, and $121,400 by Mexico in 2005. In 2009, three vessels were intercepted which were carrying North Korean weapons. Western and Israeli intelligence officials believed the weapons were destined for Hezbollah and Hamas. In December 2009, Thailand intercepted a charter jet from Pyongyang carrying 35 tons of conventional weapons, including surface-to-air missiles. In 2012, the United Nations reported that 445 North Korean-made graphite cylinders (which can be used to produce ballistic missiles) were seized from a Chinese freighter at the South Korean port of Busan on their way to Syria. In 2013, a North Korean cargo ship seizure in Panama (carrying Cuban weapons) took place. In August 2016, US intelligence tracked a ship sailing under a convenience flag of Cambodia, with a North Korean crew sailing from North Korea to Egypt was found with carrying 24,000 rocket-propelled grenades and components for another 6,000. It was ordered and paid by a private Egyptian business, but it is believed that it was for the Egyptian Army. The value of this order and others is estimated at $23 million.  Wildlife trade  Over the past three decades, at least 18 North Korean diplomats have been caught smuggling rhino horn and ivory, though the real number is considered to be much higher. North Korean defectors have also reported smuggling of rhino horn and ivory from countries like Angola, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa and Mozambique. Such illegal activity is considered low-risk but highly rewarding for the regime.  Evading sanctions  According to the United Nations Panel of Experts in April 2019, North Korea had developed a number of techniques and a complex web of organisations to enable it to evade the sanctions against it, particularly with regard to coal and oil. The techniques included falsification of documents and covert ship-to-ship transfers of cargo at sea. In May 2019, the United States announced it had seized a North Korean cargo vessel for carrying a coal shipment in defiance of sanctions. The Justice Department said the 17,061-tonne Wise Honest is one of the North's largest cargo ships and it was first detained by Indonesia in April 2018 but is now in the possession of the United States. Room 39 Room 39 (or Office 39) is the primary government organization that seeks ways to maintain the foreign currency slush fund of North Korea's leader. Room 39 oversees many of the government's illegal activities (although the military also has its own illegal activity division) such as counterfeiting and drug production. In 2010, the department was reported to have had 17 overseas branches, 100 trading companies and banks under its control. By 2009, the office allegedly had upwards of $5 billion in assets, much of which was spread in banks throughout Macau, Hong Kong, and Europe. In August 2014, Yun Tae-hyong, a senior representative of North Korea's Korea Daesong Bank, which is suspected of being under control of Room 39, was reported to have defected to Russia taking $5 million with him. In 2015, the European Union placed the Korean National Insurance Company (KNIC) under sanctions and added that the KNIC had links to Room 39. The KNIC (which had offices in Hamburg, Germany and London, United Kingdom) was reported to have had assets of UK£787 million in 2014 and had been involved in scamming insurance markets and making investments in property and foreign exchange. Politically motivated actions As well as illegal money-making ventures, North Korea has been condemned for politically motivated criminal acts related to the long-running Korean conflict. =Terrorism= In 1988, North Korea was added to the State Sponsors of Terrorism list for supplying groups with weapons and for their role in the Rangoon bombing and the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858. In 2008 President George W. Bush agreed to remove North Korea from the list after North Korea met their obligations to provide access to their nuclear program and the resumption of disabling of their nuclear facilities, but continued hostilities and the fear that North Korea could sell nuclear weapons to terrorist organisations have called for the nation to be relisted. In 2017, North Korea was relisted as a terrorist state in response to the murder of Kim Jong-nam, its role in the Syrian Civil War, close relationships with Iran, and it backing Islamic terrorist organizations, especially Hamas.Trump Returns North Korea to List of State Sponsors of Terrorism (The New York Times) =International abductions= Between 1977 and 1983, North Korea abducted several Japanese citizens. North Korea has admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens, and Japan lists 17 as having been abducted. There are also testimonies which list nine Europeans as being abducted by North Korea. The purposes of abduction ranges from using the abductees as translators/teachers, to become wives, and to obtain identities for other clandestine operations. During the Korean War North Korea abducted an estimated 82,959 South Koreans, and in the post-war period South Korea claims that a further 489 South Koreans have been abducted by North Korea. =Hacking= According to cybersecurity experts, North Korea maintains an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal both money and sensitive data. In the previous decade, it was blamed for numerous cyber-attacks and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere. After the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, U.S. government officials stated that the North Korean government was \\"centrally involved\\" in the hacking. White House officials treated the situation as a \\"serious national security matter\\", and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) formally stated that they had connected the North Korean government to the cyber-attack. Hacking has also emerged as an important source of income for North Korea. Although all estimates are considered rough, it is understood that thousands of hackers rake in hundreds of millions of dollars each year. This would make hacking a bigger source of income than weapons sales and related military services. Targets include foreign banks, microtransactions, and cryptocurrencies, from which money is first stolen and subsequently laundered. On 8 October 2018, Bloomberg reported a North Korean hacking group had tried to steal at least $1.1 billion in a series of attacks on global banks from 2014–2018, as uncovered by cybersecurity company FireEye. International responses The United Nations Security Council has passed multiple resolutions against North Korea and its weapons program including, UNSC Resolution 825 (May 1993), UNSC Resolution 1695 (July 2006), UNSC 1874 (June 2009), UNSC Resolution 2094 (March 2013) and most recently, UNSC Resolution 2371 (August 2017). Were the international community to fully enforce UNSC 1874, it is estimated that North Korea would lose between $1.5 and $3.7 billion. Since 1950, the United States has maintained an embargo against North Korea for their role in starting the Korean War. The embargo and related sanctions have been extended to combat North Korea's various illicit activities and continued aggression. In 2005, under the US Patriot Act section 311, $25 million of North Korea's cash was frozen at Macau-based Banco Delta Asia, which the US Treasury said North Korea used for illicit activities. In 2010, US President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13551, which \\"targets North Korea’s importation and exportation of arms, importation of luxury goods, and other illicit activities, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking.\\" See also * Kippumjo * Human experimentation in North Korea * Corruption in North Korea General: * Economy of North Korea * Crime in North Korea * Mafia state References Further reading Category:Human rights in North Korea Category:Nuclear proliferation Category:Illegal drug trade Category:Terrorism Category:Foreign relations of North Korea Category:Crime in North Korea Category:Economy of North Korea ","title":"North Korea's illicit activities"},{"id":"43742769","text":"Intiqam Kamil oglu Aliyev (sometimes also spelled Intigam) (born 30 November 1962, Pushkin (now Bilasuvar), Azerbaijan SSR) is a human rights defender and lawyer in Azerbaijan.

Even though it appears implicitly in earlier work of Shelah, tameness as a property of AEC was first isolated by Grossberg and VanDieren,. who observed that tame AECs were much easier to handle than general AECs.  Definition  Let K be an AEC with joint embedding, amalgamation, and no maximal models. Just like in first- order model theory, this implies K has a universal model-homogeneous monster model \\\\mathfrak{C}. Working inside \\\\mathfrak{C}, we can define a semantic notion of types by specifying that two elements a and b have the same type over some base model M if there is an automorphism of the monster model sending a to b fixing M pointwise (note that types can be defined in a similar manner without using a monster model, Definition II.1.9.). Such types are called Galois types. One can ask for such types to be determined by their restriction on a small domain. This gives rise to the notion of tameness: * An AEC K is tame if there exists a cardinal \\\\kappa such that any two distinct Galois types are already distinct on a submodel of their domain of size \\\\le \\\\kappa. When we want to emphasize \\\\kappa, we say K is \\\\kappa-tame. Tame AECs are usually also assumed to satisfy amalgamation.  Discussion and motivation  While (without the existence of large cardinals) there are examples of non- tame AECs,. most of the known natural examples are tame.See the discussion in the introduction of . In addition, the following sufficient conditions for a class to be tame are known: * Tameness is a large cardinal axiom:, Theorem 1.3. There are class-many almost strongly compact cardinals iff any abstract elementary class is tame. * Some tameness follows from categoricity:, Main claim 2.3 (9.2 in the online version). If an AEC with amalgamation is categorical in a cardinal \\\\lambda of high-enough cofinality, then tameness holds for types over saturated models of size less than \\\\lambda. * Conjecture 1.5 in .: If K is categorical in some λ ≥ Hanf(K) then there exists χ < Hanf(K) such that K is χ-tame. Many results in the model theory of (general) AECs assume weak forms of the Generalized continuum hypothesis and rely on sophisticated combinatorial set-theoretic arguments.See for example many of the hard theorems of Shelah's book (). On the other hand, the model theory of tame AECs is much easier to develop, as evidenced by the results presented below.  Results  The following are some important results about tame AECs. * Upward categoricity transfer:. A \\\\kappa-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in some successor \\\\lambda \\\\ge \\\\operatorname{LS}(K)^{++} + \\\\kappa^+ (i.e. has exactly one model of size \\\\lambda up to isomorphism) is categorical in all \\\\mu \\\\ge \\\\lambda. * Upward stability transfer:See , Theorem 4.5 for the first result and for the second. A \\\\kappa-tame AEC with amalgamation that is stable in a cardinal \\\\lambda \\\\ge \\\\kappa is stable in \\\\lambda^+ and in every infinite \\\\mu such that \\\\mu^\\\\lambda = \\\\mu. * Tameness can be seen as a topological separation principle:, Proposition 4.1. An AEC with amalgamation is tame if and only if an appropriate topology on the set of Galois types is Hausdorff. * Tameness and categoricity imply there is a forking notion:See for the first result, and , Corollary 6.10.5 for the result on dimension. A \\\\kappa-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in a cardinal \\\\lambda of cofinality greater than or equal to \\\\kappa has a good frame: a forking-like notion for types of singletons (in particular, it is stable in all cardinals). This gives rise to a well-behaved notion of dimension. Notes References    * *Boney, Will; Unger Spencer (2015), \\"Large Cardinal Axioms from Tameness in AECs\\" arXiv:1509.01191v2.

She worked with the famous Hull House community of social reformers, including Jane Addams, Julia Lathrop, Alice De Wolf Kellogg, and Ellen Gates Starr. She advocated for major school administration reform, exposing corruption, advocating for more democratic decision-making, and defending the unionization of teachers. Early life and education De Bey was born in the Dutch seaport town of Groningen. Her father, Dr. Bernardus B. De Bey, was a minister and a professor at the University of Groningen. In 1868, when Cornelia was three years old, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois, so that Bernardus could serve as minister to the First Reformed Church of Chicago, a Dutch congregation. De Bey remained in Chicago for the remainder of her life, immersing herself in the politics of the Progressive Era in Chicago. De Bey received her education at Cook County Normal School, a teacher-training school in Illinois responsible for training Chicago's teachers. She then pursued her medical degree at the Hahnemannian Medical College in Chicago. After graduating in 1895, she began working with Jane Addams at Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago that serviced many people and neighborhoods in Chicago. Reform work and The Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) Dr. Cornelia De Bey De Bey was involved in the Settlement House Movement, a reform movement which prioritized women's involvement in Progressive Era reforms. Women working in the settlement movement in the United States focused on education, cleanliness and health awareness, as well as providing daycare for working mothers. Many women taught adult-education classes to immigrants. De Bey was also involved in the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), a reform movement led by Progressive-Era women including Jane Addams. This organization was strongly feminist, and was closely tied with the Settlement House Movement. The WTUL worked to establish the eight-hour workday and a minimum wage, as well as the abolition of child labor. The leaders and members supported the female garment industry workers during the garment industry strikes between 1910 and 1911. De Bey and other members of the Settlement House Movement were involved in the WTUL and other Progressive Era Reform movements because they were educated middle and upper- middle class women, and they felt morally responsible for helping others that were less fortunate than them. Later years De Bey moved to California in 1927 when she retired, then returning to Michigan where she died in 1948. She was buried in Holland, Michigan at the Pilgrim Home Cemetery.

History =The original church= The church dates back to the 17th century. The 2nd Earl of Mulgrave purchased the land in 1629, and the main contributor to the building fund (£700) was the wealthy merchant Sir Nicholas Crispe, who had lived since 1625 in a house on the riverside in Hammersmith. The foundation stone was laid on 11 March 1630, and the chapel of ease was consecrated by Archbishop Laud on 7 June 1631. =The present church= Hammersmith was developing rapidly, helped by the arrival of the new Metropolitan Railway. At a public meeting held on 20 January 1880, the decision was taken to rebuild the church on the same site. It was felt that the building was no longer big enough to accommodate the growing population and 'The old unsightly structure is not worthy of being the chief witness to God in the midst of such an important Metropolitan Suburb as Hammersmith has now become.' In July 1882 the Duke of Albany laid the foundation stone, and the nave of the new church was consecrated on 13 October 1883. The architects were J. P. Seddon and H. R. Gough. Like St Peter's Church in Hammersmith, St Paul's lost a significant portion of its land, including that with graves, when Hammersmith Flyover and the Great West Road were built in 1957–61. Hammersmith Chess Club briefly used the Church Hall as their home venue from 1970 to 1975, before later moving on to Blythe House. In 1983, the church pews were removed and replaced with more flexible seating. In the 2000s, an extension was built onto the western end of the church, incorporating a new hall and kitchen, and accompanied by a major restoration programme. The work was done by Bryen & Langley and the extension was opened in 2011. The church has strong ties with the nearby Latymer Upper School, which gathers at the church on its Founder's Day each year. Exterior The church is designed in the Early English Gothic Style, with lancet windows, powerful buttresses, a high roof and an imposing tower. Interior Interior of St Paul's Hammersmith (taken during restoration work) The internal dimensions of St Paul's Church are: length 190 ft (57.9m), width 73 ft (22.25 m), height 63 ft (19.2m). It was designed to seat 1,400 people. The walls are of brown Ancaster stone, with Belgian marble used for the clustered columns and wall-linings. There are six bays, formed by the five main columns on each side, with white and blue Bath stone used for the arches and some carved decoration. The most interesting feature inside the church is a bust of King Charles I, sculpted by Hubert Le Sueur and erected by Sir Nicholas Crispe. After the King's execution in 1649, the heart of Crispe, enclosed in a small urn, was placed below this monument. The inscription on the urn reads: In 1898 his body and heart were both moved to a new tomb. The pulpit came from the former church of All-Hallows-the-Great in the City of London. There is also a memorial to William Tierney Clark, designer of the first Hammersmith Bridge, in the church. The stained glass windows of the church were made by Clayton and Bell. Those on the north side depict the life of Saint Paul, the apostle of the Church; while those on the south side depict the life of Saint Peter, the other apostle who is usually paired with Paul.

Part of the Sony α family, it is one of Sony's \\"Smart Lens\\" cameras, alongside the QX10, QX30 and QX100, that are designed to be specifically used with a smartphone.

Features Sony ILCE-QX1 with flash extended. On the ILCE-QX1 itself, there are buttons for on/off, flash pop-up, lens release and shutter, which are enough for standalone shooting.

In its culminating stage the battle bears some resemblances to the battle of Sangan although it was both preceded and succeeded by numerous other minor skirmishes and engagements.  Background  A military diagram demonstrating the key manoeuvres in the campaign A previous incursion by Nader had resulted in the sacking of Sangan and a tactical victory against an Abdali army sent against him though he did not move to annex any new territory after his minor triumph and left for Mashad. his plans were disrupted when his Shah, Tahmasp II declared he was a traitor and forced him into a brief conflict which Nader won, establishing his authority over the prince. Having subdued all domestic challenges to himself Nader set out for his long overdue expedition against the Herat.  Battle  Heading out to meet Nader's invasion, Allahyar Khan came into contact with Nader 80 kilometres west of Herat at Kfer Qal'eh to find The Persian musketeers drawn up in line and flanked on either side by batteries of field artillery and the cavalry kept separate in reserve. Sending forward small detachments of cavalry to elicit a rash response by Allahyar Khan, Nader hoped to guide him under the combined fire of his line infantry and artillery. The Abdalis decided to oblige and broke out into a furious charge upon the Persian left flank which began to buckle under pressure, only saved, as in Sangan, by an equally zealous charge by the Persian reserve cavalry led by Nader who personally slew the Abdali commander leading the charge but himself sustained an injury to his leg. Although this counterattack did not rout the Abdali forces outright, it necessitated their withdrawal. The ferocity of the battle was such that both armies withdrew but by the light of dawn the next day it became apparent that Allahyar Khan was in a retreat eastwards.

The park features tennis courts, playscapes, swimming pool, splash pad, as well as the Delores Duffie Recreation Center and the Doris \\"Dorie\\" Miller Auditorium. Combined, they comprise a 31,500 square feet facility with a gymnasium. They offer year round classes, workshops, special events, tournaments, performances, and demonstrations. History The property in East Austin was originally the home site of Rudolph Bertram, a local store owner and namesake for the town of Bertram. In 1875, Bertram built the 14-room limestone block house on the property, which now functions as the Recreation Center. The house passed to his daughter Emmie and her husband, Charles Huppertz. Upon their passing, the city of Austin purchased the Bertram-Huppertz house and land in 1928 for the purpose of creating a segregated park for the African American community. In 1929, a playground and after-school program was established at the site. Throughout the 1930s, the city added tennis courts, a swimming pool, a bandstand, and baseball fields to the park. The Bertram-Huppertz house was at that time used as the athletic clubhouse and bath house. In 1944, the city started construction on Doris Miller Auditorium, named for Doris \\"Dorie\\" Miller, a native Texan and the first African American awarded the Navy Cross. In 1973, the historic Henry Green Madison cabin was re-assembled on the park property, after having been discovered on its original site on East 11th Street, framed within a larger house that was being demolished. In 1974 the cabin was named a State Historical Site by the Texas Historical Commission.

This small committee was the forerunner to the birth of NU organization. Origins Since Ibn Saud conquered Hejaz area (which includes Mecca and Medina) in around 1924 and became the first king of the monarch of Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism sect became the dominant sect in the area. Other Islamic groups were banned to teach their mazhabs, even some of their scholars were jailed or killed. The ban created a mass exodus of scholars from around the world who came to these places to study and teach. They moved or returned to their respective countries, including scholars from Indonesia. As initiative of Abdul Wahab Hasbullah, a small committee was formed to persuade and to submit some requests to Ibn Saud. The committee was under the approval of Hasyim Asy'ari. The members of the Committee were Wahab Habullah (advisor), Mashuri (advisor), Khalil (advisor), Hasan Gipo (chairman), Hasan Syamil (Vice Chairman), Muhammad Shadiq (Secretary), and Abdul Halim (Assistant). Activities The main tasks of the Committee were to deliver concerns, formulate opinions and sum up the sights of Ahlul Sunnah scholars regarding the issues to be delivered to the new Ruler of Saudi Arabia, to form a delegation to go to the Hejaz and to contact other Islamic scholars in Java and Madura. The first meeting was held on January 31, 1926 on Kertopaten street in Surabaya and attended by several Indonesian Ulama such as Hasyim Asy'ari, of Jombang, Asnawi of Kudus, Nawawi of Pasuruan, Ridwan of Semarang, Maksum of Lasem, Nahrawi of Malang, Ndoro Munthaha of Bangkalan, Hamid Faqih of Gresik, Abdul Halim of Cirebon, Ridwan Abdullah, Mas Alwi and Abdullah Ubeid of Surabaya, Sheikh Ahmad Ghana'im of Egypt and others. The formed delegation successfully sent their voice to Ibn Saud in 1928 with result that Ibn Saud deliberated the future pilgrimage and the holy cities. After its main task was done, they initially planned to dissolve the Committee, but Hasyim Asy'ari prevented so and suggested to make it become a permanent organization. Since then, the Committee transformed to a new organization called Nahdlatul Ulama.

A former whaler, he has become a preacher in the New Bedford Whaleman's Chapel. Ishmael, the narrator of the novel, hears Mapple's sermon on the subject of Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale but did not turn against God. The sermon presents themes which concerned Melville and run through the rest of the novel. Father Mapple believes, as Captain Ahab does, that truth is clear to see, and that human beings must pursue it in spite of all obstacles. Ishmael, on the other hand, finds that truth has many forms and is difficult to see or understand. Background =Models for the character= Enoch Mudge, a Methodist minister who was the chaplain of the New Bedford Seamen's Bethel, and Father E.T. Taylor, pastor of the Seamen's Bethel in New Bedford and another Methodist, served as models for Father Mapple. Before his own whaling voyage, Melville heard Mudge preach at the Seamen's Bethel. Mudge was a contributor to Sailor's Magazine, which in December 1840 printed a series of sermons on Jonah. Father Taylor was a well-known preacher whose admirers included Emerson and Whitman. Both Taylor and Mapple fused Biblical imagery and colloquial language to deliver \\"anecdotal sermons to rough sailor congregations while perched theatrically on an elevated pulpit decorated with ship gear and backed by a wall painting of a seascape.\\" The rope ladder is Melville's own amplification. =Models for the sermon= As David S. Reynolds explains, Melville was keenly aware of the popular literature and oratory of his time. Father Mapple's sermon is inspired by the more imaginative style of sermon that was becoming very popular in the United States. In addition, Reynolds argues, that Father Mapple would choose Jonah for a topic is in keeping with a 19th-century tradition of retellings of the biblical account in sermon form; Reynolds cites examples from as early as 1829. Such sermons employed nautical metaphors and colloquialisms, \\"producing a mixture of the imaginative and the sacred that directly anticipated Father Mapple's salty sermon\\". Father Mapple's sermon In chapters 7-9, Ishmael, a sailor about to sail for Nantucket where he will embark on a whaling voyage with Captain Ahab on the Pequod, goes to the Whaleman's Chapel in New Bedford. Father Mapple appears and climbs a rope ladder to his pulpit, which is the form of a ship's prow: \\"Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed beak.\\"Herman Melville, Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, Chapter 8, \\"The Pulpit\\" Father Mapple addresses the parishioners as \\"Shipmates\\" and leads them in a whaling hymn: ::The ribs and terrors in the whale ::Arched over me a dismal gloom, ::While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by, ::And lift me deepening down to doom. ::... ::In black distress, I called my God, ::When I could scarce believe him mine, ::He bowed his ear to my complaints- ::No more the whale did me confine. ::With speed he flew to my relief, ::As on a radiant dolphin borne; ::Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone ::The face of my Deliverer God. ::... Mapple then takes as his text \\"And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\\" The lesson, he says, is a \\"two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.\\" Jonah, Mapple begins, refuses God's commandment to go to the city of Nineveh and prophesy against rampant sin but instead tries to flee by taking passage on a ship. The sailors know from merely looking at him that Jonah is some sort of fugitive: But the Lord raises a great storm, and after Jonah confesses to the sailors that his disobedience is the cause, Jonah is \\"taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea.\\" Instantly an \\"oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still.\\" Yet the storm follows Jonah, and he drops \\"seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him\\". Jonah prays unto the Lord: Mapple returns to the \\"two-stranded lesson\\": The psalm An example of Melville's appropriation and development of religious material for his own thematic purposes is the hymn in Father Mapple's sermon, which draws upon Psalm 18 in the version of The Psalms and Hymns... of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in North America (compare quoteboxes). Melville's changes and revisions transform the generalized theme of the Psalm into something that bears specific correspondence to the story of Jonah. While some of the changes are purely stylistic improvements, the whole exercise demonstrates the author's \\"ability to keep within the framework of his source while substituting particularized relevant material.\\"Battenfeld (1955), 396 While adhering to the meter and rhyme scheme of the original, the second stanza (the hymn's first stanza), is almost completely rewritten to reflect Jonah's situation as stated in the King James Version of the Book of Jonah, especially 2:3: \\"For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.\\" Unpredictable is the rejection of the word \\"flood,\\" which appears in the Jonah story as well as in the Psalm.Battenfeld (1955), 395 Three stanza's from the Psalm are omitted, probably because their subject matter is not apt for the Jonah story. Thematic significance in the novel Father Mapple's sermon addresses questions that fascinated Melville and tensions that run through the rest of the novel, since Father Mapple believes, as does Ahab, that truth is clear to see, and that human beings must pursue it in spite of all obstacles; Ishmael on the other hand finds that truth has many forms and is difficult to see or understand. Reynolds notes that Father Mapple, who changes the common metaphor of God as a ship's pilot and makes himself \\"the pilot of the living God\\", confirms \\"man's capacities as a truth seeker\\". John Bryant argues that this sermon of Jonah's duty to deliver God's \\"appalling message\\" of destruction to the people of Nineveh parallels Melville's duty to \\"confront his own readers with the blasphemy yet logic of Ahab's anger and defiance\\". Nathalia Wright emphasizes Melville's general use of Biblical rhetoric and tone, and that his \\"prophetic strain\\" is most distinct in Father Mapple's sermon. Melville has Mapple use \\"the most familiar linguistic device of the Hebrew prophets\\", such as the repeated ejaculation \\"Woefullness of time\\", \\"outer darkness\\", \\"the blackness of darkness\\", and \\"the quick and the dead\\".\\"Biblical Allusion in Melville's Prose,\\" American Literature 12.2 (1940): 185–199. In adaptations *John Ince plays the part in the 1930 film, in which Father Mapple also has a daughter (played by Joan Bennett) with whom Ahab (John Barrymore) falls in love. *Father Mapple was played by Orson Welles in the 1956 film. *Gregory Peck, who played Ahab in the 1956 film, won a Golden Globe as Father Mapple in the 1998 television series. *In the 2011 television series Donald Sutherland plays Father Mapple.

The sport's name is derived from the intentionally convex or uneven nature of the bowling green which is traditionally formed with a raised centre known as the crown. Crown green bowls is played in the Midlands and northern half of England, and North Wales.  Game  The aim of crown green bowls is to roll a set of two bowls from the hand towards a smaller target bowl known as the jack. Rolling the bowl or jack is known as the delivery. When delivering a bowl or jack, the player must place one foot on a mat to ensure that all bowls and jack are sent from the same spot. A full game comprises a number of ends. An end is where the jack is rolled first. The player sending the jack can choose to deliver it wherever they like on the bowling green. This ability to bowl an end in any direction is a unique feature of crown green bowls. Players then take it in turns to roll each of their bowls towards the jack. An end finishes when all bowls have been delivered. At the amateur level it is usual for several ends to be played simultaneously on one green. If two moving woods meet, both are taken back and the shots replayed. If a moving wood strikes a stationary wood or jack from another end, it is again taken back and replayed, but the bowl struck is replaced where contact took place. The aim of an end is for a player to finish with their own bowls closer to the jack than those of the opponent. For each bowl that is closer than those of the opponent, a player scores one point. Each player usually has two bowls allowing a maximum of two points on each end. A score of one or two is denoted to the two markers (one from each team, in a team match) by raising one or two hands. The winner of the end delivers the jack in the next end. Competitive games are usually held between two people with the winner being the first person to accumulate 21 points. An unlimited number of ends are played until someone wins. Variations exist where players can have more than two bowls, games are played to 31 points or more, or players form teams of two or more players.  Bowling green  Crown green bowls is played on a specially prepared short-cut smooth grass surface known as a bowling green or simply the green (usually 45x45 yards). The green usually has a raised centre known as the crown which can often be as high as 30 centimetres above the edge of the green. The green has a ditch around the edge, and slopes on all sides from the crown towards the ditch. Greens are usually rectangular or square, but L-shaped and circular greens also exist. The surfaces also often feature ridges, hollows and slopes to make the game more difficult. Due to this vast array of historical differences, no rules stipulating the shape, size or height of the crown are laid down by the British Crown Green Bowls Association.  Bowls equipment  = Bowls = In crown green bowls, players use two bowls each. Bowls are also commonly known as woods. There are no requirement for official markings on the bowls although manufacturers branding and the weight of the bowls is common. Players often have their initials marked on one side, or use stickers to identify their bowls. One side of the bowl has an indent or dimple allowing the player to identify by touch which side of the bowl has the bias. Crown green bowls come in a variety of bias strengths, weights, densities, sizes, materials and colours. The minimum weight is but there is no maximum weight.British Crown Green Bowls Association : Laws of the Game  http://crowngreenbowls.sharepoint.com/Pages/LawsoftheGame.aspx Bowls are referred to and sold by their weight, and are available from 2 lb 0 oz to 2 lb 14 oz, in 1 oz increments. They were traditionally made from lignum vitae wood but are now manufactured from a composite plastic. Wooden bowls have a variable density throughout their core due to the nature of wood. Plastic bowls have a consistent and regular density throughout and manufacturers can produce bowls in different densities generally known as standard, low density and high density. This means that a smaller bowl with a higher density can be the same weight as a larger bowl with a lighter density. There are two ways of delivering a bowl: with or against the bias. Sending a bowl with the thumb on the biased side is known as thumb peg and sending a bowl with the thumb on the non-biased side is known as finger peg. The different pegs determine in which direction the bowl will go. A player delivering the jack is expected to declare which peg is used, but a player delivering a subsequent wood is not. = Jack = The jack, also commonly known as the block, is a smaller version of the bowls used by each player in a game of crown green bowls and also contains a bias. There are written specifications determining the size, weight and bias strength of jacks. To be able to be used in an official British Crown Green Bowls Association recognised league match or competition, jacks must be black, white or yellow. Other colours are available for use in practice. Jacks have different markings on each side. On one side there is a single circle with the manufacturer's name and other official lettering. This side of the jack is the side with the bias. The other side has a single circle surrounded by three solid dots or smaller circles indicating the non-bias side. Official jacks must also be stamped with an approved date stamp every seven years to comply with the rules. Jacks measure 9.5 cm (3 & 3/4 inches) in diameter and weigh about 660 grams (1 lb 7 oz). = Mat = The mat is also known as the footer. It is usually black and has a textured top surface to help with grip. It a simple rubber circular mat measuring 14 cm (4.5 inches) in diameter, and around 0.5 cm (1/8th of an inch) in thickness. When delivering a jack or bowl, the player must place their non-leading foot on the mat.

He rose to prominence in Illinois politics, first in the Illinois House of Representatives, then as United States Attorney, and Illinois Secretary of State. In 1853, Franklin Pierce appointed Gregg the Commissioner to the Kingdom of Hawaii to negotiate its annexation at the request of its king, Kamehameha III. In response, he cited the U.S. Constitution as not allowing annexation of a foreign state. (Texas had, in fact, been annexed a few years before with dubious legality.) His later years were spent in Carson City, Nevada. Biography David Lawrence Gregg was born in Pennsylvania on July 21, 1819. He moved west and settled in Joliet, Illinois, to practice law. He edited the Juliet Courier, the first paper in Will County, Illinois. Gregg was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1842, serving two two-year terms. Gregg then accepted an appointment by President James K. Polk as United States Attorney for the District of Illinois. He was a delegate to the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1847, representing Cook County. In 1850, he was named the Illinois Secretary of State as a Democrat, filling the unexpired term of the deceased Horace S. Cooley. Gregg was then re-elected to a two-year term. He then was a presidential elector for the 1852 election. He was a leading candidate in 1852 for the Democratic nomination as Governor of Illinois, but was defeated by Joel Aldrich Matteson. President Franklin Pierce then appointed Gregg the Commissioner to the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was involved with unsuccessful annexation discussions with the Hawaiian monarchy. In 1857, he left the office to become Hawaiian finance minister. Gregg returned to the United States, settling in Carson City, Nevada. President Andrew Johnson commissioned him receiver of public moneys for the district of lands subject to sale in the city. Gregg married Rebecca Eads on September 1, 1850.

Life Eyam village as it looked when Cunningham was curate, 1775-90 Accounts of Peter Cunningham's life have mostly been gleaned from the writings and correspondence of the Seward family, covering his period as curate at Eyam in 1775-90, and principally from four letters of his that have been preserved from that period. In addition, two accounts of him are given in 19th century works dealing with Eyam, Ebenezer Rhodes' Peak Scenery and William Wood's The History and Antiquities of Eyam. The account of him given in a past edition of the Dictionary of National Biography is vague and conjectural. Three letters were written to Thomas Seward immediately before and after his installation as curate at Eyam. He there describes himself as the son of a naval officer who would have preferred him to follow a military career and now cannot be bothered to write to him. Instead of a university education, he was privately coached before being ordained in 1772 by the Archbishop of York. He mentions having friends in Kent, and notably in Deal, from which his first letter was written. He has a close connection with a Yorkshire family from some ten years before his ordination, as well as in Scotland, from where the name Cunningham derives.House of Names A later letter to a fellow cleric mentions ‘family letters from the West Indies’. Anna Seward described him as having the manners of a gentleman and he frequently mentions warm relations with, and sometimes the patronage of, members of the peerage. Following his ordination, Cunningham was appointed as curate at the Yorkshire village of Almondbury, which he left after a while to take up a tutorship which turned out badly. His next appointment was at Eyam and he was at pains to assure his future employer that, in his opinion, the Church of England ‘approaches the nearest of all others to the pure religion of the Gospel’, deprecating the schismatic tendencies in Methodism which were then dividing Eyam parish. He also forewarns Seward that he is very deaf. Anna Seward was later to comment on his near-sightedness, which obliged him to wear spectacles, his untidy appearance and affected nasal delivery.Teresa Barnard, Anna Seward: A Constructed Life, Ashgate Publishing 2013, p.88 Nevertheless, he was soon to become a favourite with the women of the parish and was noted as being untiring in trying to educate the poor children there, as well as tutoring those of the more socially prominent. His sermons were so much admired that Thomas Seward admitted in one of his own sermons that he had left much of the preaching to Cunningham on this account.John Nichols, p.58 Very soon after his appointment, Cunningham mentions being engaged in literary pursuits and even showed the Rector and his daughter (who was the same age as himself) some of his poems. At the time he was first venturing on publication in 1783, he encountered the labouring-class poet William Newton and introduced him to Anna Seward. She too encouraged his writing and sent a poem of Newton's, addressed “To the Rev. Peter Cunningham, author of Britannia’s Naval Triumph”, to The Gentleman’s Magazine (March 1785). As well as expressing gratitude for Cunningham’s friendship, it takes up the patriotic theme of the poem and ends with the hope that he will “Still with thy pen thy country’s cause defend, Her warmest patriot and her firmest friend.”The poem also appeared in the Scots Magazine, vol. 47, p.90 The patriotism did continue and Cunningham showed particular loyalty to the royal family as defenders of the Church of England. He wrote an ode that was sung during celebrations in Chesterfield of the 1788 centenary of the 'Glorious Revolution'Quoted by Ebenezer Rhodes, p.291 and in the following year published A sermon preached at Eyam, Derbyshire, on Thursday the 23d of April, 1789, being the day appointed for a general thanksgiving for His Majesty's happy recovery. In his letter to the Reverend Thomas Wilson written in 1788,p.137-40 Cunningham referred to ‘the former variegated and adversely shaded part of my life’ before taking the curacy at Eyam, which replicates his mention of earlier misfortune and hardship in his first letter to Seward. But now, he continues, ‘I have thoroughly reconciled myself to the obscurity and sequestered nature of my situation’. After the publication of The Naval Triumph, George Rodney had offered to help find him a situation in Ireland but he had refused this, as he did initially an offer of the chaplaincy to the British factory at Smyrna so long as there was still the possibility of staying on at Eyam after Seward gave up the rectorship. Forced at last to accept the chaplaincy, he left for Smyrna in 1790 and in order to meet expenses had to sell his books and other possessions. During the years he spent in Turkey he nearly lost his life in a shipwreck, and then in a fire on land which destroyed all his papers. Reduced once more to the utmost poverty, he set out to walk back to Britain across Turkish territory, until he discovered a timely gift of money left in a book of poems with which he had been presented on leaving.Ebenezer Rhodes, pp.53-5 On his return, he took up a curacy in Chertsey, partly through the support of Charles James Fox, the dedicatee of his poem St Anne's Hill. In June 1805 he died suddenly at the annual dinner of the Chertsey Friendly Society, to which he had been in the habit of preaching a sermon every year. After his death, his debts and funeral expenses were paid with the financial support of local gentry,Obituary in the Universal Theological Magazine, September 1805, p.168 thus bringing full circle a career marked by disappointed hopes which the support of the titled among whom he moved could do little to alleviate. Poetry Cunningham published several poems anonymously, often combining topography with political themes. Their style was characterised by Ebenezer Rhodes as \\"elegant and tasteful in expression…but cold in feeling. His lines, though generally graceful, and not unfrequently polished to excellence, are occasionally cumbrous and sluggish from an excess of epithet…As a poet he had many beauties, checkered with a considerable proportion of defect.\\"Eliot, p.48 Their procession of allegorical abstractions and Latinate poeticisms was complained of as hindering his meaning. “Everything is buried in gloom and obscurity. In other words, we are presented with a great deal of pompous and high-sounding language which leaves no distinct impression on our minds.”The Monthly Review vol. 81, p.280 A good example of his writing, which changed little over 25 years, is contained in this quatrain from his description of Chatsworth House: :::But see – 'the faded forms of Sorrow' fly :::Before gay Minstrelsey’s enliv’ning Pow’rs, :::And fair Euphrosyne with sparkling Eye, :::In yon bright Palace, leads the golden Hours. The poem was published in the same year as his The naval triumph.A long excerpt appears on the Spenser and the tradition site The latter was written in commemoration of Admiral Rodney’s victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782 and published in what Cunningham described in his letter to the Reverend Thomas Wilson (1788) as ‘an incorrect and mutilated edition’.Remains, historical and literary, vol. 45, p.137-40 The poem that followed it was Chatsworth, or the Genius of England's prophecy (Chesterfield 1783).Google Books The poem describes the great mansion and surrounding landscape, linking the history of its Cavendish owners with the patriotic themes of martial honour and freedom. The topographical frontispiece from St Anne’s Hill A further political forecast was written in 1785 (but not published until two years later): The Russian prophecy, a poem occasioned by a remarkable phenomenon in the heavens, observed in Russia, February 19, 1785.Google Books The title page bears the inscription ‘Sacred to the glory and imperial virtues of Catharine the Great, Empress of all the Russias’, and the author arranged for several copies to be sent by the Russian ambassador to St Petersburg.The letter to Thomas Wilson In this poem the Genius of Russia foretells the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of a Russian dynasty on the throne of Constantinople, in anticipation of the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92) Two more topographical poems deal with locations in Surrey. Leith Hill (London 1789) followed in the tradition of John Denham's Cooper's Hill, while St Anne’s Hill (Chertsey 1800) deals with the mansion of the politician Charles James Fox, to whom the poem was dedicated on his birthday that year.Google Books Fox had withdrawn from Parliament at the time and party opponents had made his place of retirement their butt in such satires as “Imitation of Bion written at St Anne’s Hill”Poetry of The Anti-Jacobin, London 1852, pp.75-6 and “The Shade of Alexander Pope on the banks of the Thames” (1799).Included in The School for satire, London 1801, p.234 Cunningham had always made sure to reveal his anonymous authorship where it would be to his benefit, as it was in this case. The poem was also the most successful of Cunningham's works in another sense, achieving two more editions after his death.

It existed during the Early Cretaceous (Barremian-Albian) in what is now southeastern China.  Discovery and naming  In 2011, staff of the Geological Survey Research Institute at the village of Nazao, twenty kilometers southwest of the town of Datang, near Nanning in Guangxi, discovered the remains of a large theropod new to science. The dinosaur was named and described in 2014 as Datanglong guangxiensis, by Mo Jinyou, Zhou Fusheng, Li Guangning, Hunag Zhen and Cao Chenyun. The genus name combines a reference to the Datang basin with the Chinese word long, \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to the province of Guangxi. Datanglong guangxiensis is known from one specimen, holotype GMG 00001, which encompasses vertebrae and hip bones. There is a series of vertebrae that begins with the last dorsal (back) vertebra (according to the descriptors the fourteenth), continues over the five sacral vertebrae, and ends with the second tail vertebra. The sacrum is attached to a left ilium with the upper parts of the left pubic bone and the left ischium, and one piece of the right ilium. The bones were found in a layer of the Xinlong Formation, which was deposited sometime during the Early Cretaceous.  Description  Datanglong is a large predatory theropod with a length of roughly . The specimen has a preserved length of about . =Distinguishing features= The describing authors determined some distinguishing characteristics. The last dorsal vertebra has a pleurocoel, or pneumatic cavity, that is bounded by an enlarged posterior ridge between the diapophysis and the vertebral body, by the posterior ridge between the parapophysis and the vertebral body; and by the vertebral body itself. The rear dorsal vertebra has a well-developed horizontal ridge between the prezygapophysis and the parapophysis. The last dorsal vertebra has a parapophysis that protrudes more laterally than the diapophysis. The groove in the underside of the rear blade of the ilium, serving as an attachment to the musculus caudofemoralis brevis, is shallow and the \\"brevis shelf\\", the inner surface of the medial blade wall uncovered by it, is short and shaped like a ridge. The pubic peduncle of the ilium, to which the pubic bone is attached, at the rear side transversely expands to below. =Skeleton= The last dorsal vertebra resembles those of the Ceratosauria in that the parapophysis, the lower rib joint process, extends beyond the diapophysis, the upper rib joint process. The vertebra is also clearly pneumatised but the succeeding sacral vertebrae of the sacrum are not. The first tail vertebra has a depression at the level of the probable ridge between the prezygapophysis and the parapophysis. This vertebra also has a straight chevron. The spinous processes of the tail vertebrae are broken but the remaining pieces are fairly long and expand upwards. The upper profile of the ilium is unknown, due to damage. The front blade has a deeply drooping point with a rounded front edge. The vertical ridge in front of the hip joint does not form a medial shelf. The blade of the ilium is pierced by several pneumatic cavities. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is widely excavated at the rear and has a rectangular bottom surface, twice longer than wide. The ischial peduncle inserts into an upper cavity of the ischium like a pin.  Phylogeny  The describing authors placed Datanglong in the Carcharodontosauria, in a basal position, making use of a previous cladistic analysis of Matthew Carrano. Soon after the publication, the Italian paleontologist Andrea Cau pointed out that this analysis had been strongly focused on the basal Tetanurae and therefore contained few traits of the Coelurosauria. That carried the danger that basal coelurosaurians were misplaced. Cau entered the traits of Datanglong into his own, more comprehensive, analysis and this indeed revealed that Datanglong was a basal coelurosaur. If this is correct, it would be the first known basal coelurosaur of a truly large size. He also directed attention to the fact that all synapomorphies that Datanglong shared with the Carcharodontosauria (the pneumatized cavities in the ilium and the pin-and-socket connection between the ilium and the ischium) were also shared with the Megaraptora. In 2017, Adun Samathi and Phorphen Chanthasit reported in an SVP abstract that they found Datanglong to nest in Megaraptora, \\"sharing the pneumaticity of the ilium with other megaraptorans.\\" References Category:Early Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia Category:Carcharodontosauria Category:Fossil taxa described in 2014 Category:Paleontology in Guangxi ","title":"Datanglong"},{"id":"43743780","text":"Muslimist may refer to: *Muslim, an adherent of Islam *Islamist, an adherent of Islamism See also *Muslimism (disambiguation) *Muslim (disambiguation) *Islamicist (disambiguation) ","title":"Muslimist"},{"id":"43743803","text":"Johnny Greenwood (born 29 July 1939) is an Australian country music singer.

Although it was intended to replace the scherzo of the String Quintet, that piece was instead performed in its original form; the Intermezzo was not publicly premiered until after the composer's death. History Bruckner completed his String Quintet in 1879 for a group headed by Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr. However, Hellmesberger found the work's \\"curious, elfin scherzo\\" to be too challenging for the group to perform. In response, Bruckner wrote an eight-minute Intermezzo, which was completed in Vienna on 21 December 1879.C. van Zwol, pp. 683–684U. Harten, pp. 216–217 The Intermezzo (WAB 113) was in the same key (D minor) as the original scherzo and used the same trio section, but its tempo was slower and it was less technically challenging. The Intermezzo was originally intended as a less difficult alternative to the scherzo of the Quintet. Nevertheless, in 1885, Hellmesberger decided to proceed with the original Quintet after it had been premiered in full by the Winkler Quartet. The manuscript of the Intermezzo was retrieved in 1900—after Bruckner's death—from the collection of his pupil Josef Schalk.C. van Zwol, p. 236 The Intermezzo, which became an independent work scored for string quintet, was premiered on 23 January 1904 in Vienna by the Fitzner Quartet during a concert of the . There is no record of an earlier public performance. The manuscript of the Intermezzo is stored in the archive of the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. The Intermezzo was first published by Universal Edition in Vienna in 1913 (without its trio). It appeared in a complete critical edition in 1963, as appendix to the String Quintet, in Band XIII of the edited by Leopold Nowak. Music Intermezzo, Moderato in 3/4: * Theme: bars 1–42 * Development: bars 43–90 * Reprise: bars 91–142 Trio, Langsamer in E-flat major: * Theme: bars 1–8, with repeat * Development: bars 9–32 * Reprise: bars 33–40 Intermezzo da capo al fine Although, as reviewer Wayne Reisig remarks, Bruckner \\"never wrote anything which could be termed 'pops' beyond the Austrian-German border\\", the Intermezzo might be considered in that genre: it is a \\"sunny little work saturated with the feel of the Tyrol\\". The piece was inspired by folk dances, particularly the ländler. Critic James Reel for the Arizona Daily Star described it as a \\"sometimes swaggering, sometimes hesitating minuet\\" that is reminiscent of Bruckner's orchestral writing.  Selected discography  The Intermezzo is sometimes put as additional piece to recordings of the String Quintet. At the end of manuscript of the Intermezzo Bruckner wrote \\"Trio\\", by which he meant the Trio from the original Scherzo. Since the first edition of the Intermezzo was issued without the Trio, people thought that the Intermezzo had no Trio, and so some recordings are without Trio and reprise.

It is the first feature film of director Emmanuel Shirinian who wrote its screenplay. The movie tells the story of a lonely graveyard shift doorman named Abner, a once- accomplished sculptor and former college art teacher, but now sadly, a mere shadow of his former self. He is heartbroken because of an unresolved conflict with his brother over a woman he once loved, and is at the same time consumed with guilt and suicidal thoughts as he remains profoundly haunted a year after a terrible car accident that took the life of the young woman in the other vehicle. Plot It Was You Charlie (the title refers to On the Waterfront) explores the lonely life of Abner (Michael D. Cohen) a short, schluby, suicidally-depressed former teacher-artist turned graveyard shift doorman and the fierce sibling rivalry he endures (if not imagines) with Tom (Aaron Abrams), his tall, handsome, lady-killing brother. Abner also harbours a tragic secret that has debilitated his professional and personal life while Tom not only seems to have everything going for him, but also scores with Madeleine (Anna Hopkins), the babe our haplessly loveable schlemiel has long held a torch for. Zoe, a mysterious young blonde cab driver in a bright yellow beret, appears in Abner’s life, but for reasons he cannot understand. Nor does he understand the repeated appearance of strange men in trench coats who seem to follow him wherever he goes. There is also something about a painting in his local diner that mesmerizes him. Estranged from his family and even further estranged from a normal life, Abner must make sense of the things around him and come to terms with what has haunted him these years. After meeting Zoe, something magical happens to Abner as he begins a quest to seek redemption, and reconcile his conflicted past.

The Toronto Star noted its \\"uneven blend of drama and comedy\\" while The Globe and Mail noted the \\"shifts between dark and comic never quite jive\\" while Now deemed the film a \\"mopey, sluggish study\\" of its protagonist. It received a neutral rating from Victoria's Times Colonist. one reviewer From Rotten Tomatoes says the movie overly eccentric and underdeveloped Another review from Way Too Inside noted the film that knows what it wants to do but struggles to pull it off, \\"Throughout It Was You Charlie there is a sense that Shirinian has a firm grasp of the complete film in his head, but he struggles to make a clear presentation of it on-screen. Most of the humorous moments try too hard to be funny and only manage to feel forced and fall flat.\\" The New York Times noted the writer and director Emmanuel Shirinian’s has \\"taste for quirky detail\\" and the movie starts as an exercise in bleak absurdism and ends as a Frank Capra Christmas special, with little originality in between. The Arts Guild has positive review about this film, it noted the film has\\"The balanced cinematography, well-selected music, and simple direction allow us to dig into the film, truly experience every moment.\\" The Village Voice noted that director Shirinian has made a swift, moody film, with impeccable art design. Abner is a miserable creature and yet, under Shirinian’s sure hand, we end up caring very deeply about his strange, surreal plight and want nothing more than to see him climb out of his self- made quagmire.Toronto Metro Entertainment Awards * ACTRA Toronto Awards Nominee for Outstanding Performance - Male Actor (Michael D.

Somewhat unusually for a cellist, Reijseger often played pizzicato walking bass in the style of a jazz double-bassist or held and strummed the instrument like a guitar.Kaufman, 1998 They occasionally performed as the Clusone 4, with guests Guus Janssen on piano or Dave Douglas on trumpet. Clusone Trio released six albums, the first two on Moore's small independent label before recording for larger labels like Grammavision or HatArt.

The club's most successful era was in 1960s when it spent six season in the tier three Bayernliga. History ESV Nürnberg-West Fürth was formed on 17 September 1948 in the merger of three local clubs, TSV Nürnberg-West (formed 1891), Reichsbahnsportvereinigung Fürth (formed 1928) und des Reichsbahn Sportverein Nürnberg (formed 1930).Vereinsgeschichte SG Nürnberg Fürth website – ESV club history, accessed: 6 September 2014 In the 1957–58 season the club won the southern division of the 2. Amateurliga Mittelfranken but lost the Middle Franconian championship to the reserve team of SpVgg Fürth, SpVgg Fürth II. In the following promotion round ESV defeated FC Wallenfels and TSV Gochsheim and earned promotion to the northern division of the Bayernliga.Die Bayernliga 1945–1997 publisher: DSFS, accessed: 6 September 2014 ESV Nürnberg-West spent the next five seasons from 1958 to 1963 in the northern division of the Bayernliga. After a thirteenth place in its first season there the club improved every year, to the point where it finished runners-up in 1962. The following season however, when it needed to finish in the top seven to qualify for the new single division Bayernliga the club came only ninth and missed out. As a consequence ESV was grouped in the new fourth division Landesliga Bayern-Mitte instead. The club finished runners-up in the league in its first season but this was followed by two mid-table finishes in 1965 and 1966. In the 1966–67 season ESV managed to win the league and earn promotion to the Bayernliga for the second time. Back in the Bayernliga for a single season in 1967–68 the club managed only fourteen points in thirty four games and was promptly relegated again. The fortunes of ESV declined after that, with a sixth place in 1970 as its best result in the following six Landesliga seasons. In 1974 a fifteenth place in the league meant another relegation, with the club never returning to this level again.Landesliga Bayern-Mitte tables and results Manfreds Fussball Archiv, accessed: 6 September 2014 ESV disappeared into lower amateur league football after this. By the mid-1990s the club experienced more and more financial difficulties. The club, as a railways sports club, depended on the German railway, the Deutsche Bundesbahn to provide it with sports grounds. The German railway in turn demanded that, for preferential financial treatment it required the club to have a set percentage of railway employees in its ranks, something ESV found difficult to achieve. At the same time another local club, FSV Gostenhof 1883, who themselves had played three seasons in the Bayernliga from 1948 to 1952, was financially healthy but lacked a sufficiently sized home ground. In 1998 the two clubs decided on a merger and, in August 1998 a new club was formed, the SG Nürnberg Fürth 1883, ending ESV's existence a month short of its fiftieth anniversary.Vereinsgeschichte SG Nürnberg Fürth website – Club history, accessed: 6 September 2014 Stadium The club played its home games at the Sportgelände in der Regelsbacher Straße, holding 10,000 spectators.

It works as an advisory body, trains trainers, and builds public health educational materials based on empirical research. It has a network of volunteers and activists and collaborates with other organizations in the U.S. and Europe. Some of its work is grassroots activist work. About In the late 1990s and early 2000s, concurrent with the rapid growth of the Internet and the increased accessibility to pornography that it provided, feminists in the U.S. began to organize to discuss the proliferation of pornography and of \\"violence associated with its production and consumption\\". Some of the discussion participants decided to rebuild a national movement, similar to one of the previous 20 years, to address the harms of the pornography industry. Several feminists developed a contemporary version of the slide shows developed in the 1970s to be used as an educational tool and to inspire action against the pornification (or sexualization) of culture. Stop Porn Culture was created from these efforts. The Stop Porn Culture mission statement reads: :Stop Porn Culture is dedicated to challenging the pornography industry and an increasingly pornographic pop culture. Our work toward ending industries of sexual exploitation is grounded in a feminist analysis of sexist, racist, and economic oppression. We affirm sexuality that is rooted in equality and free of exploitation, coercion, and violence.  Activism  Gail Dines, founding member of Stop Porn Culture, wrote Pornland. In 2014 a documentary, with the same name, was released and promoted on the Stop Porn Culture website, and is described as \\"an ideal introduction to the core arguments of the feminist anti-pornography movement.\\" Stop Porn Culture works to create awareness on what it calls the current \\"porn culture.\\" Much of this work is done online through online lecture videos and social media work as well as through workshops and conferences for Feminist Slideshow Training. It is an unpaid organization and recruits through a volunteer and internship program focused on marketing, digital writing, video editing, and social media projects. In 2013 Stop Porn Culture started a petition against the journal, Porn Studies, a first-of-its-kind, peer-reviewed publication focused on porn studies. Stop Porn Culture's co founder Gail Dines claimed that the journal has a pro-porn bias, a claim that the journal denied.

The two teams first played in 1905 and have met nearly every year since 1919 (missing only 1921, 1924, and the World War II years 1943–1945), frequently vying for the conference championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl. Stanford is USC's oldest current rival. Series history =Early rivalry= The rivalry began in earnest in the 1930s after USC had won three national championships in five years. A group of Stanford freshmen, after a stinging 1932 loss to an undefeated USC team, promised never to lose to USC again. The \\"Vow Boys\\" made good on their promise, winning their next three games against the Trojans, beginning with the 1933 win that broke USC's 27-game undefeated streak. =Notable games and incidents= For most of its history, USC dominated the series, and overall USC has won about two-thirds of the games, but the rivalry has been marked with notable incidents and expressions of disdain between the two schools. In 1972, USC coach John McKay accused Stanford and its fans of having \\"no class\\" and said he'd \\"like to beat Stanford by 2,000 points\\"; Stanford coach Jack Christiansen responded that he wouldn't \\"get into a urinating contest with a skunk\\".Greg Katz, \\"Coaches long a part of USC- Stanford rivalry\\", ESPN.com, September 4, 2014.Scott Wolf, \\"USC-Stanford football game always seems to include some ill will\\", Los Angeles Daily News, September 3, 2014. Two years earlier, when McKay's son J.K. and his high school teammate Pat Haden had told him they were considering going to Stanford, he replied, \\"If it was between Stanford and Red China, I would pay your way to Peking.\\" Both played at USC under McKay, as the Trojans won national titles in 1972 and 1974. In 1979, Stanford came back in the last four minutes to tie #1 USC 21–21 on October 13. This game, considered one of the greatest of the 20th century,Whittingham, Richard (2001). \\"6\\", Rites of autumn: the story of college football (in English). New York: The Free Press, 148-183. . effectively cost USC a national title (they dropped to #4 in the polls afterwards). USC finished 11–0–1, but was ranked #2 in both polls due to the tie. In 1980, the Stanford Band marched onto the field accompanied by a horse skeleton on wheels, being ridden by a Trojan-helmeted human skeleton, in a parody of USC's Traveler mascot.David Wharton, \\"Riding a High Horse : Saukko, Better Known as Tommy Trojan, Saddles Up Traveler for 25th Season at USC\\", Los Angeles Times, September 19, 1985. For the 2012 game, the Stanford band leader inexplicably showed up dressed as the USC Trojan mascot. =Recent history= USC cemented its margin in the series between 1958 and 1990, going 29–3–1, but the teams have split the 30 decisions since. The competitive atmosphere of the rivalry increased in the early 1990s when Bill Walsh returned for his second tenure as Stanford's head coach, and particularly heated up in 2007 after Stanford hired head coach Jim Harbaugh. 1–3, unranked Stanford (who had been 1–11 the prior season under head coach Walt Harris) entered the 2007 game as a 41-point underdog against #2 USC, but pulled out a 24–23 win in what has been called one of the biggest college football upsets of all time. The 2009 game was marked by a post-game verbal confrontation between Harbaugh and USC head coach Pete Carroll, after #25 Stanford capped off its convincing 55–21 win over #11 USC with a late 2-point conversion attempt and another touchdown; Carroll came off the field saying \\"What's your deal?\\" at Harbaugh, who responded, \\"What's your deal?\\" Stanford then adopted the phrase as a slogan for its season ticket packages. In recent years, the rivalry has been memorable for its upsets. The lower-ranked team pulled off an upset six out of nine years from 2007–2015 (four by Stanford and two by USC), including four years in a row from 2012–2015 (two each for Stanford and USC). In 2012, #21 Stanford knocked off the #2 Trojans, 21–14. In 2013, unranked USC defeated #5 Stanford 20–17, ending Stanford's longest winning streak in the series at four, and possibly costing the Cardinal a trip to the national championship game.Tim Kawakami, \\"Stanford-USC football rivalry more friendly\\", The San Jose Mercury News, September 12, 2012.George Schroeder, \\"Southern Cal, Stanford a real rivalry\\", USAToday, September 14, 2012.Jack Blanchat, \\"The Absurdity of Rivalry: A history of Stanford and USC's insane 7-year battle\\", Yahoo! Sports, September 4, 2014. In 2015, unranked Stanford went on the road and upset #6 USC 41–31. In 2010, the then-Pac-10 Conference expanded to 12 teams and split into north and south divisions, moving Stanford and USC into different divisions. This move threatened the annual rivalry, since teams from each division were not scheduled to play each other every year; however, the conference elected to maintain the \\"historic California rivalries\\", including both the Stanford–USC rivalry and the Cal-UCLA rivalry. Both teams being ranked entering the game was once a rare occurrence but has become the norm in recent years. There have been 15 games where both Stanford and USC were ranked, with 2 from 1940–1953, 4 from 1968–1972, just 1 from 1973–2008, and 8 since 2009. USC leads the series 61–33–3; they have led since the third game. USC holds the longest win streak in the series, with 12 wins from 1958–1969. USC also went 14–0–1 from 1976–1990, with the two teams playing to a tie in 1979. Stanford's longest win streak was 4 from 2009–2012. The early years of the series had near-parity, with USC leading 17–15–2 from 1905–1957. USC then went 39–9–1 from 1958–2006; however, Stanford is 9–5 since then, including 4 of 6 in the L.A. Coliseum. The teams met twice in 2015 - once in the regular season and, after #7 Stanford and #24 USC won their divisions, a rematch in the Pac-12 Championship Game, which #7 Stanford won 41–22, also ending the four-year streak of upsets in the series. In 2017 the teams, both ranked in the top 15, again met for the conference championship, with USC winning 31-28, the first win by a southern division team since the Pac-12 adopted the championship game format.Josh Dubow, \\"No. 11 USC beats No. 14 Stanford 31-28 for Pac-12 title\\", Associated Press in San Francisco Chronicle, December 2, 2017.

Life  His father was the district veterinarian. In 1871, his family moved to Grünberg and he attended the Gymnasium in Laubach. In 1888, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, where he studied under Ferdinand Keller. With a scholarship from the Grand Ducal Ministry of the Interior, he undertook further studies in Munich, Vienna and Italy. In 1900, he exhibited at the Glaspalast. Although he was officially enrolled at Karlsruhe until 1905, he actually pursued his studies with Robert von Haug in Stuttgart. He briefly lived in Darmstadt, then returned to Grünberg in 1905 although, as a free-lance painter, he travelled frequently to visit his clients. After 1915 he lived in Wimpfen. World War I hit him very hard; especially the loss of friends such as August Macke and Franz Marc. In response, he abandoned impressionism for a gloomier Academic style and his output decreased dramatically. The Carl-Geist-Straße in Grünberg is named after him.

In 1999, he resigned from office over allegations of certificate forgery. He was later convicted of certificate forgery and sentenced to two years in prison with an option of a fine. He paid the fine and was later pardoned by President Olusegun Obasanjo. Political career Buhari had been a businessman before entering politics. In 1999, Buhari was appointed the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the fourth-highest office in Nigeria. However, this only lasted for six weeks before the University of Toronto scandal broke, ultimately leading to his resignation and prosecution. In 2013, he was chosen as part of the governing council of the University of Nigeria by the Nigerian government. Controversies The news of Buhari's age and certificate forgery first broke out on 16 February 1999 by an investigative news publication, TheNews magazine. Their investigation concluded that Buhari was born in 1970, not 1963 as he claimed, and also that he never graduated from the University of Toronto. The article claimed that Buhari not only never graduated, but never even attended the university. Claims about Buhari's age were especially relevant to his position as Speaker of the House, since section 65(1) of the Constitution of Nigeria disqualified anyone below the age of 30 from running for election to the House. Buhari had also claimed that he completed his National Youth Service at Standard Construction in Kano. This also proved untrue, as no record could be found of his completing the program. When Buhari was confronted with multiple allegations of fraud, he denied them as attacks on him and threatened to file a libel lawsuit against the publisher. He asserted that the allegations were a witch-hunt. The magazine, however, wrote to the University of Toronto, requesting confirmation that Buhari was an alumnus, who denied having any record of his attendance. On 23 July 1999, disgraced and cornered, Buhari admitted to falsifying his age and forging certificates as well as other allegations from the TheNews report, saying in a statement: He then resigned from House of Representatives.

Boston Elevated Railway streetcar built by Laconia Car Company in 1911 Laconia Car Company streetcar built in 1918 preserved at the Seashore Trolley Museum History The Ranlet Manufacturing Company began building horse-drawn wagons, carriages and stagecoaches in 1844. The company was identified as Ranlet Car Company to emphasize focus on manufacturing railway cars after railways reached Laconia in 1848. By 1869 the company employed one hundred men and was producing three hundred freight cars per year. In 1870 the company began producing railway passenger cars at the rate of about one per month. The company was reorganized as the Laconia Car Company in 1882, occupying seven acres of downtown Laconia including a four-story brick foundry for casting and forging metal parts. Some parts were used for wooden cars assembled in nearby shops, while other parts were sold to railways and other car manufacturers building or repairing wooden cars. Laconia was producing 125 railway passenger cars per year by 1893 primarily for New England railways, horse streetcar lines, and interurban electric lines. The foundry produced wheels, axles and trucks including a distinctive electric traction truck. In 1889 Laconia finished a prototype steel railway car started in 1884 by a Boston shipbuilding firm under contract to the Steel Car Company. Wood remained Laconia's preferred building material, but steel underframes were used beginning in 1908. Laconia employed nearly five hundred men completing electric railway cars at the rate of one a day; and their products could be found operating as far away as the Los Angeles Railway. Employment increased to a thousand workers by 1912; but focus on electric railway cars made the company uncompetitive for conventional railway vehicles as electric railway riders began using automobiles, and 1914 was the last year of profitable operation for the company. Production shifted to conventional baggage, mail and express cars; and a final order for ten cars was completed for the Boston Elevated Railway in 1923. Production shifted to plywood motorboats before the company closed in 1928.

This ZEC is administered by \\"Association chasse et pêche Collin Inc\\". The area economy is based on forestry and recreational and tourism activities.  Geography  Collin ZEC occupies an area of inside the unorganized Lac-Matawin territory. Its territory is entirely in the forest. Collin ZEC is bordered to the west by the Rouge-Matawin Wildlife Reserve, which is located north of the Mont-Tremblant National Park. The zec Boullé is located northwest of Zec Collin. On the south side, the ZEC Collin was separated from the Zec Lavigne by a narrow corridor which runs east to Matawin West River. The southern boundary of the ZEC Collin is located close to the Matawin West River and about six miles northwest of Saint-Michel-des-Saints, in the administrative region of Lanaudière. The territory of the ZEC has two areas joined together by a narrow band. The entrance station of the ZEC is located in the northern part of its territory, near the mouth of the Matawin River which crosses the territory towards the southeast.  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Collin Zec\\" has originated from the lake Collin. The lake lies in the southern part of the zone d'exploitation contrôlée (controlled harvesting zone) (Zec). From a local surname, the name of this body of water is mentioned in 1888 on a map of the Township Brassard.Source: Names and places of Quebec, the work of the Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names of Quebec), published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed, and in that of a CD produced by Micro-Intel in 1997 from this dictionary. The name \\"ZEC Collin\\" was recorded on December 5, 1982 at the Bank of place names in the Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec).  Hunting and Fishing  Located in one of the good wildlife areas of Quebec, the ZEC Collin is populated by moose, black bear and small hunted animal. Many rivers of the ZEC are full of pike, lake trouts, walleye, bass and brook fountain. In 2014 and 2015, the Collin ZEC will set up spawning grounds for brook trout in lakes Berceuse, Caché, Clair, Conscrit, Cornemuse, Desève, Froid, \\"de la Hauteur\\" and \\"du Milieu\\" (the Middle). This project was made possible through a grant from Fisheries and Oceans Canada. This development aims to increase the number of spawning grounds for brook trout in these lakes in order to increase the survival rate of eggs of brook trout and reduce costs associated with planting. Thanks to a grant from the Fondation de la faune du Québec (Wildlife Foundation of Quebec), the lakes Alfred, Liliane, Riter, Roche, Vasar, Vert and Yvette will also be studied to assess the need for spawning for the brook fountain and the necessary work in spawning beds for increasing natural yields.  Huardière  Since 1973, the Department of Biological Sciences of the UQAM offers field courses to undergraduate students in biology and ecology of the certificate. Since the summer of 1983, the courses are the ecological station Huardière at Saint-Michel-des-Saints.

The Philippine Army was initially organized under the National Defense Act of 1935 (Commonwealth Act No. 1) that formally created the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Certain components of the Armed Forces of the Philippines were under the control of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) from 1941 to 1946, after the entry of the U.S. into World War II.  Origin  Before the establishment of the Commonwealth Government in 1935, no effort was made for self-defense by Philippine forces since the United States assumed responsibility for the defense of the islands. An immediate concern of the commonwealth government was the defense of an emerging nation. President-elect Manuel L. Quezon convinced his friend, General Douglas MacArthur (Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army), to organize a national army with Franklin D. Roosevelt's agreement in the summer of 1935. MacArthur had unusually-broad authority to deal with the Secretary of War and the Chief of Staff as military adviser to the commonwealth government to organize a Philippine national army. MacArthur had broad authority to deal with the United States Secretary of War, his successor as the Army Chief of Staff, and the United States Army Philippine Department and its commander Major General Lucius R. Holbrook (who had been told that his most important peacetime mission was to assist MacArthur in forming a Philippine force capable of defending the islands). MacArthur selected Majors Dwight D. Eisenhower and James B. Ord as his assistants; they and a committee at the Army War College prepared plans for the defense of the Philippine Commonwealth, with a target of independence in 1946. The plan called for a small regular army with divisions of about 7,500 men, conscription of all men between twenty-one and fifty years of age and a ten-year training program to build a reserve army, a small air force and a fleet of torpedo boats capable of repelling an enemy. The Philippine National Assembly's first act was the passage of the National Defense Act on December 21, 1935, with initial plans for a 10,000-man regular force based on the incorporation of the Philippine Constabulary and a 400,000-man reserve force by 1946 and a West-Point-type military academy in Baguio on Luzon. Quezon noted that there was inadequate funds and time to build an effective naval defense force; the act provided for no navy, but an Offshore Patrol within the army. The offshore patrol would be based on British-designed fast torpedo boats, with an anticipated thirty-six boats under contract by 1946. The Philippine Army Air Corps would, by that time, have about 100 bombers and additional tactical aircraft in support of the offshore patrol in coastal defense. The Commonwealth would have ten military districts (comparable to corps areas in the United States), each able to provide an initial reserve division (growing to three) with full development of the reserve force. In a 1936 speech MacArthur described the force's function as making an invasion so costly that no nation would make the attempt, emphasizing the islands' terrain as making penetration nearly impossible. Development was slow; 1936 was largely devoted to building camps and facilities, with the first conscripts called up on January 1, 1937. A major problem was the formation of a military-officer corps, with constabulary officers trained in law enforcement and limited numbers of Philippine Scouts officers becoming senior officers in the new force. By the end of 1939, the reserve force numbered 104,000 men and 4,800 officers. The Philippine Army Air Corps had about forty planes and a hundred trained pilots by 1940. The offshore patrol's development was more problematic, with only two British boats delivered before the war in Europe cut off further deliveries and a struggle to build boats under license locally produced only one boat by October 1941. President Quezon and others recognized that the naval defense was inadequate protection against a first-rate naval power, but the Philippines had neither the money nor industrial base to provide adequate naval force and relied on the assumption that the United States Navy would not idly stand by if the Philippines were attacked. When the war with Japan began, the Philippine Army was six years from its founding in December 1935 and about five years from the 1946 date at which it was to be fully operational. The naval force which was to protect it against a first-rate naval power was in ruins at Pearl Harbor; the Japanese had pilots standing by fueled-and-loaded bombers in Formosa, prepared to strike the Philippines.  History  = Initial establishment and training = The Army of the Philippines was initially organized under the National Defense Act of 1935 (Commonwealth Act No. 1), of December 21, 1935. The Act specified that presidential appointments to grades above third lieutenant should be made from former holders of reserve commissions in the United States Army and former Philippine Scouts and Constabulary officers. After the establishment of the commonwealth, Manuel L. Quezon, its first president, sought the services of General Douglas MacArthur to evolve a national-defense plan. On December 21, 1935, the Army of the Philippines was established. The act set forth the organizational structure of the army and enlistment and mobilization procedures. Davao The army's development was slow. In 1936 a general headquarters and camps were built, cadres were organized and instructors, drawn largely from the Philippine Constabulary, were trained. The commander of the Philippine Department provided Philippine Scouts as instructors and detailed U.S. Army officers to assist in the inspection, instruction and administration of the program. By the end of the year, instructors were trained and camps (including general headquarters) established. The first group of 20,000 to 40,000 men was called up on January 1, 1937, and by the end of 1939 there were 4,800 officers and 104,000 men in the reserves. Infantry training was provided at camps throughout the Philippines; field-artillery training was concentrated near the U.S. Army's Fort Stotsenburg (near Angeles in the province of Pampanga, about fifty miles north of Manila) and specialized training was provided at Fort William McKinley, south of Manila. Coast artillery instruction was carried out at Fort Stotsenburg and Grande Island, in Subic Bay, by personnel supplied largely by the American commander at Corregidor. = Mobilization as part of U.S. Army Forces Far East = With the threat of war with the Empire of Japan imminent, on July 26, 1941 a new U.S. command in the Far East, the United States Army Forces Far East (USAFFE), was created under Douglas MacArthur (who also became a Philippine Field Marshal). That day, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a presidential order (6 Fed. Reg. 3825) calling \\"all the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines\\" into the service of the U.S. armed forces. Despite the order's wording, it did not order all the military forces of the Philippine Commonwealth government into the service of the United States; only those units and personnel indicated in orders issued by a general officer of the United States Army were mobilized and made an integral part of the USAFFE, and only those members of a unit who physically reported for duty were inducted. With an annual appropriation of almost ₱16 million, the mobilized units trained new Filipino members in defense. The Philippine Army was drawn from local Christian and Muslim Filipinos, including native Filipinos, Filipino-Mestizos, Spanish-Filipinos, Chinese-Filipinos and Moro-Filipinos. By the time of the Japanese invasion the 10 reserve divisions were about two-thirds mobilized, for a force of 100,000 \\"poorly equipped and trained\\" troops. The Philippine Scouts numbered about 12,000.Chapter III: The Reinforcement of the Philippines The Fall of the Philippines US Army in WWII: The War in the Pacific p50 The army was primarily infantry, with some combat engineers and artillery.Chapter IV: Prewar Plans, Japanese and American p58 At that time there were two regular and ten reserve divisions in the Army of the Philippines, spread across officers in general headquarters, camps in Manila and across the country. This included the North Luzon Force under Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright); the South Luzon Force, activated on December 13, 1941 under Brig. Gen. George M. Parker; the Visayan-Mindanao Force under Maj. Gen. William F. Sharp in the southern islands (61st, 81st, and 101st Infantry Divisions and three other infantry regiments), and the reserve force. The North Luzon Force included the 11th, 21st, and 31st reserve infantry divisions. The South Luzon Force included the 1st (regular) Division and the reserve 41st, 51st and 71st Divisions. After the war ended, the Army was reorganized into the Philippine Armed Forces.

Early life and education Tice is from Houston, Texas, the eldest of seven siblings. He is an Eagle Scout and grew up dreaming of becoming an international correspondent for NPR. At the age of 16, Tice attended the University of Houston for one year, then transferred to and graduated from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 2002. He completed two years of study at Georgetown University Law Center before going to Syria as a freelance journalist during the summer break before his third and final year of law studies. Career Tice was previously a U.S. Marine Corps infantry officer, serving tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tice's father said, “He was hearing reports from Syria saying this is happening and that is happening but it can't be confirmed because there really are no reporters on the ground. And he said, ‘You know, this is a story that the world needs to know about.’” He was one of only a few foreign journalists to report from inside Syria during intensification of the civil war. He entered the country in May 2012 and traveled through central Syria, filing battlefield dispatches before arriving in Damascus in late July 2012. Tice's reporting garnered his Twitter account 2,000 followers. He stopped tweeting after August 11, 2012. Tice was one of the first American correspondents to witness Syrian-rebel confrontations. His coverage was cited (along with efforts of additional reporters) as contributing to McClatchy winning a George Polk Award for war reporting for its coverage of Syria's civil war.  Abduction  Austin Tice while in captivity, taken August 2012 Tice was working as a freelance journalist for McClatchy, The Washington Post, CBS and other media when he was abducted from Darayya, Syria. There was no immediate contact from Tice or his captors, but in September 2012 a 47-second video of Tice blindfolded and bound was released. In October 2012, a U.S. spokesperson said it believed, based on the limited information it had, that Tice was in the custody of the Syrian government. No government or group in Syria has said it is holding Tice. In February 2015, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) launched its pro bono #freeaustintice campaign. Since September 2012, RSF has been assisting and advising his family. His parents asked RSF to help them raise awareness about their son's situation. RSF partnered with the global advertising agency J. Walter Thompson to prepare a public awareness campaign in order to do everything possible to bring Austin Tice safely home. The campaign has since garnered over 17,000 signatories and a widespread blindfold pledge on social media.Reporters Without Borders Launches #freeaustintice Campaign, a First In US Media History In April 2018, the FBI increased their reward for information regarding Tice's whereabouts to $1,000,000, and two US officials said Tice is believed to have survived captivity. In August 2018, a US State Department official said the US government still believe Tice is being held by the Syrian government or its allies. Concerning an August meeting between US and Syrian security officials in Damascus, two senior US intelligence sources told Reuters the \\"ongoing dialogue\\" with the Syrian government included the fate of Tice. In November 2018, Reuters reported that Robert O’Brien, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, had called on Russia to \\"exert whatever influence they have in Syria\\" to secure Tice's release. The Syrian government said that it was unaware of Tice's whereabouts. In December 2018, Tice's parents announced during a press conference that they had received new information that indicated their son was still alive without elaborating further. Speaking to reporters from Beirut, Tice's parents claimed that the best chance of Tice's release would come from direct talks between the US and Syrian governments.

Considered an attractive vessel with a clipper bow and twin raked smokestacks, Bayocean was expensive to operate, was \\"somewhat cranky\\" at sea, and spent much of the time tied to a dock. In 1913, Bayocean then transferred to San Francisco Bay where it served briefly as an excursion vessel. In 1918, Bayocean was purchased by the U.S. Navy and converted to a patrol vessel. Following a brief active career, Bayocean was laid up again for about two years, as the Navy demobilized and sought to find buyers for its surplus ships. In 1921, the Navy sold Bayocean at auction to the San Francisco concern of Crowley Launch and Tug, now Crowley Maritime. Design and construction =Design= On February 25, 1911, final papers authorizing the construction of Bayocean were signed by Joseph Supple and T.B. Potter. Supple and the yacht's designer, Fred Ballin decided the same day on orders for special parts to be manufactured in the east. The T.B. Potter Realty Company, with an office at 720 Corbett Street in Portland, Oregon, would be the owners of the yacht. On February 25, some construction details relating to the planking of the bow and stern still remained to be worked out, but the hull lines of the vessel were ready to be laid out. The yacht was to be built at Supple's shipyard on the Willamette River at the foot of east Belmont Street, in Portland, Oregon. It was necessary to tear out the wall of one of the sheds at the Supple yard to make room for the yacht's construction. Supple planned to launch the boat, once engines had been installed, stern first, with the launching to occur if possible before May 15, before the water in the Willamette river could rise as it usually did in a freshet in June. =Construction= Work began on Friday, March 10, 1911. The keel was scheduled to be laid the next day. The anticipated completion date had been rolled back to June 1, 1911. By May 2, 1911, the machinery had been installed on the yacht, and Supple had put a large force of workmen on the job to complete the vessel by the contract deadline of June 1, 1911. =Launch= Launch of Bayocean. On May 12, 1911, it was announced that the launching of Bayocean was to take place the next day, Saturday, May 12. The yacht was to be completely white in color. On May 12, the hull was then being painted, and the upper works had already received the first coat. it was anticipated that the vessel would be complete by June 1, the contracted delivery date to the owners, or a few days later. The May 13 launch was rescheduled to May 27, 1911, at 1:30 pm. The programme for the event promised speeches by Portland Mayor Simon and harbormaster Speier. Launch did come, on the afternoon of May 27, 1911, when, at a few minutes after 3:00 pm, Bayocean was launched into the water \\"with the ease and grace of a duck.\\" A bottle of champagne had been tied to blue and white silk streamers, and when five-year-old Elizabeth Potter let go off the streamers, the bottle crashed directly on to the bow of Bayocean, breaking into dozens of pieces. Joseph Supple gave the command \\"Cut the line\\", and the yacht slid into the river. The launch programme had been directed by the Portland Ad Men's club, with Tom Richardson as master of ceremonies. There were a large number of spectators, which according to a report of the event, formed the \\"largest crowd to view a launching in the history of local maritime affairs.\\" The crowd took over every place in the vicinity from which the launch could be seen, including the Supple yard, the roofs of neighboring buildings, and the east approach of the Morrison Bridge. Besides Tom Richardson, other speakers at the event included Harbormaster Speier, Portland mayor Simon, Judge Van Zant, representing Governor of Oregon Oswald West (1873-1960, David N. Mosessohn (b.1883), president of the Portland Ad Men's club, and T. Irving Potter, vice- president of the yacht's owners, the T.B. Potter Realty Company, =Specifications= Upon completion, Bayocean was long, with a beam of and depth of hold of . The overall size of the vessel was 148 gross and 87 net tons. The official registry number was 208705. As an ocean-going vessel, Bayocean was given a unique set of flag recognition signal letters, in Bayocean's case, these were L.B.W.D. There were stateroom accommodations below decks for 44 passengers and 14 members of the crew. The cabin above the deck housed the traveller's lounge (called a \\"saloon\\"), the galley, bath, and owner's quarters. The T.B. Potter Realty Company advertised that Bayocean cost $50,000 to construct. Other reports differ, with one saying the yacht had cost \\"over $40,000\\", and another giving the cost as simply $40,000. Bayocean was intended to carry about 100 passengers, with accommodations for 40 persons in staterooms. Reports on crew size differed, with one report prior to launch stating there would be ten men in the crew. and another in 1913 giving the figure of seven. The crew were attired on uniforms. =Power plant= The yacht would be driven by three gasoline engines turning three propellers. These engines together generated either 475 or 500 horsepower. Designer Ballin believed the yacht could be run economically at low speed by running only a single engine. As of 1921, Bayocean was reported to have been powered by three 6-cylinder, 4-cycle Speedway engines, apparently the ones originally installed, generating 500 indicated horsepower. The center engine was slightly more powerful with cylinder dimensions of 9 inch diameter with 11.5 inch stroke, generating 175 horsepower, with the ones on the side having cylinder dimensions of 7.5 inch diameter with 9 inch stroke producing 150 horsepower each. The engines, air-starting and reversing, were all six-cylinder types, built by the Gas Engine and Power Company, under the Speedway patent, and furnished by the Rober Machinery Company, were guaranteed to drive the yacht at a speed of per hour. Bayocean had an auxiliary engine to generate electric power for the lighting system, working the pumps for the bilge and fire protection, and supplying air pressure. =Preparation for service= Bayocean was not ready for service upon launch. Among other things, the engines were not yet connected to the propeller shafts. Additinonally, Bayocean could not legally transport paying passengers until a certificate was issued by the United States Steamboat Inspection Service. Local inspectors Fuller and Edwards refused to grant an approval certificate to Bayocean until certain changes, characterized as \\"minor\\" in a news report, had been made. These changes included installing ventilators to the engine room, providing an access route (called a \\"companionway\\") forward of the pilot house, and other modifications. Publicity type of events were undertaken prior to entry into formal service. On May 31, 1911, Bayocean's owners offered a free trip to Tillamook Bay and back, any time during that summer, for the person who could present to the company the best photograph of the launching of the yacht, provided they also made available the negative on demand for the company's publicity use. The yacht was involved in the 1911 Portland Rose Festival. On Monday, June 5, 1911, leading a flotilla of motor boats from the Astoria Motorboat Club in a river parade, Bayocean acted as the \\"King's Barge\\" for \\"Rex Oregonus\\", the titular head of the Rose Festival. In the week of June 1, 1911, Bayocean was used as the flagship for the Oregon state championship swimming races, to be held Friday, June 9, at a course in the Willamette Riverof the dock of the Portland Railway, Light, and Power Company, upriver from the Hawthorne Bridge. The races, which were sponsored by the Multnomah Amateur Athletic Club, were scheduled to start at 2:00 pm, with Bayocean picking up the board of directors of the club, and their wives and friends at 1:00 pm at the Joseph Supple dock, and then proceeding to a position along the race course. Operations in Oregon Advertisement for Bayocean excursion cruise, placed in Morning Oregonian, on June 30, 1911. =Summer of 1911= The plan for operation of the yacht was to leave Portland at night, so that the Columbia River bar could be crossed during the daylight of early morning. The return to Portland would be made during the daylight, with a stop at Astoria, so that passengers who wished could disembark and take the train back to Portland. It was intended to make the run from Portland to Tillamook three times per week. At the yacht's anticipated speed of 18 miles per hour, was about a four-hour sea voyage from the mouth of the Columbia river to the wharf at Bay Ocean. Bayocean made its first ocean trip in June 1911. The yacht left Portland at dawn on Sunday June 18, 1911, and reached the Bayocean resort in just over 12 hours. Speeds of 16 and 17 knots were reached when the vessel was under full power. On board were T. Irving Potter, of Potter Realty Company, Fred A. Ballin, Joseph Supple, and a number other guests. On Friday, June 30, 1911, when Bayocean was returning from Tillamook, hot bearing in the main engine, attributed to improper work by an oiler, forced it to stop overnight at Rainier, Oregon, only reaching Portland the next morning. =Summer of 1912= Bayocean in service, possibly on the Oregon coast. After the summer of 1911, Bayocean was out of service and moored in Tillamook Bay until late May 1912, when the yacht was taken to Portland for an overhaul at the Supple yard where the boat had been launched the year before. By June 1912, Bayocean was returned to service, being scheduled to make an excursion to Garibaldi and the Bayocean resort on June 25, 1912. The promoters had originally charged $20 and had touted the trip as an industrial and businessman's excursion, but then lowered the price to $12.50 and recharacterize the trip as a jaunt. In March 1912, the company, through a newly hired resort manager, was announcing that Bayocean would be available for visitors for \\"deep sea fishing trips and moonlight excursions\\" during the summer season. There would soon no longer be any need to use the yacht to transport resort guests from Portland, because a rail line, called the \\"Lytle Road\\" had been completed by the Southern Pacific from Portland, across the coast mountain range, and into Tillamook, a distance of 85 miles. The T.B. Potter Realty Company and the railroad would cooperate to advertise the resort and rail travel to it during the forthcoming summer. By early June 1912, rail service to Garibaldi had been established, with a special excursion train planned to depart Portland at 9:00 am on June 27, and arriving in Garibaldi at 2:30 pm the same day, considerably faster than transport by water. Excursionists arriving by rail would be taken over to Bayocean resort in launches. In 1912, Bayocean did not run on the Portland- Tillamook Bay route as it had done during 1911, prior to the establishment of the rail link to Garibaldi. The yacht was made available for deep sea fishing side-trips by the excursionists arriving by train. Bayocean was present in Portland on June 11, 1912 to lead the Rose Festival Parade of Ships. As with the 1911 Rose Festival, T.B. Potter lent Bayocean to accommodate the women officers of the Multnomah Club who were involved in the Oregon State Swimming Championship. By late July 1912, large crowds of people were taking the train to Garibaldi to reach the Bayocean resort. To accommodate the crowd, the resort organized a ferry service to carry people from Garibaldi across the bay to Bayocean. According to one non-contemporaneous report, Bayocean was used as a ferry between Garibaldi and the resort. However, a more timely account states that the yacht was too big to maneuver well in the shallow waters of the bay. Instead the task of ferrying was assigned to the much smaller yacht Henrietta (28 feet long, passenger capacity: 30), brought in from the city of Tillamook and operating under Captain Emmett Jenkins. Transfer to California =Reasons for sale= Bayocean at the Bayocean wharf on Tillamook Bay, June 1911. Bayocean spent most of its time in Oregon tied up to this dock. According to one report, Bayocean was said by mariners to be \\"an excellent sea boat.\\" Another source states that the yacht was \\"somewhat cranky for coastwise service.\\" The yacht was expensive to operate. By 1913, Bayocean had been used to carry passengers from Portland to the Bayocean resort for just one season, that of 1911, and the cost was too great to continue. One element of cost was the annual tax assessment from Multnomah County, which was $7,500 in 1913. By comparison, an entire smaller steamboat, the Truant (60 feet long, 33 gross tons), was built not far from Tillamook Bay, in Toledo, Oregon in 1910 for $6,000. An alternative plan, to run from Astoria to Tillamook was tried, but this did not work out and for some time prior to January 1913, the yacht had been out of service and moored at Bayocean. =Deal is reached= In January 1913 it was reported that negotiations for the sale of Bayocean might open soon with a resident of southern California who was considering running a vessel from San Diego to ports in northern Mexico during the summer. On Friday, March 21, 1913, Potter Realty Co. sold Bayocean to the Bayocean Excursion Company, a California-based concern organized by shareholders of the North Pacific Steamship Company. The new owners were seeking vessels to use in connection with the Panama–Pacific International Exposition to be held in San Francisco in 1915. At the time of the sale, Bayocean was at the Bayocean resort dock in Tillamook Bay, where the yacht had been wintered since the 1911 summer tourist season. The transfer to California was expected to take place about a month after the sale, or as soon as weather conditions became favorable. The new owners were seeking other vessels for use as ferries to the exposition, and according to one report, \\"many vessels held along the Coast for want of a suitable route will no doubt find their way south.\\" The newspaper account of the sale mentioned the Victorian, a notorious white elephant, then in Puget Sound, as a possible vessel to be acquired. The Potter Realty Company sold Bayocean to a corporation organized by San Francisco resident H.J. Cocoran, who had formerly been associated with North Pacific Steamship Co. Cocoran was seeking vessels for use in the 1915 fair in San Francisco. =Voyage to California= On April 3, 1913, Captain James J. Rudden sent a telegram from Bayocean resort to Portland, stating that the yacht had loaded a \\"plentiful supply\\" of gasoline on board, that he expected to leave port the next, and would proceed direct to San Francisco without stopping at any port en route. Bayocean departed a few days later, on April 6, 1913, with Captain Rudden in command, J. Oligreen as first officer, and Frank Coulter, chief engineer. The weather was stormy and there was a heavy sea, but the yacht was making good speed when last seen from Bayocean resort. Bayocean arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday, April 8, 1913, at 10:35 pm, having spent 60 hours en route from Tillamook. Service on San Francisco Bay In April 1913, Captain Rudden was superseded as master of Bayocean by Capt. Charles McNeill, Jr. During May 1913, Bayocean was making sightseeing excursions twice daily in the San Francisco Bay. However, there appears to be no record of any activity by Bayocean in any civilian capacity after mid-1913, and it may have been the vessel was laid up after that time. Government service Bayocean in naval service, between 1918 and 1920. Four sentries are visible in this image, one nearest the bow carries a rifle. =Bought by Navy= After the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, the U.S. naval purchased a number of large private yachts, including Bayocean, for use as patrol vessels. On April 27, 1918, Bayocean was inspected and found suitable for naval use. The Naval paid $52,500 for Bayocean. Bayocean was delivered to the Navy in June, 1918. =Naval operations= On April 27, 1918, Bayoean was inspected and found suitable for naval use. On June 24, 1918, the Navy bought Bayocean from J.T. Bunn of San Diego, California. Navy identification number 2640 was assigned to the yacht. Bayocean then proceeded from San Diego to the Mare Island Navy Yard, where the vessel was commissioned on August 16, 1918. Lt. Vinal S. Terry, USNRF, was placed in command. During naval service, Bayocean had a complement of 25 and was armed with two 3-pounder guns. Bayocean was then ordered to San Diego, California to report to Commander, Division 2, Pacific Fleet, for \\"such duty as may be assigned.\\" On September 12, 1918, following repairs and trial runs, the yacht was moored at the Municipal Pier in San Diego. For over a month afterwards, Bayocean operated in the San Diego area, conducting drills, running engineering trials, and carrying mail. On October 19, 1918, the yacht was docked for repairs, where it remained until November 7, 1918. The yacht was in port at the time of the armistice on 11 November 1918. On November 19, 1918 Bayocean was dispatched to the Pacific coast of Mexico, reaching Pichilinque, on the afternoon November 25, 1918, and delivered mail and supplies to Challenge (SP 1015), Oil Barge No. 9, and the submarine chasers SC 304 and SC 305. Bayocean then received orders to reconnoiter the Gulf of California and to confer and cooperate with the American and British consuls. Thereafter the yacht called at Mazatlan, Manzanillo, Guaymas, and Acapulco, returning to Pichilinque on December 8, 1918. American Vice Consul John R. Gamon boarded Bayocean at Acapulco to begin his return to the United States. On January 20, 1919, Bayocean returned to the United States. On February 1, 1919, at 12:30 pm, Bayocean got underway for San Francisco Bay, where upon arrival on February 3, 1919, the yacht was docked next to Farragut (Coast Torpedo Boat No. 5). Bayocean was decommissioned on 14 March 1919, and its name was struck from the Navy list on 13 October 1919. =Sold by Navy= In 1921, Bayocean was offered for sale by auction off by the Navy together with 145 other surplus vessels, including a number of steam and motor yachts which had been taken in for war service. The former yacht was then located in the 12th Naval District, at Mare Island. The appraised value according to the 1921 Navy auction catalog was $30,000, even though an earlier report, from December, 1919, placed the appraised value at $20,000. The Navy stated it would accept the highest bid above $6,000. According to one source, Bayocean was purchased by Mr. L. Parker, of Oakland, Calif., on 5 August 1921, and delivered to him on 16 September 1921. Another source reports that Bayocean was acquired by the San Francisco firm of Crowley Launch and Tug, a firm which remains in business today as Crowley Maritime.

As a board member of Mitre's CEE effort, he worked on standardizing event expression formats and providing interoperability between different logging systems. He used his software projects as testbeds for IETF standardization including rsyslog for the development of RFC 5424, RFC 5425, and RFC 5426. He implemented RFC 3195, the syslog over RFC 3080 protocol. Later, Gerhards designed the Reliable Event Logging Protocol, and its predecessor Simple Event Transport Protocol (SETP). Open Source Projects In 2004, he started working on rsyslog project and later on other open source logging projects, including Project Lumberjack, Adiscon LogAnalyzer, liblogging, and librelp on Linux system logging infrastructure. From 1988, he had started working on the open source projects during his early career. He wrote a library for portable graphics as well as a portable data exchange tool (cugcpio) and released it as public domain software. This code was distributed on Diskette by the C User's Group. Closed Source Projects In 1996, Gerhards wrote the first syslog server for Windows, that was launched by his company, Adiscon. In 1997 he wrote the first ever Windows Event Log to syslog forwarding tool and invented this class of software. The tool EventReporter never made a prominent share in the market, but was a base for Gerhards and other developers to create similar tools. While developing this tool further, Gerhards designed a forwarding tool for Microsoft Internet Information Server log files, based on a paper by him and Dr. Tina Bird.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they investigate a series of diamond thefts committed by a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by co-showrunner Jeffrey Bell and directed by Roxann Dawson. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Theatrical actress Pascale Armand won the guest role of the former agent, Akela Amador, who received her own musical theme from composer Bear McCreary consisting of a musical representation of her name. In general, the music for the episode was expanded from earlier scores for the series. Filming for the episode took place in Los Angeles, as well as on location in Stockholm, Sweden for the episode's opening sequence. \\"Eye Spy\\" originally aired on ABC on October 15, 2013, and as watched by 11.60 million viewers within a week. The episode received a mostly positive critical response, with Armand's performance praised. Plot In Stockholm, Sweden, a group of identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are attacked in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases were randomly assigned, so no one knew which contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out with her eyes closed. Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead after she led a failed attack on one of Mr. Vanchat's gulags. In Zloda, Belarus, Amador uses the diamonds as payment for a proxcard to access the Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover to be coming from a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye. Ward eventually finds Amador's goal: a mysterious diagram in a room of the Todorov Building. Coulson tracks down Amador's handler, but he is killed instantly by his own prosthetic eye. Now wearing an eyepatch, Amador is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Though Coulson promises to testify for her, she is just happy to be free. Production =Development and casting= Marvel Television announced in September 2013 that the fourth episode of the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was titled \\"Eye Spy\\", and had been written by co-showrunner Jeffrey Bell, with Roxann Dawson directing. Marvel also confirmed that the episode would star main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Brett Dalton as Grant Ward, Chloe Bennet as Skye, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, and Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons. Theatrical actress Pascale Armand got the role of Akela Amador a week after auditioning, and received the episode's script the night before traveling to Los Angeles. In preparation for the role, Armand watched The Avengers (2012), and took gym classes. About working on the show, Armand said \\"The pressure is always on for me to do my best work, no matter what I do. That’s just who I am. It started to seep in just how big this show was while I was working on the set, when I went to Stockholm, Sweden and coming back home to [New York City]. was talking about the show and there were posters everywhere advertising it ... It was my first time on a set that big, having such a sizable role.\\" =Filming and visual effects= Location filming for the opening sequence took place in Stockholm, including at Sergel's Square Filming occurred from August 20 to August 29, 2013. Like the rest of the series, the majority of the episode was filmed in Los Angeles, such as on the Universal Studios backlot and at Golden Oak Ranch, but the opening sequence was filmed on location in Stockholm, Sweden, including at Sergel's Square. The Sweden filming was directed by the series' second unit director Garry A. Brown. Armand filmed her scenes in Los Angeles initially and returned to New York, before flying to Sweden for those scenes, in mid-September 2013. Replicas of the Sweden train and station were created in Los Angeles using a New York City subway car and digital set extensions. To create Amador's backscatter X-ray imagery, visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack learned through research that people would look \\"white and doughy with no features\\", with clothing appearing as an outline or transparent. He asked costume designer Ann Foley to create the costumes out of clear plastic, for the actors to wear over red Morphsuits. By inverting what was filmed with the actors in these outfits, Kolpack was able to create the backscatter effect. =Music= Composer Bear McCreary called his expanded use of the orchestra in the episode \\"the real star of this score\\", and noted that when executive producer and writer Jeffrey Bell heard an early version of it, he compared it to the work of Bernard Hermann. McCreary highlighted the opening and climactic action cues as striking the \\"perfect\\" balance between \\"contemporary instrumentation and traditional scoring\\". The episode saw several variations of the series' main theme played, including triumphantly when \\"Ward blasts his way out of the building\\", with trumpets and French horns offering \\"soaring statements\\" of it; and in a \\"bouncy little statement\\", for which trumpet player Malcolm McNab used a broken harmon mute that \\"rattles and buzzes like nothing I’ve ever heard\\". The Agents theme, first introduced in \\"0-8-4\\", was also used \\"at the end of the episode, [when] Coulson and Skye find a moment of [peace] and unwind ... this theme always represents the emotional bond between our protagonists\\", and so was more appropriate for the scene than McCreary's themes for Coulson and Skye. McCreary \\"stripped out all the guitars and percussion from the first version we heard and arranged it solely for con sord strings and a few woodwinds.\\" Bear McCreary's theme for Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name For the episode, McCreary composed a theme for the character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged \\"so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis. The melody basically suggests that you sing along with her name ... I also put two of the A’s and the D in Akela Amador’s name on those exact notes ... Starting with this association with her name was a fun way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to my needs throughout the episode.\\" The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she \\"reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak.\\" Release =Broadcast= \\"Eye Spy\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on October 15, 2013, after first screening early at the New York Comic Con on October 12, 2013. It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on CTV, while it was first aired in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 on October 18, 2013. It premiered on the Seven Network in Australia on October 16, 2013. =Home media= The episode, along with the rest of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s first season, was released on Blu-ray and DVD on September 9, 2014. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. On November 20, 2014, the episode became available for streaming on Netflix. Reception =Ratings= In the United States the episode received a 2.8/8 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 2.8 percent of all households, and 8 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 7.85 million viewers. The Canadian broadcast gained 1.78 million viewers, the third highest for that day and the eleventh highest for the week. The United Kingdom premiere had 2.38 million viewers and in Australia, the premiere had 1.05 million viewers, including 0.9 million timeshifted viewers. Within a week of its release, the episode was watched by 11.60 million U.S. viewers, above the season average of 8.31. =Critical response= Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B+', feeling that the series was \\"getting better with each new episode, and now that it’s been picked up for a full season, I’m genuinely excited to see where the show goes from here. “Eye Spy” is a big step in the right direction, delving further into the history of these characters while laying groundwork for future stories. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t need superheroes to be a captivating TV series, and making sure the human elements are developed is the best way to guarantee the show’s success.\\" He felt that Armand \\"does impressive work depicting the mental toll of Akela’s experience, and her intensity early in the episode makes for a poignant final moment when she lays down in her prison cell, finally at peace after years of torment.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.9 out of 10, praising the \\"darker and edgier elements\\" of the episode, the Akela/May fight, and Ward's storyline, pointing out that \\"some viewers have found [Ward] to be dull. I actually quite enjoyed Ward’s material in the pilot, and this episode was an especially nice spotlight for him ... He got some nice action beats along the way and one of the funnier moments of the episode\\". He did, however, criticize the fact that half of the team members are unready for combat, stating \\"3 out of 6 team members being unready for combat is 2 too many.\\" Will Salmon at SFX scored the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, feeling that \\"The 'agent gone bad' is a hackneyed trope, but this works, largely because of Pascale Armand’s strong, understated performance\\" and praising the opening sequence as being \\"wonderfully eerie\\", comparing it positively to Doctor Who and The Avengers. Graeme Virtue at The Guardian praised the more focused, personal stakes of the episode, noting that \\"it's easier to cheer for scrappy underdogs than a huge, militarised Big Brother organisation like SHIELD\\", as well as Grant Ward's storyline, but criticized the episode's use of Bear McCreary's score, calling it \\"backgrounded\\". Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode for its much more realistic (compared to previous episodes) familial environment, complete with tension, as well as the character of Akela Amador and the fact that \\"Agent Coulson was at the center of the action, where he belongs\\". Den of Geeks James Hunt surmised that \\"Agents of SHIELD is definitely getting better and that's the main thing to take away from this episode. At this rate it should actually be quite good (rather than forgivably average) by Christmas. Let's hope the viewers last that long.\\" Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the episode \\"had an overall cohesion not previously in evidence\\", but criticized it as unambitious, noting that \\"stripping the Marvel concept to its visual minimum makes little sense\\".

Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Louis Ozawa Changchien portrays the super-powered man, while Ruth Negga is introduced as Raina—the titular \\"girl in the flower dress\\". In addition, to support the episode's Hong Kong setting, actor Tzi Ma appears in a guest role as a Hong Kong agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Jeremy Zuckerman contributed performances on Chinese instruments for the musical score. The episode brings back elements from the series' pilot, and features ties to the MCU films. \\"Girl in the Flower Dress\\" originally aired on ABC on October 22, 2013, and was watched by 11.16 million viewers within a week. The episode received a mixed critical response. It was praised for being more mature than previous episodes and for featuring a Marvel-like superhero, but also described as \\"perfunctory\\" and \\"mellow\\" by some critics.  Plot  In Hong Kong, street performer Chan Ho Yin is convinced by the mysterious Raina to reveal his secret pyrokinetic abilities. When his S.H.I.E.L.D. monitor, Agent Quan Chen, discovers him missing the next day, Agent Phil Coulson and his team of agents are tasked with finding him. Quan reveals that Chan's location and abilities were leaked by the hacktivist group Rising Tide. Skye, a new civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee, was once a member of the Rising Tide. She traces the hack that released the information back to Miles Lydon, her secret boyfriend and Rising Tide contact. The team goes to confront Lydon, but Skye reaches him first; the two are caught together by Agent Melinda May and are taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Skye tries to defend them both, but turns on Lydon when the team finds evidence that he was paid for the information. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out the top of the building, while the others escape to safety. Coulson releases Lydon after fitting him with a S.H.I.E.L.D. bracelet that prevents technology use. Coulson then confronts Skye about her true motivation for joining S.H.I.E.L.D., and she explains that she is searching for information on her parents, who she believes are tied to S.H.I.E.L.D. in some way. Coulson agrees to let her stay on the team and to help her in her search, but makes her wear a bracelet like Lydon's. In an end tag, Raina visits a member of Centipede in prison and asks him to contact the \\"Clairvoyant\\".  Production  = Development and writing = Marvel Television announced in October 2013 that the fifth episode of the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was titled \\"Girl in the Flower Dress\\", written by Brent Fletcher and directed by Jesse Bochco. The episode was originally set in Japan, with a Japanese guest character. After testing filming at Los Angeles' Little Tokyo as a stand-in for Japan, the crew decided that this would not work well enough and the episode was re- written to feature a Chinese character so filming could take place in Los Angeles' Chinatown instead. The episode's end tag scene was originally meant to include Raina meeting with Ian Quinn, a villain from a previous episode in the season. This scene would have revealed that Quinn is a member of Centipede, but the writers felt it was too soon in the season to reveal this connection. The character Po was created to be used instead. Fletcher said that Quinn is \\"kind of a sane guy, to a certain degree [w]hereas Po is a little creepy\\". Speaking to the exchange between Coulson and Skye when he catches her with Miles, Fletcher spoke to the \\"underlying bond\\" that was developing between the two despite the situation, with Fletcher adding the relationship was \\"a real underpinning of the show\\". =Casting= Marvel confirmed in September 2013 that the episode would star main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Brett Dalton as Grant Ward, Chloe Bennet as Skye, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, and Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons. They also announced the episode's guest cast, including Louis Ozawa Changchien as Renshu Tseng, Ruth Negga as Raina, Austin Nichols as Miles Lydon, Shannon Lucio as Debbie, Tzi Ma as Agent Quan Chen, and Cullen Douglas as Po. The name of Changchien's character was later revealed to actually be Chan Ho Yin. Changchien speaks fluent Japanese but does not speak Cantonese, so after his character was changed to Chinese to support the episode's new setting the actor had a few days before shooting to learn his new lines phonetically. Ma previously guest starred on another Joss Whedon-created series, Dollhouse. Lucio reprises her role from \\"Pilot\\", appearing again as the Centipede doctor, Debbie. Jimmy O. Yang cameos in the episode. =Filming and visual effects= Filming occurred from August 30 to September 11, 2013. The opening Hong Kong scene was shot in Los Angeles' Chinatown. Magician Gregory Wilson was brought to set to assist Changchien with hand movement and placement to make his magic \\"believable\\". The Centipede lab was shot at the Los Angeles Stock Exchange Building. Chan Ho Yin's fire abilities were achieve through practical and visual effects. LED lights were used during filming to get the proper interactive lighting from the fire that would be added digitally. Special effects supervisor Gary D'Amico lit a boulder attached to a zip line on fire to simulate the fireballs, allowing visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack to composite the content together and enhance it further with additional digital fire simulations. It took about six hours for Changchien's burn prosthetics to be applied. = Music = Composer Bear McCreary wanted to introduce Chinese instruments into the score to support the Hong Kong setting, and collaborated with composer Jeremy Zuckerman who played the guzheng for the episode. McCreary found \\"the nearly ten-minute long action scene\\" at the climax of the episode to be \\"the real beast of this episode\\" and \\"one of the most challenging pieces [he had] composed yet for the series\\", calling it \\"pretty chaotic\\" and noting the difficulty the orchestra had in recording it. The episode also saw the return of several major themes, most notably the Centipede theme from \\"Pilot\\". McCreary refrained from using the theme until Raina is revealed to be working for Centipede, at which point he relies on the theme for the rest of the episode, playing it on \\"ominous low strings [with] the creepy bells stat[ing] it more quickly above\\". = Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins = The Extremis virus from Iron Man 3 (2013) and \\"Pilot\\" reappears in this episode, and is stabilized using Chan's platelets to prevent it from exploding in future episodes. The explosive that Coulson uses to enter the Centipede facility is similar to the one he used in Iron Man (2008), and he strikes a similar pose when using it.

Within a week of its release, the episode was watched by 11.16 million U.S. viewers, above the season average of 8.31. Following the episode's release, ScreenRants Andre Dyce reviewed the series' ratings performance so far, saying over 7 million viewers is \\"still a far cry from trouble on their own\\", but as the show \\"continues to slip in both viewers and demographics, the trend could become problematic.\\" He acknowledged that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had \\"some of the highest ratings in recent history\\" for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but the continued decrease in viewership since then was a sign of trouble for the series. He said, \\"A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience.\\" Dyce noted that fans of the MCU films had been expected to provide a \\"healthy viewership\\" for the series, and \\"enthusiasm seems to be waning\\" among those fans now. = Critical response = Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode 8.1 out of 10, calling it \\"pretty damn busy and quite fun\\", highlighting Skye's character development and the drama it caused, as well as the connections to \\"Pilot\\". He praised the \\"dark, but also necessary\\" deaths depicted, and concluded that the series \\"is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way.\\" James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be \\"mostly, quite good,\\" praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. \\"might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight\\", and the character of Raina, who he said was \\"the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea\\". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating, \\"I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use\\" but the character \\"bore almost no resemblance to an actual person\\". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, \\"perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight.\\" Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter found the episode to be better than the first three but said it \\"wasn't as good\\" as \\"Eye Spy\\", explaining that he did not care about Scorch by the end of the episode and found most of it to be \\"just so very ... perfunctory.\\" David Sims of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B-', stating, \\"I've defended this show against complaints that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show.\\" He did praise the visual effects in the episode, saying, \\"This week’s episode had a couple of very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool.\\" Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a \\"slow burn\\", and concluding that \\"Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of \\"Girl in the Flower Dress\\" but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate.\\" Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating \\"a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies.\\" Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series \\"has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone\\", and said that the episode \\"delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher for the rest of the season.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Girl in the Flower Dress\\" at ABC Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

As a result, his need to maintain a relatively low profile in his private life has relegated him to near obscurity in death as an artist. Graves experimented constantly with new media and techniques for expressing his art. His works include delicate watercolors, fine detailed portraits, impressionistic oils, sculptures in metal, and some techniques of his own invention. Graves claims to have invented \\"sculpted oil painting\\", where multiple layers of thick oil paint are placed on masonite and then cut away to create the image. His sculpted oil paintings were displayed in some of the trendiest galleries and art museums, including the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, which purchased some of his sculpted paintings after they had been shown there.

Giovanni Battista was initially trained by his father and then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Venice, where he would also teach from 1783 to 1807. He was made an academic in 1776. He was active throughout the Veneto, and also in Ferrara and Udine. Among his works were the ceiling of the church of Sant'Eufemia in the Giudecca. In 1776, he painted for the church of Fonte in Asolo. He painted Storia d'amore in villa Viola of Treviso; frescoes (1790) for the Palazzo Mocenigo a San Stae in Venice; frescoes (1804) for the Palazzo Filodrammatici of Treviso; and a Martyrdom of Santi Gervasio e Protasio (1822) for the church of San Trovaso in Treviso. In later years, he collaborated with the neoclassical quadratura painter Giuseppe Borsato. He also lost his sight in later years, but his impoverishment forced him to continue to paint.Encyclopedia Treccani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 17 (1974), entry on Giovanni Battista by Luigi Menegazzi.

Plot Krazy is riding away at sea on a life ring, perhaps from a ship that sunk. His life ring suddenly catches a large fish which promptly hurls him onto a tree on the shore. On that tree a spidermonkey picks up and places him on a platter which is then carried away by a cannibal chef. The cannibal chef carries Krazy to the chief of the cannibal tribe. The cannibal chief, however, finds Krazy not having enough flesh, and therefore refuses to eat him. The wife of the chief comes by and develops affection for him. To treat the cannibal couple for sparing his life, Krazy decides to entertain them by dancing and being the conductor of their orchestra. Krazy then conducts, and the orchestra is performing in a more upbeat fashion. The performance goes as planned until Krazy is approached by a cannibal woman who seems to be bothered by the music. When Krazy does not notice her, the woman kicks him. The kick sends Krazy airborne onto much of the orchestra who are most disturbed. The musicians gang on him but Krazy is able to escape. But while he runs, a double bass player grabs and shoots Krazy like an arrow projected by a bow. The cartoon ends with Krazy falling back into the sea.

It also provides tools for viewing and analysis of the data, allowing for identification of genes involved in various aspects of tumor progression. The goal of CGAP is to characterize cancer at a molecular level by providing a platform with readily accessible updated data and a set of tools such that researchers can easily relate their findings to existing knowledge. There is also a focus on development of software tools that improve the usage of large and complex datasets. The project is directed by Daniela S. Gerhard, and includes sub- projects or initiatives, with notable ones including the Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP) and the Genetic Annotation Initiative (GAI). CGAP contributes to many databases and organisations such as the NCBI contribute to CGAP's databases. The eventual outcomes of CGAP include establishing a correlation between a particular cancer's progression with its therapeutic outcome, improved evaluation of treatment and development of novel techniques for prevention, detection and treatment. This is achieved by characterisation of biological tissue mRNA products. Research =Background= The fundamental cause of cancer is the inability for a cell to regulate its gene expression. To characterise a specific type of cancer, the proteins that are produced from the altered gene expression or the mRNA precursor to the protein can be examined. CGAP works to associate a particular cell's expression profile, molecular signature or transcriptome, which is essentially the cell's fingerprint, with the cell's phenotype. Therefore, expression profiles exist with consideration to cancer type and stage of progression. =Sequencing= CGAP's initial goal was to establish a Tumor Gene Index (TGI) to store the expression profiles. This would have contributions to both new and existing databases. This contributed to two types of libraries, the dbEST and later dbSAGE. This was performed in a series of steps: * Cell contents are washed over plates with poly T sequences. This will bind Poly-A tails that exist only on mRNA molecules, therefore selectively keeping mRNA. * The isolated mRNA is processed into a cDNA transcript through reverse transcription and DNA polymerisation reactions. * The resulting double stranded DNA is then incorporated into E.coli plasmids. Each bacterium now contains one unique cDNA and is replicated to produce clones with the same genetic information. This is termed a cDNA library. * The library can then sequenced by high-throughput sequencing techniques. This can characterise both the different genes expressed by the original cell and the amount of expression of each gene. The TGI focused on prostate, breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers at first, and CGAP extended to other cancers in its research. Practically, issues arose which CGAP accounted for as new technologies became available. Many cancers occur in tissues with multiple cell types. Traditional techniques took the whole tissue sample and produced bulk tissue cDNA libraries. This cellular heterogeneity made gene expression information in terms of cancer biology less accurate. An example is prostate cancer tissue where epithelial cells, which have been shown to be the only cell type give rise to cancer, only consist 10% of the cell count. This led to development of laser capture microdissection (LCM), a technique that can isolate individual cell types individual cells, which gave rise to cDNA libraries of specific cell types. The sequencing of cDNA will produce the entire mRNA transcript that generated it. Practically, only part of the sequence is required to uniquely identify the mRNA or protein associated. The resultant part of the sequence was termed the expressed sequence tag (EST) and is always at the end of the sequence close to the poly A tail. EST data are stored in a database called dbEST. ESTs only need to be around 400 bases long, but with NGS sequencing techniques this will still produce low quality reads. Therefore, an improved method called serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is also used. This method identifies, for each cDNA transcript molecule produced from a cell's gene expression, regions only 10-14 bases long anywhere along the read sequence, sufficient to uniquely identify that cDNA transcript. These bases are cut out and linked together, then incorporated into bacterial plasmids as mentioned above. SAGE libraries have better read quality and generate a larger amount of data when sequenced, and since transcripts are compared in absolute rather than relative levels, SAGE has the advantage of requiring no normalisation of data via comparison with a reference. Resources Following sequencing and establishment of libraries, CGAP incorporates the data along with existing data sources and provides various databases and tools for analysis. A detailed description of tools and databases created or used by CGAP can be found on NCI's CGAP website. Below are some of the initiatives or research tools provided by CGAP. =Genomic Annotation Initiative= The goal of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project Genome Annotation Initiative (CGAP-GAI) is to discover and catalogue single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlate with cancer initiation and progression. CGAP-GAI have created a variety of tools for the discovery, analysis and display of SNPs. SNPs are valuable in cancer research as they can be used in several different genetic studies, commonly to track transmission, identify alternate forms of genes and analyze complex molecular pathways that regulate cell metabolism, growth, or differentiation. SNPs in the CGAP-GAI are either found as a result of resequencing genes of interest in different individuals or looking through existing human EST databases and making comparisons. It examines transcripts from healthy individuals, individuals with disease, tumour tissue and cell lines from a large set of individuals; therefore the database is more likely to include rare disease mutations in addition to high frequency variants. A common challenge with SNP detection is differentiation between sequencing errors with actual polymorphisms. SNPs that are found undergo statistical analysis using the CGAP SNP pipeline to calculate the probability that the variant is in fact a polymorphism. High probability SNPs are validated and there are tools available that make predictions as to whether function is altered. To make the data easily accessible CGAP-GAI has a number of tools which can display both a sequence alignment and assembly overview with context to sequences from which they were predicted. SNPs are annotated and integrated genetic/physical maps are often determined. =Cancer Chromosomal Aberration Project (CCAP)= Genomic instability is a common feature of cancer; therefore understanding structural and chromosomal abnormalities can give insight into the progression of disease. The Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (cCAP) is a CGAP supported initiative used for defining chromosome structure and to characterize rearrangements that are associated with malignant transformation. It incorporates the online version of Mitelman’s database, created by Felix Mitelman, Bertil Johansson and Fredrik Mertens prior to the creation of CGAP, another compilation of known chromosomal rearrangements. The CCAP has several goals: * Integration of cytogenetic and physical maps of the human genome * Generate a clone repository of BAC clones across the genome that are genetically and physically mapped * Develop a platform for parallel database correlation of cancer associated aberrations (Fluorescent in-situ hybridization(FISH)-mapped BAC clone database) * Integrating three cytogenetic analyses techniques (spectral karyotyping, comparative genome hybridization, and FISH) to refine defining nomenclature for karyotypic aberrations. There is cytogenetic information from over 64,000 patient cases, including more than 2000 gene fusions, contained in the database. As part of this project there is a repository of physically and cytogenetically mapped BAC clones for the human genome that are physically available through a network of distributors. The CCAP Clone maps have been mapped cytogenetically using FISH at a resolution of 1-2Mb across the human genome, and physically mapped using sequence-tagged sites (STS). The data for BAC clones are also available through CGAP and NCBI databases. =Other Resources= Listed below are some other resources available through CGAP. Digital Differential Display An early technique used by CGAP is digital differential display (DDD), which uses the Fisher exact test to compare libraries against each other, in order to find a significant difference between populations. CGAP ensured that DDD was able to compare between all cDNA libraries in dbEST, and not just those which were generated by CGAP. Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) The MGC provides researchers with full-length protein information from cDNA, unlike EST or SAGE databases which only provide the identifying tag. The project includes human and mouse genes, and later cow cDNAs generated by Genome Canada were added. SAGEmap SAGEmap is the database used to store SAGE libraries. Over 3.4 million SAGE tags exist as of 2001. Tools can be used to map SAGE tags to UniGene clusters, a database that stores transcriptomes. This allows for easier identification of a SAGE tag's corresponding sequence. In addition, there are tools associated with SAGEmaps: * Digital Northern is used to measure the expression level of specific genes, * SAGE Anatomic Viewer displays this information visually, and compares it between normal and cancerous cells, *Ludwig Transcript (LT) Viewer shows alternative transcripts and their possible associated SAGE tags, *mSAGE Expression Matrix (mSEM) shows gene expression levels throughout mouse development for different tissue types. Gene Finder The CGAP locates a gene or a list of genes based on specified search criteria and provides links to different NCI and NCBI databases. A gene can be searched for specifically using a unique identifier such as gene symbols and Entrez gene number as well as generally by function, tissue or keyword. Other gene tools accessible through the CGAP web interface include the Gene Ontology Browser (GO) and the Nucleotide BLAST tool. Gene Expression Tools cDNA xProfiler and cDNA Digital gene expression displayer (DGED) together are used to find statistically significant genes of interest that are differentially expressed within two pools of cDNA libraries, typically a comparison is made between normal and cancer tissues. Statistical significance is determined by DGED using a combination of bayesian statistics and a sequence odds ratio to calculate a probability. cDNA DGED relies on the UniGene relational database while the cDNA xProfiler uses a flat file database that is not available online. Outcomes and Future CGAP is now a centralised location for several genomics tools and genetic databases and is employed widely in cancer and molecular biology research. The databases established by CGAP continues to contribute to knowledge of cancers in terms of their pathways and progression. The transcriptome databases can also be used in non-cancer related research, as they contain information that can be used to quickly and easily identify particular sequenced genes. The data also has clinical impact, as cDNAs can be used to create microarrays for diagnosis and treatment comparison purposes. CGAP has been used in many studies, with examples including: * Characterising differences in normal and cancerous endothelial cell gene expression * Identifying irregular gene expression as markers for glioblastomas and ovarian cancer * Identifying gene expression specific to prostate tissue * Comparison of proteins expressed in normal and cancerous reproductive tissue In addition, the vast amount of data generated by CGAP has prompted for improvement of data analysis and mining techniques, with examples including: * Comparison of gene expression from multiple cDNA libraries * Improved techniques for mining EST libraries * Integral, large scale studies of human transcriptome analysis See also * War on Cancer * Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute * International Cancer Genome Consortium * The Cancer Genome Atlas References External links * CGAP slide presentation * CGAP Catalog of resources Category:Genomics Category:Medical genetics Category:Cancer ","title":"Cancer Genome Anatomy Project"},{"id":"43745796","text":"Erin Hoare (born 17 July 1989) is an Australian netballer.

He was a cousin of Bernt Balchen, and nephew of Oluf Christian Dietrichson, who had been with the Fridtjof Nansen expedition to Greenland (1888–89). Career In 1911, Dietrichson became a commander with the in Bergen Steamship Company (Det Bergenske Dampskibsselskap). When the Norwegian Navy Air Force was established in 1915, he became one of the pioneers. He started flying in 1916 and traveled to the United Kingdom in the spring of 1918 for further training. Later that year he became chief of the plane boat station in Kristiansand, a position he had until he died. Dietrichson participated in Roald Amundsen's North Pole expedition in 1925, which reached 87° 43' N.On 21 1925 May two Dornier Wal aircraft boats, N-24 and N-25, took off from Ny Ålesund on the island of Spitsbergen. N 24 was led by Dietrichson, with Lincoln Ellesworth as a navigator and Oskar Omdal as a mechanic. N 25 was led by Hjalmar Riiser- Larsen, with Roald Amundsen as a navigator and Karl Feucht as a mechanic. After 7 hours of flight, the expedition made an emergency landing due to motor difficulties. N-24 landed but was damaged. After 25 days the six man crew managed to fly back to Svalbard in the N-25. Disappearance Dietrichson disappeared together with a five crew on 18 June 1928 during the Roald Amundsen led rescue mission searching for Umberto Nobile and his crew of the missing airship Italia.

July 9, 1944) was a US Army Private during World War II. He took part in the Battle of Saipan and went missing in action sometime between June 15 and July 9, 1944. No one in his family knew what had happened to him until the Japanese nonprofit Kuentai Group found his remains while recovering remains of Japanese soldiers who died during World War II. His only living relative who knew him was subsequently found and genetic testing revealed that the remains were those of Bernard Gavrin, 70 years after his death. On September 12, 2014, he was finally buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Background Gavrin lived in Brooklyn in New York City when he enlisted in the army in 1940. He never married nor had children, but he had a nephew, David Rogers. In 1944, he was in the 105th Infantry Regiment, which formed part of the American invasion force which had landed on Saipan. Sometime between June 15 to July 9, 1944, during which his regiment suffered heavy losses during the Battle of Saipan, he went missing in action. On July 7, 1944, Gavrin was declared missing in action and presumed dead. Gavrin's nephew, David Rogers (12 years old at the time) was present when Gavrin's mother received a telegram notifying her of Gavrin's death. Rogers reported that \\"She let out a terrifying scream that I can still hear to this day\\". His remains were declared unrecoverable by the army in 1948. In 1950, his name was placed on the Brooklyn War Memorial. Discovery In 2006, the Japanese nonprofit Kuentai Group began recovering the remains of Japanese soldiers from World War II in the Philippines. The group subsequently expanded their search to include Saipan and discovered mass graves while searching in fields. Among the remains of many Japanese soldiers, they found three dog tags belonging to American soldiers—the other soldiers were identified as Army Pvt. William Yawney and Army Pfc. Richard L. Bean. On one dog tag, Bernard Gavrin's name was engraved along with his father's name \\"Max\\" as last of kin, and his home address. The Kuentai Group subsequently contacted the Bull Run Regional Library in Virginia with the aim of finding surviving relatives. Tish Como, who worked at the library, used public records in the library to find Bernard's nieces Marilyn Goldman and Beverly Newborn. They contacted David Rogers, Gavrin's nephew. The remains of the American soldiers that the Kuentai Group found were turned over to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command for DNA testing. Using genetic samples provided by David Rogers, Bernard Gavrin's remains were identified 70 years after his death. Burial On September 12, 2014, Army Pfc. Bernard Gavrin was buried in Arlington National Cemetery 70 years after his death. The Governor of New York ordered all flags on state buildings in New York be lowered to half-staff on Monday September 15, 2014.

These youth schools were located in each district or calpulli. Life in the telpochcalli Life in the telpochcalli was tough. From early morning strenuous activities began. The day began with a cold bath, followed by a controlled and extremely frugal meal. They had to memorize the songs which they offered as praises of their gods and practiced in the use of weapons such as the sling, and the macuahuitl. Students had other obligations, such as carrying the necessary materials to repair the temples (teocalli), and collectively working the fields for their livelihood. The Aztec world was characterized by the care the rulers put into the education system. Tenochtitlan schools were of two types, generally depending on the boys' social background: the sons of nobles attended the calmecac, an institution that was located within the ceremonial precinct, while the commoners known generically as macehualtin, and a few noble boys, attended the school for youths at the telpochcalli.Edward Calnek, \\"\\"The Calmecac and Telpochcalli in Pre-Conquest Tenochtitlan\\" in The Work of Bernardino de Sahagún: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico, J. Jorge Klor de Alva et al, eds. Albany: SUNY Albany Institute for Mesoamerican Studies 1988. which were located in each neighborhood (calpulli). Informal training Each family in Tenochtitlan regarded their children as a gift from the gods; children would continue the lineage, collaborate in the activities of the family and learn to respect their elders and venerate The Gods. Someday the family would celebrate their marriage, thus forming a new pillar in the social organization of the calpulli. It was very important that within the family that children learn in the generation of the universe, carried out by the supreme gods, the male and female energies had been joined to enforce the creation of life. Women therefore educated their daughters, while men instructed their sons; that way through the process of informal education which had been imparted in the family, children learned the appropriate behaviors and different etiquettes for each sex. From the age of three or four years, infants were to perform simple tasks with great restraint and obedience; as the years passed the work became more complex and with heavier tasks; that is how sons learned the crafts of their fathers, while girls learned the duties of their mothers, like cleaning the house, preparing food, spinning clothing for the family, etc. Initially, children who rebelled were threatened with spanking, which became effective when they showed further disobedience; later, if young boys displayed negative attitudes, parents applied painful punctures with maguey thorns, or they would semi-asphyxyate them with the smoke from burning chillies (preparing them incidentally, for future practices of self- sacrifice). On the other hand, young ladies who showed negative attitudes, such as flirting and taste for gossip, were forced to sweep at night out of the house, which was seen as worse than a beating.

It was formerly TVB Network Vision (previously TVB Pay Vision) and was a satellite pay-television platform. The company was renamed Big Big Channel Limited on 23 May 2017, and the satellite pay-TV platform ceased operation on 1 June 2017. When the closure of the satellite pay-TV platform was announced in January 2017, online piracy and internet television were cited as some of the reasons. The online platform targets younger viewers, and offers fans direct interaction with artists.  History  TVB has noticed that the popularity of the Internet and mobile phones has changed the viewing habits of a new generation of viewers. With the rise of social networking platforms, artists (especially non-first- and second-line artists) need to gain more exposure, so they are keen on social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram and act as Youtubers. By advertising themselves on these platforms, individual artists become more role-oriented and opinion leaders, and even run product endorsements and online shopping to earn extra money. Therefore, TVB deliberately explored this section, allowing its artists to directly contact fans on this platform. Big Big Channel officially launched its Android and iOS app on June 23, 2017, after a month of testing. At present, the main layout of Big Big Channel is divided into nine categories: the most HIT, live, artists, talents, cooking shows, foraging, dressing, parenting and post-natal. In addition, the platform also has a \\"currency\\" system. Internet users can purchase virtual tokens for the purchase of virtual treasures for artists. However, some artists still do not know whether the proceeds are all owned by themselves or need to be divided into TVB. In addition, TVB will also arrange some series to be exclusively broadcast on this platform. On May 7, 2018, their official online store, Big Big Shop, was launched.  Controversy Some people think that it is profitable to see social media on TV, and even the online rate is not missed. Individual TVB artists who promote on social media may need to reduce the exposure of other online platforms and create exclusive content for Big Big Channel. On June 1, 2018, the Communications Authority announced that TVB indirectly promoted Big Big Channel in five programs to mix programing with advertisements; the Bureau received 37 complaints. The Communications Authority finally decided to impose a fine of HK$300,000 on TVB for the first four of the five complaints, and issued a serious warning to the TV for one of the five programs. And because the channel Jade broadcast on Broadband TV showed one of the five complaints on the same day, the Communications Authority decided to advise Now Broadband TV.

Housed in the Hôtel-Dieu de Marseille building, which served as the city's primary hospital (Hôtel-Dieu) for over eight hundred years, the hotel opened on April 25, 2013, in conjunction with the ongoing Euroméditerranée project. The hotel is part of the InterContinental hotel chain, and it is the fourth InterContinental property in France. The building sits on the location of the Saint-Esprit Hospital, which was created in 1188. The next six centuries saw the hospital undergo considerable expansion, and the current building was inaugurated by Napoleon III in 1866. In 1963, the building was listed as a registered national monument on the ISMH (Inventaire Supplémentaire des Monuments Historiques).Inventaire supplémentaire des monuments historiques The last patients left in 1993, and in 2003, the hospital was acquired in preparation for development. The property is owned by Paris-based AXA Real Estate. 172 rooms and 22 suites are housed in the hotel, with prices up to $6,600 for the presidential suite.National Post Review of the InterContinental Marseille Hotel Dieu In addition, the hotel hosts two restaurants: \\"Les Fenêtres Brasserie\\" and \\"Alcyone Restaurant\\", the latter of which is one of four restaurants in Marseille to hold at least one Michelin Star.Michelin-starred restaurants in Marseille History The iron gates of the former Hotel-Dieu =Hospital= Though the Hotel-Dieu's predecessor was founded in 1188, the Hotel-Dieu in its previous incarnation was founded when the Hospital Saint- Jacques de Galice and the Hospital Saint-Esprit merged in 1593, thus becoming Marseille's largest and foremost hospital. Both hospitals had previously served Marseille in the Black Death epidemic of Bubonic Plague, which first reached Marseille in January 1348.De Smet, Vol II, Breve Chronicon, p. 15. However, the combined Hotel-Dieu first achieved widespread renown when esteemed French ophthalmologist Jacques Daviel made significant advances and developments in cataract surgery, when he performed an extracapsular cataract extraction in 1747 at the Hotel-Dieu. By 1753, the hospital needed substantial expansion to meet the needs of Marseille, and the current building was built under the direction of the court architect of Louis XV, Jacques Hardouin- Mansart de Sagonne. He was a grandson of the eminent Jules Hardouin-Mansart, a famed architect who represented the height of French Baroque architecture and power. Benefiting from the financial aid of Jean-Etienne Raymond, the project was completed in 1788, and the hospital did not need additional expansion until 1860. The period between 1860 and 1866 saw the Hotel-Dieu rebuilt and remodeled by renowned architect Felix Blanchet, and the transformed hospital was christened by Napoleon III in November of that year. =Hotel= In 1993, after 805 years of service, the Hotel-Dieu received its last patients, and was converted into a teaching hospital; the hospital completely closed in 2006. Throughout this time, several consortiums were bidding for the redevelopment of the Hotel-Dieu, and four years after the acquisition of the property from the hospital in 2003, it was announced that the site was to become a luxury hotel under the InterContinental brand. Construction and renovations began in 2010, and the rejuvenated Marseille icon reopened on April 25, 2013, about 825 years after the Saint-Esprit Hospital first opened its doors. The hotel's renovations were accomplished by French construction company Eiffage and were developed by Altarea Cogedim. =City Hall= The Marseilles City Hall (Hôtel de ville de Marseille) is located near the harbour port in the 2nd arrondissement and was built in the 17th-century building. The construction of this medium-sized hall dates back to 1653 when Gaspard de Villages, first consul, proposed to the municipal council to build a new city hall. On September 6, 1653, the committee responsible for the works opted to build this new building at the same location as the old one. Etienne de Puget, the bishop, blessed the first stone on October 25, 1653. Jean-Baptiste Méolans, assisted by the engineer Enéas Bilondelle, was responsible for the blueprints, but the lack of funding and the occupation of the city by Louis XIV’s troops in 1660 prevented the construction to go beyond the laying of the foundations. In 1666, Gaspard Puget, Pierre Puget’s brother, took over the project. François and Mathieu Pourtal (or Portal, both were stonecutters), Martinet, Levaquery and Martin Grosfils worked on the ornaments of the front side. Pierre Puget only realized the escutcheon placed above the main entrance in 1673. The current escutcheon on the front is a replica of the original escutcheon, which is currently kept in the Beaux-Arts museum. The building actually served as the official city hall in 1673, roughly 20 years after the first stone was laid. Between 1748 and 1752, Mansart de Lévy (Jacques Hardouin-Mansart de Sagonne), the last architect of his family, projected to rebuild the whole city hall, including the royal square in honor of Louis XV. This project was abandoned in favor of the reconstruction of the Hôtel-Dieu located in the backside. This architect had been commissioned on the spot by the king in 1752. His 1769 unsigned order left in Pierre Patte's famous register reads \\"Monuments built in France for the glory of Louis XV\\". This building project was little-known by art historians until it was identified in 1994 and published in 1996. Throughout January and February 1794, during the French Revolution, Marseille was known as the unnamed city (Ville sans nom), the hall narrowly escaped destruction as it was suspected to be the headquarters of the federalists. In 1914, architect Clastrier replaced the Mansart slate tiles, leaving a completely different design. These old roof tiles were featured in 18th-century engravings and paintings. The city hall is one of the few buildings in this district that was left undamaged by the 1943 German occupation. Following a decree of April 30, 1948, the building is part of the national heritage monument list. In 1996, a project to extend the monument and to renew the surroundings was submitted. The contest was won by architect Franck Hammoutène in 1999, and the works were completed in 2006. This allowed to renew a total indoor area of 8,300 m2 including a new consultation room, several new council rooms and a museum. The floor above these new rooms hosts a new public space offering 20,000 m2 between the Old Port and the Hotel-Dieu, making it the largest plaza in the city. Design Stairway of the hotel Similar to numerous other buildings in Marseille built during the corresponding time period, the Hotel-Dieu exhibited French Baroque architecture, while subsequent improvements added touches reminiscent of French Rococo and Neoclassicism, and later, the Second Empire Style. Like many French buildings, it has a French Garden; the ruins of a 12th-century chapel is buried under it. A cultural exhibition of the hotel showcases some of the artifacts recovered from the chapel, some dating back over 2200 years. The redevelopment of the Hotel-Dieu was acceded to by AAA Bechu Agency and local Architecture firm, Tangram. Despite the hotel's storied history, the interior is modernistic, reflecting the Art Deco style as well as the traditional colors of the Mediterranean, orchestrated by Jean-Philippe Nuel. The InterContinental also prides itself in its 750m² terrace which can comfortably ensconce 160 people. Furthermore, the five-story hotel features twelve meeting rooms with a combined 1000 square meters of event space. =Rooms= Out of the 194 Rooms and Suites in the hotel, 22 are suites; of which 15 are Junior Suites, 6 are \\"Prestige Suites\\", and one is a Presidential Suite. 72 Rooms, including all of the suites, overlook the Vieux-Port.

He was an elected member of the Urban Council of Hong Kong from 1953 to 1959. Early life and education on 3 April 1916, Au was born in Hong Kong. At age 10, Au's father died. Au and his sister, Norma, were home- schooled by his mother. By age 12, his mother also died. Au was educated at the Ching Hua College. Career In 1936, at age 21, Au left Hong Kong and went to Shanghai, China. Au studied business. His career started as a bank clerk at Mercantile Bank of India. His assignments advanced and he eventually became the head of the bank's currency arbitrage section. Due to Japanese occupation in China, it resulted in replacement of many bank personnel, including Au. Au and Mickey Markarov started a bicycle assembly venture. Eventually his business expanded into a tricycle taxi service. In February 1949, Au and his family subsequently returned to Hong Kong. Due to China on becoming a communist country, Au had no opportunity to liquidate or bring along any asset. In Hong Kong, Au started Dalen Export Company and his wife was his secretary. He then gradually started his own trading business, King Merritt & Co., in Hong Kong. In the 1940s to 1950s, refugees arrived from the mainland China into Hong Kong, causing population growth and the local government struggled to accommodate these new immigrants. With Au's interest in helping refugees, one of his greatest achievements was his central role via Reform Club of Hong Kong in initiating government sponsored construction of multi-storied buildings for refugees. He was an active member of the Reform Club of Hong Kong and ran in the 1953 Urban Council election. He also held various honorary positions in the Colony. By the mid 1950s, as a leader in Urban Council, Au led the planning of the North Point Estate, the first housing project undertaken by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA). In 1958, as a Senior Selected Councillor of Urban Council, Au showed Prince Philip the housing units of North Point Estate. He was also vice-chairman of the United Nations Association of Hong Kong in 1957. He held his seat on the Urban Council until retired in 1959. In 1959, Au gave up his successful export business and political career in Hong Kong and he and his family immigrated to the United States. Personal In 1944, Au married Mary Huang in Shanghai, China. Mary's father was Vladimir Golikoff, a Russian tea merchant. In 1945, Au's son Patrick Au was born in China. In 1959, Au and his family immigrated to the United States. In December 1964, Au was naturalized in the U.S. He resided in California. On 27 October 1993, Au died in California, U.S. He is buried in Albany, California, U.S. After Au's death, his son, Patrick Au, donated most of his personal records, business records, documents and press cuttings related to the Hong Kong Reform Club and photos to the University of Hong Kong Libraries.

Saeroen's first work for the company, it is a sequel to the 1940 detective film Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, and stars the social worker L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr (better known as Pah Wongso) as a man who comes under suspicion and must clear his name. This possibly-lost film was styled as a comedy. Premise Pah Wongso has come under suspicion and must clear his name. Production Pah Wongso (right) finds S Waldy and M Sarip under a bed in a scene from the film. Pah Wongso Tersangka was directed by Wu Tsun for the Batavia- (now Jakarta-) based Star Film, owned by Jo Eng Sek. The film was a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, a detective film which was directed and produced by Jo Eng Sek, one of the owners of the Batavia (now Jakarta) based Star Film. The earlier film, a popular success, had been written to cash in on the popularity of the Hollywood characters Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. It served as a vehicle for the Indo social worker L. V. Wijnhamer Jr., who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work, raising funds for the Red Cross to aid people in China and helping abandoned children. This black-and-white film was shot by Chok Chin Hsien, who had also handled the cinematography for Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman.; The story was written by Saeroen, who was signed from Union Film for this production.; Saeroen had risen to fame after writing the box office hit Terang Boelan (1939), and his works for Tan's Film and Union had likewise been successes. Production had begun by September 1941. Wijnhamer returned from the Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, and took up four different characters. Three further actors returned from the original film: M Arief, Primo Oesman, and R Sukran.; ; Further main cast members included Sylvia Hatjirah, S Waldy, and M Sarip. Of these, only Waldy, who had made his debut in 1940's Zoebaida for Oriental Film, had previous film experience.; ; Other cast members included Ma' Njai and Oemar.; Pah Wongso Tersangka emphasised comedy, rather than the detective story of the original. In an editorial in Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film, \\"S.\\" wrote that such ventures into comedy – a genre which had not developed in the Indies – was important for the film industry as it would provide appropriate viewing material for children. He deemed that the success of the comedic works of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Laurel and Hardy provided ample evidence that the Indonesian market would support comedies, and expressed hope that the film – which also featured singing – would \\"leave audiences rolling with laughter\\". Release Pah Wongso Tersangka was screened by December 1941, and was reported to be well received. Also advertised under the Dutch title Pah Wongso Keert Terug (Pah Wongso Returns), it was rated for all ages. An advertisement in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad promoted the film as \\"exciting\\", and emphasised the multiple roles taken by Wijnhamer. A novelisation of the film was published by the Yogyakarta based Kolff-Buning. Legacy As Pah Wongso Tersangka was screening in cinemas, Star was working on its next film, Ajah Berdosa, which was released in January 1942.; This proved to be the company's last production; with the Japanese Empire's invasion of the Indies in March 1942, all studios – including Star – were closed. When the domestic industry was revived in 1948, Waldy was the only cast member to return to cinema; beginning with Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum (1949), he acted in over forty films before his death in 1968. Pah Wongso Tersangka was screened as late as October 1947, but may now be lost. As elsewhere in the world, movies in the Indies then used highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

The film comprises six different stories of couples in a single-room brothel at a hotel in Singapore, spread over several decades. The film is marked as Singapore's first erotic film. At the same time, Khoo downplays the film's erotic themes, calling its ode to the national cultural trends \\"a look at Singapore through the decades. It's a homage to the country\\". Khoo dedicated the film to the late horror writer Damien Sin, who wrote Khoo's career-launching Mee Pok Man (1995). Principal photography began on 3 September 2014, at the Infinite Studios in Singapore. The $800,000 budgeted film was produced by Nansun Shi and Zhao Wei Films, and distributed and financed by Distribution Workshop. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2015 and travelled to the San Sebastián International Film Festival, Busan International Film Festival and Singapore International Film Festival before the director withdrew his submission for a rating for the film from the Media Development Authority (MDA) as the MDA had deemed that two scenes exceeded the film classification guidelines. Khoo didn't want any cuts for a commercial release of the film in Singapore and so the film was denied a commercial release as unrated films are not allowed for public release in Singapore. However, on February 25, 2016, the film was given a commercial release after an \\"international version\\" with subtle differences from the original was passed uncut with an R21 rating by the MDA.  Plot  The story starts just after the surrender of the British to Japanese troops in Singapore in 1942. Six stories of six different Japanese, Thai, British, Chinese, and Korean couples are set in the same hotel room, spread over several decades.  Production  Nansun Shi is producing the $800,000 budgeted film along with Zhao Wei Films, and Eric Khoo is directing the film based on his own co-written script with Jonathan Lim.

Director Khoo told Today Online about the casting: > I must say I'm really happy because finally, my characters have come alive. > And because it's been on the drawing board for so long. Also it's really > good to have the foreign actors come in because prior to that, it's only > been Skype calls.

Justin Chang of Variety wrote that the film's \\"conceptual poignancy isn’t matched by the execution onscreen\\" and that this \\"sex-a-thon winds up feeling like the wrong kind of grind\\". Reviewing the film on Screendaily.com, Wendy Ide found it \\"hampered by a wildly uneven tone\\", predicting that \\"the film’s prospects outside the festival circuit look slim\\". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter also found In the Room's tone \\"uneven\\", adding that the film's \\"intriguing idea\\" is let down by \\"the execution, particularly in the script and acting departments... the writing and performances [are] too lacking in subtlety to lend those ideas much of an intoxicating spell.\\" Singapore critics also criticised the film: Lisa Twang of The New Paper noted that the film was \\"hampered by an uneven tone. The comic and tragic elements do not always blend together well\\", giving it 3/5. Prabu Krishna Moorthy of AsiaOne awarded it 2.5/5: while praising its \\"marvelous idea\\" and successful \\"episodic approach\\", he found that \\"the film only provides a cursory look at different characters\\" whose \\"stories deserved more screen time\\". Zaki Jufri of inSing.com gave the film 3/5, finding that the film is \\"Khoo’s boldest work but its unevenness hampers from being one of his best.\\" Critic Eternality Tan gave it 2.5/5 and called it \\"Khoo's weakest film to date\\", \\"a huge misfire\\" and \\"at best a misguided attempt at interweaving disparate tales in one film\\", writing that he \\"felt second-hand embarrassment for Eric Khoo and his cast and crew who were present at the premiere\\". John Lui of The Straits Times also gave the film 2.5/5, calling it a \\"courageous try at mingling the history of Singapore with the lovemaking of its characters\\" while noting its \\"uneven\\" results, \\"with the fault lying mostly with the writing, which tries to be thoughtful and titillating at the same time, while succeeding at neither.\\"  References  External links * Category:Singaporean films Category:2010s erotic drama films Category:Films directed by Eric Khoo Category:Hong Kong films Category:Hong Kong erotic films Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films set in Singapore Category:World War II films Category:2015 films Category:2015 drama films ","title":"In the Room (film)"},{"id":"43746937","text":"Metamesia ptychophora is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Based at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge from 1964 until 1969, the company, with Toby Robertson as artistic director and Richard Cottrell as associate director, toured both nationally and internationally with a mainly classical repertoire, providing notable appearances of such actors as Ian McKellen and Timothy West. The company became closely associated with the Edinburgh Festival after its first appearance there in 1967. Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which Derek Jacobi and Dorothy Tutin made significant appearances. Eventually the company found a new home at London's Old Vic in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company. Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its Arts Council of Great Britain funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise. Early years, Cambridge and Edinburgh Iain Mackintosh, Richard Cottrell and Elizabeth Sweeting formed Prospect Productions in 1961 to present a summer season of plays at the Oxford Playhouse. A successful first season led to a further season in 1962. The following year, when the Playhouse closed for renovations, Prospect became a touring company associated with the Century Theatre. Toby Robertson directed the last play of the season, Vanbrugh's The Provoked Wife, with Eileen Atkins and Trevor Martin. The production opened the newly restored Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, North Yorkshire, then transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre, London. The success of the Oxford seasons prompted the idea that Prospect should present productions beyond the summer season each year. In 1964, with support from the Arts Council of Great Britain and Dr. George Rylands, Prospect became a touring company based at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge, with Toby Robertson as artistic director, Richard Cottrell as associate director, and Iain Mackintosh as administrator. Between 1964 and 1966 Prospect staged 15 productions, presenting well-known plays as well as several rarely performed Classics including Vanbrugh's The Confederacy, with Robert Eddison and Hy Hazell, to celebrate the third centenary of Vanbrugh's birth, and Etherege's The Man of Mode, and a number of new plays. Timothy West joined the Company in 1966 to play Prospero. Later that year Prospect had its first invitation to the Edinburgh Festival. Prospect's first Edinburgh Festival appearance in 1967 was with Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, Lila Kedrova playing Madam Ranyevskaya in Cottrell's production. The production transferred to London, where Kedrova won the Evening Standard Best Actress of the Year Award. 1968 saw the production of Prospect's first \\"musical\\" - Gay's Beggar's Opera, which was also the first Prospect show to be televised, and in 1969 the Company appeared for the first time at the Assembly Hall. At the 1969 Edinburgh festival Ian McKellen made his breakthrough performances with the company as Richard II (directed by Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Robertson), the latter in the play's first professional revival for 300 years and causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death. Timothy West appeared as McKellen's sparring partner in both those productions, which subsequently toured Britain and Europe before being staged at the Mermaid Theatre in London and breaking box-office records at the Piccadilly Theatre. Between 1967 and 1977 Prospect was invited to appear at eight Edinburgh International Festivals, and largely as a result of its close association with the Edinburgh Festival, Prospect was asked to tour abroad for the British Council, visiting the Middle East, Russia, Hong Kong, and Australia. Years of touring In 1969 the Company was asked to extend its touring to the large \\"No 1\\" theatres in the regions; at the same time the Cambridge Arts Theatre wanted Prospect to help in the formation of a new theatre company. As these two developments pointed in totally different directions with implications of a conflicting scale of work, Richard Cottrell left Prospect to become director of the newly formed Cambridge Theatre Company: Toby Robertson became director of Prospect, and its role as the UK's leading touring company was recognised, with its new name - The Prospect Theatre Company. Under Robertson, the company pioneered a style of production in which stage designs and setting were kept to a minimum, partly from the belief that Shakespeare's plays in particular benefited from an uncluttered approach; this style also suited the company's needs when touring regional theatres, for which flexibility of staging was essential. Emphasis was placed instead on quality acting and strikingly designed costumes, complemented by lighting and incidental music. Carl Davis composed several scores for the company, including for a modern dress production of Love's Labours Lost (1971), Pericles (1973), and Pilgrim's Progress (1974/5) which led directly to the musical War Music (1977) with words by Homer and Christopher Logue and music by Donald Fraser. From 1970 to 1976 four major productions were created each year. As the only major company touring nationally, the choice of repertoire tended to be drawn more from the classics at the expense of new work. But alongside several Shakespeare productions the company staged such plays as Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd, Charles Macklin's The Man of the World, Turgenev's A Month in the Country (with Derek Jacobi, Timothy West and Dorothy Tutin, who won two major acting awards for her performance), Chekhov's Ivanov, and Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun. A series of chamber works were commissioned, including Jane McCulloch's The Grand Tour for the Entry into Europe celebrations - an entertainment seen in London, Edinburgh, and the 1974 Brighton Festival. The strain of touring and meeting the increasingly high standards expected by theatre audiences throughout the country began to tell, and even with occasional London seasons either at the Round House or in the West end, it was felt increasingly desirable that Prospect should once again have a permanent and preferably metropolitan base to sustain its regional work.Rowell, p. 157 Joining the Old Vic The Old Vic Theatre, London Looking for a suitable London base, Robertson believed that the Old Vic would best meet the company's needs and would add lustre to its reputation. For two years he sustained a campaign for the Old Vic to make Prospect its resident company. For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged by other companies at the theatre; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including Hamlet with Derek Jacobi, Antony and Cleopatra with Alec McCowen and Dorothy Tutin; and Saint Joan with Eileen Atkins.Rowell, p. 158 In July the Governors of The Old Vic announced \\"a marriage that was all but a merger\\" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of The Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of The Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect. One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council - already funding the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company in London - could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.Rowell, p. 159 Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. The company played a five-month season from January to May 1978, adding Twelfth Night to their repertory, and a four-month season from September to December presenting The Rivals, The Lady's Not for Burning with Atkins, and King Lear with Anthony Quayle in the title role.Rowell, pp. 159-60 In December that year, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled \\"Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company\\".Rowell, p. 160 Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's Hamlet (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country), followed by Romeo and Juliet, and The Government Inspector with Ian Richardson. The following season, however, proved controversial: the double bill of The Padlock and Miss in Her Teens, to mark the bicentenary of David Garrick's death, and a revival of What the Butler Saw were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory. An internal report by Prospect now questioned \\"whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the [Arts Council] Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson\\".Quoted in Rowell, p. 160 Robertson was in effect fired from the post of artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him. The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw Macbeth with Peter O'Toole, The Merchant of Venice with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday. On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the Company, sealing its demise.Rowell, p. 161 In January the company left for its pre- arranged tour of Hong Kong and Australia. Appeals to the Council for funding to be reinstated were denied. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic staging The Merchant of Venice, then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.

Phipps himself sought his fortune in London, becoming involved in trading to the East Indies, West Africa and New England. Political career Having acquired an estate in west Wiltshire, Phipps was elected to Parliament in January 1701 as member for Wilton, but did not contest the seat at the general election in November 1701. In July 1702, he was elected as member for Westbury, but was swiftly unseated on petition. Thereafter, he played little active role in politics, though he gave evidence to the House of Commons in 1712 in defence of the Royal African Company.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690-1715, ed.

Its station code is NOQ. The other three adjacent railway stations are (station code APDJ), Alipurduar Court (station code APDC) and Alipurduar (station code APD). History During British rule, all links from the northern part of Bengal and Assam to the rest of India were through the eastern part of Bengal. The most important connection was the Calcutta–Parbatipur–Haldibari–Siliguri link first established in 1878 and then developed in stages (for details see Howrah–New Jalpaiguri line). During the nineteenth century, Lalmonirhat was linked to the Dooars. In pre-independence days, a railway track running via Radhikapur, Biral, Parbatipur, Tista, Gitaldaha and Golokganj connected Fakiragram in Assam with Katihar in Bihar. With the partition of India in 1947, all these links were lost. Indian Railways took up the Assam Link Project in 1948 to build a rail link between Fakiragram and Kishanganj. Fakiragram was connected to the Indian railway system in 1950 through the Indian portion of north Bengal with a track. The New Jalpaiguri–New Bongaigaon section was partly new construction, partly old line converted to broad gauge in 1966. The 265 km long broad gauge Siliguri–Jogihopa railway line was constructed between 1963 and 1965. Railway Map Northeast Zone Importance over other adjacent stations Most of the long-distance trains from other parts of India pass through and stop at New Alipurdur railway junction as it is connected with double track to Assam and the rest of Bengal. The older Alipurduar Junction was on metre-gauge track that was converted to broad gauge much later and fewer trains pass through Alipurduar Jn station. This station is the biggest railway station in Alipurduar.

The endowment also established the Sturgis Hooper Professorship of Geology. Closely affiliated with Lawrence Scientific School, the mining school operated for ten years with low enrollment then closed in 1875. History National awareness of unexploited natural resources accompanied the westward expansion of the United States, and in the 1860s it became evident to Louis Agassiz, dean of the Lawrence Scientific School, and Congressional Delegate37th through 43rd Congress Samuel Hooper that Harvard should develop a mining school. Hooper's endowment of $50,000 included funding to establish not only the School of Mining and Practical Geology but the Sturgis Hooper Professorship of Geology. The school opened in 1865 with faculty members from the Lawrence Scientific School, and Geologist Josiah D. Whitney was hired as the first occupant of the Sturgis Hooper chair. Whitney had begun a geological survey of California in 1860, a task that would not be completed until 1874. Upon his appointment to the Sturgis Hooper chair in 1865, he was given an unpaid, indefinite leave of absence and did not begin teaching at Harvard until 1875. In 1867 Whitney arranged for Raphael Pumpelly to become a professor of mining at the school, although Pumpelly did not begin teaching until 1869 and resigned his post in 1871. Whitney led an expedition of four students from the school to the Collegiate Peaks in 1869. The group included Whitney's friend, Yale University professor William Henry Brewer. During the trip, Mount Harvard and Mount Yale were named.The citation includes unreferenced information for April Fools Day. From its beginning, the school included a highly prestigious faculty. Unfortunately, enrollment remained low even when world-renowned geologist Raphael Pumpelly was hired. Pumpelly's resignation in 1871 further burdened the school as did Whitney's ongoing absences. The school closed in 1875, a year after enrollment dropped to zero. Members of the faculty returned to the Lawrence Scientific School where a degree in mining engineering was established. Course of instruction, 1865 A degree of mining engineer was conferred upon graduates who completed the following course of instruction: =First year= * Analytical Geometry * Descriptive Geometry * Surveying and Mechanical Drawing * French * German * Differential and Integral Calculus * Mechanical Drawing * Crystallography * French * German =Second year= * Mechanics * Physics * Chemistry * French * German * Mechanics * Descriptive Mineralogy * Analytical Chemistry * French * German =Third and fourth year= Coursework had not been determined in 1865, but attention would be given to the following subjects: :Geodesy :Geology and Physical Geography :Metallurgy :Mining Course of instruction, 1874 Lawrence Scientific School provided the first three years of engineering instruction for the degree of mining engineer.

Born in Athens, Greece, on 1 March 1944, he studied chemical engineering at NTUA. In 1967 and continued his postgraduate specialization in business administration at Athens University of Economics in 1969. He continued his postgraduate studies at the Imperial College of London from 1970 to 1974 where he obtained his diploma (DIC), and at the same university his doctoral diploma (PhD) in engineering in 1974. The same year he worked as post-doctoral researcher in Fluid Dynamics and Thermodynamics, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College of London and worked with the internationally renowned Professor D.B.Spalding, FRS, with whom he continued to work until the latter's death in 2017. He worked until 1984 at CHAM Ltd company as director of the Department of Aerospace (1976) and then (from 1977 onwards) as director of the Application Development all research departments of the company. In December 1982 he was elected professor in the School of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, University of Greenwitch, London and Director of the Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Process Analysis, a Centre he created with Prof.M.Cross,the Head of School.The Centre is still going strong in original research.. Since April 1983 he worked alongside as a Visiting Professor in Computational Fluid Dynamics Unit of Imperial College of London. From 1974 he worked as a technical consultant to many research centers and government institutions in many countries.He is recipient of many awards.In June 1980 he was awarded, by the Inventions Council of NASA, the Certificate of Recognition and an award for the \\"Creative development of innovative technology which is considered as a serious contribution with future consequences in aerospace and other fields of science\\". In 1985 he was elected Professor of Chemical Engineering, NTUA and the years 1990 and 1992 was twice elected Dean of the same department, a position he held until 1994. He was elected Rector of the NTUA twice, in 1991 and 1994.In 2006 and then in 2008 he was elected again Dean of the School of Chemical Engineering until 2010. In 2002 and 2003 he was Senior Visiting Professor of Applied Mathematics & Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge and Fellow of Selwyn College, University of Cambridge. He was a visiting Professor at Surrey University,Uk (2000-2010). In 1996 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Sofia, Bulgaria (Doctorate Honoris Causa). He was a municipal councilor in the municipality of Athens from 1994 to 1998. He was a candidate MP with the political party PASOK in B 'Athens in the 2004 national elections. Also, in the national elections on 6 May 2012 and in the elections for the European Parliament in 2014 participated as a candidate collaborating (although ideologically belonging to a different party) with the political party Independent Greeks. In July 2014 he disagreed with the president of the Independent Greeks Panos Kammenos about issues on Cyprus and has since left. He served as a councillor for the Municipality of Athens (1995-1999). His social activities in Greece and abroad are very well known through his publications in the national press and his appearances on TV. He has presented two TV series, one that lasted for years on Education (\\"The Educational and Cultural Files\\") and the other on Technology (\\"Human Works\\") , that promoted the notion of the “Universitas” as the place where Society reflects upon itself , and discussed the role of technology in the future of Humanity and the planet. Six years as Rector and eight years as Dean he organized dozens of social, cultural and political events, such as “The Athens Summit”, that attracted International interest and had as speakers, among others, Mikhail Gorbatchev, the then President of Cyprus Vassiliou, Simon Perez, Peter Ustinov, Neal Kinnock, and many more. Six years as Rector of NTUA and eight years as Dean of School of Chemical Engineering made him very competent in organising matters, such as research and coordination of projects and personnel. When he was elected as Rector, the University had a debt of 500 million drachmas. Six years later it had a surplus of 11 billion drachmas, as a result of organising research and managing the University Assets. The National Technical University of Athens became among the top in rank European Universities in obtaining competitive European Projects. The return of its other assets rose from below 1% to above 8%, a level at which it still is. As Rector he also established the concepts of Continuous Education, Service Laboratories (which offer, paid for, services to clients), the “Industrial Linkage” University Office. He also organised the Post- Graduate studies and introduced into the Engineering Curriculum topics in Humanities. The Library and all other Administrative functions were electronically organised and controlled via a sophisticated network of optical fibres. His laboratory of Computational Mechanics contributed to the improvement of the Athens air pollution (nefos), and has assisted local communities throughout Greece to improve their environmental conditions (examples include, the proper placing of a power plant in Lesvos, refusing the installation of a Chinese port in south Crete, installing a Centre for accident prevention and management in west Attica and performing the Seveso studies on behalf of the relevant Ministries). It is also worth mentioning, the development of an internationally Innovative Computer system, FIREMENTOR (see Internet), for the early warning and management of forest fires. He was co-ordinator of two European Projects in Energy Efficiency in Process Technology, and he was recently co-ordinating a LIFE project on e-Symbiosis. He has been a scientific partner in several others and in many Greek-funded ones. He is currently involved in sustainable Development (particularly at Texas A&M;) , and researches with his Ph.D. students alternative forms of Energy (wind turbines, fuel cells and photovoltaics). His contribution to teaching is also considerable, and his views on modern educational tools have found support in the student population.He is currently teaching at Texas A&M; University \\"Computational Sustainability topics\\" and at National Technical University of Athens \\"Computational Fluid Mechanics\\", at post-graduate level. He has clear ideas on Education, Culture and the role of the University in the modern era, which he has published in the national press of Greece and presented in Scientific Conferences in Europe. Among his other activities, a very important one was the development under his leadership of “The Lavrion Technological Park”, as an incubator of innovation and Culture Educator. This Park links today University Research and Market Development.An effort was also made to create the “University of Alexander the Great” in Alexandria, Egypt, at the premises of the old Hellenic Schools there. Although the project started successfully it was never accomplished because of problems the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had.

The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument. History The mill was built in 1836 for Hermannus Dijk, who was later killed in an accident in the city of Groningen. The mill was sold to the Sikkens family, and remained in their ownership until at least the mid-1990s. As well as grinding wheat, the mill was also a pearl barley mill. A whirlwind severely damaged the mill on 20 1930, blowing the sails off and damaging the stage. The pearl barley stones were removed in the 1930s. At one point, the mill was fitted with Patent sails. The mill ceased working commercially in 1961 and was threatened with demolition. However, it was decided that the price quoted was too expensive and the mill remained standing. It was restored in 1971 by millwright Doornbosch of Adorp, Groningen. The alternative name of Rust Roest was only given to the mill in the late 20th century. The mill was sold to the Stichting Erfgoed Kollumerland en Nieuwkruisland in the mid-1990s. It was restored to full working order in 1999. Description The Munnekekezijlstermolen is what the Dutch describe as a \\" stellingmolen\\" . It is a smock mill on a three storey brick base, there is a stage at second floor level, above ground level. Attached to the base is the brick shed housing the auxiliary engine. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails, with the Fok system on the leading edges. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast in 1870 by De Prins van Oranje of 's Gravenhage, South Holland. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 59 cogs. This drives the wallower (33 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 85 cogs. The great spur wheel drives two pairs of millstones via a lantern pinion stone nut which have 28 staves each. The millstones are and diameter. A third pair of diameter millstones is driven by the auxiliary diesel engine.

He is best known for his work on Charles XII's Stair at Katarina Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Emigration to Sweden Roth family legend had long speculated that Benjamin was either hired or conscripted to serve as a blacksmith for the army of Charles XII of Sweden when it marched north from Saxony to invade the Russian Empire and that he returned to Sweden with other surviving members of the Swedish army after their defeat by Peter the Great. This narrative conflicts with records of his marriage to a Swedish woman in 1704 and the fact that Saxony was not defeated and subsequently allied with Sweden until 1706. Also, records indicate that the few Swedish soldiers that were not either killed or captured in Russia fled south with Charles XII and did not return with him to Sweden until 1715. This means that either: A. Benjamin's emigration to Sweden happened sometime before 1704 and was unrelated to Saxony's alliance with Sweden or; B. The records that indicate a marriage date of 1704 are incorrect. Their first child was born in August 1707 so an actual marriage date of sometime in 1706 is possible. Life in Sweden Benjamin settled in the part of Stockholm called Södermalm where he worked as a master farrier. He married Catharina Berg, the daughter of Swedish locksmith Lars Olsson Berg, in 1704. They had 7 children: Maria, Catharina, Carl, Benjamin, Christina Charlotta, and Margareta and one unnamed child who died either in birth or infancy. In addition to their home in Södermalm, an estate inventory in 1763 indicates that they owned two small stone houses between Baggensgatan and Västerlånggatan in Gamla Stan (Old Town), Stockholm. Benjamin was a member of the German parish and eventually became an alderman in Stockholm's farriers guild. Roht vs. Roth None of the sources relating to Benjamin Roth or his son Carl speak to or explain the alternate spelling of Roth found on Karl XII's stair. It may be due to that in the past names had different spellings in different languages. (I.E. Karl in Germany, Karl or Carl in Sweden, Charles in England, Char in France, Carolos in Latin, etc.) It may simply have been spelled Roht in Saxony and Roth in Sweden, and the family eventually formally adopted the Swedish spelling. Benjamin's Admiration for Charles XII of Sweden Karl XII:s Trappa Sometime between 1712 and 1715 Benjamin was commissioned to forge a railing for a staircase at Katarina Church in Södermalm. The stair was dedicated to Charles XII of Sweden and his royal monogram appears above the dedication date. He is also mentioned in the poem that is engraved on the pillars on either side of the stair. This double staircase leads from the cemetery up to the southern entrance of the church. It was dedicated in 1715 and he was paid 300 riksdaler for the work. The railing was renovated by Benjamin's son, Carl Roth, in 1776. File:Charles XII Stair, post 26.jpg File:Charles XII Stair, post 27.jpg File:Charles XII Stair, post 28.jpg Tradition of Carl Benjamin named his first son Carl in honor of the king of Sweden, Charles XII. This began a tradition in House Roth where some or all of the male children (usually at least the oldest) were named Carl and were commonly known by their middle names. This tradition has persisted within certain branches of House Roth for over 300 years to present day: The youngest being Carl Eben Roth, son of Carl Jan Christian and Stephanie Roth, born 2019.

General The aims of peer-to-peer insurance are to save money through reduced overhead costs, increase transparency, reduce inefficiencies, and especially to reduce the inherent conflict between insurance carriers and their policyholders at the time of a claim. There are many types of peer-to-peer insurance. The first type was created by an Insurance broker (as opposed to insurance companies). In this broker model, insurance policyholders will form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid flow into a group fund, the other part to a third party insurance company. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. For claims above the deductible limit the regular insurer is called upon. When there is no insurance claim, the policyholder gets his/her share refunded from the group pool or credited towards the next policy year. If the group pool happens to be empty, a special insurance comes into force. More recently, models created by insurance companies have arisen. The insurance model is similar to the broker model except that as the peer-to- peer provider is the actual insurance company. If the pool is insufficient to pay for the claims of its members, the insurance carrier pays the excess from its retained premiums and reinsurance. Conversely, if the pool is \\"profitable\\" (i.e. has few claims), the \\"excess\\" is given back to the pool or to a cause the pool members care about. Peer-to-Peer insurers take a flat fee for running the operations of the insurance enterprise. The fee is not dependent upon how many (or how few) paid claims there are. A group can be set up by the policyholders, forming a social network somewhat like Facebook. In the broker model, the only requirement is that all group members must have the same type of insurance. Examples are liability insurance, household contents insurance, legal expenses insurance and electronics insurance. In the carrier model, the only requirement is that the group members have something in common, such as being members of the same club or believing in the same charity. In the broker model, the peer-to-peer insurance concept carries no costs other than the special insurance. The providers are financed through brokerage commissions of insurance companies. In the carrier model, the peer-to-peer insurance concept carries no cost other the fixed fee to the carrier's management and the cost of reinsurance and other more minor expenses. Historical One of the earliest peer-to-peer insurance brokerage models was developed by the German Alecto GmbH, Berlin. In 2010, this brokerage version peer-to-peer-insurance- model was first introduced in the German insurance market under the brand Friendsurance. Large insurance companies such as R + V as well as large investors such as technology investors Horizons Ventures and the European [Regional Development Fund] (ERDF) were also won over for this model. The background to the development was the high number of insurance damage claims in Germany. The peer-to-peer approach aims to strengthen the sense of responsibility towards the group while minimizing the number of fraudulent cases. In 2011, Friendsurance was awarded the \\"Service Innovation Award Insurance\\" and nominated as \\"Startup of the Year 2011\\" in a startup competition hosted by online startup magazine \\"Gründerszene\\". In 2012, Oscar Health Insurance launched in New York City. In 2013, about 90 percent of those who took advantage of the peer-to-peer-insurance model were repaid contributions. In 2014, the British insurance company Guevara introduced the peer-to-peer insurance concept for car insurance in the UK., whilst Friendsurance, in cooperation with the insurance industry, expanded the peer- to-peer insurance concept to include existing insurance policies whilst keeping price and service for the existing policy unchanged. Also in 2014, P2P Protect Co., Ltd. (Chinese name 人人互保）was registered in HongKong in October 2014 as the Holding Company for a Peer to Peer Insurance model targeting at bringing transparency, claim fairness and pricing at cost to the insurance industry. In 2015, PeerCover launched in New Zealand, Riovic launched in South Africa, In the Czech Republic, PRVNÍ KLUBOVÁ pojišťovna (The First Club Insurance Carrier) started in September 2015 as the world's first peer-to-peer insurance carrier. TongJuBao.com, a Peer to Peer Quasi Insurance model focussing initially at covering social risks, was launched in China through a fully owned operating company incorporated in Shanghai in May 2015. The platform was launched operationally in November 2015 with a product range referred to on the platform including Marriage Safety, Child Safety and Family Unity. In 2016, Huddle Insurance launched in Australia, initially with a peer- to-peer model of insurance, with plans to expand into peer-to-peer lending in the future. Besure, a Canadian company from Calgary, and Otherwise in France has also announced their launch for 2016. These companies advertise they can reduce costs and bring transparency to the industry. Darwinsurance in Italy is listed as the first Italian company who launched peer to peer insurance model in 2016. The platform was launched operationally in March 2017 with travel insurance underwritten by AIG and ERV.  Empowerment  Participants in peer- to-peer insurance are given more control over their coverages. Control ranges from allowing peers to form their own risk pools for deductible coverages to allowing peers to make decisions about the proceeds of the pool to allowing peers to adjudicate their pool's claims. These decisions are traditionally made by the insurance carrier.

It served the Burbong and the surrounding area, which is part of the locality of Carwoola to the east of Queanbeyan in the Monaro Region of New South Wales, Australia. History The station opened as \\"Molonglo\\" on 8 September 1887, being just west of the crossing of the Molonglo River. It was renamed \\"Burbong\\" on 1 January 1890. The station was closed on 20 January 1975. The station building is on the northern side of the railway line, close to the Australian Capital Territory. It is in New South Wales, because the Territory- State border runs along the northern edge of the railway land at this point, not along the railway as is sometimes assumed. The boundary was drawn to ensure that all of the Bombala railway remained part of New South Wales. On 21 March 1979, a woman was killed and her son injured in an accident at the level crossing with the former course of the Kings Highway at Burbong. Aboriginal name The name \\"Burbong\\" is from the Australian aboriginal name, in the local language, for Goulburn.

India Pakistan released on 8 May 2015 to mixed to positive reviews from critics and audience and ended up with a successful venture at the box office. Plot India Pakistan is a story of how two young advocates Karthik (Vijay Antony) and Melina (Sushma Raj) counter many fights and fun together. Living in rented rooms in the same building, they lock up each other, fight, hide in each other's study, and sneak out of each other's cases, trying to prove they are a better advocate than the other. They travel from place to place, regarding a village dispute case. In the end, Melina decides to encounter the villain for the sake of two young lovers of the village. Karthik and his friends save her by playing a tactful game with the villain, who claims a DVD in which an encounter is shot. Karthik, Melina, and the others solve the mystery and unite when they confess their love for each other.

Filming began in April 2014 and was shot straight for sixty days. Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Thamizh.  Soundtrack  Critical reception The Hindu's Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\" India Pakistan is one of those not-so-bad films, thanks to solid contributions by M.S. Baskar...and Manobala...I wished we’d seen more of them and less of the lazy comedy track written around Jagan. N. Anand has a knack for the absurd. I’d be interested in watching a pure comedy by him — but please, nothing more than a couple of hours\\". The Times of India gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\" India Pakistan is the kind of film that you might not feel compelled to watch, but if you do catch it, you might not mind it. It is unremarkable in every way with its share of problems but still manages to be a mildly diverting entertainer\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Stronger in content than style, India Pakistan, is ideal summer fare. It strikes the right chord for the most part and is one of the better comic capers to appear in recent times\\". Sify wrote, \\"Director Anand has made India Pakistan in such a way that the film is highly entertaining and it happens mainly because of the characterization and dialogue deliveries of both MS Baskar and Pasupathy who rocks big time\\", going on to label it \\"a pucca commercial comedy entertainer which is tailor-made for family audiences\\". 'Southern Cinema Leaks' gave 3 stars out of 5 and stated, \\" India Pakistan is a masala romantic-comedy movie, also attempted to make the thrilling experience over the course of this movie. Vijay Antony and debutant Sushma Raj are done best performances that they can do for such a script. Pasupathy and M.S.Bhaskar are perfectly fit for their roles. So, anything that could have been to make this flick much better that should have been done by the director, N.Anand, who failed to keep the momentum\\". Bangalore Mirror wrote, \\"The film is indeed a breezily funny rom-com and the first time filmmaker has served it plateful, most of the scenes being enjoyable most of the time\\", rating it 3 out of 5.
