It has been first described in 2014 on the basis of its morphology from a collection of specimens gathered in 1986. As its taxonomic affinity among animals was unclear, it has been further identified in 2016 as a siphonophore by barcoding and phylogenomics from RNA material from new specimens. The specimens are presumed to represent parts (bracts) of the entire siphonophore, which has not been identified yet.  Discovery  The Dendrogramma specimens were collected off the south-east coast of Australia during a scientific expedition in 1986. They were collected at water depths of and on the continental slope near Tasmania, using a sled that was dragged over the sea floor to collect bottom-dwelling animals. The researchers were immediately struck by the unusual characteristics of the 18 specimens they collected. These were preserved in formaldehyde, and later in ethanol, for further study. On returning to the sample site in 1988, the researchers were unable to find any further specimens. It was not until 2014 that they published the discovery. Jean Just of the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the trawling in 1986, has explained the long delay before publication in terms of the extraordinary nature of the discovery: \\"Once you think you have something really extraordinary, it takes a long time to study, read, consult left, right and centre, and convince yourself that you‚Äôve really stumbled across something special.\\" When initially discovered, Dendrogramma's relationships were unclear. The two purported species were assigned their own genus, Dendrogramma, and family, Dendrogrammatidae; and the researchers even considered putting them in their own phylum. As they put it, however, \\"we refrain from erecting such a high-level taxon for the time being, because new material is needed to resolve many pertinent outstanding questions.\\" The lead scientist of the identification effort, J√∏rgen Olesen of the University of Copenhagen, suggested that they represent \\"an early branch on the tree of life, with similarities to the 600 million-year-old extinct Ediacara fauna.\\" At least three genera of Ediacarans‚ÄîAlbumares, Anfesta, and Rugoconites‚Äîshare similarities with Dendrogramma; all three appear to have possessed a disc with an internal network of forking channels. This possibility generated considerable excitement: Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge stated that the discovery is \\"a very interesting surprise, and it poses lots and lots of questions.\\" He noted the \\"most intriguing similarity to certain Ediacaran forms,\\" but cautioned that \\"the similarities are exactly that. They are intriguing rather than compelling.\\" Genetic identification was not possible with the original specimens, as they were preserved with formaldehyde and alcohol, a method that does not preserve nucleic acids suitably for most analyses. Consequently, in 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration named it as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species\\" for new species discovered in 2014. In late 2015, an expedition aboard the RV Investigator rediscovered the organism and collected 85 specimens in a manner that allowed genetic analysis, putting an end to the prior speculation.  Naming  The genus name Dendrogramma derives from the two ancient greek words (), meaning \\"tree\\", and (), meaning \\"drawing, mathematical figure\\". It alludes to the branching pattern of the digestive canals, which resemble dendrograms, i.e., branching diagrams frequently used by biologists to illustrate the evolutionary relationships among organisms. The specific name enigmatica of the type species refers to the mysterious nature of the organisms, while discoides ‚Äî the species epithet of the second species ‚Äî alludes to the disc- like shape of the animals.  Description  Preserved specimens of Dendrogramma. The specimens first collected were roughly mushroom-shaped, and with a mostly asymmetrical structure. So far no sex organs or nervous system has been detected. The specimens consist of a flattened, somewhat circular disc and a stalk with what was originally interpreted as mouth on the end, surrounded by lobes. The \\"mouth\\" on the end of the stalk leads to what was presumed to be a digestive canal that forks repeatedly when it reaches the disc. The individuals have an outer skin, with what was taken to be a stomach separated from the skin by a layer of dense gelatinous material (mesoglea). The stalks measure up to 8 millimeters in length, while the disc ranges from 11 to 17 mm in diameter, although the original specimens experienced significant shrinkage in full-strength ethanol after measurements were made. There were originally thought to be two species, primarily differing in shape of the disc and proportional length of the stalk: D. discoides has a complete disc and proportionally shorter stalk (length about 10% of the disc diameter) while D. enigmatica has a notched disc and proportionally longer stalk (up to 70% of disc diameter). The species were later shown to represent varieties of a single species. Although they are now interpreted as detached bracts (parts) of the entire siphonophore (which, as stated above, remains unidentified), the specimens were first interpreted as free-living organisms, as they did not appear to show evidence of having been attached to something else, whether a surface or each other.  Relationships  Dendrogramma has a body plan similar to animals in the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora, but the observed specimens lack the stinging cells that define cnidarians and the tentacles that define ctenophorans. DNA barcoding based on mitochondrial (COXI and 16S rRNA) and nuclear ribosomal (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA) markers, combined to molecular phylogenetics based on sequences from 155 nuclear genes extracted from the transcriptome, indicate a relationship with the Rhodaliidae siphonophores. More specifically, Dendrogramma appears closely related to members of the families Agalmatidae (Agalma), Abylidae (Abylopsis), and Prayidae (Craseoa).

Whitehead came to the Cornhuskers from Scottsbluff, Nebraska and led the Huskers to back to back Big Seven Conference titles in 1949 and 1950. In the 1948‚Äì49 season, Whitehead teamed with guard Claude Retherford as the Huskers tied Oklahoma for the Big Seven title. After Retherford's graduation, Whitehead became the focal point of the Nebraska offense for 1949‚Äì50. Averaging 15.7 points per game (then a school single-season record), Whitehead was the only unanimous member of the Big Seven all-conference first team. He was also named an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press. Following the season, Whitehead became the first Nebraska player selected to play in the East-West college All-Star game. After graduation, Whitehead was drafted by the Chicago Stags in the seventh round of the 1950 NBA draft. Instead, Whitehead chose to play for the Phillips 66ers of the Amateur Athletic Union and in 1952 was named an AAU All-American. After his time with the 66ers, Whitehead entered private business. He also spent a season as an assistant coach at his alma mater. Whitehead was named to the University of Nebraska Athletic Hall of Fame and the Nebraska High School Sports Hall of Fame.

The many photos of the young girl stop abruptly: there are empty pages in the album, and no photos of a girl much older than ten. John May and others surmise that they were once a wife and daughter, but there are no records or leads, no names, dates or labels, no identification of any kind. He visits the pie bakery and obtains from one of the workers, who remembers Stoke, the address of one of Stoke's former lovers. He visits the woman and asks her if he had ever spoken of a wife or daughter. She says that he had never spoken of a family, and that he had left her for a lady who owned a fish and chips restaurant that Stoke frequented. John travels to where Stoke was living at the time and checks all the fish and chips in town until he locates Stoke's former lover, Mary, her adult daughter, and granddaughter. Mary discloses that Stokes is the father of her daughter, but that he left before he knew of her existence. Mary tells John that they cannot be considered Stoke's kin as \\"he never wanted a family.\\" She does, however, tell him he abandoned them and landed in prison. At the prison, a guard leads John to some letters Stoke never mailed, where he finds a letter from the young girl in the photo album, making it apparent that she is a daughter who was once part of Stokes' life and family. It contains the name \\"Kelly\\" and an address. Another involved search is fruitful: May finds Kelly Stoke, Stoke's other daughter, the daughter he knew. Kelly is taken aback to hear her father is dead, but shows hard feelings from her father's wild ways, and his abandonment of her and her mother when she was young. When May asks about her mother, seeking any leads to anyone connected with Stokes, Kelly discloses that her mother, the adult woman in the photo album and Stoke's former wife, had died three years ago. When May invites Kelly to the funeral, she displays hurt and resentment that are strong enough for her to decline. She gives him a photo of her father with Jumbo, taken when they were serving in the military in the Falklands. Jumbo remembers Stoke fondly, but shows no interest in the funeral. Jumbo refers John to several parks and shelters where he had seen Stoke last. John meets two homeless men there who agree to talk to him in exchange for a drink. However, they, too, show no interest in the funeral. Considering this the end of the line, John returns to his office to ready it for decommissioning. He receives a phone call there from Kelly who has accepted to be Stoke's next of kin. The later part of the film shows quiet scenes that depict John making small changes in his rigid routine: trying new foods and drinks, walking new routes, and being inspired by a story of Billy Stoke's bravado. John meets with Kelly to inform her of what she has inherited, and Kelly invites John to tea, which makes John smile for the first time in the film, under the promise that his loneliness will end. After shopping for some small gifts, he is hit by a New Routemaster and bleeds to death on the asphalt. However, there is no one to locate his next of kin, since the office has closed down. He is buried very close to Stoke's grave, at the same time Stoke's funeral is in progress. Stoke's funeral is attended by all the people John contacted throughout the film on his behalf. Kelly occasionally looks around for John, who was expected at the funeral he had planned, and whom she was to meet for tea after the funeral. As Stoke's military mates in their dress berets, the homeless men, his former wife and girlfriends, and both of his daughters, leave his grave site, Kelly looks over and sees attendants putting the last dirt on a new grave, not knowing that it is John. After Mays' funeral party departs, people begin to appear in the cemetery and walk to John's burial site. A large crowd gathers, and they are shown to be the people whose cases John worked while he was still alive.

History  Hallsville was served by a post office from 1828 until March 1930; its first postmaster was Zebulon Simpson. In 1736, Duplin County (then upper New Hanover County) was the destination of several hundred Ulster Scots (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of Swiss Protestants. They settled on a plot of land, 71,160 acres between the N. E. Cape Fear River and Black River, obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh Esq. of London - this tract included what would become Hallsville. The namesake of the Hall family, which had been living in the area since the mid-1700s, Hallsville was once the site of a plantation owned by Thomas Hall. Hall, who was also a prominent dealer of turpentine, owned 51 slaves, making him one of the largest slaveholders in the county at that time. Hallsville was the scene of a brief commotion when, on July 6, 1863, a retreating Federal cavalry detachment being pursued by Colonel Thorburn, the Confederate Commandant for the City of Wilmington, passed through. The Confederates had hoped that they could trap the Federals at the river, but they had already crossed before any plan could materialize. The 1890 Census puts the population of Hallsville at a mere 24 persons. In 1899, however, Hallsville became the upper-most loading point for the steamship Saint Peter, which made runs to the port of Wilmington. The primary export of Hallsville during this period was lumber and naval stores. The community, now being serviced by a steamship, saw a sudden, although marginal, population increase. The upper stretch of the \\"Northeast River\\", however, could be quite treacherous and was not conducive to frequent travel by steamship. When the Kinston Carolina Railroad Company laid track through the eastern portion of Duplin County in 1916, Hallsville was bypassed. With the incorporation of nearby Beulaville at the advantageous intersection of several major thoroughfares the following year, the importance of Hallsville was negated and the remainder of the community's population began dispersing, save but a few families. = Notable residents = Hallsville Baptist Church * William Hall (1741-1825) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Hallsville, North Carolina. Hall served as a Justice of the Peace in Duplin County, North Carolina in 1776. *Parker (P.D.) Robbins (1834-1917) Robbins, a black descendant of a Chowan Indian chief, fought for the North during the Civil War; he was a sergeant in a colored cavalry unit. After the war, he returned to Bertie County and was chosen to represent it at the State Constitutional Convention. Afterwards, he served in the State Legislature (1869-1870) and became a postmaster at Harrellsville. An industrious man, Robbins was also a keen farmer and inventor, obtaining patents for two pieces of farm machinery. Robbins moved to Hallsville around 1879. There, he established a saw mill and constructed the steamboat Saint Peter, which he operated the remainder of his life. Robbins is buried in Duplin County. * James Sprunt (1818-1884) Born in Perth, Scotland, Sprunt had ambitions to emigrate to New York to teach. En route, however, his ship was damaged in a storm and forced to make an unscheduled stop in Wilmington, NC for repairs. While in Wilmington, Sprunt learned that the community of Hallsville was seeking a teacher. Sprunt accepted the position, teaching in Hallsville for five years before transferring to Grove Academy in nearby Kenansville. Sprunt served as the pastor for the 20th North Carolina Infantry during the Civil War, resigning in July 1863 due to dysentery. His post-war positions included both Duplin County Register of Deeds and County Clerk. Sprunt was also a successful botanist, selling many plants to the National Botanical Gardens in Washington, D.C.

Designed in the 1930s, it was the basic tractor of Polish anti-aircraft artillery during the 1939 Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland. There are only two surviving vehicles, both in private hands in Poland.  Development  The origins of the design can be traced to the Carden Loyd tankette of the 1920s. In 1929 Poland bought 10 or 11 Mark VI tankettes with a licence for their production, and used them for development of their own TK tankette series. In October 1931 Polish General Staff expressed interest in a small, highly mobile artillery tractor intended for 75 mm field guns in Polish service at the time. In 1932 Janusz ≈Åapuszewski and A. Schmidt of the BBTBP institute (\\"Armoured Forces Technical Study Bureau\\") designed a small, fully tracked artillery tractor based on TK-3 tankette. It was designed to tow 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, but could also tow other light and medium artillery used by the Polish Army, such as the modernised 75 mm Schneider guns and 100 mm Skoda howitzers. For heavier guns it was to be eventually replaced in Polish service with the PZIn≈º 343 wheeled tractor, but only a couple of these were completed before the war. Prototype of the C2P tractor after the second round of tests Initially designated C2T (CiƒÖgnik 2-tonowy, \\"Trailer, 2-Tonne\\"), the design looked promising and the following year the first prototype was constructed by the PZIn≈º works. The original C2P design was basically a TK-3 tankette razee: it included all elements of the undercarriage and traction system, with the armoured fighting compartment removed and replaced with a simple open cockpit with seating for four crew members: one driver and three passengers. The prototype was completed on 1 July 1933 and included some modifications to the Carden Loyd suspension designed for the TKS tankette. The prototype was a promising vehicle. The design, to some extent similar to French Renault UE tractors, was nevertheless both more advanced, more reliable and faster than its French counterpart. During trials it was discovered that in ideal conditions the C2P could tow a 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun at a speed of on a good road, and that similar speeds were achieved during cross-country trials. Earlier C4P tractors were significantly slower, towing the guns at . However, it was discovered that the rear of the vehicle was overloaded and that the vehicle's manoeuvrability was far from satisfactory. To counter the first problem, the rear tension wheels were enlarged, equipped with leaf springs and lowered to the ground, thus converting them to driving wheels. The problem with steering the tractor under heavy load was eventually solved by adding two steering clutches to both sides of the suspension system. The latter modification in 1938 was included also in the development of the TKS tankette (in the TKS-B variant). However, by then the serial production of TKS was stopped and in the end the C2P's undercarriage remained distinctive. However, as both designs were being developed simultaneously at the same facility, both were supervised by Rudolf Gundlach and their designers sometimes referred to the C2P as \\"ciƒÖgnik TKS\\" (TKS tractor), some sources call C2P a development version of TKS, which is not entirely true. C2P tractors towing the 40 mm Bofors guns during the May 3rd Constitution Day parade of 1939 After the second round of trials the prototype was also equipped with a simple windshield and a folding tarpaulin roof to protect the crew from rain or snow. On 20 January 1936 the prototype left the PZIn≈º factory for the third round of road tests. The vehicle spent the best part of February travelling across Poland with a 75 mm gun attached. In June and July the tests were resumed, this time with a fuel trailer, and again in September, towing the new Bofors 40 mm gun (Polish designation wz. 36 Bofors). Altogether the prototype covered over 4,000 km (2,500 miles) without a serious malfunction. On 15 February 1937 the trials ended and the C2P was proposed for serial production.  Production  Serial production was started in 1937 at the F-1 factory of the PZIn≈º holding at Czechowice near Warsaw. The C2P replaced TKS on the production lines, which meant that the production could start quickly, as both vehicles shared many components. According to newest research, until September 1939 no less than 316 were delivered to the Polish Army (earlier publications gave smaller figures).Bia≈Çkowski, Rafa≈Ç.

Additional 117 were on order, to be completed from December 1939 to 1940.  Operational history  Although initially designed for field artillery, in the end all C2P tractors were attached to anti-aircraft artillery units as the primary vehicle for towing the Bofors 40 mm gun, two for every gun: one towed the gun itself, the other towed an ammo caisson carrying 400 shells. Both trailers also carried the gun's crew of 5 (plus two drivers), as well as up to 160 shells. 292 tractors were used in regular units (with 31 A-type four-gun batteries and 11 B-type two-gun batteries).  Variants  In 1936 two C2P tractors served as the basis for the TKS-D tank destroyer prototypes.

The mission of the company was to build a central terminal in Dallas for the seven railroads then serving the city. The terminal company ownership expanded to eight railroads, each having a 12.5% share: the Texas & Pacific; the Frisco; the Rock Island; the Cotton Belt; the Southern Pacific; the Santa Fe; the Katy; and the Trinity & Brazos Valley. The company opened the Dallas Union Terminal in October 1916 and was also operating 5 miles of track within Dallas. At the peak of its usage, as many as eighty trains stopped each day at the station. The last passenger train departed the terminal on May 31, 1969, and the Union Terminal Company ceased doing business on March 13, 1974. Dallas Union Terminal is now called Union Station and is a DART Light Rail, commuter rail, and Amtrak intercity rail station. Triple underpass In 1936, the Texas Highway Department with funding from the United States Bureau of Public Roads built a triple underpass to separate the grade of the Union Terminal Company track and Elm, Main and Commerce Streets. Railroad employees witnessed the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza from the bridge on November 22, 1963.

Instead, the current Federal government of Mexico plans to build an international airport at Santa Luc√≠a airbase north of the city. Texcoco Airport was first announced in the State of the Union address of President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto on September 2, 2014. It was billed as the largest public infrastructure work in Mexico in a century. The new airport was set to replace current Benito Ju√°rez International Airport, the busiest airport in Latin America transporting 41.7 million passengers in 2016. The development of NAICM at Texcoco was planned in four stages. Phase I, was scheduled to open by October 20, 2020, would have consisted of one main terminal of and three independent runways, which would yield a capacity for 68 million passengers annually. In its final Phase (2065), NAICM would have consisted of six runways, an additional main terminal and two satellite terminals, with capacity for 125 million passengers, making it the second largest airport in the world today. The Master Plan was developed by the global engineering and consultancy company Arup Group Limited. The architectural project was designed in collaboration between Pritzker award architect Norman Foster ‚Äì whose works include Beijing Capital International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport ‚Äì and renowned Mexican Architect Fernando Romero ‚Äì whose works include Soumaya Museum. NAICM Texcoco construction was in process since 2016, and was managed by Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de M√©xico (GACM), a state-owned company fully owned by the Mexican Ministry of Transportation. GACM holds a fifty-year concession to build, develop, operate, and manage NAICM, and is also the parent company of the current airport AICM. In October 2018, in a non-binding referendum organized by President-elect Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, 69 percent of the 1.067 million voters (under 1% of the electorate) rejected the airport, choosing instead to build a new airport on the grounds of Santa Luc√≠a Air Force Base. Construction continued for several weeks, but on December 27, 2018, the government announced the official cessation of operations at the planned airport. It is unknown whether the airport will be finished and serve as a second airport to Mexico City, or if it will be sold off and used for other purposes.https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cartera/construccion-de-nuevo- aeropuerto-en-texcoco-esta-oficialmente-suspendida-jimenez-espriu/ Construcci√≥n de nuevo aeropuerto en Texcoco est√° oficialmente suspendida: Jim√©nez Espri√∫ Location The new airport was being built on a 4,432 hectare plot to the northeast of Mexico City, in the Zona Federal del Lago de Texcoco (part of the dry lake bed of Lake Texcoco). Given the proximity to the current airport (AICM), about 3 miles away, the opening of NAICM Texcoco would have required the complete shutdown of AICM and the immediate transfer of operations to the new airport - similar to Hong Kong and Munich.  Costs and financing  The total funding required for the construction and initial operation of the New Airport is estimated at up to US$13.3 billion, of which approximately 60% will be contributed by the Mexican government through the use of public funds, and approximately 40% is expected to be funded from a combination of bank loans and the offering of debt securities. The private financing for the development of NAICM at Texcoco was structured as a securitization drawing from passenger charges at the existing airport in Mexico City (AICM) and future passenger charges of the new airport, upon commencement of operations, without recourse to the Mexican government or the airport sponsors. GACM has implemented the Mexico City Airport Trust, a special purpose trust under the laws of Mexico to execute this financing structure. This collateral structure ensures that even if the project were to be canceled, the bonds would still be honored. In September 2017, the NAICM Airport Trust successfully placed US$4 billion in private debt securities. That includes US$3 billion in 30-year notes that are due in 2047 and yield 5.5 percent annual interest, plus US$1 billion in notes due 2028 that yield 3.875 percent annual interest. This adds up to last year's $2 billion bond issuance, which included a US$1 billion worth of 10-year bonds pay annual interest of 4.25% and US$1 billion worth of 30-year bonds pay annual interest of 5.5%. The green bond issuance (the second by Mexico) became the largest in Latin America and the first green bond from an emerging market to receive a Green Bond Assessment grade from Moody's Investors Service. Facilities The airport started the building process in 2015 with its starting phase. It is expected to put its first phase in operation in October 2020, however if everything goes according to plan, it is possible that demo operations could start as soon as possibly February or March . If completed as planned, the airport will have a passenger capacity of up to 68 million passengers and, if the master plan is completed in the following decades, up to 125 million people per year. At its first phase, the airport was to include: * One X-shaped terminal of 743,000 m2 capable of handling 68 million passengers with 96 gate bridges and 68 remote bridges * LEED certification * Three runways capable of triple- simultaneous landing and taking off * One control tower When completed, the airport's total facilities were to include: * Two terminal buildings * Two satellite buildings * Six runways capable of simultaneous operation Terminal design Fernando Romero with a model of the new airport. =X Shape= The X was symbolic of the country's name, \\"M√©xico\\". An X-shape is also considered efficient to extend the number of gates. The X shape is used in the airports of Abu Dhabi, Mumbai, Nairobi, Incheon, Pittsburgh, and SeaTac. =Roof= The roof was considered \\"airy, lightweight, and made of membrane\\". According to Foster and Partners: > With spans in excess of 100 meters, three times the span of a conventional > airport, it has a monumental scale inspired by Mexican architecture and > symbolism.

The project claimed it was \\"designed to be the world‚Äôs most sustainable airport\\".  Antecedents and protests  Because of the increasing traffic at Mexico City airport, President Vicente Fox announced the construction of a new, larger airport on of land in the municipalities of Texcoco and San Salvador Atenco in 2002, roughly where the new airport is planned today. When local violent protests took place, the new airport was cancelled. Prior to the 2014 announcement of the construction of the new airport, the government had purchased ejido land (agricultural land held in common by local communities), and the government now claims that it has no need to acquire additional locally held land to build the airport. Some local groups in Atenco and nearby communities differ, claiming that the federal government acquired the land through deception and strong-arming, and small- scale protests took place after the announcement. Post-closure According to the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT), cancellation of the project left a debt of US $6 billion in bonds and US $30 billion in securities, which will be paid off through the landing fees at the Benito Ju√°rez International Airport over a period of 19 years. The landing fees are US $23.80 for domestic flights and US $45.20 for international flights, the second-highest in the world (after Heathrow Airport in London. This is in addition to the $56.8 billion previously paid to the Mexico City Airport Group (GACM) as compensation for the cessation agreement of the fees. Airlines paid US $9.89 billion in landing fees in 2018. None of the money raised through the landing fees can be allocated for construction of the Mexico City Santa Luc√≠a Airport or the Benito Juarez International Airport. On July 10, 2020, it was alleged that Grupo Gilbert had frauduently won possession of 49,000 tons of steel that had originally been designated for the NAIM. On August 12, 2020, Hugo Bello, leader of the Confederac√≥n Libertad de Trabajadores de M√©xico, (Freedom Confederation of Mexican Workers) is arrested for kidnapping and the union's suspected involvement in embezzlement of money destined for construction of the now-defunct airport. Ecological Park Speaking for the Administration of President L√≥pez Obrador on August 25, 2020, I√±aki Echeverr√≠a said that the objective is to recuperate for the Lake Texcoco Ecological Parc by 2021. The idea is to recuperate natural areas and establish an animal refuge; will open to the public. Completion of the project depends on progress made against the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Echeverr√≠a said that the park will have areas for cycling, skating, group activities, visits to the nursery, open-air movie theater, and concerts.

Assembly and Formation As relations between Spain and the United States deteriorated in the spring of 1898, the leaders of the U.S. Army began to plan for its first large-scale campaign since the Civil War, which had ended more than 30 years previously. On April 15, 1898, the regiments of the Regular Army were ordered to various assembly points in the South, with only a handful of units to remain at their peacetime posts. Seven regiments of infantry were ordered to Tampa, Florida and Brigadier General James F. Wade assigned to command the assembled troops. Two weeks later, Brigadier General William Rufus Shafter, at the time commanding the troops assembling at New Orleans, was directed to Tampa and assume command. Five more regiments were ordered to Tampa on May 10 from Camp Thomas, Georgia (in the Chickamauga Battlefield Park), where the troops assembled had been formed into a provisional corps, the first command larger than brigade-size the Army had organized since the Civil War. Meanwhile, following the declaration of war, General Order 36 of May 7 had approved the organization of eight \\"army corps,\\" each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each. Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the new corps. Major General William R. Shafter was named as commander of Fifth Army Corps, which assumed control of the troops assembling at Tampa, Florida. Embarkation and Landing On June 7, the corps began embarking on transports for the landing in Cuba, although this took a week (due to a combination of poor organization by senior officers and fears of an attack by the Spanish fleet, which was capable of no such activity) and the fleet did not sail until June 14. Reaching Cuban waters without incident, the troops began landing at Daiquiri on June 22. Evacuation and Quarantine As the troops continued to suffer from disease, including yellow fever misdiagnosed as malaria, it was decided to return the men of Fifth Army Corps to the United States and a site on Montauk Point, Long Island was chosen, being convenient to the Long Island Rail Road and in theory, an easy location to quarantine; Camp Wickoff was established there and the corps completed its movement into quarantine camp on August 24, 1898. As men recovered, units were mustered out of service; by September 30, the corps strength was 218 officers and 5,136 enlisted men. Fifth Army Corps was \\"discontinued\\" on October 3, 1898.

It stars Scarlett Johansson, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt, Pilou Asb√¶k, Chin Han and Juliette Binoche. Set in a near future when the line between humans and robots is blurring, the plot follows the Major (Johansson), a cyborg supersoldier who investigates her past. Filming for Ghost in the Shell took place in New Zealand from February to June 2016, with additional filming in Hong Kong that June. The film premiered in Tokyo on March 16, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 31, 2017, in IMAX, 3D, IMAX 3D, and 4DX. It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual style, action sequences, cinematography and score, but criticism for its story and lack of character development. The casting of Caucasian actors, particularly Johansson, drew accusations of racism and whitewashing in the United States. It grossed $169.8 million worldwide against a production budget of $110 million. The film debuted at No. 2 on home media. Plot In the near future, humans are augmented with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength, and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or \\"shell\\", that can integrate a human brain rather than an AI. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO, Cutter, decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative. A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the counter-terrorism bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as glitches, is troubled by how little she remembers of her past. The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic geisha after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol and \\"dives\\" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line. Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Now with cybernetic eyes, Batou kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian. He urges her to question her own memories and to stop taking her medication as it actually helps to block her memories. Kuze then frees her and escapes. Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are implanted. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated. Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, ran away from home a year ago and was arrested; while in custody, Motoko took her own life. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects. Cutter deploys a \\"spider-tank\\" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his \\"ghost\\" with Killian's, but Killian refuses. Kuze fades out, then a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, now repaired and embracing her true identity as the Japanese Motoko, Killian reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9. Cast In the Japanese dub, Atsuko Tanaka, Akio ≈åtsuka and K≈çichi Yamadera reprise the roles they played in the Mamoru Oshii films and the Stand Alone Complex television series. Production In 2008, DreamWorks (who had handled U.S. theatrical distribution of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence through its Go Fish Pictures banner) and Steven Spielberg acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga. Avi Arad and Steven Paul were later confirmed as producers, with Jamie Moss set to write the screenplay. In October 2009, it was announced that Laeta Kalogridis had replaced Moss as writer. On January 24, 2014, it was reported that Rupert Sanders would direct the film, with the screenplay now written by William Wheeler. Wheeler worked on the script for approximately a year and a half, later saying, \\"It's a vast enterprise. I think I was second or third in the mix, and I know there have been at least six or seven writers.\\" Jonathan Herman also worked on the screenplay. Ultimately, credit for the screenplay was given to Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger. On September 3, 2014, Margot Robbie was reported as being in early talks for the lead role. On October 16, it was announced that DreamWorks had made a $10 million offer to Scarlett Johansson for the lead role, after Robbie had chosen to play Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad instead. In May 2015, Paramount Pictures agreed to co- produce and co-finance the film. On November 10, 2015, Pilou Asb√¶k was cast in the role of Batou. According to TheWrap, Matthias Schoenaerts was previously circling the role that went to Asb√¶k. On November 19, 2015, it was reported that Sam Riley was in early talks to play the villain role Kuze, leader of dangerous criminals and extremists, though on February 4, 2016, Variety reported that Michael Pitt had entered talks for the role. On March 3, 2016, TheWrap reported that Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano had been cast as Daisuke Aramaki, the founder and leader of the elite unit Section 9, tasked with protecting the world from the most dangerous technological threats. Principal photography on the film began on location in Wellington, New Zealand, on February 1, 2016. In April 2016, the full cast was announced, including Juliette Binoche, Chin Han, Lasarus Ratuere and Kaori Momoi. In May 2016, Rila Fukushima was cast in a role. Filming wrapped in New Zealand on June 3, 2016. Filming also took place in the Yau Ma Tei and Jordan areas of Hong Kong, around Pak Hoi Street and Woosung Street on June 7, 8 and 10 or 14‚Äì16. Release Ghost in the Shell was originally scheduled for release on April 14, 2017, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through their Touchstone Pictures banner. The film was part of DreamWorks' distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios, which began in 2009. In April 2015, Disney moved the film's North American release date to March 31, 2017, with Paramount Pictures handling international distribution. However, it was reported in September 2015 that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016. In January 2016, Disney dropped the film from its slate after DreamWorks finalized their distribution deal with Universal Pictures in December 2015. Disney's distribution rights for the film were transferred completely to Paramount instead of Universal, with Paramount retaining Disney's release date of March 31, 2017. The film was not screened for critics before its release. =Box office= Ghost in the Shell grossed $40.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $129.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $169.8 million, against a production budget of $110 million. In North America, Ghost in the Shell opened alongside The Boss Baby and The Zookeeper's Wife, and was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,440 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1.8 million from Thursday night previews and $7.7 million on Friday, which includes the preview number. The film opened to $19 million, finishing third at the box office, behind The Boss Baby and Beauty and the Beast. Deadline Hollywood attributed the poor opening to below-average critical reviews, an unclear marketing campaign, and no social media presence by Johansson. In its second weekend, the film grossed $7.4 million, dropping 60.4% and finishing 5th at the box office. Kyle Davies, domestic distribution chief for Paramount, felt the controversy around the casting had damaged reviews, and said: \\"...you're always trying to thread that needle between honoring the source material and mak[ing] a movie for a mass audience. That's challenging, but clearly the reviews didn't help.\\" Conversely, Deadline argued that the negative critical assessment was due to the film being \\"cold, boring, thoughtless, and the same old next to its futuristic ancestors The Matrix and Blade Runner,\\" and suggested that Paramount held the film from review because they \\"knew they had a lame duck.\\" Japanese box office reception since the official release in the country, on April 7, was more positive, earning $3.3 million during its first three days in theaters. In Japan, Ghost in the Shell made it to second place, just behind Sing. In China, the film debuted at number one, grossing in $22.1 million and claiming the spot from Kong: Skull Island, which had held it for three weeks. It performed below already muted expectations, leading to the Chinese media calling it a flop. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 293 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Ghost in the Shell boasts cool visuals and a compelling central performance from Scarlett Johansson, but the end result lacks the magic of the movie's classic source material.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visuals and production: \\"Some of that ravishment arrives courtesy of the movie's setting, a stunning pan-Asian metropolis that makes boldly inventive use of the Hong Kong skyline, its tightly stacked buildings tricked out with enormous holographic billboards. (The cinematography and production design, both staggering, are by Jess Hall and Jan Roelfs, respectively.)\\" Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film 3/4 and said, \\"This isn't jokey, quippy science fiction; true to the source material, it's fairly grave about the implications of an android- dominated culture, though of course Ghost in the Shell is also about giant mecha spiders equipped with machine guns.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \\"Just about every scene in Ghost in the Shell is a visual wonder to behold‚Äîand you'll have ample to time to soak in all that background eye candy, because the plot machinations and the action in the foreground are largely of the ho-hum retread variety.\\" Evan Narcisse of io9 commented that the film failed to capture the feel of the source material, with the biggest problem being the Major asking the wrong sort of existential questions about herself. Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku commented on the film's failure to adhere to the source material: \\"Somebody misjudged how poorly American superhero movie tropes would map onto Ghost in the Shell ... [the] final scene tried to do that 'satisfying our need for closure' thing American directors think is kind, but is actually condescending.\\" Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 1.5/4, stating: \\"Ghost in the Shell is a defective mess with lifeless characters, missed chances for thematic exploration and a minefield of political incorrectness.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times expressed disappointment at the absence of the original's \\"big, human, all-too-human questions\\" in contrast to the retention of action clich√©s, such as chases and gun fights. Dargis also criticized the absence of the unique setting, stating that \\"The original manga takes place in what‚Äôs described as a \\"strange corporate conglomerate-state called 'Japan'\\", while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers.\\" Nicholas Barber of the BBC described the film as \\"conceptually and visually breathtaking\\", an elaborately designed and detailed dystopia which seems disturbingly real. Peter Suderman of Vox and Emily Yoshida of Vulture criticized the removal of philosophical ideas from the story, feeling the movie westernized the story and changed the search for the idea of a soul to finding individuality and memories. Hanns-Georg Rodek of Die Welt newspaper praised the film for being an action movie that for once does not throw philosophy overboard. James Hadfield of The Japan Times argued that the film missed the mark, but was better than Hollywood's previous attempts at adapting anime for the big screen. The film has a 3.48 star (out of 5) rating on Yahoo! Japan Movies, with four stars for its visuals and three for its story. On April 10, 2017, The Hollywood Reporter noted that the adaptation's then 3.5 rating on Yahoo Movies Japan was higher than the 3.2 rating of the 1995 original anime film. =Home media= Ghost in the Shell was released on digital on July 7, 2017, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on July 25, 2017. The film was number two in the Top 20 NPD VideoScan First Alert chart and the Top 10 Home Media Magazine rental chart in the week ended July 20, 2017. Casting criticism The casting of Scarlett Johansson as Major Mira Killian / Motoko Kusanagi brought accusations of whitewashing. Pavan Shamdasani of Asia Times wrote: \\"The original is about as Asian as things get: Japanese cult manga, ground-breaking anime, Hong Kong- inspired locations, Eastern philosophy-based story. Most of that's been downright ignored with its big-screen adaptation, and Scarlett Johansson's casting as the dark-haired, obviously originally Asian lead sent netizens into a rage.\\" In April 2016, ScreenCrush reported that the filmmakers had commissioned the use of CGI and other visual effects testing to alter Johansson's appearance to make her appear Asian, spurring further backlash. Paramount stated the tests were short-lived and did not involve Johansson. Some fans and industry employees argued that the controversy was a symptom of Hollywood's fear that casting non-white actors would bring less profit. Marc Bernardin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the only race Hollywood cares about is the box office race\\". In Japan, some fans were surprised that the casting had caused controversy, as they had already assumed that a Hollywood production would choose a white actress. They felt the appearance of the protagonist was immaterial due to the franchise's themes of self-identity and the blurring of artificial and natural bodies. The Hollywood Reporter spoke to a group of female Japanese American actors, including Keiko Agena, about the film; the actresses argued that Japanese natives are not upset by the film because of white beauty standards held in Japan. According to Justin Charity of Ringer, \\"your average Japanese citizen's outlook on diversity is much less influenced by pluralism than the outlooks of many Asian Americans, who live in a country where popular culture rarely represents them well, if at all. Hence, many Japanese Americans may find Johansson's casting in a Ghost in the Shell movie distressing, while native Japanese observers make nothing of it.\\" Paramount released a featurette of Mamoru Oshii, director of the anime films, visiting the studio, in which he says that Johansson exceeded his expectations for the role. Oshii told IGN that the Major uses an assumed body and name, \\"so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her... I can only sense a political motive from the people opposing it, and I believe artistic expression must be free from politics.\\" During a launch event in Tokyo, director Rupert Sanders said of Johansson: \\"There are very few actresses with 20 years' experience who have the cyberpunk ethic already baked in. I stand by my decision‚Äîshe's the best actress of her generation.\\" Addressing the controversy, producer Steven Paul referred to the film's setting as \\"an international world\\" with characters of numerous nationalities. Sam Yoshiba, director of the international business division at Kodansha's Tokyo headquarters, which holds the rights to the Ghost in the Shell series, said: \\"Looking at her career so far, I think Scarlett Johansson is well cast. She has the cyberpunk feel. And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place... this is a chance for a Japanese property to be seen around the world.\\" Johansson said of the criticism: \\"I certainly would never presume to play another race of a person. Diversity is important in Hollywood, and I would never want to feel like I was playing a character that was offensive. Also, having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity. Certainly, I feel the enormous pressure of that‚Äîthe weight of such a big property on my shoulders.\\" The film attracted further criticism for its ending, which reveals that Johansson's character was originally a Japanese girl. The Media Action Network for Asian Americans accused Johansson of lying when she said she would never play the role of a person of a different race than her own. Japanese-American actress Ai Yoshihara, speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, said she felt the twist was \\"white people trying to justify the casting\\". Another Japanese-American actress, Atsuko Okatsuka, said: \\"Hanka Robotics [the corporation in the film] is making a being that's the best of human and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make happens to be white.\\" Accolades The film has been nominated in two categories for the Hollywood Post Alliance (HPA) Awards, and was also nominated for the 'Most Innovative Advertising' category at the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Awards. It won the 12th annual HPA Award for 'Color Grading'. The film was on the Academy Awards shortlist for the category of Visual Effects, and was shortlisted for Hair and Makeup, but was not nominated for either category. It was also nominated for Best Contemporary Make-up by the Make-Up and Hair Guild. On October 23, 2018, the film's composer Lorne Balfe received the \\"Top Film Score\\" award at the ASCAP London Music Awards.

Somehow, jazz pianist Uri Caine's masterful and magnificent interpretations of selected works of the 19th century classical composer Gustav Mahler work remarkably well... He does not simply \\"jazz up\\" Mahler, which would mock the greatness of his works. Instead, he worms himself inside the songs and harmonies and uses them as a starting point to create a related, but new, synthesis of his music. Jewish folk melodies, cantorial renditions, free jazz, and classical violin are all merged in a whole that transcends the parts\\". Gramophone said \\"What Caine has done is much more radical and controversial than anything in, say, Jacques Loussier‚Äôs Bach.

The organization is composed of Houston area volunteers, many of whom are hockey players, skating instructors, figure skaters, coaches and officials. History The first version of the STARskaters website went live on May 1, 2008. The Maple Leaf Pub in Houston hosted the first fundraising event on July 26 of 2008, and the first skating event was held at the Willowbrook Aerodrome on August 2 of 2008. The original concept was to hold quarterly STAR skates for organizations who provide services for individuals with disabilities, but the scope of the program quickly expanded to also include Sled Hockey. On February 14, 2009, the first \\"Sled Hockey Weekend\\" was held to recruit players and raise the awareness of the sport in Houston. The first STAR skate for ARC of Fort Bend County was held May 15, 2010 and was the first STARskaters event held at the Sugar Land Ice & Sports Center. This event lead to the first special needs skating lessons which started September 18, 2010. The special needs skating lessons were noticed by B.L. Wylie, the Parent Education Coordinator for the U.S. Figure Skating instructional program at Sugar Land Ice & Sports Center. As the mother of Olympic Medalist Paul Wylie and a veteran instructor for U.S. Figure Skating, B.L. had always envisioned creating a skating program for individuals with disabilities. In October 2010 she took over as Director of the program which is today known as SkateTherapy.org which has become a model program for rinks across the country for instruction of disabled skaters. Today, between the STAR skates, SkateTherapy and Sled Hockey programs, outreach and community involvement, more than 130 events are held annually. Mission STARskaters mission is to provide an on-ice experience for individuals with disabilities through their STAR skates, SkateTherapy and Sled Hockey programs. Paralympic Sport Club status In June 2011, STARskaters was invited to apply for status as a US Paralympic Sport Club. Sports clubs are community-based sports organizations developed to involve youth and adults with physical and visual disabilities in ongoing sports and physical activity, regardless of skill level. They also serve as a pipeline to develop athletes for competition in the Paralympic games held every two years following the Olympic games. After a review of the STARskaters program, Sport Club status was granted on July 21 of 2011. The first Paralympic Experience event was held at Ice Skate USA at Memorial City Mall on May 12, 2012 with Andy Yohe, Captain of the 2010 Gold Medal US Sled Hockey team participating in a \\"try Sled Hockey\\" event and providing instruction and skills and drills for players from Houston and Austin. Organization structure STARskaters is a 501(c)(3) non profit and 100% volunteer organization. There is a board of directors which oversees all of the programs as well as advisory boards for both the Sled Hockey and SkateTherapy programs. =Board of directors= *President ‚Äì Jim O'Neill *Vice President - T.C. Lewis *Vice President, Sled Hockey ‚Äì Andy Toppin *Secretary ‚Äì Lilia Quintana *Treasurer - David Seto Program details STAR skates ‚Äì Skating events held by request for organizations who service the disabled community. Events are held at area rinks for schools, service organizations and area US Paralympic Sport Clubs and youth wheelchair summer camp events. Sled Hockey ‚Äì A Paralympic sport, Sled Hockey is played by the same rules as stand-up hockey but with players sitting in specially designed sleds. They propel themselves with sticks which have picks on the end to dig into the ice. SkateTherapy ‚Äì A program designed to provide stand-up skating instruction for individuals with a broad range of physical and developmental disabilities. The program follows the U.S. Figure Skating 14 level badge program, and the program, started in Sugar Land, TX has become a model for other program development around the United States. =The Ice Cruiser and Jessie Chan= Jessie Chan always waited for the opportunity to give back the gift and passion of skating to others. In October 2013, at age 17, the opportunity presented itself in the form of a blind Skate Therapy student too terrified to take the ice, she had her chance. 5 months later, Jessie debuted her first original invention, the Ice Cruiser, a unique 360 degree walker that aids beginning skaters and those with physical and mental disabilities in learning how to skate independently. The multi-storied structure and all-around barrier design provides skaters with both the freedom and security to roam across the ice without the fear of loss of balance or direct collision with anyone or anything. The power of the first Ice Cruiser can be demonstrated in Shoureek, that same blind skater who once struggled to even stand on the ice in only the arms of his instructors. Now, Shoureek spends his Saturdays happily and confidently gliding across Skate Therapy ice on his own, the comfort of his own Ice Cruiser assuring him of the power he himself has to transform and grow stronger. Today, Jessie holds a provisional patent and has big plans for the Ice Cruiser. Recently, she got down to work with her dedicated team of SkateTherapy volunteers and constructed the first Small and Medium-sized Ice Cruisers to be donated to the Skate Therapy program. =Kyle Huckaby= When Kyle about 9, he started playing goalie in roller hockey, sitting on the floor playing against able-bodied players. This helped him begin to sharpen his hockey skills. Later when an ECHL hockey team came to the Beaumont area, he played goalie at a few junior practices. Again, sitting on the ice to play in goal against the able-bodied players. Kyle finally got his first sled when some adult hockey players were able to get a local refinery to donate money to purchase a hockey sled. However, he was only able to play in the sled a couple of times before the ECHL team left in 2008 and they no longer had ice. Kyle didn't play hockey on ice again until he was introduced to STARskaters at the Metal & Muscle Expo in Houston in the fall of 2011. After that meeting Kyle and his family made the long drive from Beaumont to Houston every weekend where Kyle started the day on the ice with Sled Hockey, then on to Wheelchair Basketball and other activities. In April 2012, STARskaters invited Kyle to play goalie in the USA Hockey Disabled Festival in Dallas. It was the first National Tournament for STARskaters Sled Hockey team and Kyle did double duty, playing for both the Houston adult team and in the Junior division for a team from Minnesota. His stellar performance in goal caught the eye of JJ O'Connor of USA Disabled Hockey. Kyle was invited to the National Development Camp in New York, and subsequently was named to the USA National Development Sled Hockey team. In addition to Sled Hockey Kyle played wheelchair basketball for TIRR Houston Hotwheels from 2010-2013, and won the 2013 NWBA Junior National Championship. He currently plays wheelchair basketball for the University of Texas Arlington where he is majoring in journalism. STARskaters is proud to have had a small part in Kyle's success but the real credit goes to Kyle's family for their support, dedication and countless hours on the road shuttling Kyle to his many sports activities. And, of course, Kyle himself for the hard work and dedication that took him from sitting on the floor of a roller hockey league in Beaumont to competing at the highest level of the sport against teams from all over the world. =USA Hockey Disabled Festival= STARskaters Sled Hockey team first competed in the USA Hockey Disabled festival April 13-15th, 2012. Players from Houston and Austin joined combined to win 3rd place in their first ever national competition. In 2013 players from Houston and Dallas combined to participate in the Disabled Festival as the Texas STARS in Philadelphia, PA but failed to earn a medal. In 2014 at the tournament in Boston, Mass, the team finished in second place. In 2015 the team went undefeated, outscoring their opponents 33‚Äì2 and won the championship of the national division.

Located around 12 km south to the Colombo city, near Dehiwala - Maharagama road, the temple attracts hundreds of devotees daily and is famous for its annual Esala Perehera festival which usually takes place in the month of August or September. One of the most venerated Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, many devotees flock to worship the sacred Bo tree of Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara, which is considered to be one of the first offshoots of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The present chief incumbent of Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara is Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera. History and revival There is literary evidence in ancient texts such as the Sinhala Bodhivamsaya which records that the Bodhi-tree in Bellanwila as one of the thirty two saplings that sprang from the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi at Anuradhapura planted in the 3rd century BC. Bellanwila is also mentioned in the literary works of the 15th century, when Kotte, which is located close to Bellanwila, became the capital of the country. In the Kotte period Buddhism rose to great heights with the royal patronage of King Parakramabahu VI (1412-1467), who was the last native sovereign to unify all of Sri Lanka under one rule before the European colonial invasions. The story of the revival of Bellanwila Viharaya is closely linked with Attidiya, a village adjoining Bellanwila. This sacred place was abandoned after the Portuguese invasion of the country‚Äôs coastal areas. It was rediscovered by an adventurous monk known as Thengodagedara Hamuduruwo, who is said to be the founder of Galauda Viharaya. One day in 1850, when he was traveling by boat along the Katu-ela stream towards Pepiliyana, it is said that he heard the sound of drums from a nearby thicket. Being inquisitive, he left the boat and walked towards the sounds. As he approached, the drum sounds faded away and he was surprised to see a Bodhi-tree. Subsequently, he came to discover that this was one of the thirty two saplings from the sacred Bodhi-tree at Anuradhapura. With the help of villagers, Thengodagedara thera cleared the land around the tree and built a modest shelter for monks. With this modest and mysterious beginning, Bellanwila began to attract the attention of Buddhist devotees in the neighborhood. Since Thengodagedara thera rediscovered Bellanwila, the temple has had a succession of chief monks such as Udugampola Sri Ratanapala thera, Udugampola Sri Dammakkhandha thera, Abhidhammika Weboda Sri Sangharatana thera, Asgiriye Devarakkhita thera and Bellanwila Sri Somaratana thera. It is Ven. Bellanwila Sri Somaratana thera, who became the chief incumbent of the temple in 1947 must be given the credit for raising Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara to its present status. He began the task of developing the temple and he himself designed the structural concept of the temple complex taking the image house of Polonnaruwa as the model. After the demise of Bellanwila Sri Somaratana thera, his pupil prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratne Thera has continued the development work of the temple. A recent addition to the temple is a set of murals, that adorn the inner walls of the shrine hall (Budu-Ge). These murals which were painted by artist Somabandu Vidyapathy, depict in different strokes the life of the Buddha and Buddhism. In addition to the main shrine hall there are shrines dedicated to popular deities of Sri Lanka such as Vishnu, Katharagama, Saman, Vibheeshana, Suniam, Dedimunda, Natha and Pattini Matha, housing their symbolic images. These shrines which are situated right round the Bodhi tree, also depicts the architecture of Polonnaruwa period. Esala festival The simple Bellanwila Esala perehera (procession) that was started in 1947 under the instructions of Bellanwila Somaratana Nayaka Thera has now grown into a famous colorful pageant, which attracts large crowds annually. Today it is one of the most famous annual cultural pageants in Sri Lanka. The Esala festival of Bellanwila, which is usually held throughout a week in the month of August or September in every year, draws many devotees from the district of Colombo and from other parts of the country. The attraction is not only for the colourful features of the procession itself, but more so for the religious activities that leads up to the main event. Bellanwila esala festival includes Dhamma Desana sessions (religious sermons) which draws many devotees to the temple. Invoking of blessings starts with a week long Pirith chanting, which is followed by the processions that parade in the neighborhood of Bellanwila during the nights of Esala festival. The Bellanewila Esala festival consist of a series of processions, namely Deva-dootha Perahera, Kumbal Perahera, Mal Perahera, Paawaada Perahera, Ransivili Perahera and Randoli Perahera. The Diya Kapeema Perahera and Deva Daanaya which concludes the esala festival, follows the Randoli Perahera which is held in the final night of the festival. The Bellanwila Esala procession usually consists of drummers, dancers (low-country and up-country), decorated tuskers and trumpeters who parades the neighbourhoods of the Bellanwila temple premises. Lantern bearers, together with devotees who carry Buddhist flags also take part in this grand display of religious piety, which portrays the Buddhist cultural and artistic heritage of Sri Lanka.

Al Heera is a suburb in Northern Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, traditionally home to the Darawishah, part of the Al Bu Shamis section of the Na'im tribe. At one stage declaring its independence from Sharjah, with its own Sheikh, it formally became part of the Emirate of Sharjah in 1949 on the death of its Ruler, Abdulrahman Al Shamsi. A coastal settlement with a small harbour formerly used by a number of fishermen and pleasure boat owners, its main distinguishing feature today is its police station, converted in 2019 into the 'Al Heera Literature Society' building. The original coastal fishing village, built mainly of traditional Emirati adobe and coral houses, sat along the corniche in the area immediately behind the Al Heera Police Station but fell into disuse and was home to taxi drivers and illegal labourers through the 1990s until it was cleared. Little remains today to mark where the original settlement existed. History Al Heera is first mentioned in British records of 1830: \\"The people of Heera, a Joasmee dependency, commit a piracy upon a Bundar Abbas boat. Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur of his own accord compels full restitution of the property and punishes the perpetrators.\\" Almost a century later, the head of the Al Bu Shamis, Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi, briefly deposed Humaid bin Abdulaziz Al Nuaimi, the ruler of neighbouring emirate Ajman, on 15 June 1920. He was convinced to leave the fort in Ajman, which he had invested, by the British Residency Agent in Sharjah. At the time Al Heera was quite a large coastal pearling village of about 250 houses. Opposed by the Rulers of Ajman and Sharjah, Abdulrahman was promised safe passage by the British Residency Agent as he owed money to a number of British subjects but was prevented from returning to Al Heera by the vengeful Sheikh of Ajman. After spending time in Ru'us Al Jibal (in Oman) and Al Khan (Southern Sharjah), Abdulrahman was allowed to return to Al Heera by the ruler of Sharjah in 1921 in a settlement at least partly enforced by the presence of the British ship HMS Triad under Captain John Pearson. The son of the former Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, was a minor when his uncle, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi, took power in 1914. Sultan subsequently, on reaching his majority, petitioned Ahmad for the restitution of property and money that Khalid had seized on assuming power, but in vain. Embittered, Sultan left Sharjah in 1921 and settled in Dubai. In 1923, he married the daughter of Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi of Al Heera. Khaled bin Ahmad took this as a challenge and once again moved against Al Heera, but Abdulrahman appealed to the British Residency Agent who negotiated a peace and put two of his own men to guard the fort at Al Heera. Khalid then appointed a Wali over Al Heera who Abdulrahman then arrested. Khalid then moved once again against Al Heera, which Abdulrahman now prepared to defend against a combined force from Sharjah and Ajman. Another British intervention followed and Abdulrahman went to Dubai to join his son-in-law. By now, the people of Sharjah had had enough and called on Sultan to rule them. On 1 November 1924, Sultan bin Saqr, backed by a force raised by Abdulrahman, was welcomed into Sharjah and deposed Khalid in a brief, 11-day conflict. Abdulrahman's son-in- law was now Ruler of Sharjah and would come to depend on him almost completely. Abdulrahman was suspected of an attempt on the life of the British Residency Agent in October 1925, causing a major clash between the British government and the Rulers of the Trucial States, specifically Ras Al Khaimah, whose ruler refused to give Abdulrahman up to the British in 1926, but eventually complied. Abdulrahman was sent onto Bombay and then to a four-year exile in Yemen, although he returned after three years with Sultan guaranteeing his good behaviour to the British.Persian Gulf Residency - Summary of News from the Arab States, August 1926, Francis Belville Prideaux - IOR/L/PS/10/1177 Abdulrahman ruled Al Heera until his death in 1949, when the township reverted to rule by Sharjah.  Trucial Oman Scouts  Al Heera was the site of the Mirgab Military Base, the core base of operations for the Trucial Oman Scouts, the paramilitary force established by the British government to ensure internal security and stability in the Trucial States. Consisting of a Medical Centre, Mechanical Transport Squadron, Signals Squadron and Quartermaster, the base was serviced by a dhobi and coffee shop owned and operated by an Iranian, Esa bin Mousa Al Amri, as well as a camp shop owned by a Mr Lalchand and managed by a Sikh gentleman by the name of Hari Singh Bhatia. The base is used today by the Sharjah Police Special Tasks Section.  Poetry  Al Heera was something of a centre for the development of the UAE's strong tradition of Nabati poetry. Among the first Classical Arabic UAE poets to gain importance in this part of the world during the twentieth century were Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880‚Äì1954), Salem bin Ali Al Owais (1887‚Äì1959) and Ahmed bin Sulayem (1905‚Äì1976). Al Owais was born in Al Heera. Three other prominent Nabati poets in the UAE were Khalfan Musabah (1923‚Äì1946), Sheikh Saqr Al Qasimi (1925‚Äì1993), a former ruler of Sharjah, and Sultan bin Ali Al Owais (1925‚Äì2000). The three poets, known as the Heera Group, grew up in Al Heera and were close friends.

Also discovered in the vicinity are remnants of a residence from the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234). The museum opened in 1983 and has been closed since 2012 for renovation and expansion. History Liu Jian was the Prince of Guangyang who ruled the Guangyang State, a royal fiefdom that administered four counties in the Beijing region during the Western Han dynasty. His father Liu Dan, also a prince, was stripped of his royal title for conspiring against the Han Emperor Zhao and the State of Guangyang was demoted to a prefecture.(Chinese) Zhou Zhengyi (Âë®Ê≠£‰πâ), Â§ßËëÜÂè∞Ë•øÊ±âÂ¢ìÂèäÂàòÂª∫ÂÖ∂‰∫∫ Beijing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage 2008-10-15 During the reign of Han Emperor Xuan, the family's royal status was restored and Liu Jian became prince.

Liu Jian's tomb was discovered in 1974 by workers of the East is Red Petrochemical Refinery who were digging inside two mounds of earth in Dabaotai village to bury storage tanks. They discovered charcoal, plaster and ancient coins. Chinese archaeologists called to inspect the site discovered Tomb No. 1. The tomb had been looted and burned in antiquity. Charred bone remnants indicates that the entombed was a male of about 45‚Äì55 years old. Archaeologists identified the tomb as belonging to Liu Jian using artifacts and historical records. Based on the scale of the tomb, they determined that the buried was a royal prince. Inscription on a piece of lacquerware found inside the tomb indicates that the ware was made in the 24th year of the reign of the owner. According to historical records, only four princes in the Han dynasty ruled the Beijing region for as long as 24 years. Based on coins found in the tomb that date to 118 BC, two of the princes who died prior to that date were eliminated. The tomb of a third prince, Liu Dan who was Liu Jian's father had already been found in Shijingshan District, leaving Liu Jian as the only possible resident prince of the tomb.(Chinese) ‰æØÊôìÊô®, Â§ßËëÜÂè∞Ë•øÊ±âÂ¢ìÂçöÁâ©È¶Ü Áõ¥Èù¢Á•ûÁßòÂè§Â¢ì Âåó‰∫¨ÈùíÂπ¥Êä• 2009-11-27 In 1975, Tomb No. 2, belonging to Liu Jian's wife, was excavated.

Tombs The two tombs are located apart and both shaped in the character Âá∏. Both face the south and are deep. The Prince's tomb measures from north to south and from east to west. His wife's tomb is slightly smaller, measuring from north to south and meters from east to west. The interior space of the Prince's tomb at is larger than that of the Qianlong Emperor's tomb, which is only . Inside each tomb is an antechamber, burial chamber, storeroom and connecting passageways. The tomb's ceiling and floor are lined with charcoal and plaster. The plaster acts as a seal against outside air. The charcoal absorbs moisture inside the tomb. The tomb is surrounded by several layers of earthen and wooden walls. Wall of yellow cypress wood The most distinctive feature of the Dabaotai tombs is a wall of evenly cut yellow cypress wood piled high that separate the tomb's outer and inner hallways. Each piece of wood is . The entire wall in the Prince's tomb is long. Various records from antiquity have documented the cypress wall as a feature of royal Han tombs and those of nobles who were bestowed with the honor. The imperial tombs of the Western Han emperors had all been looted and destroyed in antiquity, so archaeologists had not seen such a wall until the Dabaotai excavation. Since the 1970s, the tombs of Han princes in Hebei, Hunan and Jiangsu have also been found with cypress walls intact. In the south cypress wall is a door of about high and wide. A gilded bronze door knocker, , is made in the shape of a beast head. The beast head was used to ward off evil spirits. Bronzeware, which was quite common in Qin and Western Han dynasty tombs was almost completely replaced by ironware by the Eastern Han dynasty. Dabaotai represents this transition period. An iron axe found inside the tomb was stamped with the character Ê∏î for Yuyang, the name of the county near Guangyang where the item was made. Inside the tomb, the chambers are well preserved. In Liu Jian's tomb, the antechamber replicates the master's sitting room. To the north is the burial chamber, which contains a five-layered casket made from the yellow catalpa tree. Yellow catalpa, also called Chinese catalpa, was a rare wood that appears only in imperial tombs of the Western Han dynasty. Scrap pieces of jade and a jade pillow in the burial chamber suggests that the body had been clothed in a jade suit. Though the tomb was looted, some 400 pieces of bronze, jade, agate, silk, lacquer, and pottery artifacts have been recovered along with household wares. Several clay pots in the hallways stored rice and chestnuts. Others stored pork, chicken, pheasant, rabbit, swan goose and carp. Bones of a cat, collared crow, goats and oxen were also found. Buried in an hallway outside the cypress wall are remnants of three horses and one leopard. In all, the tombs have 11 horses and three chariots. One of the chariots, painted black and red, is adorned with gold- plated hardware. Scattered throughout the outer parts of the tomb are terra cotta clay figurines of maid servants. Eight ivory pieces from a liubo game set were found in the antechamber and inner hallway.(Chinese) ÈÉ≠‰∫¨ÂÆÅ, \\"Âåó‰∫¨ÊúÄÊó©Ë±°Ê£ãÂá∫Áé∞Âú®Èáë‰ª£ ÊÖàÁ¶ß‰πüÁà±‰∏ãÊ£ã\\" Âåó‰∫¨ÈùíÂπ¥Êä• 2013-12-10 Four of the pieces have a carved flying dragon on the oblique side.

Jin dynasty artifacts A Jin dynasty courtyard home stood in the vicinity of the two tombs and yielded over 1,000 artifacts including porcelain, pottery, ironware and coins. The brick well between the two tombs is among the best preserved Jin-era wells in Beijing. The well's opening rises from the Jin-era ground level, and has a diameter of and depth of .

The Stellar protocol is supported by a 501(c)3 nonprofit, the Stellar Development Foundation.  History  In 2014, Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Before the official launch, McCaleb formed a website called \\"Secret Bitcoin Project\\" seeking alpha testers. The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison and the project officially launched that July. Stellar received $3 million in seed funding from Stripe. Stellar was released as a decentralized payment network and protocol with a native currency, stellar. At its launch, the network had 100 billion stellars. 25 percent of those would be given to other non-profits working toward financial inclusion. Stripe received 2 percent or 2 billion of the initial stellars in return for its seed investment. The cryptocurrency, originally known as stellar, was later called Lumens or XLM. In August 2014, Mercado Bitcoin, the first Brazilian bitcoin exchange, announced it would be using the Stellar network. By January 2015, Stellar had approximately 3 million registered user accounts on its platform and its market cap was almost $15 million. The Stellar Development Foundation released an upgraded protocol with a new consensus algorithm in April 2015 which went live in November 2015. The new algorithm used SCP, a cryptocurrency protocol created by Stanford professor David Mazi√®res. Lightyear.io, a for- profit entity of Stellar, launched in May 2017 as the commercial arm of the company. In September 2017, Stellar announced a benefits program, part of its Stellar Partnership Grant Program, which would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development. In September 2018, Lightyear Corporation acquired Chain, Inc and the combined company was named Interstellar. = Real-world applications = In 2015, it was announced that Stellar was releasing an integration into Vumi, the open-sourced messaging platform of the Praekelt Foundation. Vumi uses cellphone talk time as currency using the Stellar protocol. Stellar partnered with cloud-based banking software company Oradian in April 2015 to integrate Stellar into Oradian's banking platform to add microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Nigeria. Deloitte announced its integration with Stellar in 2016 to build a cross-border payments application, Deloitte Digital Bank. In December 2016, it was announced that Stellar's payment network had expanded to include Coins.ph, a mobile payments startup in the Philippines, ICICI Bank in India, African mobile payments firm Flutterwave, and French remittances company Tempo Money Transfer. In October 2017, Stellar partnered with IBM and KlickEx to facilitate cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region. The cross- border payment system developed by IBM includes partnerships with banks in the area. In December 2017, TechCrunch announced Stellar's partnership with SureRemit, a Nigerian-based non-cash remittances platform.  Overview  Stellar is an open-source protocol for exchanging money or tokens using the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The platform's source code is hosted on GitHub. Servers run a software implementation of the protocol, and use the Internet to connect to and communicate with other Stellar servers. Each server stores a ledger of all the accounts in the network. 3 nodes are operated by the Stellar Development Foundation, in conjunction with 21 other organizations, providing for a total of 66 validator nodes. Transactions among accounts occur not through mining but rather through a consensus process among accounts in quorum slice.

Married, with three children, and six grandchildren. Work Academician Abdullayev dedicated over fifty years of his life to the physics of semiconductors. Discovered new groups of binary and ternary compounds of selenium and tellurium, suggested diodes with controlled electronic memory, created complex semiconductors used as receivers for visible and infrared spectrum areas. By researching the physics of selenium and selenium appliances, was the first to explain the abnormalities in selenium and invented an approach to control them. Carried out a set of research projects to receive semiconductor monocrystals of complex chemical composition for lasers and memory modules. Elaborated new semiconductor materials for heat converters. In 1954, Hasan Abdullayev founded the Department of Semiconductor Physics at the Baku State University (BSU). Abdullayev founded the Nakhchivan and Gyandja branches of the Azerbaijan SSR Academy of Sciences and established more than 50 scientific production and construction bureaus, which were tasked with the application of scientific theories and discoveries, and their more rapid introduction into production and life, in the republic. According to a 2010 article published in the Russian scientific journal Physics and technique of semiconductors of the Joffe Institute, dedicated to the 60th anniversary of semiconductor electronics research in the USSR, one of the important roles in Soviet semiconductor electronics research, development and innovation was done by academician Abdullayev. Academician Abdullayev's lifelong research and work concentrated on chemical elements selenium and tellurium, their applications in semiconductors, biophysics and nuclear sciences. Zhores Alferov, the Nobel- prize winning physicist, praised the work and legacy of his late colleague and friend, academician Abdullayev, recognizing how hard it was for Azerbaijani scientists to rise even within USSR, much less in the world, and only a few people as Abdullayev managed to do it, creating new industries and directions in physics and other sciences. At the initiative and under the direct leadership of academician Hasan Abdullayev the following research and scientific institutions and initiatives were established: * 1947 ‚Äì Citywide (later Republican) seminars on physics in Baku * 1954 ‚Äì Department of Semiconductor Physics established at the Baku State University * 1957-1959 ‚Äì Institute of Physics and Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics * 1959 ‚Äì Shemakha Astrophysical Observatory, based on the astrophysics Sector * 1965 ‚Äì Institute of Cybernetics established * 1967 ‚Äì Batabat Astrophysical Sector (now Observatory) in Nakhchivan region * 1969 ‚Äì Radiation Research Sector, later the Institute of Radiation Problems, on the basis of which the National Centre for Nuclear Research has been created in 2014 * 1970 ‚Äì Scientific- production associations ¬´Ulduz¬ª, ¬´Nord¬ª, ¬´Azon¬ª, ¬´Iskra¬ª, ¬´Tellur¬ª, ¬´Billur¬ª (1968) * 1972 ‚Äì Nakhchivan Research Center, which is now the Nakhchivan Department of ANAS (National Academy of the Republic of Azerbaijan) * 1972 ‚Äì Sector of Microbiology (now Institute); Experimental-production works at the Institute of Petrochemical Processes * 1973 ‚Äì The branch of the Institute of Applied Physics, which is now the Institute of Photo-electronics; * 1973‚ÄîSheki Zonal Scientific Base, which became the Sheki Regional Research Center * 1974 ‚Äì Department of Astrophysics at the Baku State University; * 1974 -- \\"Caspian\\" Research Center at the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, since 1992 ‚Äì Azerbaijan Space Agency * 1975 ‚Äì two Laboratories of High Energy Physics at the Institute of Physics.

Scientific efforts and peer recognition Academician Hasan Abdullayev is the author of 28 monographs, several scientific textbooks, approximately six hundred scientific journal articles. He holds 585 patents from USSR (including 171 secret and 65 top secret patents for technologies with military applications), and 35 foreign patents from France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Sweden, Italy, Bulgaria, India, and U.S. (United States Patent 3,472,652). Academician Abdullayev received highest praise from his colleagues, including Nobel Prize winner academician Zhores Alferov, Nobel Prize winner academician Alexander Prokhorov, Kurchatov Institute President and Director Evgeny Velikhov, academician Bentsion Vul, academician Vladimir Tuchkevich, academician Sergey Kapitsa, academician Roald Sagdeev, Nobel Prize winner professor Rudolf Ludwig Mossbauer, academician Nikolay Bogolyubov, Soviet Academy of Sciences Presidents academician Alexander Nesmeyanov, academician Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov, academician Mstislav Keldysh and other Soviet and foreign scientists. According to a 2008 article, \\"Academician Abdullayev was called the Father of Physics in Azerbaijan and one of the Founders of the School of Semiconductor Research in the Soviet Union by such authoritative scientists as academicians Zh.Alferov, Yu.Gulyaev, L.Kurbatov, V.Isakov, Professor D.Nasledov, and others. In fact, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the most authoritative Soviet encyclopedia - the Soviet equivalent of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in the West, listed the names of scientists, making the greatest contributions to the development of semiconductor electronics and microelectronics in this order: A.F.Ioffe (who was Abdullayev's mentor during his postdoctoral studies in Leningrad), N.P.Sazhin, Ya.I.Frenkel, B.M.Vul, V.M.Tuchkevich, H.B.Abdullayev, Zh.I.Alferov, L.V.Keldish, and others (Third Edition, 1970, page 351). Thus, already in 1970, this encyclopedia put academician Abdullayev as the sixth most influential scientist in semi- conductor research, higher than such giants as Academicians Alferov and Keldish!\\" Academician Abdullayev was recognized as the top expert on the chemical element selenium, and thus entrusted authoring the article on selenium in the third (final) edition of the top scientific reference publication - the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

He is best known for his opposition to the Chico River Dam Project, which led to his assassination by armed forces under the command of then-President Ferdinand Marcos. Because his murder was a watershed moment which united the peoples of the Cordillera in opposition against the dam, Macli-ing Dulag is among the most well known of the many victims of Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, and his name in inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani's Wall of Remembrance memorial in Quezon City.  Early life and family  There are no records documenting Macli-ing Dulag's date of birth, but he was born in the highland village of Bugnay, Tinglayan, Kalinga-Apayao, and the accounts of his contemporaries in Bugnay indicate that he was in his early twenties during World War II, when he served as a porter to guerilla forces fighting against the Japanese forces. As was usual among the Butbut people at the time, he did not receive any formal schooling, although he learned how to sign his name.  Early leadership roles Like the majority of Kalinga people of the time, Macli-ing earned his living through farming, although at one point briefly took on a job as a \\"caminero\\" (road maintenance worker) for the Department of Public Works and Highways. By the 1960s, he had become a respected pangat (leader) among the Butbut people, who lived in the villages of Bugnay, Buscalan, Lokong, Ngibat and Butbut in the Municipality of Tinglayan, Kalinga. He was elected to three terms as Barrio Captain of Bugnay. One contemporary noted: \\"No adda riribuk dagiti agkakailian dagdagusenna't tumulong nga mangibanag kadagitoy. (He did not hesitate to lose a day's work to settle disputes among his people.)\\"  Opposition to the Chico River Dam Project  = Early opposition= In 1974, residents of Sadanga, Mountain Province and Tinglayan, Kalinga were surprised when teams from the National Power Corporation began appearing in their villages, conducting preparatory surveys for the Chico River Dam Project of then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos. They had not been consulted when a technical feasibility study for the project had been completed a year before, in 1973. The communities, composed of indigenous Kalinga and Bontoc people, objected to the project when they learned that the project called for the construction of four hydroelectric dams along the Chico River, with the priority being the construction of the Chico II dam in Sadanga, and the Chico IV dam in Tinglayan. The UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples later estimated that 300,000 people would have been affected by the project. As a pangat of the Butbut, Macli-ing was one of the first leaders to oppose the project, organizing a bodong (peace council) in Barrio Tanglag in 1974 as an attempt to rally opposition against the dam. In May 1975, the Episcopal Commission on Tribal Filipinos of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines helped organize another bodong involving 150 Bontoc and Kalinga leaders alongside church-based support groups, at St. Bridget's School in Quezon City. The Quezon City bodong resulted in an agreement (Pagta ti Bodong) which united the Bontoc and Kalinga people in opposition against the dam and the Marcos Administration. These early opposition efforts forced the Marcos administration to temporarily pull the NAPOCOR survey teams out of the area in 1975. = Militarization of Chico IV areas = Frustrated by the project delays caused by the opposition, Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree no. 848 on December 1975, constituting the municipalities of Lubuagan, Tinglayan, Tanudan, and Pasil into a \\"Kalinga Special Development Region\\" (KSDR), in an effort to neutralize opposition to the Chico IV dam. Marcos had placed the entirety of the Philippines under Martial Law in 1972, so the areas affected by the dam project were easily militarized. Aside from the provincial constabulary forces, paramilitary units (the infamously violent Civilian Home Defense Forces) were activated in communities opposed to the dam. By 1976, the 60th Philippine Constabulary (PC) Brigade had been brought into the Chico IV area to suppress opposition to the dam project. Empowered by Martial Law to conduct warrantless arrests, the 60th PC Brigade had arrested at least 150 locals by April 1977, accusing them of supposed subversion and of obstructing government projects, and various other offenses such as boycotting the October 1976 Constitutional Referendum. Individuals arrested included tribal papangat (leaders/elders), young couples, and in at least one case, a 12-year old child. Macli-ing was one of 16 Bugnay villagers incarcerated for two months by the PC that year. Pressure from groups such as Amnesty International finally forced the PC to release these prisoners - some of whom had been incarcerated for 8 months - in June 1977. By December 1978, parts of the Chico IV area had been declared \\"free fire zones\\", no-man's-land areas where the army could freely fire on any animals or permit-less humans at will. The 51st Philippine Constabulary Brigade was brought in from the conflict area in Sulu, to replace the 60th. Macli-ing and the other opposition leaders were undaunted, and more bodong pacts ceremonies were organized - including two of the largest bodong councils ever, in June 1978, and December 1979. The December 1979 bodong was attended by 2,000 Kalingas and Bontocs and saw Macli-ing officially designated as the official spokesperson for the opposition effort. Furthering the militarization of Tomiangan, the Philippine Constabulary forces were replaced by the 44th Army Infantry Brigade, which had previously been assigned to Isabela. = Bribery attempts = Even as the armed forces were focused harassing the Bontoc and Kalinga into relinquishing their lands, government officials also attempted to get the locals to leave by bribing tribal leaders, achieving only a little success. Since Macli-ing was a prominent figure within the opposition, many of the Marcos administrations' efforts at bribing the opposition focused on him. He was offered a plush job as coordinator of the KSDR, which would have given him a large monthly salary, but he rejected the offer. In another instance, he was invited to a meeting at the Panamin Foundation headquarters; upon arriving he was shocked when he was led to a room full of \\"young and beautiful women,\\" and told to \\"choose one for the night.\\" He refused and asked to be allowed to leave. The best known of these bribery attempts describes a meeting between Macli-ing and Manuel Elizalde Jr., the Presidential Assistant on National Minorities. According to the account documented by Doyo, Elizalde handed Macli-ing an envelope, but Macli- ing refused to accept it, saying: > \\"There can be one of two things in an envelope: letter or money. Since I am > illiterate, this is hardly a letter. As for money, it is only given to > someone who has something to sell. I have nothing to sell.\\"  Murder  Macli-ing Dulag was assassinated by Marcos-controlled military forces on 24 April 1980. Eyewitness accounts indicate that ten individuals in military uniforms arrived in Bugnay on two Ford Fiera trucks, seeking out Macli-ing Dulag and Pedro Dungoc, another opposition leader who lived nearby. The military personnel told Macli-ing to come out, but he refused, telling them to return the following day. He asked his wife to hold the door closed while he secured its lock, and lit a lamp to do so. The light of the lamp allowed the assailants to see where their target was behind the door, and they immediately fired on Macli-ing through a slit under the door, killing him instantly. The sustained a total of ten bullet wounds, with the fatal ones being on the left breast and the right pelvis. At least 13 Bullet holes were later found on the door and walls of Macli-ing Dulag's residence, and shell casings from a Browning Automatic Rifle and an M-16 rifle were found. Another unit targeted Dungoc, but accidentally fired on the wrong target, so Dungoc escaped with only minor injuries.  Aftermath  = Trial of Macli-ing Dulag's murderers = His attackers were eventually identified as men under the command of Lieutenant Leodegario Adalem of the 44th Infantry Battalion, a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy's class of 1978. (Adalem and his men were identified more broadly in most media reports as elements of the \\"4th Infantry Division\\"). Under pressure from the international community to solve Macli-ing's murder, the Ministry of National Defense informed Amnesty International in 1981 that it had recommended the filing of cases against Adalem, two sergeants, and two draftees, the \\"reversion to inactive duty\\" of another (unspecified) officer and three of his men, and the administrative reprimand of the commander of the 44th Infantry Battalion, although Amnesty International was unable to ascertain whether these recommendations had been acted upon. Adalem and some of his men were later brought before a court Martial at Martinez Hall in Camp Henry T. Allen in Baguio City. Later, however, Adalem was restored to active duty and was eventually able to retire with the rank of Major in the Philippine Army. He was killed in an ambush in April 2000. = Impact on Martial Law press coverage = Coverage of Macli- ing's murder proved to be a watershed moment in the mainstream press' coverage of Martial Law. The story of Macli-ing's murder was most actively pursued by journalist Ma Ceres P. Doyo and playwright Rene O. Villanueva, who got the story out in the press, and were interrogated by the military as a result. Editor Leonor Aureus, writing in 1985 for the National Press Club, noted that in the decade since 1972, there had been \\"no open and serious confrontation between the [mainstream] press and the military following the wave of arrests after martial law was declared.\\" = Abandonment of the dam project = Macli- ing Dulag's murder unified the various peoples of the Cordillera Mountains against the proposed dam, causing both the World Bank and the Marcos regime to eventually abandon the project a few years after. Legacy Dulag's name is inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of the Heroes) Wall of Remembrance in Quezon City, Metro Manila, which is dedicated to victims of extrajudicial killings since the Martial Law era. April 24, the date of Dulag's murder, is one of two days observed annually as \\"Cordillera Day\\" in the Cordillera Administrative Region.  In art and popular media  The Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) portrayed the life of Macli- ing Dulag and the horrors of martial law in the 1988 play Macli-ing Dulag. It was written by Malou Leviste Jacob and directed by Soxy Topacio. It starred Nanding Josef in the title role. Writer-director Dennis N. Marasigan lists it as one of 14 essential plays on martial law in the Philippines. \\"Dumaloy ang Ilog Chico (And so the Chico River Flows)\\" is a 1995 children's book narrating the campaign to defend the Kalinga community against soldiers and foreign contractors. It was written by Judy Cari√±o and Rene Villanueva and illustrated by Bernie Solina. It was one of the stories about Dulag recited at the Philippine Daily Inquirer‚Äôs Read-Along session in Surigao del Sur in 2015. The story of Macli-ing Dulag's opposition to the Chico River Dam Project features prominently as a plot point in Auraeus Solito's 2008 film \\"Pisay,\\" which is set in the Philippine Science High School in Quezon City during the months leading up to the 1986 EDSA Revolution and the 1997 documentary Batas Miitar. \\"Ang Pangat, ang Lupang Ninuno at ang Ilog (The Chieftain, the Ancestral Land and the River),‚Äù written by Luz Maranan, is a story about the chieftain Dulag who led Igorot tribes against the government‚Äôs dam project during the Marcos regime. The story won third prize in the 2012 Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature. The University of the Philippines Press published in 2015 Macli-ing Dulag: Kalinga Chief, Defender of the Cordillera, written by journalist Ma. Ceres P. Doyo. The essay on which the book was based led to the author's harassment by the Philippine military in 1980. The original essay won a Catholic Mass Media Award for journalism, handed by Pope John Paul II to Doyo in February 1981.

She served as the original Executive Director for the Transgender Gender Variant Intersex Justice Project, which aims to assist transgender persons, who are disproportionately incarcerated under the prison-industrial complex. Griffin-Gracy has participated in activism for a wide range of causes throughout her lifetime, including the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City. Early life Griffin- Gracy was born in the South Side of Chicago on October 25, 1940, and was assigned male at birth. Griffin-Gracy participated in drag balls during her youth, and described her experience in Chicago in a 1998 interview: Griffin- Gracy also believed that, at the time, she and her peers were unaware they were questioning the gender they were assigned at birth, and noted that much of the contemporary terminology surrounding gender identities did not exist. Miss Major reported that she came out as a teenager in the late 1950s. As a teenager, Griffin-Gracy was met with a lot of criticism and maltreatment from her peers. In a radio interview, she recalls the need for someone to always be by her side in order to avoid situations where her peers could single her out and violently attack her.  Transitioning  During her period of transitioning, Griffin-Gracy relied on the black market for her hormones. Over twenty years, she suffered from homelessness and participated in sex work. She also participated in other illegal activities, including theft, in order to support herself.  Family  Griffin-Gracy has four sons. Christopher was born in 1978. Her three other sons were adopted into her family after meeting them in a California park. The boys were runaways, and had meals together with Griffin-Gracy and her biological son. In September 2020, Griffin-Gracy announced that she and her partner, LGBTQ+ activist Beck Witt, were expecting a child together. Activism work =New York City= After having been kicked out of two colleges for the outward expression of her identity, Griffin-Gracy moved from Chicago to New York City. While some organizations, including gay bars in the city, would deny entry to trans women, she established herself within an LGBT community associated with the Stonewall Inn, a bar in Greenwich Village. She recounted, \\"We could go to Stonewall and everything would be fine, we didn't have to explain ourselves.\\" On June 27, 1969, Griffin-Gracy was in the Stonewall Inn meeting with a girlfriend when the bar was raided, an action which initiated the Stonewall riots. Griffin- Gracy was a leader in the riots, but was struck on her head by a police officer and was taken into custody. While in prison, she reported that a corrections officer broke her jaw. She had a five-year sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora for a burglary conviction where she met Frank \\"Big Black\\" Smith who had participated in the Attica Correctional Facility riots of 1971. The two of them communicated regularly during her time there, him showing her great respect despite her gender identity. Smith talked Griffin-Gracy through the information that she needed to really help her community‚Äîto fix a problem rather than mask it. She was released from Dannemora in 1974 with new hope for her community. =California= Griffin- Gracy moved to San Diego in 1978 and organized community efforts and grassroots movements. She initially started with work at a local food bank and later provided direct services for trans women who were incarcerated, suffering from addiction, or homeless. While in San Diego, the AIDS epidemic struck the United States, and as a part of her service, Griffin-Gracy found herself providing additional healthcare and multiple funerals each week. Griffin-Gracy then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid 1990s where she served on multiple HIV/AIDS organizations including the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center. In 2003, Griffin-Gracy began working at the Transgender Gender Variant Intersex Justice Project (TGIJP) shortly after it was founded by Alex Lee, although sometimes she is credited as the founder. She served as the Executive Director of the project, leading efforts to support transgender women who have been imprisoned, particularly women of color. Both within her organization and without, she has fought against criminalization and police brutality. She is credited for leading direct service efforts and personalized care to incarcerated trans women of color with TGIJP in addition to her leadership in previous organizations. =General views= Griffin-Gracy views the state of being transgender or genderqueer as one of \\"living outside the law\\" due to constant rejection from mainstream audiences, particularly in pursuing job or education opportunities. She also argues that while many people with transgender and queer identities are not imprisoned, their identities and means of expression are policed through social behavior and state policies. She frequently cites the prison industrial complex as a major factor in why transgender people are incarcerated, specifically people of color and those with low income. Griffin-Gracy has discussed the need for activism for transgender persons based in part on stories of discrimination from others. She herself began her journey as a trans activist after being made aware of how many young trans women were being murdered with no response from the world around them. In the 1970s, a friend named Puppy, a Puerto Rican trans woman and sex worker, was found dead in her own apartment. Griffin-Gracy held that there was evidence of a murder, but authorities ruled her death a suicide. Griffin-Gracy described the event and its impact on her in an interview: This outlook has fueled much of her activism to date. Griffin-Gracy has frequently criticized the LGBT movement based on its exclusion of transgender persons from participation and positions of leadership, particularly trans people of color, those with low income, and those who have been previously imprisoned. = Feminism = Griffin-Gracy is a self- proclaimed feminist. Her view of feminism is a woman's ability to be both strong and sensitive, and to do so proudly. She made the decision to identify as a feminist when people began questioning her as a parent. She focuses her activism on the safety of young trans women today, a liberal feminist approach. She has noted that her favorite aspect of activist work is the education and hope that it provides to the women in her community. She wishes for the simplest human rights for trans youth, saying: > I'd like for the girls to get a chance to be who they are. For young > transgender people to go to school, learn like everyone else does, and then > get out there and live their lives, not afraid or thinking that the only > solution for them is death. In addition to her focus on basic human rights, Miss Major advocates for radical change in her community. She strives to bring attention to the intersectionality of poverty, race, and gender in situations related to incarceration, employment, and mental and physical health. She draws inspiration for her activism from Elizabeth Taylor and Angela Davis. Documentary A documentary titled Major! was released in 2015 and portrays Griffin-Gracy's role as an activist and mentor in the transgender community since the 1960s. She describes the film as not only a tool to present to young trans women their history, but as a reminder for herself that young women still need her help.

Anti-trafficking laws and policies  The United States Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act in 2000, which not only criminalizes human trafficking but aims to support its victims. In 2002, the Florida Department of Children and Families Office of Refugee Resettlement began a project to explore how Florida could implement this new law. = Statewide Council on Human Trafficking = The Florida Legislature started the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking, which will spend two years developing policy recommendations for curbing human trafficking by prosecuting offenders and providing services to victims. The council includes fifteen members, including prosecutors, legislators, health experts, social services experts, and the Attorney General Pam Bondi as Chair. The council will work toward creating recommendations for certifying safe homes for victims of human trafficking and for prosecuting traffickers who participate in the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons through coercion.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 October 2013. The character was introduced as an acquaintance of builder Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), who he soon goes into business with as part of a revenge plot. Phelan blackmails both Owen and Gary Windass (Mikey North) into working for him for free, after Gary attacks him for making sexual advances towards his mother and Owen's girlfriend, Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). The character's first stint culminates in Phelan coercing Anna to have sex with him in exchange for relinquishing his torment of Gary and Owen. He departed on 14 April 2014. The character was reintroduced on 19 January 2016. Producers established a romantic relationship between Phelan and Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver), whom he later marries. He also commits a series of crimes, which include creating a fraudulent property scheme, causing the death of Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), kidnapping Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) and Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey), framing Anna for pushing Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) off a ladder, and murdering Andy and later also Luke Britton (Dean Fagan). Phelan's long-lost daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) was introduced in 2017, a development that continues exploration of the character's background. Phelan's crimes are exposed in March 2018 and during a confrontation with Eileen, he falls into the sea and is presumed dead. Phelan returns as part of a series of special post-watershed episodes. He attempts to flee Weatherfield with his grandson Zack on the day of Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) and Michelle Connor's (Kym Marsh) wedding. Phelan shoots both Nicola and Michelle, before he is stabbed to death by Anna. During the character's second stint, he was named one of the best soap villains of all time and in the programme itself; alongside the likes of Alan Bradley (Mark Eden) and Richard Hillman (Brian Capron). Storylines =2013‚Äì2014= Pat Phelan first appeared as a client of Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), the property landlord of Weatherfield ‚Äî a fictional district in Greater Manchester. When Owen visits Phelan at his house for a ¬£4,000 repayment over a job he previously did for him, he instead learns that Phelan is apparently bankrupt and that all his assets are bequeathed to his wife Valerie (Caroline Berry) ‚Äî who too refuses to pay Owen when he confronts her at her salon shop about Phelan's debt. A frustrated Owen and his protege Gary Windass (Mikey North) later break into Phelan's house, steal his motorbike, and lock it away at the builder's yard. Phelan confronts Owen at the yard and threatens to call the police for stealing his bike, but is forced to relent when Owen promises to tell Valerie about his recent infidelity ‚Äî making it clear of how much he knows all about Phelan's \\"shady\\" past. Left with no other choice, Phelan pays Owen the ¬£4,000 he owes him and is given back his motorbike. Two months later before Christmas 2013, Phelan visits Owen at his house with a business proposition; to put forward a flat- conversion contract, with Owen acting as the project's front since Phelan is bankrupt. Despite family reservations, Owen becomes interested in the offer and meets up with Phelan in early 2014 to discuss their potential partnership. Phelan tells Owen that he needs ¬£80,000 stumping up for the costs, but guarantees that he would make over ¬£200,000 profit and gives him 24 hours to discuss the deal with his partner: Gary's mother Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) ‚Äî who herself opposes the idea due to her suspicions that Phelan is a conman. However, their business partnership is nevertheless agreed on after Owen's young daughter Katy (Georgia May Foote) urges him to go ahead with Phelan's project. Tensions initially rise when Owen finds out that Phelan has not put his ¬£120,000 investment into the account and, after failing to contact him over the situation, suspects that he might have conned them. Phelan soon appears at the builder's yard and claims that the money is already in the account, requesting that Owen phone the bank to confirm his story; Owen makes the call and, much to his embarrassment, learns that Phelan's share has indeed been transferred onto the account ‚Äî with the bank admitting to an online error that delayed the money transfer on the previous day. Anna later visits Phelan at his house to apologize for her reservations, but is left stunned when he contemplates on her attractiveness; she becomes uneasy in his presence and leaves. Anna begins to grow increasingly awakened during numerous meetings with Phelan and Valerie, especially on one occasion when he stroked her across the back whilst acting flirtatious ‚Äî even when an oblivious Owen was around during that time. Anna decides to settle the score with Phelan after he delivers a card to her, which she reads and finds out about his inappropriate affection towards her. She invites Phelan to her house and demands that he back off, but he ignores her warning ‚Äî instead of accusing her of trying to come onto him ‚Äî and then appears to make a move on Anna, who eventually throws him out of her house. She later feigns illness to avoid another meeting with Phelan and Valerie at the Bistro, only for her desperation to be perceived by Gary's girlfriend: Owen's older daughter Izzy (Cherylee Houston). When Anna is unable to stop Izzy from prying her suspicions, she reluctantly confines that Phelan attempted to rape her. Izzy comforts Anna and tries to keep Gary from finding out about the incident, but is forced to tell him when he takes notice of the secret. Later on that evening, Gary offers Phelan into having a lift home after work ‚Äî only to end up confronting him once Owen and the other builders have left the worksite. Phelan, rebuffing Gary's demand to stay away from his mother, begins criticizing Anna on her flirtatious behavior ‚Äî causing Gary to snap and punch Phelan; the two promptly descend into a physical fight and Phelan gets the upper hand until Gary ends up striking him over the head with a plank of wood, knocking Phelan unconscious as a result. Gary, believing to have killed Phelan, calls Owen to tell him what has happened and later brings him to the worksite ‚Äî where they are surprised to find that Phelan has vanished. A few days later in March 2014, Phelan reappears at Weatherfield and summons Gary and Owen without the rest of their family's knowledge ‚Äî implicitly telling the duo how he plans to get revenge on them over the incident. When they attempt to end their partnership with Phelan at the following morning, he takes Gary and Owen into the site office and shows them a CCTV footage of Gary attacking him. Phelan assures Gary and Owen that he has further copies and then demands that either they complete the work for a minimum wage ‚Äî gleaning no profit ‚Äî or he would hand the CCTV footage into the police. Despite Gary's reluctance, Owen complies with Phelan's orders as he does not want his grandson Jake to grow up without a father figure if Gary were to be sent to prison. Phelan relishes in blackmailing Owen and Gary, such as ordering the former to wash his car and getting the latter to bury a grave for a dead pigeon. This effectively strains Owen and Gary's friendship, as they begin to take their frustrations out of each other as well as their family. Phelan continues to overwork the pair by forcing them to remove perfectly fitted windows from the building his crewmen are working on, an act which nearly causes Gary to lash out at Phelan until Owen quickly separates him. Gary soon plans to get even on Phelan by stealing a shipment of tiles from him, but Phelan quickly finds out that it was Gary and was ready to report him to the police until Owen manages to stop him ‚Äî pointing out that Gary's wages are already being docked because of the situation he caused in the first place. Phelan agrees not to report Gary to the police, but instead decides to keep the ¬£80,000 that Owen invested onto their business project ‚Äî which turns out to be what Phelan had intended to do all along to exact revenge on Owen for stealing his motorbike and being forced to pay what was owed. When Phelan takes Valerie on a holiday trip the next day, Gary breaks into their house in an attempt to extract the CCTV footage; however, Owen quickly stops him in his tracks ‚Äî reminding Gary that Phelan has multiple copies. The two start planning on seeking other job placements in order to prevent Phelan from blackmailing them any further; however, this fails when Phelan discovers their intentions after learning of the break-in at his house and quickly deducing Gary's role behind it. In retaliation, Phelan arranges for Owen to be removed from the council's list of approved builders ‚Äî effectively blacklisting him, which meant Owen could no longer get any independent work. In April 2014, Phelan demotes Owen from his position as the project's site manager ‚Äî replacing him with a disrespectful foreman: Clive (Gary Whitaker), who constantly antagonizes Owen throughout his shift. Towards the end of the evening, Phelan orders Owen to clean up the worksite alone before leaving the area with Clive ‚Äî who unknowingly forgets to collect his lighter; Owen later finds the lighter and plans on setting fire to the worksite, destroying Phelan's empire in the process. Just as he prepares to do so, however, Anna confronts him for running late in attending Faye's school play and soon learns of the situation that Phelan has inflicted upon their family. After failing to request Valerie in convincing her husband to back down, even when telling her about how the actions Phelan has caused, Anna personally visits Phelan and pleads with him to easy on Gary and Owen; with Anna further stating that Gary had once been in an army and had a traumatic experience of losing his comrades. At first, Phelan appears to ignore Anna's pleas when he insists that she joins him for lunch, but thereupon gives her an indecent proposition: to have sex with him and he would let Gary and Owen go from the project. A disgusted Anna initially refuses to accept Phelan's \\"transaction\\", but decides to give in when she later finds Gary having a mental breakdown over the escalating situation. The next day, Anna meets up with Phelan at the Dunford Hall Hotel ‚Äî where the two have sex as Phelan had planned. Afterwards, Phelan teases Anna as she furiously leaves with a contract that he planted to represent his bargain of their deal. He soon pays the whole family a visit at their house and fulfills his agreement with Anna by telling Gary and Owen that they're out of the project ‚Äî fabricating a story on how Anna spoke to Valerie about the situation and managed to coax her in persuading him to put their differences aside. After getting Owen to sign a contract that releases him and Gary from their duties, Phelan hands over the disc contacting footage evidence of his assault before leaving the house ‚Äî though not before he declares victory against the family, sarcastically tells them \\"It's been a pleasure\\". Phelan subsequently departed Weatherfield with Owen's ¬£80,000 investment off-screen. In June 2014, Phelan sends Anna and Owen a postcard from Dubai ‚Äî further rubbing in his triumphant glory against them. At that point, the couple and their families have been reduced to financial difficulties and are forced to move out of their home; with Owen also being declared an official bankrupt since he is unable to repay all his debts. Though they manage to partly bounce back from their troubles by moving into a new home, Anna eventually admits to Owen that she slept with Phelan to make him leave their family alone. The revelation slowly drove the couple apart from 2015 onwards. By then, however, Valerie had too split up with Phelan upon learning of his true colors ‚Äî rendering him penniless due to his assets being completely entitled to his own wife. =2016‚Äì2018= Pat Phelan returns to Weatherfield in January 2016, having got a job from local builder Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) on his construction business and later working with his friend Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) on his garage expansion at the Webster's Auto Centre. Anna eventually learns of Phelan's return when she witnesses Kevin saving him from a speeding car ‚Äî driven by Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), a pornographic offender, and his accomplice Lee (Aaron Cobham) ‚Äî and he later tells Kevin his own version of what happened between them; with Phelan learning that Owen had already left in 2015 and that Anna is having a relationship with Kevin. Later on, Phelan visits Anna to \\"apologize\\" for destroying her relationship with Owen and promises that he won't cause her any trouble ‚Äî so long as she doesn't cause him any trouble either. Anna complies with reluctance, but later alerts Izzy of Phelan's reappearance and warns her about Gary's reaction to finding out as well. They manage to conceal Phelan's comeback from Gary until he sports him talking with Jason and Kevin at the garage. Gary goes to lash out at Phelan before his mother intervenes; with Gary's best-friend Zeedan Nazir (Qasim Akhtar) helping Anna separate her son from Phelan, whom Jason and Kevin subsequently take with them over to Weatherfield's local pub ‚Äî The Rovers Return. In February 2016, Phelan sabotages the electrics in Kevin's garage to further cement his stay in Weatherfield and Anna takes the news about this so badly that she lashes out at him in a fit of rage; she grabs a sledgehammer and smashes Phelan's van windscreen before attacking him, an act which Kevin witnesses ‚Äî causing him to accuse Anna of being too obsessed with her past and end their relationship. The following day, Phelan visits Anna in the caf√© and demands that she apologize to him in public. When she refuses and tries to stand up for herself, Phelan pins Anna against the wall and continues to threaten her until Kevin abruptly walks in ‚Äî causing him to realize that she was right about him. Kevin promptly orders Phelan to leave, and he later refuses to help fix his damaged windscreen after learning from Anna the truth about their past. This subsequently leads to the two men clashing with each other, during which Kevin tries to warn Jason and his family about Phelan's nature to no avail. When they cross paths again at the Bistro, during which Kevin is dating Anna after their relationship is repaired, he pulls a prank on Phelan by ordering him some wine in a \\"kind\\" act of gesture ‚Äî angering Phelan when he is forced by the staff to pay for his wine order. Undeterred, Phelan manages to settle his new life in Weatherfield and continues to build his companionship with Jason ‚Äî up to the point where spends most of his time at Jason's house and begins flirting with his mother, Eileen (Sue Cleaver). This effectively leads to the pair bonding with one another, but Eileen's boyfriend Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) grows increasingly suspicious of Phelan and they quickly become enemies; with Phelan constantly antagonizing Michael in a plot to deteriorate his relationship with Eileen, who frequently berates a humiliated Michael whenever his efforts to investigate Phelan go too far. At one point, Michael confronts Phelan at Jason's yard and accuses him of stealing his chisels ‚Äî which previously belonged to Jason's former boss Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward); however, Michael ends up having a heart attack and is confined to crutches for a couple of months after getting hospitalized. When Phelan later provokes Michael into lashing out with a crutch in front of Eileen, she promptly breaks up with Michael and throws him out of her house. Phelan uses this opportunity to seduce Eileen and they proceed to form a relationship with each other. When Anna learns about this from Izzy, she plans on visiting Eileen to warn her about Phelan. However, Phelan ‚Äî anticipating this ‚Äî strikes first by fabricating a story to Eileen about how Anna fancied him and they had a one- night stand, which he claims to have immediately regretted; with Phelan admitting that his marriage with Valerie was beyond passionate and further states that Anna is crying rape because the result of their one-night stand had practically ended her relationship with Owen. This works successfully as Eileen would later dismiss Anna's warning about Phelan, sticking to his story about their \\"flinging past\\". Shortly after leaving Eileen's house, Anna bumps into Phelan and the pair grapple again; with Phelan grabbing Anna's arm and taunting her before leaving, though not before making it clear that he'll be staying in Weatherfield for as long as he pleases. As time goes on, Phelan's growing involvement with Eileen and Jason builds up a feud between him and Jason's brother: Todd (Bruno Langley) ‚Äî whom Gary has already warned about Phelan's nature. Whilst investigating his ulterior motives, Todd deduces that Phelan has vandalized the Jamila House Community Centre in order to secure Jason's beneficial partnership with the Freschos supermarket; however, Phelan manages to cover his involvement by sabotaging the CCTV footage that catches him preparing to vandalize the community centre. Though unable to stop Todd's interference, Phelan continues to get close with Jason and soon acts as a father figure towards him ‚Äî particularly when Eileen informs Jason that his father, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), has died from a heart attack. Phelan comforts Jason as he grieves over his father's death, and later comes to his defence when he gets into a fight with Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward) ‚Äî the boyfriend of Jason's ex-lover, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) ‚Äî at The Rovers; in Jason's defence, Phelan pins Aidan against a booth and threatens him before his father Johnny (Richard Hawley) arrives to witness his son being throttled. When Phelan ignores his demand to release his son, Johnny punches him to save Aidan and the pair nearly brawl until they are forced to settle down; Phelan later has another run-in with Johnny and, rejecting his apology, promises to get even with him one day before leaving when Johnny's girlfriend, Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), intervenes. In June 2016, Phelan hatches a plot to usurp Jason and takeover his construction company: the Builder's Yard. He first takes advantage of Jason's grievance by implicating him for the murder of his late enemy, Callum Logan (Sean Ward) ‚Äî an act which leads Callum's close friend, Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell), to break up with Jason after they recently formed a relationship together. Phelan then proceeds to sabotage Jason's venture, first by stealing his newly-arrived windows from the builder's yard ‚Äî which Phelan had deliberately left unlocked ‚Äî and then arranging for his van to be torched under the guise that Callum's associates were behind it. The pressure soon grows too much for Jason and he decides to leave Weatherfield for a fresh start in Thailand, allowing Phelan to take control of the Builder's Yard and become Weatherfield's new landlord. With his newfound position, Phelan begins to exploit Jason's operation by increasing the pay rises from several local residents ‚Äî even though Jason left Eileen to manage his organization during his absence. In the midst of rising to power at Weatherfield, Phelan ends up swindling a number of Weatherfield residents on multiple occasions; amongst these people include local newsagent Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) and restaurant owner Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). On the former incident, Phelan arranges for Norris to lose a shipment of tiles for his broken roof at The Kabin Corner Shop ‚Äî causing Norris to accept Phelan's \\"help\\" in getting the roof fixed at a cheaper rate. On the latter incident, Phelan impairs the Bistro's electrics at the request of Robert's successor Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) to trick Robert into thinking that the problem should be checked by the person who installed them. Eventually, Phelan seizes an opportunity to move into Eileen's house when they learn that Todd has recently embarked on an affair with local vicar Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) ‚Äî who is in a relationship with Jason and Todd's adopted brother, Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). This is successful after Phelan manipulates Sean into believing that Eileen knew about Todd and Billy's affair, prompting him to move out of the house when he forces Eileen to choose either him or Todd ‚Äî and she ends up choosing Todd. After moving into her house, Phelan continues to increase his relationship with Eileen; however, he finds his fueling conflict with Todd escalating at the same time ‚Äî particularly when Todd pranks Phelan in the shower after finding out that his actions have caused Jason to leave Weatherfield and Sean to move out of the house respectively. In August 2016, Phelan formulates a plan to steal Jason's ¬£65,000 inheritance; he summons his old friend Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey), a crooked property developer, over to Weatherfield and the two discuss their plans on launching a scam project called \\"Calcutta Street\\" ‚Äî which consists on a development of non-existent flats. Their first act is to get the planning permission confirmed from the local council; to do this, Phelan negotiates with Kevin's ex-wife Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) ‚Äî the recently elected Mayor of Weatherfield ‚Äî in order to gain her approval. At first, she agrees with his proposition but later considers withdrawing her support when Todd points out that the local community youth hall may get demolished as a result. Needing to acquire a building so he can put forward with extra affordable housings, Phelan manipulates cafe worker Alex Warner (Liam Bairstow) into using his film club for Calcutta Street's redevelopment ‚Äî an act which secures Sally's consent when she promises to speak to the committee on his behalf. With all obstacles now removed, Phelan persuades Eileen to convince Jason is using his ¬£65,000 investment for the project. In doing so, he and Vinny manage to get their planning application accepted ‚Äî thus enabling them to put their scam project into fruition. However, Todd's constant interfering leads him to discover the scam himself. After rejecting his offer to be invited in working on the project, Todd reports Phelan to the police for fraud and his mother's supposed departure; however, Phelan is released due to lack of evidence and the fact that Eileen has gone on a holiday ‚Äî which Vinny helped Phelan carry out in order to prevent Todd from alerting her of his discovery about the scam. When Todd once again threatens to expose their fraudulent scheme, Phelan warns him that Vinny had originally planned to kill him and Eileen because of his constant interference. He eventually convinces Todd to put their differences aside for his mother's sake, and the two subsequently work together in helping Vinny complete the scam development ‚Äî though Todd makes Phelan promise that his family will be protected and refunded at all costs. In October 2016, Phelan becomes unnerved when Eileen and Vinny start to doubt each other midway through the course of the scam; with Eileen growing concerned over the \\"Calcutta Street\\" development after learning that Vinny has not hired any contractors for the operation, and Vinny becoming enraged at Eileen for spending his ¬£30,000 on a shipment of tiles without his consent. At first, Phelan is able to medicate their differences in order to prevent Eileen from discovering the scam, but she continues to grow suspicious of Vinny and later finds out from her next-door neighbor Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) that Vinny has gone to a casino. Eileen, suspecting Vinny of planning to con them, insists that Phelan takes her to confront him at the casino; he obliges, but not before calling Vinny to warn him that Eileen is planning to intercept them. As it turns out, Vinny has met up with his consociate Russ (Tomi May) to collect fake passports for himself and Phelan. When he and Eileen arrive at the casino, Phelan is relieved when Vinny manages to convince her that his intentions are otherwise and that Russ ‚Äî addressed as \\"Mr. Russell\\" ‚Äî is one of his potential buyers. In response, Eileen apologises to Vinny for disrupting his meeting and returns home with Phelan. Back at Weatherfield, Phelan berates Eileen for her interference and accuses her of not trusting him. This nearly ends their relationship, but Phelan later makes amends by cooking Eileen dinner to apologize for snapping at her. Eileen forgives Phelan and she resumes helping him out on his unsuspecting scam project, but later decides to reclaim her old job at the \\"Street Cars\\" taxi company at Phelan's insistence. Nevertheless, their relationship continues and Phelan soon proposes to Eileen; she accepts his proposal and they celebrate their engagement at the pub. In November 2016, Michael grows concerned over the \\"Calcutta Street\\" development and concludes that Phelan has been defrauding the residents of Weatherfield over the last few months ‚Äî with him and Vinny seizing all the cash deposits from several victims, including Gary's girlfriend Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien); Jenny's foster mother Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox); and Zeedan's grandmother Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King) themselves. Michael's theory grows as Phelan attempts to con Yasmeen's ex- husband Sharif (Marc Anwar) and later Alex himself, though the latter is spared when his aunt Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill) acquires him a flat that isn't amongst the \\"Calcutta Street\\" apartments. After preventing his friend Freddie Smith (Derek Griffiths) from getting conned by the duo in a poker game, Michael seeks Anna's help in exposing Vinny's scam so Phelan can be brought to justice. Ironically, Anna's adoptive daughter Faye (Ellie Leach) had unwittingly stolen Phelan's phone and Anna ‚Äî who had initially refused to help Michael in a bid to move on from Phelan ‚Äî became aware of the scam herself upon discovering this. Working together against their shared enemy, Michael breaks into Vinny's yard to extract evidence whilst Anna invites Phelan in an attempt to delay him. She tries to bribe Phelan in leaving Weatherfield with ¬£2,000 after confronting him about their differences, with Anna pointing out that he is merely just using Eileen since their relationship had begun, but he rejects her offer and is just about to leave when his phone suddenly rings ‚Äî causing Phelan to learn of the conspiracy. After answering the call to confirm his suspicions, Phelan leaves Anna after promising to make her regret \\"crossing him\\" before smashing her house out of anger. He then confronts Michael at the yard with a crowbar just as the latter gets hold of Phelan's fake passport. Initially calling his bluff of reporting him to the police, knowing that doing so would expose his involvement in the scam, Michael grows uneasy when Phelan makes clear of his intent to kill him. With his life in danger and unable to persuade Phelan in turning himself in, Michael throws a chair at him and flees from the yard ‚Äî with Phelan in pursuit. When crossing paths again, Michael suffers a heart attack when he makes a break for it and pleads help from an unfazed Phelan. Rather than help his rival as he previously did before, however, Phelan reclaims his passport and ‚Äî declaring victory in the feud between them ‚Äî tells Michael that his \\"time is up\\", further linking his fate to a rabbit that Phelan had once shot with an air rifle; with Phelan subsequently watching the rabbit die as he didn't have the \\"bottle\\" to put it out its misery. Phelan then goes to clear out the mess that was left at the site office, leaving Michael for dead in the process. Anna alerts Gary to the situation and he heads down to confront Phelan but does not notice a dying Michael succumbing to his heart attack and taking his last breath. Once all is settled, Phelan approaches Michael's corpse and silently bids him goodbye with a sign of the cross before walking away. Phelan later alerts Vinny of what happened and, informing him about Michael's death as well as the impact he has left them on, suggests that the pair leave immediately to avoid any further suspicion. On the day of their scheduled departure from Weatherfield, however, Phelan discovers that Vinny has already left the country for Hawaii upon chatting with his landlady (Jacqueline Pilton). Unable to contact Vinny as the number has been disconnected, Phelan calls the bank to confirm his fears that all the money from the business account has been withdrawn; he screams Vinny's name in rage upon learning of his betrayal. Phelan soon returns home to Eileen and Todd, who informs him of Michael's death. Phelan feigns shock about Michael, but secretly confides in Todd that Vinny has left with the money and gone abroad. Phelan is later questioned by the police about Michael's death and Vinny's escape, but he manages to cover his involvement in both circumstances. However, when Eileen notices the police questioning him, Phelan is forced to come clean and is promptly slapped by a furious Eileen; she then kicks him out of the house. When Todd organises a meeting with the residents involved in Calcutta Street, Phelan arrives at the last minute to take responsibility for the scam ‚Äî admitting that he is solely to blame due to his association with Vinny, whereas both Eileen and Todd are completely innocent because of it. Though this leads many residents to resent him over the scam ordeal, Eileen forgives Phelan for his actions and the pair slowly reconcile to resume with their wedding plans ‚Äî after Michael's funeral. Towards the end of the year, Phelan learns that Anna has been sending multiple letters of complaints against him and Eileen over the scam and later threatens her. Kevin soon learns about the threat made against Anna and confronts Phelan, nearly attacking him when Phelan reacts indifferently until fellow mechanic Luke Britton (Dean Fagan) intervenes to separate the pair. Later on that night, Phelan gets struck over the head with a brick by Luke's best friend: Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) ‚Äî who correctly assumes that Phelan murdered Michael, whom Andy recently had a surrogate father-son relationship with even though the pair weren't actually related. Phelan, however, survives the attack and subsequently blackmails Andy into performing a series of petty crimes under the threat of reporting him to the police and having him charged with attempted murder. After forcing Andy to steal money and later tablets from the Bistro, Phelan begins to coerce him into sabotaging Kevin's business ‚Äî culminating when Andy is forced to set fire to his garage, though not before Phelan personally spikes Kevin's drink to distract the mechanic long enough for Andy to proceed with his deed. When Andy sets the garage on fire, however, he steals the laptop containing CCTV footage of Phelan and Todd talking about \\"Calcutta Street\\" and their involvement within the scam project. He soon explains this to his girlfriend, Luke's sister Steph (Tisha Merry), upon confessing to everything due to Phelan's blackmail; Steph, through angry at Andy, forgives him when she learns that Phelan threatened to harm her as well. Planning to leave for Portugal together, Steph goes along while Andy stays behind to incriminate Phelan. His attempt is halted when Phelan arrives to bid him farewell, only to discover the laptop in the room which is playing the CCTV footage video of him and Todd unknowingly incriminating themselves. Things get heated when Phelan realizes that Andy is recording their conversation about the scam and Michael, which quickly turns into a confrontation when Andy knocks Phelan out for taunting him over Michael. Rising to his feet, Phelan engages Andy in a brawl and gets the upper hand despite being pummeled multiple times. He then grabs the laptop and, recalling this story to have a different ending in contrast to \\"the bad guy getting his comeuppance\\", smashes Andy on the head with it ‚Äî supposedly killing him. After sending a text to Steph from Andy's mobile phone to dump her, causing her to leave the country alone, Phelan goes on to meet Eileen at the wedding reception where they get married; with Todd and Billy present as well. In February 2017, Phelan catches Faye and her boyfriend Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) nicking his tools from his backyard. Though Eileen wishes to report them to the police, Phelan decides to hire Seb for assistance with a kitchen job that local resident Ken Barlow (William Roache) has requested. They quickly bond as Phelan believes that he can teach Seb something rather than leaving him rendered as a troublesome delinquent, such as the case when Phelan catches Seb attempting to steal Ken's medal and orders him to put him back. When Seb gets arrested for attacking Faye's old classmate Jackson Hodge (Rhys Cadman), the teenage father of their baby daughter Miley, she requests Phelan to take her for visits at the \\"Larchfield Young Offenders Institute\\" ‚Äî where Seb is serving a couple of months sentence for Jackson's assault. This infuriates Anna, who has disapproved of her daughter's relationship with Seb ever since his arrest and has grown further stoked when Faye starts bonding with Phelan. At one point, while Faye is waiting in Phelan's red van to visit Seb at the delinquent centre, Anna steals his vehicle and drives off with her daughter. Phelan oversees this and confronts Kevin, threatening to call the police until Anna shortly returns with his red van ‚Äî sparking yet another row between them when Phelan mocks Anna's parenting skills, while she warns him to stay away from Faye. As a result, Phelan refuses to take Faye with him in visiting Seb at the delinquent centre. In March 2017, Phelan finds himself stressed with Todd recalling Michael's death on multiple occasions. Todd soon notices Phelan's attitude and, suspecting his involvement in Michael's death, begins hassling the builder whilst helping him out with his ongoing shift at Ken's house. Later on, Luke requests Phelan for help with a leaking problem that is causing trouble with the lights at his house; Phelan manages to fix the lights at Luke's house, but is on the verge of losing his temper when Todd continues to taunt his stepfather ‚Äî linking the topic of spirits to both Michael's death and the murder of Luke's old house owner: Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), who was fatally murdered by the ruthless Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis) on the night Anna told Owen about what Phelan did to her in 2014. Though he continues to ignore Todd for most of the period, Phelan later becomes distressed when he ends up hearing a mysterious voice whilst plumbing at Luke's house. When he finds out that Todd has been recording him at Luke's house as part of his pranking agenda, Phelan is barely able to contain his anger and later ends up lashing out at his stepson ‚Äî throttling Todd after growing further aggravated with his behavior. By then, the impact Todd has inflicted upon Phelan has distracted him from his kitchen job at Ken's residence. They soon have a disagreement when Phelan grows frustrated with Ken's constant demands to speed up the work on his kitchen progress and becomes outraged when Ken ‚Äî accusing Phelan of dishonesty due to his knowledge of the \\"Calcutta Street\\" incident ‚Äî refuses to pay him for the job. This could have been a motive for Phelan when Ken is later found unconscious at the bottom of his stairs that night (see Who Attacked Ken?), and he himself becomes a prime suspect on the police investigation along with Ken's family. He is soon taken in for questioning when Ken's son Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) informs the police that Phelan had never phoned an ambulance when finding his father unconscious on the night of the attack, and his adoptive sister Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) later recalls Phelan's quarrel with their father on the day before his attack; the accusations made by Ken's children have additionally caused Todd and several residents, including Ken's close friends Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), to believe that Phelan is the assailant. At the police station, Phelan is interrogated by DS MacKinnon (Sandra Huggett) ‚Äî the policewoman leading the investigation on Ken's attack ‚Äî and her assistant DC Hough (Philip Hill- Pearson) over his fraught interaction with Ken. Afterwards, Phelan calls Todd with a desperate request of providing him an alibi. Todd initially refuses to help Phelan, reminding him of their recent altercation, but later changes his mind when he finds evidence of his stepfather's innocence; Todd's earlier recording of Phelan had captured the exact time when he was fixing Luke's house. Because of this, Phelan is eliminated from the enquirers of Ken's investigating attack and he later invites Todd for a drink in The Rovers as thanks; with the pair finally embarking on a mutual bond as they make amends with each other. Later on, Phelan visits Ken's house to inform the family of his alibi and they accept his innocence from the incident. When Eileen returns from her holiday in April 2017, Phelan surprises her with a special gift; a car which she won in the green initiative competition, which Phelan had secretly arranged for his wife to partake in a bid to further pull the wool of her eyes in the process. Phelan gives her driving lessons, and she eventually passes her test in the next month. At this stage, Phelan has bonded with a number of Weatherfield locals; most notably with Eileen's latest house guest, Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding) ‚Äî whom Billy has discovered when she got kicked out of her old home by her abusive pimp ex-boyfriend: Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper). During one of his visits at Seb's youth detention center, Phelan notices Shona visiting a fellow young offender and later questions her about this; she claims to have been seeing her nephew \\"Tom\\" over his twoccing activities, leaving Phelan unaware that Shona has actually been visiting her son Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison) ‚Äî a convicted killer. When Phelan later hears that Clayton has been attacked in prison, he passes the information onto Gary's former adversary: Sarah's brother David (Jack P. Shepherd, who is pleased with the news ‚Äî as Clayton has murdered David's wife, murdered wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), back in July 2016. David's reaction leads to Eileen virtually running him over near the spot where Kylie was murdered, in the midst of Phelan testing her driving abilities. When David kicks Shona out of the house when he discovers the truth about her relation to Clayton, she once again stays at Phelan's house; with Phelan pointing out that everyone like Shona deserves a second chance, despite Todd's objections. In June 2017, Phelan continues to build his mentorship on Seb and soon meets his social worker: Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp). During their meetings over Seb's apprenticeship, Phelan apparently recognizes Nicola as her surname becomes familiar to him ‚Äî which stands to reason that Phelan has some sort of history with Nicola. She eventually gets drawn into his suspicions after overhearing Phelan extract documents and photographs of her. When confronting Phelan about this, he arranges to meet with Nicola at her late parents' bench so he can explain himself. However, when Nicola doesn't turn up, he returns to find her going through his paperwork in the yard. She accuses Phelan of stalking her and threatens to get the police involved, just as Eileen then walks in to confront Phelan over her suspicions that he fancies Nicola; with Eileen having just discovered that Phelan had recently taken Nicola and Seb to Liverpool behind her back. Under the pressure of their questioning, Phelan eventually asserts to Nicola that he thinks she is his daughter ‚Äî explaining that he previously had an affair with her mother, Annabel, for over a year. Though Eileen is shocked over her husband's theory, Nicola is disbelieving and initially wants nothing to do with Phelan; however, she continues interacting with him through the next month ‚Äî in which Seb becomes involved in the situation after Phelan fires him for incompetence, only to later reinstate him at Nicola's urging. She soon agrees to do a DNA test, which confirms that Phelan is Nicola's biological father. Phelan happily proceeds to bond with Nicola, even though she continues to struggle in coping with the discoveries she has made about her parents; however, Nicola eventually begins to settle with her life in Weatherfield ‚Äî with Phelan's help. They continue to expand their father-daughter relationship in August 2017, during which Nicola moves into her father's house and ends up learning about the \\"Calcutta Street\\" incident from Yasmeen; however, she comforts Phelan and supports him after hearing how much he has worked in trying to rebuild both his venture and the local community's trust. Phelan continues to impress Nicola when he acquires a flat for her near Weatherfield, and later comforts his daughter after she breaks up with her boyfriend: Scott (Christopher Goh) ‚Äî a local policeman whom Phelan had recently helped convert an old house into a youth centre. At this stage, their growing father-daughter relationship soon begins to appeal with Phelan's nature when he finds Michael's ex-wife Gail (Helen Worth) mourning his death. Phelan, apparently divulged into guilt over his role behind Michael's death, goes to a catholic church and nearly reveals the truth to the priest inside the confessional booth; however, he changes his mind at the last second and leaves ‚Äî though not before admitting \\"There's something that I've done..... something that I'm still doing\\". It is soon revealed in mid-August 2017 that Phelan never killed Andy, but has instead chained him up in the cellar of an abandoned property and kept him captive since their last confrontation on Phelan's wedding day; this explains Phelan's admission during his church visit, as well as the number of times that he has been skulking behind his wife's back ‚Äî including the reason behind a black eye he caught a couple of months ago. Since keeping Andy captive for eight months, Phelan has psychologically tormented him through near-death experiences and torture; with Phelan forcibly restraining Andy when he attempts to strange his captor in a failed attempt to escape at one point, and later nearly executing him with a shovel when Andy feels unwell following the incident in another stage. Phelan initially contemplates leaving Andy to die, but has a change of heart after overhearing Nicola telling Billy how appreciated she feels towards him since the DNA test; Phelan acquires some antibiotics from Eileen's best friend Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) at the dentist, feigning a toothache to cover up his secret, before delivering them to Andy ‚Äî saving his life in the process. When Liz informs Eileen about Phelan's visit to the dentist, she confronts him at the house just as Phelan is checking up on Andy's condition. Eileen nearly discovers Phelan's secret, but he manages to stall her ‚Äî surprisingly with Andy's help; Eileen takes the bait when Phelan claims that he is working on getting them a new home using the abandoned property. In apparent gratitude for not blowing his secret, Phelan decides to let Andy go free and arranges for him to get out of the country for a new life in France. On the way to the airport, Phelan crashes his van and is seemingly left unconscious. At first, Andy calls an ambulance, but quickly uses this opportunity to make a break for it. However, Phelan awakens and catches up to Andy before telling him that his promised \\"freedom\\" was actually a test of demonstrating his loyalty. Phelan then recaptures Andy by knocking him out before taking his prisoner back to the warehouse, where Eileen confronts him once more with Nicola's help ‚Äî as the pair have found themselves deceived by Phelan into thinking that he had left town for a job at Inverness. After managing to cover-up his reasons once again, Phelan brings Andy back to the cellar and tells him that he will be staying there until he comes up with a better solution on how to truly solve the ongoing problem between them. Towards the end of September 2017, Phelan becomes unsettled when Daniel begins to use the \\"Calcutta Street\\" incident for his latest journalism idea and soon ends up questioning a number of residents ‚Äî including Tyrone's fianc√©e Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) and even Anna herself ‚Äî about their theories on the scam. This evidently builds up a conflict between the pair when Phelan confronts Daniel at his flat; with Daniel making it clear that he intends to expose his involvement behind the scam, prompting Phelan to warn Daniel that he will \\"hurt him\\" should he continue to pursue his newspaper article project. Ignoring Phelan's threat, Daniel resumes his investigation until Phelan ends up catching him in a passionate position with his boss: Cindy Watson (Esther Hall). Their \\"interaction\\" allows Phelan to obstruct Daniel's trial before gathering information on Cindy, culminating when he finds out that she is married. He then proceeds to entrap Daniel and Cindy at the Bistro, where her husband Ross (Anthony Brophy) walks in on them; Ross threatens Daniel to stay away from his wife before ordering Cindy to leave with him, thus causing Daniel to stop investigating the story any further. However, Daniel's curiosity leads Phelan to Vinny's mother: Flora McArdle (Eileen Davies). It transpires that Vinny's real name is Harvey McArdle, and Phelan begins to contact Vinny from Flora's care home in order to get his money back and exact revenge on Vinny for his betrayal. Upon blackmailing Vinny in returning to Weatherfield, Phelan informs Andy that Vinny will be his replacement prisoner once the latter has been captured; Andy had earlier made an initially-rejected bargain with Phelan that he would acquire another prisoner, who Andy would then keep hostage if Phelan were to let him go. After surviving an assassination attempt, Phelan surprises Vinny when he arrives to save Flora the next day. Phelan punches Vinny before giving him an ultimatum; either Vinny delivers the money within, or Phelan would kill Flora to show the pair what he's truly capable of doing. Vinny complies and manages to deliver the money to Phelan, but is then knocked out when Phelan appears to take him in seeing his mother; Phelan assures Vinny that his mother is safe ‚Äî before telling the latter the opposite for his case. Phelan then takes the captured Vinny to meet Andy, whom he had earlier manipulated into believing that Vinny had killed Michael. When Vinny awakens and vows to kill his ex-cohort, Phelan secretly instructs Andy to kill Vinny in order to secure his freedom. Andy becomes extremely hesitant but is unable to change Phelan's insistence. After knocking Vinny unconscious, Phelan takes him and Andy to an abandoned warehouse for Vinny's execution. There, Vinny jumps on Phelan; however, Andy untimely warns his captor ‚Äî allowing Phelan to brutally subdue Vinny before forcing Andy to drag his body into the warehouse. Phelan then gives Andy a gun, which Phelan had secretly acquired earlier on to carry out his plot against Vinny, and begins to pressure his captive in fulling his deed by fabricating a story about Michel's death ‚Äî professing how Vinny told him that he relished in watching Michael die rather than finishing him off. Vinny slowly regains consciousness, but it's too late as Andy ultimately gives in and shoots at his fellow prisoner ‚Äî killing Vinny in front of Phelan. A guilt- ridden Andy proceeds to turn the gun on Phelan, who manages to reclaim the weapon after talking his captive out of it. However, rather than letting Andy go as promised, Phelan instead turns the gun on him and ‚Äî ignoring his desperate appeals that he isn't a murderer ‚Äî pulls the trigger on Andy, killing him. He \\"apologizes\\" to Andy for granting him death, but states that he wouldn't have been able to live with himself for murdering Vinny. After reciting a prayer at the corpses, Phelan dumps the bodies in a nearby lake before returning to Eileen. They later went on a holiday together for a couple of weeks, but upon returning learn that their new house ‚Äî where Phelan had kept Andy captive ‚Äî was involved in an arson attack; it soon turns out that Phelan had discreetly organized the arson attack by bribing two hooligans to burn the house down. Using the money that he forced Vinny to deliver prior to killing him, Phelan takes the opportunity to repay all the Calcutta Street victims ‚Äî creating goodwill in the Weatherfield community, and thus cheering up Eillen as she was saddened over the arson attack. It was at this point, however, that Nicola had learned about her father's past with Anna when they were both called into hospital after Seb had been involved in a ladder accident ‚Äî with Anna finding him and calling an ambulance. As they waited for Seb's recovery that night, Anna struck a conversation with Nicola before eventually describing the events with her father from 2014; with Anna explaining how Phelan blackmailed her into sleeping with him after tormenting Gary and Owen. This prompted Nicola into visiting her mother's old friend Lydia Hartman (Susan Twist) the next day, seeking out answers on Phelan's nature; with Nicola having noticed Lydia's horrific reaction at seeing an image of Phelan on her phone from the last time she recently visited at her house. Nicola learns that the last time Lydia saw Phelan was on the night he had a fight with Annabel's lover Isaac, and on the following day Annabel had told Lydia that Phelan had forced himself onto her. When Nicola demands to know the truth behind her origins, she is horrified when Lydia reveals that was told by Annabel that Phelan had forced himself onto her ‚Äî causing Nicola to realize that Phelan had actually raped her mother, in contrast to his original claim of having an affair with Annabel, just nine months before she herself was born. An enraged Nicola summoned Phelan to her late parents' bench park, whereupon she confronts him for the allegations made by Anna and Lydia. He unsuccessfully attempts to assuage her suspicions by proclaiming his love for her mother, stating that Annabel wanted to save her marriage to Isaac ‚Äî precisely relating to Anna's story. This escalates into an argument when Phelan argues that Anna is to blame for her ordeal, only for Nicola to brand him a rapist upon realizing that Anna and Lydia were both telling the truth about him; Phelan overreacts when Nicola ends up calling him evil and pleads with her to believe his theories, but she refuses and angrily disowns him in response. Though she initially plans to tell Eileen the truth about him, Nicola instead decides to leave Weatherfield ‚Äî at Anna's suggestion to avoid Phelan. Upon learning that Anna had exposed their past to Nicola behind his back, Phelan hatches a spiteful plot to frame her for Seb's ladder accident in an act of revenge. His scheme indirectly comes to fruition after Phelan seizes Anna's earring from an earlier altercation between then ‚Äî in which he taunted her over Kevin's recent affair with Erica Holroyd (Claire King) and Katy's coincidental death from a road collision; Katy previously left Weatherfield with her son Joseph to be with her mother Linda Hancock (Jacqueline Leonard) in Portugal after failing to help Owen overcome his ordeal with Phelan, which partly led to Owen's departure from Weatherfield after his relationship with Anna ended, and her resulting death leads to Joseph staying with his father and Fiz's brother Chesney (Sam Aston) ‚Äî next-door to Phelan's house. Phelan first executes his revenge plan on Anna by infiltrating Todd's workplace at the \\"Barlow Legal Service\\" ‚Äî where Seb fell off his ladder ‚Äî and then tricking his personal assistant, Kevin's older daughter Rosie (Helen Flanagan), into believing that Todd has sent him to collect his guide book from the building; Rosie's negligence allows Phelan to secretly plant Anna's earring at Todd's office. Afterwards, he visits Seb at the hospital and whispers into his ear that Anna wanted him dead ‚Äî causing him to believe that she pushed him off the ladder. Because of Seb's misinterpretation and the earring's discovery, Anna is arrested when she is accused of the crime; though she is released without charge and quickly discovers Phelan's scheme. When she confronts him over his plan to set her up for Seb's accident, Phelan reveals to Anna that Gary got Nicola pregnant ‚Äî following a recent one-night stand between them ‚Äî and threatens to secure her imprisonment unless she and Gary have Nicola return to Weatherfield. Anna seemingly complies with Phelan's ultimatum, but later attempts to extract a confession from him after hearing the news that he repaid all the \\"Calcutta Street\\" victims. She invites Phelan over to her house for a drink under the guise of putting their differences aside; however, he smells a rat when she questions his motives of framing her and cunningly denies his involvement behind Seb's accident ‚Äî leading a furious Anna to throw him out after her plan has failed. Unable to blackmail Anna in bringing Nicola back to Weatherfield, Phelan visits Seb that night and proceeds to manipulate him into believing that she pushed him off the ladder; Anna is subsequently arrested once more, and she ends up being remanded in custody until her trial starts at January 2018. In December 2017, Phelan hires a private investigator to track down his daughter in Manchester and proceeds to have Gary visit Nicola in an attempt to convince her to return to Weatherfield ‚Äî threatening to expose their one-night stand to Sarah otherwise. Gary seemingly complies, but secretly advises Nicola to leave the country so she could escape Phelan for good; in response, Phelan turns Faye and Seb against Gary by manipulating the pair in moving to his house. This enrages Gary, who thereafter tells Faye about Phelan raping their mother. At first, Faye misinterprets the belief that her mother's motive of sleeping with Phelan was for money, but she soon confronts him when the pair learn that Anna has escaped prison in the midst of being rushed to hospital ‚Äî with Faye catching Phelan's delightful reaction to hearing the news of her mother's situation. Phelan tries to avoid answering Faye's question about his past with Anna, but is unable to contain the pressure from Faye's questioning and inadvertently frightens her out of the house after calling her mother a \\"waste of space\\". Faye thereupon moves back with Gary after realizing the troubles that Phelan inflicted upon their family, and they manage to secretly bring their mother back to Weatherfield undetected; with Faye's friend Craig Tinker (Colson Smith), an adolescent special constable, providing reluctant assistance on the Windass' behalf. After reuniting with her children and taking refuge at her workplace, \\"Roy's Rolls\\", Anna decides to prove her innocence by infiltrating Phelan's yard and then investigating his scheme against her. Gary accompanies his mother with the plan and manages to get Phelan out of the yard by tricking him into believing that Nicola has been rushed to the hospital. Anna sneaks into the yard unnoticed while Gary leads Phelan away from Weatherfield. While attempting to gain progress in uncovering Phelan's strategy, Anna hears someone entering into the yard and ‚Äî believing the person to be Phelan ‚Äî ends up lashing out with a bolt cutter; however, she is mortified to find that she knocked out Eileen instead. Horrified at what she has done, Anna rushes out of the yard to plan a getaway escape with Faye. In the meantime, Phelan has realized that Nicola never called in sick and abandons Gary at the hospital when he attempts to further lead his enemy astray. Upon arriving back at the yard, Phelan finds Anna just as she returned to check up on Eileen and she flees to make her getaway escape; Phelan proceeds to call an ambulance for Eileen and the police on Anna, which results in the latter getting rearrested after she and Faye are unable to make their getaway escape. When Phelan later visits her and threatens her family in his promise to exact further revenge on Eileen's mistaken attack, she lashes out and slaps him across the face ‚Äî provoking him into pressing charges for assault. In early January 2018, on the verge of Anna's trial starting, Phelan finds himself pressured with Luke studying the events of Andy's disappearance from one of his wire houses ‚Äî which Eileen had founded from the burned warehouse where Phelan had kept Andy captive; the wire house was given to Rosie's sister Sophie (Brooke Vincent), who then gave it to Luke when he recalled how Andy always liked making wire houses. Phelan resorts to obstructing Luke's investigation on Andy and starts by giving him a false address of Andy's location in Birmingham, causing Luke to be sent on a while goose chase until he returns with no new leads. When Luke resumes with his quest to uncover Andy's whereabouts, Phelan bribes his childhood friend Matt Luscombe (Sebastian Shaw) into letting Luke believe that Andy had left Weatherfield for Bristol. However, Luke soon realizes that something is up after catching Phelan and Matt discussing their agreement at a restaurant. After forcing an explanation from Matt, who truthfully states that he has no idea of where Andy is. Luke heads over to confront Phelan at the site near the same warehouse where Andy was murdered. At first Phelan attempts to deceive Luke into believing that Andy is playing him for a fool, reminding him how Andy once tricked Michael into believing that he was his real son Gavin (Mark Holgate), but ends up escalating Luke's curiosity when he realizes that Phelan is avoiding all his questions. As their conversation slowly becomes argumentative, Luke suspects that Phelan is hiding something from him and decides to report Andy as a missing person to the police. Phelan, realizing that Luke is getting too close to the truth about Andy, sneaks up behind him and smacks Luke on the head with a rock; however, Luke fights back and knocks Phelan onto the ground before retreating in his car. Phelan pursues Luke in the van and, after a spectacular car chase between them, manages to crash his car into a wall, totalling it and injuring Luke. Knowing that he could expose his secret about Andy's fate, Phelan shoots Luke as the young mechanic desperately attempts to escape out of his car and proceeds to fire two gunshots at its petrol tank ‚Äî causing the vehicle to instantaneously explode, destroying it and killing Luke in the process; in his last moments, Luke learned the truth about Andy when Phelan indirectly revealed his fate. The next morning, Phelan feigns surprise when the residents find out about Luke's death after the police turn up at the street to inform the devastating news to his girlfriend: Yasmeen's granddaughter Alya (Sair Khan). However, she assumes that the culprits are her former racist clients: \\"The Parker Brothers\\" ‚Äî whom Luke had recently attacked for insulting Alya before getting arrested and later charged for their assault on New Year's Day 2018. With this theory, the truth about Luke's murder is undiscovered and Phelan proceeds to cover-up his involvement by leading the local residents to clap on Alya's behalf when she makes a public statement to the press about Luke ‚Äî explaining how he defended her from the \\"Parker Brothers\\" before they burned down his garage in retaliation for their assault; the \\"Parker Brothers\\" are later arrested for Luke's murder, but ends up getting released without charge ‚Äî which further convinces the Weatherfield residents of their guilt. On the day of Luke's funeral, Phelan grows unnerved when Steph reappears at Weatherfield to deliver a eulogy for her brother. He later attempts to offer his sympathies over her brother's death but is brushed off when Steph makes it clear that she already knows about Andy's ordeal. When Steph becomes determined to stay in Weatherfield once more, Gary seeks her help in his campaign against Phelan and the two plan on meeting each other in secret; with Steph intending to divulge Andy's ordeal to Gary. However, Phelan strikes first when he corners Steph at the garage and tricks her into believing that he wishes to send a personal message to Andy in Portugal ‚Äî causing Steph to believe that Phelan has unfinished business with Andy, despite admitting to having no clue of his whereabouts. This succeeds in driving Steph out of Weatherfield again when she later leaves the street for Portugal, much to Gary's disappointment. Although most the residents are unaware of Phelan's involvement behind Luke's murder, Seb grows increasingly suspicious with the rumors that Luke was gunned down and starts to assume that Phelan is the culprit ‚Äî having recalled the night Phelan showed him the gun prior to Luke's death; after learning that Gary was due to work at Legacy Reach Paper Mill ‚Äî the place where Andy and Vinny died ‚Äî Phelan took an opportunity to incriminate Seb for their murders by deceiving his apprentice in touching the gun, which Phelan professes is to protect Eileen from Vinny after claiming to have received constant death threats over the scam incident. On the night of Luke's vigil, Phelan catches Seb sneaking through his tool box and confronts him over his suspicious attitude. Seb nervously claims to have searched for a bottle of whisky from their earlier drink-off, which Phelan had conducted on the night he carried out his plan to frame Seb for the killings but is forced to come clean about his anxiety regarding the circumstances behind Luke's death. To Seb's shock, Phelan reminds him that his fingerprints have already been imprinted onto the gun ‚Äî causing his apprentice to realize that Phelan was the one who murdered Luke. Fearing that Phelan may kill him next, Seb leaves his house and goes to stay with his mother: Abi (Sally Carman), a struggling drug addict who recently lost custody of her Seb's twins Charlie and Lexi back in October 2017. Phelan bribes Abi for information on Seb's whereabouts, intending to use him for his ongoing scheme against Anna. However, Gary manages to find Seb first and reports Phelan to the police after learning that he killed Luke ‚Äî only for Phelan to end up getting released without charge due to the lack of evidence. When Seb learns about Phelan's release, he attempts to leave Weatherfield and even refuses to help Gary prove his mother's innocence; in response, Gary forces Seb into a taxi with help from Faye's biological father Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and the pair urge him to do the right thing for Anna. On the day of Anna's trial, Phelan testifies against her by recounting the time she slapped Seb across the face mere moments before his ladder accident occurred. He then expects his apprentice to confirm his theory when Seb is called up next; to his surprise, however, Seb betrays Phelan by changing his statement and confirming Anna's story ‚Äî pointing Phelan as the perpetrator behind the incident, in front of the court. This apparently helps with Anna's case when Eileen starts to doubt her viewpoint on Phelan, up to the point when she secretly visits Anna in person to question her about his activities; Phelan moves out of the house to stay with Billy after learning about this from Eileen. As the trial continues, with Anna's longtime friend Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and Tim each giving their statements on her behalf, Eileen ends up uncovering CCTV footage of Gary and Tim accosting Seb in the taxi ‚Äî causing her to believe that they coerced him in conspiring with Anna against her husband by retracting his story; she promptly delivers the evidence to court, thus destroying Seb's testimony and reconciling with Phelan. When Anna is called up to proclaim her innocence, she openly describes Phelan as the \\"monster\\" he truly is by disclosing her ordeal throughout their conflict ‚Äî as well as blurting out what he did to Owen and Michael. Unfortunately, she fails to rebuild her case and Phelan becomes satisfied when Anna is later found guilty by the jury on GBH ‚Äî thanks to Eileen's evidence. Anna, distraught with the verdict, hysterically brands Phelan \\"pure evil\\" as she gets dragged out of court, all the while Phelan takes the opportunity to gloat in front of her family and the rest of the court ‚Äî without Eileen's presence, as she had already left the court once the verdict had been announced; Anna is later sentenced to five years imprisonment off-screen. On the day of Anna's sentencing, Phelan becomes surprised when Nicola turns up at the builder's yard ‚Äî seeking forgiveness for the previous accusations she made against him. Phelan forgives Nicola and the pair seemingly move on from the past, much to Gary's anger. He instantly confronts them in the yard, where Nicola defends Phelan against Gary and requests the latter to move on so they can \\"build bridges\\" in the future. While Phelan is happy to have his daughter back at his side once more, it soon turns out that Nicola is actually using this in a plot to bring him down; she later invites Gary over to her place, where he finds out that Seb has taken refuge there since the trial's aftermath and told Nicola about what Phelan did to Anna and Luke. Initially skeptical, Gary reluctantly agrees to go through with her plan on investigating Phelan's crimes by seeking a job at the Legacy Paper Mill Reach ‚Äî where Phelan has just secured his position as the site project's foreman after beating fellow designer Bill Thornhill (Aneirin Hughes) for the job; Phelan had contacted his associate George to uncover Bill's dodgy dealings, thus ousting Bill from the project in the process. Despite his reluctance, Phelan hesitantly employs Gary at Nicola's request to allow him to personally raise money for his impending child ‚Äî with Nicola further stating that she will benefit for the child's upcoming future. However, he takes delight in tormenting Gary once more and later provokes him in the Rovers; with Phelan taunting Gary over the recent grooming of Sarah's daughter Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) back in 2017, and Tim being forced to separate Gary when he snaps and lunges at Phelan in response to this. Gary soon manages to build some progress on Phelan when his boss Mona Beattie (Rachel Logan) announces that the mill's lake is scheduled to be drained ‚Äî leaving Phelan worried that Andy and Vinny's corpses will be found out. In February 2018, Phelan begins to intercept Gary's campaign when he catches Faye visiting Nicola's flat; with Faye having received directions from Eileen's fellow co-worker: Liz's son Steve (Simon Gregson). There, he follows Faye into the flat and disbelieves her claims that she is seeking Nicola's help with school bullying caused by her mother's imprisonment. Nicola, determined to prevent Phelan from finding Seb, feigns illness and he rushes her to the hospital ‚Äî where the pair learn that Nicola will be producing a baby boy. Phelan is delighted with the fact of becoming a granddad to Nicola's child but continues to grow suspicions when he spots someone inside her flat shortly after dropping his daughter off. This prompts Phelan to slash Nicola's keys to her apartment, where he infiltrates the building and finds Seb lounging around in her flat. Phelan proceeds to fire Gary from the mill site job, shortly before the pair are rushed over to hospital when Nicola collapses from her baby's kicking ‚Äî though not while managing to make amends with Sarah after the discovery of her one-night stand with Gary. Though relieved that both Nicola and her unborn child are unharmed, Phelan confronts his daughter over her conspiracy and is devastated when she admits to believing Seb over his theory about Luke. Heartbroken at her daughter's betrayal, Phelan disowns Nicola before storming out in tears. He later explains the situation to Eileen and, telling her that she is the only person he trusts to \\"keep him going\\", states that Nicola can \\"go to hell\\" along with Gary and Seb. Phelan manages to cope with Nicola's betrayal by supporting Eileen when they learn that Todd has been arrested for assaulting a policeman during an attempt to flee Weatherfield with his adopted daughter, Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman), on Christmas Eve 2017. The couple subsequently take Summer to live with them when Billy becomes addicted to heroin, after reacquainting with his junkie brother Lee (Richard Crehan), in his desperate bid to subsist himself with the previous death of Ken's late daughter: Susan, who died from a road collision ‚Äî which Billy has indirectly caused ‚Äî back in February 2001. After rescuing Summer from being abducted by a stalking pedophile at her school, Phelan supports her when she confines to him about feeling responsible for the situation Eileen and Todd have been put through over Billy's ongoing troubles ‚Äî including an incident with Susan's twin sister Peter (Chris Gascoyne) on Christmas Day 2017, which ended with the vicar getting injured and ending up being virtually paralyzed as a result. When Summer's homophobic grandmother Geraldine (Lynne Verrall) turns up at the house to regain custody of her granddaughter, Eileen stands up to her in Billy and Todd's honor before chucking Geraldine out of the house ‚Äî much to Summer's relief and gratefulness; Summer later thanks the couple for their help in dealing with Geraldine, much to Phelan's gratification. Following Anna's imprisonment, Phelan begins to turn Eileen against her friends in order to continue retaining their marriage with his wife's eternal trust over him ‚Äî which starts to diminish her friendships with Liz and Tim in the process. On both occasions, he enrolls a conflict with Liz and Tim respectively; with Liz becoming offended after Phelan impolitely rejects her idea of talking Eileen for a holiday in Barcelona, while Tim grows resentful towards Phelan for his treatment on Anna and even contemplates leaving Weatherfield with Faye as their quarrel begins to deteriorate Tim's marriage to Sally. Upon realizing this, Eileen organizes a house party for Phelan and invites most of her friends to \\"know his character\\" ‚Äî with Liz's fellow friend Moira Pollock (Louiza Patikas) and Tim's sister-in-law Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde) being amongst the attendees. However, she is left disappointed when her husband doesn't show up at the event; it turns out that Phelan's party is on the same day that the mill project's lake will be drained, prompting him to make a desperate attempt in relocating Andy and Vinny someplace else. As Phelan works in cementing their corpses that night, his phone drops in the cement and he ends up falling himself whilst attempting to retrieve it. Phelan is left virtually unconscious but is saved when Eileen discovers him and phones an ambulance ‚Äî with Tim's reluctant help. The following day, Phelan goes over to meet Tim in his taxi with a thank you card in gratitude for helping Eileen with the rescue. Tim nonetheless rejects his card and instead begins to call out Phelan on his nefarious activities. Though he denies causing the deaths of Michael and Luke, as well as Anna's wrongful conviction, Phelan gleefully reveals the truth about \\"Calcutta Street\\" ‚Äî admitting that the project was indeed a scam and that he had been ripping the residents off in the first place. Phelan then leaves the taxi and heads back home, unaware that Tim had actually been recording his confession to Eileen as she listened through ‚Äî causing her to finally learn the truth about \\"Calcutta Street\\". She instantly confronts Phelan for using Jason's inheritance to rip off her neighbors and getting Todd involved in the scam, further concluding that Michael and Anna had been telling the truth about Phelan regarding the \\"Calcutta Street\\" incident all along; Phelan is unable to victimize himself behind the crime, even when he points out that Vinny had ripped them off afterwards. Eileen later contemplates on reporting her husband to the police, but changes her mind at the last second when Phelan manages to win her over again by helping her out with Summer's ongoing situation with Billy; when the vicar's growing addiction leads him to steal Eileen's money and get Summer into trouble at school, a result which strains her friendships with Ken's grandchildren Amy (Elle Mulvaney) and Simon (Alex Bain) in the process, Phelan confronts Billy and coerces to go to rehabilitate his addiction by physically attacking him ‚Äî before threatening to \\"come for him\\" should he \\"fail\\" Eileen once more. Towards the end of March 2018, Phelan stages a getaway plan to escape Weatherfield ‚Äî knowing that Tim's recording evidence of his scam confession could potentially expose his other crimes as well. He forges a holiday trip with Eileen for the coming Easter and she agrees after Phelan tricks Summer in persuading his wife to go ahead with his plans, as Eileen had initially become uninterested with the idea; the couple leave Weatherfield for the holiday after dropping Summer off for a sleepover with local shopkeeper Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) and his children, Aadi (Zennon Ditchett) and Asha (Tanisha Gorey), at their house. As Phelan puts his escape plan into motion, Gary and Seb seek out the gun that he used to kill Luke near the site manager's office. In doing so, however, they end up unearthing the bodies of Andy and Vinny's instead; Gary and Seb are formally arrested for the murders, but are quickly proven innocent when they learn about the bodies and explain the situation to their lawyer: Ken's grandson Adam (Sam Robertson) ‚Äî who subsequently phones Tim about this. Tim promptly calls Eileen to warn her about the bodies at Phelan's worksite, exposing his murderous crimes in front of everyone at The Rovers in the process; Peter, who had been hosting a party to celebrate becoming the pub's new landlord with help from both his girlfriend Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) and her stepsister Leanne (Jane Danson), calls off the party in response to Tim's phone call; while Steve disrupts his mother's date with his old school teacher, Mike Thornberry (Louis Emerick), to inform Liz of the revelation and Eileen's endangerment. At the same time, Phelan learns of the bodies' discovery and plans to leave the country on a boat ‚Äî becoming distant from Eileen in the process. They soon row when Eileen catches Phelan on the boat and becomes angry as to why he needs some privacy from her during their holiday, culminating with Eileen hurting her foot and Phelan halting his escape plan to aid his wife. Phelan later phones a taxi for Eileen to return to Weatherfield, as she couldn't drive back home after losing his van keys from the ensuing argument. They bid goodbye to each and start to go their separate ways until Phelan realizing that Eileen has the boat keys and heads back to find her listening to Tim's voice message ‚Äî thus confirming everyone's theory about him. When she confronts her husband about the bodies that he buried at the worksite, Phelan ‚Äî realizing that he has been exposed at last ‚Äî chucks his wife's phone into the river and proceeds to enumerate the four deaths that he caused; Eileen becomes horrified to learn that not only is her husband indeed responsible for the deaths of Michael and Luke, but that Phelan also kept Andy as his prisoner in their would-be new home and ended up forcing him to kill Vinny before murdering Andy himself. After confessing to his killings, Phelan protests his wife's claims that he is incapable of love and insistently tells Eileen that he really does love her ‚Äî recalling how they ended up becoming a potential family together as their relationship went on ‚Äî with Phelan further stating that he once saved her and Todd when Vinny had planned to kill them during the \\"Calcutta Street\\" incident, before going on to explain how they convinced Nicola to keep her baby for its eventual birth. Outraged at the full extent of his crimes and the fact that Anna had been right about him all along, Eileen furiously brands Phelan a \\"murderer\\" and \\"rapist\\" before going on to berate him for destroying the lives of Todd and Anna. When she threatens to drop his getaway keys into the water, Phelan snaps and charges at her ‚Äî only to end up falling over the edge. However, he manages to hang onto a rope and desperately begs Eileen for help as he struggles to make it up to safety ‚Äî going as far as to claim that he knows where Todd is and, professing that he is in danger, would die if she doesn't help him up. This ultimately proves to be the last straw for Eileen, who responds by angrily stamping on her husband's fingers whilst repeatedly calling him a \\"liar\\"; Phelan eventually loses his grip and ends up falling into the rough sea below. Shortly afterwards, Eileen is safety recovered by Tim and Liz before the arriving police start searching for Phelan's body ‚Äî with Phelan being presumed dead following his showdown with Eileen. At the start of April 2018, Phelan's crimes are finally exposed when the police descend onto Weatherfield and interview most of the residents about his killings; with Gail learning the truth about Michael; while Tim informs Alya and her family that Phelan murdered Luke. By the time the bodies of Andy and Vinny have been revealed and subsequently identified, their fates end up becoming public knowledge as well ‚Äî with Daniel telling Flora about Vinny when she finds out about his death, while Robert organizes a funeral for Andy upon hearing what Phelan had done to him. Meanwhile, Eileen spends a night at the police station when she gets arrested for abetting her husband in his criminal activities and is later interrogated by chef inspector DS Keith Willetts (James Quinn) about her knowledge of Phelan's crimes ‚Äî more specifically about the \\"Calcutta Street\\" scam and Andy's captivity. She is eventually released without charge, thanks to the assistance of her lawyer and Yasmeen's grandson-in-law Imran Habeeb (Charlie de Melo), but quickly finds herself Weatherfield's public enemy ‚Äî as several residents, specifically Alya and Faye, confront Eileen over her ignorance towards Phelan's nature. Despite this, Tim and Li thoroughly support Eileen over her ordeal with Phelan; while both Nicola and Seb become friends with her again; and Gail ‚Äî who was formerly Eileen's nemesis ‚Äî comforts her over the fact that she herself had previously endured the same experienced with her deceased killer husband, Richard Hillman (Brian Capron). However, as Eileen begins to slowly recover from her recent trauma and move on ahead with her own life, she is left unaware that Phelan has actually survived the fall and is nursing his way back to health at Mrs. Gillen's (Janie Booth) bedsit in Ireland ‚Äî with Phelan having checked in under the alias on his false passport, \\"Alan Frost\\". Towards the end of the month, Phelan learns that Eileen and Nicola are involved in the \\"Free Anna Windass Campaign\\" ‚Äî also known as \\"F.A.W.N.\\" ‚Äî that Daniel has organized to secure Anna's release. After he watches the pair join Anna's children and Seb in speaking out for her release, Phelan checks out of the hotel and plans his return to settle old scores. In May 2018, Phelan takes refugee at a caravan park in Abergele ‚Äî where he uses a false identity on a mother's social group to keep in contact with an oblivious Nicola. Towards the end of the month, Gary becomes suspicious with her mysterious contact and quickly finds out that it was Phelan after tracking his location in Wales ‚Äî with help from his army friend, Joe Haslam (Chord Melodic). Intending to finish him for good, Gary attacks Phelan with a bat; however, he is quickly subdued and is on the verge of getting killed when Joe intervenes, knocking out Phelan with a rock. The pair brought Phelan back to Weatherfield and held him captive in the builder's yard, where Gary had planned to get revenge on him for what he did to his family. As Joe left Gary to proceed with his plan, however, Sarah confronted him and ended up discovering Phelan's captivity. As Sarah argued with Gary when he refuses to get the police involved about his return, Phelan is discovered by Kevin's young son Jack (Kyran Bowes) ‚Äî whom he previously helped rescue Anna back on New Year's Day 2017 ‚Äî and he attempts to bribe the youngster with a tender into setting him free. Jack nearly takes Phelan's bait until Gary and Sarah arrived back in the room; the couple manage to talk Jack out of freeing Phelan before sending him away, with the promise that he never saw Phelan. Once Jack has gone, Phelan taunts Gary with constant remarks about his mother that caused the latter to brutally hit his enemy with a plank of wood. When Sarah once again tries to convince Gary into calling the police, Phelan manages to free himself ‚Äî thanks to Jack's earlier help ‚Äî and attacks Gary with a chair. He then locked the builder's yard gate, retrieved his firearm, and forced the couple back into the garage. Holding them at gunpoint, Phelan orders Sarah to contact Nicola with Gary's phone and request that she come to the yard. Sarah instead calls Tim, not knowing that she is actually speaking to Kevin on the phone, to trick Phelan into thinking that she called Nicola; however, Phelan deduces this when Nicola doesn't turn up and he forces Gary to relinquish the code access on his phone ‚Äî threatening to harm Sarah otherwise. After firing his unloaded gun at Sarah when she confirms his suspicions out of fear, Phelan locks her and Gary in the yard. He then makes his way discreetly over to Eileen's house, where she and Seb are looking after Nicola and Zac ‚Äî who was merely born just moments ago. After tricking Nicola into telling him in, Phelan forces his way into the house where he meets Zac and spitefully tells Eileen that their \\"marriage\\" meant nothing ‚Äî stating that it was all part of his original plan to cover-up his crimes. When Nicola attempts to prevent her father from coming near Zac, he threatens to shoot her. However, Seb secretly comes down the stairs and attacks Phelan with a screwdriver. Despite the efforts of the three attempting to subdue Phelan, he overpowers them ‚Äî knocking out Eileen and Seb, but unintentionally shooting Nicola in the process. Feeling guilty for shooting his own daughter, Phelan storms into the bistro ‚Äî interrupting Robert's wedding to his co-partner, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) ‚Äî with Nicola in his arms, begging for help. He instigates a siege and holds the couple along with their wedding guests, including Roy and Daniel, at gunpoint; amongst the hostages include Roy's friend Mary Taylor (Patti Clare), Daniel's girlfriend Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn), Jenny and her stepdaughter Kate (Faye Brookers), Zeedan's ex-wife Rana (Bhavna Limbachia), and Michelle's two sons Ali Neeson (James Burrows) and Ryan (Ryan Prescott) as well as her two sister-in-laws Maria (Samia Longchambon) and Carla (Alison King) ‚Äî the latter of whom Phelan had previously helped save on the night he returned to Weatherfield back in January 2016, two years ago. At first, Phelan refuses to let the guests call an ambulance, and instead orders Roy to confiscate everyone's phones before telling Ali ‚Äî a trainee general practitioner ‚Äî to save Nicola under the threat of shooting his mother. However, as the sirens emerge onto the Bistro outside, Phelan relents and agrees to an ambulance for Nicola ‚Äî whom he then apologizes to for everything he has put her through and solemnly gives her a goodbye kiss. After making Ali promise to save Nicola, with Maria and Rana stepping in to help out as well, Phelan requests for a hostage and insists on taking Michelle ‚Äî despite both Carla and Roy's offer to be taken captive themselves. Robert pleads with Phelan being taken captive instead, but Phelan refuses and threatens to kill the wedded couple after cloaking his gun; Michelle quickly relents in her soon to be husband's defense, and Phelan forces Robert and the others into a corner under the threat of shooting his bride-to-be should anyone follow them. Phelan drags Michelle into the kitchen and is on the verge of escaping when he turns to find Anna waiting for him; Daniel's campaign had been successful, leading to Anna being released since then, and she had secretly returned to Weatherfield after Gary had informed her of Phelan's comeback ‚Äî which led to the kidnapping that Gary carried out at his mother's original plan to get Phelan to admit his wrongdoings before taking him to the police, only for Sarah's earlier interference to bring these events up to the Bistro siege as a result. With Phelan surprised to come face-to-face with Anna once again, Michelle uses this opportunity to manage herself in escaping his grasp; however, Phelan shoves Michelle away and shoots her in response. Anna then charges at Phelan with a knife and, just as he turns to shoot her, quickly stabs him in the chest ‚Äî finally stopping Phelan as he drops his gun and slumps onto the floor in pain. Robert thereupon bursts into the kitchen with Ali and Carla, before all three promptly rush over to Michelle for medical treatment. At that moment, Phelan pulls the knife from his chest ‚Äî ignoring Ali's objections ‚Äî in a last-ditch effort to get one over Anna by implicating her for his murder, despite knowing that he is going to die as a result. However, Michelle defends Anna upon saying the attack was self-defence and that she'll be willing to take the risk for her ‚Äî as well as for Luke and Andy in retaliation for their murders. Anna then approaches her dying tormentor and, taunting Phelan over the fact that people like him don't get the victory, in the end, tells him that Zac will never remember his existence. After declaring that she won the longstanding conflict between them, Anna watches as Phelan does a light chuckle with his last breath ‚Äî indicating, in his theory, that nobody has won in this scenario ‚Äî before he succumbs to his stabbing and dies in front of her. Shortly afterwards, Michelle and Nicola are rushed to hospital ‚Äî where the pair would end up recovering from their gunshot wounds ‚Äî while Anna, after freeing Gary and Sarah from Phelan's captivity, meets Zac for the first time whilst reuniting with her family. She then informs Eileen of her husband's death, which is publicly rumored to be a suicide thanks to Anna and Michelle's cover-up, and the pair make amends with each other before resolving to move on from Phelan together; Anna, however, makes a decision to leave Weatherfield so she can move on from her past. A deceased Phelan is last seen when the residents of Coronation Street observe as his body is brought out and put in the private ambulance, signalling the end of his reign of terror once and for all.

Debuting as a member of the Hokkaido rock band Galileo Galilei in 2009, he left to form a new musical unit, Folks.  Biography  Iwai was born in Eniwa, Hokkaido in 1990. In junior high school, he and his friends formed a band called Guild in 2007. The group performed at rock events in Sapporo from 2007 onwards, and self-produced an extended play, , in August 2008, followed by a self-released single called in February 2009. The band entered the School of Lock! national teenage rock contest, Senk≈ç Riot, in 2008, and performed at the round three Sapporo semi-finals. The band did not make it to the national finals, but met the semi-final winner, Galileo Galilei. In 2009 after Folks went on hiatus, Galileo Galilei vocalist Yuuki Ozaki told Iwai to come to Wakkanai, Hokkaido, where Galileo Galilei members were going to high school, as their guitarist, S≈çhei Funaya, had left. Iwai accepted, and lived at the house of band's bassist, Hitoshi Sak≈ç. Iwai joined the band on August 31, 2009 as a support member. Galileo Galilei made their major debut with SME Records in 2010, moving to Tokyo. Their debut full-length album, Parade, reached number five on Oricon's album charts. In March 2011, the band relocated to Sapporo, and the bandmates started living together, calling their home Galileo House. In Galileo Galilei, Ozaki was the main lyricist songwriter, and would give ideas to Iwai and other band members to work on further. Iwai did not feel confident in his ideas and lyrics, however wrote the music for their 2011 single \\"Asu e\\", and worked on many of the songs on Portal (2012), including most of the work on the instrumental song \\"Blue River Side Alone\\". Iwai started to feel like he wanted to influence the Japanese music scene more by himself, and in July 2012, during the demo sessions for Baby, It's Cold Outside, told Ozaki that he wanted to be the front man of his own band. On September 13, 2012, it was officially announced that Iwai would leave the band with fellow member Kazumasa Noguchi, so that Iwai could challenge himself with something new musically. In 2012, Iwai and Noguchi returned to Hokkaido to set up their own band, and asked former Guild member Yoshitomo Kobayashi to join. They moved to Sapporo to further their music career, and rented a house with Iwai's older brother Katsutoshi Iwai. Iwai and Masatsugu Takahashi had a separate band at the same time, and after realising that both groups would work well together, the two bands merged in January 2013, forming Folks and basing themselves at the Iwai household in Megumino. The group released their first extended play, Take Off, digitally on March 29, 2013, and made their major label debut under Ki/oon Music in 2014 with the extended play Newtown.

It was announced on September 4, 2014 at Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin and released in October 2014. It is a successor to the 2012 Nokia Lumia 820 and marketed as an \\"affordable flagship\\".  Hardware  The Lumia 830 has a metal frame with a removable polycarbonate back. It is available in multiple colours - white, orange, green and black. = Internals = The Lumia 830 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8926 SoC with a 1.2 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and a Qualcomm Adreno 305 GPU. There is 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage; the latter can be expanded with MicroSD cards up to 128 GB in size. = Display = The Lumia 830 has a IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280x720 and an aspect ratio of 16:9. The display features Nokia's ClearBlack polarisation filters and is protected by curved Gorilla Glass 3. = Camera = The Lumia 830 has a 10 MP PureView-branded rear camera, sporting a 1/3.4-inch BSI sensor with 1.12 Œºm pixels, and an optically stabilised Carl Zeiss 6-element lens with an f/2.2 aperture. The camera supports 1080p video capture and is complemented by an LED flash and a two-stage shutter button. The front camera has a 0.9 MP sensor with a wide-angle f/2.4 lens, and supports 720p video recording. = Connectivity = The Lumia 830 supports 4G LTE technology with maximum transfer speeds of 150 Mbit/s. Other wireless connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi hotspot, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, and wireless screen projection via Miracast. Physical connectors include a Micro-USB 2.0 connector for charging and data transfer, as well as a 3.5 mm audio jack. = Other = The Lumia 830 supports wireless inductive charging using the Qi standard. The AT&T; version additionally supports the PMA standard. The Lumia 830 includes a variety of sensors, including proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as Microsoft's Motion Data activity tracker based on Qualcomm's SensorCore technology. Due to chipset limitations, however, it does not support passive voice activation for the Cortana digital assistant.  Software  The Lumia 830 ships with Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 operating system coupled with the Lumia Denim firmware update. The new Lumia Camera app in the Denim firmware update adds support for Rich Capture (HDR imaging), DNG capture and Moment Capture (high- quality 2 MP stills extraction from 1080p video). The Lumia 830 can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile.  Reception  The Lumia 830 has received mixed to positive reviews. Most critics commended the design, build quality and camera performance, as well as the availability of several high-end features at a mid-range price. On the other hand, many reviewers found fault with the chipset performance, display resolution and the overall Windows Phone app ecosystem (as compared to Android and iOS). Several reviews drew attention to the fact that the Lumia 830 would be the last Nokia-branded smartphone, with future models carrying the Microsoft Mobile brand instead. Engadget gave the Lumia 830 a rating of 80/100, calling the rear camera \\"impressive\\" and praising the premium design and solid battery life, while criticising performance in graphics-intensive games and gaps in the app ecosystem, particularly for Google's services. Editor Philip Palermo concluded the review writing: \\"... in general, life was rather pleasant with the 830. It's an Icon(ic) phone that cuts most of the right corners.\\" Lee Bell of The Inquirer described the Lumia 830 as offering many of the same features as the higher- end Lumia 930 while being more compact, commended the availability of multiple colours and called the display \\"the most impressive we've seen on a Nokia Lumia device\\". A later review by Alastair Stevenson praised the impressive camera, as well as the enterprise and productivity features, while criticising the performance of Internet Explorer and the lack of \\"many apps that certain users will rely on for personal use\\". Brett Howse of AnandTech called the Lumia 830 \\"one of the best Nokia phones launched [in 2014]\\", praising the design and ergonomics, but finding that the performance does not measure up to the \\"affordable flagship\\" moniker. The review concluded with: \\"The combination of the metal band, a thin chassis, a light weight, a decent display, and a decent camera make for a phone that is very good for the right price\\", but also noted that the phone costs more than it should in many regions. Ivan Petkov of GSMArena.com highlighted the phone's design and build quality as positives, and found no major problems with performance, saying that the operating system runs \\"buttery smooth, without any lags whatsoever\\". New features added in Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 and the Lumia Denim firmware update were also praised, while the main downside was seen to be the availability of mid-range Android phones that offer comparable or better specifications for the same or lower price. Andy Vandervell of Trusted Reviews gave the Lumia 830 a score of 8/10, saying it compares favourably to the higher-end Lumia 930 in terms of design, and praising the camera's low-light capabilities. Poor performance in certain games was once again pointed out as a weakness, and the phone was said to be \\"useless as an in-car sat nav\\" due to the placement of the buttons and Micro-USB connector. Nic Healey of CNET gave the phone a favourable review, listing the camera, design and overall value as positives and saying that \\"the Lumia 830 does its dynasty proud\\". The main criticisms were against the 720p display and the appeal, or lack thereof, of the Windows Phone ecosystem. Business Insider UK ranked the Lumia 830 as 15th in their best smartphones list.

It was originally built for members of the Barbier family (later titled as Marquis de Kerjean) between the 1540s and 1590s. The chateau was damaged in the 1790s during the French Revolution, and fell into further disrepair during the 19th century. The building was taken into state care in 1911 and restored in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Standing in a 20-hectare park, the house, park and some out-lying structures (including a large dovecote) are open to the public. History Finist√®re was a thriving agricultural area in the 16th century, and the Barbier family built a fortified house on their estate lands close to Saint-Vougay. The building followed contemporary fashions and included elements of Renaissance architecture of the house itself, with a slightly less common bastioned and casemated external defensive wall. The manor house was the hub of an active agricultural estate for several centuries, before becoming somewhat neglected during the 17th century. Following a marriage between the Barbier and Coatanscour families, the estate and house experienced some growth in the 18th century. However, during the French Revolution, the Marquise de Coatanscour was arrested, imprisoned and guillotined in Brest, and the estate and chateau forfeited to the republic. Serving as a military garrison after the Revolution, during which time the building fell into significant disrepair, the house was sold to the Brilhac family in 1802. Several damaged sections of the house were further dismantled in this period ‚Äì with lead and stone sold as building material ‚Äì before the Forsanz-Coatgoureden family took control. In 1911 the French state bought the chateau, classified the site as a historic monument, and from the 1980s to the early 2000s restored the house and surrounds.

Its initial role was to defend Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields in East Anglia. Later it commanded part of the searchlight belt protecting The Midlands. In 1944 the brigade was moved south to protect the embarkation ports for Operation Overlord and to defend against V-1 flying bombs in Operation Diver. It was briefly reformed in the postwar TA. Origin The brigade was formed on 28 September 1938 at Boston Lodge, South Ealing in West London, under the command of Brigadier O.W. Nicholson (Territorial Army). It was part of 2nd AA Division, with the following searchlight units under command:Frederick, pp. 1050‚Äì1.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LVIII, p. 376.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. * 33rd (St Pancras) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers (RE) ‚Äì formed in 1935 from the 19th London Regiment (St Pancras)Litchfield, p. 171.19th London at Regiments.org ** 332, 333 & 334 AA Companies, RE * 36th (Middlesex) AA Bn, RE ‚Äì formed in 1936Litchfield, p. 178. ** 317, 345, 346, 424 AA Companies, RE * 58th (Middlesex) AA Bn, RE ‚Äì formed in 1938 as a duplicate of 36th Bn ** 344, 425, 426 AA Companies, RE * 9th Bn Middlesex Regiment (60th Searchlight Regiment) ‚Äì infantry battalion converted in 1938Litchfield, p. 179.9th Middlesex at Regiment.org ** 429, 439, 431 Companies * 10th (3rd City of London) Bn Royal Fusiliers (69th Searchlight Regiment) ‚Äì infantry battalion converted in 1938Litchfield, p. 174.3rd City of London at regiment.org ** 456, 457, 458 Companies * 40 AA Brigade Company Royal Army Service Corps Although the brigade's units were all from London and Middlesex, its war station was at RAF Duxford, with the searchlight detachments defending RAF stations across East Anglia. Mobilisation 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth While the brigade was forming the TA's AA units had been mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. Battle of Britain and Blitz 40 AA Brigade largely operated as a 'light' AA brigade composed of searchlight (S/L) and light AA gun (LAA) units. By the summer of 1940, all searchlight regiments had been transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA). As more LAA units became available, they were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as factories and airfields. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of , but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to .Routledge, pp. 388-9. After the intense period of activity against airfields during the Battle of Britain, the German Luftwaffe switched to night raids against London and other cities (The Blitz). In November 1940 the S/L layout was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or RAF Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with searchlight control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, p. 393. =Order of Battle 1940‚Äì41= By the time the Blitz ended in May 1941, 40 AA Bde's composition was as follows:2 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45.

In the Summer of 1941 AA Command began to receive purpose-built SLC radar in sufficient numbers to allow some S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites. These were redeployed into 'Indicator Belts' of radar-controlled S/L clusters covering approaches to the RAF's night-fighter sectors, repeated by similar belts covering AA Command's Gun Defence Areas (GDAs). Inside each belt was a 20-mile deep 'Killer Belt' of single S/Ls spaced at intervals in a 'Killer Belt' cooperating with night- fighters patrolling defined 'boxes'. The pattern was designed to ensure that raids penetrating deeply towards the Midlands GDAs would cross more than one belt, and the GDAs had more S/Ls at close spacing. The number of LAA units to protect Vital Points such as airfields was growing, albeit slowly.Routledge, p. 99.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì404. At this stage of the war, experienced units were being posted away to train for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer LAA units to counter the Luftwaffe 's hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns that began in March 1942. By May 1942 the brigade only had two units under command (36th and 64th S/L Rgts), but newly-formed units continued to join AA Command, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them.Collier, Chapter XX. =Order of Battle 1941‚Äì43= During this period the brigade's composition was as follows (temporary attachments omitted):Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84.

During the summer of 1943, the last of 40 AA Bde's units were transferred away. In November the brigade HQ was given a complete new roster of AA gun units to command, and in January 1944 it was transferred to 2 AA Group. This formation in Southern and South-Eastern England was responsible for defending the assembly camps, depots and embarkation ports for the forthcoming Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). In November 1943 it was also ordered to plan for the expected onslaught of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers') against London, to which it responded by planning a thick belt of 8-gun HAA positions across the likely flight path, backed by LAA guns. Meanwhile, 2 AA Group had to deal with a sharp increase in Luftwaffe air raids trying to reach London during the winter of 1943‚Äì4 (the so-called 'Little Blitz').Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì10. =Order of Battle 1943‚Äì44= AA Command formation sign worn after 1942.

The first V-1 missiles were fired against London in June, a week after D-Day, and Operation Diver was activated. 2 AA Group's HAA batteries left their 'Overlord' sites and moved to pre-planned sites across the 'funnel' of V-1 flightpaths. 40 AA Brigade was one of four reinforcing brigades moved into the area within two weeks. However, the results were disappointing, and after a fortnight AA Command changed its tactics. Firstly, mobile HAA guns were replaced with static installations that could traverse more quickly to track the fast-moving targets. These were emplaced on temporary 'Pile platforms' named after the Commander-in-Chief of AA Command, Gen Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile. Secondly, the HAA gun belt was moved to the coast and interlaced with LAA guns to hit the missiles out to sea. This new belt was divided into six brigade sectors, with 40 AA Bde HQ taking charge of one. The whole process involved the movement of hundreds of guns and vehicles and thousands of servicemen and women, but a new 8-gun site could be established in 48 hours. The guns were constantly in action, and the success rate against the 'Divers' steadily improved, until over 50 per cent of incoming missiles were destroyed by gunfire or fighter aircraft.

A new phase of the V-1 offensive began in the second half of September 1944 when the Luftwaffe began launching V-1s from aircraft flying over the North Sea. Once again, AA Command had to redeploy its guns. In October, 40 AA Bde was transferred to 1 AA Group, which controlled the 'Diver Box' defences over the outer Thames Estuary, and divided the coastline from Chatham, Kent, to Great Yarmouth into 10 sectors, each under a brigade HQ. This time the wholesale movement of guns, platforms, personnel and huts fell into chaos as the staff work of the AA groups and brigades fell apart, earning a stinging rebuke from Gen Pile. The responsibilities proved too large for one group HQ, and a new 9 AA Group was formed to take command of the Diver defences on the coast of East Anglia, including 40 AA Bde.Routledge, pp. 416‚Äì7. =Order of Battle 1944‚Äì45= Static 3.7-inch gun of 127th HAA Rgt on a Pile Platform at Southwold, Essex, 9 October 1944.

War's end As the war in Europe drew to its end in early 1945, 9 AA Group was disbanded, and 40 AA Bde reverted to the command of 2 AA Group. demobilisation of AA Command proceeded rapidly as manpower was diverted to other roles. After VE day 40 AA Bde was reduced to commanding two of its former units (128th and 136th HAA Rgts), together with 2nd HAA Rgt, a Regular Army unit returned from Middle East Forces.Joslen, p. 484‚Äì5.Routledge, pp. 418‚Äì21. By September 1945, 40 AA Bde HQ reported directly to AA Command and commanded two 'Area AA Maintenance HQs' (4 and 14), and an ordnance depot at Kincardine in Scotland. It was then rejoined in October and November by 128th and 136th HAA Rgts, and by 14th (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt. In April 1946, these regiments were disbandedLitchfield, p. 299. and replaced in 40 AA Bde by the reformed 3rd and 5th HAA Rgts, which were Regular Army units that had been lost at the fall of Singapore and Hong Kong respectively in 1941‚Äì42.Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86.Joslen, pp. 557, 559.

Pritchard helped save approximately 150 Dutch Jews, most of them children, throughout the German occupation of the Netherlands. In addition to protecting these peoples lives, she was imprisoned by Nazis, worked in collaboration with the Dutch resistance, and shot dead a known Dutch informer to the Nazis to save Dutch Jewish children. Early life Pritchard was born Marion Philippina van Binsbergen on 7 November 1920 in Amsterdam and grew up in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of liberal judge Jacob van Binsbergen, who was on the board of regents for the prisons of Amsterdam. Her parents encouraged her to express her feelings and to expect honest answers from them. She recalled going to school with Jews in every class and reported that they were \\"considered Dutch like everyone else\\". At age 19, she enrolled in a school for social work in Amsterdam. German occupation of the Netherlands The German Army invaded and occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. During her social work studies, Pritchard (then van Binsbergen) was arrested while staying overnight during curfew with friends, who‚Äîunbeknownst to her‚Äîhad been distributing transcripts of Allied radio broadcasts, and was imprisoned for seven months. In the spring of 1942, Pritchard witnessed a round-up of Jewish children's home occupants, including babies and eight-year-olds, being picked up by their limbs or hair and thrown into trucks to be taken away by Nazis, along with two women who tried to intervene. The two other women attacked the soldiers and were also taken away in a truck. She described her reaction to witnessing this event: \\"I was shocked and in tears, and after that I knew my rescue work was more important than anything else I might be doing\\". Pritchard first began her work as part of the Dutch underground, bringing food, clothing and papers to those in hiding from the Nazis. As part of her rescue plan, Pritchard registered Jewish infants as her own children and then placed them in safe, non-Jewish homes. She secured false identification papers and ration cards for Jewish adults. She then took on more dangerous activities when she was tasked with delivering a package to a home in the northern part of the country. Along the journey, she was given a baby girl by a stranger. Upon reaching her destination, she found out that the people she was supposed to deliver the package to had been arrested. She then took shelter with a man and his wife, originally not part of the operation, who agreed to take care of her and the baby. Her most-noted rescue occurred in late 1942 when she sheltered Fred Polak and his three children in the servants' quarters of a friend's villa in Huizen, outside Amsterdam. There the Polaks established a rapid process for hiding from the German inspections of the premises, which worked until in 1944 a Dutch collaborator, who had learned to return to hiding places in hopes of discovering Jews emerging from hiding after a half-hour interval, discovered the family. Pritchard saw no recourse, but to reach for a revolver and shoot the man. He was secreted to a funeral home and buried in the same coffin with another person without his fate being discovered by the authorities. She never discussed her activities with her parents or younger brother, lest they be endangered. Postwar life After the war, Pritchard worked for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Germany at displaced-persons camps. Consequently, she met and married Anton \\"Tony\\" Pritchard, the head of such a camp in Bavaria and a recently discharged United States Army officer. The Pritchards then moved to the United States in 1947 and settled in Waccabuc, New York, where she worked as a child social worker, aiding refugee families. The Pritchards had three sons, Arnold, Ivor and Brian. In 1976, she and her husband moved to Vershire, Vermont and she commenced her studies to become a psychoanalyst at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis. She then practiced as a psychoanalyst. Pritchard died at age 96 in December 2016 from cerebral arteriosclerosis, survived by her three sons, and their progeny. Recognition Pritchard received the following recognition for her rescue work: * Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 1981 * Wallenberg Medal in 1996 * A 2004 honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Vermont and commemorative book from the university's Center for Holocaust Studies * Medal of Valor at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's annual national tribute dinner in 2009 * Display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum References Category:1920 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Amsterdam Category:The Holocaust in the Netherlands Category:Dutch humanitarians Category:Dutch people of World War II Category:Dutch Righteous Among the Nations Category:Women in World War II Category:Women in European warfare Category:Dutch social workers ","title":"Marion Pritchard"},{"id":"43738316","text":"Mean Spirit is a book about the Osage tribe during the Oklahoma oil boom. It is the first novel by Chickasaw author Linda Hogan. It was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1991. Synopsis The book is set in the 1920s, at a time when rivers of oil were discovered underneath land in Oklahoma that had been purchased by the Osage Tribe after displacement. As a result of mineral leases, Grace Blanket became the wealthiest individual in the territory. She is murdered by unknown suspects. The Graycloud family takes over the care of her daughter and heir Nola Blanket. One-by-one, members of the Graycloud family suffer suspicious deaths, and no-one knew why. Local authorities show no interest in Native deaths. Letters begging for help to Washington DC. Stace Red Hawk, a Native American government official, decides to investigate: he finds intimidation, fraud, and murder and then something else quite by surprise‚Äîthat he had a true love for his people along with their brave past. Theme Mean Spirit's is the recognition that Native Americans culture relies on the survival of the natural world and can easily be corrupted by greed and obsessions to material gains. Plot Mean Spirit is a murder mystery set during an era known as the Osage murders, in Osage Indian Territory in Oklahoma in the 1920s. The Native communities struggle for survival amidst a pool of greed, corruption, and violence when oil is discovered on Osage allotments. The Osage had purchased their land in Oklahoma after displacement. They were forced to divide their land up into individual allotments, with \\"excess\\" land being made available to white settlers. The discovery of oil, although bringing in an era of material wealth also led to Osage women being married by adventurers, all Osage people being put under threat of violence and legal decisions of \\"incompetence,\\" and wholesale profiteering off of the people. The novel begins with the murder of Grace Blanket and the cover-up of what happened. Grace's daughter, Nola, is now in danger because she was a witness and because she inherits all of her mother's oil-rich land. She is forced to move in with her cousins, the Greyclouds, for protection. Nola soon becomes eligible to marry, but marriage is dangerous as White men view marriage to a Native women with oil land as a business investment and deal. As other Osage continue dying under suspicious circumstances, the evidence suggests that rancher turned oilman, John Hale, is behind the murderous actions. No legal actions are taken until Stace Red Hawk, a \\"Lakota Sioux working for the U.S. Bureau of Investigation\\" decides comes to Oklahoma from DC in search of the truth. As the battles between the two worlds mount, Nola and others break away from the greed and start to rediscover their relationship with the land. The novel makes reference to the Osage murders, the land grabs in Oklahoma, the desperate need for the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) as we see that Indian people are denied the right to practice their religious beliefs, and have private ceremonies raided with religious objects being confiscated to go to museums. The murder of Grace Blanket seems especially relevant given the current issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, throughout the Americas, while also resonating with the murder of Anna Mae Aquash (1975), as the most well-known murder case in Indian Country. Hogan portrays multiple views of American Indian religious expression, including the Native American church, sacred fire, the good read road, bat medicine, the character Michael Horse writing a new book of the bible, and even an Catholic priest who thinks he has discovered \\"Native truths\\" that the other characters all already know. Hogan's novel takes a pan- Indian as opposed to a strictly tribal approach to fictionalization of history because, although the Osage murders are the premise of the book, the character development and parallel stories focus on a wider Indian community, which includes mixed-bloods and folks with different tribal ancestry. Osage critic and literary scholar Robert Allen Warrior took great exception to Hogan, a Chickasaw author, for not telling the tale as a strictly Osage story, which he sees as supremely disrespectful to Osage history (citation needed). Reception Mean Spirit was selected by the Literary Guild as being \\"extraordinary...If you take up no other novel this year, or next, this one will suffice to hold, to disturb, to enlighten and to inspire you.\\" Newsday spoke of the book as follows: \\"Early in this century, rivers of oil were found beneath Oklahoma land belonging to Indian people, and beautiful Grace Banket became the richest person in the Territory. But she was murdered by the greed of white men, and the Graycloud family, who cared for her daughter, began dying mysteriously. Letters sent to Washington, D.C. begging for help went unanswered, until at last a Native American government official, Stace Red Hawk, traveled west to investigate. What he found has been documented by history: rampant fraud, intimidation, and murder. But he also found something truly extraordinary--his deepest self and abiding love for his people, and their brave past.\\" It was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1991. Barbara Kingsolver in the LA Times found it \\"relentlessly sad\\" yet full of realistic, complex characters; she praised Hogan: \\"She's created empathy. She carves a vast tragedy down to a size and shape that will fit into a human heart.\\" References =Sources=  Warrior, Robert Allen, and Dennis Mcauliffe.

Eventually, he agreed to purchase the truck for $1,700 provided it first passed a new COF, and he subsequently arranged for the Ministry of Transport Te Awamutu branch to inspect the vehicle. On the first inspection, the MOT only found several minor faults, and when the vehicle was brought back for a second inspection, it was duly issued with a certificate of fitness and a certificate of inspection. Within 2 weeks after purchasing the vehicle, Rutherford discovered the truck had a serious fault, which the two inspections had failed to notice, and after removing the current COF certificate, took it to the Hamilton branch for inspection, where not only did they refused to issue a new COF, but were so concerned with the state of the vehicle, Rutherford had great difficulty in getting the vehicle back to drive home for the repairs. Rutherford sued the MOT, as well as the vendor in the District Court for the $1,083.83 in repairs the truck needed, but was unsuccessful in both claims, as the judge said Rutherford could have inspected the truck himself and discovered the fault. He appealed to the High Court. Held The High Court ruled in favour of Rutherford, as even though the MOT were unlikely to know that the purpose of the inspection was for the purchase of the truck, it was at least a possibility. In overruling the District Court judge's rationale that Rutherford could have mitigated the loss by inspecting the vehicle himself, Cooke J said that Rutherford could have relied on the inspection certificate here due to it having been recently issued at the time of purchase.

Much of the complex has now been destroyed, with only two buildings remaining: the gatehouse, God's House Tower, a grade I listed scheduled ancient monument, and a chapel, St. Julien's Church, a grade I listed building. The hospital was founded in the 12th century by Gervase le Riche, burgess and portreeve of Southampton. History =Foundation= The Hospice, or Hospital of God's House ‚Äì Domus Dei or Maison Dieu ‚Äì was founded in the latter half of the 12th century by Gervase (or Gervaise) le Riche, burgess and portreeve (port warden) of Southampton.Whitlock, p. 16 In the Norman or Mediaeval Latin of that period, he is named Praepositus de Sudhanton. Gervase le Riche had one brother, Roger (possibly a twin), who was the first warden of God's House.Whitlock, p. 18 The reasons for le Riche's decision to found the hospital are not known. John Leland reported that the hospital was founded on the site of the founder's home. As port warden, le Riche would be likely to live near the port; his house would have opened directly onto the harbour, at a time when there was no wall running along Winkle Street from the Water Gate to God's House Gateway. He would step out of his house, through the wicket- gate, at once upon a pier or quay, against which the waters lapped at high tide, and where the official vessel awaited him for embarkation. Behind, and at the side of his house, along the present High Street, and up to Gloucester Square, stretched the garden and orchards. Nearby, at the other side, lay the Bowling Green.Whitlock, p. 21 The resident members of the hospital consisted of a custos or warden, two or more priests, three or more brethren, some ten sisters, three or more poor men and women ‚Äî who were to make themselves generally useful according to their health and strength. Besides these, there were various officials and servants necessary for so large an establishment, such as cook, barber surgeon, laundress, dairymaid, cowherd, shepherd, brewer, and swineherd. There appears to have been a large body of men, partially non- resident, who, acting as under-stewards, managed the various properties of the hospital, and had to give account thereof to the warden. Attached to the establishment also were others, non-resident, living on the various farms and manors, and being unpaid, subsisted on the produce of the land which they tilled.Whitlock, p. 29 The \\"sisters\\" and other females were expected to make themselves useful by nursing the sick, and offering frequent prayers. They received a farthing per day for clothing, and an extra payment for exceptional acts and duties, such as abstaining from meat for a certain period. The \\"brethren\\" were also not allowed to be idle; but, when not required at home, were sent to look after the interests of the establishment at its various tenements and farms, as occasion might require.Whitlock, p. 30 The \\"brethren and sisters\\" were also to receive the travellers, wayfarers, and pilgrims, on their embarkation and debarkation, or on their journey generally, to wait upon them in the refectory, and to tend them, if sick, in the infirmary. Lepers, however, appear to have been excluded from the latter building, as there was a special leper hospital already in existence, founded by the burgesses, and dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, where the Marlands Shopping Centre is now situated. Special directions were laid down for religious acts including amongst others the recitation of the Lord's Prayer by the \\"brethren and sisters\\" 180 times a day. The Bishop of Winchester was initially made patron of the hospital, however patronage subsequently passed to the monarch.Whitlock, p. 31 The pauper portion of the community received, besides their food, one farthing every two days. They were, however, allowed to make additions to this munificent sum by engaging in extra employment. Thus one became a gatekeeper, another helped at harvest time to reap corn, a third assisted at some menial work, and at the end of the year was presented with two pairs of shoes. For the maintenance of the hospital the founder bestowed on it grants of land, farms, manors and messuages which were subsequently supplemented by further bequests made by royal and other donors. Some of these lands lay in the neighbourhood of God's House while other landed property was situated further afield ‚Äî at Stoneham, West End, Botley, also in Portsmouth, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. =Royal grants and protection= Although God's House was founded a few years before the death of Henry II of England, there is no mention of the Hospital or Grevase le Riche in correspondence relating to that king. However, his successor, Richard I granted lands to the Hospital shortly after its foundation. He then subsequently granted land at Gussage in Dorset to the hospital, including not just the farm but the farmer, Turstinus, and \\"all his following\\" (\\"Turstinus et tota sequela sua\\") ‚Äì meaning his family, labourers, stock, agricultural implements, goods, and chattels.Whitlock, p. 32 Richard also took the Hospital under his protection, with the order: King John made a grant of further lands at Gussage to Gervase le Riche, and made a further declaration of protection: In addition to these royal grants and declarations of protection, William de Redvers, the Earl of Devon from 1196‚Äì1216 made a grant of land from \\"Werrore\\" near Carisbrooke to \\"Pukeflunt, Northwde, Medina, and Tintesflun\\". Description Residence of the sisters, God's House Hospital, Southampton In 1894 the buildings were described as forming a small quadrangle with a lawn and trees in the centre. On the north side lay the residences of the \\"sisters\\" (four under one roof). Exactly opposite, on the south side, was the chapel. The warden's house, on the west, faced the \\"brothers'\\" residences on the east ‚Äì the latter being an exact counterpart of those of the \\"sisters\\". However, in its earlier days the hospital stretched out behind the Warden's House, along the High Street, and up to Gloucester Square, where in ancient times was a friary of Franciscan Minorites, from which the God's House domain was separated by a mound of earth. Here stood the refectory, the kitchen, and the infirmary buildings. There would also have been a graveyard or cemetery, though no traces of it have been found. The warden's house was long and narrow with a garden attached. By 1894 it had been converted into two separate dwellings, leased to tenants unconnected with the hospital, and a solid iron railing separated it from the quadrangle.Whitlock, p. 22 The residences of the brethren and sisters consisted each of one sitting-room, one bedroom, and a small kitchen or scullery, and were described as affording \\"ample room and a comfortable home for one person\\". The two residential blocks were identical, with two sets of rooms are on the ground floor an intermediate staircase ascending to the two sets over them. The four brethren and four sisters occupied the residences, free of rent, rates, taxes, and repairs. The whole institution was supervised by a chaplain appointed by Queen's College, usually one of the clergy of Southampton. The chaplain did not reside at God's House.Whitlock, p. 23 In 1894 there was a blocked up Norman doorway exactly opposite the west door of the chapel, the entrance to some previous large building, whose site was occupied by coal cellars. =Chapel= Interior of God's House Chapel, c. 19th century Exterior of the chapel in 2014 The Chapel, dedicated to St. Julian, the patron saint of travellers and wayfarers, was rebuilt with the pensioners' residences in 1861.Whitlock, p. 24 It was restored on the foundations of the old chapel; but a breast-high quatrefoil insertion, in the southwest corner of the old chapel, outside the gate-tower and through which a view of the interior could be obtained without entering it, was not repeated in the restored portion. The chapel is long by about wide, lighted by plain Norman windows, having a chancel arch of the Early English Period, as it was verging on to the decorative style of architecture. The reredos and altar that were present in 1894 were placed there with permission of the College by members of the French Protestant congregation, to whom most of the furniture belonged. With one exception, all the tablets were in memory of French pastors, who from the days of the Huguenots had ministered there.Whitlock, p. 25 A brass fastened to a mahogany slab, about long, with a head of alabaster attached, was stated to be the figure of Wallerand Thevelin, one of the French ministers in 1584. However Henry March Gilbert remarked that \\"the dress points to a much earlier period, and it no doubt represents one of the priests or chaplains of the 13th or 14th century\\". There is a small head, carved in stone, over the (inside of) west door. The west door was added to the old chapel in 1299, subsequently closed, and was re-opened about in the mid to late 19th century for the better accommodation of the worshippers. Until then there had been only one entrance to the Chapel, on the north side, from the quadrangle. Outside, in the southeast corner of the quadrangle, there were remains of the old chapel, believed to have been taken from St. Julian's at its restoration in 1861.

This was used by Sharjah International Airport until 1977 when a new inland airport was constructed. Al Mahatta Fort (\\"the station\\" in Arabic) is located in central Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The fort was built by the Ruler of Sharjah in 1932 to afford protection for the passengers and staff of Imperial Airways. It was the first British establishment on the Trucial Coast, after an agreement was struck between the British government (on behalf of Imperial Airways) and the ruler of Sharjah in June 1932. The Fort was used by the Royal Air Force in World War II and the Trucial Oman Scouts before briefly becoming a hotel, a police station and is now an aviation museum, known as the Al Mahatta Museum.  History  The Imperial Airways Empire Route was originally established on the Northern Shore of the Persian Gulf, with Imperial Airways seaplanes landing off Hengam Island, but the agreement to use the route made with the Persian Government lapsed in 1932 when the Persian Government attempted to use the continuation of rights to the facility as leverage to gain British recognition for the Persian claim to the Tunbs Islands - a claim the British refused to countenance.Baxter, CW Memo, Foreign Office to Air Ministry dated 15th March 1932 IOR/L/PS/12/1966 As a consequence, a Southern route was sought. Negotiations with several Trucial Sheikhs resulted in British offers to establish a presence being rejected. A site at Dibba, on the East Coast, was scouted and briefly considered - and would have provided a welcome relief to the harried Al Qasimi wali of Dibba, who was under aggressive pressure from both the Sharqiyin and Shihuh tribes.Imperial Airways to Air Ministry, 10th March 1932 IOR/L/PS/12/1966 However the Dibba site was judged impracticalTelegram from RAF HQ Iraq to Air Ministry, 9th April 1932 IOR/L/PS/12/1966 and a location outside the coastal town of Sharjah was selected.Imperial Airways to Air Ministry, 23rd March 1932 IOR/L/PS/12/1966 Sharjah's Ruler agreed - with reservations - to host the airfield. An agreement was made on 22 June 1932 with the Ruler, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, which secured him a monthly rental of 800 Rupees for landing rights and fees and a personal subsidy of 500 Rupees. Concerned that the airfield would result in British interference in Sharjah's internal affairs, Sultan bin Saqr also gained assurances that British shipping would route through Sharjah, providing income for the town's traders. The negotiations between the British and Sultan bin Saqr were briefly interrupted when the British resident in the Persian Gulf, Hugh Biscoe, suffered a heart attack and died at sea en-route to Sharjah.Confidential report: Dickson to The India Office, 4th August 1932 IOR/L/PS/12/1966 Sultan bin Saqr eventually agreed to build a rest-house for crew and passengers which was fortified against \\"possible but unlikely raids by bedouin\\" according to the 1937 documentary film Air Outpost, which featured Sharjah's airport. The ruler also supplied a number of armed men as guards.Air Outpost on Vimeo. = Overnight stop = Sharjah was an overnight stop between Baghdad and Jodphur on the Imperial Airways Eastern Route from Croydon to Brisbane, Australia. It was the first British establishment on the Trucial Coast. p 171 The route was originally flown by Handley Page HP42s, with two weekly flights landing in Sharjah on Sunday and Wednesday evenings on the outbound flight and Wednesday and Saturday evenings on the return flight.Imperial Airways; flight schedule, 1936: Empire Route A backup landing strip was established in Kalba in August 1936, resulting in Kalba's ruler, Said Bin Hamad Al Qasimi being recognised by the British as a Trucial Ruler. By 1938, Sharjah was no longer an overnight stop on the route although the Imperial Airways flying boat service from Sydney to London included an overnight stop in Dubai, following the establishment of Civil Air Agreements with Dubai's ruler. The outbreak of skirmishing between Dubai and Sharjah in 1940 threatened the security of Sharjah's airport and led to unusual intervention by the British political agent in a land-based dispute: the British had previously restricted their interests and treaties purely to maritime affairs. The airport was used extensively during World War Two by the RAF, and a new agreement was made with the Ruler of Sharjah establishing an RAF base, which remained in use through to British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971. No longer in use by Imperial Airways (or its successor BOAC), in 1951, it became the home of the Trucial Oman Scouts. The airstrip remained in constant use until the development of the current Sharjah International Airport in 1977. The fort building became the Seaface Hotel, then from 1973 was used as a police station, before falling into disrepair. It was restored in the late 1990s to open as a museum in 2000.  1937 Film: Air Outpost  Produced in 1937 by documentary maker Paul Rotha for Strand Films, Air Outpost set out to tell the story of \\"24 hours at the airport and city of Sharjah, on the Persian Gulf\\". The film, featuring a score by British composer William Alywn, forms a rare and important historical document of Sharjah and the airport and fort at Mahatta which were at the time, according to the film, \\"A mile away from the Arab city of Sharjah\\" and which are now in its centre. Al Mahatta Fort in the early 1990s, prior to restoration. Although dated 1937, the film itself was actually shot in November 1936, Rotha having picked Sharjah for his film as he had travelled the Imperial Airways route a month after its inauguration and before the Mahatta Fort had been built, consequently sleeping in tents. Al Mahatta Museum On 14 March 2000, the Al Mahatta Museum was opened, to celebrate the history of flight in the UAE and the region.

Hack Attack was published by Random House's imprint Chatto and Windus in the United Kingdom, by House of Anansi Press (Canada) and by Farrar, Straus and Giroux's imprint Faber and Faber Inc, in the USA. Background Hack Attack is Davies's first book since his 2008 work on the British press, Flat Earth News. Davies began work on Hack Attack in July 2011 at the same time that parliamentarian Tom Watson began work on his work on the phone hacking scandal, Dial M for Murdoch. Davies and Watson subsequently met and discussed their respective projects. Structure The book contains sixteen chapters divided into three sections; 'Crime and Concealment', 'The Power Game' and 'Truth'. The book is prefaced by a 'Who's Who' of people mentioned in the book and an author's note. An epilogue ends the book, followed by an appendix that lists 41 private investigators that were used by British newspapers; many of whom have been convicted of various crimes. An extensive bibliography with links to the media and sources used in the book and exhibits are at the book's webpages. Reception Henry Porter positively reviewed Hack Attack in The Guardian, calling it a \\"gripping account\\". Porter wrote that \\"This book is important, not simply because it is written by a superb reporter who took on a seemingly invulnerable criminal conspiracy, or because it is, even after Leveson and the months of evidence in court, the best account we have of the phone-hacking scandal and the attendant police corruption and cover-ups. It is, as well, the story of modern Britain and how its standards and politics have been degraded by one man's ruthless acquisition of power...Davies has laid it all bare in an exciting, clear and honest narrative...\\" Porter concluded by describing the book as deserving \\"a lot of praise and success. It is a masterly summary of the hacking affair, as well as the ingenuity and persistence that lead to great journalism.\\" Porter reserved his sole criticism for the book's subtitle, as he felt that the truth \\"hasn't yet\\" caught up with Rupert Murdoch; the subsequent reorganization of News Corporation in the wake of the scandal left the company and the Murdoch family substantially enriched. Peter Wilby also positively reviewed Hack Attack in The Guardian. John Lloyd gave a largely positive review in the Financial Times, writing that \\"What is revealed here, in painful, careful detail, is a journalism that held power in contempt ‚Äì and, together with power, held in contempt people both famed and obscure, dominant and meek,\\" and that Davies in \\"his exhumation of this trove of journalistic ordure, done a colossal service to Britain‚Äôs democracy.\\" Lloyd ends his review by describing Hack Attack as \\"the book of a very bold reporter about a passage of arms that he won, to our great benefit.\\" David Carr in the New York Times wrote that Davies was \\"...just the kind of person you don't want to have on your tail...He wages a ground war to get at the truth, which comes less in one single ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment than as a slow drip of facts penetrating a tissue of lies. Evidence is destroyed just before he gets his hands on it, the police redact documents so as to denude them of value. Then, just in the nick of time, a confidential source or secret document arrives. In that sense, the book moves right along, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger.\\" Carr wrote that \\"There is so much excess and human pathology on display here, it makes Bonfire of the Vanities seem restrained.\\" Carr also criticized the book's subtitle, writing that \\"...the truth never catches up with Murdoch. True enough, he loves newspapering and has been known to become deeply involved in editorial matters, but no real case is made that he knew the specifics of how his papers were coming up with very private facts about public figures.\\" Carr concludes by opining that \\"It is, in the best way, an old story. A lone gunslinger takes on a dishonest town, and in the end the bad guys flee. It is both more complicated and a bit less satisfying in reality, but that would be another book, and probably a less enjoyable one.\\" In The Daily Telegraph Peter Oborne described Davies as \\"Britain‚Äôs greatest investigative journalist\\" in his five star review of the book, adding that it was \\"as exciting as a thriller but far more important because it provides such a horrifying portrait of the media/political class that has governed Britain in recent years...This book should be compulsory reading in journalism schools and must be read by anyone who wishes to understand how British politics actually works.\\" A more critical review came from Will Gore in The Independent who wrote that Davies 'knows how to weave a compelling tale', and that his 'account of how Murdoch and his dysfunctional lieutenants ensnared, enslaved, and frightened generations of politicians is blistering. His unpicking of Scotland Yard's early failure properly to investigate phone-hacking is terrific ‚Äì and depressing.' Gore concluded by with the belief that while Hack Attack is a 'great read' its outlook 'sometimes feels a little too black and white: you are either with us or against us.' Two reviewers critiqued Davies's epilogue to Hack Attack that was critical of neo-liberalism. Gore wrote that \\"Davies may be on the side of the just. But he is as ideologically driven as those he despises. In the end, his real target is neo-liberalism, which ‚Äúhas reversed hundreds of years of struggle‚Äù and undermined the protection offered by democratic governments to ordinary working people\\" Lloyd wrote that Davies made a mistake by ending the book \\"with a rant on neoliberalism. It‚Äôs a subject too important for an epilogue of a few pages; it hasn‚Äôt featured much in the preceding narrative; and it‚Äôs hard to agree that it is triumphing in a country, the UK, with a mixed and quite regulated economy whose most popular institutions are the thoroughly socialised NHS and the publicly owned BBC ‚Äì which, to be sure, the Murdoch papers paint as monsters.\\" Positive reviews of Hack Attack were also written by Martin Hickman in The Independent, Erik Wemple in the Washington Post, Dan Kennedy in The Boston Globe, Kirkus Reviews, and Ryan Chittum in the Columbia Journalism Review. =Awards and honours= Hack Attack was longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction and shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award. Esquire magazine named Hack Attack as one of their '5 of the Best Books About Journalism'. Film adaptation It was announced in September 2014 that the American actor and producer George Clooney will direct a film adaption of Hack Attack, and co-produce the film with Grant Heslov, through their company Smoke House Pictures for Sony Pictures Entertainment. Clooney described Hack Attack as having \\"all the elements - lying, corruption, blackmail...The fact that it's true is the best part.\\" Bibliography * References External links *Official site *Interview with Nick Davies on Hack Attack Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Books by Nick Davies Category:Books critical of capitalism Category:Books about the media Category:Books about media bias Category:Chatto & Windus books Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:News International phone hacking scandal ","title":"Hack Attack"},{"id":"43738527","text":"Van Soest v Residual Health Management Unit [2001] 1 NZLR 179 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding nervous shock cases .

In July 2018, all duties of the Taiwan Provincial Government and TPCC were transferred to the National Development Council and other ministries of the Executive Yuan.

It was renamed Provisional Taiwan Provincial Council in December 1951 and Taiwan Provincial Council in June 1959. As all council members were democratically elected, until 1991 National Assembly election and 1992 legislative election, it was the most recognized democratic legislature in Taiwan. In 1996, President Lee Teng-hui decided to abolish most of the governmental functions of Taiwan Province. It was reconstituted as Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council with the streamlining of the Taiwan Provincial Government in 1998. On July 1, 2018, by a resolution passed during the 3606th meeting of the Executive Yuan, all the remaining duties were transferred to the National Development Council and other ministries of the Executive Yuan. The transformations completed before 31 December 2018. However, the government will keep the position of Chairman Speaker of Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council to comply with the requirement set by the Additional Articles of the Constitution.  Council structure  Currently, the only official who serves in the council is the Chairman Speaker of Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council.

According to EU-law Regulation 261/2004 all passengers traveling to and from Europe are entitled to get a compensation between ‚Ç¨250 - ‚Ç¨600 depending on the duration of the delay and flight distance. These laws have been in effect since 2004 but only a few passengers are aware about their rights. For obvious reasons the air carriers don¬¥t spend much effort to inform their customers about their right to be compensated although the air companies are obliged to do so. But the information is to be found on EU¬¥s homepage where the law and its implications are displayed and explained.Europa (European Union website). Passenger rights. Brussels. Obtained 3 September 2014 The number of passengers seeking help from Travelright has risen sharply during 2014 due to the technical problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner used by the Norwegian carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle. Although Norwegian uses Boeing's Gold Care maintenance agreement, the spare parts are stored in the USA and are being sent to Europe when technical problems occur thus causing lengthy delays. But although most passengers are entitled to compensation their claims are usually declined by Norwegian - even after the claims have been tried in the Norwegian authority for consumer rights Forbrukerr√•det.√òyvind Gustavsen och Anne Bergseng. \\"Norwegian trosser transportklagenemnda - nekter aa betale erstatning\\", VG, Oslo, Norway, 12 November 2013 As most carriers makes it difficult or almost impossible for laymen to carry out claims visavi multinational air companies, Travelright as a consumer rights bureau has learned that the only way to deal with these claims is to take them to court. As the big companies have enormous juridical means to fight such claims Travelright has contracted the Swedish lawyer Stephan Eriksson to handle their cases. Stephan Eriksson is specialized in aviation law and during 2014 one principle case about the Dreamliner Experience is being handled by Stephan Eriksson in Attunda tingsr√§tt. The verdict will decide whether passengers are entitled to compensation after their Dreamliner flight has been exchanged for another, older plane.Sj√∂din √ñberg, Helena. \\"Norwegian st√§ms f√∂r utebliven upplevelse\\", Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, 3 September 2014 In Sweden the consumer law makes it possible to claim compensation for delayed flights as far back as ten years. Travelright, which is operating all over Europe, has an application on their homepage where passengers can try if their delayed flight is eligible for compensation or not. Then they can decide whether they want to pursue the claim themselves or use Travelright's service to do so. When Travelright is doing the legal work the company keeps 30% of the compensation for each case that¬¥s being won. If a case is lost the service by Travelright is free of charge. The intention with the EU-law Regulation 261/2004 is to reduce the number of delayed flights and to improve customer care. According to CEO Henric Sch√∂der the aim for TRS Travelright is to inform about current laws and pursue the consumer rights of the European passengers when the air companies fails to abide the law . He also states that the software developed by Travelright that¬¥s processing all flights and weather data concerning Europe is now so advanced that the cases being brought to court will most likely succeed in almost all cases.

Playing career Summersby began his playing career at Millwall, initially as a junior before signing as a professional in March 1952, but did not fully establish himself in the first team until 1957. In December 1958, he signed for Crystal Palace then playing in the Fourth Division in its inaugural season. He quickly became a first team regular and put together a sequence of 126 consecutive appearances, many of them alongside Johnny Byrne. In October 1959, Summersby scored four goals in Crystal Palace's biggest-ever league win; a 9‚Äì0 home victory over Barrow. In the 1960‚Äì61 season, Palace achieved promotion to the third tier and Summersby was ever present, making 46 appearances, scoring 25 goals, which is still (as of September 2014) the fourth highest seasonal goals total in Crystal Palace Post-War history. Only Byrne the same season (30), Andrew Johnson in 2003‚Äì4 (28) and Glenn Murray in 2012‚Äì13 (30) have scored more goals. The next season, Summersby made 42 appearances, scoring eight times, but in 1962‚Äì63 only appeared 17 times (in the first half of the season) and scored twice. At the end of that season, in May 1963, he transferred to Portsmouth, rejoining former Palace manager George Smith.

The farm was built over from 1823 onwards with the newly constructed streets being named after governors of Harrow School. In the case of Aberdeen Place, it was named after George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, who had gone to school at Harrow and was Prime Minister from 1852‚Äì5.

The species was named by the French entomologist Joseph-√âtienne Giraud, in 1859. It is commonly found in eastern Europe and during the 21st century has spread to western Europe. Description Adults lay their eggs on various species of oak, including Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens and Q. cerris, The developing larvae cause the trees to create an elongated gall, reminiscent of a ram's horn, hence the epithet aries and the vernacular name \\"Ram's Horn Gall Wasp\\". Green at first, the gall can be reduced to a single strap or can just be 5 mm long. It later hardens, turns brown and is especially variable when the gall contains inquilines (Synergus species). A. aries is does not cause galls to form on acorns but causes galls to develop on leaf buds on twigs, these have a variety of forms which are due to the activities of parasites and inquilines. Its sexual stage is found on the catkins of Evergreen Oak In northwestern Europe, at least, their reproduction is solely asexual generation, however, experiments have demonstrated that newly emerged females will lay eggs in the axillary buds of Quercus cerris. A. aries has been found, like other species of gall wasp which have colonised the British Isles, to have been utilised by native parasitoids since their arrival, and that their parasitoids from continental Europe have not followed them across the English Channel. Distribution It is found primarily in eastern Europe, but in the 21st century has spread to western Europe including the United Kingdom. If was first recorded in Maidenhead Thicket, Berkshire in 1997 and since then has spread all over the southern half of England.

P.Naumenko: Academic Works Early life Graduated from Klovskiy Lyceum (Kiev, Ukraine) in 1982 and went to National Aerospace University ‚Äì Kharkiv Aviation Institute, having graduated with distinction in 1988 as an engineer- mechanic. Naumenko started to work as Master of the manufacturing site at the aggregate-assembly workshop of Kharkiv Aircraft Plant. At this period, KSAMC launched a series production of An-72 (first flight of the serial An-72 was on 20 December 1985). An-72 became the base for a whole new family of multi- purpose airplanes An-72 / 74 nicknamed as \\"Flying SUV\\" due to their unique flight characteristics, simplicity of service and capability to take off and land on poorly equipped runways.

InterAMI: Style of the High Flight The most famous projects of the company were joint production of Amitron TV sets with Samsung (1992‚Äì1995) and production of polymer products according to the technology of the German company ADM Isobloc (1994‚Äì2004). InterAMI restores its collaboration with KSAMC in 1996 the result of which was a specialized enterprise \\"KSAMC Trading House\\" for professional promotion of An-74 of different modifications on the international market, which enabled to implement a contract with the Government of Iran to deliver 12 An-74 aircraft in the middle of economic crisis in Ukraine. InterAMI sets up its engineering department InterAMI- Interior that designs and develops aircraft and helicopter interiors, particularly for An-74 and An-140 in 1999. \\"InterAMI-Interior\\" succeeded to radically change old-fashioned post-Soviet aircraft interiors on new technological Western types, which were more competitive on the market. Pavel Naumenko leads InterAMI in the process of setting up a new airline Aeromist- Kharkiv in 2002.

It was acquired by Jos√© Quiroga P√©rez de Deza, husband of the author Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, to serve as their summer residence. In 1939, their daughter Blanca Quiroga donated it to the army to be used as a summer camp for children orphaned in the Spanish Civil War. The castle served this purpose until 1978.

It is scheduled to open in 2021. Focus The mission of the M+ museum is to focus on \\"20th and 21st century visual culture, broadly defined, from a Hong Kong perspective and with a global vision. With an open, flexible and forward-looking attitude, M+ aims to inspire, delight, educate and engage the public, to explore diversity and foster creativity.\\" The museum is intended to rival the Tate Modern, New York's MoMA and the Centre Pompidou in terms of the breadth and importance of its collections. The M+ museum is led by Executive Director Suhanya Raffel and administered by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA), a statutory agency of the Hong Kong government. A separate subsidiary company will be set up in the future with the aim of ensuring its \\"independence and efficiency\\". The inaugural director, Lars Nittve, explained that the name is drawn from the concept of being a \\"museum and more\\", and that his team sought to move beyond the typical model of the art museum, for example, by serving as a showcase of diverse subjects like architecture, film, and all manner of moving images including animation and video games. Building design After an architectural competition, six finalists for the design of the M+ museum were announced in 2012, namely Herzog & de Meuron and Farrells, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA), Renzo Piano Building Workshop, Shigeru Ban and Thomas Chow Architects, Sn√∏hetta, and Toyo Ito and Benoy. Each team was compensated with $1 million Hong Kong dollars. The winning design, by Herzog & de Meuron and Farrells, was announced by the WKCDA in June 2013. As part of the Masterplan for the West Kowloon Cultural District designed by Foster + Partners, the architects proposed incorporating the use of underground \\"found space\\", referring to the space surrounding the Airport Railway tunnels running directly beneath the site, as a \\"radical\\" subterranean exhibition and performance area. The building's design has the basic appearance of an upside- down T. The main horizontal slab housing exhibition spaces is lifted off the ground, permitting pedestrian circulation underneath. Above, a tower houses \\"public restaurants, lounges and gardens\\" along with offices and research facilities. Of the structure's total 700,000 square feet (approx. 65,000 m¬≤), plans call to reserve 185,000 square feet (approx. 17,000 m¬≤) for exhibitions, only slightly more than MoMA. In addition to the interior space, an LED lighting display system will be integrated into the horizontal louvres on the facade, serving as a gigantic screen for works of art, visible across Victoria Harbour. Construction of the museum building began in 2014. A time capsule containing artwork of local schoolchildren, to be unsealed 100 years hence, was laid on the site in 2015. The building topped out ahead of schedule in late 2018 and is due to be handed over to the M+ team in late 2019-2020. The public opening is currently scheduled for late 2020 or in 2021. Activities Temporary sculpture park The M+ museum has sought to engage the public by holding numerous preview activities and exhibitions under the banner of \\"Mobile M+\\". \\"Mobile M+: Yau Ma Tei\\" was held in 2012. The museum commissioned seven Hong Kong artists to create installation work scattered throughout Yau Ma Tei, an older district of Kowloon near the site of the future museum. The projects ‚Äì by artists Kwan Sheung-chi, Wong Wai-yin, Leung Mee Ping, Erkka Nissinen, Pak Sheung-chuen, Tsang Kin-Wah and Yu Lik-wai ‚Äì focused on issues surrounding Hong Kong history and politics. \\"Mobile M+: Inflation!\\" was a display of six giant inflatable sculptures on the vacant lands of the future West Kowloon Cultural District. Artists represented included Jeremy Deller, Paul McCarthy, Tam Wai Ping and Cao Fei. It was presented from 25 April to 9 June 2013 and attracted over 150,000 visitors. \\"Mobile M+: NEONSIGNS.HK\\" is an online exhibition of Hong Kong's neon signage, an iconic feature of the city yet one which the museum noted is \\"fast disappearing\\". The website displays curated and commissioned written and visual submissions alongside photographs selected from more than 4,000 crowdsourced submissions. M+ has also acquired, for its permanent collection, some neon signage which had been threatened with destruction. \\"Building M+: The Museum and Architecture Collection\\" was a showcase of the museum's growing architecture collection, held from 10 January to 9 February 2014 at the ArtisTree gallery in Taikoo Shing. At the time of the exhibition, the architecture collection comprised around 1000 items, of which over 120 were displayed. The event also showcased the future design of the museum building, as well as the other five shortlisted entries from the architectural competition. \\"Mobile M+: Live Art\\", presented in late 2015, was a live art programme and exhibition about past performance art. It was held in various venues around Hong Kong and showcased artists including John Cage, Patty Chang, and several local artists. Collection In keeping with its mission, the collection of the M+ museum comprises a broad spectrum of media by international artists, including \\"sketches, electronic media, installation, objects, painting, photography, architectural models, printed matter, sculpture and time-based intangibles.\\" On 12 June 2012 Uli Sigg, a Swiss collector of the reportedly largest and most comprehensive collection of contemporary Chinese art in the world, announced that he would donate the majority of his holdings to M+. This founding acquisition included 1,463 donated works by 325 artists, \\"conservatively valued\\" at $1.3 billion Hong Kong dollars, in addition to a purchase from Sigg of a further 47 works for $177 million. Upon opening, the M+ Sigg collection will be presented \\"in isolation\\" within the museum building, and afterward displayed in the context of the overall collection. Sigg stated that he selected the Hong Kong museum over one in Mainland China because the collection includes works by artists suppressed by the Chinese government, for example 26 pieces by Ai Weiwei. In the same vein, the museum has acquired almost 100 photos of Liu Heung Shing's \\"China After Mao\\" series, including photos of the bloody aftermath of the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Founding director Lars Nittve stated that, despite a warning from pro-Beijing Legislative Councillor Chan Kam-lam \\"not to mix art and politics\\", the museum would \\"not steer away\\" from politically sensitive issues. In 2013, the museum announced that it had acquired the \\"most comprehensive collection [...] by a public institution\\" of the performance art of New York City-based Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. As of 2013, the museum reported that it had acquired 800 works, with over 80% by \\"local artists and designers,\\" including graffiti works by Tsang Tsou Choi (the so-called \\"King of Kowloon\\"), which were donated. By March 2014, the collection was reported to have grown to roughly 2,700 works. Among the first non-Asian artists to be included in the collection is Candice Breitz. In line with the M+ museum's aspirations to present a broad spectrum of artifacts from visual cultural realms outside of traditional visual art forms, the M+ collection also includes a number of architectural works, including works by Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, architectural models by Ma Yansong, an architectural model and visualization works by WOHA and an entire sushi bar designed by Shiro Kuramata. In 2019, the museum acquired the entire archive of influential British architecture collective Archigram, despite purported attempts to block the sale to an overseas buyer.

The United States team had won the previous seven gold medals at the Olympics, and was favored to win another in Munich at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Both teams convincingly won their first eight games of the tournament. The US team put its overall Olympic record at 63‚Äì0 and met in the final against the Soviet Union. Background The United States and Soviet Union sporting adversary reached its peak during the Cold War. The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Americans had not lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63‚Äì0 before the final game. Since the 1952 tournament the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964 and bronze in 1968. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in FIBA World Championship play (at the 1959 world tournament and the 1963 world tournament). However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. The Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all their top players as soldiers or workers, which allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals. On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the NBA. That disadvantage had not prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat. The confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the basketball court was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly anti-American.Saraceno, Frank (August 6, 2004). Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game. ESPN. There were rumors that the Communist party had bribed the officials because they wanted the USSR to win 50 gold medals at these Olympics in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union. Preparation The United States team was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team did not have a clear leader. A rising star Bill Walton declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as Doug Collins or Tommy Burleson (the tallest player among all teams). The young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars Sergei Belov, Modestas Paulauskas, and Alexander Belov. The players had played together for more than seven years. For Gennadi Volnov it was the fourth Olympic appearance. Road to the final The basketball gold medal was the last in contention. The Soviets were clearly ahead in the medal standings, but for the political reasons they needed to win 50 golds (having 49 before the final match). Both teams reached the final without any trouble. For the U.S. team the hardest game was against Brazil which it won 61‚Äì54. Soviets faced some problems against Puerto Rico (100‚Äì87) and Cuba in the semifinal (67‚Äì61). During the game The Soviets surprised the Americans early, led by Sergei Belov. The Soviets kept the Americans 4‚Äì8 points behind during the first half. At half-time the score was 26‚Äì21. In the second half the Soviets provoked Dwight Jones, the leading scorer of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute during a loose ball scuffle he was assailed by Mikheil Korkia and responded.Gallagher, Taps. \\"The 1972 Olympic Basketball Final: 'Stolen Glory',\\" Huffington Post (August 1, 2012). Both players were ejected. After this, Ivan Dvorny was also disqualified for protesting from the bench.\\"VIII Olympic Basketball Tournament (M√ºnchen 1972),\\" Linguasport. Retrieved March 14, 2020. The Soviets benefited from the double ejection, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones was to the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov violently injured Jim Brewer during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. The referees failed to properly assess the flagrant foul. With ten minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to ten points. The Americans began to press, and led by Kevin Joyce were able to cut down Soviets' lead to one with thirty eight seconds left. With seven seconds to play, Doug Collins stole Alexander Belov's cross-court pass at half court and was fouled hard by Zurab Sakandelidze as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Lead referee Renato Righetto turned away from the free throw attempt upon hearing the horn, but failed to stop play. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50‚Äì49. Controversy =First inbounds play= Immediately following Collins' second free throw, with the ball then being a \\"live\\" ball under the rules at the time, Soviet assistant coach Sergei Bashkin charged out of the team's designated bench area to the scorer's table. He asserted that head coach Vladimir Kondrashin had called for a time-out, which should have been awarded prior to the second free throw, but that it had not been granted to them. Since a time-out could not legally be called after the second free throw, however, the Soviet players had to immediately inbound the live ball without a pre-planned play for the final three seconds. Alzhan Zharmukhamedov inbounded the ball to Sergei Belov, who began to dribble up the sideline, but the disturbance at the scorer's table led Righetto to stop play just as Belov approached mid-court. The game clock was stopped with one second remaining. When play was stopped, the Soviets pressed their argument about the time-out, with Kondrashin and Bashkin claiming that it had been called as soon as Collins was fouled. By the rules at that time, a time-out could be requested either by informing the scorer's table directly, or by pressing the button of an electronic signaling device, which in turn would illuminate a light bulb at the scorer's table to alert the officials there of the coach's desire for a time-out. According to Kondrashin, he requested his time-out by pressing the button. Also by the rules at the time, upon calling a time-out prior to free throws, the coach was allowed to choose to have it awarded either before the first free throw or between the two free throws; In contrast to the time-out procedures used in 1972, FIBA rules as of 2012 did not allow for the granting of a time-out between free throws. Under Rule 18.2, a time-out can only be granted during a \\"time-out opportunity\\", and a time-out opportunity that begins with a dead ball preceding an attempted free throw would end once the player is given the ball for that free throw attempt. he said he had chosen to take it between the two free throws. The game's referees, however, were not informed of a Soviet time-out request prior to giving the ball to Collins for the second free throw. With regard to the resulting questions of whether he had ever actually made a proper time-out signal, Kondrashin claimed to have later seen a film of the events that he said showed the light bulb illuminating, as well as an official at the scorer's table nodding toward him in apparent recognition of the request. Regarding what happened next and his choice of when to take the requested time-out, Kondrashin said that the officials at the scorer's table \\"wanted to give me the time-out before the first free throw; of course I refused.\\" However, Hans Tenschert, the game's official scorekeeper, later blamed the Soviet coaches, claiming that they mishandled their signaling device and were therefore late in pressing it. The unexplained horn that sounded as Collins was shooting the second free throw may have happened because the scorer's table had recognized the Soviet time- out request at the last moment and was attempting to stop the second free throw to award it. Renato William Jones, the secretary general of FIBA at the time, later asserted that the problem had indeed been a human error at the scorer's table which resulted in the time-out request being relayed too late to the on-court officials.Associated Press. (September 11, 1972). \\"U.S. cagers won't take silver medal for losers\\", Telegraph-Herald Despite Kondrashin's and Jones' assurances, the Americans have expressed doubt that the time-out was really called. They have also argued that regardless of whether a time-out may have been missed, the ball became live upon Collins' second free throw, and as such, a technical foul should have been assessed against the Soviets because their coach left the designated bench area during live play. According to Righetto, after considering the Soviet arguments, the official decision was to deny the time-out. The protest later filed by the United States also mentioned that the game's official score sheet included no indication of a time-out being granted in the last three seconds. Collins has also confirmed that officially, the time-out was not awarded, which meant that Collins' second free throw counted and that neither team was to be allowed to substitute players when play resumed. Further indicators that no time-out was officially granted to the Soviets can be found in the existing television footage of the game, which includes shots of the scoreboard, both before the incident and at the game's conclusion, with the scoreboard indicating each time that Soviets had one time-out remaining. During the period between the game's interruption and resumption, the footage also does not include the sound of the scorer's table horn that typically would be used to signal both the start and the end of an officially charged time-out. However, even without being granted an official time-out, the minute-long delay to restore order on the court and determine how to proceed still gave the Soviet coaches time to confer with their players and devise a planned inbounds play. Furthermore, although Bashkin's actions had caused the game to be stopped with one second remaining on the clock, the officials decided neither to resume play from that point, nor to assess a technical foul against him for having interrupted the play. They instead wiped out the play altogether, ruling that the entire inbounds sequence would be replayed from the point immediately following the second free throw and that the game clock would thus be reset to three seconds. Jones, who had had a contentious relationship with American basketball officials for a number of years, came down from the stands to the court to contribute to the officials' ruling, and he insisted upon a complete replay of the final three seconds. According to Tenschert, Righetto had initially declared that play would resume with just one second remaining, only to be overruled by Jones.Ellis, Jack. (September 11, 1972). \\"Russian cage gold upheld; U.S. turns down silver\\", Stars and Stripes Jones later acknowledged that under the Olympic regulations, he had no authority to make rulings about a game in progress, though he maintained that resetting the clock was the correct course of action. Ed Steitz who, over the course of his basketball career, served both as the president of USA Basketball and as a member of FIBA's Technical Committee, claimed that years after the game, Jones privately confided that with the clock reset still leaving only three seconds to play, he had not expected the Soviets would actually be able to score within that time. =Second inbounds play= The players were brought back into position for a second inbounds play. However, instead of Zharmukhamedov returning to throw the inbounds pass, Kondrashin managed to substitute Ivan Edeshko into the game in Zharmukhamedov's place. Kondrashin's plan was to have Edeshko attempt a length-of-the-court pass to center Alexander Belov near the American basket, confident that Belov could catch any pass thrown accurately to him there and feeling that Edeshko was the player most skilled in executing such a pass. The two players had successfully run much the same play for CSKA Moscow team the preceding year to claim the Soviet Championship. Under the Olympic rules, substitutions were not to have been allowed without the granting of the time-out, but the referees resumed the game, failing to notice this issue and also not noticing that clock operator Andre Chopard was still working on getting the game clock set to three seconds. The ball was given to Edeshko to start play, with the scoreboard clock actually showing 50 seconds remaining. Edeshko was defended at the end line by American center Tom McMillen. With his frame, McMillen aggressively challenged Edeshko's inbounds attempt, making it difficult for Edeshko to pass the ball into play. Edeshko ultimately made only a short pass to teammate Modestas Paulauskas standing in the Soviet backcourt. Paulauskas then immediately relayed a pass toward Belov at the other end of the court. But the horn sounded, with the pass barely out of Paulauskas's hand. The pass then missed its mark and was uneventfully tipped off the backboard. The players, the announcers of both television broadcasts, and the majority of the spectators in the arena all interpreted the sound of the horn, combined with the sight of a failed Soviet pass, as the end of the game. People flooded the court and the U.S. team began a joyful celebration of its apparent one-point victory. With Jones still involved in the process, the officials once again ordered the court to be cleared, the players to be brought back into position, the clock to be reset, and the final three seconds be replayed. Furious over the decision to deny the U.S. victory and allow the Soviets yet a third inbounds play, the U.S. coaches briefly considered unilaterally declaring the game to be over by pulling their team off the floor. However, head coach \\"Hank\\" Iba was concerned that such an action would leave the U.S. vulnerable to a Soviet appeal, which might lead to a ruling that the U.S. had forfeited the game. U.S. assistant coach John Bach reported that Jones threatened him directly with such a forfeiture should the U.S. team not return to the floor. In finally deciding to comply with the officials, Iba reportedly told his coaching staff, \\"I don't want to lose this game later tonight, sitting on my butt.\\" =Third inbounds play= On the third inbound try, McMillen was again assigned to use his height to challenge Edeshko's inbound pass. However, as official Artenik Arabadjian prepared to put the ball into play, he gestured to McMillen. McMillen responded by backing several feet away from Edeshko, which gave Edeshko a clear view and unobstructed path to throw a long pass down the court. McMillen later said that Arabadjian had instructed him to back away from Edeshko. McMillen said that despite the fact that there was no rule which would require him to do so, he decided to comply, fearing that if he did not, Arabadjian might assess a technical foul against him. For his part, Arabadjian has denied that his gesture was intended to instruct McMillen to back away from Edeshko. In any event, McMillen's repositioning left no American defender to challenge Edeshko's pass. Unlike the previous play, where he had been forced to make a short pass into the backcourt, Edeshko now had a clear line to throw the ball the length of the court toward Alexander Belov. Edeshko would later confirm that McMillen's backing away made it easy for him to throw the long pass downcourt. In the Soviet Union, Edeshko's throw would eventually come to be known as \\"the golden pass\\". The images of the play broadcast on American television by the ABC network have led to the question of whether Edeshko might have stepped on the end line‚Äîmeaning that he should have been called for a violation‚Äîas he made his pass. As Edeshko's full-court pass came down, Belov, Kevin Joyce and Jim Forbes all leapt for the ball near the basket. Belov caught the ball in the air, and as the three men landed, Joyce's momentum carried him out of bounds, while Forbes came down off-balance and fell to the floor beneath the basket. Belov then gathered himself and made an uncontested layup, scoring the winning points as the horn sounded for the last time.

Herbert Mols, serving as the resident manager of the U.S. team, and U.S. Olympic Basketball Committee chairman MK Summers, filed a detailed protest, which was heard by FIBA's five-member jury of appeal. Mols and Summers contended that the final three seconds of the 40-minute game were consumed by the two seconds that elapsed on the first inbounds play and the one second that elapsed on the second play, thus marking the legal end of the game at that point and a United States victory by the score of 50‚Äì49. The protest asserted that allowing a third inbounds play with the clock reset to three seconds brought the total elapsed game time to 40 minutes and three seconds, in violation of FIBA rules which specified the length of a game to be 40 minutes. The jury ultimately voted down the protest and awarded the gold medals to the Soviet team. At the ensuing press conference, Mols engaged in an animated argument with the jury's chairman, Ferenc Hepp of Hungary, about the propriety of resetting the clock to three seconds. Tenschert also angrily dissented with the jury's ruling, declaring, \\"Under FIBA rules, the United States won.\\" In announcing the verdict, Hepp steadfastly refused to provide the specifics of the vote count, acknowledging only that the decision was not unanimous. With three of the five jury members, including Hepp, being from Soviet-allied nations, this fueled speculation that the tally had been 3‚Äì2 and perhaps based more upon Cold War politics than upon the FIBA rulebook. This view was further suggested when jury members Rafael Lopez and Claudio Coccia ‚Äî from US-allied Puerto Rico and Italy, respectively ‚Äî each reportedly confirmed having voted for the United States, thus indicating that pro-Soviet votes could have come only from Hepp of Hungary, Adam Bag≈Çajewski of Poland, and Andres Keiser of Cuba. Nonetheless, Hepp, the only one who had seen all five votes of the secret ballot, maintained his refusal to divulge the specific votes of any of the panel members, beyond later granting that his own vote was in favor of the Soviets. Despite this absence of confirmation from Hepp, it has become generally accepted and reported as fact that there indeed was a 3‚Äì2 vote that matched the political alliances of the time. Aside from potential political motivations, Mols suggested that panel members feared retribution from Jones were they to have deemed his decision regarding the game clock to be incorrect. In any event, the U.S. players did not accept the jury's verdict, voting unanimously to refuse their silver medals, and the team did not attend the medal ceremony. The silver medals are still kept in a vault in Lausanne, Switzerland.Basketball at the 1972 Munchen Summer Games: Men's Basketball. sports-reference.com After the conclusion of the games, the United States Olympic Committee launched another appeal, this time to the executive committee of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It received the support of Righetto, who was quoted saying the Soviet victory was \\"completely irregular, and outsides the rules of the game of basketball\\". Righetto criticized Jones's insistence that the clock be reset to three seconds, and offered that he felt it would have been more fair to have instead resumed play with only the one second on the clock that had been remaining when play was suspended. Righetto also asserted that the initial confusion was partially attributable to a language barrier, as he, a Brazilian, spoke Portuguese, but those working the scorer's table spoke only German. Also supporting the U.S. appeal was Chopard, who noted that in his 12 years of service as a timekeeper, Jones' order to put elapsed time back onto the clock was unprecedented. The appeal was unsuccessful, however, as in February 1973, the IOC ruled that matter fell under FIBA's jurisdiction. Aftermath Sergei Belov in 2012, one year before his death In the ensuing years, USA Basketball has periodically contacted the 1972 U.S. team members on behalf of the IOC to offer them the opportunity to change their stance and accept the silver medals, possibly being granted an official ceremony awarding them. In 1992, team member Ed Ratleff said that although he did not personally want the medal, his wife felt very strongly about his accepting it and being able to show it to their children. He said that his vote would be to accept the medal, but that he was casting his vote that way only in deference to her wishes. In a 2012 interview with Todd Jones of The Columbus Dispatch, Ratleff emphasized that the desire to accept the silver medal was his wife's, not his. Since divorced, he affirmed his intention never to accept it. The ten remaining team members each told the magazine that they would vote to refuse the acceptance of silver medals. With regard to awarding the medals, the IOC has insisted that for such an action, the entire team would need to consent unanimously. Kenny Davis reported that he had gone so far as to have a clause put into his will forbidding his wife, children or descendants from ever accepting the silver medal after his death. In 2012, Davis organized a reunion of the 12 team members‚Äîthe first time they had all been together since 1972‚Äîand reported that after some discussion, the group was unanimous in its rejection of the silver medals. \\"In basketball, there's one winner,\\" he said. \\"By the rules of that game, we won.\\" The gathering included a group round-table interview of the players that was documented in the ESPN 30 for 30 short film Silver Reunion. When the IOC chose to resolve the figure skating scandal at the 2002 Winter Olympics by awarding duplicate gold medals to the original silver medalists, Tom McMillen, who had gone on to become a United States congressman, appealed to the IOC, requesting that the committee revisit its 1972 decision to declare the U.S. team to be the silver medalists of the men's basketball event. The 2002 decision arose because a French judge had been unduly pressured by the Russian officials to inflate the scores of the Russian pair.Thomson Reuters. \\"Figure skating scandal at 2002 Games ushered in scoring reform: Vote-trading scheme initially denied Canadian pair of gold medal,\\" CBC (Jan 12, 2018). The American appeal argued that Jones's unauthorized intervention in 1972 brought similar undue pressure upon the officiating crew of that game. According to McMillen, the IOC did not respond to his appeal.McMillen, Tom. (August 5, 2012). \\"An Olympic D√©tente for the 1972 Men‚Äôs Basketball Team\\", The Daily Beast In the Soviet Union, the outcome of the game was heralded and the players celebrated as heroes, with comparatively little attention given to the controversy surrounding the team's victory. When asked about the subject, Soviet team members have indicated that they view their triumph as having been achieved legitimately. Edeshko and Sergei Belov, in particular, have been critical of the Americans for refusing to accept having lost, with Edeshko saying that he regrets that others may feel the Soviets' gold medals were undeserved, but that he harbors no such doubts himself. From his perspective as coach, Kondrashin acknowledged that the controversy did somewhat diminish his enjoyment of the triumph. However, he still cited the victory as the greatest accomplishment of his basketball career.

Geography  Covering an area of in Notre Dame Mountains, the entrance to the ZEC Chapais is located about 15 km southeast of La Pocati√®re, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. Zec extends to the American border where she shares the border of 12 km; while on the American side (State of Maine), an equivalent and related protected territory extends south for 5.3 km. ZEC has 12 lakes (six of which operated for sport fishing) and six rivers, all operated for recreative fishing. The main water bodies of the ZEC are: \\"East Lake\\" (French: \\"Lac de l'Est\\"), the \\"Five Miles Lake\\" (French: \\"Lac des Cinq Milles\\"),\\" Lost Lake (French: Lac Perdu), the \\"Lake of the Marais\\" (French: Lac des Marais), the Tinoute Lake and Lake boiler (French: lac Chaudi√®re). The territory of the ZEC is crossed in its center by the Wolfe River (French: Rivi√®re du Loup, which flows north to go to pour on the southeast of the St. Lawrence River shoreline.

Anglers can learn about the rules by visiting the official website of the ZEC: Official site of the ZEC. On the territory of the ZEC, the hunting contingency is on for moose, the black bear and small animal. Contingency reflects the particular hunting seasons depending on the species of animal, the type of gear hunting (archery, firearm, collar...), sex of the animals (or calves).  Toponymy  The designation of this area is related to the toponym of the township and village nearby. This gazetteer designation was chosen in memory of Jean-Charles Chapais (1811-1885), who was a businessman and a Quebec politician.

The term Old European languages is also often used more narrowly to refer only to the unknown languages of the first Neolithic European farmers in Southern, Western and Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula, who emigrated from Anatolia around 9000‚Äì6000 BC, excluding unknown languages of various European hunter gatherers who were eventually absorbed by farming populations by the late Neolithic Age. A similar term, Pre-Indo- European, is used to refer to the disparate languages mostly displaced by speakers of Proto-Indo-European as they migrated out of the Urheimat. This term thus includes certain Paleo-European languages along with many others spoken in West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia before the Proto-Indo- Europeans and their descendants arrived. Traces of lost Paleo-European languages The prehistoric Paleolithic and Mesolithic modern human hunter- gatherer Paleo-European languages and Neolithic Anatolian and European farmer languages are not attested in writing (but see Old European script for a set of undeciphered signs that were used in the Vinƒça culture, which may or may not have been a writing system). The only sources for some of them are place names and especially river names that are found all over central and western Europe, and possibly loanwords in some Indo-European languages now spoken there.

Other Paleohispanic languages can only be identified indirectly through toponyms, anthroponyms or theonyms cited by Roman and Greek sources.

Neolithic  There is no direct evidence of the languages spoken in the Neolithic. Paleolinguistic attempts to extend the methods of historical linguistics to the Stone Age have little academic support. Donald Ringe, criticizing scenarios that envision only a small number of Neolithic language families spread over huge areas of Europe, has argued on general principles of language geography applying to \\"tribal\\" pre-state societies, and the scant remains of non-Indo-European languages attested in ancient inscriptions, that Neolithic Europe must have been a place of great linguistic diversity, with many language families having no recoverable linguistic links to one another, much like western North America before European colonisation. Discussion of hypothetical languages spoken in the European Neolithic is divided into two topics: Indo-European languages and \\"Pre-Indo-European\\" languages. Early Indo-European languages are usually assumed to have reached Europe in the Chalcolithic or early Bronze Age, with the Yamnaya, Corded Ware or Beaker cultures (see also Kurgan hypothesis for related discussions). The Anatolian hypothesis postulates arrival of Indo-European languages with the early Neolithic. Old European hydronymy is taken by Hans Krahe to be the oldest reflection of the early presence of Indo-European in Europe. Theories of \\"Pre-Indo-European\\" languages in Europe are built on scant evidence. Basque is the best candidate for a descendant of such a language, but since Basque is a language isolate, there is no comparative evidence to build upon. Vennemann nevertheless postulates a \\"Vasconic\\" family, which he supposes had co-existed with an \\"Atlantic\\" or \\"Semitidic\\" (i.e., para-Semitic) group. The theory, however, is rejected by mainstream linguists. Another candidate is the Tyrrhenian languages, which would have given rise to Etruscan and Raetic in the Iron Age and possibly also Aegean languages such as Minoan or Pelasgian in the Bronze Age. In the north, a similar scenario to Indo-European is thought to have occurred, with Uralic languages expanding in from the east. In particular, while the Sami languages of the indigenous Sami people belong in the Uralic family, they show considerable substrate influence, which is thought to represent one or more extinct older languages. The ancestors of Sami are estimated to have adopted a Uralic language less than 2500 years ago. Some traces of indigenous languages of the Baltic area have been suspected in the Finnic languages as well, but they are much more modest. There are early loanwords from unidentified non- Indo-European languages in other Uralic languages of Europe, as well.

The statues commonly depict European colonial officials such as civil servants, doctors, soldiers or technicians or Europeanised middle-class Africans. They are often characterised by recurrent decorative motifs, such as pith helmets, suits, official uniforms or tobacco pipes, and are painted in bright or glossy colours with vegetable-based paints. As a genre, colon statues originated in West Africa, apparently among the Baoul√© in Ivory Coast. It achieved international popularity after World War II and after decolonisation. It has been argued that the genre originated as an African response to colonisation and the repression at the hands of the colonial state. It is debated whether the statues were originally seen as satirical caricatures of colonial officials or simply depictions of new subjects in local styles. Whether the original statues were intended to be purely ornamental or also served a ritual function is also debated by anthropologists. Among the notable artists who worked in the style was the Nigerian Thomas Ona Odulate (1900-50) whose works are widely exhibited in museums in the United States and Europe. Today, colon statues are widely produced as tourist souvenirs in West and Central Africa.

They were formerly included within the genus Haworthia. Characteristics The genus is characterised by a large size (relative to other haworthias), by their stemless rosette growth form, by the yellow exudate in their non-fibrous leaves, and by their distinctive flowers with robust peduncles. Taxonomy The genus Haworthia was long considered problematic, and suspected of being polyphyletic. It was accordingly divided into three different subgenera: Haworthia (the soft, green, leafy, and often retuse species); Hexangulares (the harder, often tubercled species); Robustipedunculares (the four largest, most robust species). Several phylogenetic studies have confirmed this division, and shown that Haworthia actually comprises three clades that are only distantly related. Based on phylogenetic evidence, in 2013, Gordon Rowley revived the genus Tulista, first erected by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1840, but long consigned to synonymy with Haworthia. However, Rowley adopted a very broad concept of Tulista, in which as well as Haworthia subgenus Robustipedunculares, the genus included Astroloba and Aloe aristata (now Aristaloe aristata), among other taxa. Later in 2013, this broad concept was rejected by Manning et al. later, and Tulista re-circumscribed to consist of four species, a decision supported by Gildenhuys and Klopper in 2016. Rowley has subsequently defended his original approach to the genus, though it is no longer widely accepted. The same phylogenetic studies suggested that the closest relatives of Tulista were the genera Astroloba and Gonialoe. =Species= In 2014, Manning et al. recognized four species in the genus Tulista, although , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts only three of them. All four species are highly variable, each with many different forms. Tulista kingiana Tulista marginata Tulista minima Tulista pumila *Tulista kingiana (Poelln.) Gideon F.Sm. & Molteno ::Previously known as Haworthia kingiana, it is the rarest and furthest east of the four species. It occurs in the vicinity of Mossel Bay. It has a yellow-green colour, smooth glossy tubercles, and it sometimes has margins and keels. There are compact rounded forms, and thin elongated forms. Some populations also offset. *Tulista marginata (Lam.) G.D.Rowley ::Previously known as Haworthia marginata, this species occurs from the range of T. pumila eastwards, as far as Riversdale. The second largest species, it has fewer or no tubercles and it usually has clear margins and a keel on its leaves. It is also extremely variable in its forms and it is highly prized as an ornamental. It does not usually offset.Rowley, G.D. (2013) Generic concepts in the Alooideae. III:The phylogenetic story. Alsterworthia International Special Issue no. 10:1‚Äì8 and 13(2): 24‚Äì26. *Tulista minor (Aiton) Gideon F.Sm. & Molteno Tulista minor - WCSP ::Previously known as Haworthia minima or Haworthia minor, this species occurs to the south of the range of T. marginata. Here it tends to occur in renosterveld vegetation, often near the coast. It is very densely covered with tubercles and it usually has a blue-green colour. There are compact rounded forms, and thin elongated forms. Some populations offset. *Tulista pumila (L.) G.D.Rowley ::Previously known as Haworthia pumila/maxima/margaritifera, this is the far western species, occurring in the Robertson Karoo vegetation in the Western Cape, South Africa.

Sebro is a name for the ancient Oromo tribe settled in that area (Oromo: afaan) (Amharic: ·ã∞·àé ·à†·â•·àÆ) is the second largest town in the woreda of Ginir. The town is in the Bale Zone in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia and is located at approximately 7011Íûå latitude North and 40038Íûå longitude East. Its location is along the highway (at 512 km spot from Addis Ababa) to Ginnir where the road to the Dirre Sheik Husein Shrine is converged northward. ‚ÄòDello‚Äô is named after a coffee merchants‚Äô temporary market site who came from ‚ÄòDello Buna‚Äô and ‚ÄòSebro‚Äô is the former Oromo tribe settled in the area. The two words combined to form Dello Sebro, meaning Dello of the Sebro tribe.Informant; Ato Alemayehu Begashaw, an 83 year old elder, lived in Ginnir and died in 2009 Dello Sebro is bordered to the north by Abursha Dineshie, the east by Amolicho Lalu, the southeast by Tife Doda, the southwest by Ajjamsa, and the west by Jafera Hulluqqo villages. The Werrangabbo River, which is called the Gololcha in its lower course, passes to the Northeast and serves as a boundary between Dello Sebroo, Jafera Hulluqqo and Abursha Dineshie. Werrangabbo was the main source of drinking water for local people before 1997, but today it is used for cattle during the dry seasons. Dello Sebro is divided into town administration and Peasants‚Äô Village, so both town dwellers, mostly merchants and service givers, and farmers are living in the town. According to the information from the town's administration in 2014 the number of registered permanent residents is 10,180, consisting of 4,968 males and 5,212 females. Most of the residents (above 85%) are Orthodox Christians and the rest are Muslims. The number of Muslim residents is now increasing rapidly. In Dello Sebro there are two churches namely Washa St. Gebriel (established in the 1890s) and St. Medihanealem (established in 1977). There is also one mosque in the area (established before 1974). More than 90% of the residents are Oromo and the rest are Amhara. In Dello Sebro there are two schools. The primary school was opened in 1960, and then developed into a junior school (including the 7th and 8th grades) in 1981, and later developed further to a high school in 2004. The primary school was separated from the former in 2006 and built in its present site. This year in September 2014, the present secondary school first cycle (grades 9th and 10th) is stepped to next second cycle (grade 11th and 12th). There are two wet seasons; the spring wet season in March, April, and May and the Autumn wet season in September, October and November. January is the only month without rainfall. Due to dual rainy season crops are produced twice a year. Located on a volcanic high land area, the villages surrounding Dello Sebro are known grain producers. Barley, Wheat, Maize, teff, Beans, Peas, Lentils, and Niger seed are the major crops produced. Dello Sebro is known in the region for its wheat production. In the autumn markets are full of the sweet sorghum called Tinkish, which has a sweet stem. Moreover, the cattle market of Dello Sebro is the most known in its quality and size in the Bale zone. The largest market is on Monday and Friday is the mini market day.Informant; the current town administrator, Ato Warqu Taye The town now has a gravity powered drinking water pump, a 24-hour hydro electric power plant and a mobile phone network.

It is regarded as one of Lope‚Äôs supreme achievements. Sources Federico's servant Batin closes the play with a comic line, noting that it was based on a true story in Italy - this refers to an event in 1425 under Nicolo III d'Este. De Vega also works in aspects of the story of King David as well as using the 208 novellas of Matteo Bandello (78 of these were translated into French by Boisteau and Belleforest and later into Spanish, in a first edition published in Salamanca in 1589). It may also allude to Philip II of Spain's marriage to his third wife Elisabeth of Valois in 1559 and problems with his first son Carlos, Prince of Asturias. In the view of the play's translator and editor Gwynne Edwards: \\"The relationship in the play between Casandra, the Duke's wife, and his son Federico was not unlike that between Prince Carlos, son of Philip II, and Isabel [Elisabeth] who became Philip's wife and Carlos's stepmother\\"; Edwards argues that these events were recent enough to have embarrassed the court of Philip IV and may have been a reason for the play's withdrawal after one performance.Gwynne Edwards, Introduction to Three Major Plays by Lope de Vega, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, , pp. xxv‚Äìvi. Plot Known for his adulterous and licentious lifestyle, the Duke of Ferrara is convinced to disinherit his illegitimate son and heir Count Federico and to marry in order to produce a legitimate heir. He sends Federico to meet his intended bride, Cassandra. Federico rescues her when her carriage gets stuck in a river ford and he falls in love with her. In the meantime, the Duke agrees to his niece Aurora that she may marry Federico to guarantee his position at court. Federico tries to conceal his love and puts off the marriage to Aurora, so she encourages the advances of Gonzaga, who had accompanied Cassandra to the Ferrara court. Cassandra is also unhappy, since the Duke is still following his dissolute lifestyle. The Duke leaves to fight for the Pope, leaving Federico as regent in his absence. Federico and Cassandra admit to their love for one another and consummate it, but are unknowingly witnessed in a mirror by Aurora. The Duke returns suddenly from the wars, now a reformed man. He receives an anonymous letter revealing the affair between his wife and son, but refuses to accept it until he sees them embracing. He decides he cannot punish them in public, since this will damage his honour, so he decides to cloak their punishment as a political murder. To achieve this, he ties up Cassandra in a room, gags her and wraps her in a blanket. He then tells Federico that he has discovered a nobleman plotting against him, who he has tied up and whom he wishes Federico to kill. Despite misgivings, Federico goes and does so, but the Duke calls in his courtiers, accuses Federico of deliberately killing Cassandra and has them kill Federico.

Geehr, Karl Lueger: Mayor of Fin de Si√®cle Vienna, Detroit: Wayne State University, 1990, , p. 220. However, a significant political strategy of Lueger's was to appeal to women; his female followers were known as his \\"Amazon corps\\", \\"the Lueger Garde\\" or \\"Lueger Gretls\\". He calculated that even though women did not have the right to vote, they had considerable influence on their husbands. To sustain his appeal to them, he maintained the fiction that he was too busy for a private life since he belonged so totally to the people of Vienna.Geehr, pp. 209-10, 223.Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, New York: Oxford University, 1999, , pp. 376-77.

With its facsimiles of love letters from Lueger to her, it caused an uproar. Although it has been described by one historian as \\"often spiteful, morose, and occasionally hysterical\\", it is a valuable source of information on his political tactics and decisions;John W.

His son Nur Devlet became khan but was expelled by his brother Mengli. In 1475 the Turks invaded and put Nur Devlet on the throne. In 1478 the Turks replaced him with Mengli. Nur Devlet entered the Russian service. The Qasim Khanate was a Russian vassal. In 1486 its ruling house died out and Nur Devlet was made Qasim khan. In 1490 he gave the throne to his son and in 1503 he died after a long illness. Government in Crimea First and second reigns (1466‚Äì1469) : In August 1466 the first Crimean Khan Hacƒ± I Giray died and Crimean beys elected his eldest son Nur Devlet. His younger brother Me√±li I Giray revolted. Mengli was generally supported by the Crimean nobility and Nur Devlet by the Great Horde. Mengli became khan in 1467, but was quickly driven out and fled to the Genoese at Kaffa. In June 1468 a delegation of beys went to Kaffa and elected Mengli as khan. They and a Genoese detachment marched on the old capital of Chufut-Kale and in early 1469 Nur Devlet was driven out. He fled to the north Caucasus, was pursued and captured and imprisoned in the Genoese fortress of Sudak. (?The business about Sudak comes from Gaivoronsky (next note). Other sources say he went to Moscow, without details.) Third reign (1475‚Äì1478) : This account of the third reign is extracted from the Russian Wikipedia article on Mengli Giray which follows Oleksa Gaivoronsky,Rulers of Two Continents, Kiev-Bakhchisaray, 2007. There does not appear to be a good account in English Following the Ottoman invasion of Crimea in 1475 Mengli was captured and imprisoned in Istanbul. The Turks were more interested in expelling the Genoese than ruling Crimea. Nur Devlet was released and became khan as a vassal and tributary of the Turks. Eminek was a powerful Bey of the Shirin clan (eastern Crimea on the Kerch Peninsula). In 1476 his brother Hadzhike rebelled and fled to Akhmed Khan of the Great Horde. Akhmed sent an army under Janibeg (son of his brother Mahmud bin K√ºch√ºk) which was driven out by Emenik. In the fall of 1476 the Sultan ordered Eminek to lead 10000 men against Moldavia where he was defeated. While he was away Janibeg invaded Crimea and made himself khan. In 1477 Nur Devlet expelled Janibeg and regained the throne. Eminek was displeased and wrote to the Sultan asking that Mengli be restored. In the spring of 1478 Mengli was released and returned with Turkish soldiers. He and Emenek drove out Nur Devlet who fled to Poland-Lithuanea. The Poles sent him to Kiev and in 1479 he entered Russian service. Russian exile and government in Kasimov Nur Devlet and his brother Hayder of Crimea fled to Poland and in 1479 he entered Russian service. In 1480, at the time of the Great stand on the Ugra River, he and Vasily Nozdrovaty were sent to attack Akhmed's capital of Serai as a diversion. His son Ber Devlet was killed by a Tatar and the father killed the murderer with his own hand. Far to the north, the Qasim Khanate was a Muslim vassal state of the Russians. In 1486 its ruler died with no sons. Since Nur Devlet was a Muslim and also a descendant of Genghis which gave him a right to be a khan, the Russians made him Qasim khan. He may also have held Kashira at some point. In the first year of his reign the steppe warlord Murtaza sought to overthrow Mengli with the help of Nur Devlet and Ivan III. Ivan warned Mengli. Nur Devlet was sent to guard the southern frontier. In 1478-90 he campaigned against the sons of Akhmed bin Kuchuk. Toward the end of 1490 he gave the throne to his son Satylgan. In 1503 he died after a long illness. At the request of Satylgan and Mengli his remains were sent to Crimea, where he is buried. References Sources * Alan W.

He is however primarily remembered as a highly proficient graphic artist, not only for his woodcuts and engravings but for his contributions to overall book design. Early life Born in Copenhagen, Christensen was the son of a wholesaler. After attending Copenhagen's Technical School, he entered the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, first studying painting under Ejnar Nielsen and Aksel J√∏rgensen (1926‚Äì28) and then graphic arts, also under J√∏rgensen (1930‚Äì38), including woodcuts, etching and lithography. While at the Academy, he demonstrated expertise in both figure painting and landscapes. He continued to practice painting although in 1933, at the age of just 24, he created his first published illustrations producing excellent woodcuts for Steen Steensen Blicher's Brudstykker af en Landsbydegns Dagbog (Diary of a Parish Clerk). Illustrations His illustrations for the works of classical Danish authors including Hans Christian Andersen, Hans Adolph Brorson and Thomas Kingo combine technical proficiency with artistic talent. He also provided illustrations for the works of many foreign authors including William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Nikolay Gogol and Edgar Allan Poe. He produced original illustrations for some 60 books as well as a similar number of reproductions, not to mention a considerable number of individual sheets, often in large formats. When working with books, he took great care in designing the overall presentation of the work including titles, fonts, column sizes, paper quality and layout. In his own words: \\"The book is and must remain an insoluble whole and if there are illustrations they should be seen as something in support of the work. And those of us who produce these illustrations must understand that we are providing a service for something that is much greater than we are; we need to feel admiration and respect for the text.\\" Some of Christensen's finest graphical works were created in Bergen where he taught at the art school from 1955 to 1957. Not only were they considerably larger but they exhibited new inspiration, more sensitivity and improved technique. He was one of the few 20th-century graphical artists from Denmark who developed copper engraving as a logical extension of his woodcuts. Paintings Christensen's paintings from his younger days stem in part from his association with the Odsherred Painters where he painted landscapes in oils. Later he turned to watercolours and pastels and later still to strongly coloured collages. He first exhibited at Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling (Artists' Autumn Exhibition) in 1929, followed by many submissions over the years to Charlottenborg as well as to Corner, Koloristerne and Den Frie Udstilling. Awards Christensen was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1954 and the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1968.

He was also the Director-General of Security leading the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) from 1970 to 1975. Early life Barbour was born in Geelong, Victoria into a family of educators. He was schooled at Scotch College, Adelaide and Geelong Church of England Grammar School.New head of ASIO named, The Canberra Times, Friday 23 Jan 1970, p. 1.ASIO head replaced: Mr Justice Woodward to Take Over, The Canberra Times, Saturday 27 Sep 1975, p. 1. His father was warden of the University of Melbourne Union, and Barbour commenced in residence at Trinity College, Melbourne in 1947, while undertaking studies in Latin and German at the University of Melbourne before joining the Australian Army during World War II. Following his army service, he returned to Melbourne University to study a Master of Arts in German, but was recruited into ASIO in April 1951 before he completed the degree. Intelligence and diplomatic career Barbour's early work at ASIO saw him posted to the Netherlands and Italy as an immigration official, to prevent Communists migrating to Australia. In 1959, he was posted to ASIO's Canberra office as head of counterespionage. His role in entrapping the Soviet diplomat and KGB agent Ivan Skripov gave a boost to his career, and he became head of the Canberra office in 1964, Deputy Director-General in 1965 and in 1970 was promoted to Director-General. Barbour is the only Director-General of ASIO to have been appointed from within the organisation. At the time of Barbour's appointment, ASIO was seen by many Australians as politically compromised, and had been passing information to the Menzies government regarding suspected Communists and Soviet agents associated with the Australian Labor Party. The day after the election of Labor's Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister in 1972, Whitlam's soon-to-be appointed Attorney-General Lionel Murphy (ASIO's responsible minister), met with Barbour to inform him in no uncertain terms that the agency's days of autonomy and lack of ministerial and parliamentary oversight were over. The ensuing strained relationship between the Whitlam Government and ASIO culminated when Murphy raided its Melbourne headquarters on 15 March 1973. In September 1975, the Whitlam Government announced that Barbour had been dismissed as Director-General and was to be posted to the United States as Australian Consul-General in New York. In 1978, he took a consular role in Los Angeles, and from 1981 to 1984 he was appointed Australia's Ambassador to Venezuela. The reasons for Barbour's sudden dismissal by Whitlam were never officially explained. Confidential documents released by the National Archives in 2008 revealed that Barbour's dismissal was by bipartisan agreement between Whitlam and Opposition Leader Malcolm Fraser, and had been recommended by Justice Robert Hope as part of the Hope Royal Commission into the intelligence services. Barbour's successor, Edward Woodward, wrote in his memoirs that Barbour's sacking had followed a lengthy overseas trip with his \\"beautiful Eurasian secretary\\" to ostensibly review overseas intelligence agencies, but for which Barbour had failed to produce any reports, suggestions or information of benefit to the agency.\\"Secrets of the '70s: Spy Head Rolled in Australia's Cold War\\", The Canberra Times, 28 May 2008.

He is one of the first photographers to use and write about the collodion process, which he claimed to have invented. Early life and family Bingham was born in Billesdon, Leicestershire, England, where he was baptised in March 1824. His parents were John Cowener Bingham and his wife, Martha.England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 In 1853, at the British Embassy in Paris, he married Emma Reeve, daughter of surgeon John Reed of Kinver, Staffordshire. She died 15 years later at their home on rue de La Rochefoucauld in Paris. Career Bingham first started working as a chemist at the London Institution. In 1847, he published a new edition of Photogenic manipulation, containing the theory and plain instructions in the art of photography\\", a work that would be expanded and reprinted at least four times over the next few years. He showed 19 photographs at The Great Exhibition of 1851, and was commissioned, as a result of the influence of Henry Cole,a member of the Executive Committee, to print the glass plate negatives by Claude-Marie Ferrier of prize winning exhibits as illustrations for the photographically-illustrated presentation copies of the Report by the Juries. Bingham set up a photographic printing establishment in Versailles in order to undertake this contract. Some of the photographs and others by Bingham were shown in 1852 at the exhibition Recent Specimens of Photography held at the Society of Arts, London, the first exhibition to focus solely on photography. Bingham also made photographs of the Exposition Universelle of 1855 in Paris. His ability to take some 2500 photographs at relatively high speeds on this occasion encouraged other photographers to use the collodion process for their work as well, helping it become the most popular method from 1855 until about 1880. Henry Cole sent him at the same time to the Louvre to photograph the masterpieces of the museum collection. At some point in 1851 1855, or 1859, Bingham moved to Paris to work there as a photographer, at first together with the American Warren T. Thompson until Thompson returned to England in 1856. Bingham not only worked at the 1855 Exposition, but also displayed his own life-size portraits, for which he won a Medal First Class. Due to a lack of commercial success, however, he soon stopped producing these huge photographs and stuck to more standard formats. His work at the Louvre inspired him to make photographic portraiture a commercial enterprise, and in 1857 he opened his new atelier in the Nouvelle Ath√®nes quarter of Paris, one of the hotspots of artistic activity at the time. He became friends with many artists, photographing them and their works, and started on a new project, a photographic collection of the works of the recently deceased painter Paul Delaroche. Published in 1858, it was the first photographic catalogue raisonn√©. It was followed over the next few years by similar works about other artists, including one in 1860 on Ary Scheffer and another one with photographs of the major works of the 1860 Salon. Smaller works with only a handful of photographs were produced for particular collections and for the Napoleon Museum in Amiens. His reproductions of paintings were famed for their suggestion of the original colours in the black-and-white photographs, and were lauded as being far superior to all other similar efforts until then. Gustave Moreau used to send photographs of his paintings, made by Bingham, to people to inform them of his latest creations, without the need to wait for a Salon or other exhibition. Similarly, Gustave Courbet showed his paintings, which were rejected for the Salon, through photographs made by Bingham. His 1863 work \\"Retour de conf√©rence\\", which was even rejected at the Salon des Refus√©s, was destroyed by a fundamentalist Christian, making the photographs by Bingham the only remaining trace of it. But the public outrage about the painting was so great that the government had the negatives destroyed in 1867 as well. Courbet's 1864 \\"V√©nus et Psych√©\\" has disappeared as well and is also only known through Bingham's photographs. Bingham continued to exhibit in Great Britain and France, winning another medal at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. He was one of the leading members of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie, contributing a lot of works to their exhibitions. Early in 1870, he suddenly left Paris for Brussels, where he died in February of that year. His atelier remained open until 1875, publishing more reproductions of his negatives.

Another candidate was Gustave Le Gray, who published another, less practical collodion process in 1850. But until the end of his life, Bingham proudly proclaimed that he was the first to have written about the collodion process, either in his 1848 book or in the January 1850 edition, making him the inventor of the process. While he is generally acknowledged as one of the first inventors to independently suggest collodion as an alternative for paper, the invention is usually still given to Archer because he published the first practically usable description of the process.

De Vries (July 25, 1905‚ÄîMarch 27, 1982), born Lena Moerkerk in Prospect Park, New Jersey, was a Dutch‚ÄìAmerican author, public health nurse, and teacher. She worked as chief of American Hospital Number 3 on the Madrid- Valencia Road during the Spanish Civil War and later organized health clinics in New Mexico, California, and Puerto Rico. She moved to Mexico in 1949 after her membership in the Communist Party was exposed. In Mexico, De Vries taught medicine and public health to indigenous villagers in the Papaloapan River Basin in Oaxaca; taught anthropology and public health at the University of Veracruz; was a founder of CIDOC, a religious, educational and cultural school; and helped found Cemanahuac, an educational community in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Early life and family Born To Elizabeth Pollak and Leonrad Moerkek, Dutch was the language of her childhood home, and De Vries did not learn English until she attended grammar school. After completing the sixth grade, De Vries was sent to work in silk mills. Her work and experience in the silk mills is detailed in her autobiography (1979) Up from the Cellar. In 1921, De Vries' left the silk mills to work for a telephone company in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1925, she matriculated to a nurses training program at New Rochelle Hospital Training School for Nurses in New York. After receiving her nursing degree, De Vries married Wilbur Fuhr (June 5, 1928). A daughter, Mary Lee, was born to the couple in 1930. Shortly after Mary Lee's birth, Fuhr died unexpectedly. De Vries remarried in 1943 to Lou Stoumen and gave birth to a second daughter, Toby, in 1946. Stouman and De Vries divorced in 1949. Life Work De Vries is remembered for her work as a public health nurse in Mexico. Before living in Mexico, De Vries joined the Communist Party in 1935. Two years later, in 1937, she volunteered to travel to Spain with the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy, which provided medical care for the international brigades and Spanish anti-fascist fighters during the Spanish Civil War. She was at the Madrid front in February 1937 during the Battle of Jarama. \\"Within four hours after the battle had begun, we had 93 wounded. Our hospital was equipped for fifty,\\" writes De Vries of the battle in her memoirs. Later, she was sent to Villa Paz where she oversaw the administration of the hospital of Castillejo. Recounting her efforts to sustain the running of the hospital, De Vries managed to convince the male soldiers to participate in the chores needed to free nursing hands, including dish-washing, scrubbing, washing, digging latrines. Her memoirs describe her time at Castillejo as revolutionary in the co-operative that was being formed. Moreover, she writes of the concerns of farmers and soldiers to their own futures, which led to the opening of new clinics and even new trenches that included special sections for classroom work. As such, she remembers this as a time of idealism: \\"This was a crusade for the freedom of man.\\" De Vries, Lini. \\"Crying Would Have to Come Later.\\" In Women's Voices from the Spanish Civil War, edited by Jim Fyrth with Sally Alexandra, 139-145. London, Lawrence and Wishart Limited, 1991. Upon her return to the United States, De Vries embarked on a fundraising lecture tour. When the lecture tour concluded, De Vries worked as a nurse and public health educator. She held positions with the San Miguel County Public Health Demonstration Unit in New Mexico, the Department of Public Health in Puerto Rico, and the Agricultural Workers Health and Medical Association of Southern California. De Vries moved to Mexico in 1949. She was the director of health education for the Comisi√≥n del Papaloapan serving the indigenous communities in the Papaloapan River Valley in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz. She was also an instructor of public health at the Universidad Veracruzana in Jalapa, Veracruz, and established summer schools for foreign students both there and at the Universidad de Morelos in Cuernavaca.

It would propel him into the centre of the political landscape of war torn early eighteenth century Persia.  Rebellion & Separation  Revolts swept through the province during the 1720s as a direct consequence of the Afghan revolt in the eastern provinces of the empire which eventually led to an invasion led by the Hotaki leader Mahmud Hotaki. In a pitched battle Mahmud inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Imperial forces sent from Isfehan in the battle of Gulnabad, after which he marched on the capital itself where he captured Isfehan after a terrible siege. A courtier in Isfahan by the name of Malek Mahmoud Sistani reached an accord with the Hotaki Afghan conquerors in which he would set up an independent kingdom in khorasan in exchange for his recognition of Mahmud as Shah of Persia. Sistani entered Khorasan and managed to regain most of Khorasan from the rebels and local warlords in a relatively short period of time with the capital Mashad falling into his hands. At this juncture Nader had established himself in the fortress of kalat north of Mashad and with a mere force of 1,200 men raided Sistani's territory, although they did not come into direct confrontation Nader had established himself as the only real challenge to Sistani's influence in Khorasan.  Tahmasp II and the siege of Mashad  After the conclusion of the Siege of Isfahan, Mamud sent a contingent of his Afghans to subdue Qazvin where a new Safavid pretender Tahmasp had risen and proclaimed himself Shah. He was forced to flee Qazvin but could not stay in the region permanently as those areas not under Afghan control were unremittingly coming under the marching boots of Ottoman soldiers invading from the west. Tahmasp was chased from the west of the country and in Astarabad found a loyal if difficult subject warlord by the name of Fathali Khan of the Qajar clan. Deciding that it was too soon to march on Isfahan to liberate the heartland of Persia they would begin in Khorasan where they could forge alliances and rally more troops under their banner. Marching toward Khorasan they came into contact with Nader whose loyalty they acquired along with his now much enlarged fighting force (Nader had campaigned against the Kurds and successfully incorporated many of them into his small army). A combined force of 30,000 men lay siege to Mashad with Sistani and his commander-in-chief Pir Mohammad trapped within the city's walls. Tahmasp had developed a tense relationship with Fathali Khan and matters came to ahead on October 10, 1726 when Nader brought Tahmasp an intercepted letter, the damning contents of which provided abundant evidence of a clandestine line of communication between Fathali and Sistani. Nader, fearful that the Qajar contingent may leave if any harm befell their leader, advised Tahmasp to spare his life for the time being. Tahmasp, though agreeing with Nader's judgement, nevertheless had Fathali executed the subsequent day. The Qajar contingent however remained with the Loyalist army despite Fathali's beheading and ironically it was a betrayal on the other side of the conflict that brought the siege to an end where Pir Mohammad allowed Nader to infiltrate the city walls forcing Sistani to take refuge in the citadel, surrendering shortly after.  Aftermath of the Siege  The defeated Malek Mahmoud Sistani was surprisingly treated with courtesy and in a show of reconciliatory mercy allowed to spend the rest of his life as a sage (Though he was executed the following year when he became suspect in Nader's eyes). The results of the siege had gifted the capital of Khorasan to Tahmasp as well as gifting Fathali's position to the sole person of Nader as he now took to subdue the remaining Khans and tribes of the province hence further augmenting his forces. His conquest of Khorasan allowed the Safavid loyalist movement to next focus on an expedition further east towards Herat.

Ignaz Unterberger (24 July 1748, Cavalese - 4 December 1797, Vienna) was an Italian and Austrian painter and printmaker, who was also an inventor. He was a member of a large dynasty of Tyrolean artists.Griffiths and Carey Biography Unterberger was probably born on 24 July 1748See Grant, Sarah (2014). 'The Ornament Prints of Ignaz Unterberger' in Print Quarterly. Volume XXXI. pp. 282, footnote 12. in Ga√ül√∂ss (now called Cavalese), located in the County of Tyrol, today in Italy. His initial artistic instruction came from his uncle Franz Sebald Unterberger (1706-1776). Unterberger Senior taught his nephew the style of the Tyrol. This was High Baroque - famed for intricate church altarpieces, sculpture and frescoes. Artists working in Vienna and Salzburg found themselves training in Rome, including Ignaz's elder brother. Christoph Unterberger (1732-1798)'s influence as a member of the Accademia di San Luca provided Ignaz with access to a pivotal group of Italian artists when he arrived in Rome in 1769. His ability to capture the Italian style was such that his painting 'Maternal Love' was thought to have been Correggio's. Unterberger was a highly capable artist, with experience in creating frescoes, altarpiece paintings, bambocciata and marble work. The artist stated that he only painted for a livelihood, but printmaking was his real passion. Unterberger's printmaking is not particularly well-known, although some of his prints were included in the British Museum's 1994 exhibition and catalogue 'Printmaking in the Age of Goethe'. He did not engage in printmaking until he returned to Vienna from Rome in 1773, when he applied himself exclusively to the mezzotint. His inventions included an excavating machine for digging canals, a foot-pedal for the harp, and a machine for preparing mezzotint plates.Griffiths and Carey Unterberger was never made a member of the Academy in Vienna, despite exhibiting there. Nevertheless his work was highly regarded, and the Imperial Chancellor Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg was a patron. His painting Hebe (1795) was a sensation for its lighting effects, and bought by Emperor Francis II for a large amount. He was also made a Royal and Imperial Court Painter. Unfortunately, he only benefited from this role for two years before heart failure lead to his death on 4 December 1797, leaving a widow and nine children.Griffiths and Carey  Notes   References  * G.

Most TBIs are caused by falls, jumps, motor vehicle traffic crashes, being struck by a person or a blunt object, and assault. Student-athletes may be put at risk in school sports, creating concern about concussions and brain injury. A concussion can be caused by * a direct blow to the head, * or an indirect blow to the body that causes reactions in the brain. The result of a concussion is neurological impairment that may resolve spontaneously but may also have long-term consequences.  Background Many teens engage in extracurricular activities including sports that can pose risk of injury. Some sports that create a more significant risk of a head injury or concussion include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football. High school football accounts for a significant percentage of head injuries that result from high school sports. While performing intense physical activity the brains' structure and functionality can be changed. This alteration in the brain may be a reason athletes in contact sports have concussions at higher. In combination with the contact and altered brain structure this can potentially lead to more severe concussions (Tremblay, Pascual-Leone, Th√©oret, 2018, p.172)..  Prevention  Prevention efforts in high school athletics may include: * Conditioning, teaching and practice of techniques that reduce the chance of injury. For example, a football player who learns the proper way to tackle, spends time in the weight room, and maintains overall good health choices is more likely to avoid situations which put them in harm‚Äôs way. * Concussion response programs that take concussions seriously, limit the number of concussions a student may have while continuing to participate in a sport, and that monitor for recovery and residual effects of concussion. Coaches, parents and students should educate themselves about concussions, including knowing the signs of a concussion, and being prepared to respond appropriately to incidents of head trauma and concussion. Schools should implement formal concussion plans that include elements of education, prevention, recognition, evaluation and management, so as to not only reduce the chance of concussion, but to ensure that concussions are promptly diagnosed and that concussed student athletes receive proper medical care and are not endangered by a premature return to sports. School concussion plans should also have a formal system for tracking compliance, and for identifying and responding to any deviations from the plan's standards.  Signs The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists of possible signs of concussion that may appear in a student-athlete after a jolt to the head or body, including: *a dazed appearance, *confusion, *forgetfulness, *lack of confidence in actions, *clumsiness, *slower than normal, *loss of consciousness, *changes in mood, behavior, or personality, and *inability to remember events prior to, or after the hit. An injured student may report any of these signs as well as sensitivity to light or sound, double vision, a headache, or other abnormal feelings. A student who has been diagnosed with a concussion may become frustrated, impatient, and angry about the situation.  Effects  Concussions not only have physically noticeable effects, but they also leave behind effects not noticeable. Concussions can greatly impact the quality of sleep one receives. Concussions have been shown to cause sleep patterns to become inconsistent. Some nights you may sleep for an extended period of time whereas in others sleep time can be short. With acute concussions, sleep occurs for longer durations when compared to subacute. These irregular sleep patterns can have major health effects by making an individual susceptible to health concerns later on (Raikes, Schaefer, 2016, p. 2145). Concussions have also been shown to increase the risk for mental issues such as depression, CTE, dementia, and other cognitive issues (Guskiewicz et. al, 2005). Concussion also have long term effects on the ability to learn and execute motor patterns. When compared to an individual with no concussions their motor learning speeds are lower and their ability to progress in activity were also lower. In other words, the time it takes to learn new physical activities has decreased as well as their ability to progress in difficulty has been lower. This is due to the brain being damaged and not being able to process information as quickly as a healthy brain (Beaulieu et. al, 2019, p. 105). Concussions are one of the most common injuries amongst high school football players today. They can affect adolescents in the short term and the long term and can have some of the severe outcomes on a players career and life.  Gear issue  In the game of football pads and helmets are good tools but do not completely protect the player. The helmets worn in football defend against most head injuries. These injuries include things like brain bleeds, skull fractures, and possible jaw injuries. What the helmets do not protect against are mTBI or mild traumatic brain injury. This is where concussions occur. Helmets cannot protect against them because they are simply a byproduct on of football. Due to the physicality of the sports, concussion or other head injuries are inevitable. For this to be changed the whole sport in its entirety will have to be changed (Bachynski, Goldberg, 2014, p 323-333). But the choice to play football, in the end, is left to the families and the play themselves. If football is a sport they want to pursue, that is fine.  Response  A concussed player should receive proper medical treatment and should be excluded from practices and games until cleared to play by a qualified medical professional.

He graduated from Norwich University in Vermont and taught at the school until 1867, with a break to serve in the Civil War. He then accepted a position at Illinois Industrial University (today the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign), where he taught for the next forty-four years (1868‚Äì1912). Biography Samuel Walker Shattuck was born in Groton, Massachusetts, on February 18, 1841. He attended preparatory school at Lawrence Academy at Groton, then studied at Norwich University in Vermont, graduating in 1860. He was then appointed an instructor of mathematics at Norwich. Shattuck resigned his position upon the outbreak of the Civil War, becoming an adjutant of the 8th Vermont Infantry. He was wounded during the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864, and was named a captain the next month. He was mustered out with his unit in June 1865. Shattuck then returned to Norwich University as an adjunct professor of mathematics and military tactics. From 1866 to 1867, he was acting president of the school. Shattuck resigned from his position in the summer of 1868 to join the new Illinois Industrial University in Urbana, Illinois. He was named a professor of civil engineering two years later and was appointed a professor of mathematics in 1871. He was acting regent of the school for six months in 1873, then assumed the role of business agent and manager until 1905.

He became the center of a controversy when University of Illinois un-hired him as a professor of American Indian Studies following objections to a series of inflammatory tweets critical of Israel and Zionism. Early life and education Salaita was born in Bluefield, West Virginia on September 15, 1975, to Hispanic and Arab immigrant parents. His mother was born and raised in Nicaragua by Palestinian parents who originated in Beit Jala.Steven Salaita, Israel's Dead Soul, Temple University Press (2012), p. 111. He describes his own ethnic background as both Jordanian and Palestinian. Salaita's father was from Madaba, Jordan. His maternal grandmother lost her home in Ayn Karim outside of Jerusalem in 1948. Salaita received his B.A. in political science from Radford University in 1997 and his M.A. in English from Radford in 1999. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Oklahoma in Native American studies with a literature emphasis.AAUP report: Academic Freedom and Tenure: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, April 2015, p. 6 Career Following completion of his Ph.D., Salaita became an assistant professor of English at University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where he taught American and ethnic American literature until 2006. He was then hired as associate professor of English at Virginia Tech, and received tenure three years later. In addition to teaching English courses, Salaita wrote about themes of immigration, indigenous peoples, dislocation, race, ethnicity and multi-culturalism. Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times refers to him as a \\"respected scholar in American Indian studies and Israeli-Arab relations.\\" Salaita won a 2007 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award for writing the book Anti-Arab Racism in the USA: Where It Comes from and What it Means for Politics Today. The Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights recognized Salaita's book as one that extends \\"our understanding of the root causes of bigotry and the range of options we as humans have in constructing alternative ways to share power.\\" Miriam Cooke, professor at Duke University, described the book as \\"a sobering analysis of anti-Arab racism, from neo-conservative to liberal, rooted in America's settler colonial past and seeping into every corner of our lives. Steven Salaita takes the reader into the crisis of Arab-American communities in the wake of September 11. Written with passion, this lucid account of the dangers of American imperialism paints a dark picture of the agenda of the Bush administration not only in the Arab world but also for people of color at home.\\" Sinan Antoon, assistant professor at New York University, reviewed Salaita's book, The Holy Land in Transit: Colonialism and the Quest for Canaan, published in 2006. He found the author's comparative approach to Palestinian and Native American writers and the influence of politics on their production \\"refreshing\\". He found the strongest chapter to be the one devoted to Salaita's personal experience of spending the summer of 2002 in the Shatila refugee camp, where he introduced Native American studies to the residents and developed perspectives on how \\"alternative narratives can broaden the consciousness of decolonial advocates.\\" Antoon notes that Salaita limited his scope to prose and limited Palestinian literature to English translations. In 2014 to 2015, Salaita was controversially hired and then un-hired by the University of Illinois as detailed in the section \\"University of Illinois hiring controversy\\" below. In July 2015 Salaita announced he had accepted the offer of the Edward W. Said Chair of American Studies at the American University of Beirut, and would begin his assignment in the fall of 2015. Salaita's position at the University of Beirut was not renewed due to some inconsistencies in his hiring. The university stated it was due to \\"procedural irregularities\\". In 2017, Salaita announced that he is leaving academia because no institution would hire him for full time work. As of February 2019, he is a school bus driver in suburban Washington, D.C. Controversies =Virginia Tech \\"Support our Troops\\" controversy= While teaching at Virginia Tech in 2013 Salaita became the center of controversy after writing an article in which he explained his refusal to endorse the \\"Support our Troops\\" slogan. Salaita stated that \\"In recent years I've grown fatigued of appeals on behalf of the troops, which intensify in proportion to the belligerence or potential unpopularity of the imperial adventure du jour\\". He criticized what he called \\"unthinking patriotism\\". Reactions to his article were varied. Some people wanted him fired, criticizing the university, and some wanted him deported or killed. A university spokesman, Lawrence G. Hincker, Associate Vice President for University Relations, said that the university supported Salaita's freedom of speech, but added: \\"While our assistant professor may have a megaphone on salon.com, his opinions not only do not reflect institutional position, we are confident they do not remotely reflect the collective opinion of the greater university community\\". Almost 40 Virginia Tech professors signed a letter protesting Hincker's comments in a letter to the student newspaper, the Collegiate Times. Faculty members criticized the university's statement as \\"wholly unsatisfactory\\" and \\"placing in doubt its commitment to academic freedom.\\" Commenting on Salaita's views and the surrounding controversy, Greg Scholtz, of the American Association of University Professors, noted that \\"[u]pholding academic freedom can be a difficult and even embarrassing,\\" but \\"the most reputable institutions give the most latitude.\\" =University of Illinois hiring controversy= In October 2013, Salaita was offered tenure in the American Indian studies program at University of Illinois which he accepted and he was scheduled to begin in August 2014. In July 2014, the two- month-long Gaza war broke out in which Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians and Hamas 73 Israelis. Salaita posted hundreds of tweets criticizing Israel and its indiscriminate bombings of Gaza. Some of the tweetes were inflammatory and angered pro-Israel students, faculty, and others who accused Salaita of anti-Semitism. Donors threatened to stop donating to the university unless it rescinded Salaita's job offer. University Chancellor Phyllis M. Wise told Salaita that he wouldn't get the job so he sued the university. During the legal proceedings, the university was forced to release hundreds of email relating to his case which revealed both that Wise had come under immense pressure to rescind Salaita's offer from wealthy donors, but also that she had tried to destroy evidence. She therefore resigned from her position as Chancellor. The university settled with Salaita for $875,000 in November 2015. Salaita wrote about his experience in his book Inter/Nationalism: Decolonizing Native America and Palestine, where he engaged with the controversy from the perspective of decolonizing academic scholarship. He writes of boycotting Israel in the academic arena, and further participates in this agenda through the organization USACBI.

In Persian ≈ûems (Shams) means \\"Sun\\" and Ruhsar (R√ªkhs√¢r) means cheeks or face. Here the word \\"sun\\" (Shams) is used as an allegorist for the cheeks or face (Rukhsar).

His work Qadeem Ladakh - Tarikh-o-Tamaddun is a major study of the history of Ladakh from the time people settled in the region up to the post-independent era. Early life Sikander Khan belonged to the Gasho family of Chiktan. Born in 1917 he was the eldest son of Kacho Isfindyar Khan. His mother belonged to the family of the Raja Haider Khan of Tambis.There were no schools in his village so at the age of nine he was admitted to a school in the Kargil town so that he could get modern education. His father made him stay with a simple household, The Abaa pa of the Aba Grong, a small locality in the vicinity of Kargil town. When he was in the 9th standard, his father died, and he and his mother had to shoulder the responsibility of the family. After the death of his father he had to leave his education half way and had to return to his native village. He was then married to Roqiya Begum who belonged to the Wazir family of Pashkyum. Later he sttudied at the S.P College, Srinagar and then went to Amar Singh College, Srinagar. Career =As a public servant= In 1947 due to the turmoil that followed partition of the country he could not sit for his B.A exams. He came back to his village where he helped among others his brother Mehdi Ali Khan in keeping peace intact in the aftermath of the ongoing turmoil. Prior to that he got appointed as a teacher at Leh in 1940. He had a good command over the Urdu and Persian languages. In the late forties he gave up teaching after he was unable to return to Leh following winter vacation in his native village because of the occupation of Kargil by the Gilgit Scouts who had invaded the Ladakh region on behalf of Pakistan. Later, he joined the Kashmir Administrative Service and remained in government service for thirty-four years until his retirement. He served in the capacities of treasurer, Naib- Tehsildar and then became the Tehsildar. He was the Mohtamin-e-Bandobast at Srinagar and retired as an Assistant Commissioner in 1980 and returned to his village. =As a writer= His first book, an Urdu translation of a Ladakhi epic of \\"Nurboo Zangpo and Thoq Lhamo\\" came out in 1978. It was published with the help of the Jammu and Kashmir Cultural Academy. He was awarded for this book by the Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy. Grave of Kacho Sikander Khan at Zamstiang, Kargil His next book \\"Qadeem Ladakh - Tarikh-o-Tamaddun\\" (\\"Ladakh in the Mirror of her Folklore\\") came out in 1987. For this book he collected all the previous works done on the history of Ladakh and added a critical and well researched view of his own. He discusses the \\"Asaar-e-Qademaah\\", folk songs and \\"Dev Malas\\" with great details. The books' introduction reads, He followed it up with a study on Ladakh in the Mirror of Her Folklore in the year 1997 which, after a broad survey of Ladakhi culture, included English translations and transliterations into Roman script of 100 Ladakhi folksongs. His fourth book, Afkaar-e-Parishan, is an autobiography which also contains a number of Urdu poems. Sikandar Khan was pained by the erosion of Ladakh's traditional communal harmony, the deterioration of moral values and growing corruption in society. His autobiography sheds light on his views on these matters. He left one more text, Gachu Lha Brok,which is yet to be published. Gachu is the name of the broq (summer pasture) of Yokma Kharboo, the village where he spent his childhood. It has many features that are related to the epic Kesar Saga. Later years Later in his life he acted as the patron of the International Association for Ladakh Studies. Tashi Rabgias, a contemporary historian belonging to the neighboring Leh district, is now the only living patron after Sikander Khan's death.

The doll was conceived as an \\"average\\" alternative to Mattel's Barbie line, which has received controversy over its body image and proportions. Lamm created the toy using proportions of the average 19-year-old woman as indicated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (Petri). The name ‚ÄúLammily‚Äù was formed by combining his last name and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù.Preston-Sidler, Leandra A. Watch Me Disappear: Gendered Bodies, Pro-anorexia, and Self-injury in Virtual Communities. Diss. University of Central Florida Orlando, Florida, 2015. Development Lamm took inspiration for the doll from his high school experiences, when he felt self-conscious and had low self-esteem over his appearance. The idea for the doll line started from a series of concept renders using Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe Photoshop, comparing a Barbie doll to body proportions of a 19-year-old woman based on data from Centers for Disease Control. The new doll‚Äôs wrists, feet, hands, and knees were also designed to move and bend.http://digitalcommons.bryant.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1994&context;=archway Development of the doll was crowd sourced via Tilt.com, and in less than a day raised more than its $95,000. The funding campaign eventually raised $501,000 - more than five times the initial goal. Lamm's philosophy for the dolls is that ‚ÄúLammily represents the idea of being true to yourself in a world that too often convinces us to pursue an unattainable fantasy‚Äù and asks future supporters to join him ‚Äúin promoting the beauty of reality‚ÄùLamm, Nickolay. ‚ÄúThe Future of Lammily.‚Äù Lammily.

A boy Lammily doll was crowdfunded in 2016, and a Lammily wheelchair is now in development after a successful kickstarter campaign.https://lammily.com/ Marketing The first edition Lammily doll was marketed as \\"fit and strong\\" and has brown hair and little makeup. The Independent described her outfits as \\"toned-down\\", compared to Barbie's. The doll is articulated with jointed wrists, elbows, knees and ankles, enabling it to wear sneakers as well as high heel shoes. Backers of the crowdfunded campaign were given the opportunity to pre-order the doll prior to general release. The doll officially launched at the end of November 2014. Three Lammily dolls are now available: a white female doll, a black female doll, and a white male doll. The 'boy Lammily' doll was released in 2016 and said to be the first male fashion doll with realistic body proportions. There are additional outfits available for both the boy and girl Lammily dolls, many of which reflect careers, such as chef or firefighter. Unusually for a fashion doll, there is a 'Lammily Marks' pack available, featuring re-usable stickers showing marks including freckles, cellulite, grass stains, and wounds. There is also a Lammily Period Pack which includes a pair of pants and many colourful sanitary towels for the doll, accompanied by a book explaining menstruation to children. The Lammily doll was featured in an online advertising campaign called #DoYou, which shows Lammily excited to go on a vacation to Miami before being beset by beauty standards. Reception The doll has received praise in various media arenas penning her as a healthier and normal role model for the youth of which sets more realistic beauty standards. Demi Lovato described the doll as \\"awesome\\" on Twitter. It has been argued that Barbie dolls reflect highly sexualized image and circumscribe girl‚Äôs play by emphasizing prescribed roles and patterns of interaction. It is feared that by dramaticizing stereotypical feminine roles during play, girls will internalize and later embody such roles. This is one of the reasons Lammily was received as so refreshing.Kuther, Tara L., and Erin McDonald. \\"Early Adolescents' Experiences With, And Views Of, Barbie.\\"Adolescence 39.153 (2004): 39-51.

The film starred newcomer Hatty Jones as the titular character with Frances McDormand and Nigel Hawthorne in supporting roles as Miss Clavel and Lord Covington. The film encompasses the plots of four Madeline books. It was released on July 10, 1998 by TriStar Pictures. Plot In 1956 Paris, France, a young girl named Madeline attends a Catholic boarding school, taught by the strict but loving nun Miss Clavel and fed by the passionate French chef H√©l√®ne. Madeline is an orphan, coming from neither family nor money, but maintains a positive attitude and is best friends with another girl, Aggie. One night, Madeline is stricken with appendicitis and taken to the hospital, where Madeline undergoes an appendectomy. During her stay there, Madeline meets Lady Covington, the terminally ill wife of the school's board of trustees member, Lord Covington. Unlike her husband, Lady Covington cares deeply for the school and the girls, having attended the school herself in her youth. Lady Covington asks a favor of Madeline; she carved her birth name, Marie Gilbert, into one of the dorm's bed frames and she would like for Madeline to find out if her name is still there. Unfortunately, a few days later, when Madeline is ready to leave the hospital, she learns from Miss Clavel that Lady Covington has died. But, true to her promise, Madeline searches for her name under the beds, finding it under her own. After her hospital stay, Madeline finds that the Spanish ambassador has purchased the property next door to the school and that he also has a son, Pepito, who is around Madeline's age. While the other girls are smitten with Pepito, Madeline is irritated by the noise created by the boy riding around on his Vespa. Shortly after the ambassador's arrival, Lord Covington announces he plans on closing the school due to the death of his wife. Miss Clavel, unnerved by Pepito's bothering her girls, attempts to make peace with the boy by giving his tutor, Leopold, a tool box for him, in hopes that it will distract him from his obnoxious ways. However, her actions are unsuccessful as Pepito steals Madeline's drawing pad and write \\"Beware\\" with a vicious drawing in it before inviting the girls to his birthday party. During the party, Pepito unnerves his guests (except Madeline) by showing them a mouse and joking about killing it, either by feeding him to his snake or executing him using a guillotine he made using the tool box he'd received as a gift from Miss Clavel. Madeline, angered by Pepito's threats to harm the innocent and tiny animal, brutally attacks him and releases all of his mice, causing the guests to flee in horror and Miss Clavel to faint, which results in the girls' visit getting cut short, much to Pepito's amusement. On the way back to the school, Madeline takes Pepito's Vespa keys in an act of revenge. While out on a daily walk, Madeline accidentally falls into the Seine while standing on the ledge of a bridge going over the river. She is rescued by a stray dog, whom she names Genevieve, and emerges from the ordeal relatively unscathed, save for a cold. While sick in bed, Madeline is displeased to watch Leopold teach Pepito, frustrated over the loss of his keys, how to start his scooter with a paper clip. However, her anger disperses when she discovers that Genevieve has followed her to the school and convinces Miss Clavel who has dog allergies to let her golden haired savior live in the shed. Wanting to save the school Madeline forms an alliance with Pepito, enlisting his help to sabotage Lord Covington's attempts to sell the property but her efforts are ultimately discovered by Lord Covington, who initially blames Miss Clavel. Madeline takes responsibility for her involvement, though Lord Covington is unmoved by her apology or the motivation behind her actions when she makes a Freudian slip and calls him \\"Cucuface\\" and, after leaving, he turns Genevieve loose into the night in an act of retaliation against her and the girls. Upset over the loss of Genevieve, Miss Clavel takes the girls to a circus in hopes of cheering them up and Madeline, fearing she'll have no place to go as an orphan once the school closes, makes the decision to join the circus, hoping to make friends and find a home within the community there. After telling Aggie of her plans and making her swear not to tell, Madeline leaves the group and unintentionally stumbles upon Leopold, with the help of a trio of clowns known as \\"The Idiots,\\" kidnapping Pepito, hoping to hold him for ransom, and, while trying to intervene, is abducted as well. Luckily, Leopold and the Idiots leave the two children alone with a motorcycle, which Madeline uses her hair clip to start and convinces Pepito to drive, though he is initially reluctant as he drives a Vespa. The two are pursued by Leopold and the Idiots but Miss Clavel, having learned of Madeline's running away from Aggie, goes driving in search of her (finding and picking up Genevieve along the way) and, narrowly avoiding a collision with the two children on the bike, is able to cause the Idiots to crash into a lake. The police arrive and arrest the kidnappers, while Miss Clavel, Madeline, Pepito and Genevieve head back to the school. At the school, Lord Covington arrives and happily shares that he's sold the property to the ambassador of Uzbekistan. Madeline realises that Lord Covington is merely trying to sell the school. He at first dismisses her sympathy but Madeline speaks earnestly to Lord Covington about her own family being gone and says that Lady Covington is still with him and with the school and Miss Clavel, knowing Madeline is fearful of having no one if the school were to shut down, assures her that they'll be together, regardless of what happens. While Lord Covington is moved by Madeline's words and sincerity, he regretfully tells her and the girls that there's nothing he can do as he's already sold the property but, in a happy twist, the ambassador, also moved by Madeline, decides to back out of the sale. The film then concludes with a montage accompanied by Louis Armstrong's \\"What a Wonderful World\\", and changes back to a book setting, as the word, \\"Fin\\" appears. Frances McDormand in 2007 Cast ;Children ;Adults Production =Development and writing= While largely based on the original series, with storylines from three of the picture books weaved into the plot, several liberties were taken with the characters' backstories. Notably, Madeline is depicted as an orphan in the film, while in the books, she receives a dollhouse from her father and is known not only to have both her parents but siblings as well. The film's costume department went for some artistic licence in developing the costumes for Madeline. Aside from moving the time period from the 1930s to 1950, the producers elected for saturated blues and reds in the students' uniforms while keeping them as believable as possible, ruling out the possibility of using grey as it was seen as depressing. Similar considerations were made for Frances McDormand's character, a novice nun who, according to research, would have worn a short black habit; a softer blue habit similar to the one worn by Miss Clavel in the books was used instead. =Filming= Principal photography took place in Paris from September 1997 to January 1998, with English actress Hatty Jones, then 8 or 9 years, cast as the main character. Unlike the books, the film takes place in 1956, not 1939. Many of the landmarks from the books appear in the film, although some were too crowded with modern traffic to be used. Release and reception =Home video= Madeline was released on VHS, part of the Columbia TriStar Family Collection series, and DVD on December 15, 1998. =Critical response= This film received mixed to positive reviews upon release. It currently has a 63% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with an average score of 6.41/10. The site's consensus states: \\"It may be a tad tedious for older viewers, but Madeline's clever, adventurous heroine is likely to charm its intended audience.\\" On their TV show, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert awarded the film with \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" (see photo of film). Nell Minow of Common Sense Media said that the movie was \\"great for young kids and fans of the books.\\" AOL movie critic Brandon Judell said of it, \\"No horribly arch double entendres to draw in audiences who can't spend two hours in a theater without having their libido massaged.\\" Jeffery Huston called it \\"a disarming, charming fable so artfully crafted that adults will fall under its spell.\\" Conversely, John R. McEwen gave a negative review, stating that the movie was: \\"...Adequately simple for children, though perhaps a bit pedestrian for adults.\\" A similarly negative review was given by Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post, stating that \\"their 8-year-old daughters will less likely be impressed by the meandering story, dull visuals and flat characterizations.\\" Discrepancies The film depicts many events from the books, but there are a number of discrepancies from both the books and TV series as follows: * Madeline is depicted as a redhead in the series, whereas in the film she has light brown/strawberry blonde hair. * In the dining room where the breaking bread routine takes place, the girls are shown eating full dinners consisting of lamb and vegetables, but in the series, they are shown to eat croissants or bread rolls on a regular basis while breaking their bread. * There are also several name changes among the girls, with names sounding more British in origin, compared to more French in the TV series. They do not attempt French accents, unlike the TV series. * Lord Cucuface is renamed Lord Covington and his role is expanded. In the series, he appears to be merely a superintendent of sorts, while in the film, his grandmother-in-law opened the school and his late wife was a student and benefactress. Madeline still calls him Lord Cucuface both behind his back and on one occasion, directly to his face. He is not as na√Øve as he appears to be in the TV series either (example: believing that the girls could play instruments, but in reality they had only just recently discovered them in the attic). * Lord Covington is depicted as having a wife, but in the TV series, it is unclear if Lord Cucuface is married, divorced, a widower or a bachelor, let alone a father of children. * In the series, Lord Cucuface intended to sell the old house after it was deemed too old and too dangerous, although they soon had it repaired, whereas in the film, Lord Covington sells the old house after his wife's death. * In the movie, the girls and Pepito pull numerous pranks on the old house by unhinging doors, igniting firecrackers, leaving out stinky cheese and other things to dissuade Lord Covington from selling the school, but in the TV series, Lord Cucuface visited on a rainy day along with Madame Baguette and Madame Fromage; however, the old house was falling apart due to broken planks, a broken shutter, leaky roof, leaky taps and squeaky doors and after Madame Baguette had an accident when she slid down the banister and thus causing a large crash, Lord Cucuface announced that he was selling the old house because in his own words, it was \\"too old and too dangerous\\", despite the objections of the girls and Miss Clavel's suggestions of fixing it. * Pepito uses a guillotine to execute a mouse and proceeds to feed it to a snake for lunch, but in the TV series, he used the guillotine to decapitate poultry for eating in \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\". * Miss Clavel is portrayed as allergic to dogs, hence her sneezing, but in the TV series, she has nothing of the sort. * In the famous scene where Madeline accidentally falls into the Seine, she stands on the bridge to justify her actions towards Pepito at his birthday party to the girls when they are angry at her, but in \\"Madeline's Rescue\\", there was no animosity and in fact, she fell into the Seine out of careless tomfoolery. * The girls are portrayed as eating chicken and soon turning into vegetarians, but in the TV series, it was Pepito who ate chicken and subsequently became a vegetarian. * Pepito appears to be somewhat older than the girls and in place of a \\"hat\\" he drives a Vespa motorcycle. Unlike the TV series, where he reforms after one of his mischievous pranks goes wrong (involving a group of dogs and a cat), he appears to reform sometime during/after the scene where the girls pull various pranks at the old house. He also has a \\"tutor\\" in the film, who is absent in the series. * A lot of Pepito's mischief has been exaggerated, compared to the TV series. For instance, in the scene when the girls are in the kitchen and attempting to cook themselves, he wears a hideous red demon mask and frightens all of the girls, making some of them scream, but in \\"Madeline at Cooking School\\", he helped the girls to cook lunch for Lord Cucuface, because Mrs. Murphy, the usual cook/housekeeper, had fallen ill due to the flu. * Pepito frightened the girls in the form of a white ghost on a hot summer night when they were toasting marshmallows around a campfire in \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\". * In the scene of Pepito's birthday party, the girls' visit is cut short when Madeline releases the mice from a cage in Pepito's menagerie and everything erupts into chaos, including a physical fight between Madeline and Pepito, forcing Miss Clavel to make them leave without having any birthday cake and write out \\"I will control my temper\\" a number of times as punishment, but that never happened in the TV series at all: in the episode Madeline in London, Madeline, Miss Clavel and the girls visited Pepito in London after he had moved there with his parents and they celebrated his birthday in a celebratory way, had a large party consisting of a large cake and many treats and they gave him a retired horse as a birthday present, whom he named Piccadilly, perhaps after the London street of the same name. * In the film, Madeline is a lot more outgoing, confident and somewhat of a leader, compared to her slightly more demure character in the series. She is also given a different backstory, where she is made an orphan, while the original books and TV series provides her with parents, notably in the eponymous pilot episode and Madeline's Christmas. The scene with the girls in the hospital room visiting Madeline makes this clear: in the book and aforementioned pilot episode, she has a dollhouse from \\"Papa\\", but in the film, Vicki explains that the toys are for \\"charity cases\\". Madeline: Lost in Paris re-establishes her as an orphan in the series. * Genevieve in the book/TV series is depicted as a chocolate- brown mongrel, while the film appears to have her as a Golden/Labrador Retriever mix with a whitish-blonde coloring. * While the TV series is somewhat unclear on whether Miss Clavel is a nun, nurse, boarding house \\"mother\\" or similar (she is neither called Sister nor Mother Clavel), the movie does make it quite clear that she is a nun. She also appears to have a soft spot for Madeline, treating her like her own daughter. Unlike her wholly optimistic TV counterpart, the film version does display signs of realism (and allows Madeline some leverage). * The cook is Mrs. Murphy in the series, but renamed Helene in the film. * The movie was banned in Russia until 2008 because Leopold, Pepito's tutor, was a Soviet Spy trying to kidnap Pepito to get money and to make Spain a Communist country. * The pilot episode of the TV series does not specify if or when Madeline was released from the hospital, but the movie depicts her as being released from the hospital and taken home to the vine-covered old house by Miss Clavel and Helene, just as the Spanish Ambassador moves in next door, an event that did not occur until \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\". * Dr. Cohn, the physician in the TV series, was replaced by a pair of orderlies and a stretcher to pick up Madeline when she had appendicitis. * When Miss Clavel and the girls go to the funfair, which ends with in a thunderstorm and thus forcing them to go back to the old house, Madeline runs away to join the circus, only to get kidnapped along with Pepito by two clowns and Leopold, but in the TV series, Madeline and Pepito were unintentionally left behind on the ferris wheel in the rain and they were well looked after by the gypsies and the circus performers. * Miss Clavel is more confident in driving a car, whereas in the episode Madeline and the Big Cheese, she is not a confident driver. * When the girls are visiting the famous Louvre, they are seen with sketch pads and Madeline retrieves her pad from Pepito, only to see hideous drawings and a threatening message \\"BEWARE!\\", but in the TV series, they visited the Louvre after Madeline had painted a picture of the old house and the workers at the gallery claimed it as their own after she accidentally left it behind - Pepito was not even present in that episode. * Detective Moreau was replaced by some policemen when they came to arrest Leopold and the other culprits who abducted Pepito and Madeline from the circus. * In the pilot, Miss Clavel did not ride in the ambulance that took Madeline to the hospital; instead, she stayed back with the remaining eleven girls.

Founded in 2000, the company has four data centers throughout the New York Metropolitan Area located in Wappingers Falls, New York; Totowa, New Jersey; Stamford, Connecticut and Norwalk, Connecticut. Cervalis' Norwalk facility is notable for being the largest data center in the State of Connecticut. All of Cervalis' data centers are Tier III compliant. History Cervalis was officially founded on April 4, 2000 by Michael A. Boccardi, Robert Carlson, and Robert Crespi. The name Cervalis was chosen as a portmanteau for \\"Serve All Information Systems\\", stylized with a C rather than an S. Cervalis' first location was in Cheshire, Connecticut, where it was headquartered for a six-month period before moving to Bedford Street in Stamford, Connecticut. Its first data center was opened in a former IBM facility on May 30, 2001, in Wappingers Falls, New York. Governor George Pataki was in attendance at the opening and helped cut the ribbon to the facility, which he touted as a prime example of how his tax incentives helped to grow the tech industry: \\"New York State is proud to welcome Cervalis to one of the fastest growing regional economies in the nation - the Hudson Valley Region. As a result of the $100 billion in tax cuts we've enacted and our aggressive efforts to foster the growth of technology-based firms, more and more companies like Cervalis are making the smart decision to invest and grow right here in New York.‚Äù Cervalis' Norwalk facility, Connecticut's largest data center. In 2007, Cervalis had two major changes: Its second data center, totaling 40,000 square feet, was opened in Stamford, Connecticut; the company subsequently moved from Bedford Street in Stamford to Armstrong Road in Shelton, Connecticut, in a business park formerly occupied by Black & Decker. In 2010, the company opened up its third facility, totaling 182,000 square feet, in Totowa, New Jersey, in a strategic location less than 20 miles from New York City and easily accessible by both Interstate 80 and the NJ Transit Montclair-Boonton Line. In December 2013, the company opened its fourth data- center, located in Norwalk, Connecticut. The new facility totals over 168,000 square feet, making it the largest data center in the State of Connecticut. In 2014, the Cervalis headquarters moved from its Shelton location to offices in this facility to obtain a more centralized location to each of its four facilities, and to better accommodate clientele in the New York Metropolitan Area, easily accessed using the Connecticut Turnpike and the Metro-North New Haven Line. The new facility was built on a site in Norwalk with unique attributes: Besides being located above the 500 year flood plain (an attribute present in all Cervalis facilities), the site straddles the electrical jurisdiction of both Connecticut Light and Power and the Norwalk Third Taxing District Electrical Department, allowing the facility to be dual-powered by two independent electrical companies; offering a greater level of redundancy than the average data center. In July 2015, Cervalis was acquired by CyrusOne, expanding CyrusOne's footprint into the Northeast.

Career  Anavaj Sakuntabhai began his career as a medical doctor, graduating in 1987. He obtained his PhD in human molecular genetics from the University of Oxford in 1999. In 2000 he joined the Institut Pasteur as a senior scientist and in 2007 became the leader of the laboratory of Genetics of Human Response to Infections. In 2010 he created and became a head of the Functional Genetics of Infectious Diseases Unit. For several years, he was a principal investigator of one of the four consortial projects of the MalariaGEN consortium, a global community of researchers working together to integrate epidemiology with genome science financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He is a partner of a Wellcome Trust financed project on the human genome wide screening for dengue susceptible genes. His laboratory is a principal investigator of a French initiative to tackle the disease burden under changing environments. He is a coordinator of the European FP7 project on Dengue Framework for Resisting Epidemics in Europe (DENFREE). The project aims to find key factors determining dengue transmission and dengue epidemics in order to develop new tools and strategies for controlling dengue transmission. The project also estimates the risk of spreading DENV to uninfected areas, especially in Southern Europe where susceptible vectors exist. Sakuntabhai coordinates a global network for dengue research in the Institut Pasteur International Network.  Research  In 1999 Sakuntabhai discovered a gene responsible for Darrier disease, a monogenic skin disorder. In 2005 he discovered a variant on a promoter of DC-SIGN associated with gene expression and outcome of dengue infection. Since its discovery this variant has been shown to be associated with other infectious diseases including tuberculosis and HIV, amongst others. It has been confirmed in a replicated study. In 2009, together with other researchers, he participated in the finding of positive selection of G6PD (glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) and its effect on Plasmodium vivax (one of the six species of malaria parasites that commonly infect humans) density. The work challenges the former belief that G6PD mutations were selected by P. falciparum and highlights the significant effect of P. vivax on human health, one hitherto neglected. His recent research has shown that both gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions play a significant role in susceptibility to malaria and dengue.

It was originally printed by Stephen Bukley in 1643, and is well known for its opening lines: \\"OH the distraction of this Factious age! / Have not wile-men (who are starke mad with rage, / Brought this faire Land to such a combustion, / That through their means we may feare confusion.\\". Synopsis Tis A Plaine Case Gentlemen is, at its core, a royalist broadside ballad. It decries the current (1643) political and religious state of London. The speaker asserts that London's current woes are brought on by both religious division and the peoples' lack of faith in their king and parliament. Though the protestant reformation was nearing its end, it was still a considerable driving force in political and religious thought. The ballad claims that the common folk, as opposed to the king and parliament, are responsible for their own troubles because each private individual is taking on the mantle of king for themselves, which is blasphemous in the eyes of God and ignores the Great Chain of Being that many royalist supporters believed in. The ballad concludes by claiming that those who harm their sovereign in turn harm themselves.

The more natural phrase \\"believe in him\\" is used by the New American Standard Bible.: NASB =Verse 5= :When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. KJV =Verse 14= : Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so (i.e. attempted to heal using the name of the Lord Jesus). NKJV Sceva () was a Jew called a \\"chief priest\\" (). Some scholars note that it was not uncommon for some members of the Zadokite clan to take on an unofficial high-priestly role, which may explain this moniker. However, it is more likely that he was an itinerant exorcist based on the use of the Greek term () \\"going from place to place\\" in . In this verse, it is recorded that he had seven sons who attempted to exorcise a demon from a man in Ephesus by using the name of Jesus as an invocation. This practice is similar to the Jewish practice, originating in the Testament of Solomon, of invoking Angels to cast out demons. Sorcery and exorcism are mentioned several times in Acts: Simon Magus and Elymas Bar-Jesus, and divination is illustrated by the girl at Philippi. \\"She was regarded as spirit-possessed, and it was the spirit who was addressed and expelled by Paul in \\".Magic and Sorcery, Encyclopedia of the Bible, accessed 6 October 2015 =Verse 15= : And the evil spirit answered and said, ‚ÄúJesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?‚Äù NKJV This evil spirit had heard of both Jesus and Paul, but not of the seven sons of Sceva, which soon received 'such a beating' from the spirit 'that they ran' (); theologian Conrad Gempf argues that this shows that power over evil spirits does not work in a mechanical way in the name of Jesus, but because one knows Jesus and, more importantly, is known by him. = Verse 19 = :Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver. NKJV *\\"50,000 pieces of silver\\": or \\"50,000 drachmas\\" (1 drachma represents the average wage for a day) representing over 135 years' wages. =Verse 21= :When these things were accomplished, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, \\"After I have been there, I must also see Rome\\". NKJV Paul has already intended to have his trip to Jerusalem followed with a trip to Rome. The riot in Ephesus (19:23‚Äì45) The amount of money in the scroll-burning incident (19:19) must have stirred many people, whole livelihood (that is dependent on the selling of religious objects) is threatened by the successful growth of the Christian church, and now is bolstering a serious opposition. =Verse 29= :So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's travel companions. NKJV *\\"Aristarchus\\": One of Paul's travel companions, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, who is known from some references in the Acts of the Apostles (19:29; 20:4; 27:2) and Colossians 4:10. =Verse 33= :And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people.

He was bronze medallist at the 2015 Pan American Games. Career Born in Fortaleza, Perrier was adopted by a French couple when he was one year old. He does not know his biological parents and did not learn Portuguese as a child. He first played football and basketball, but had to give up because of his asthma. He turned to fencing rather against his will, but the sport gradually grew on him. Perrier was formed at Escrime Angoul√™me under the coaching of Beno√Æt Gonsseaume and Jean-Loup Boulanger. He was selected into the French national team for the 2006 Junior European Championships in Pozna≈Ñ, where they earned a bronze medal, and for the 2006 Junior World Championships, where they took a silver medal. Perrier then joined INSEP, a state-sponsored centre for high-performance athletes. He took part in the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade and won a bronze medal in the team event. He finished second in the 2013 French national championships after being defeated by Erwann Le P√©choux. After the 2012‚Äì13 season Perrier was recruited by the Brazilian Fencing Federation to fence for the Brazilian national team under a new rule allowing for the calling of athletes under other criteria than national rankings. His recruitment, along with that of foreign-born athletes in other sports, was understood by the press as an attempt to support Olympic medals expectations in sports where Brazil has little tradition and raised comparisons to the \\"Plastic Brit\\" phenomenon. In the 2013‚Äì14 season Perrier won a bronze medal in the satellite tournaments of Amsterdam and London. He climbed his first World Cup podium with a bronze medal in Seoul, defeating along the way Olympic team champions Giorgio Avola and Valerio Aspromonte. He reached the quarter-finals in the Pan American Championships, but was defeated by Gerek Meinhardt of the United States. At the World Championships in Kazan Perrier lost in the second round to reigning European champion James-Andrew Davis of Great Britain. In the team event Brazil prevailed over the Czech Republic in the first round, then were crushed by Italy and finished 17th. Perrier ended the season No.26 in world rankings, a career best so far. The 2014‚Äì15 season was a difficult one for Perrier, who never managed to pass the first round in a World Cup event and stopped at the quarter-finals at the 2015 Pan American Championships. He bounced back at the 2015 Pan American Games by reaching the semi-finals. He was defeated by the USA's Gerek Meinhardt and came away with a bronze medal.

Dronningm√∏lle is located four kilometers west of Hornb√¶k, six kilometers east of Gilleleje and 22 kilometers north of Hiller√∏d. The town is served by Dronningm√∏lle Station on the Hornb√¶k Line. Since 2010 Dronningm√∏lle has grown together with its neighbour Hornb√¶k in Helsing√∏r Municipality to form an urban area with a combined population of 5,283 as of 2019. Hornb√¶k proper had a population of 3,608 with Dronningm√∏lle having 1,675. History The name Dronningm√∏lle, literally \\"queen's mill\\", comes from a water mill located close to the point where the stream Esrum √Ö runs into the Kattegat. The first water mill at the site was built by monks from Esrum Abbey. In 1588, it was replaced by a new water mill which was commissioned by Frederick II of Denmark and named after his wife, Queen Sophie, possibly because she owned the site on which it was built. Valentin von Spangenberg, who also worked on Kronborg Castle and many other road and mill projects in the area, was charged with the construction of the complex. The nearest settlements were Villinger√∏d and Villingeb√¶k which are both mentioned in documents from the early days of Esrum Abbey. Located a couple of kilometres inland, Villinger√∏d, literally \\"The forest dwellers' clearing\\", was with its 10 farms the largest village in Esb√∏nderup parish. Villingeb√¶k, literally \\"The forest dwellers' stream\\", a reference to the location at Pandehave √Ö, consisted of a mixture of fishermen's houses and small farmsteads. It prospered from the fishing of herring in the 16th century but was hit hard by sand drift in the 17th and 18th century. Since the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to its sandy beach, the locality has been a popular resort with hotels and guest houses along the coast road. Today, it has some 1,500 summerhouses reaching up to two kilometres inland. Until 1946, Kasseg√•rd, a large thatched house had stood for centuries on the corner of Villinger√∏dvej and Linde Alle. Dronningm√∏lle Station on the Helsing√∏r-Gilleleje line was initially opened to serve Dronningm√∏lle Teglverk, a brick factory established in 1898 by the coffee merchant Ferdinand Andersen. For a time, the local fishermen were opposed to the growing importance of the factory but, as Andersen bought up most of the area, they were eventually forced to work there. The brickyard was closed in 1947 and subsequently demolished. Landmarks Munkeruphus Dronningm√∏lle water mill was rebuilt in the National Romantic style for Ferdinand Andersen and is now known as Dronningm√∏lle Slot. The building has later been converted into holiday apartments. Ferdinand Andersen is also associated with other buildings in the area, such as the beach house Skansen which he constructed at the mouth of Esrum √Ö in 1899. The house takes its name after a protected defensive structure located on the estate. The now wingless wind mill next to the water mill was built in 1878 and remained in use until 1934. Dronningm√∏lle Avlsg√•rd from 1923 was designed by the architect Henning Hansen. The Rudolph Tegner Museum Munkeruphus (Munkerup House), a residence inspired by American Colonial Revival architecture, is located in Dronningm√∏lle. It is now an exhibition centre. The Rudolph Tegner Museum, just south of Dronningm√∏lle, is dedicated to the work of the sculptor Rudolph Tegner who designed the building himself in a bunker-like Modernist style. Villinger√∏d Church Villinger√∏d Church, located on the west side of the road between Villinger√∏d and Dronningm√∏lle, close to the Rudolph Tegner Museum, is from 1906.

BENTA stands for \\"B cell expansion with NF-Œ∫B and T cell anergy\\" and is caused by germline heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the gene CARD11 (see OMIM entry #607210). This disorder is characterized by polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis with onset in infancy, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, mild immunodeficiency, and increased risk of lymphoma. Investigators Andrew L. Snow and Michael J. Lenardo at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the U.S. National Institutes of Health first characterized BENTA disease in 2012. Dr. Snow's current laboratory at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences is now actively studying this disorder.  Presentation  Individuals with BENTA disease have polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis (i.e. excess B cells) developing in infancy, in addition to splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Patients may have low serum IgM and mildly anergic T cells. These features likely contribute to the mild immunodeficiency seen with BENTA disease. Patients are generally susceptible to recurrent sinopulmonary and ear infections in childhood, and may be more susceptible to certain viruses including Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, and molluscum contagiosum.  Genetics  Representation of the CARD11 protein showing the general domain structure and two different gain-of-function missense mutations associated with BENTA disease located just upstream of the coiled-coil (CC) domain BENTA disease is caused by germline-encoded gain-of-function mutations in the gene CARD11. This is a 138 kB gene mapping to chromosome 7p22 with 26 exons encoding a 1,154 amino acid protein. The CARD11 protein (also known as CARMA1) is a scaffolding protein required for NF-Œ∫B activation in both B and T lymphocytes. Gain-of- function mutations drive constitutive NF-Œ∫B activation in both types of cells. Most mutations are localized within or just upstream of the coiled-coil domain (exons 4-9) of the protein. Patient phenotypes also suggest that B cell differentiation might be partially impaired in BENTA disease, contributing to a low percentage of class-switched and memory B cells. Germline gain-of- function mutations in CARD11 manifest a less severe illness than loss-of- function mutations seen in CARD11 deficiency (OMIM #615206), an autosomal recessive condition manifesting in severe combined immunodeficiency. The gain- of-function CARD11 mutations associated with BENTA disease may also predispose patients to B cell malignancy. Importantly, overactive NF-Œ∫B is frequently associated with B cell malignancy and, specifically, somatic gain-of-function CARD11 mutations are seen frequently in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, most BENTA patients present with polyclonal B cell accumulation with no evidence of oligoclonal or monoclonal populations (i.e. malignancy). These mutations do not appear to be associated with T cell malignancies. = Inheritance = This disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal refers to the fact that every person has two CARD11 alleles, one inherited from each parent. This is in contrast to sex-linked chromosomes. Dominant means that the abnormal allele dominates the matching, normal allele. Only one of the two copies (alleles) of CARD11 needs to be abnormal for a person to have BENTA disease. BENTA disease can also arise spontaneously in a patient as the result of a de novo mutations in CARD11, which means that the mutation was not inherited from the parents. In this case the patient could still pass on the mutation to his/her children. Children of a parent who carries a CARD11 mutation have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. In a family, each child‚Äôs risk of inheriting the mutated CARD11 allele is independent of whether or not other siblings inherited the mutation. For example, if the first four children in a family have the mutation, the next child has the same 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Children who do not inherit the mutation will not develop BENTA disease nor pass it on to their children.  Diagnosis The majority of patient peripheral blood mononucleated cells are polyclonal na√Øve mature B cells, with a significant increase in immature, transitional B cell numbers (identified as CD10+). Percentages of circulating class-switched and memory B cells are very low, and in vitro studies show poor B cell differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion. Serum IgM is low in most patients, while total IgG and IgA may be on the low end of normal. Patients demonstrate defective antibody production against T cell-independent, polysaccharide-based vaccines. Some patients may not mount protective antibody titers to other vaccines, such as measles and varicella zoster virus. T cell counts are generally within or just above the normal range. In vitro stimulation of T cells demonstrates that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are less responsive than normal, suggesting mild T cell anergy in patients. A diagnosis of leukemia can generally be ruled out in these patients based on the unremarkable appearance of small resting lymphocytes in the blood; however, patients must be closely monitored for any signs of monoclonal or oligoclonal B cell expansion because there may be an increased risk for B cell malignancy. Specifically, one patient with BENTA disease was reported as having developed B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) as an adult.  Treatment  There is currently minimal therapeutic intervention available for BENTA disease. Patients are closely monitored for infections and for signs of monoclonal or oligoclonal B cell expansion that could indicate B cell malignancy. Splenectomy is unlikely to reduce B cell burden; peripheral blood B cell counts rose significantly in three patients who underwent the procedure. It remains to be determined whether immunosuppressive drugs, including B cell-depleting drugs such as rituximab, could be effective for treating BENTA disease.

Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text Originally written in Koine Greek, this chapter is divided into 38 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 11‚Äì38) * Codex Laudianus (~550) Locations This chapter mentions the following places (in order of appearance): * Macedonia * Greece * Syria * Berea * Asia (Roman province) * Thessalonica * Derbe * Philippi * Troas * Assos * Mitylene * Chios * Samos * Trogyllium * Miletus * Ephesus * Jerusalem Journey to Troas via Macedonia (20:1‚Äì6) This section records the beginning of the journey planned in , as Paul was accompanied by brothers from almost all the mission areas: Sopater (cf. (probably) ), Tychicus (; ; ; ), Aristarchus and Gaius (; cf. , ). =Verse 4= :And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. KJV *\\"Aristarchus\\": One of Paul's travel companions, a Macedonian from Thessalonica who is known from some references in the Acts of the Apostles (19:29; 20:4; 27:2) and Colossians 4:10. *\\"Timotheus\\" or \\"Timothy\\" (NKJV). *\\"Tychicus\\": traveled with Paul on his third missionary journey (; ; ; Titus 3:12). *Tychicus and Trophimus are called Asianoi (\\"of Asia\\"), that is, natives of the Roman province of Asia. Making it still more definite, Trophimus is also termed an \\"Ephesian\\" and a \\"Gentile/Greek\\" in Acts 21. In Troas (20:7‚Äì12) The believers in Troas (cf. ) had a \\"meeting\\" on the first day of the week (verse 7; cf. Acts 2:42), which started on Saturday night (at that time, Sunday was a working day, so the practice was to gather on Saturday night or early on Sunday morning as noted by Pliny, Ep. 10.96.7), perhaps after work for some people, including Eutychus, which is a common slave name. It comprised a long teaching session by Paul (verse 7), 'breaking of bread' and a communal meal (verse 11), then finished at dawn. =Verse 9= : And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. NKJV Eutychus was a young man of (Alexandria) Troas tended to by St. Paul. The name Eutychus means \\"fortunate\\". Eutychus fell asleep due to the long nature of the discourse Paul was giving and fell from his seat out of a three story window.Arndt, William & Gingrich, F. W. (1967), Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (University of Chicago Press). Paul's immediate action to resurrect Euthycus (verse 10) recalls the miracles of Elijah and Elisha (1 Kings 17:21‚Äî22; 2 Kings 4:34‚Äî35). The term \\"dead\\" (Greek: nekros) is used to emphasize that this is to be seen as a real miracle (verse 10). *\\"Third story\\": this indicates a 'working-class insula or apartment block', not the atrium of a villa or town house. =Verse 10= Paul raiseth Eutychus to life, from Figures de la Bible, 1728. : But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, \\"Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him.\\" NKJV After Eutychus fell down to his death, Paul then picked him up, insisting that he was not dead, and carried him back upstairs; those gathered then had a meal and a long conversation which lasted until dawn. After Paul left, Eutychus was found to be alive. It is unclear whether the story intends to relate that Eutychus was killed by the fall and Paul raised him, or whether he simply seemed to be dead, with Paul ensuring that he is still alive. =Verse 12= : And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted. NKJV Journey from Troas to Miletus (20:13‚Äì17) Satellite view of Chios island (NASA) Satellite 3D view of Samos island (NASA) Paul's journey through the northern Aegean Sea is detailed in verses 13 to 16. The text states that Paul, having left Philiipi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, had a desire urgently to travel to Jerusalem and needed to be there by the Day of Pentecost, even choosing to avoid returning to Ephesus and being delayed there. As there are fifty days from the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover) to Pentecost, and five days were taken on travel from Philippi to Troas and seven days spent waiting in Troas, Paul and his party had around 38 days available for travel to Jerusalem. Paul appears to have made the arrangements to charter a ship, but Luke and his companions began the journey from Troas and sailed around Cape Baba to Assos. Paul travelled overland from Troas to Assos and embarked there. The ship sailed southwards to Lesbos, calling at Mitylene, then passed Chios and arrived at Samos, staying at Trogyllium. They passed Ephesus and came into port at Miletus, calling for the elders of the church in Ephesus to travel to Miletus for a meeting. KJV The elders of the church (, tous presbyterous tes ekklesias) were also referred to as overseers (, episkopous) in verse 28. Miletus is about 40 miles south of Ephesus. The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary noted that in view of Paul's haste, more time might have been lost in calling for the elders to come from Ephesus than would have been lost if Paul had actually gone to Ephesus himself, but surmised that either his decision was made because of 'unfavorable winds and stormy weather [which] had overtaken them' or 'he was unwilling to run the risk of detention at Ephesus by the state of the church and other causes'.Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Acts 20, accessed 14 October 2015 Paul's speech to the Ephesian elders (20:18‚Äì38) This section records the only direct speech of Paul to Christian believers in the book of Acts, thus the only passage strictly parallels the epistles (cf. Philippians 3; 2 Timothy 3‚Äì4; Romans 15, and the autobiographical sections in 2 Corinthians 10-12. =Verse 24= : [Paul said:] \\"But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.\\" NKJV =Verse 28= : [Paul said:] ‚ÄúTake heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.‚Äù KJV * \\"Take heed...unto yourselves\\" (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ≠œáŒµœÑŒµ ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑŒø·øñœÇ, ) Peculiar to Luke's writings (; ; ; ).The Pulpit Commentary, edited by H.D.M.

The pastor is to feed the flock of Christ (see ; ; ; ). St. Peter applies the titles of \\"Shepherd and Bishop of souls\\" to the Lord Jesus (). St. Paul does not use the metaphor elsewhere, except indirectly, and in a different aspect (). * \\"Church of God\\" (, tou Theou). Textus Receptus has œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶, but most uncials have œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ (\\"of [the] Lord\\"). Meyer thinks that the external evidence for œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ is decisive, and that the internal evidence from the fact that ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ occurs nowhere else in Paul's writings, is decisive also. On the other hand, both the Codex Vaticanus (B; 03) and the Codex Sinaiticus (; 01), the two oldest manuscripts, have ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶ (ŒòœÖ), as well as the Vulgate and the Syriac; also the early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, \\"the blood of God,\\" which seems to have been derived from this passage. Alford reasons powerfully in favor of ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶, dwelling upon the fact that the phrase ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶ occurs ten times in Pauline epistles, that of ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ not once. The chief authorities on each side of the question are: :(1) in favor of , Lachmann, Tischendorf, Bornemann, Lunge, Olshausen, Davidson, Meyer, Hackett, as also Grotius, Griesbaeh (doubtfully), Wetstein, Le Clerc, and others; :(2) in favor of , Bengel, Mill, Whitby, Wolf, Scholz, Knapp, Alford, Wordsworth, etc., and Textus Receptus. It should be added that the evidence for has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf of the Codex Sinaiticus in 1863,, and of the Codex Vaticanus in 1867, from his own collation. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, \\"the blood of God,\\" and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct \\"blood of God,\\" which Athanasius and others objected to. =Verse 35= : [Paul said:] \\"I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\\" NKJV This verse is unusual in that it records a saying of Jesus that did not come to be recorded in any of the gospels.Asimov's Guide to the Bible: The New Testament, p. 413. In his homily on the Acts of the Apostles, John Chrysostom says, \\"And where said He this?

History In 1927, the people of Bingham County started planning to build a community hospital. On 19 August 1950, after extensive planning and 23 years of fund raising, the 60-bed hospital was opened. The funds included those under the Hill‚ÄìBurton Act, and the total cost was $537,000. At that time it was a county general hospital; on 1 July 2007, it was turned into a non-profit (c)3 health care unit. The Bingham Health care foundation is responsible for the collection and raise of funds for BMH. Its independent non-profit organization status makes it able to apply for federal and private funding and resources. The money is raised through individual or public donations, grant writing, employee payroll deduction program, annual mass mailing and special events. Facilities The hospital has grown from a 60 beds health care unit to a medical facility with over 500 employees. The hospital treats almost 1500 patients every year. An average of 2400 operations are conducted at BMH each year and 18,000 medical procedures are successfully administered. According to the well maintained hospital records, 8700 people were admitted in the emergency room last year. The hospital is constantly growing and its impact in the region is commendable. The hospital started with a staff of only six doctors. Today, it has a team of over 100 physicians, along with several facilities and specialized departments. The hospital specializes in: * Cardiology * Dermatology * Orthopaedics * Diabetes Care * Endocrinology * Family Medicine * Mental Health and Nephrology * Neurology and Neuro Surgery * Rural Health * Oncology * Pain relief * Plastic Surgery * Sports Medicine * Pulmonology * Podiatry. Partnerships Bingham Memorial Hospital (BMH) has entered into partnership with several other institutions to enhance their own workforce and capabilities. They include: * 1st choice urgent care. * Idaho Doctor‚Äôs Hospital. * Bingham Cardiology and Dermatology * Idaho Neurosciences Centre, Kidney Centre, Pain Group, Physician‚Äôs Clinic. * Bingham Memorial Surgical Team, Medicine Team, Women‚Äôs health care centre. * Blackfoot Orthopaedic centre etc. Hospital rating data The HealthGrades website contains the latest quality data for Bingham Memorial Hospital, as of 2015. For this rating section three different types of data from HealthGrades are presented: quality ratings for nine inpatient conditions and procedures, thirteen patient safety indicators, percentage of patients giving the hospital a 9 or 10 (the two highest possible ratings).

Scientific career Sanberg's research has focused on the functions of the human brain, the causes of its deterioration, and treatments for mental disorders. He is a spokesperson for breakthrough treatments in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, and trauma. =Nicotine research= In 2000, Sanberg and fellow scientist Archie Silver conducted a study of the effects of nicotine patches on Tourette's victims. The study involved seventy young people with Tourette's. Those who were administered the nicotine patch along with Haldol showed significantly increased muscle control and ability to desist from verbal outbursts. The study suggests that nicotine and its analogues could also be used to treat the symptoms of mental disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.Hayden, Thomas. 2000. \\"A Little Nicotine Could Be Good for You.\\" Newsweek 135, no. 10: 53.

A member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Khetcho led an active life in Armenian politic affairs. During his time as an activist, he participated in the Khanasor Expedition, an offensive by Armenian fedayees against the Kurdish Mazrik tribe on July 25, 1897. He was also a key supporter of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. In 1915, during a skirmish between Turkish forces near Bitlis, he was killed in action. Early life Khetcho was born Khachadur Amirian in 1872 in Nakhichevan which was then part of the Russian Empire. His father was a local priest. He studied in Shushi at the local Diocese School. Khetcho goes on to become a trainer of Armenian revolutionary fighters who were mainly stationed in the Caucasus. Khanasor Expedition Keri, Yeprem Khan, and Khetcho In 1896, during the aftermath of the Defense of Van, the Mazrik tribe had ambushed many of the Armenian defenders of Van as they were retreating into Persia. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation decided to retaliate, resulting in the Khanasor Expedition. Khetcho departed from Persia and participated in the expedition which became his first armed combat mission. During the mission, Khetcho met Yeprem Khan, another Armenian Revolutionary who Khetcho eventually collaborated with during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Armeno-Tatar clashes Thereafter, during the Armenian‚ÄìTatar massacres of 1905‚Äì07, Khetcho participated in the defense of Armenians throughout the Caucasus. During his participation, he was assistant to Nikol Duman, an Armenian fedayee from Karabakh. He was in charge of defending Armenian villages that were situated next to the Arax river. Iranian Constitutional Revolution During the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, Khetcho fought the anti-constitutionalists alongside Yeprem Khan and Keri from 1908‚Äì10. Khetcho's unit spearheaded the monarchist's army becoming a viable force within its ranks. In 1910, while in battle, Khetcho's jawbone was shattered by a bullet. Thereafter, he was forced to settle in Switzerland. World War I Dro Khetcho on horseback In the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì13, the Ottoman Empire had lost its Balkan possessions to Christian uprisings, intensifying fears in the Turkish homeland that the Empire's increasingly restive Armenian Christian minority--with the assistance or encouragement of Western governments--might also attempt to establish an independent state, resulting in the breakup of Turkey itself. \\\\- Profile at Google Books Distrust and suspicion of Armenians reached a peak following the outbreak of World War I, when a successful advance of Russian troops across the Turkish border into the heavily Armenian-populated vilayet of Van in early 1915 was blamed on Armenian disloyalty, leading the Turkish government to adopt a set of extreme measures which would culminate in the Armenian genocide. 1914, Members of the Armenian volunteer units; Armen Garo, Khetcho, and Drastamat Kanayan Prior to the start of World War I, Khetcho participated in the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Council meeting in Berlin. Khetcho was then tasked to acquire armaments in order to support self-defense efforts. At the start of the war, he was one of the five Armenian legions formed to enter Ottoman territory forming the Armenian volunteer units under Russian command. During the Van Resistance, Khetcho's unit was among the first to enter and liberate it on May 5, 1915. This was followed by the Russian armies occupation of the city a few days later. Death After Van was liberated, Khetcho and his squadron were assigned to assist self-defense efforts in Mush and Sassoun. In July 1915, Khetcho stopped in Bitlis, where in June 1915, during the Armenian Genocide, Turks and Kurds, led by Jevdet Bey, were known to have massacred 15,000 Armenians.Walker, Christopher J. \\"The End of Armenian Taron and Baghesh, 1914-1916\\" in Armenian Baghesh/Bitlis and Taron/Mush, pp. 191-206. In preparation for a Russian advance, the Turkish forces mounted their artillery atop a mountain with a clear path to launch a renewed offensive onto the village. Fearing an impending massacre upon the Armenian population of the village, Khetcho and his regiment led a cavalry offensive against the Turkish army pushing them higher up the mountain. However, during a counter-attack by Turkish forces, Khetcho was fatally wounded. His body was taken to Van where he was ultimately buried next to other Armenian revolutionaries.

Background  Having subdued much of Khorasan, Nader intended to push further south and secure Sangan Khaf as well as Behdadin. These two cities were easily subdued, however their appeal of help reached the south with an Abdali force of 20,000 marching up to answer the call to arms. The Abdalis in Sangan Khaf revolted against the Persians and awaited the relief force but were overcome rapidly when Nader reacted swiftly sending a body of cavalry to seize one of the entrances to the City after which the city was ransacked. The battle The arrival of the Abdali relief force had come too late but they were determined to give battle drawing up their men for the charge. The bulk of Nader's forces were under his own command with his person in the centre of the formation as well as a separate contingent which included 2,000 musketeers under Tahmasp's command. the ensuing battle was fiercely contested and at one point a flank of Nader's army began to give way when it was rescued by the addition of a 1,000 men from the reserve. Even though the Afghans were beaten they still offered resistance in repeated clashes in the following days as they withdrew.  Aftermath  The expedition did not in itself provide any strategic gains as such and Nader withdrew into upper Khorasan to re-consolidate and plan an offensive against Herat.

Whiling his hours away at a pachinko parlor, he meets Takuji Ohshiro (Masaki Suda), a young man on parole who impulsively invites him to a shabby house on the outskirts of town. There, Tatsuo glimpses Takuji‚Äôs bedridden father and callous mother, and meets his world-weary older sister Chinatsu Ohshiro (Chizuru Ikewaki). While immediately drawn to each other, romance is an unaffordable luxury for the emotionally closed-off Tatsuo and the disillusioned Chinatsu, who sells herself to provide for her family and keep her brother out of jail. As Tatsuo and Chinatsu take tentative steps towards a relationship, the happy-go-lucky Takuji latches onto Tatsuo, binding their fates. Each step they take to build a better life sets off a chain of actions that have devastating consequences.

The expedition was launched mainly due to Tahmasp's own incompetence and ill- thought attempt at curbing the powers of his upstart general and military genius.  Prelude to Conflict  After the brief campaign in southern Khorasan that culminated in the battle of Sangan Nader was determined on a more ambitious plan of action which involved the taking of Herat in order to completely subdue the Abdali Afghans. He thus agreed with his Monarch Tahmasp II that they would invade southward were their paths would converge, leading to the final destination of Herat. Unfortunately for Nader (and for himself as events would later show) Tahmasp was increasingly distrustful, perhaps jealous of Nader and under the pressure of many in his entourage did not march southward but instead north where he proclaimed Nader a traitor and asked loyal subjects to join in the battle against him.  Nader's Response  Nader's reaction was immediate. He left his brother in Mashad and set of with the bulk of his men and pursued Tahmasp north where the Shah was joined by the Qarachoorloo Kurds. The Shah was besieged by Nader in the fort \\"Kohne Sangan\\" where Nader brought up his guns to subject it to a heavy bombardment. The Kurds who came to relieve the Shah were lured into a ditch were Nader had concocted an elaborate trap in which he forced the Kurds into an ignominious surrender. Tahmasp cognisant of his precarious position sent a minister to negotiate with Nader. Nader claimed to be in fear of his life and when he was assured there was no cause for fear as the Tahmasp had given his word that no harm should befall him he mocked these guarantees mentioning that the Shah had also given his word that no harm would befall Fathali Khan but it only took a day before he was decapitated. Despite this he relented, alas for Tahmasp this did not entail a true return to kingship in any other way than in name, from this point he would function as Nader's stooge.  Pacification of the North  After taming Tahmasp, Nader advanced on Astarabad, then further into Mazandaran bringing the southern coast of the Caspian sea under his control. All his efforts bore fruit as he had secured Khorasan from all quarters and now with a subservient monarch under his thumb he could advance down onto Herat with both security as well as Royal legitimacy.

A long tall narrow building on the west side is an 1840s-built public house, the Cross Keys, Covent Garden. Location The immediate vicinity of Endell Street Endell Street is crossed only by Shorts Gardens and Shelton Street. Betterton Street intersects between these on the eastern side. The northern end of the street is in the London Borough of Camden, the south in the City of Westminster. The street is an avenue with very tall, mature plane trees, widely spaced; it now equals the B401 (which had included Bow and Wellington Streets) and is one-way, southbound. History The land on which the southern part of Endell Street is built was originally owned by William Short, who leased it to Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, in 1623-24\\\\. Lennox House was built on the site which eventually passed to Sir John Brownlow who began to build from 1682. Belton Street was created, named after the Brownlow's country seat in Lincolnshire, Belton House. Henry Wheatley writes that the southern end of the street from Castle Street to Short's Gardens was originally known as Old Belton Street, the northern end from Short's Gardens to St Giles, was known as New Belton Street. In the seventeenth century, Queen Anne is supposed to have bathed in the waters from a medical spring there at a site known as Queen Anne's Bath. The modern Endell Street was created according to the reforming plans of architect James Pennethorne. Charles Lethbridge Kingsford states that the street was built in 1846 when Belton Street was widened and extended northwards to Broad Street (now in High Holborn). The street is believed to have been named after the Reverend James Endell Tyler, rector of St Giles in the Fields in the 1840s. The British Lying-In Hospital was relocated to a purpose-built building on Endell Street in 1849. Listed buildings Premises of Lavers and Barraud There are eight listed buildings of the street, including: =Lavers and Barraud stained-glass studio= The Lavers and Barraud Building at 22 Endell Street, together with the attached cast-iron railings, is a Grade II listed building.

Gotch then started holding the \\"Simon Gotch Prize Fight Challenge\\" daring anyone to last five minutes in an exhibition match with him, without being pinned or submitting, with the prize being a purported large, but really a small amount of money. The first challenge took place on May 3, 2018. This went on for a few months with him defeating mostly local talent, with legends like Gangrel mixed in. During Lawlor's storyline with Low Ki over the MLW World Heavyweight Championship, Gotch walked Lawlor into an ambush by Ki's faction Promociones Dorado. The feud reached its boiling point on a December episode of MLW Fusion where Gotch faced Lawlor in a \\"no ropes, no disqualification\\" match, which was won by Lawlor. Contra Unit (2019-present) Following his betrayal of Lawlor, he was defeated by Ace Romero in his first loss during a Simon Gotch Prize Fight Challenge on January 2, 2019.

The president of the ASA, Alfred McClung Lee, having run into resistance against his efforts to reform the ASA, organized the formation of the AHS to be distinct and outside of the structure of the ASA. The first issue of The Humanist Sociologist newsletter was published later that year, and the first issue of the Humanity & Society journal was published in 1977, the only issue published that year. Beginning in 1978, the journal was published quarterly. With the journal's focus outside of mainstream sociology, article themes have included \\"human liberation\\", \\"unity and coalition building\\", \\"analysis of oppression and inequality\\", \\"studies of specific minority and disadvantaged minority groups\\" and \\"social change\\".Public Sociology: The Contemporary Debate; edited by Lawrence T. Nichols; Transaction Publishers 2011; Pgs. 41-72 The journal would also inform potential contributors that, \\"authors of articles will be asked to include information as to the primary moral and/or value commitments, as well as their commitments to any particular sociological paradigm ... [and] 'domain assumptions' that undergird their analyses.\\" The first editor of the journal was sociologist Charles P. Flynn. Although Al and Betty Lee never exercised control or edited the journal, it reflected their concern for issues of injustice, human suffering and social activism. The quarterly The Humanist Sociologist newsletter was initially developed and edited by Richard H.Wells.Sociology for People: Toward a Caring Profession; Alfred McClung Lee; Syracuse University Press, 1990; Pgs. 202 A review of the first two years of Humanity & Society published in the Contemporary Sociology journal described how it seeks \\"to redraw the domain of sociological discourse, theoretically, philosophically, substantively, or ethically. They challenge the status quo and the dominant tendency of current publications. Thus they are more difficult to evaluate by conventional standards.\\" According to this review, the journal and a couple journals like it show that the field of humanistic and interactionist sociology are active fields of inquiry, after neglect on the part of the major journals in sociology. The journal was described as having opened up previously restricted channels for qualitative sociologists to publish their empirical work.Review: Thoughts On Five New Journals And Some Old Ones; Malcolm Spector, Robert R.

Yu Xi had previously joined To‚Äôs on his films Blind Detective and Drug War as a screenwriter. Release Don't Go Breaking My Heart 2 was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2014. The film was released on 11 November 2014 in China, which is Singles Day. The film earned RMB42.1 million (US$6.88 million) from approximately 1.32 million admissions on 11 November making it the best opening gross for a film directed by Johnnie To in Mainland China. Reception The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, stating that the \\"Chinese dreams of love, wealth and sex make this rom-com reboot look very much like a calculated piggy-bank stuffer.\\" Slant Magazine gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"the worst film To has made since founding his independent studio Milkyway.\\" Slant opined that \\"this sequel jumbles the stakes and loses its drive, not least because, while Shen-ren still pines for Zixin, Qihong toils away on the mainland completely divorced from the story.\\" Variety gave the film a mixed review, comparing the film to the first, stating that \\"much like the first time, the results are as cheerfully silly as they are compulsively watchable, despite the somewhat disappointing decision to keep one of the series‚Äô most appealing stars (Daniel Wu) sidelined on the mainland for much of the running time.\\" and that director Johnnie To \\" undisputed master of the modern Hong Kong gangster drama, turns his attention to lighter fare (like this, or 2012‚Äôs sudser \\"Romancing in Thin Air\\"), it‚Äôs like watching a great baseball pitcher warming up in the bullpen: perfect form and follow-through minus any real sizzle.\\" References External links * Category:2014 films Category:2014 romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Chinese films Category:Chinese romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong romantic comedy films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films directed by Johnnie To Category:Media Asia films Category:Milkyway Image films Category:Hong Kong sequel films Category:Chinese sequel films Category:Films with screenplays by Wai Ka-fai Category:2014 comedy films ","title":"Don't Go Breaking My Heart 2"},{"id":"43742105","text":"Angelika Aleksandrovna Yutt (; born 5 November 1969 in Simferopol, Crimea, USSR), better known by stage name ANGELIKA (), ANGELIKA YUTT ( –Æ–¢–¢), is a Russian opera, pop, house and trance singer, vocal trainer, producer and music composer.

Life Born in Somerset, Martin was engaged in trade at Exeter. He was a member of the Bath Philosophical Society, and in 1794 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Later he obtained the post of secretary to a commission for adjusting St. Domingo claims, and settled in a house adjoining Poets' Corner, Westminster. To Martin's efforts, with others, was due the institution, in January 1805, of the Bath Society for the Investigation and Relief of Occasional Distress. He died at Blackheath, aged 90, on 20 November 1838. His wife died 9 August 1827, aged 73. Works Martin published The Aurelian's Vade-mecum; containing an English Catalogue of Plant' affording nourishment to Butterflies, Hawkmoths, and Moths in the state of Caterpillar, Exeter, 1785, and Observations on Marine Vermes, Insects, &c.;, fasc. 1, Exeter, 1786. About 1796 Martin began \\"an enquiry into the circumstances of beggars in the metropolis\\", and joined the Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor, of which he acted for a time as secretary. His Mendicity Enquiry Office, set up that year, interviewed 2,000 adults (over 90% female) and 3,000 children in seven months. He proposed a plan for a systematic inquiry into the nature and extent of begging in London, and in 1800 obtained a grant of ¬£1,000 from the treasury in two instalments. His report, in the form of a Letter to Lord Pelham on the State of Mendicity in the Metropolis, was published in 1803, and reissued by the society in 1811. Martin estimated that London had 15,000 beggars, if children were included. He saw the workhouse as contributing to professional begging. In 1812 Martin apparently undertook a further inquiry, supported in part by a government grant and in part by subscriptions. He issued An Appeal to Public benevolence for the Relief of Beggars, 1812. A parliamentary committee in 1815 heard a report based on 4,500 cases.

Knowing the amino acid sequence of peptides from a protein digest is essential for studying the biological function of the protein. In the old days, this was accomplished by the Edman degradation procedure. Today, analysis by a tandem mass spectrometer is a more common method to solve the sequencing of peptides. Generally, there are two approaches: database search and de novo sequencing. Database search is a simple version as the mass spectra data of the unknown peptide is submitted and run to find a match with a known peptide sequence, the peptide with the highest matching score will be selected. This approach fails to recognize novel peptides since it can only match to existing sequences in the database. De novo sequencing is an assignment of fragment ions from a mass spectrum. Different algorithms are used for interpretation and most instruments come with de novo sequencing programs. Peptide fragmentation Peptides are protonated in positive-ion mode. The proton initially locates at the N-terminus or a basic residue side chain, but because of the internal solvation, it can move along the backbone breaking at different sites which result in different fragments. The fragmentation rules are well explained by some publications. Three different types of backbone bonds can be broken to form peptide fragments: alkyl carbonyl (CHR-CO), peptide amide bond (CO-NH), and amino alkyl bond (NH-CHR). =Different types of fragment ions= 6 types of sequence ions in peptide fragmentation When the backbone bonds cleave, six different types of sequence ions are formed as shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminal charged fragment ions are classed as a, b or c, while the C-terminal charged ones are classed as x, y or z. The subscript n is the number of amino acid residues. The nomenclature was first proposed by Roepstorff and Fohlman, then Biemann modified it and this became the most widely accepted version. Among these sequence ions, a, b and y-ions are the most common ion types, especially in the low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometers, since the peptide amide bond (CO-NH) is the most vulnerable and the loss of CO from b-ions. Mass of b-ions = ‚àë (residue masses) + 1 (H+) Mass of y-ions = ‚àë (residue masses) + 19 (H2O+H+) Mass of a-ions = mass of b-ions ‚Äì 28 (CO) Double backbone cleavage produces internal ions, acylium-type like H2N-CHR2-CO-NH-CHR3-CO+ or immonium-type like H2N-CHR2-CO-NH+=CHR3. These ions are usually disturbance in the spectra. Satellite ions in peptide fragmentation Further cleavage happens under high- energy CID at the side chain of C-terminal residues, forming dn, vn, wn-ions. =Fragmentation rules summary= Most fragment ions are b- or y-ions. a-ions are also frequently seen by the loss of CO from b-ions. Satellite ions(wn, vn, dn-ions) are formed by high-energy CID. Ser-, Thr-, Asp- and Glu-containing ions generate neutral molecular loss of water (-18). Asn-, Gln-, Lys-, Arg- containing ions generate neutral molecular loss of ammonia (-17). Neutral loss of ammonia from Arg leads to fragment ions (y-17) or (b-17) ions with higher abundance than their corresponding ions. When C-terminus has a basic residue, the peptide generates (bn-1+18) ion. A complementary b-y ion pair can be observed in multiply charged ions spectra. For this b-y ion pair, the sum of their subscripts is equal to the total number of amino acid residues in the unknown peptide. If the C-terminus is Arg or Lys, y1-ion can be found in the spectrum to prove it. =Methods for peptide fragmentation= In low energy collision induced dissociation (CID), b- and y-ions are the main product ions. In addition, loss of ammonia (-17 Da) is observed in fragment with RKNQ amino acids in it. Loss of water (-18 Da) can be observed in fragment with STED amino acids in it. No satellite ions are shown in the spectra. In high energy CID, all different types of fragment ions can be observed but no losses of ammonia or water. In electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and electron capture dissociation (ECD), the predominant ions are c, y, z+1, z+2 and sometimes w ions. For post source decay (PSD) in MALDI, a, b, y-ions are most common product ions. Factors affecting fragmentation are the charge state (the higher charge state, the less energy is needed for fragmentation), mass of the peptide (the larger mass, the more energy is required), induced energy (higher energy leads to more fragmentation), primary amino acid sequence, mode of dissociation and collision gas. Guidelines for interpretation Table 1. Mass of amino acid fragment ions For interpretation, first, look for single amino acid immonium ions (H2N+=CHR2). Corresponding immonium ions for amino acids are listed in Table 1. Ignore a few peaks at the high-mass end of the spectrum. They are ions that undergo neutral molecules losses (H2O, NH3, CO2, HCOOH) from [M+H]+ ions. Find mass differences at 28 Da since b-ions can form a-ions by loss of CO. Look for b2-ions at low-mass end of the spectrum, which helps to identify yn-2-ions too. Mass of b2-ions are listed in Table 2, as well as single amino acids that have equal mass to b2-ions. The mass of b2-ion = mass of two amino acid residues + 1. Table 2. Mass of b2-ions in peptide fragmentation Identify a sequence ion series by the same mass difference, which matches one of the amino acid residue masses (see Table 1). For example, mass differences between an and an-1, bn and bn-1, cn and cn-1 are the same. Identify yn-1-ion at the high-mass end of the spectrum. Then continue to identify yn-2, yn-3... ions by matching mass differences with the amino acid residue masses (see Table 1). Look for the corresponding b-ions of the identified y-ions. The mass of b+y ions is the mass of the peptide +2 Da. After identifying the y-ion series and b-ion series, assign the amino acid sequence and check the mass. The other method is to identify b-ions first and then find the corresponding y-ions. Algorithms and software Manual de novo sequencing is labor-intensive and time consuming. Usually algorithms or programs come with the mass spectrometer instrument are applied for the interpretation of spectra. =Development of de novo sequencing algorithms= An old method is to list all possible peptides for the precursor ion in mass spectrum, and match the mass spectrum for each candidate to the experimental spectrum. The possible peptide that has the most similar spectrum will have the highest chance to be the right sequence. However, the number of possible peptides may be large. For example, a precursor peptide with a molecular weight of 774 has 21,909,046 possible peptides. Even though it is done in the computer, it takes a long time. Another method is called \\"subsequencing\\", which instead of listing whole sequence of possible peptides, matches short sequences of peptides that represent only a part of the complete peptide. When sequences that highly match the fragment ions in the experimental spectrum are found, they are extended by residues one by one to find the best matching. In the third method, graphical display of the data is applied, in which fragment ions that have the same mass differences of one amino acid residue are connected by lines. In this way, it is easier to get a clear image of ion series of the same type. This method could be helpful for manual de novo peptide sequencing, but doesn't work for high-throughput condition. The fourth method, which is considered to be successful, is the graph theory. Applying graph theory in de novo peptide sequencing was first mentioned by Bartels. Peaks in the spectrum are transformed into vertices in a graph called \\"spectrum graph\\". If two vertices have the same mass difference of one or several amino acids, a directed edge will be applied. The SeqMS algorithm, Lutefisk algorithm, Sherenga algorithm are some examples of this type. =Software packages= As described by Andreotti et al. in 2012, Antilope is a combination of Lagrangian relaxation and an adaptation of Yen's k shortest paths. It is based on 'spectrum graph' method and contains different scoring functions, and can be comparable on the running time and accuracy to \\"the popular state-of-the-art programs\\" PepNovo and NovoHMM. Grossmann et al. presented AUDENS in 2005 as an automated de novo peptide sequencing tool containing a preprocessing module that can recognize signal peaks and noise peaks. Lutefisk can solve de novo sequencing from CID mass spectra. In this algorithm, significant ions are first found, then determine the N- and C-terminal evidence list. Based on the sequence list, it generates complete sequences in spectra and scores them with the experimental spectrum. However, the result may include several sequence candidates that have only little difference, so it is hard to find the right peptide sequence. A second program, CIDentify, which is a modified version by Alex Taylor of Bill Pearson's FASTA algorithm, can be applied to distinguish those uncertain similar candidates. Mo et al. presented the MSNovo algorithm in 2007 and proved that it performed \\"better than existing de novo tools on multiple data sets\\". This algorithm can do de novo sequencing interpretation of LCQ, LTQ mass spectrometers and of singly, doubly, triply charged ions. Different from other algorithms, it applied a novel scoring function and use a mass array instead of a spectrum graph. Fisher et al. proposed the NovoHMM method of de novo sequencing. A hidden Markov model(HMM) is applied as a new way to solve de novo sequencing in a Bayesian framework. Instead of scoring for single symbols of the sequence, this method considers posterior probabilities for amino acids. In the paper, this method is proved to have better performance than other popular de novo peptide sequencing methods like PepNovo by a lot of example spectra. PEAKS is a complete software package for the interpretation of peptide mass spectra. It contains de novo sequencing, database search, PTM identification, homology search and quantification in data analysis. Ma et al. described a new model and algorithm for de novo sequencing in PEAKS, and compared the performance with Lutefisk of several tryptic peptides of standard proteins, by the quadrupole time-of-flight(Q-TOF) mass spectrometer. PepNovo is a high throughput de novo peptide sequencing tool and uses a probabilistic network as scoring method. It usually takes less than 0.2 seconds for interpretation of one spectrum. Described by Frank et al., PepNovo works better than several popular algorithms like Sherenga, PEAKS, Lutefisk. Now a new version PepNovo+ is available. Chi et al. presented pNovo+ in 2013 as a new de novo peptide sequencing tool by using complementary HCD and ETD tandem mass spectra. In this method, a component algorithm, pDAG, largely speeds up the acquisition time of peptide sequencing to 0.018s on average, which is three times as fast as the other popular de novo sequencing software. As described by Jeong et al., compared with other do novo peptide sequencing tools, which works well on only certain types of spectra, UniNovo is a more universal tool that has a good performance on various types of spectra or spectral pairs like CID, ETD, HCD, CID/ETD, etc. It has a better accuracy than PepNovo+ or PEAKS. Moreover, it generates the error rate of the reported peptide sequences. Ma published Novor in 2015 as a real-time de novo peptide sequencing engine. The tool is sought to improve the de novo speed by an order of magnitude and retain similar accuracy as other de novo tools in the market. On a Macbook Pro laptop, Novor has achieved more than 300 MS/MS spectra per second. Pevtsov et al. compared the performance of the above five de novo sequencing algorithms: AUDENS, Lutefisk, NovoHMM, PepNovo, and PEAKS . QSTAR and LCQ mass spectrometer data were employed in the analysis, and evaluated by relative sequence distance (RSD) value, which was the similarity between de novo peptide sequencing and true peptide sequence calculated by a dynamic programming method. Results showed that all algorithms had better performance in QSTAR data than on LCQ data, while PEAKS as the best had a success rate of 49.7% in QSTAR data, and NovoHMM as the best had a success rate of 18.3% in LCQ data. The performance order in QSTAR data was PEAKS > Lutefisk, PepNovo > AUDENS, NovoHMM, and in LCQ data was NovoHMM > PepNovo, PEAKS > Lutefisk > AUDENS. Compared in a range of spectrum quality, PEAKS and NovoHMM also showed the best performance in both data among all 5 algorithms. PEAKS and NovoHMM had the best sensitivity in both QSTAR and LCQ data as well. However, no evaluated algorithms exceeded a 50% of exact identification for both data sets.

She is based on Piper Kerman, author of the non-fiction book Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison, upon which the series is based. Schilling was nominated for awards in both comedy and drama categories for this role. Basis A Boston-bred Smith College grad, Piper Kerman got involved in a relationship with an international drug smuggler, Catherine Cleary Wolters. Chapman's girlfriend in the series, Alex Vause, is based on Wolters, whom Kerman met circa 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts. Eventually, 24-year-old Kerman flew a suitcase of money from the United States to Belgium for a West African drug lord and was named five years later as part of the drug ring. As part of her plea bargain, she declared that she made three overseas trips on behalf of the drug ring. After breaking up with Wolters, Kerman met Larry Bloom and got engaged before being charged by the feds in 1998 and striking a deal. She spent 13 months in a Danbury, Connecticut women's prison, FCI Danbury. Kerman actually had a six-year delay between being sentenced to prison and entering prison in 2004. The show is based on Kerman's 2010 book Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison about her year in a minimum security federal women's prison. Chapman's fianc√©, Larry Bloom, is based on Smith, Kerman's real life boyfriend and eventual husband. Series creator Jenji Kohan had initially considered casting Katie Holmes in the role, but decided against it as Holmes had too many commitments. Ultimately Kohan cast Taylor Schilling. Characterization Taylor Schilling plays Piper Chapman Chapman is a 31-year-old White Anglo-Saxon Protestant who is sentenced to 15 months in prison for carrying a bag of drug-money ($50,000) to Belgium for her girlfriend, Alex Vause. Prior to prison, Chapman owned an artisanal bath soap business in Brooklyn. She comes from a wealthy family, and was a debutante as a teenager. She is originally from Connecticut. Chapman is bisexual, and in college was in a relationship with Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), a drug smuggler. 10 years prior to the series' beginning, she carried drug money from Colombia to Belgium with Vause. Eventually, Chapman grew disenchanted with Vause's lifestyle and broke up with her. She then began dating Larry Bloom (Jason Biggs), to whom she got engaged. Piper is one of very few emphatically atheist inmates on the show. She responds to a request that she baptise herself by saying that she cannot pretend to believe in a god, saying that while it might make her happier if she believed in a religion, she \\"needs it to be true\\", and instead looks to science to explain the world. In another episode, when confronted on the subject again, she clarifies that \\"I've always thought agnostic was a sort of cop-out... If I had to label it I'd say that I'm a secular humanist.\\" In 2018, Schilling stated that while Walter White of Breaking Bad was written with having a rationale for each action, \\"Piper's behavior oftentimes feels groundless\\" and \\"the audience can't quite grab onto Piper's behavior. It seems like it's coming out of nowhere.\\" Storylines =Season 1= Chapman is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Prison, for criminal conspiracy and money laundering; Vause had been arrested and named Chapman as an accomplice in order to reduce her own sentence. On Chapman's first day, Chapman gets felt up by guard George \\"Pornstache\\" Mendez (Pablo Schreiber) and unintentionally offends prison matriarch Red (Kate Mulgrew), who runs the prison cafeteria. Red starves Chapman to make an example of her, and the other inmates are too intimidated to help except for Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba). Nonetheless, Chapman resists Crazy Eyes' subsequent advances and makes amends with Red by making her lotion to help her painful back. Chapman befriends Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne), who becomes her confidante and protector. Chapman also discovers Vause has also been sentenced to Litchfield. Chapman is assigned to the prison's electrical workshop and accidentally pockets a screwdriver. Her cellmate, Miss Claudette (Michelle Hurst), helps her evade the guards' searches. In order to ingratiate herself with the other inmates, Chapman offers to review their appeal letters. Although Bloom learns that Vause was the informant who gave Chapman up, he does not share this information with his fianc√©e. Chapman then rekindles her relationship with Vause. Meanwhile, Bloom, an aspiring writer, publishes a story about Chapman's incarceration that paints unflattering portraits of her fellow inmates and the prison staff. The article earns Chapman the ire of both the guards and the other prisoners, and severely strains on her already fading relationship with Bloom. Chapman is elected to the prison council but finds that the only change she is able to make is to get the track reopened for Janae Watson (Vicky Jeudy), who was put in solitary confinement during the screwdriver incident. Chapman makes an enemy of Tiffany \\"Pennsatucky\\" Doggett (Taryn Manning), who wanted her spot on the council. Doggett tells the inmate counselor Sam Healy (Michael J. Harney) about Chapman and Vause's relationship; Healy punishes Chapman by putting her in solitary confinement and telling Bloom about the affair. Bloom gets back at Chapman by doing an interview on NPR that casts Litchfield in a harsh light, which makes her even more unpopular. During an angry phone call, Bloom reveals that Vause informed on her. Vause asks Chapman to choose between her and Bloom. Chapman chooses Bloom, but Vause breaks them up and spurns Chapman. When Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv, Chapman finally snaps and beats her to a pulp. =Season 2= After spending a month in solitary confinement, Chapman is flown to Chicago to serve as a witness against the drug kingpin who had been Vause's boss. There, she spends time in a maximum security prison with dangerous inmates who menace her daily. Also in episode 1, \\"Thirsty Bird\\", we see Chapman as a young girl (Clare Foley) in a flashback, discovering that her father is cheating on her mother. Vause persuades Chapman to commit perjury in order to keep them safe from the drug lord, but ultimately cuts a deal to testify against her former boss in return for early release; she then leaves Chapman to suffer the consequences of her perjured testimony alone. In episode 3, \\"Hugs Can Be Deceiving\\", we find out that Crazy Eyes had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after she had beaten up Doggett at the end of season 1. In episode 6, \\"You Also Have a Pizza\\", Chapman starts a prison newsletter, and makes a deal with a reporter to investigate the financial goings on at the prison. She eventually uncovers evidence that assistant warden Natalie Figueroa (Alysia Reiner) has been embezzling from the prison. To keep her quiet, Figueroa arranges for Chapman to be transferred to a facility in Virginia. However, when Chapman gives prison administrator Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow) the evidence implicating Figueroa, he cancels the transfer and gives the warden the incriminating information, resulting in Figueroa's resignation. Chapman gets a furlough to go to her grandmother's funeral. At home in New York City, she realizes that Larry has lost interest in her, and soon learns that he has fallen in love with her best friend, Polly Harper (Maria Dizzia). Chapman is furious at first, but eventually agrees to give them her blessing in return for either of them telling Vause's parole officer that Vause is going to break parole, which will land her back in Litchfield. =Season 3= Chapman begins a business selling used panties to people outside of Litchfield, enlisting her brother Cal as her middleman. Chapman begins a romantic relationship with an Australian prisoner, Stella (Ruby Rose Langenheim). After Stella steals Chapman's money, she plants contraband in Stella's bunk and orchestrates her being sent to the maximum security unit in retaliation the day before Stella's release date. =Season 4= Chapman continues her panty business but finds herself in competition with a group of Dominicans led by Maria Ruiz. When Chapman aligns herself with a gang of white supremacists and plants contraband in Maria's bunk, Maria retaliates by kidnapping her and having her branded with a swastika.VanArendonk, Kathryn. \\"Orange Is the New Black Recap: Piper the Nazi.\\" Vulture. June 17, 2016. Retrieved on July 2, 2016. =Season 7= Now out of prison Piper struggles to adjust to her new lifestyle on the outside. Critical commentary According to Emily VanDerWerff of Vox Media's Vox.com Chapman was a character with \\"tricky contradictions and likability issues\\". In reviewing season 1, Matthew Wolfson Slant Magazine describes Chapman as \\"a familiar vessel through which to comprehend prison's unfamiliar terrain\\". Over the course of the first season, the show becomes less focused on Chapman, according to James Poniewozik of Time. The Boston Globe describes Chapman's assimilation into prison as a display of \\"Martha Stewart-like efforts to survive\\". At the time of the Golden Globe Award nomination, Entertainment Weekly described Chapman in prison as a woman who was \\"totally out of her element\\" and said that the role was dichotomous with demands to \\"vacillate between being sympathy-worthy and trying fans‚Äô patience with Chapman's entitlement\\". Tom Meltzer of The Guardian wrote \\"Chapman's romantic and rebellious re-awakening drives the show, but it is the ensemble that kept us coming back for more\\". By season 2, Piper remained a main character of an ensemble cast but not the central character according to IGN's Matt Fowler. Liz Raftery of TV Guide says \\"There's a lot going on in Season 2 of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, and very little of it has to do with Piper Chapman\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone considered that the show's ensemble focus has turned Piper into \\"dead weight\\" and \\"nobody would argue that an early parole for her would hurt the show\\". As he reviewed season 2, The Huffington Post Canada entertainment editor Chris Jancelewicz, opined that \\"Schilling's deadpan expressions and snap comedic timing help us empathize and grow to love her\\" as her character became more understandable. Alicia Lutes of MTV wrote that as of Season 2 the show is about Piper understanding herself and her capabilities better \\"even if those abilities put her further in the muck\\" and not about her possible reformation.Lutes, Alicia. \\"We‚Äôre So Mad at Piper After That ‚ÄòOrange is The New Black‚Äô Premiere.\\" MTV.

Warren is portrayed as intelligent, but lacking in social skills, and prone to spiral into emotional outbursts when agitated, as well as hallucinations and delusions, due to mental illness. The character is the only role that has received Emmy Award recognition in both the comedy and drama genres from the same show and the second character to earn Emmy recognition in both genres. Aduba won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series as well as the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for her season one performance. She received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her season two performance. Her season three performance again won Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. She is a recurring character in season one and a regular character beginning with season two. Appearance In season one, Aduba is credited for 11 of the 13 episodes (not the first or seventh), although she appears in the first episode via footage filmed from another episode. In season two, episode three (\\"Hugs Can Be Deceiving\\"), Eden Wiggins, and Taliyah Whitaker portray the 10-year-old and 5-year-old versions of Warren. Throughout the first two seasons, it is shown that Warren aspires \\"to be included\\" and \\"to make friends and be valued\\". The character is known for her bantu knots, an awkward grin, and her crazy eyes. Storylines =Season 1= Suzanne is fixated on Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) at the beginning of the season. When Chapman, who has offended prison matriarch Red (Kate Mulgrew), seems hopelessly isolated, Suzanne is the only inmate not too intimidated to help her. She helps Chapman by getting jalape√±os, so she can put them in a medicinal lotion for Red's sore back, and Red forgives Chapman. Suzanne nicknames Chapman \\"Dandelion\\", because of her blonde hair and puts in a request to become Chapman's bunkmate. Nonetheless, Chapman resists her advances. As a result, Suzanne urinates on the floor in Chapman's bunk quarters. In episode 9, \\"Fucksgiving\\", her adoptive parents, Pat and Dennis Warren, are introduced. =Season 2= As she rebounds from her unrequited love for Chapman, Suzanne is befriended by veteran inmate Yvonne \\"Vee\\" Parker (Lorraine Toussaint) as Vee develops her powerbase in the prison. Vee takes advantage of Suzanne's desperation for affection, and Suzanne becomes Vee's fanatically loyal right-hand woman. Suzanne serves Vee as muscle, even beating up her friend Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) on Vee's orders. When Vee attacks prison matriarch Galina \\"Red\\" Reznikov (Kate Mulgrew) and puts her in the hospital ward, she manipulates Suzanne into believing that she committed the crime. Suzanne gives a statement to prison officials confessing to the attack, but inmate counselor Sam Healy (Michael J. Harney) produces evidence that exonerates her. When she realizes that Vee used her, she breaks into tears. In episode 3, \\"Hugs Can Be Deceiving\\", Suzanne's backstory is revealed via a flashback. She was adopted by white parents and raised in the suburbs, but her mental instability alienated her classmates and their parents alike. Her adoptive mother pushed her to excel at everything she did to prove that she was as good as everyone else; ironically, the constant pressure only made Suzanne's psychological problems worse. In the same episode, it is revealed that Suzanne had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after Chapman had beaten Tiffany \\"Pennsatucky\\" Doggett (Taryn Manning) unconscious at the end of season 1. =Season 3= In season 3, Taystee has her hands full trying to control Suzanne, who is still grieving Vee's death and is unstable, prone to losing her temper and constantly fighting with Poussey. Eventually, she turns to new prison counsellor Berdie Rogers's drama class. There, she begins writing a surrealistic science-fiction erotica series called \\"The Time Hump Chronicles\\" which, although considered obscene and strange by both Rogers and Taystee, becomes an instant hit amongst the inmates. Although they prove to be therapeutic for her mental health, Suzanne becomes stressed and irritated with the constant harassment by the other inmates for more material, the persistent ideas that are being floated past her and the fan-fiction that is left at her bunk or lying around. Soon, some of the extracts find their way into the hands of the COs, resulting in Officer Donaldson being mocked by both his colleagues and the inmates alike upon the realization that he is the inspiration for one of the characters. This leads to Rogers' suspension. Meanwhile, Suzanne is taken by surprise when she discovers that one of her more prolific fans, Maureen Kukudio, is actually interested in her romantically. Suzanne seeks advice from Lorna about how to respond; she admits she finds Maureen attractive, but she has never had a girlfriend before and subsequently feels she must back away from a sexual liaison. In the season finale, Suzanne assists Poussey and Taystee in caring for Brook Soso, whom they discover unconscious from a drug overdose, and develops a closer bond with Maureen in the final scene, owing to a misunderstanding over a turtle that bites Maureen's foot. =Season 4= In season 4 it is revealed that Suzanne's crime was kidnapping and involuntary manslaughter involving the death of a child she grew friendly with while working as a store greeter. Believing that she and the boy were simply being friends, she did not realize the implications of her actions when she came across him playing in the park and invited him to her apartment for ice cream and video games. The boy went willingly, but soon became frightened and wanted to call his father. While Suzanne is out of the room preparing for what she plans as more fun, he calls 911. Suzanne becomes agitated, and the boy panics and tries to get away. He goes onto the fire escape and falls to his death. It is mentioned that she took a plea deal. When the inmates take advantage of a temporary lack of security and enjoy the nearby lake and woods, Kukudio insists that she and Suzanne run away together. Suzanne refuses and their relationship becomes rocky. In \\"People Persons\\", CO Humphrey commands the two of them to fight. Suzanne rejects this but Maureen, who wants to fight, provokes her by launching into a stream of insults. Suzanne fully retaliates by throwing Maureen to the ground and beating her repeatedly, until the Dominicans pull her off. Suzanne feels guilty for hurting Maureen, and punishes herself. She demonstrates this especially when a peaceful protest in the jail cafeteria turns into a chaotic scene and Poussey Washington dies by suffocation. Whilst the inmates grieve over her death, Suzanne believes that Poussey is alive and tries numerous times to suffocate herself. Finally, she is sent to Medical and is placed in a bed next to Kukudio. =Season 5= In season five, Suzanne continues to recover from her injuries and also goes out of her way to help Maureen, whose injuries are severe. The chaos of the riot prevents the consistency she is used to and has a hard time adjusting. Other inmates try to mimic the consistency for her at times. She continues to believe that Poussey's spirit is trying to talk to her and performs a seance on the spot in the cafeteria where Poussey died. Lorna and Nicky take over the dispensation of meds; Lorna refuses to give Suzanne hers, pressuring her to believe she no longer needs them. As a result, Suzanne's grasp on reality soon spirals out of control, especially when she tears down fiberboard in the dorm ceiling, trying to find \\"heaven\\". Cindy intervenes but, not knowing the correct prescriptions, feeds Suzanne lithium instead. Suzanne becomes catatonic but is subsequently revived by an epipen. =Season 6= At the beginning of Season 6, during the aftermath of the riot, Suzanne is being interrogated about the riot but, due to not using her medication, has hallucinations and does not coherently answer the questions. She finally gets her medication and is released to general population after being in Administrative Segregation (Ad Seg). She is sent to B Block which is nicknamed \\"Florida\\" because it is for the elderly and mentally ill prisoners. When the prison restarts the kickball league that had been discontinued years before, she joins and quickly becomes a star player. Critical commentary According to Tom Meltzer of The Guardian, \\"Shakespeare-quoting loner 'Crazy Eyes' invites pity, shock, reproach and belly-laughs in equal measure.\\" The Huffington Post Canada entertainment editor Chris Jancelewicz, noted that after the first six episodes of season two, he was impressed by this appropriately nicknamed character: \\"Girl is crazy, and Aduba is genuinely frightening in the role. You can't tell if she's harmless or secretly plotting Piper's death\\". Aduba won Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards as well as Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series at the 4th Critics' Choice Television Awards and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 18th Satellite Awards for her season 1 performance. Aduba's season 2 performance earned her the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards and a nomination Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. At the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, due to recent rule changes, the show was forced to compete as a drama series rather than a comedy one and Aduba was nominated and won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Previously, Lou Grant played by Ed Asner was the only character for whom an actor had won both drama and comedy Emmy recognition (but in different shows). She also earned a nomination at the 46th NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series.

Based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the film follows an ambitious Ybor City bootlegger (Affleck) who becomes a notorious gangster. The film also stars Elle Fanning, Brendan Gleeson, Chris Messina, Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana and Chris Cooper. Produced by Warner Bros., the film premiered in New York City on December 13, 2016. It began a limited release in the United States on December 25, 2016, before going wide on January 13, 2017. It received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb, grossing $22 million against its net budget of $65 million. The film lost around $75 million, according to insiders and rival studio executives.  Plot  In 1926, Joe Coughlin, a World War I veteran of Irish descent and the prodigal son of Boston police captain Thomas Coughlin, falls in love with Emma Gould, the mistress of notorious gangster Albert White, the boss of the Irish Gang of Boston who Joe and his friends have been targeting in a series of robberies. Thomas objects to the relationship and advises Joe against his criminal activities, warning him that his wrongdoing will catch up with him eventually. White's rival, Italian Mafia boss Maso Pescatore, finds out about their affair and blackmails Joe to kill White. Joe refuses, and instead he and Emma decide to flee to California. To fund the trip, Joe commits a bank heist with his partner Dion Bartolo and another man, during which three police officers are killed in an ensuing chase. When Joe goes to meet Emma, he discovers that she betrayed him to White. Joe is brutally beaten by White's men and nearly killed before Thomas and the police arrive and arrest Joe for the policemen's murders. Thomas tells Joe that Emma drowned while being pursued by police. He also blackmails Chief Inspector Calvin Bondurant to ensure that Joe is indicted on a relatively minor charge rather than murder, and he is given only a three-year sentence. Two weeks before Joe's release, Thomas dies of a heart attack. Wanting revenge against White, Joe volunteers his services to Pescatore and is recruited as an enforcer for the latter's rum empire in Ybor City in Tampa, Florida, which is under attack by White. Joe brings Dion along and together they protect Pescatore's business in the area; the boss then sends orders for them to bring gambling and drugs into Tampa. Joe also develops a relationship with Graciela Corrales, the sister of a local Cuban businessman who supplies most of the rum, and they are soon married. Joe befriends Sheriff Irving Figgis to get police protection for his bootlegging. Irving's daughter Loretta heads to Hollywood to become an actress but instead becomes a heroin-addicted prostitute. Irving's brother-in-law, R. D. Pruitt, a member of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan who blames Joe for bringing more non-white immigrants into Tampa, starts bombing Joe's businesses and killing his men. Joe promises Irving to help get Loretta off drugs and back to Ybor City in exchange for betraying Pruitt. Joe kills Pruitt personally and has his men hunt down and kill all of Tampa's KKK members in a string of brutal assassinations. With Prohibition coming to an end, Pescatore orders Joe to switch to selling narcotics, which he disagrees with, instead planning to build a mob casino near Sarasota. He intends to persuade the state government to legalize gambling, but Loretta, who has become a devout Christian under her father's strict and punishing discipline, begins preaching that alcohol and gambling are against God's word. Her ministry is popular enough that the government decides not to legalize gambling. Joe recognizes that Pescatore will be enraged, particularly since Joe still refuses to invest in narcotics. During a private meeting in a restaurant to settle their differences, Loretta confides to Joe that she does not truly believe in God and her sins cannot be forgiven. The next day, Joe is despondent to learn that Loretta committed suicide. While visiting his brother-in-law, an amateur photographer, Joe finds a recent picture of Emma, whom he believed to be dead. He decides to pursue her, but only after informing Graciela first, much to Dion's dismay. Pescatore orders Joe to meet with him at a local hotel, where he reveals he has reconciled with White and given him the honor of killing Joe for his failures, planning to replace him with his son Digger. Anticipating Pescatore's betrayal, Joe distracts White by showing him Emma's picture, as White also believed her to be dead. Dion and his men ambush Pescatore's gang through a series of tunnels Joe had previously used to move rum into the hotel. In the ensuing gunfight, White, Pescatore and Digger are all killed, eliminating all of Joe's enemies in one stroke. He names Dion as his successor before locating Emma at the brothel she now works at. She relates how she faked her death to escape from White and enjoys her newfound freedom, and claims she never reciprocated Joe's love for her. Satisfied, Joe returns to Graciela. Joe and Graciela move to Miami, where they have a son, Tommy, and devote their time to building houses for the impoverished. Driven insane by Loretta's death, Figgis tracks them down and shoots up their house, killing Graciela before being fatally shot by Joe. Joe arranges for Graciela to be buried in her homeland in Cuba and spends the rest of his days dedicated to charity and to raising Tommy, who soon voices his desire to become a police officer.

In October 2012, it was announced that Ben Affleck would direct, write, and star in the film; he and Jennifer Todd would produce through their production company Pearl Street Films, along with Appian Way's DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson Killoran. =Pre-production= In the summer of 2013, Affleck and film crew members visited Tampa, Florida, and Lawrence, Massachusetts, to scout for locations. In August 2013, it was reported that production would be pushed back from the fall of 2013 to the fall of 2014, due to Affleck's acting commitments in Gone Girl (2014) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). He visited various locations in Brunswick, Georgia in the summer of 2014. Affleck stated in a September 2014 interview that the film had been green-lit: \\"It's supposed to start shooting in July [2015] and I'll start prepping in March. We got a budget, we got locations.\\" On September 4, 2014, Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana and Elle Fanning joined the cast of the film. Affleck visited Brunswick, Georgia, again in February 2015. On July 9, 2015, Warner Bros.' decision to green-light the film was officially announced. Miller, Saldana and Fanning were all still attached to the project. From August to December 2015, other cast members were gradually revealed, including Chris Messina, Chris Cooper, Miguel, Max Casella, Scott Eastwood (who did not appear in the finished film), Brendan Gleeson, Anthony Michael Hall, and Titus Welliver. =Filming= Principal photography began on October 28, 2015, in coastal Georgia. Exterior scenes were filmed in Brunswick, at Affleck's private property on Hampton Island near Riceboro, on Tybee Island, in Savannah, and at Fort Pulaski National Monument. Tampa's film commissioner said tax rebates in both Georgia and Affleck's home on Hampton Island, a 45-minute drive from Brunswick, had led the filmmakers to choose the state instead of Florida. Filming took place in Lawrence, North Andover, and Boston's North End. From December 2015 to February 2016, filming took place in Los Angeles, California. Scenes were shot at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Pasadena, and in Wilmington. Cinematographer Robert Richardson used both the Arri Alexa 65 and vintage 65 lenses from Panavision. =Post-production= William Goldenberg signed on as the film's editor; he had previously worked with Affleck on Gone Baby Gone and Argo. Harry Gregson-Williams, who previously worked with Affleck on Gone Baby Gone and The Town, composed the score. In March 2016, Affleck remarked: \\"Editing is a strange process. It's a lot of ups and downs, but overall, the movie has amazing performances. I just got so lucky with the cast. They're incredible ... The hardest part about the process now is trying to find stuff to cut out because I don't want the movie to be too long.\\"  Release  In November 2013, Warner Bros. scheduled the film for a Christmas 2015 release date. In May 2014, the release date was moved to October 7, 2016 and, in August 2015, it was pushed to an unknown release date in 2017. In March 2016, Warner Bros. stated that the film would be released on October 20, 2017. In June 2016, however, the release date was changed to January 13, 2017. In October 2016, the film was pushed up to a limited release on December 25, 2016, before opening wide on January 13. Reception =Box office= Live by Night grossed $10.4 million in the United States and Canada and $12.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $22.7 million, against a net production budget of $65 million. Over its first two days of release, the film grossed $49,000 (including $33,000 on its opening day) for a four-theater average of $8,250, finishing 34th at the box office. In North America, the film had its expansion alongside new openers Monster Trucks, The Bye Bye Man and Sleepless, as well as the wide releases of Silence and Patriots Day. It was expected to gross around $10 million from 2,822 theaters in its four-day MLK opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $5.1 million (a four-day total of $6.2 million), finishing 11th at the box office. Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's poor opening to its crowded release weekend, as well as lack of critical praise and award buzz. 54% of its opening weekend attendance was male, while 88% was over the age of 25. The film grossed $1.8 million in its second weekend of wide release (a drop of 64.8%), falling to 15th at the box office. In its third week of wide release the film was pulled from 94.1% of theaters (2,822 to 163) and grossed just $101,028, marking at the time the largest third-week theater drop in history (besting the 2,523 theater decrease set by Meet Dave in 2008); the record was overtaken by The Darkest Minds in August 2018. Due to its poor performance, the film is expected to lose Warner Bros. around $75 million. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 35% based on 234 reviews, and an average rating of 5.19/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Live by Night boasts visual style and an impressive cast, but they're lost in a would-be crime saga that finds producer, director, and star Ben Affleck revisiting familiar themes to diminishing effect.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a mixed review, and noted that it felt rushed to completion, saying, \\"I am a fan of the movies Ben Affleck has directed. That's why Live by Night is such a disappointment. I was actively looking forward to it. And I would have given it any benefit of the doubt, but this movie just isn't there. It feels like a rushed project that Affleck had to get out of the way before he plays Batman again.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety also gave the film a mixed review, writing: \\"It's like seeing the ghost of a terrific movie: All the pieces are in place, yet as you're watching it (or thinking back on it afterwards), there doesn't seem to be quite enough there.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Live by Night is solid enough entertainment, but it lacks the nasty edge or narrative muscularity to make it memorable.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a C, writing: \\"Ultimately, Live by Night doesn't suggest Affleck's lost his groove so much as that his groove has its limits. Saddled with derivative material, he can't seem to find a fresh approach.\\"  References   External links  Category:2016 films Category:2016 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ben Affleck Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Pearl Street Films films Category:Appian Way Productions films Category:Films set in Tampa, Florida Category:Films about criminals Category:Films about the Irish Mob Category:Films about the Ku Klux Klan Category:Films produced by Leonardo DiCaprio Category:Films shot in Boston Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films shot in Massachusetts Category:Films scored by Harry Gregson-Williams Category:Films based on works by Dennis Lehane Category:2016 drama films Category:Films with screenplays by Ben Affleck ja:Â§ú„Å´Áîü„Åç„Çã#Êò†Áîª ","title":"Live by Night (film)"},{"id":"43742243","text":"The Attic (, also known as The Penthouse) is a 1962 Italian comedy film directed by Gianni Puccini.

Location The Broch of Burrian is located on the southern tip of North Ronaldsay in the Orkney Islands. The broch stands on a small headland next to a rocky shoreline. It is separated from the hinterland by a series of defensive earthworks. Description The broch has an external diameter of 18 metres and an internal diameter of 9.5 metres. The entrance passage is on the southeast side, and the walls are solid. There is a small room in the inner wall of the broch on the northeast side. The broch is surrounded by outer defences consisting of the remains of four concentric ramparts on the landward side. Excavations The Broch of Burrian was excavated by William Traill, proprietor of the island, in 1870 and 1871. A large number of artefacts, including a significant quantity of worked bone objects, were discovered. In addition, a number of artefacts of early historic or Pictish date were found. These include a cross-slab with ogham inscription, painted pebbles and part of an iron bell of Celtic type. Part of a Pictish house was uncovered to the north east side of the broch. The finds are now in the National Museum of Scotland. The evidence suggests two phases of occupation, both dating to the Iron Age. In the second phase, the broch was converted into a sort of wheelhouse. The second phase went on for a long time, as there were clear Pictish elements among the finds, from as late as the 7th to the 9th centuries AD. Two items (the cross-slab and the iron bell) suggest early Christian activity, although there is as yet no other evidence for monastic settlement.

A significant quantity of the cellulose humans consume is not metabolized by gut microbes and therefore cannot be considered a MAC. The amount of dietary MACs found within a food source will differ for each individual, since which carbohydrates are metabolized depends upon the composition of each person‚Äôs microbiota. For example, many Japanese individuals possess the genes for the consumption of the algal polysaccharide porphyran in their microbiomes, which are rarely found in North American and European individuals. For individuals who harbor such a porphyran-degrading strain, porphyran would be a MAC. However, porphyran would not be a MAC for those without a microbiota adaptation to seaweed. In similar fashion, germ- free mice without a microbiota might consume a diet with large quantities of potential MACs, but none of the carbohydrates would be considered MACs, since they would escape the digestive tract without being metabolized by microbes. Lack of dietary MACs results in a microbiota reliant upon endogenous host- derived MACs, such as mucin glycans. Different host genotypes can influence the identity of MACs available to the microbiota in multiple ways. For example, a host's genes may affect the level of mucus structures, such as the absence of alpha-1-2 fucose residues in the mucus of nonsecretor individuals who lack alpha-1-2- fucosyltransferase activity in the intestine. Similarly, a host may have genes that can determine the efficiency of digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. For example, lactose is accessible to the microbiota in people who are lactose intolerant, and should therefore be considered a MAC for those individuals. For nursing infants, dietary MACs that are naturally found in breast milk are known as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). For formula-fed infants, dietary MACs, such as galacto-oligosaccharides, are artificially added to formula. Therefore the research, discussion and quantification of MACs and their impact on a host's microbiota may be critical to determining their impact on human health.  Gut microbiota diversity  Diets in developed countries have lost microbiota- accessible carbohydrates which is the cause of a substantial depletion of gut microbiota taxa. This loss of microbiota diversity is likely involved in the increasing propensity for a broad range of inflammatory diseases, such as allergic disease, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Rural human communities from South America and Africa have a low prevalence of NCDs and this fact has been related with a higher gut microbiota diversity. Some of these lost taxa belong to the families of Bacteroidales (Bacteroides fragilis, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, B. distasonis, Parabacteroides gordonii), Clostridiales (Ruminococcus gnavus, Blautia producta, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and Verrucomicrobiales (Akkermansia muciniphila). Introduction of dietary MACs in the diet is insufficient to regain the lost taxa, to restore the gut microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing taxa ,which can be achieved either by administering probiotics (food) or live biotherapeutics (drugs), in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Enriching the food supply with dietary fiber might have an essential role in preventing loss of certain beneficial bacterial species.

Etymology Rellenitos de pl√°tano utilizes two of the most prevalent foods in the Latin American culture, black beans, known as frijoles negros in Spanish, and ripe plantains or pl√°tanos. Rellenito comes from the verb rellenar which means to stuff or fill. The suffix ito in Spanish is known as a diminutive. Hence rellenitos de pl√°tano could be translated as \\"little stuffed plantain things\\". Preparation To prepare rellenitos, plantains are cut into medium-sized pieces and boiled with cinnamon until tender. Once they are tender, normally after about ten minutes of cooking time they are removed, mashed into a paste and set aside to cool. The paste is then formed into a small thick tortilla by hand, leaving the center indented resembling a small bowl. The bowl is then filled with a mixture of black refried beans, chocolate and cinnamon. The filling itself is made by melting Guatemalan or Maya chocolate in water and then adding refried beans and cinnamon. The bowl is then closed by wrapping the ends of the tortilla until it closes, creating something that resembles an egg ‚Äî the plantain paste being the shell, with a black bean, chocolate, and cinnamon filling. The rellenito is then fried in a pan with oil until golden brown on all sides.

The Ajax is a development of the ASCOD armoured fighting vehicle used by the Spanish and Austrian armed forces. The family was originally developed by Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeug and Santa B√°rbara Sistemas in the early 1990s. Both companies were purchased by General Dynamics in the early 2000s. In 2010, General Dynamics UK was selected as the winner of the Future Rapid Effect System contract with the ASCOD Common Base Platform, beating BAE Systems' CV90 proposal. The Ajax family will be procured in a number of variants, initially planned to be in blocks, with the first vehicles planned to be delivered in 2017. Delays meant that as of January 2020, initial operating capability is expected in July 2020.  Development  Rear view of Ajax variant in October 2016 The Ajax has its origins in the Future Rapid Effect System program going back to the 1990s when the joint UK/USA TRACER program was cancelled. The purpose of the FRES program was to find a replacement for the British Army's Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) family of vehicles, which have been in service from 1971. General Dynamics UK won the contract in March 2010 after years of competition from BAE Systems. After the Ministry of Defence had selected the ASCOD 2 Common Base Platform, BAE tried to reverse the decision by offering to manufacture the CV90 at their Newcastle facility. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence awarded General Dynamics a ¬£500 million Demonstration Phase contract. General Dynamics has conducted design review work using the input of soldiers and bringing the ASCOD 2 Chassis in line with the British requirements. The Ajax program passed the \\"Preliminary Design Review\\" (PDR), initial design point in December 2012. At this stage of development, system maturity and preliminary system design were reviewed. In late 2013, the \\"Common Base Platform Critical Design Review\\" (CDR) was completed and development continued. In June 2014, the PMRS (Protected Mobility Recce Support) variant of the Scout Familyofficially completed its CDR. A \\"Mobile Test Rig\\", the precursor to a prototype, which had been undergoing rigorous testing including cold weather and Operational and Tactical (O&T;) mobility trials, as well as Accelerated Life Testing (ALT), completed system de-risking. At the DVD exhibition in 2014, the first pre-production prototype of the PMRS variant was unveiled, built at General Dynamics' facilities in Spain. Initially, the Ajax was to be procured in a number of blocks totalling 1,010 vehicles. The first order of Block 1 vehicles encompassed Scout Reconnaissance, PMRS APC, and Repair and Recovery variants, with Reconnaissance, C2, and Ambulance variants to follow in a Block 2, order. There was even a possibility for a third Block of vehicles encompassing a \\"Direct Fire\\" vehicle with a 120mm main gun, \\"Manoeuvre Support\\", and a \\"Joint Fires\\" variant equipped to succeed the FV102 Striker in the anti-tank role. However, in September 2014 Block 3 vehicles were dropped and the Ministry of Defence had \\"no plans\\" to order any Block 2 vehicles. On 3 September 2014, the British Government ordered 589 Scout SV vehicles, totaling a cost of ¬£3.5 billion excluding VAT. A number of Block 2 variants were merged into the Block 1 order, which still encompassed the planned 589 vehicles. Pre-production prototype of the Ares (PMRS variant) The variants ordered include: *245 turreted 'Ajax' variants **198 Reconnaissance and Strike (Ajax) **23 Joint Fire Control (Ajax) **24 Ground Based Surveillance (Ajax) *256 Protected Mobility Recce Support (PMRS) variants **93 Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) (Ares) **112 Command and Control (Athena) **34 Formation Reconnaissance Overwatch (Ares) **51 Engineer Reconnaissance (Argus) *88 Engineering variants based on the PMRS **38 Recovery vehicles (Atlas) **50 Repair vehicles (Apollo) Deliveries to the British Army began in 2017; the last deliveries were scheduled for around 2026. In July 2015, the Ministry of Defence concluded their study into having final assembly of the Scout SV vehicles take place in the UK rather than General Dynamics' primary production facility in Spain. There was a business case for UK final assembly and testing. As part of a ¬£390 million maintenance package running until 2024, General Dynamics moved production of the last 489 vehicles to Britain.\\"Scout SV to be assembled in UK\\" Jane's General Dynamics bought a former forklift factory in Pentrebach in South Wales to assemble the Scout SV. Thales UK won the sight system contract for the Scout family, safeguarding engineering and manufacturing jobs at their site in Scotland.\\"Thales UK receives Scout SV sights subcontract\\" Jane's In early August 2015, Rheinmetall of Germany was contracted to manufacture the Scout SV turrets. Meggitt was to manufacture the Scout SV ammunition handling system. On 15 September 2015, Scout was renamed Ajax. The name Ajax appliedy to the family as a whole, but also to the turreted variant specifically. The reconnaissance support variant was named Ares; the command-and-control variant was named Athena; the equipment repair vehicle was named Apollo; the equipment recovery variant was named Atlas; and the engineering reconnaissance variant was named Argus. In April 2016, the main cannon and chain gun were fired successfully. In December 2016, successful manned firing tests of the three machine guns which can be fitted to the Ares vehicle took place. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) developed the Griffin II light tank and Griffin III IFV, based on Ajax. In 2019, GDLS offered the Grffin II to the US Army for its Mobile Protected Firepower program, and the Griffin III for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program (to replace the M2/M3 Bradley). Design Ajax prototype in March 2016 The Ajax is manufactured and designed by General Dynamics UK and General Dynamics Santa B√°rbara Sistemas (Spain), with the new turret and fire control system fitted on the Reconnaissance variant being designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin UK. Lockheed Martin is working closely with the Defence Support Group for turret manufacture and assembly as well as Rheinmetall. 75% of turret and CT40 work will be carried out in the UK. The turret ring is 1.7m in diameter, allowing for much more work-space than comparable AFVs. The Scout SV is also equipped with a state of the art ISTAR package with advanced sensors and space for further future growth. This advanced ISTAR package allows for automated search, tracking and detection, more than doubling stand- off range at which targets can be identified and tracked. The Ajax has a 20 Gbit/s Ethernet intelligent open architecture, which enables it to capture, process and store six TBs of information gathered by the sensors. It can then share this data, be it images or other information, via a real-time integrated BOWMAN communication system as fitted to the Challenger 2. Power for these systems comes from a silent auxiliary power generator. 80% of the vehicle manufacture will be completed in the UK, with 70% of the supply chain companies UK-based. Five pre-production prototypes will be produced in Spain for further development and testing. The Ajax family will support 300 jobs at General Dynamics UK's facility in South Wales and an estimated further 1000 jobs in the UK supply chain. Service history The first delivery is scheduled for 2017, while the first British Army squadron \\"will be equipped by mid-2019\\" so that they could be deployed by the end of 2020.

Its mission was ‚Äúto make the Church relevant to the needs of the black community; to assist generally in the black liberation movement; to assist black Catholics in their efforts to become self-determining; and to become an effective voice in the whole of Church government.‚Äù NOBC was founded in 1970, as an umbrella group for the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus (NBCCC), the National Black Sisters Conference (NBSC), and the National Black Lay Catholic Caucus (NBLCC). However, tension over the mission and organizational structure of the organization led to the formal withdrawal of the NBSC and NBCCC from NOBC in the early 1980s. Funding for the NOBC came primarily from an annual collection taken at Catholic churches around the country, called ‚ÄúBlack Catholics Concerned.‚Äù NOBC undertook a variety of programs in the 1970s and 1980s. Its major departments included the Office of Culture and Worship, Office of Evangelization, Department of Church Vocations, and Education Department. The organization‚Äôs work included promoting black clerical leadership, supporting the development of African-rooted liturgy and ministries, contributing to the revitalization of black parishes, and strengthening black Catholic education. The organization also worked with the American Catholic hierarchy to bring issues around race to the forefront and participated in the 1976 ‚ÄúCall to Action‚Äù conference held by the U.S. bishops. NOBC sponsored many conferences and events throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Among its most successful events was a regular conference on African American Culture and Worship (AACW). Beginning in 1980, it also hosted a biennial conference for the organization‚Äôs members. In 1988 and 1989, NOBC and NBLCC hosted two Lay Leadership symposiums in Belleville, Illinois. The Office of Evangelization also sponsored revival events throughout the country. The NOBC‚Äôs publications included its newsletter, Impact!, as well as Freeing the Spirit, a newsletter of the Office of Culture and Worship. Freeing the Spirit ceased publication in 1983, but Impact! continued sporadic publication through the 1980s. Executive directors of the NOBC included: Br. Joseph Davis, SM (1970-1977), Fr. Cyprian Lamar Rowe, SSF (1978-1980), James Henderson (1981-1987), Penelope Taylor Powell (1978 [acting director], 1987-1988), and Walter Hubbard (1988-c. 2000). Although the NOBC continued its activity through the 1990s and early 2000s, its level of activity seems to have decreased.Yockey, Roger (2007).

It is located along an ancient course of the Magalloway River in an area that is occasionally under the waters of the man-made Aziscohos Lake. The site was discovered in 1979, and has been the subject of several archaeological excavations since then. The site includes at least eight encampment areas (tent sites) and a significant kill zone where the Native Americans killed a large number of caribou. A section of the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980; this listing was enlarged to in 1984. Description Six of the eight tent sites excavated in 1980 exhibited significant evidence of tool work and a number of well- shaped stone projectile points. The other two tent sites were located closer to the ancient river channel, and may have been subject to flooding. These sites are estimated to have supported a population of 36 to 60 individuals, and are believed to have been occupied for only 8 to 10 years. They were laid out in an arc measuring about in length. Finds at these tent sites are closely correlated to finds at the kill site, which was located on the opposite shore of the ancient channel. The site is believed to have been occupied by Paleo- Indians about 13,000 years ago. The ten-year occupation period is consistent with the practices of Alaskan Natives in historic times, who would occupy camps for a similar time period, abandoning them when the caribou herd that traversed the area was depleted.

Coming with his father to Lockport, Illinois work on the Illinois & Michigan Canal, Singer rose to become superintendent of repairs. In the course of his work, he came across a large quarry near Lemont, Illinois and established a company to mine it. Singer & Talcott was in operation until 1889. In 1866, Singer served a term in the Illinois House of Representatives, then was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in the 1870s. Biography Singer was born on October 1, 1823, in Schenectady, New York. When he was two, his family moved to Ashtabula County, Ohio. In 1836, they moved to Lockport, Illinois. His father was a canal and harbor laborer and came to work on the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Horace assisted his father with the construction of section 64 of that canal from 1836 to 1840. When the state ceased to provide funds for further construction in 1840, Singer took a job teaming, transporting passengers and freight within Illinois and Indiana. When construction resumed in 1845, Singer was appointed an engineer. In 1848, he was named superintendent of canal repairs, serving for four years. While working on the canal, Horace and his father were joined by Horace's uncle, Isaac Singer, the inventor. While overseeing repairs, a large stratified dolomite quarry was found near Lemont, Illinois. He resigned as commissioner in 1852 to found H. M. Singer & Co. to develop the quarry. Singer was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1866, serving a two-year term. He accepted Mancel Talcott as partner in 1854 and the firm became known as Singer & Talcott. The operation was officially incorporated as the Singer & Talcott Stone Company in the early 1870s. Around this time he was named to the Cook County Board of Commissioners and in 1874, Singer largely withdrew from company affairs. The company was sold in 1889 to the Western Stone Company. Singer was chairman of the committee overseeing the construction of the Cook County Criminal Court Building. Singer was on the board of directors of the First National Bank of Chicago. He held stock in the Central Music Hall and served on its finance and executive committees. He was a member of the Union League Club of Chicago and the Calumet Club. Singer married Harriet A. Roberts on April 6, 1847. They had three sons: Edward T., Charles G., and Walter H. He died in Will County on December 28, 1896 and was buried in Lockport Cemetery.

Shortly before Carrie's arrival, Sandy leaves the embassy with no protection so he can meet with his secret source.

She does her best to care for Frannie but also confesses to the baby that with Brody dead, she can't remember why she gave birth to her. Later, while giving her a bath, Carrie loses her grip on Frannie, who is momentarily submerged. Carrie then holds Frannie's head dangerously close to the water for several seconds before hurriedly yanking her out of the bathtub. Quinn struggles to cope with recent events.

To get him to stay, Carrie has to warn him that both the CIA and ISI are actively hunting him. Later that day, Carrie conducts her first interview of Aayan. She delves into Aayan's relationship with his uncle, Haissam Haqqani (Numan Acar).

En route to the United States, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) sees Farhad Ghazi at Benazir Bhutto International Airport. Following Ghazi into a bathroom, Saul is attacked by two other men and given an injection which renders him unconscious. Saul is taken out of the airport in a wheelchair.
