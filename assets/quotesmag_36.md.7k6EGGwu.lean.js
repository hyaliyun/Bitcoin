Early life Born on 22 April 1863 at Osborne Terrace, Clapham Road, London, he was second son of Robert Henry Boyce, originally of Carlow, Ireland, an engineer and surveyor of British buildings in China, and his wife Louisa, daughter of Dr. Neligan, a medical practitioner in Athlone. After attending a preparatory school in Rugby, Warwickshire, and then a school in Paris, he began as a medical student at University College, London. He graduated M.B. of London University in 1889. Academic organiser In 1892 Boyce was appointed assistant professor of pathology at University College, London. In 1894 he was appointed to the newly endowed chair of pathology of University College, Liverpool, then a constituent of Victoria University, Manchester. At Liverpool he organised a laboratory of scientific pathology: in 1898 it was installed in a new building, and at the same time he was appointed bacteriologist to the Liverpool corporation. Boyce advocated the development and expansion of the College into an autonomous university. As an officer there and of the municipality he was able to forward the creation of Liverpool University, which was established in 1902. Four of its endowed chairs owed their creation mainly to him: those of biochemistry, of tropical medicine, of comparative pathology, and of medical entomology. This was in addition to a university lectureship on tropical medicine. In 1897 Boyce visited Canada with the British Association. A fellowship for young medical graduates from the colonies was then endowed at Liverpool University. Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine In 1898 Joseph Chamberlain, as secretary of state for the colonies, proposed that the school of medicine at Liverpool should establish a department for the study of tropical diseases. Boyce, with Alfred Lewis Jones, then founded the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, of which Ronald Ross became director, the post being shortly associated with an endowed chair at the university. In 1901 Boyce took the lead in organising a series of expeditions sent by the School to the tropics to investigate diseases. In six years there were 17 expeditions, costly in terms of life and money. In 1905 Boyce went himself to New Orleans and British Honduras to examine epidemics of yellow fever. Later life Recognition came Boyce's way. He was made a fellow of University College, London, in June 1902 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1906 he was knighted. He became a member of the African advisory board of the Colonial Office, and served on royal commissions on sewage disposal and on tuberculosis. In September 1906 he suffered a stroke of paralysis. After a year he partially resumed his university work, although he was permanently disabled. In 1909 Boyce visited the West Indies to report for the government on yellow fever, and in 1910 he went to West Africa on a similar mission. The last of his projects was the formation at Liverpool of a bureau of yellow fever. The first number of its bulletin was sent to press just before his death. He died of an apoplectic seizure on 16 June 1911, at Park Lodge, Croxteth Road, Liverpool, and was buried at Bebington cemetery, Wirral, Cheshire. Works In 1892 Boyce published A Text-book of Morbid Histology. From this time he wrote papers on pathology and tropical sanitation for the Royal Pathological Society, and other scientific bodies. He was joint author with John Hill Abram of Handbook of Pathological Anatomy (1895). Later he wrote more popular accounts, which were influential: * Mosquito or Man (1909; 3rd edit. 1910); * Health Progress and Administration in the West Indies (1910; 2nd edit. 1910); and * Yellow Fever and its Prevention (1911). Family Boyce married in 1901 Kate Ethel (died 1902), daughter of William Johnston, a Liverpool shipowner, of Woodslee, Bromborough, Cheshire, and left one daughter.

They are related to centrality indices. Applications include measuring the influence of each person in a social network, understanding the role of infrastructure nodes in transportation networks, the Internet, or urban networks, and the participation of a given node in disease dynamics.  Origin and development  The traditional approach to understanding node importance is via centrality indicators. Centrality indices are designed to produce a ranking which accurately identifies the most influential nodes. Since the mid 2000s, however, social scientists and network physicists have begun to question the suitability of centrality indices for understanding node influence. Centralities may indicate the most influential nodes, but they are rather less informative for the vast majority of nodes which are not highly influential. Borgatti and Everett's 2006 review article showed that the accuracy of centrality indices is highly dependent on network topology. This finding has been repeatedly observed since then. (e.g. ). In 2012, Bauer and colleagues reminded us that centrality indices only rank nodes but do not quantify the difference between them. In 2013, Sikic and colleagues presented strong evidence that centrality indices considerably underestimate the power of non-hub nodes. The reason is quite clear. The accuracy of a centrality measure depends on network topology, but complex networks have heterogenous topology. Hence a centrality measure which is appropriate for identifying highly influential nodes will most likely be inappropriate for the remainder of the network. This has inspired the development of novel methods designed to measure the influence of all network nodes. The most general of these are the accessibility, which uses the diversity of random walks to measure how accessible the rest of the network is from a given start node, and the expected force, derived from the expected value of the force of infection generated by a node. Both of these measures can be meaningfully computed from the structure of the network alone.  Accessibility  The Accessibility is derived from the theory of random walks. It measures the diversity of self- avoiding walks which start from a given node. A walk on a network is a sequence of adjacent vertices; a self-avoiding walk visits (lists) each vertex at most once. The original work used simulated walks of length 60 to characterize the network of urban streets in a Brazilian city. It was later formalized as a modified form of hierarchical degree which controls for both transmission probabilities and the diversity of walks of a given fixed length. = Definition = The hierarchical degree measures the number of nodes reachable from a start node by performing walks of length h. For a fixed h and walk type, each of these neighbors is reached with a (potentially different) probability p_j^{(h)}. Given a vector of such probabilities, the accessibility of node i at scale h is defined :\\\\kappa_i^{(h)} = \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\sum_j p_j^{(h)} \\\\log p_j^{(h)} \\\\right) The probabilities can be based on uniform- probability random walks, or additionally modulated by edge weights and/or explicit (per edge) transmission probabilities. = Applications = The accessibility has been shown to reveal community structure in urban networks, corresponds to the number of nodes which can be visited in a defined time period, and is predictive of the outcome of epidemiological SIR model spreading processes on networks with large diameter and low density.  Expected force  The expected force measures node influence from an epidemiological perspective. It is the expected value of the force of infection generated by the node after two transmissions. = Definition = The expected force of a node i is given by :\\\\kappa_i = - \\\\sum_{j=1}^J d_j \\\\log(d_j) where the sum is taken over the set J of all possible transmission clusters resulting from two transmissions starting from i, and d_j is the normalized cluster degree of cluster j \\\\in J. The definition naturally extends to directed networks by limiting the enumeration J by edge direction. Likewise, extension to weighted networks, or networks with heterogeneous transmission probabilities, is a matter of adjusting the normalization of d_j to include the probability that that cluster forms. It is also possible to use more than two transmissions to define the set J. = Applications = The expected force has been shown to strongly correlate with SI, SIS, and SIR epidemic outcomes over a broad range of network topologies, both simulated and empirical. It has also been used to measure the pandemic potential of world airports, and mentioned in the context of digital payments, ecology, fitness, and project management.  Other approaches  Others suggest metrics which explicitly encode the dynamics of a specified process unfolding on the network. The dynamic influence is the proportion of infinite walks starting from each node, where walk steps are scaled such that the linear dynamics of the system are expected to converge to a non-null steady state. The Impact sums, over increasing walk lengths, the probability of transmission to the end node of the walk and that the end node has not been previously visited by a shorter walk. While both measures well predict the outcome of the dynamical systems they encode, in each case the authors admit that results from one dynamic do not translate to other dynamics.

An alliance between Thailand and Japan was formally signed on 21 December 1941. On 25 January 1942, the Thai government, believing the Allies beaten, declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom. As a reward for entering into a military alliance with the Japanese, the latter agreed to return to Thailand the four British Malayan provinces of Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu which had been ceded to the British under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. After occupation on 20 August 1943, an agreement on the surrender of the four states was signed in Bangkok, between Phibunsongkhram and the Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tonbukami. Among the conditions found in the agreement it was stated that Japan would hand over the administration of the four Malay states to Thailand within 60 days after the signature of the document.Saiburi Samuk On 18 October 1943, the four Malay states were transferred to Thailand.

General information The Lukovo Pole Hydroelectric Power Plant is a planned project. It is intended to be located 100km southwest of Skopje, Macedonia, near to the country's western border with Albania, in the Mavrovo National Park area of the Korab mountain range. The plan envisages the construction of a covered feeder channel (approximately 20km long) at an altitude of 1,500m. This will channel the flow of several tributaries of the Radika river into a reservoir through a pipe system. In this way, it will provide additional flow of water to existing hydroelectric power plants. The reservoir will be supported by a 71m-high dam at Lukovo Pole; it will have a storage capacity of about 39 million cubic meters. The slopes of the reservoir will have moderate to low inclination, meaning that instability is unlikely. Approximately 3.5km downhill from the dam, a small hydroelectric power plant will be constructed with an installed capacity of 5 megawatts (MW). The preliminary design for this power plant envisions two Francis turbines, each with an installed capacity of 2.5 MW. Ownership and financing The project will be implemented by Elektrani Na Makedonija (ELEM), a state-owned electric utility. This company was formed in 2005 and currently carries out mining operations in four different coal mines. Its current maximum power generation capacity is 1,329 MW, 60% of which comes from coal- fired plants and 40% from existing hydroelectric power plants. The total cost of this project is estimated to be US$83 million, of which US$70 million will be provided by a loan from the World Bank.Information on Lukovo Pole Water Regulation and Renewable Energy Project. Retrieved 28 August 2014. Controversial issues The Mavrovo National Park is an area which contains diverse fauna and flora and a relatively untouched landscape. The area around the project site has been identified as a potential World Heritage site by an international delegation of expects: it is characterized by the \\"richest and most beautiful parts of the national park,\\" with a large amount of plant biodiversity which makes it a valuable site for researchers specialising in Europe¬¥s plant species. According to PlantLife, this project would affect 17 threatened plant species, including the endemic fritillary Fritillaria, the macedonica and the Narthecium scardicum. In order to facilitate the implementation of this project, the area specifically intended for the construction work was downgraded from a strictly prohibited area to an area with sustainable use: this is the lowest possible level of protection, and allows construction work to take place on the site. Preliminary assessments of the project indicate that the proposed project would only have a limited impact on the amount of water diverted from the Radika River. However, several NGOs claim that the loss of water will be a problem for sustaining life in the park. This project will require extensive hydrological engineering in a high- altitude valley with unfavorable geological conditions. These geological problems include landslides, leaking materials and the permanent presence of water. Therefore, substantial adjustments will be needed in order to complete the construction work successfully. Large-scale construction of canals and service roads might well cause a substantial disturbance to the Balkan lynx, which is a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx. In addition, it has been alleged that this project is in breach of international law: it violates the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the Bonn convention and the Convention on Biological diversity, all of which have been ratified by the Republic of Macedonia.

The time zone is 3 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+03:00) with no daylight savings. SAST is defined by the 45th Meridian East. Before a standardized time zone was introduced, the country used Arabic time, in which clocks were set to midnight at sundown. Because of confusion between various other systems also used in the kingdom, the standardized use of a time zone was established. History Until 1968, Saudi Arabia used Arabic time, where clocks were set to 12 o'clock at sunset or when the call to prayer for the sunset prayer was heard. This was because the Islamic calendar defines sunset as marking the beginning of a new day. However this later conflicted with the introduction of western sun time, which defined, in congruence with Europe, the start of a new day to be midnight. With western sun time, clocks were set to six o'clock at sun set. While western sun time was intended to be approximately equal to GMT+3, it being reliant on sunset time, which changed with the seasons, meant that large disparity could emerge between western sunset time and GMT+3 as seasons progressed. In addition to this, the American Military Assistance Advisory Group introduced \\"Zulu time\\" which was aligned with GMT+4. Saudi Air used GMT+3 for most of the country, except for Dahran which was set at GMT+4. The American Arabian Oil Company, used to also observe daylight savings for its headquarters in Dahran. Similarly, the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company also observed daylight savings for its pumps in the east of the country. The kingdom adopted a standardized time zone, three hours ahead of GMT (GMT+3) on 14 March, 1947 (according to IANA's tz database).

In 1909, the Alaska Pacific Steamship Company acquired the Admiral Sampson and its sister ship, the Admiral Farragut, as a result of its growing business on the West Coast shipping routes. Both ships were placed on the San Francisco-Puget Sound shipping route. In 1912, the Alaska Pacific Steamship Company acquired the remaining Admiral-class steamships and merged with the Alaska Coast Company to form the Pacific-Alaska Navigation Company. The new company offered freight and passenger service between San Francisco and Puget Sound and Alaska ports as far north as Nome.  Collision and sinking  On the morning of August 26, 1914, the Admiral Sampson left Seattle en route to Juneau, Alaska with 126 passengers and crew aboard. Visibility was poor because of fog; the ship's captain, Zimro Moore, ordered a slow crawl of 3 knots, extra lookouts and the ship's whistle sounded at regular intervals. At the same time, the steamship Princess Victoria was inbound to Seattle with similar precautions in place. Despite both ships' precautions, the Princess Victoria rammed the Admiral Sampson at approximately 5:46 a.m. near Point No Point, 18 miles north of Seattle.\\"Liner Admiral Sampson Rammed and Sunk in Sound; Eleven Dead,\\" The Seattle Star. Aug. 26, 1914. Page 1. The Princess Victoria struck the Admiral Sampson broadside, near the Admiral Sampsons after hatch, a spot about midway between amidships and the ship's stern. Capt. P.J. Hickey of the Princess Victoria kept his ship's engines ahead and pushed the Princess Victoria into the gash torn into the hull of the Admiral Sampson. This action both reduced the amount of water rushing into the hole and allowed some of the Admiral Sampsons passengers and crew to evacuate onto the Princess Victoria. Princess Victorias crew lowered their ship's lifeboats to aid the Admiral Sampsons passengers and crew, as it was apparent that the latter ship was sinking. Capt. Moore ordered the same action aboard the Admiral Sampson, but only two boats could be lowered in time.Norton, Dee. \\"Robot To Snag Items From Sunken Ship,\\" The Seattle Times. Sept. 24, 1994.

In addition to tearing a gash that stretched below the Admiral Sampsons waterline, the impact of the Princess Victoria ruptured an oil tank aboard the Admiral Sampson and started a fire. The Princess Victoria was forced to pull away and the Admiral Sampson sank, about 15 minutes after the collision. All told, 114 passengers and crew members were saved. Eight crew members, including Capt. Moore, and three passengers drowned. One injured crew member died later in a hospital.  Casualties  The wireless operators of both ships transmitted SOS signals constantly. Aboard the Admiral Sampson, wireless operator Walter E. Reker transmitted emergency messages and helped passengers board lifeboats; he then joined his captain on the bridge. Reker and Capt. Moore went down with the ship.Baarslag, Karl. SOS to the Rescue. Oxford University Press, 1935. Reker‚Äôs name was added to the Wireless Operators Memorial in New York City‚Äôs Battery Park. His name is near that of Jack Phillips, who died from exposure after the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The Wireless World reported in April 1915: ‚ÄúAs the cargo of his vessel consisted of oil, the horrors of fire were super-added to the situation and Reker found too much work to do to think of his own safety. He shared the fate of the captain side by side with him on the bridge.‚Äù Telegraph and Telephone Age reported on May 16, 1915: ‚ÄúIt is proof of the bravery and efficiency of the crew that [most] passengers were saved. Reker might have saved himself by taking to the boats with the passengers and the greater part of the crew. He remained at the wireless telegraph key, however, giving direction to the rescuing ship which proved invaluable. He ignored repeated appeals from the boats to save himself. When the last boat had left safely, Reker reported to the bridge and remained to share the fate of the captain. It proved to be too late for them to leave and eight of the men, including the wireless telegraph operator, went down with the ship.‚Äùhttps://www.nwyachting.com/2018/10/disaster-at-point-no-point/ A large crowd met the Princess Victoria when it reached the Canadian Pacific Railroad wharf shortly after 10 a.m. The Princess Victoria had a gash two or three feet above the waterline, extending back from the bow. ‚ÄúHer decks were crowded with people, half of them well-dressed and the other half with only fragments of clothing protecting them from the cold,‚Äù the Seattle Star reported. ‚ÄúA gaping wound loomed large in the vessel‚Äôs bow, only two or three feet above the water line ‚Ä¶ In the breech hung a battered hatch cover from the Admiral Sampson.‚Äùhttps://www.nwyachting.com/2018/10/disaster-at-point-no-point/ A roll call revealed the names of those killed. * Passenger Ruby Whitson Banbury, who had married the previous October. * Passenger George Bryant, a printer headed to Alaska to seek employment. * Passenger John McLaughlin, who was last seen clinging to the ship‚Äôs rigging as the Admiral Sampson sank. * Ship‚Äôs cook L.

Salvage  The wreck of the Admiral Sampson remained undisturbed for 80 years, owing to its depth and the difficulty of a salvage operation. In 1991, Gary Severson and Kent Barnard used side-scan sonar to locate the Admiral Sampsons resting place. The following year, the two men obtained exclusive salvage rights for the ship. They began diving on the wreck with a small, two-man submarine and retrieved artifacts, including the ship's whistle. The wreck rests about 320 feet below the surface of Puget Sound, directly under a major shipping route. The hull lies in two pieces, having broken apart either as it sank or shortly after it hit bottom. In 1994, the two men expressed hopes that they might find the ship's safe, which was believed to contain a valuable diamond necklace. Another potential prize was a suitcase containing gold brought aboard by a passenger. The search failed to discover the safe, but the salvagers did recover the ship's engine order telegraph and various galley equipment. Since the pioneering dives in the early 1990s, the Admiral Sampson has become a destination for a handful of technically advanced and experienced divers. Owing to its depth and location, it is believed that fewer than 15 divers visited the Admiral Sampson before 2005. Diving the Admiral Sampson remains a highly technical and involved experience. Owing to its location in Puget Sound shipping lanes, coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard is required.Williams, Randy. \\"SS Admiral Sampson Deep Dive,\\" scubadiving.com. July 25, 2005.

Career Born in Metz, he wrote the libretto for Gluck's opera Echo et Narcisse and with Fran√ßois-Louis Gand Le Bland Du Roullet co-wrote the libretto for Salieri's Les Dana√Ødes. He later served as Councillor to the Prince de Li√®ge.Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Louis-Th√©odore de Tschudi. Retrieved 28 August 2014 . Tschudi contributed many articles on horticulture and natural history to the supplementary volumes of the Encyclop√©die. He influenced the views of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In a 1790 letter to Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, Lamarck noted that the articles written by Tschudi \\"contain observations, even in great numbers, which I have used to advantage and which I shall not ignore.\\"Stafleu, Frans A. (1971). Lamarck: The Birth of Biology. Taxon 20 (4): 397-442. In a 1777 article in the Encyclop√©die that influenced Lamarck, he analysed the effect of climate and soil on transplants. According to science historian Richard W. Burkhardt: > Tschoudi observed that a plant's habitude had to be altered gradually if > transplantation were to be successful. Organic changes occur, he said, as > the result of factors that operate gradually and continually upon supple > organs. He did not doubt that such acquired changes could be passed down to > succeeding generations. He discussed the production of new varieties through > hybridization.Burkhardt, Richard W. (1995). The Spirit of System: Lamarck > and Evolutionary Biology. Harvard University Press. p. 90. Tschudi in his garden in Colombey planted many exotic plants and published articles and memoirs on agriculture and artificial grassland, the culture of alfalfa, the cultivation of forests and the utility of their planting, on trees and various plants. He wrote botanical articles in the Yverdon Encyclopedia. Tschoudi converted the area around Colombey Castle into a park. He had planted trees from Asia, Africa and America at great expense.

Cast *Manoj Nandam as Sreenu *Priyanka Pallavi as Bindu *Satyanand as Bindu's uncle Reception The film received moderate reviews from critic. Deccan Chronicle wrote \\"The director‚Äôs aim is good, but the way the story has been depicted on screen is not convincing. Maybe he has targeted only college students and youth and not kept family audiences in mind. That‚Äôs why unlike his earlier films, ‚ÄòOka Criminal Prema Katha‚Äô fails to make an impact. The publicity posters and his earlier films may bring in college youth, but this film is definitely not for all.\\" Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating \\"Oka Criminal Prema Katha does not offer any direct message to the audience. Indirectly, the movie shows that the parents, who are the first role models to their children, are responsible for the kind of behavior the youth have. Though the director has tried out something different, but he has failed to give a convincing picture on screen.\\" 123telugu.com gave a review stating \\"On the whole, Oka Criminal Prema Katha sends out the intended message very loud and clear. The way today‚Äôs women and youth face problems in the society has been showcased nicely. But the way it has been narrated in a non commercial format, and with a bit of harsh reality will not be liked by one and all\\" and rated the film 2.5/5. IndiaGlitz gave a review stating \\"Technically, it‚Äôs quite mediocre but the narration manages to make a mark. At a time when even supposedly pro-women films parade profanity and obscenity under the pretext of exposing the vulgarity and mean-mindedness of lecherous men, this film is praiseworthy in that bold scenes have a meaningful presence.

It was founded in 2002 by a fusion of the Sint-Josephziekenhuis in Veldhoven and the Diaconessenhuis in Eindhoven, and was named after Maxima of the Netherlands. The main location is in Veldhoven, with the location in Eindhoven serving for non-critical care. It is the second biggest hospital in the Eindhoven region, after the Catharina Ziekenhuis in Eindhoven.  History  = Sint-Josephziekenhuis = Plans for the Sint-Josephziekenhuis had existed since 1915. Building started in 1930 at the Aalsterweg in Eindhoven, and it opened on 9 June 1932. It was designed by architect Eduard Cuypers and had 200 beds. During the second world war the building was used for injured German troops. In 1991 the hospital relocated to Veldhoven, to its current location. = Diaconessenhuis = In the early 20th century the city of Eindhoven, located in the Roman Catholic area of the Netherlands, had two mainly Roman Catholic hospitals, the Binnenziekenhuis en the Sint- Josephziekenhuis. During this period, Protestants from the rest of the country, relocated to Eindhoven, to work at Philips, causing a growth of the Protestant population. Since 1929 the \\"Vereeniging voor Protestantsch- Christelijke Ziekenverpleging\\" (English: Association for Protestant-Christian Patient Care) had put in effort to get a Protestant hospital. In 1933 an emergency hospital was opened in a villa at the Parklaan in Eindhoven, mainly by the efforts of Phillipes headnurse Johanna Kleinod, and with financial support of dr. Anton Philips, who wanted the best medical care for all his employees, no matter what their religious orientation. With 20 beds it was soon found too small and in 1935 Villa Elsheim was bought with financial support of Philips. The new hospital, with 90 beds and a modern Rontgen department, was opened on 13 January 1940. In the 1950s the hospital was once again too small and in April 1967 it relocated to the Ds. Fliednerlaan in Woensel, Eindhoven. In the mid 1980s the Diaconessenhuis was one of the first Dutch hospitals where laparoscopic surgery was done. It was the first Dutch hospital to perform a laparoscopic removal of a gallbladder. = M√°xima Medisch Centrum = On 1 January 2002 the Sint-Josephziekenhuis and Diaconessenhuis fused and continued under the name M√°xima Medisch Centrum. The new hospital was named after the wife of the then Dutch crown prince, Maxima of the Netherlands, who married that same year. On 1 September 2008 the services offered in the two locations was reorganised with the Veldhoven location becoming the main location for complex care, and the Eindhoven location for planned and minor care.  Healthcare  In 2012 M√°xima Medisch Centrum had 543 beds, making it the second largest hospital in the Eindhoven region, after the Catharina Ziekenhuis in Eindhoven. With 3250 employees, out of which 210 medical specialists, it provided care for 170.000 policlinical patients for a total of 450.000 policlinical consultations, 42.000 day care clinical patients, and 25.000 overnight clinical patients for a total of 105.000 overnight stays. M√°xima Medisch Centrum is a member of the \\"Vereniging Samenwerkende Topklinische Ziekenhuizen\\" (English: Association Cooperating Topclinical Hospitals), a cooperative association of the 20 largest Dutch teaching hospitals, who work together in areas of education and quality control, to guarantee the best level of healthcare. These hospitals have divided tertiary and specialist care amongst themselves, with set standards, in areas they call \\"topclinical care\\". Areas in which M√°xima Medisch Centrum offers such \\"topclinical care\\" are: * Neonatal intensive care (NICU) * Obstetric high care (OHC) * Dialysis * Hemophilia * Policlinical advise for hereditary diseases = Location Veldhoven = Location Veldhoven is the main location of M√°xima Medisch Centrum. It is used for policlinical consultations, complex surgeries, Woman Mother Child-centre, emergency care and intensive care. In 2012 Maxima of the Netherlands opened the Woman Mother Child-centre on location Veldhoven, an obstetric and neonatal high care centre where mother and child can be together during the first 24 hours after birth, even when high care is needed. = Location Eindhoven = Location Eindhoven is used for policlinical consultations, plannable care and day care patients.

During the 1980s she worked in a studio in Carpenters Road in Stratford. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Tate Gallery.  Early Work  After exhibiting her post-graduate work at Slade, she was approached by the curators of the newly opened Garage Art gallery in London. She was invited to exhibit more of her work, and created the solo exhibition 'Issues' for November 1979. Clark was inspired by Mary Douglas anthropology work on taboos and disorder, published in Purity and Danger . Clark cited from the book throughout the exhibition. She was also inspired by travel in Europe, where she saw the contemporary work of Joseph Beuys, Dieter Rot, and others. Clark also cited a TV programme exploring fictional investigations of forensic science teams as an influence. 'Issues' explores the body through Clark's collection of bodily fluids and parts, such as menstruation and hair. Clark was one of the first artists to explore menstrual blood in her art. The exhibition received an unusual amount of attention for an artist who was young and just done with art school. 'Issues' was reviewed in mainstream media by Caroline Tisdall in The Guardian and Marina Valzey in Financial Times.  Later Work  In 1990, Clark was commissioned to design a series of acoustic wall hangings' for Portcullis House, Westminster. In 1990, Clark won an Arts Council Grant for the project 'A Rare Sighting' with Cable Street Gallery, London.

Only a few communities, viz., those Jewish inhabitants who lived in the far eastern quarters of Yemen (Nihm, al-Jawf, and Khawlan of the eastThe one exception being Tan'am, which although it lies in the principality of Khawlan, was not spared the fate of exile.) were spared this fate by virtue of their Arab patrons who refused to obey the king's orders.Qafi·∏• (1958), pp. 246-286; Qafih (1989) vol. 2, p. 714 Many would die along the route and while confined to the hot and arid conditions of this forbidding terrain. After one year in exile, the exiles were called back to perform their usual tasks and labors for the indigenous Arab populations, who had been deprived of goods and services on account of their exile.Qafih (1958); Qafih (1989), vol. 2, p. 714 (end); Qorah (1988), p. 11 Background With the rise to power of the QƒÅsimƒ´d ImƒÅm, al-Mutawakkil Isma'il (1644‚Äì1676), there was a crucial turning point in the condition of Jews living under the Imamate kingdom of Yemen. He endorsed the most hostile policies toward his Jewish subjects, partly due to the claim that the Jews were aiding the Ottoman Turks during the local uprising against them.Tobi (2014), p. 6 The rise of the Shabbathian movement in Yemen in 1666 exacerbated the problems facing the community, calling into question their status as protected wards of the State. One decree led to another.One Jewish poet bewails their fate at this time, saying: \\"Since the day that they removed the turbans from our heads (i.e. 1666), we are full of orders which he decrees [against us]. He has placed over our heads [a governor] who is the master of oppression!\\" See: Ratzaby (1961), p. 378. The king initially demanded their conversion to Islam and when they refused, he made them stand out in the sun without apparel for three days, which was later followed by harsher decrees. It is said that al-Mutawakkil Isma'il consulted with the religious scholars of Islam and sought to determine whether or not the laws concerning Jews in the Arabian Peninsula applied also to Yemen, citing Muhammad who was reported as saying, \\"There shall not be two religions in Arabia.\\" When it was determined that these laws did indeed apply to Yemen, since the country was an indivisible part of the Arabian Peninsula, it then became incumbent upon Jews living in Yemen to either convert to Islam or to leave the country. Yet, since the king fell ill and was bedridden, he did not presently perform his ill-designs to expel the Jews from his kingdom, but commanded the heir to his throne, al-Mahdi Ahmad, to do so.Tobi (2014), p. 7Tobi (1999), pp. 77-79 Al-Mahdi Ahmad of al-GhirƒÅs, who is also known by the epithet ·π¢afƒ´ al-Din (purity of religion), succeeded al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, but perpetuated the same hostilities toward his Jewish subjects as those made by his predecessor. Everything reached its climax between the years 1677 and 1680, when he ordered the destruction of the synagogues in Sana'a and elsewhere.Tan·∏•um ben Joseph, of Jerusalem, al-Murshid al-kƒÅfi (in manuscript form), p. 112 (Yosef Tobi's Private Collection), we read the following marginal note: \\"The synagogue was destroyed here, [in] ·∏§amdah, on Wednesday, the 17th day of the lunar month Teveth, in the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (=1678 CE), by order of al-Mahdi and Muhammad ben Ahmad.\\" Yehudah Ratzaby (1984, p. 149) also brings down a manuscript extracted from the binding of an old book, now at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York (239), in which the author complains: \\"The razing of the synagogue of B≈´sƒÅn on the fourth day of the week which is the third day of the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (= 1678 CE), and the enemies forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of Law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees.\\" See: Tobi (1999), pp. 78 [end]-79) By early summer of 1679, he gave an ultimatum unto his Jewish subjects, namely, that they had the choice of either converting to Islam, in which they'd be allowed to remain in the country, or of being killed by the sword. He gave to them three months to decide what they would do.Qafih (1958), vol. 2, page ◊®◊°◊ë (p. 270 in PDF); Qafi·∏• (1989), vol. 2, p. 713 The king's words led to no small consternation amongst his Jewish subjects in Yemen, who immediately declared a time of public fasting and prayer, which they did both by night and day. Their plight soon became known to the local Yemeni tribesmen, whose chiefs and principal men pitied their condition and intervened on their behalf. They came before the king and enquired concerning the decree, and insisted that the Jews had been loyal to their king and had not offended the Arab peoples, neither had they done anything worthy of death, but should only be punished a little for their \\"obduracy\\" in what concerns the religion of Islam. The king, agreeing to their counsel, chose not to kill his Jewish subjects, but decided to banish them from his kingdom. They were to be sent to Zeila ª, a place along the African coast of the Red Sea, where they would be confined for life, or else repent and accept the tenets of Islam.Qafih (1958), p. ◊®◊°◊í; Qafi·∏• (1989), vol. 2, p. 714  Sana'a  The Jewish community in Sana'a was concentrated in the neighborhood of al-SƒÅ'ilah, within the walled city, as one enters Bab al- Sha ªub (the Sha ªub Gate) on Sana'a's north side. The chief rabbi of the Jewish community at that time was an elder to whom they gave the title of Prince (nasi), Rabbi Suleiman al-NaqqƒÅsh,Tobi (1986), p. 42, note 68. According to Erich Brauer, the title of nasi was conferred upon a man belonging to the community's most noble and richest family. There was no direct election for this post. In general, the nasi was also a scholar, well-versed in Torah, but this was not a condition for his office. Among his duties, he was a representative of the community in all its affairs before the government. He was also entrusted with the duty of collecting the annual poll-tax (ƒüizya), as also to settle disputes arising between members of the community. See Brauer (1934) pp. 281‚Äì282. while the city's chief seat of learning was under the tutelage of Rabbi and Judge, Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (resh methivta).Saleh (1979b), vol. 1, s.v. Sha·∏•rith shel Shabbath. Rabbi Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (1610‚Äì1690) is said to have returned to his post after the Mawza Exile, serving as both President of the court at ·π¢an'ƒÅ' and the city's spiritual instructor. He helped draft a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the Jewish community, by way of merit, and thereby hoping to prevent the recurrence of harsh decrees against the community in the future. See: Gavra (2010), vol. 1, p. 70. The Jews of Sana'a were given but short notice about the things that were about to happen to them.Rabbi Yosef Qafih believes that they were given advance warning as early as late-summer of 1678. See: Qafih (1958); Qafih (1989), vol. 2, p. 713, note 130. According to Arabic sources, ImƒÅm al-Mahdƒ´ had ordered the newly appointed governor of Sana'a, Muhammad ibn al-Mutawakkil, to expel the Jews and demolish their synagogues on 1 Sha ªbƒÅn 1088 anno Hijri (= 29 September 1677), nearly two years before the actual expulsion. The matter was delayed only because the governor wished to consult first with the religious scholars of his city. All this may have been done without the foreknowledge of the Jewish community. See: van Koningsveld, et al. (1990), p. 23. They had been advised to sell their houses, fields and vineyards, and that all property which they were unable to sell would automatically be confiscated and accrue to the Public Treasury (Ar. al-mƒÅl), without recompense.Qafih (1958); Qafih (1989), vol. 2, p. 714 By late 1679, when the king saw that they were unrelenting in their fathers' faith, he then decided to follow through with what he had determined for them and issued a decree, banishing all Jews in his kingdom to the Red Sea outpost known as Zeila'. On the 2nd day of the lunar month Rajab, in the year 1090 of the Hijri calendar (corresponding with Gregorian calendar, 10 August 1679), his edict was put into effect, and he ordered the Jews of Sana'a to take leave of their places, but gave more space to the provincial governors of Yemen to begin the expulsion of all other Jews in Yemen to Zeila', and which should be accomplished by them in a time period not to exceed twelve months. The Jews of Sana'a had, meanwhile, set out on their journey, leaving behind them their homes and possessions, rather than exchange their religion for another. In doing so, they brought sanctity to God's name.In accordance with a teaching in Leviticus 22:31‚Äì32, and explained in the Responsa of Rabbi David ibn Zimra,vol. 2 (part 4), responsum no. 92 [1163], Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), p. 47 (Hebrew pagination ◊õ◊ì). Here, the author makes it clear that if Jews are collectively compelled by the Ismaelites to convert to Islam or else face punishment, they are to prefer punishment rather than exchange their religion for another, and, in so doing, they bring sanctity to God's name. Rabbi Suleiman al-NaqqƒÅsh, by his wisdom and care for his community, had preemptively made arrangements for the community's safety and upkeep by sending written notifications to the Jewish communities which lay along the route, requesting that they provide food and assistance to their poor Jewish brethren when they passed through their communities in the coming weeks or days. The king's soldiers were sent to escort the exiles unto their final destination, while the king himself had sent orders to the governors of the outlying districts and places where it was known that the Jewish exiles were to pass through while en route to Zeila', commanding them not to permit any Jew to remain in those cities when they reached them, but to send them on in their journey.Al-Naddaf (1928); Reprinted in Zechor le'Avraham, by Uziel al-Nadaf, (Part II) Jerusalem 1992 (Hebrew), pp. 4-5 Unexpected turn of events Jewish mother and daughter in Yemen, 1949 Meanwhile, while columns of men, women and children were advancing by foot southward with only bare essentials, along the road leading from Sana'a to Dhamar, Yarim, 'Ibb and Ta'izz, the chiefs of the indigenous Sabaean tribes who had been the patrons of the Jews came together once again and petitioned the king, al-Mahdi, this time requesting that the king rescind his order to expel all Jews unto the Red Sea outpost of Zeila', but to be content with their banishment to the Tihama coastal town of Mawza', a town about from Mocha, as the crow flies. The reason being for this urgent request was that, by taking into consideration their troubles in a barren wasteland, those that will remain of them will be more inclined to repent and to choose the way of Islam, in which case it will be easier to hoist them from that place and to bring them back unto their former places. The grandees reminded the king how they had been faithful in implementing his orders. At hearing this, the king agreed and sent orders to the effect that Jewish exiles should be conducted only to Mawza'. By the time the Jews of Sana'a reached Dhamar, they had already been joined by the Jewish villagers of SiƒÅn and Tan'am (located about eastward of Bayt al-·∏§ƒÅ·∏çir, southeast Sana'a), all of which places lie within Sana'a's periphery.Ratzaby (1961), p. 367, s.v. poem entitled: ◊ê◊ë◊ü ◊ê◊ú◊ê◊°◊ë◊ê◊ò ◊ê◊ë◊ì◊¢, lines 16‚Äì19 The Jews had sent fifteen letters to the king in al-GhirƒÅs, asking him to forgive them of whatever offense they may have made and to permit them to remain in their former settlements, yet none of these did he answer.Ratzaby (1961), p. 369, s.v. poem entitled: ◊ê◊ë◊ü ◊ê◊ú◊ê◊°◊ë◊ê◊ò ◊ê◊ë◊ì◊¢, lines 4‚Äì5 Evacuation of the Jews of DhurƒÅn Yemenite Jew blows the shofar, 1947 Around the beginning of September 1679, approximately one month after the Jews of Sana'a had set out for Mawza‚Äõ, Jews that hailed from DhurƒÅn ‚Äì a village situate about three days' walking distance southwest of Sana'a ‚Äì were also evacuated from their village. In a letter written in 1684 to the Jewish community of Hebron, only four years after the community's return to DhurƒÅn, the author describes the sufferings of the Jews who were forced to leave their homes and to go into Mawza‚Äõ.Ratzaby (1972), pp. 203-207 One important revelation that emerges from his account of these events is that the Jews of Yemen had tried to pacify the king's wrath by paying large sums of money to him, but which money the king refused to accept: The author goes on to explain how that, when they reached their destination, they wept bitterly, since many of them had perished as in a plague, and they were unable to bury them because of the excruciating heat. When some of their party had tried to escape at night, approximately seventy men, the next morning when the sun arose they were stricken down by the intense heat, and there they died. The author concludes by saying, \\"Now, this decree of exile was at the beginning of anno mundi 5440 (= 1679 CE), and the blessed God redeemed us at the [year's] end; the sign of which being: 'The punishment of your iniquity has ended ' (Lam. 4:22).\\" Here, the author makes a play on words; the Hebrew word for \\"ended\\" (Heb. ◊™◊ù) having the numerical value of 440, the same as the year when abbreviated without the millennium.Ratzaby (1972), p. 207 Mawza ª The Tihama Coastal Plain - 1931 Mawza ª is a town situated eleven-days' walking distance from Sana'a, and ca. from the port of Mocha, in the Tihama coastal plain. During their long trek there, the king's soldiers pressed them on. Many of the sick and elderly and children died along the way. Others would later succumb to the harsh weather conditions of that place. All, however, suffered from hunger and thirst. Eventually, the community of Sana'a was joined by other Jewish communities from across Yemen. In Mawza ª they remained for one full year, until 1680, when the king's non-Jewish subjects began to complain about their lack of farm implements which had been exclusively made by Jewish craftsmen.Qafi·∏• (1958), pp. 246‚Äì286; Qafih (1989), vol. 2, pp. 714‚Äì715 The governor of \`Amran went personally before the king with a petition to bring back his Jewish subjects. The king acquiesced and sent emissaries bearing food and water to call them back to their former cities.Sassoon (1931), p. 6 Some returned only to find their homes taken by usurping occupants. Others decided to move and to settle elsewhere in Yemen.Qafih (1989), vol. 2, p. 716 Rabbi Hayim Hibshush, speaking somewhat about this time, writes: \\"For the duration of one year since this decree was first issued, they went as sheep to the slaughter from all the districts of Yemen, while none remained of all those districts who did not go into exile, excepting the district of Nihm towards the east, and the district of al-Jawf, as well as the eastern district of Khawlan.\\" Historical records Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, 1904 Rabbi Yi·∏•yah Sala·∏• (who is known by the acronym Maharitz) gives a most captivating account of these harrowing events borne by the Jews of Sana'a in the years leading up to their expulsion, as also when they left their city, based on a hand-written document preserved and copied down by subsequent generations. Some have judged the sum and bearing of these events as a mere microscopic example of the sufferings experienced by the Jewish inhabitants as a whole, in each and every city throughout Yemen. Thus, he gives the following account:Tobi (1986), pp. 44-47 (based on MS. #1, Hebrew) Aftermath Jewish Children in the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a, 1901 Those Jews who survived, who returned either to Sana'a or to the other towns and villages, were mostly ill from being exposed to the changes in climate and from the poor quality of drinking water. In Sana'a, they were required to relinquish their ownership over their houses and fields within the city's wall, in the neighborhood of al-SƒÅ'ilah, and were directed to build humble abodes in a new area outside of the city's walls, in a place then known as the \\"hyena's field\\" (Ar. QƒÅ ª al- sima ª), or what later became known as QƒÅ ª al-Yahud (the Jewish Quarter).Qafih (1958), pp. 246-286; Qafih (1989), vol. 2, p. 706 This place attracted other migrant Jews from the other towns and villages from which they had been expelled and soon grew into a suburb, situate about one kilometer beyond the walls which then existed on the extreme west-side of the city. The first synagogue to be built in this place was the Alsheikh synagogue, which housed the most prized possessions: Torah scrolls and old, handwritten manuscripts.Qafih, 1982, p. 81, note 48. Jewish houses were made \\"low, seldom more than two storeys, and built of sun-baked brick dressed with mud.\\"Bury (1915), p. 80. Today, the place is called QƒÅ ª al- ªUlufi (Ar. ŸÇÿßÿπ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÅŸä).Serjeant & Lewcock (1983), p. 82; Playfair (1859), p. 112; Stillman (1979), p. 322. The lands upon which they built the new Jewish Quarter were lands provided by the king, but the Jews were later required to pay a monthly tenancy fee for the land, and which money accrued to the Muslim Waqf (mortmain land) for the upkeep of their own places of worship. Between the new Jewish Quarter and the city walls was a suburb full of gardens called Bi'r al ªAzab (the Single's Well), being once the Turkish Quarter.Qafih (1982), p. 80, note 44 In subsequent years, the Jewish Quarter was also enclosed by a wall.Tobi (1986), p. 77 At that time, the Muslims passed a new edict which forbade Jews from dwelling within Muslim neighborhoods, so as not to \\"defile their habitations,\\" although they were at liberty to work in the city.Qafih (1958); Qafih (1989) vol. 2, p. 706 Those who traversed between the Jewish Quarter and the city would go by foot, while those who were either aged or ill would make use of beasts of burden to carry them into the city, the Jewish Quarter being then at a distance of about one-kilometer from the city's walls. The king then passed a series of discriminatory laws (Ar. ghiyƒÅr) meant to humiliate the Jews and which not only forbade their riding upon donkeys and horses, but also from walking or passing to the right side of any Muslim. Jews were to pass only on the left side of all Muslims. They also petitioned the king that a Jew would be prohibited by an edict from raising his voice against any Muslim, but to behave in a lowly and contrite spirit, and that offenders would be made punishable by flogging.Qafih (1958); Qafih (1989), vol. 2, pp. 706-707 The Exile of Mawza ª brought about demographic changes that could be felt all across Yemen. In Sana'a, to distinguish the original inhabitants from incoming migrant Jews, all newcomers who chose to dwell in the newly built Jewish Quarter were given surnames, each one after the place from which he was exiled, so that a man who came from the district of Shar ªab was called so-and- so, al-Shar ªabi, or he that came from the village of Maswar was called so-and- so, al-Maswari. In the words of the Jewish chronicler who wrote Dofi Hazeman (Vicissitudes of Time), being one of the earliest Jewish accounts of the expulsion (initially compiled by Ya·∏•yƒÅ ben Judah ·π¢a'di in 1725) Goitein (1983), p. 162. David Solomon Sassoon attributes the writing to [the son of] Sa'ƒ´d, based on the author's own remark that he is \\"the son of ·∏§azmaq the younger\\" (= Sa'ƒ´d, or Se'adyah), the usual rendition for this name given in the reversed order of the Hebrew alphabet. See: Sassoon (1932), vol. 2, p. 969, s.v. ◊ì◊ï◊§◊ô ◊î◊ñ◊û◊ü. A microfilm copy of this work is available at the National Library of Israel in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103. and which work has since undergone several recensions by later chroniclers, we read the following testimony:Qafih (1958), pp. 246-286; Qafi·∏• (1989), vol. 2, p. 716 Danish explorer, Carsten Niebuhr, who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1763, some eighty-three years following the community's return to Sana'a, estimated their numbers at only two-thousand.Niebuhr (1992), pp. 416-418 These had built, up until 1761, fourteen synagogues within the new Jewish Quarter. In 1902, before the famine of 1905 decimated more than half of the city's Jewish population, German explorer Hermann Burchardt estimated the Jewish population of Sana'a at somewhere between six and eight thousand.Burchardt (1902), p. 338 G. Wyman Bury, who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1905 noted a decrease in the city's population from 1891, estimated at 50,000 people (Jews and Muslims alike), to only about 20,000 people in 1905. By 1934, when Carl Rathjens visited Sana'a, the Jewish population in the city had swollen to about seven thousand.Rathjens & v. Wissman (1934), vol. 40, pp. 133-134; 141. Three Jewish boys standing in the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a - circa 1938 Fate of the Old Synagogue One of the outcomes of the king's notorious decree was that Jewish property passed into Muslim hands. A Jewish public bath house in Sana'a was relinquished and passed into the proprietorship of the Muslim Waqf. So, too, the once famous synagogue within Sana'a's walled city and which was known as Kenisat al-'UlamƒÅ (The Synagogue of the Sages) was turned into a mosque and called Masjid al-JalƒÅ ‚Äì the Mosque of the Expulsion, or \\"of those banished.\\" On the frieze (Ar. ·π≠iraz) of the Masjid al-JalƒÅ were inscribed words with invectives, in gypsum plaster (Ar. al-ju·π£): > Our king, al-Mahdi, is the sun of [religious] guidance / even A·∏•mad, the > [grand]son of him who rose to power, al-Qasim.

Muhammad), in the year A.H. 1091 (= 1679 CE) in the synagogue of the Jewish Quarter, who banished them from Sana'a and removed them unto a place befitting them, [a place] now known as QƒÅ ª al-Yahud on the west side of Sana'a, just as it has been intimated by the scholarly judge, Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Su·∏•uli, etc.\\" Rabbi Amram Qorah then proceeds to bring down the words or panegyric inscribed on the frieze of the mosque in rhymed verse (see: supra), and which apparently had been composed by the said judge, in which he describes the exploits of the king who banished the Jews and who converted their synagogue into a mosque.Qorah (1954), pp. 10-11 (pp. 23-24 in PDF) [Hebrew] Rabbi Amram Qorah, in the same work, brings down Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen's account of events, whose testimony he found written in the margin of the first page of a Prayer Book (Siddur), written in 1710:Qorah (1988), pp. 9 -10. Moshe Gavra brings down the same account, mentioning that Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen of Dhamar had first written this account in a Siddur that he had written for Rabbi Yehudah ·π¢a'adi in 1680. See: Gavra (2010), vol. 1, p. 72 > Now I shall inform you, my brethren, about what has happened to us at this > time, since the beginning of anno 1,990 of the Seleucid Era (1678 CE) and in > 1,991 [of the same] (1679 CE), how that the king made a decree and > demolished all the synagogues of all the towns of Yemen, and there were some > of the books and sacred writings that were desecrated at the hand of the > gentiles, on account of our great iniquities, so that we could no longer > make our [public] prayers, save only a very few [men] secretly within their > houses.

Yet, the divine Name, > blessed be He, gives us strength to bear all those troubles and travails > each day. Testimonies preserved in poetry Another man who witnessed these events, Shalem 'Ashri, also wrote a suppliant poem about the events of that year ‚Äì the Exile of Mawza ª, now preserved in the Yemenite DiwƒÅn,Hasid (1976), p. 51, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ô◊ú ◊ì◊û◊¢◊ï◊™◊ô ◊õ◊û◊ò◊® ◊ô◊ñ◊ú◊ï which same poem is meant to be chanted as a slow dirge by one or, at the most, two individuals, who are then answered by others who sit in attendance. It is sung without the accompaniment of musical instruments, although a tin drum is sometimes used, in accordance with what is customary and proper for the nashid (a rejoinder). His own name is spelt out in acrostic form in the first letters of each stanza: \\"I shall shed my tears ‚Äì like rain they shall pour down / over all the pleasant sons who have gone forth into exile. They have forgotten what pertains to their happiness, and have also been diminished. / They journeyed in haste; along the parched ground they trod.

In the following poem of the subgenre known as qi·π£·π£a (poetic tale), composed mostly in Judeo-Arabic with only two stanzas written in Hebrew, the author gives a long testimony about the events which transpired during that year of exile. The poem is entitled, Wa·π£alnƒÅ hƒÅtif al-al·∏•ƒÅn ‚Äì \\"Tidings have reached us,\\" and is the work of the illustrious poet, Shalom Shabazi, who was an eye-witness to these events and whose name is inscribed in the poem in acrostics. The rhyme, however, has been lost in the translation:The English translation (in the collapsible thread) is based on the Hebrew translation of the poem made by Ratzaby (1961), pp. 353-354. \\"Tidings have reached us on the second day of [the lunar month] Rajab (i.e. corresponds with the 2nd day of the lunar month Elul), saying, 'My companions, arise and ascribe singularity unto the Merciful One, and read [the decree] that has been inscribed! Hearken to these matters, and let not your mind be distracted, for the appointed time is at hand. Al-Mahdi the king has decreed over us that we take flight.' The Jews of Sana'a then took leave, and have wandered unto those select places,Lit. \\"...have wandered unto Khabt,\\" perhaps being the Al-Khabt in the Abyan District, in the far south-eastern reaches of Yemen, near the Indian Ocean. Yehudah Ratzaby suggests that the sense here is to two towns, the one being called Khabt of Dar ªƒÅn and the other, Khabt of al-Baqr. Initially, the king had agreed that Jews be permitted to resettle in these towns, but later changed his mind. See: Ratzaby (1961), pp. 378-379, note *4. even unto the habitation of vipers and brute beasts. Even from al-Mahjam and from Dar'ƒÅn it was decreed over us to leave; by authorization of an edict which has overcome us. Now, we shall wait in Mawza'; there we shall dwell in the far reaches of the land belonging to the inhabitants of Arabia. All of the inhabitants of 'Uzal (i.e. ·π¢an'ƒÅ') were obedient, and they assembled in Dhamar. My companion, tighten the camel's gear and we'll begin moving after the ass. Let us proceed to 'Adinah, then to 'Amirah, and to al-'AmmƒÅr, while there we shall make camp. As for the young ones and those who were weak, their tears flowed like riverine brooks. 'Idaynah, receive those who are beloved! Go out to the gate of the city to welcome them! Now is the hour of testing those who are friends. Let them take pleasure in the weary fugitive, so that his fatigue might depart from him. Lo! They are the sons of the tribes and of those who are pious; those who are highborn and of gentility. ·π¢afƒ´ al-Din (i.e. al-Mahdi) has already given the order that we not remain in our places. Whether rich man or poor man, or he that is respectable, together they have gone forth; let us proceed according to our ability, under the influences of Saturn's horoscope; its evil portent will bring destruction. If its light flickers, it is about to change. The wisdom of the Blessed God has decreed upon the Sages of Israel, even the chosen sons of Jacob. Our elder, Suleiman [al-NaqqƒÅsh] the Helmsman, will be the judge of those attempting to bypass [his decree]. In his hand there is the ImƒÅm's order for all to see, while there is nothing disparaging about the matter. I am curtailed of my sleep from dismay, while tears run down my cheeks. When our elder, al-NaqqƒÅsh, had arrived, all of the Jews [who had come out to see him] were shaken-up. 'Let us go out into the barren wasteland, a place of monstrous beasts and every kind of lion. Happy is he who returns safely from that place. We have already sold our fields, have forsaken our houses, and have submitted to the decree of our lord, [the king].' The young men wept, as also the pious men, when His anger was turned against us. Consider, O Lord, and reflect upon how many distinguished men, as well as those who were delicately raised, have been humiliated! Weep, O Rachel, in our city for [your] wandering sons! Stir up our forefathers, let them arise, standing upon their feet, so that they may make mention of our fathers who, with grace, insist upon God's unison. May God's favour accompany us, in whose shadow we fervently desire. Let him gather those who dwell in Yemen, seeing that He is a Shepherd and the Faithful God. We shall then hear the song of the sons of Heman (i.e. the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah). Let him then take away the poison of the adder, which is most bitter. Let him command Yinnon (i.e. the Messiah) and the Prefect [of the priest] (i.e. Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah), and let him say to him: 'Draw nigh!' By the merit of our forefathers, by the favour [with which you have favoured] Levi who is of Jacob's seed, make level [the ground] along the route in your wilderness for the son who is, both, comely and good. And by the nut tree garden may you sedate my heart which is in pain. As for Gabriel and the rooster, I have heard them in the street, whilst my pigeon is at rest; she calls out to the poor: 'Release [them] from their bonds!' In Zion there is to be found relief, whilst our portion is in the Garden of Eden, just as a son who is dearly loved. We shall then behold the house of our God, and the houses of Gischala (Heb. Gush ·∏§alab). The MashtaiteAnother appellation for Shalom Shabazi has said: O God, remove mine affliction. Our strength is brought low in Yemen, in the days of my exile. In both small and great matters, I think about my case. Now, by the abundance [of afflictions] delights have been diminished. O gracious God! He who instructs my tongue to speak, Heaven forbid that you have forgotten me! Unto Whom belong signs and wonders. Behold, it was upon us that He bestowed His bounty, and He has chosen Moses, the son of Amram, our beloved prophet! The pampered pigeons are cooing in the tops of the citadels. The householders of al-SƒÅ'ilah who have come to visit al-Mahdi are complaining [before him] about how destruction and evil have come over them. They recall the conversations revolving around the Divine Law spoken [between their walls], and the vines and the flowers [in their gardens]; they recall also the social gatherings where wine was served, and the chalices, and the splendour of their wedding feasts, where [a man] would delight himself in them, become inebriated, but would avoid that which is obscene or mockery; [he'd drink] pure wine, whatever kind at hand, whose colour was as gold! The Book of the Law (i.e. Torah) calls out to all wise men, and says: 'Have you neglected the study of the Law? It is the reason for their ignorance. Let them repent before the masters and return unto their Lord. The day of redemption is nigh, and He shall gather together their dispersed. There is a time for drinking wine, together with [eating] dainties, and there is a time for delving in wisdom. He, whose wine makes him heavy laden, let him sleep [and rest] from his weariness and from his burden. Let him wake-up to drink a second cup, such as may be imposed upon him. In conclusion, [let us pray] that He who is congenial (i.e. God) might conceal us in the covert of His mercy. The Benevolent One shall not forget us, while we shall proclaim the eminence of His bountiful grace. He that will console us, may he be merited with a good life. He that gives to us clothing, may his own wishes be fulfilled. My salutations go out unto those of my companions on this happy, but powerful night; [which shall continue unabated] until Venus comes out [in the sky]. That which my God has decreed shall come to pass, while for every thing there is a reason. The birds will once again trill at the top of the ben [nut] tree (Moringa peregrina) in the fruitful orchard.\\" Another record of these events, composed here in poetic verse (although the rhyme has been lost in the translation), is the poem composed by SƒÅlim ben Sa'ƒ´d, in Judeo-Arabic. The poem is written as a nashid and is entitled, 'Ibda' birrub al-'arsh (I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne).Ratzaby (1961), pp. 379-380 (Translation of the original Judeo-Arabic), s.v. poem entitled: ◊ê◊ë◊ì◊¢ ◊ë◊®◊ë ◊ê◊ú◊¢◊®◊©; The original Judeo-Arabic was published in Hazofeh ‚Äì Quartalis Hebraica (ed. Dr. L. Blau), vol. 7, Budapest 1923; (ibid.) Second edition, Jerusalem 1972, pp. 2‚Äì3. The original Judeo-Arabic text can also be had at the Hebrew University National Library (Givat Ram Campus), Jerusalem, Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103. \\"I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne [of glory], even He that is an Omniscient God, the Creator of all creatures; He who causes the dumb to speak. I was curtailed of my sleep this night, while my heart was aching on account the king's decree; he that has made a decree against us by an oath. He has revealed his ill-intentions on a dark night, one made sullen by the shadow of death; and who has sent against us soldiers and oppressors. We lifted up our voices unto God of heaven, [saying]: 'Remove from us the evil of this decree. Behold! You are He that governs all!' They have destroyed all of the cities, and have cast their fear upon the Sages. There is none who takes an interest in our case, nor anyone who will take pity upon us. He lifted up his right hand and swore, 'They have no choice but to be banished unto Mawza!' He commanded to destroy the synagogues which were in Sana'a, the habitation of the Divine Law and the seating place of the Sages. He forced (?) them to go out into a parched land, the Tihama and al-Mahjam. They wandered unto Mawza' and walked along the paths, in the fierce blaze of heat and with severe thirst. On the day in which he took them out of their houses, their eyes rained tears of blood. They had gone out a short distance in the dark of night.In accordance with a verse in Ezekiel 12:4, And you shall go forth at eventide in their sight, as they that go forth into exile. Several distinguished persons, and several disciples of the Sages [went forth into exile]; they and their little ones, who were without understanding. 'You are obliged to go forth into exile; \`tis from the Lord of Heaven, who once delivered us from the hand of wicked Pharaoh.' My heart moans over my relatives who are missing. I have no pleasure in sleep, nor in bread or water! A flame burns inside of me, ever since the evil tidings [of the king's decree] reached me; I have become perplexed. Praised be the Creator of the heavenly circuits, the Ruler of all [things], unto whom none can be compared. Your covenant and your signs have been forever. You have intoxicated your people with the waters of Abraham, [made during] the covenant between the dissected halves.An allusion to Genesis 15:1-21. But now, O king of most puissant kings, your people are sadly distressed and are deprived of all things. They (i.e. the gentiles) cast their fear upon us, while the horsemen inflict us. No one tries to help us, nor is there anyone who takes pity upon us. They have humiliated our religion, and have called out to us to become Muslims; even to sin and to desecrate your Divine Law. He (i.e. the ImƒÅm) has issued against us frequent declarations; shall we not fear the punishment of God on High? Our elders have gone forth into exile by an urgent command, whether willingly or unwillingly. I have concluded my words, my brethren! Take-up my salutations and remain silent! Our hope is in God the Omniscient. Remember me, O God, on account of the Divine Law's hidden mystery! So, too, remember Jacob, 'the man of pure intentions' [dwelling in tents]!An allusion to Genesis 25:27. Remember Moses who built for you the Tent of Convocation in the Sinai wilderness, on the day in which your Divine Presence dwelt thereon. Do not forget Isaac, your bound [servant], on the day in which he spoke to Abraham face to face. Praise be to you, O Master of the universe! \`Tis from me, SƒÅlim ben Sa'ƒ´d, who has written rhymed verse.\\" Jacob Saphir's Testimony In 1859, Lithuanian Jew, Jacob Saphir, visited the Jewish community in Yemen, less than two-hundred years after the Exile of Mawza', but still heard vivid accounts from the people about the things that befell their ancestors during that fateful event. Later, he made a written account of the same in his momentous ethnographic work, Iben Safir.Saphir (1866), vol. 1, pp. 100a-100b The full, unabridged account is given here (translated from the original Hebrew): \\"[The Jews] dwelt securely, beneath the shadow of the kings of that country, until three-hundred (sic) years agoShould be amended to read \\"approximately two-hundred years ago,\\" i.e. 1679 while they were dwelling in that chief metropolis, when the daughter of the king became pregnant outside of wedlock, and they laid the blame upon a Jewish man, one of the king's courtiers and of those who behold his countenance. However, the king's wrath wasn't assuaged until he had banished all of the Jews from that city and the surrounding regions, expelling them to the region of Tihama, a desolate wilderness (a walking distance of ten days' journey in a south-westerly direction from Sana'a), between Mocha and Aden; a salty land, and one of very fearsome heat, while they were all tender and accustomed to delicacies. Many of them died along the way, while those who came there could not bear the climate of that place and its infirmities. Two thirds of them succumbed and perished, and they had entertained the notion that all of them would perish either by the plague, by famine or by thirst, may God forbid. (Here, J. Saphir brings down a poem written about the event by Rabbi Shalom Shabazi, and which has already been quoted above) Now during the time of this exile and perdition, they had lost all of their precious belongings, and their handwritten books, as well as their peculiar compositions which they possessed of old. I have also seen their synagogues and places of study used by them of old in the city of the gentiles; eternal desolations 'and where demons will be found making sport' (Isa. 13:21), on account of our great iniquities. Notwithstanding, it is by the mercies of the Lord that we have not perished. He (i.e. God) did not prolong the days of their exile, but sent great distempers upon the king and upon his household. (They say that this was on account of the virtue of that pious Rabbi, the kabbalist, even our teacher and Rabbi, Mori SƒÅlim al-Shabazi, may the memory of the righteous be blessed, who brought about multiple forms of distempers upon that cruel king, who then regretted the evil [that he caused them] and sent [messengers] to call out unto them [with] a conciliatory message, [requesting] that they return to their place ‚Äì with the one exception that they not dwell with them in the royal city built as a fortress. He then gave to them a possession, being a grand inheritance outside of the city, which is al-Qa ªa, B'ir al- ªAzƒÅb ‚Äì the plain wherein is the cistern known as  ªAzƒÅb, and they built there houses for their dwelling quarters and built for themselves an enclosing wall which extended as far as to the wall of the city built like unto a fortress. In only a short time God assisted them, and they built there a large city and one that was spacious. They also acquired wealth and they rose to prominence, while many of the villagers likewise seized [upon land] with them, that they might dwell in the city, until it became [a place] full of people. At that time, Mori Yi·∏•ya Halevi was the Nasi among them and the Exilarch.)\\"  References to Sana'a before the expulsion There are several references to Jewish life in Sana'a before the expulsion of 1679. Maharitz (d. 1805) mentions in his ResponsaSaleh (1979), vol. 3, responsum # 252 (p. 153) that before the Exile of Mawza the Jews of Sana'a had an old custom to say the seven benedictions for the bridegroom and bride on a Friday morning, following the couple's wedding the day before. On Friday (Sabbath eve) they would pitch a large tent within a garden called al-Jowzah, replete with pillows and cushions, and there, on the next day (Sabbath afternoon), the invited guests would repeat the seven benedictions for the bridegroom and bride, followed by prayer inside the tent, before being dismissed to eat of their third Sabbath meal, at which time some accompanied the bridegroom to his own house to eat with him there. The significance of this practice, according to Maharitz, was that they made the seven blessings even when not actually eating in that place, a practice which differs from today's custom. German-Jewish ethnographer, Shelomo Dov Goitein, mentions a historical note about the old synagogue in Sana'a, before the expulsion of Jews from the city in 1679, and which is written in the glosses of an old copy of the Mishnah (Seder Moed), written with Babylonian supralinear punctuation.Levi Nahum (1975), Introduction, p. 18 The marginal note concerns the accurate pronunciation of the word ◊ê◊ô◊©◊ï◊™ in Mishnah Mo'ed ·∏≤a·π≠an 1:4, and reads as follows: \\"Now the Jews of Sana'a read it as ◊ê÷¥◊ô◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊™ (ish≈´th), with a [vowel] shuraq (shuruk). I studied with them a long time ago, during the time when the synagogue of Sana'a was still standing in situ.\\" Enactments in wake of exile (1680‚Äì1690) Upon returning to Sana'a, the Chief Rabbis, led by R. Shelomo Manzeli and Yi·∏•ya Halevi (called Alsheikh), came together in the newly built Alsheikh synagogue and decided to put in place a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the community, and which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such harsh decrees against the Jewish community in the future.Gavra (2010), vol. 1, pp. 70‚Äì71; ibid. vol. 4, pp. 156‚Äì159 These enactments were transcribed in a document entitled Iggereth Ha-Besoroth (Letter of Tidings), and which was believed to have been disseminated amongst the community at large. Only excerpts of the letter have survived.Subeiri (1976‚Äì1992), vol. 3, p. 297; Saleh (1979), vol. 3, responsum # 252 (p. 153). The enactments called out for a more strict observance of certain laws which, heretofore, had been observed with leniency. Such strictures were to be incumbent upon the entire community and which, in the Rabbis' estimation, would have given to the community some merit in the face of oppression or persecution. Not all of these enactments, however, were upheld by the community, since some enactments were seen as breaking-away from tradition.One of the enactments called out for making one-hundred blasts of the horn on the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), based on a teaching found in Rabbi Nathan ben Jehiel's Sefer Ha-Arukh, s.v. ◊¢◊®◊ë, instead of the traditional forty blasts which had been observed earlier. Another enactment sought to make it a standard procedure during the Mussaf-prayer of Rosh Hashanah to make two prayers: the first, by the congregation praying silently, followed by a repetition of the prayer said aloud by the Shaliach Tzibbur (Prayer precentor). Maharitz would later adamantly oppose the enactment, since it sought to cancel the ancient tradition in Yemen in this regard in which it had always been a practice to make only one Mussaf-prayer. Another enactment concerned the seven benedictions mentioned by Rabbi Yosef Karo in his Shul·∏•an Arukh (Even Ha ªezer 62:10), where he brings down a certain opinion which states that is not permissible for the groom and bride to be entertained in another person's house other than in his own house during the seven days of wedding festivities, unless he and his bride were to leave their own house or town for an extended period of time, in which case it is then permissible. The enactment is mentioned with regard to Iggereth Ha-Besoroth in Saleh (1979), vol. 3, responsum # 252, although the enactment seemed to have been rejected by Maharitz, in favour of Israel's older practice in Yemen. Rabbi Shalom Yitzhaq Halevi informs us that the Yemenite custom in his day was as that taught by Maharitz, and rectifies the discrepancy between the Shul·∏•an Arukh and the Yemenite Jewish custom by writing in the glosses of his 1894 edition of the TiklƒÅl Etz ·∏§ayim that the Shul·∏•an Arukh (ibid.) refers merely to when the groom and bride are invited to make the \\"seven benedictions\\" in another house where, during the seven days of feasting, a supper had been made on behalf of a circumcision, or some other ceremonial meal other than what was specifically made on the groom's behalf, in which it is not permitted to say for them the \\"seven benedictions.\\" See also Rabbi ·∏§ayim Kessar's Questions & Responsa Ha·∏•ayim wehashalom (Even Ha ªezer, responsum # 10), who cites from Rabbi Yihya Hacohen's Responsa, ·∏§ayei Shalom (responsum # 2), where he says that after the wedding, it was never a custom in Yemen that a man's bride accompanied him when he was invited to eat in the home of others. He reasons that, since she is not with him, they should not say the seven benedictions for the bridegroom alone.

Background Intelligence gathering involves a range of specialized approaches - from Signals intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), to Open-source intelligence (OSINT). In many cases, information collected from human sources is still considered highly reliable by intelligence analysts, especially while transforming a collection of disparate data strands into an actionable prevention plan. Mark Lowenthal, a leading intelligence thinker, argues that traditional HUMINT is still considered a crucial element in intelligence, that can significantly tilt the balance of power. CyberHumint methodology was first coined by Ed Alcantara AFX DBI in Feb 2010. Amit Steinhart argued that the cooperation between skilled HUMINT experts trained with specific HUMINT capabilities, and computer security specialists, who apply \\"social engineering\\" techniques, is one of the main advantages of CyberHumint. Steinhart offered a new model of information security strategy that imports concepts from HUMINT espionage, and combines it with social engineering strategies, such as the usage of avatars for agents operating in cyberspace, or information and disinformation spreading through cyberspace. HUMINT experts often argue that in comparison to the relatively young social engineering concept, HUMINT practices, which had been developed for many years by professionals working at national intelligence services, hold the higher ground in terms of experience, technologies, and practices. New form of cyber capability was created when the technical capabilities of computer experts were combined with the intelligence experienceUK Intelligence Has Endorsed Cyber Security Courses For Wannabe Spies of HUMINT experts. CyberHumint strategy orientation CyberHumint is aimed to effectively defend organizations against APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks. In the beginning of the 2010s, organizations such as the American NSA and British GCHQ have started to invest significant resources into acquiring technological and intelligence capabilities, to help identify cyber aggressors and assess their abilities and tactical skills. Recently, information security has shifted from building firewalls to build systems, in order to provide real- time intelligence. Most near-future scenarios suggest that organizations who fail to adapt to the systematic cyber approach will find themselves in a critical situation. In 2011, Andress and Winterfeld drew the attention to the fact that while cyber security experts can deliver extensive reports on Internet risks, most of the alerts are still general, unspecific and do not actually meet the expectations of the specific organization. In addition, cyber security companies locate hackers or cyber attackers only when the attack is already in progress or worse - after a given system has already been damaged or compromised. The majority of cyber security defenders currently use automatic network scans as a routine measure. A human analyst becomes involved only at the final stage of data-gathering, which means the bulk of the available data will not be analyzed in real time. Hackers and CyberHumint The majority of cyber security companies has no access to human operators within the Dark Web. Hence, they do not benefit from the key input of informants and agents provocateurs. These companies do not apply the methods of agent recruitment and agent management, which various national intelligence organizations have developed and used effectively for years. New information technologies allow hackers to acquire the upper hand in any confrontation with the targeted organization. A case in point is APT √± Advanced persistent threat, which in impact and devastation equals to a military strike against a civilian entity. Many peripheral defense systems are not capable of recognizing indications of incoming attacks in advance, and cannot intercept the attack during its course. The majority of security systems can only acknowledge the attack after the damage has already occurred. Most organizations prefer to focus their security efforts on inward-facing protection strategies, in an attempt to prevent attackers from entering the organization's network. Their defense protocols are not designed to protect from attempts to exploit the organization's employees, who have become the main target for willful intelligence gathering. Personal behavior, compromising private situations, work habits, passwords and other private and business information can be easily harvested and used to facilitate an attack against the organization. The interface between Cyber Experts and CyberHumint The concept of CyberHumint allows cyber expertsCyberspace Is Not a Warfighting Domain, by Martin C. Libicki and human intelligence specialists to use real-life human sources, both in the gt and within many public or secret online social networks and operating systems. By investigating authentic human sources, intelligence experts and cyber experts can explore the various possible aims of potential attackers and their abilities, by monitoring their electronic activities. Outcomes usually leave much to be desired. Attackers are only identified after the attack has started. In just a handful of cases did companies manage to alert their clients against a pending attack. CyberHumint involves recruiting human agents and deploying them with strategic efficiency to provide the organization with a clear, focused picture of likely threats and hostile actors with the intention of harming the organization. CyberHumint uses classic HUMINT tactics that had been practiced for more than half a century by the national intelligence agencies. It combines them with hackers' social engineering concepts. Using CyberHumint requires qualified computer professionals who are well-versed in the behavior patterns, linguistic nuances and conventions accepted within the Darknet, as well as other online networks and subcultures. Conversant computer experts and intelligence specialists work in synchrony to uncover indications of intent, long before it develops into an attack plan, so organizations can decide how, where, and when to expose or incapacitate the potential attackers.

A 6-1 majority of the Court (Justice Michael Kirby dissenting) held that even if the conditions of immigration detention are harsh, such conditions do not render the detention unlawful. Background =Facts= Maharani Behrooz, an Iranian national, was being held in the Woomera Detention Centre pending determination of his application for refugee status. In November 2001, Behrooz was one of six men that escaped the detention centre. Following his capture, he was charged with escaping detention along with two of the other men. Their defence at the criminal trial was that conditions at the centre were so harsh that they were punitive, thus making the detention unlawful and the escape lawful. (2004) 8(1) University of Western Sydney Law Review 154. =Prior actions= To support the claim that the detention was harsh and therefore unlawful, the defendants applied for summonses to be issued to obtain a large amount of documentary material that would evidence the conditions at the centre. In January 2002, the Port Augusta Magistrates Court issued summonses to produce documents to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd and Australasian Correctional Services Pty Ltd, the two companies responsible for running the detention centre. The Department and the companies applied to the Magistrates Court for the summonses to be set aside. The Commonwealth Attorney-General intervened in the application and argued that producing all of the material sought was \\"oppresive\\", and that the summons was an abuse of process as the documents sought could not help establish a defence to the charge of escape. The magistrate rejected the Attorney-General's argument and refused to set aside the summonses, but narrowed their scope to the period in which at least one of the defendants was detained at the centre. The Department appealed to the Supreme Court where Gray J upheld the appeal on the grounds that \\"7. ... The defendants' complaint raises allegations about the conditions of their lawful detention. Those complaints cannot as a matter of law make the detention unlawful. The defendants do not seek relevant material\\". The summonses were therefore set aside.. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia (Lander and Besanko JJ, Bleby J dissenting), refused leave to appeal.. By the time the case was heard by the High Court, 2 of the 3 defendants had been deported and charges against the third were dropped. Judgment The High Court held, by a 6:1 majority, that even if Mr Behrooz could show that the conditions of his detention were harsh, he had no right to escape from Woomera. The information from the documents may assist Mr Behrooz to seek legal redress for any wrongs against him however that did not assist with the criminal charges pending against him. The summonses lacked a legitimate forensic purpose and were therefore properly set aside by the Supreme Court. Aftermath In July 2004, Mr Behrooz was released into a community detention arrangement to minimise the risk of suicide that would arise if he returned to a detention centre. He subsequently pleaded guilty to escaping from immigration detention. The magistrate discharged him without conviction upon Mr Behrooz entering into a good behaviour bond for 2 years in the sum of $100. The Crown appealed against the sentence. Gray J held that the magistrate had erred in the process of sentencing Mr Behrooz, however in re-sentencing Mr Behrooz found that the sentence was appropriate.. In February 2012 Mr Behrooz commenced proceedings in NSW seeking damages for the psychological harm he claims to have suffered as a result of his detention and those proceedings had not been resolved by April 2015..

(2004). Between Miracle and Sickness: Louise Lateau and the Experience of Stigmata and Ecstasy. Configurations 12: 77-105. The case of Louise Lateau is one of the best documented of those who received the stigmata. She was famous in the 1860s because of her mystical trances and between 1868 and 1883 she was observed by many physicians, members of the clergy and visitors.  Early life  Historian David Blackbourn has pointed out that a number of features in Lateau's life are similar to that of other mystics such as Anna Katharina Emmerick and to the experiences of visionaries such as Bernadette Soubirous and Catherine Labour√©. All suffered from harsh treatment, early separation from family or the loss of family members, and a life of dependency and poverty. Lateau‚Äôs father died of smallpox ten weeks after her birth. Louise also contracted the disease and was saved with much difficulty.Louise Lateau. Rapport m√©dical sur la stigmatis√©e de Bois d‚ÄôHaine, fait √† l‚ÄôAcad√©mie royale de m√©decine de Belgique au nom d‚Äôune commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Bailli√®re et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 10 At age 11, Lateau's mother put her out to work as a housemaid. Shortly thereafter, Lateau was brought back by her mother and had to work as a dressmaker. During a cholera epidemic in Bois-D‚ÄôHaine in 1866, Lateau, then 16, nursed six of the epidemic victims. The following year, she became seriously ill herself; the disease lasted until 1868. On 15 April 1868, she was so ill that she received the last rites. Ten days later, she had her first experience of the stigmata.Blackbourne , p. 41 The stigmata Beginning 24 April 1868, pain recurred every Friday and blood began to flow from her left side and feet.Louise Lateau. Rapport m√©dical sur la stigmatis√©e de Bois d‚ÄôHaine, fait √† l‚ÄôAcad√©mie royale de m√©decine de Belgique au nom d‚Äôune commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Bailli√®re et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 15 On 8 May, blood came from both hands as if from nail wounds. On 25 September, the stigmata was completed by the appearance on the breast of four small spots of blood as if coming from four pinpricks to the heart.Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatis√©e de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palm√©, 1873, page 22. The wounds appeared without apparent cause on the night of Thursday to Friday and disappeared the next night. They occurred every Friday until her death in 1883; for the rest of the week, Lateau continued to work for her family.Pierre Guelff, Curieuse histoire d'une stigmatis√©e, Jourdan, 2011 Lateau's claims of stigmata were disputed by Donovan Rawcliffe, who suggested they were self-inflicted, caused by \\"extreme emotional or other psychogenic factors following intense concentration on the crucifixion.\\"Rawcliffe, Donovan. (1988). Occult and Supernatural Phenomena. Dover Publications. p. 245. Ecstasies On 17 July 1868, the phenomenon of the bleeding of the stigmata was accompanied by an ecstasy, which returned every Friday in the form of a trance-like state that lasted for a total of 8 hours. The first ecstasy took place at 6:00 AM, after the distribution of Communion. A second occurred around 2:00 PM.‚Üë Louise Lateau. Rapport m√©dical sur la stigmatis√©e de Bois d‚ÄôHaine, fait √† l‚ÄôAcad√©mie royale de m√©decine de Belgique au nom d‚Äôune commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Bailli√®re et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 25 During the ecstasy, Lateau would stay in contemplation for hours. While she didn't seem to perceive what was going on around her, she would change position and move around the room. Her face usually expressed joy but also the fear and sadness of the Passion of Christ. The ecstasy ended after the mime of the Crucifixion and the Agony of Christ held in the parish church.Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatis√©e de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palm√©, 1873 She was insensitive to pain and noises, but could briefly exit the ecstasy following a request of the parish priest of Bois-d'Haine or some clergymen. Lateau claimed to see visions of the passion of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and saints.Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatis√©e de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palm√©, 1873 Lateau continued to live with her mother and sisters and worked for her family. These phenomena, however, began to attract attention, particularly beginning in 1871. It was alleged that Lateau could abstain from food. However, this claim was investigated and proven false (see below).Evans, Bergen. (1955). The Spoor of Spooks: And Other Nonsense. Purnell. p. 93 Ecclesiastical and scientific enquiries At the end of 1868, the Bishop of Tournai, Gaspar-Joseph Labis, opened a canonical investigation into Lateau. The commission was made up of clerics; a layperson, who was Minister of State Adolphe Dechamps; and a physician, Dr. Lefebvre of the Catholic University of Louvain. The investigation acknowledged Lateau's sincerity and the authenticity of the facts and concluded that science could find no rational explanation as to what had happened to her.Antoine Imbert- Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatis√©e de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palm√©, 1873, page 21. In 1874, the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium opened an investigation.Louise Lateau. Rapport m√©dical sur la stigmatis√©e de Bois d‚ÄôHaine, fait √† l‚ÄôAcad√©mie royale de m√©decine de Belgique au nom d‚Äôune commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Bailli√®re et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. For five months, Lateau was observed by experts appointed by the Academy. The conclusions of the investigation were published in 1875. Their conclusion was that there was no conscious deception in the stigmata and the ecstasies. Physician Evariste Warlomont suggested attributing the phenomena to \\"double consciousness\\" (later termed dissociative identity disorder).Hacking, Ian. (1995). Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory. Princeton University Press. p. 166. James, Tony. (2005). Dream, Creativity, and Madness in Nineteenth-Century France. Oxford University Press. pp. 237-238. French neurologist D√©sir√©-Magloire Bourneville argued that all of Lateau's phenomena were symptoms of hysteria.Hustvedt, Asti. (2011). Medical Muses: Hysteria in Nineteenth-Century Paris. Bloomsbury. p. 279. German psychiatrist Albert Moll suggested that a \\"natural explanation of the facts is possible, because such things can be induced by suggestion in a suitable mental state. The conditions resemble each other; the ecstasy of Lateau has a great likeness to the hypnotic state. Ecstasy and hypnosis have many points in common.\\"Moll, Albert. (1891). Hypnotism. London: Walter Scott. p. 117 The abstention from food and the cessation of sleep were not medically attested by the commission. The latter had not been possible as they were unable to carry out permanent monitoring in the family home. Experts from the commission advocated an observation of several days in a hospital, but this was not done.Louise Lateau. Rapport m√©dical sur la stigmatis√©e de Bois d‚ÄôHaine, fait √† l‚ÄôAcad√©mie royale de m√©decine de Belgique au nom d‚Äôune commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J.

According to skeptic Bergen Evans, \\"Dr Warlomont, an uncouth and discourteous fellow who was sent to investigate her claims by the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, unexpectedly wrenching upon a cupboard in her room, found a cache of food, and got Miss Lateau to admit that, while she never slept, she was subject to nocturnal periods of forgetfulness.\\"  Death  Lateau died on August 25, 1883. On 5 March 2009, the Vatican gave a negative answer to an enquiry wishing to further the cause for her possible beatification.Pierre Guelff, Curieuse histoire d'une stigmatis√©e, Jourdan 2011. p144-145  Further reading  *Blackbourn, David.

Biography Born in Cornwall on 18 July 1839, James Surtees Phillpotts was a grandson of Henry Phillpotts, the well known polemicist and Anglican Bishop of Exeter. William Phillpotts, his father, was Archdeacon of Cornwall and vicar of St Gluvias church, Penryn. His mother Louisa Buller was the sister of James Wentworth Buller M.P. and an aunt of General Sir Redvers Henry Buller.The Times, 17 October 1930 James Phillpotts was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where, in accordance with the provisions that existed at that time, he was elected a Fellow on going up in 1858.ibid. He won the Stanhope Prize in 1859. He passed his Honour Moderations (Mods) in Classics in 1860 and his Literae Humaniores (Greats) in 1862, achieving a first class in both and thus completing his B.A. degree. Thereupon he immediately proceeded to the B.C.L. degree.ibid. While at Oxford he won the mile race in the University Sports.Bedfordshire Times & Independent, 17 October 1930 In the summer of 1863, with his friends Robertson and Chaytor, he ascended the Jungfrau peak in Switzerland, a notable feat at the time.Letter, 23 July (1863), J.S. Phillpotts to his mother Louisa Phillpotts; in family possession.Letter, Sunday 26 July (1863), J.S. Phillpotts to Alexander Potts (later headmaster of Fettes College); in family possession. On leaving university he joined the staff of Rugby School where, from 1862 to 1874, he was an Assistant Master under the headmastership of Frederick Temple. In 1875, he was appointed Headmaster of Bedford School. During his period in office he undertook major reform of the school. He retired in 1903. For the remainder of his life he lived at The Ousels, Tunbridge Wells. During his retirement he served as a member of the Education Committee of Bedfordshire County Council. He died in Tunbridge Wells on 16 October 1930. In its obituary The Times described him as \\"one of the great headmasters of the last century\\".The Times, 20 October 1930 Headmastership of Bedford School When James Surtees Phillpotts took over as headmaster Bedford Grammar School (as it then was) had an indifferent record as an educational institution. There were about 250 boys on roll, most of them day students. With Rugby School as his model, Phillpotts set about reforming the school in every way. One of his first acts was to introduce the Natural Sciences into the curriculum. He saw to the establishment of chemistry and physics laboratories, and went on to add carpentry and engineering workshops, a gymnasium and five courts. Under his leadership sports were properly organized and used as a tool to foster team spirit. In all the changes he introduced Phillpotts' underlying aim was to produce upright, public spirited citizens well equipped for the challenges of the rapidly changing world in which they lived. As a result of the various developments initiated by James Surtees Phillpotts the school ran out of space in its original town centre location. Foreseeing the need to move to more spacious premises Phillpotts secured suitable land on his own initiative. In due course the school trustees backed his plan for new buildings on the new site and arranged the necessary finance. In 1891 the official opening of the new school took place, with a ceremonial procession from the old premises to the new.Graphic, 31 October 1891. The roll of pupils was then around 600, and by 1903 when Phillpotts retired it had risen to nearly 900.Bedfordshire Times & Independent, 17 October 1930. The development of Bedford Grammar School from an obscure provincial institution to one of England's leading public schools had a significant effect on the economy and size of Bedford town.Evening News, 16 October 1930. Family In 1868, while working at Rugby School, James Surtees Phillpotts married Marian Hadfield Cordery, daughter of John Cordery of Weatherall House, Hampstead. She was a sister of Henrietta, wife of Phillpotts' then colleague at Rugby, T.W. Jex-Blake. The couple had seven children, the eldest of whom died in early infancy. Among the remaining six the most notable was Dame Bertha Surtees Phillpotts, the Icelandic scholar.

Personality A frank caricature of J.S. Phillpotts' charismatic personality is contained in an article by a former pupil of his which was published in The Pioneer (an Indian journal) in 1903 and was quoted many years later in a Bedford newspaper.Bedfordshire Times & Independent & Bedfordshire Standard, 26 January 1945. > \\"He had a pale and thoughtful face, deep sunken candid eyes, bushy eyebrows, > and a full flowing beard. His head was small, but well-shaped; his forehead > broad and prominent, but not high.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1974 until July 1976 she won seven of her seventeen races and was placed on four occasions. As a two- year-old in 1974 she won four races including the Cherry Hinton Stakes and the Princess Margaret Stakes. In the following year, she showed her best form in summer, winning the Coronation Stakes and the Nassau Stakes. In 1976 she ran only three times, but became the first filly to win the Nassau Stakes for a second time. She was then retired from racing and became a very successful broodmare. Background Roussalka was a \\"strong, robust\\" mare with a white star and snip and white socks on her hind legs bred by the Newmarket-based Dalham Hall Stud. Although she was bred in the United Kingdom, her immediate antecedents were all bred in the United States. She was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Flying Water, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Roussalka was first foal of the American- bred mare Oh So Fair who went on to produce Our Home (winner of the Child Stakes and runner-up in the 1000 Guineas), Etienne Gerard (Jersey Stakes) and the Fillies' Triple Crown winner Oh So Sharp. As a yearling, Roussalka was offered for sale and bought for 21,000 guineas by Nicky Phillips, the owner of the Someries Stud. The filly was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Marriott House stable in Newmarket. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Roussalka won a maiden race over five furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse in May. On her next appearance in the Errol Stakes over the same distance at Ascot Racecourse in June she looked outpaced in the early stages but stayed on strongly to finish second, beaten a neck by the colt Raffindale. In July, the filly was moved up in class and distance to contest the Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in which she was ridden by Lester Piggott and started at odds of 2/1. She took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and went clear of her rivals, despite hanging left in the closing stages and won by four lengths from Mirthful Flirt. Over the same distance at Ascot in July she started the 4/9 favourite for the Princess Margaret Stakes. She showed impressive acceleration to take the lead approaching the final furlong and won by three length from Star of Bagdad giving Lester Piggott his 3,000th flat race win. Roussalka was less impressive when winning the Burmah Castrol Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse on 31 August, prevailing by only a neck from Honey Pot. Henry Cecil reportedly said the filly had been unsuited by the slow early pace which led to the race developing into a two furlong sprint. At Newmarket in October, Roussalka contested a very strong renewal of the Cheveley Park Stakes in which she finished fourth behind Cry of Truth, Delmora and Rose Bowl staying on in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win. =1975: three-year-old season= Roussalka took a long time to reach full fitness as a three-year-old and did not contest either the 1000 Guineas or the Oaks Stakes after running poorly in trial races: she was unplaced behind Rose Bowl in Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket in April and unplaced again when moved up in distance for the Musidora Stakes at York Racecourse in May, finishing unplaced behind Moonlight Night, May Hill and Tender Camilla. At Royal Ascot in June, the filly was dropped back in distance to contest the Coronation Stakes over one mile. Starting at odds of 9/1 she returned to her best form, drawing clear of her rivals in the straight to win by four lengths from Tender Camilla with Highest Trump in third place. In the Child Stakes at Newmarket in July, Roussalka was beaten three-quarters of a length by Saucboat, to whom she was conceding four pounds. Piggott appeared to ride a poorly-judged race on this occasion, holding up Roussalka at the back of the field and giving her too much ground to make up in the closing stages. Roussalka met Sauceboat again in the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse at the end of the month. Starting at odds of 9/4 she was restrained by Piggott until well inside the final furlong when she overtook Sauceboat and won very easily by a length. Timeform reported that Piggott on Roussalka had \\"played cat and mouse\\" with Sauceboat in the closing stages. In August, the filly ran under a four-pound weight penalty in the Waterford Crystal Mile. Racing on softer ground than she had previously encountered she finished third behind Gay Fandango and Rose Bowl. In September, Roussalka was matched against the four-year-old Record Run, winner of the Prince of Wales's Stakes, in the Royal Palace Stakes over ten furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. She finished second, after challenging the older horse in the straight before being eased by Piggott in the closing stages. On her final appearance of the season, she ran poorly when unplaced in the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket in October. =1976: four-year-old season= Roussalka remained in training as a four-year-old but made only three appearances. After finishing fifth on her debut she showed some promise when running fourth behind Duboff in the Child Stakes. At Goodwood in July he attempted to become the first horse to record successive victories in the Nassau Stakes. Ridden as usual by Piggott she started at odds of 15/8 against a field which included Sauceboat, to whom she was conceding three pounds. Roussalka looked beaten when she dropped to seventh place approaching the straight, but under a strong ride from Piggott, she produce a sustained run in the last quarter mile to overhaul Sauceboat in the final strides. Her feat of winning the race twice was subsequently matched by Ruby Tiger in 1991 and 1992 and superseded by Midday, who won the race three times in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year- olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Roussalka was allotted a weight of 116 pounds, making her the fourth-best two-year-old filly to race in the United Kingdom behind Cry of Truth, Rose Bowl and One Over Parr. The independent Timeorm organisation gave her a rating of 116, thirteen pounds inferior to Cry of Truth and fifteen behind the French-trained filly Broadway Dancer. In 1975, Roussalka was rated 123 by Timeform, ten pounds below their top-rated three- year-old filly Rose Bowl. In the official British Handicap for three-year-old she was assigned a weight of 123 pounds, eight pounds behind the leading fillies Rose Bowl and May Hill. In 1976 she was again rated 123 by Timeform, whilst the official British Handicapper rated her fifteen pounds inferior to the leading older female Rose Bowl. Breeding record Roussalka was retired from racing and became a very successful broodmare, producing fourteen foals, including several good winners between 1978 and 1995, She was also the female- line ancestor of the 1000 Guineas winner Ameerat and the leading international middle-distance performer Collier Hill. *Northern Supremo (chestnut colt, foaled in 1978, sired by Northern Dancer) failed to win in six races, disqualified after finishing first in a race at Newbury *Lost Splendour (filly, 1979, by Vaguely Noble) *Summer Impressions (chestnut filly, 1980, by Lyphard) failed to win in five races grand-dam of Ameerat *Staritsa (bay filly, 1981, by Alleged) *Borjom (chestnut colt, 1982, by Irish River) *Gayane (bay filly, 1984, by Nureyev) won four races including the Sirenia Stakes, runner-up in the July Cup *High Altar (bay colt, 1985, by High Line) won one race *Rain Date (chestnut filly, 1987, by Rainbow Quest), grand-dam of Collier Hill *Ristna (chestnut filly, 1988, by Kris) won four races including the Sun Chariot Stakes *Irek (bay gelding, 1989, by Shareef Dancer) won two races *Princely Gait (bay gelding, 1991, by Darshaan) won four races *Shahid (bay colt, 1992, by Green Deert) won five races including the Beeswing Stakes *Conspiracy (bay filly, 1994, by Rudimentary), won two races including the Listed Harry Rosebery Trophy *Ritual Run (bay gelding, 1995, by Rudimentary) failed to win in six races Pedigree References Category:1972 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-c ","title":"Roussalka (horse)"},{"id":"43680221","text":"Kinga Fab√≥, born 1 November 1953 in Mez≈ët√∫r, Hungary, is a Hungarian poet, linguist and essayist.

Like its predecessor, and in contrast to other Gundam series, Gundam Build Fighters Try features a tournament-based storyline where Gunpla models are built, customized, and battled. The series is directed by Shinya Watada and written by Yousuke Kuroda, who wrote the first series. Character designs were done by both Kenichi Ohnuki and Suzuhito Yasuda. The series was officially unveiled by Bandai on May 15, 2014, and began airing on TV Tokyo in Japan while streaming on YouTube in limited areas internationally on October 8, 2014. A novel spinoff is currently running in Hobby Japan starting in December 2014. Story Seven years after the events of Gundam Build Fighters, the rules of Gunpla have been renewed, and the sport becomes even more popular. However, one academy is left behind in this change, and that was Seiho Academy, which Sei Iori once attended. The only member of the Gunpla Battle Club remaining is Fumina Hoshino, who befriends Sekai Kamiki, a boy who has been training with his master in martial arts and the young Gunpla builder Yuuma Kousaka, and together, they attempt to secure a place in the world championship as the . =Gunpla Battle= Shortly after the Arista that produces Plavsky particles is destroyed in the final episode of the previous season, Plavsky Particle System Engineering (PPSE) is acquired by Yajima Trading while American scientist and Gunpla fighter Nils Nielsen and his girlfriend Caroline Yajima rediscover Plavsky particles aboard the International Space Station. With new Plavsky particles produced, the sport of Gunpla Battle continues worldwide. In Gundam Build Fighters Try, the one-on- one battle format is replaced by battles between teams of three Gunpla fighters and is divided into two categories: one for players under 19 years old and one for older players. New rules have been added to Gunpla battle: *Non-mobile suit support units such as Core Boosters count as one Gunpla unit. *Mobile suits that combine such as the ZZ Gundam or Victory Gundam count as one unit, but must be controlled by only one person when separated into multiple units. *Teams may use only one mobile armor in battle, with all three members piloting it. *Teams can change Gunpla before each match; changing Gunpla during a match is forbidden. *Each match has a 15-minute time limit. *If both teams have the same number of Gunpla left after the time limit expires, the match is declared a draw; each team will select a representative for a one-on-one battle to determine a winner. In addition, damage levels can now be set on Gunpla Battles. Damage Level C, which inflicts simulated but no physical damage on the Gunpla, is often used in practice rounds. Damage Level B results in simulated damage, but disconnected joints that can easily be fixed. For Damage Level A, Gunpla destroyed in combat are severely damaged physically and will need either replacement parts or a whole new unit altogether. Production Gundam Build Fighters Try was first announced by Sunrise on May 15, 2014 as a sequel to Gundam Build Fighters. The new series, which was stated for an October 2014 release, reunited the production staff from the previous series. On September 2014, Masashi Hirose was hospitalized for an unspecified illness after having recorded his lines as Mr. Ral for the first four episodes. A month later, he was replaced by Katsuhisa H≈çki for the rest of the series. Sunrise would release the series in North American on home video (via Right Stuf) in 2016.

The areas were previously known as Dirran State Forest. It is adjacent to Tully Gorge National Park and Mount Fisher Forest Reserve. Mount Fisher is found within the park. It is Queensland's third highest peak and the most elevated volcano in Northern Australia. The park provides habitat for the endangered spotted-tailed Quoll, large-eared horseshoe bat and the vulnerable flute-nosed bat. A total of four rare or threatened species have been recorded in the park. It is also home to over 500 native plants.

It took place on 27 September 1939 near the town of Sambor. It was among the last cavalry battles of 1939 and one of the last large-scale battles in Central Poland. It was won by the Red Army.  History  After the Battle of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders' Cavalry Operational Group () consisting of his own Nowogr√≥dzka Cavalry Brigade as well as two regiments (1st KOP Cavalry and 22nd Cavalry) of Kresowa Cavalry Brigade and other units was one of the very few Polish units to escape encirclement. General Anders decided to break through towards Hungary. On 25 September General Anders' force reached the village of W√≥lka Horyniecka, already manned by a German garrison. Anders dispatched envoys to the German commander and the Germans allowed the Polish force to pass through unopposed towards Hungary in exchange for setting free German prisoners of war taken during the battle of Krasnobr√≥d, among them General Rudolf Koch-Erpach. On 26 September 1939 Anders gathered his forces around Krakowiec, and ordered his cavalry to advance southwards, through Lubienie, Bor√≥w, Siedliska, Lipniki and Radenice. The unit moved unopposed as the German forces have already started their withdrawal towards the so-called \\"border of peace\\", or a Soviet-German demarcation line established in the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, thus leaving a narrow strip of unoccupied land. However, although the Polish unit was still a coherent force of some 2500 men, most of the soldiers have been on the front line for almost four weeks without rest. The Polish column moved all night; the commanders feared that if they allowed their men to dismount, they would fall asleep and it would be impossible to wake them back up. Overnight the column captured two Soviet lorries travelling towards Mo≈õciska, but their drivers did not disclose the location of the nearest Soviet units. The following morning the Polish unit reached the Hill 292 right outside the village of W≈Çadypol, some north of the city of Sambor and from Hungarian border. The village has already been taken by advanced Soviet forces of Gen. Ivan Tyulenev's 12th Army. As there was officially no state of war between Poland and the Soviet Union, and the advancing Soviet troops often informed local populace that they entered Poland to help the Polish Army against the German invaders, Anders dispatched Capt. Kuczy≈Ñski as an envoy to the Soviet commander, but the envoy was robbed of all his belongings by Soviet soldiers and barely escaped with his life. Soon after his return the Soviets attacked. A meeting engagement ensued in which the Polish 26th Cavalry Regiment repelled the Soviet cavalry and tank units. Simultaneously a larger Soviet force appeared in the vicinity of Chliple (modern Khlipli), some to the north-east. It was stopped by a combined force of 25th Cavalry and the 9th Mounter Artillery Regiment passing through the village of Wola Sudkowska, halfway between Chliple and W≈Çadypol. The Polish force captured Chliple and held out against the Soviets long enough for the rest of the column to pass further south, but Polish artillery exhausted all its ammunition and the guns had to be destroyed by their crews to prevent their use by the enemy. The Polish force withdrew further south, towards the B≈Ça≈ºenka Nowa stream, but the Soviets attacked once again between W≈Çadypol and the village of Rajtarowice, some west. A combined cavalry and tank force composed of the entire 34th Cavalry Division and elements of 32nd Cavalry Division. The Poles withdrew westwards, to a large forest to the north of Rajtarowice. Seeing no chances to defeat yet another Soviet unit, General Anders called up a war council in a forester's hut Jordan√≥wka near W≈Çadypol and ordered his units disperse and try to break through the Soviet units on their own. The 26th Cavalry Regiment with Anders himself in charge was to man the forest for as long as possible to cover the withdrawal. However, in the chaotic withdrawal most Polish forces, roughly 1500 men, were taken prisoner of war by the Soviets. Anders, by then wounded twice, withdrew together with a group of roughly 250 men. They broke through to the assembly point, but failed to recover contact with the remaining regiments. Surrounded by the Soviet forces once more on September 29, he dispersed his group onto groups of 10 and ordered his men to either return home or try to break through towards Hungary on their own. He was wounded for the third time soon afterwards and was captured by the Soviets. He was among the very few high-ranking Polish officers to survive the Katyn Massacre of the following year.  Casualties  Early Polish sources cited overall Polish casualties as roughly 100 killed in action and twice as many wounded. However, it is possible that the actual casualties on the Polish side were much lower and did not exceed 20 killed. Soviet casualties are unknown, but were certainly higher, among the killed was Major Diegtariev, commanding officer of the Soviet 148th Cavalry Regiment.

Jarlskog obtained her doctorate in 1970 in theoretical particle physics at the Technical University of Lund.Personal page at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical PhysicsPersonal page at Academia Europaea, Graz Information Centre She is known for her work on CP violation in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, introducing what is known as the Jarlskog invariant,Jarlskog C. Commutator of the Quark Mass Matrices in the Standard Electroweak Model and a Measure of Maximal CP Violation (1985) Physical Review Letters, 55, pp. 1039-1042. and for her work on grand unified theories (see Georgi‚ÄìJarlskog mass relation).Georgi H., Jarlskog C. A new lepton-quark mass relation in a unified theory (1979) Physics Letters B, 86 (3-4), pp. 297-300. Research interests Cecilia Jarlskog is mainly known for her study and expertise in theoretical particle physics. Her studies include research on the ways that sub-atomic and electronic constituents of matter cohere or lose their symmetry, matter and antimatter asymmetry, mathematical physics, neutrino physics, and grand unification.Doctor in Scientiis, Trinity College Dublin The Jarlskog invariant or rephasing-invariant CP violation parameter, is an invariant quantity in particle physics, which is in the order of ¬±2.8 x 10‚àí5. This parameter is related to the unitarity conditions of the Cabibbo‚ÄìKobayashi‚ÄìMaskawa matrix, which can be expressed as triangles whose sides are products of different elements of the matrix. As such, the Jarlskog invariant can be written as J = ¬±Im(VusVcbVV), which amounts to twice the area of the unitarity triangle. Because the area vanishes for the specific parameters in the Standard Model for which there would be no CP violation, this invariant is thus very useful to quantify the non-conservation of the CP-symmetry in elementary particle physics. It is one of Jarlskog's foremost contributions to physics, the other being the many years that she was an active member of CERN.Speaker page of the 2011 Conference, Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland She recalls her appreciation of CERN‚Äôs (European Organization for Nuclear Research) international atmosphere. Being a part of this community gave her great opportunities to meet and talk with inspiring physicists from across the world. She noted that she felt fortunate to have 'lived in a period when the amount of information revealed about the nature of the elementary constituents of matter and their interactions has been mind-boggling'. At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers probe the fundamental structure of the universe. The world's largest and most complex scientific instruments are employed to study the basic constituents of matter ‚Äì fundamental particles. The particles are caused to collide at close to the speed of light, which affords physicists clues about the interactions of particles, and insights into the fundamental laws of nature. Career Jarlskog was appointed professor at the University of Bergen, Norway, in 1976. In 1985 she switched to the University of Stockholm, Sweden, staying there until 1994. Since then, Jarlskog has been a professor at Lund University, her alma mater, where she had graduated in 1970 with a PhD in theoretical particle physics. Jarlskog worked as a member of CERN from 1970 to 1972. In addition, she served on the CERN Scientific Policy committee from 1982 to 1988. In her remaining 6 years at CERN, she served as the Advisor to the Director General of CERN on Member States, from 1998 to 2004. Jarlskog was recognized by the Swedish Academy of Science community and was appointed as one of the 5 members of the Swedish Nobel Committee for Physics from 1989 to 2000, serving as chairman of that committee in 1999, when the prize was awarded to Gerard 't Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman. Jarlskog is an Honorary Professor at three universities in China and received an honorary degree from the University College Dublin. She was also Member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences (1984), Member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences (1987), Member of the Board of Trustees of the Nobel Foundation (1996) and Member of the Academia Europaea (2005). Books and articles Cecilia Jarlskog wrote the book, Portrait of Gunnar K√§ll√©n: A Physics Shooting Star and Poet of Early Quantum Field Theory, while a member of CERN. Here she relates the accomplishments of a comparatively unknown physicist in quantum physics.

Early life Farrell was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, third son of Andrew Farrell, a chemist, and his wife Mary n√©e Parley. His parents left Dublin, Ireland in 1847 and settled in Buenos Aires. Towards the end of 1852 Andrew Farrell went to Victoria (Australia), with his wife, and children, and engaged first in gold-digging, and then in carrying, before settling down as a farmer. John Farrell was initially educated by his parents and later at a private school. His mother died in 1862, and he had little formal education although his father encouraged his taste for reading. The boy worked on farms, and when he was 19 worked in a brewery at Bendigo, Victoria. He spent some time in Darwin, Northern Territory, gold-digging and then travelled around Australia for some time, working as a brewer again, spending time as a farmer or brewer for several years. Literary career In 1878 Farrell published, using the name John O'Farrell, Ephemera: An Iliad of Albury, a small pamphlet of verse, and a rare Australian publication. Two Stories, a Fragmentary Poem was published in Melbourne in 1882, and about this period he began to be a regular contributor to The Bulletin. He was then working in a brewery at Albury, New South Wales and in 1883 was a partner in a brewery at Goulburn. He became much interested in the tenets of Henry George after reading Progress and Poverty. In January 1887 a collection of Farrell's verses was published in Sydney entitled How He Died and Other Poems which was favourably reviewed. Also in 1887 he sold his brewery interests and went to Sydney hoping to obtain employment as a journalist. He bought a paper, the Lithgow, New South Wales Enterprise, but was unable to make it a financial success, and in 1889 returned to Sydney to edit the Australian Standard, a single tax paper for which Farrell did much writing. In 1888 Farrell started a paper called, \\"The Land Nationalizer\\" at Lithgow, and it was as the advocate of the single-tax doctrine that he was first known outside purely literary circles. P. Stenhouse, John Farrell and his friends, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, 8 (2) (1987), 40-54. In October 1889 Farrell began a series of articles on George's theories for the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and in the following year joined its staff. When Henry George arrived in Sydney in March he was met by Farrell who accompanied him on his inland tour, they became great friends. In June 1890 Farrell was appointed editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, but soon decided he could not cope and resigned three months later. Late life and legacy Farrell continued to be a regular contributor to the Telegraph until 1903 due to Bright's disease on 8 January 1904. Farrell had married in November 1876 Elizabeth Watts, who survived him with four sons and three daughters. In 1904 a memorial edition of Farrell's poems was published with a memoir by the critic Bertram Stevens under the title of My Sundowner and other Poems. This was re-issued in 1905 as How He Died and other Poems. The contents differ substantially from the 1887 volume of the same name. Farrell's gravestone is inscribed with: :Sleep Heart of Gold!

History The technology is believed to have been created by the US Navy in the 1950s: during sonar tests on submarines, it was discovered that the areas surrounding the sonar transducers were cleaner than the rest of the hull. Since then, research has been conducted into the effectiveness of different frequencies and intensities of ultrasonic waves on various marine life, such as barnacles, mussels and algae. Commercial ultrasonic systems have been used to control algal blooms in ponds, harbours and reservoirs.\\"LG Sonic Tholen harbour\\" In controlling the algae, the first stage in the fouling sequence is halted, acting as a prevention, rather than a cure as with traditional anti- fouling paint. Theory Acoustic cavitation\\"Acoustic Cavitation Explained - H2oBioSonic\\" can be predicted theoretically through the calculation of acoustic pressure and where this pressure is low enough, the liquid can reach its vaporisation pressure. This results in localised vaporisation of the liquid, forming small bubbles; these collapse quickly and with tremendous energy and turbulence, generating heat on the order of 5000K and pressures of the order of several atmospheres.Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol 64, pp. 233-252, 1985. \\"Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions. P. Riesz, D. Berdahl, and CL Christman At lower intensity levels, this rapid pressure change is enough to create small movements of the surrounding water, making it extremely difficult for marine life to firmly attach to a surface. Research has also shown that low-intensity ultrasound has an effect on behavior of some species without inducing cavitation, such as inhibiting the settlement of barnacle cyprids. Modern usage Modern commercial systems are available in a wide range of powers and installation variants, however all use similar ceramic piezoelectric transducer as the ultrasound source. There are dedicated systems for: * Pool cleaning (to reduce chemicals necessary to prevent algae blooms) * Ship hull protection (to prevent fouling, increasing speed and reducing fuel costs) * Heat exchanger protection (to extend operational cycles between cleaning) * Seachest / water intakes (to prevent blockages by marine growth) * Fuel tank protection (to stop algae growth and prevent diesel contamination) * Protection of offshore structures (such as wind farms, oil & gas installations etc.) * HVAC Cooling Towers to reduce or eliminate chemical dosing treatment However, most of these systems are controlled by fairly simple variable- frequency drive units, which run random frequencies in the ultrasonic spectrum of 20‚Äì45 kHz over an operational cycle. Intelligent systems will target specific frequencies, as well as manage power consumption, protect batteries & power supplies and come with various other features and options such as remote monitoring, alarm systems and daylight sensors. Several companies have patents on their intelligent systems.\\"Ultrasonic Antifouling - CleanAHull.com.au\\"\\"CMS Marine\\"\\"Ultrasonic Works\\" Some systems will actually automatically calibrate after installation and target the ideal frequency range for the substrate to maximize effectiveness.\\"CleanAHull.com\\"\\"HullSonic.com.au ‚Äì Ultrasonic Antifouling\\" Limitations Ultrasonic anti-fouling should not be considered a complete replacement for traditional anti-fouling paints; instead, it should be viewed as a preventative measure to deter marine growth from a surface. Most companies will suggest applying a coat of ‚Äòhard‚Äô antifouling paint. Ultrasonic systems cannot work on wooden-hulled vessels, or vessels made from ferro-cement. Vessels with foam or wooden cored composite hulls will require modification to the hull in the specific locations that the transducers are to be installed. Ultrasonic systems will work with reduced effectiveness on vibration isolated fittings, such as sterndrives. This is because the hull must pass the ultrasound waves from the transducer located inside the hull through to the water, and these materials act to dampen the amplitude of ultrasonic waves.

The Ephraim Williams was a sailing ship wrecked off the coast of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, during a late December storm, late in 1884. The rescue of the barkentine's crew by Benjamin B. Dailey and his six oarsmen of the United States Lifesaving Service was considered particularly heroic, and the rescue is celebrated to the present day. The 491-ton vessel's homeport was Providence, Rhode Island. She was returning there with a load of timber from Savannah, Georgia, when she became waterlogged and unmanageable on December 18, 1884, off Frying Pan Shoals. The vessel became visible to staff at four lifesaving stations on December 21. Heavy surf made launching a rescue boat extremely hazardous. Only the waterlogged wreck's masts were visible. Lifesaving staff couldn't tell whether there were any survivors to try to rescue. The vessel was seen again on the morning of December 22, off Diamond Shoal. Cape Hatteras is the easternmost tip of a chain of barrier islands. Off the beach are an inner and outer sandbank. The difficulty in crossing the outer sandbank increases with the size of the waves. When the Ephraim Williams crew raised a distress flag, shortly before 10:30 am, confirming there were survivors onboard who needed rescue, surfboats from several stations launched to attempt a rescue. The second in command of Dailey's lifeboat stated that his wife was dying at home, and he had no wish to make his children orphans. Patrick H. Etheridge, the keeper of the nearby Creed's Hill Lifesaving Station quickly volunteered to take his place. The crew of the rescue surfboat of the Cape Hatteras Lifesaving Station proved it was possible to cross the sandbank, during heavy weather, with precise timing, and extreme effort, in order cross the bar at the height of a wave. With enough effort they proved a skilled and determined crew could cross over the bar before it was swept by the next trough. The crews of the other surfboats were unable to cross the outer bar. The surfboat's crew then rowed five miles to the distressed vessel. Crew members had to board the stricken vessel and bodily carry some of the exhausted crew to the boat. Dailey and Etheridge switched roles, and Etheridge guided the boat during the dangerous return to shore. Observers described the waves that day as the worst they had ever seen, and described their concern that the rescuers themselves would lose their lives. The officer that recommended the crew receive the US Coast Guard Gold Lifesaving Medal wrote: I do not believe that a greater act of heroism is recorded than that of Dailey and his crew on this momentous occasion. These poor, plain men, dwellers upon the lonely sands of Hatteras, took their lives in their hands and, at the most imminent risk, crossed the most tumultuous sea that any boat within the memory of living men had ever attempted on that bleak coast, and all for what. That others might live to see home and friends. The thought of reward or mercenary appeal never once entered their minds. Duty, their sense of obligation, and the credit of the Service impelled them to do their mighty best. The names of Benjamin B. Dailey and his comrades in this magnificent feat should never be forgotten. As long as the Life-Saving Service has the good fortune to number among its keepers and crews such men as these, no fear need ever be entertained for its good name or purposes. David Stick, the author of Graveyard of the Atlantic: Shipwrecks of the North Carolina Coast, noted that: \\"During the first thirty years of operation of the Lifesaving Service on the North Carolina coast a total of twelve Gold Lifesaving Medals, the highest such award made by our government, were presented for exceptional bravery in saving life.\\" Of this number, seven‚Äîmore than half‚Äîwere awarded to the lifesavers from Cape Hatteras and Creed's Hill stations who rescued the crew of the barkentine Ephraim Williams, December 22, 1884. Dailey's crew consisted of oarsmen Isaac L. Jennett, Thomas Gray, John H. Midgett, Jabez B. Jennett, and Patrick H. Etheridge, the station keeper at nearby Creed's Hill, who was filling in for an absent oarsman. Dailey's medal remains on display at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore's Hatteras Island Visitor Center and Museum of the Sea.

Built about 1780 for a prominent local merchant, it is one of the city's few surviving 18th-century buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Michael Reade House stands on the southern fringe of Dover's central business district, on the east side of Main Street opposite the Cocheco Mills complex. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with the outer bays symmetrically placed and the center bay, where the entrance is located, skewed slightly to the left. The entry is flanked by sidelight windows and is sheltered by a mid-to-late 19th century Victorian bracketed hood. The interior follows a central chimney plan, but has an unusually wide chimney bay, suggestive of the idea that the chimney may have been built after the frame instead of before. There is fine Georgian- style wood paneling in the kitchen and southwest parlor, and transitional Federal woodwork in other rooms. The house was built about 1780 for Michael Reade, an Irish immigrant who came to North America in 1741, and was one of Dover's leading merchants. The house is located near the historic Dover Landing area, where his ships would have docked. This area had a larger number of fine Georgian and Federal houses, most of which were demolished to make way for the mills and worker housing.

The building, still housing municipal offices, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history Rollinsford Town Hall is located on the south side of Main Street, at its junction with 4th Street, a few blocks west of the heart of the town's business district. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a high brick foundation. A four-story tower projects slightly from the northeast corner, capped by a pyramidal roof. Although the building has been clad in vinyl siding, some of its original Victorian trim is still in place, along the main roof eave and that of the tower. The main entrance is in the base of the tower facing north, sheltered by a gabled porch with round Ionic columns set on brick piers. The gable front is broken by a half-round lunette with spindles descending. Its first floor is occupied by offices, and its upper floor is taken up by an auditorium space with balcony and stage. The basement level, accessible from 4th Street, has a garage door opening which was originally used to house fire equipment. The building was designed by Alvah Ramsdell, a regionally prominent architect, and was completed in 1893. It is the first of four similar town halls designed by Ramsdell; the others are found in Alton, Wakefield, and New Durham, and share a similarity of layout on the interior, and the presence of a corner tower. This has been the town's only dedicated town hall. Established in 1849 by separation from Somersworth, the town's municipal functions were held in a variety of private spaces prior to the construction of this building.

It was launched in November 2013 as part of the Bright-star Target Explorer (BRITE) programme. The spacecraft was launched aboard a Dnepr rocket. Named after the Polish science fiction writer Stanis≈Çaw Lem, it is an optical astronomy spacecraft built by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences and operated by Centrum Astronomiczne im. Miko≈Çaja Kopernika PAN; one of two Polish contributions to the BRITE constellation along with the Heweliusz satellite. Features Lem is the first Polish scientific satellite, and the second (after PW-Sat) ever launched. Along with Heweliusz, TUGSAT-1, UniBRITE-1 and BRITE-Toronto, it is one from a constellation of six nanosatellites of the BRIght-star Target Explorer project, operated by a consortium of universities from Canada, Austria and Poland. Lem was developed and manufactured by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 2011, based around the Generic Nanosatellite Bus, and had a mass at launch of (plus another 7 kg for the XPOD separation system). The satellite is used, along with four other operating spacecraft, to conduct photometric observations of stars with an apparent magnitude brighter than 4.0 as seen from Earth. Lem was one of two Polish BRITE satellites launched, along with the Heweliusz spacecraft. Four more satellites‚Äîtwo Austrian and two Canadian‚Äîwere launched at different dates.  Mission  Lem observes the stars in the blue color range, whereas Heweliusz does it in red. Due to the multicolour option, geometrical and thermal effects in the analysis of the observed phenomena are separated. None of the much larger satellites, such as MOST and CoRoT, has this colour option; this is crucial in the diagnosis of the internal structure of stars. Lem photometrically measures low-level oscillations and temperature variations in stars brighter than visual magnitude (4.0), with unprecedented precision and temporal coverage not achievable through terrestrial based methods. Launch The Lem satellite was launched from the Russian Yasny air base aboard a Dnepr through the BRITE-PL Project satellite launch programme established in 2009 by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences and The Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences in cooperation with University of Toronto. The launch was subcontracted to the Russian Ministry of Defence which launched the satellites using Dnepr rocket from the Yasny air base along with 33 other satellites. The launch took place at 07:10 (UTC) on 21 November 2013, and the rocket deployed all of its payloads successfully.

The goal of the program was to demonstrate rapid development and fielding of secure mobile apps in the battlefield. With its agile and user-centric approach, the DARPA program specifically addressed the limitations of slow requirements-centric software development cycle followed by many Army programs of record. The TransApps program created a rapid development and enhancements process within the tactical environment, and embedded a small team of trainers and developers within the deployed military units in Afghanistan, the program also tackled a wide range of issues related to hardware and software security, agile map-imagery distribution and enhancements, combat radio integration, disconnected and connected use, and third party app testing and integration. Unlike a typical DARPA program at the time, the program brought together multiple contractors and Government personnel in a co-located incubator-like environment during the program lifetime. By the end of the program, roughly fifty apps were deployed in the secure operational environment.  Timeline  The TransApps Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was released in March 2010.https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&mode;=form&id;=366136beefbaf1b041863f3d61cfc8fb&tab;=core&_cview=0 The BAA noted a range of potential use cases, including tactical battlefield applications, as well as humanitarian missions and disaster recovery. The TransApps program was devised and initially managed by Dr. Mari Maeda who also developed a previous successful DARPA project, the Tactical Ground Reporting System (TIGR). TIGR was one of the first defense-related efforts to place modern web and server technologies in the hands of warfighters. TIGR emphasized the collection, sharing, and persisting of information in real- time, mainly through mapping capabilities. TIGR began in 2007 and was led by Dr. Mari Maeda as part of the DARPA Information Processing Techniques Office. In 2009, General Peter Chiarelli, at the time the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, noted, \\"Today, TIGR is arming Soldiers from 17 combat brigades in Iraq and Afghanistan with exactly what they need - the best information and knowledge available to them on the ground in real time.\\" The project received strong support from the military, and was slotted for transition to the Army in 2012.http://www.army.mil/article/28700/tigr-allows-soldiers-to-be-there- before-they-arrive/ However, with the onset and quick omnipresence of smart phones, by 2010 there was a need to expand the TIGR platform and accelerate its capabilities in sync with the new smart phone technologies.For an overview of trends in handheld devices for the military http://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2013-05/jewell.pdf DARPA Director, Arati Prabhakar, noted that at the time, soldiers still were relying on paper maps for situational awareness. Soldiers struggled with piecing together the vast range of data to create a common operating picture within a tactical environment.http://information-awareness- office.org/IAO___DARPA_NEWS_PAGE12_.html Many of the existing requirements of the TIGR application provided the foundation for the follow-on baseline requirements for TransApps. These included a renewed emphasis on user-centric development, as well as a focus on security, functionality under limited connectivity, and a broader suite of applications.http://www.aerotechnews.com/news/2013/11/18/darpa-focuses-on- technology-for-national-security/ TransApps was initially awarded in September 2010 to the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), with the focus on building a secure, mobile app store.http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/military-mobile-apps-store- gets-64m-open This was followed a few years later with a contract awarded to Metronome to build out the app store.http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2013/07/metronome-cyber- app.html The app store, simply referred to as the ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù emphasizes a flexible and extensible environment to meet a wide range of mission needs, within a collaborative development environment to optimize DARPA‚Äôs investment.http://www.adlnet.gov/resources/apps-on-a-global-object-repository- architecture-agora-and-the-transformative-apps-project?type=presentation Moreover, it serves as a key component in innovating the acquisition process, expediting the time from application development to mission use. Over time, Metronome has expanded the marketplace to focus on mobile and cyber security as well.http://information-awareness-office.org/IAO___DARPA_NEWS_PAGE6.html While there has been much success, TransApps initially relied upon the Dell Streak, which was discontinued in 2011. Since then, the TransApps platform has adjusted to function on a range of hardware, including Motorola Xoom, Galaxy Note, and Samsung S4. In addition to security, additional emphasis has also been placed on usability and visualization via the iWarrior SBIR that falls under TransApps.https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444772804577621950655761214 In 2012, TransApps was identified as one of the top 25 C4ISR breakthroughs of the year.http://www.defensenews.com/article/20121009/C4ISR02/310090013/C4ISR- Journal-Big-25-Year-8217-s-Biggest-Breakthroughs In April 2013, DARPA awarded a contract to GXM Consulting to continue to expand the functionality and robustness of the smartphones.http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2013/04/DARPA- Transformative-Apps.html TransApps not only has focused on security abroad, but has also employed the capabilities domestically. TransApps supported first response and law enforcement personnel during the 2013 Presidential Inauguration.http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/spie/performance-assessments-of- android-powered-military-applications-lCb0dj45Pa That same year, TransApps also was present at the Boston Marathon, providing similar support for first responders, and did so again at the 2014 Boston Marathon. During FY2014, TransApps is working with the Army Nett Warrior Program to fully transition the project to the Army as a program of record.  The TransApps Ecosystem: DARPA-Hard Innovations  The TransApps program pursued novel functionality and security for the operational user, but also pursued a new acquisition paradigm to significantly decrease the time and money from development to operational use. TransApps was required to create a modern mobile capability within the constraints of a tactical operating environment. The applications are the most visible feature, and required and benefited from constant feedback from the user community. However, the vast majority of the innovations dealt both with expediting the acquisition process to deliver timely capabilities for the warfighter, as well as handling the network/security and operations/logistics within a tactical environment. =Altering the Acquisition Paradigm= The normal DARPA acquisition process involves three to four months of selecting a winning proposal, an additional three to four months to negotiate the contract, and then continuing with the same vendor for three to five years. In contrast, the TransApps program sought to replicate best practices from the commercial world, including an integrated and collaborative working environment indicative of a start-up, and quickly moving from development to mission use. The TransApps program pursued a ‚Äúwarfighter empowered acquisition‚Äù mentality to field capabilities faster and in sync with current warfighter requirements.http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=239 TransApps sought to establish a new acquisition model that can circumvent the standard bureaucratic delays with developing and fielding capabilities. This new business model required navigating both technological as well as bureaucratic hurdles to quickly field the new applications.For an overview of some of the hurdles and lessons learned from DoD acquisition, see: http://www.aei.org/speech/foreign-and-defense-policy/defense/dhs-acquisition- practices-improving-outcomes-for-taxpayers-using-defense-and-private-sector- lessons-learne/ In 2012, Maeda, then the deputy director, Defense Sciences Office at DARPA said, \\"Today, we have 3-to-4000 users in an ongoing program in Afghanistan using a secure, robust Android handheld device. We roll out new capabilities every three to four months, from new apps to new server capabilities.\\"http://www.army.mil/article/82183/ TransApps not only pursued a new model for acquisition, but also represented a shift in development processes, one that entailed placing the engineers in the users‚Äô environment. In 2012, a TransApps team, including computer scientists, spent nine months in Afghanistan to gather user requirements, and develop and test applications. They also were able to reach back to the larger TransApps team in the United States to expedite development and quickly provide capabilities to tactical users.http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120525/C4ISR01/305250007/DARPA- Device-Lauded-by-U-S-Soldiers-Afghanistan Instead of fielding capabilities at the end of the development process, the TransApps pilot efforts gathered immediate feedback, identifying quickly which requirements were met, technical bugs in devices, as well as ideas for the next development cycles based explicitly on user feedback.http://www.aerotechnews.com/news/2013/11/18/darpa- focuses-on-technology-for-national-security http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120525/C4ISR01/305250007/DARPA-Device- Lauded-by-U-S-Soldiers-Afghanistan DARPA has worked with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command‚Äôs Communications-Electronics Center (CERDEC) to ensure downrange support and mission-driven development.http://armyalt.va.newsmemory.com/rss.php?date=20120406&edition;=Army+AL%26T+Magazine&subsection;=Field+Expedient&page;=118alt2012april- june_fieldexpedient.pdf.0&id;=art_0.xml&device;= As Doran Michels, the DARPA Program Manager in charge of TransApps, explained in a December 2013 press release, ‚ÄúWe wanted soldiers to drive the development of the applications so we knew the apps could evolve in real time with dynamic mission requirements.‚Äùhttp://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121320 Less than a year after awarding the TransApp program, a pilot program was underway with the 3rd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan to test the mobile devices running the Android OS. In addition to testing the security, the TransApps team also developed a dozen applications by mid-Fall 2011. This pilot effort helped harden the requirement for functionality within disconnected as well as connected environments.http://gcn.com/Articles/2012/01/31/DARPA-apps-program-DOD- Android-smart-phones.aspx?Page=1 The development process can be viewed as a ‚Äòwireless to the edge‚Äô approach, tightly integrating with potential tactical users. This has provided the opportunity to ensure usability and applicability across an array of use cases. The initial requirements focused on high- resolution mobile imagery and additional ways to interact with and navigate the geospatial applications. Once these initial requirements were satisfied, the users immediately began identifying and asking for additional functionality. In many instances, users identified novel use cases that extended beyond the original intent, and thus expanded the utility of the mobile devices.https://ronna.apan.org/CAAT/Shared%20Documents/110902_NIU_CAAT_RCS_SNEIL110902_SP_Wireless_to_the_Edge.pdf For instance, although the handheld devices first emerged as a way to explore and interact with detailed maps, it soon became apparent that they could also be used as collection platforms.http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121320 The involvement of the user community had operational impacts as early as 2012. According to a Wall Street Journal article, \\"During a battle in a village near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Lt. Kevin Pelletier used a tablet computer with a custom map application to direct soldiers' movements. As thousands of rounds flew through the village near Kandahar, Lt. Pelletier used the device to more quickly direct the movement of his soldiers. Two days later, the village was cleared with zero casualties.\\" Not only did this process impact immediate operational support, but also helped set the foundation for scaling the capability. The reiterative process between user feedback and development efforts enabled the quick escalation from application within smaller units to company, battalion and then brigade levels.http://seekingalpha.com/article/867571-military-ops-a-new-market-for- these-5-tech-stocks, citing the article: Spencer E. Ante. \\"Military Takes Apps to War: Soldiers Use Mobile Devices for Mapping, Networking, Virtual Lineups.\\" The Wall Street Journal, September 4, 2012. Similarly, Major Tim Terese has used the TransApps smartphone to plan operations in Afghanistan, and called it a, ‚Äúvast improvement in dismounted situational awareness.‚Äùhttp://www.defensenews.com/article/20131204/C4ISRNET13/312040021/How- DARPA-delivers-tactical-apps-mobile-devices-field =Security & the Tactical Environment= TransApps focuses on developing functionality on an Android platform, emphasizing the requirement to securely function within limited bandwidth environments as well as without connectivity.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/04/darpa_app_store/ Android was chosen over iOS systems due to the open architecture that would enable modifications for developers to create a secure kernel for the operating system.http://defensesystems.com/Articles/2013/12/12/DARPA-Transformative- Apps-Afghanistan.aspx?Page=2 DARPA customized the Android kernel, hardening the stack and implementing the ability to check for data integrity. The stack included a custom-modified Android-operating system and Linux kernels, with a security stack that includes protection for data at rest, data in transit, authentication, and app vetting and control.http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121320 Unlike in the commercial world, where security resides on the network, due to the patchy communications in theater, TransApps needed to adjust to ensure security resided within the phone itself. According to Michels, the security is so robust that ‚Äúit would take several CPU years to crack the log-in password on a military Android.‚Äù TransApps also had to ensure that the devices could integrate with the existing military infrastructure. The smartphones needed software that could recognize and function within the particular data constraints of whatever waveform was used, be it PRC-152, MPU4 or Satcom.http://www.c4isrnet.com/article/M5/20131204/C4ISRNET13/312040021/How- DARPA-delivers-tactical-apps-mobile-devices-field This is essential, as data outages occur often in theater, and the handheld devices needed to contain the essential data in the event of a communications loss.http://gcn.com/Articles/2012/01/31/DARPA-apps-program-DOD-Android-smart- phones.aspx?Page=3 The secure system uses military radios rather than commercial, wifi or cellular networks, according to DARPA.http://fcw.com/articles/2012/01/31/darpa-apps-program-dod-android-smart- phones.aspx?s=fcwdaily_010212 TransApps expanded the emphasis on security in 2012, and included the Mobile Armour program. Awarded in June 2012, the Mobile Armour component intends to secure both smartphones and tablet devices in the battlefield.http://information-awareness- office.org/IAO___DARPA_NEWS_PAGE6.html Similarly, Vanderbilt‚Äôs ISIS research lab has implemented a means to securely connect the smartphones to military- grade radios to secure chat, video, text and blue force tacking.http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/02/12/researchers-work-to-secure- military-smartphones/ =App Testing Portal= Working together, the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) and George Mason have run 200,000 applications through application testing software and evaluation of the various technological requirements of distinct application.http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/national-security-agency- plans-smartphone-adoption/d/d-id/1102643? As a senior researcher at NIST, Tom Karygiannis worked on TransApps and other government programs to help inform NIST‚Äôs 2012 mobile security guidelines.http://breakinggov.com/2012/07/12/nist- issues-new-mobile-security-guidelines/ In addition, not all of the NIST‚Äôs findings were security related, but also addressed issues such as the impact of the application color schema on battery life. According to Jeff Voas, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt send them out on a mission where some application, because it‚Äôs got a really red screen, sucks the battery dry and the phone‚Äôs only good for a couple of hours as opposed to the 16-hour mission.‚Äùhttp://www.fiercemobilegovernment.com/story/nist-vetting-commercial- android-apps-security-battery-use/2013-02-27 These nuances of an operating environment added to the complexity and drove innovation within the security and hardware of the mobile phones. For instance, it was imperative that information could not be obtained via lost or stolen devices. Invincea was awarded a grant to test security along these lines in Afghanistan with 3,000 soldiers. Part of this effort was to ensure that adversaries could not capture information on the devices, while also isolating malicious Web Apps from seemingly harmless sites to take control of the device.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-07-01/android- security/56020462/1 TransApps addressed the inter-app security layer through the FUSE project, which focused on defending against data exfiltration by multiple colluding apps. The FUSE app analysis tool helped compute over- approximations of data intent calls without any false negatives. The project also evaluated the Java bytecode as part of the overarching feasibility study for the TransApps project.http://www.gilith.com/research/talks/hcss2012.pdf =Functional App Testing= DARPA has designed and implemented evaluation and testing strategies for the platform. This includes the functionality of the applications, software-hardware interactions, as well as the online application marketplace.http://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/m/military+power+applications.html NIST also conducted functional regression testing and quantitative performance testing in the realms of platform integration, client-based applications, and network technologies. Given the technical constraints and functional requirements, the app testing required a range of security, functional and hardware testing. App testing included testing for different users with different permission levels, various browsers, ease of navigation and use, as well as a range of additional tests targeted at data collection and GPS accuracy. It also included testing on client-based capabilities as well as user-centered testing for bugs, news features, and crashes.http://www.itea.org/~iteaorg/images/pdf/conferences/2013_Annual/Track_4_Anthony_Downs.pdf TransApps became part of a larger effort by the NIST to instantiate app testing guidelines within a secure environment. As Tom Karygiannis noted, the NIST produced voluntary guidelines for the government on how to ‚Äúvet and test mobile apps before you deploy them. It doesn't give you a go or no-go or red light, green light type of thing, but it gives you an idea of what you should test for. Then, in turn, you would need your own security analyst to decide in your environment whether that's acceptable or not.\\"http://www.federalnewsradio.com/473/3370635/Federal-mobile-apps-lack- standard-security-processes =Applications= SMART Triage ‚Äì an app that lets first responders document the characteristics of the injured personnel, and log injuries and treatmentsTransApps initially identified several key areas for application development, including: blue-force tracking, speech recognition, cultural training, human terrain mapping, mission planning and biometrics.http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=239 The initial requirements focused on geospatial mapping capabilities. For instance, a heat map enabled soldiers during pre-mission briefings to see where they spent their time on patrol, the most frequently used routes, and which areas were underrepresented.http://armyalt.va.newsmemory.com/rss.php?date=20120406&edition;=Army+AL%26T+Magazine&subsection;=Field+Expedient&page;=118alt2012april- june_fieldexpedient.pdf.0&id;=art_0.xml&device; The TransHeat app utilizes algorithms to process travel routes, and visually depict for the soldiers the frequency by which they travel each route. This can assist soldiers in taking alternative routes, and provide less predictability in their behavior, which in turn can help them avoid ambushes, IEDs and roadside bombers.http://pubmemo.com/i/federal-government/2013/darpa-pioneers-tactical- mobile-devices-for-soldiers_1222708.html A variety of applications also focus on enabling soldiers to collaborate and share data, track operations, and debrief and replay missions.http://trajectorymagazine.com/got- geoint/item/1639-mobilizing-military-missions.html At the request of the National Park Service, TransApps created SMART Triage ‚Äì an app that lets first responders document the characteristics of the injured personnel, and log injuries and treatments. It depicts a 3-D mannequin that can be annotated with medications and other treatments. Additional applications assist in the search and rescue mission. The Search and Rescue Application (SARApp) allows users to search and collect data, including georeferencing and time stamps, to facilitate reporting and response management. This includes a range of data, such as photos, imagery, and audio recordings, which are displayed on a map.http://www . The smartphone also includes language translation capabilities across a range of language.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iwt.android.trt.P400&hl;=en Finally, an app was created during one of the TransApps hackathons to enable soldiers to track their daily workouts and caloric intake. Called GPX Fitness, the app was fully functional within six days and was created by a team of three developers.https://github.com/kasmus/Sample-Projects In sum, these handheld devices possess a range of functionality, including maps, collaboration, collection and even text messaging. A unit Operations Officer stated, ‚ÄúI feel that this device will be able to replace 4 or 5 different things they need to carry on mission.‚Äùhttp://ig.praevius.com/blog/2013/10/smartphones-combat Screenshot showing TransApps apps Download Presentation =Plug-in Architecture Framework= In her testimony to the House of Representative‚Äôs Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats, and Capabilities Arati Prabhakar, the DARPA director, described the TransApps plug-in architecture framework as creating, ‚Äúa new agile development process, integration framework, and customized test cycles to allow rapid development of new applications, with new features and enhancements deployed quickly based on Soldiers‚Äô evolving requirements. When Soldiers need new apps, they can get them quickly ‚Äì sometimes the very next day. This is a radical departure from how they had been operating. The TransApps ecosystem bridges old and new, allowing future technologies to work seamlessly with legacy radios and information systems. By endowing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones with custom multilayered security and agile development processes modified for the tactical community, TransApps is creating a scalable and sustainable infrastructure template.‚Äùfile:///Users/andrealimbago/Downloads/DrPrabhakarStatement14May14SACDHearing.pdf This plug-in architecture framework was designed to ensure the applications work together seamlessly, with the ability of the entire system to merge into the existing operational architecture. Moreover, the open application programming interfaces (API) emphasize the ability of third party apps to plug and play into the environment. For instance, more than 30% of the applications include third party libraries, some of which download and run code from remote servers.http://www.gilith.com/research/talks/hcss2012.pdf =Mobile Imagery Tools= Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the DARPA director, has noted that until recently soldiers have historically relied on fairly primitive mapping capabilities in the field. That is, soldiers have relied largely on paper maps, written notes and reference materials and voice radio transmissions to carry out their missions. With TransApps, users can now update imagery, such as new bridges, unique structures or demographic information within a TransApps mapping capability.> Current, high-resolution imagery is essential in disconnected environments. Collection date becomes an extremely important piece of meta-data to gain the trust of the users. Also, unlike other environments, the map imagery could not be streamed, but rather must be loaded onto the SD card, which also limits the amount of imagery that can be loaded. In order to expedite the imagery provisioning process, TransApps developed Tile Generator, which enables users to load common imagery formats into a viewer and crop the image, and only releases CPU power based on the user‚Äôs requirements to help extend the battery life. Similarly, the PanthrTiles manage a large cache of tiles and incorporates new tiles based on the Tile Generator‚Äôs output. Future releases will also provide the ability to output to the new OGC GeoPackage specification as a container.http://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2007 The TransApps also designed map features such that they are resident at all times on the handheld devices. The various interactive features enable soldiers to navigate or follow mission plans or track environmental features. The map imagery sets can be easily customizable for specific missions. Moreover, the information gathered in theater can be shared to ensure that user-created data does not remain inaccessible to others.http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121320 The mission-planning tools allow soldiers to review the presence of any man- made objects, obstacles, or known areas for avoidance, such as IEDs. Soldiers can also review the locations of previous missions and attacks within the general vicinity.http://trajectorymagazine.com/got- geoint/item/1639-mobilizing-military-missions.html The DARPA TransApps program has collaborated extensively with other agencies, such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), as well as geo-spatial data providers such as Digital Globe, to bring imagery to mobile devices. Michels has noted, ‚ÄúWe have a number of excellent relationships now with organizations like the Army Geospatial Center(AGC), NGA and NRL,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúand we would not have been successful without these thriving partnerships.‚Äùhttp://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121320 Thanks to these partnerships, TransApps has helped socialize standard imagery formats for mobile applications, and leverages other agencies‚Äô innovations, such as NRL‚Äôs GHub Sync for dissemination. =Technical Community Outreach= TransApps has reached out to academia, and the public and private sectors to help bring commercial-quality innovation to the public sector. TransApps has benefited from a cross-pollination of people and ideas as part of the public- private partnership.Some examples of individuals with experience with the TransApp program and the commercial sector include: Lee,Nacho Solis, Bowen Zhou, and Angelos Stavrous This has occurred both within the TransApps team, but also through outreach to the community for feedback. Additional industry outreach includes various presentations, some of which are listed below. * Smartphones and Handheld Devices for Defense and Homeland Security, Washington, DC, October 2013 * 3_Lack.ashx+&cd;=87&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=usSecuring Android Mobile Devices for the Tactical User, April 2012 * NIST Mobile Device Security Technical Exchange Meeting, January 2012 * Forthcoming: Mission Command, June 2014 * Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data Working Group, September 2013 * Command and Control Summit, July 2011 * Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security and Applications, April 2013 * International Test and Evaluation Association, Annual Conference, 2013 * Cyber Endeavor: Operations in Cloud and Cellular Networks, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, June 2012 There also is a growing body of literature related to findings and innovations associated with TransApps.

Other Military Mobile-Based Efforts The initial TransApps effort was not without controversy, as it followed the Army‚Äôs ‚ÄúApps for the Army‚Äù initiative.http://www.nextgov.com/defense/whats-brewin/2010/05/army- apps-1-transformative-apps-0/53354/ A fiscal year 2011 National Defense Authorization Act Report (p. 197-98) emphasized its preference for the ‚ÄúApps for Army‚Äù initiative due to the greater proximity of the Army Chief Information Officer to the warfighter‚Äôs operational gaps and needs. The report also expressed concerns about duplication of efforts and the need to deconflict development between the two projects.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt491/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt491.pdf TransApps was one of almost two dozen DoD mobile application efforts in 2011 including systems such as General Dynamic‚Äôs GD 300, the Army‚Äôs Relevant ISR to the Edge (RITE), and The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). Similarly, the Land Warrior project reflects a compilation of 20 years of research and development by the US Army, but was cancelled in 2007, before reinstatement in 2008.http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a555648.pdf Many of the key attributes of the project were identified in 1991, and focused on enhancing situational awareness and a seamless communications network in theater.http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/4215715 The Nett Warrior project is a key part of the next generation functionality of the reinstated Land Warrior effort.For a detailed overview of NettWarrior, see: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a555648.pdf Pegged for development beginning in 2009, Nett Warrior had an estimated total cost of $1,489.6 million. Prior to the scaled back version, the project is estimated to have cost $2 billion for 74,000 sets of equipment according to a 2012 GAO report.http://defensetech.org/2013/03/28/army-eyes-samsung- smartphones/#ixzz2ttzTxWw7 It initially received harsh user feedback, much of which noted the inability to function in limited bandwidth environments, size and weight, and restricted functionality when bandwidth did exist.http://breakingdefense.com/2011/11/armt-troops-slam-new-combat- smartphone/ In FY13, NettWarrior was listed as an Army priority modernization program, and was allocated $150 million.http://www.g8.army.mil/pdf/AEMP2013_lq.pdf The gap between the two projects may be reconciled. According to John Willison, Director, Command, Power and Integration Directorate, U.S. Army RDECOM, the Army, they have brokered a deal to serve as a bridge between the Nett Warrior and the TransApps programs. The Nett Warrior effort relies on radios within the Joint Battle Command Platform, while TransApps maintains an unconstrained architecture and environment with access to secure military radios. He notes that, at some point, the Army will decide which platform to proceed with, but it may not be an either-or scenario.http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120918/C4ISR02/309180005/Interview- John-Willison-Director-Command-Power-Integration-Directorate-U-S-Army-RDECOM- CERDEC Similarly, as a recent study pointed out, there is a need for a holistic approach for the tactical use of mobile technology. For instance, there is a need for the integration of TransApps with the Last Tactical Mile (LG3), as well as to provide direct network access to truly replicate the ‚Äòsmart phone‚Äô experience.https://ronna.apan.org/CAAT/Shared%20Documents/110902_NIU_CAAT_RCS_SNEIL110902_SP_Wireless_to_the_Edge.pdf \\\\---- References Category:DARPA ","title":"TransApps"},{"id":"43680935","text":"Glaucocharis simmondsi is a moth in the family Crambidae.

Hort (Born 10 October 1941) is an Honorary Professor of Science, Technology and Innovation Studies at the University of Edinburgh Ingram served as Master of St. Catharine's College, Cambridge between 2000 and 2007. Early life and education Ingram was born in Birmingham in 1941, the son of a toolmaker and grandson of a gamekeeper. From an early age he had an interest in botany. After graduating from Yardley Grammar School, he apprenticed as a gardener, but soon decided to study botany at a university. He selected the University of Hull because it enabled him to read botany in combination with geology and psychology, other nascent interests of his.

Ideas With emphasis on the need for open content and open knowledge, Cobo has promoted the ideas that education should be a continuous process and flexible to changing needs. He believes there should be a balance between F2F and virtual learning environments and to mix them to complement each other, and has criticized the use of technology in education currently as contradictory and confusing, with too much promotion of products by companies not necessarily focused in improving education. Cobo, argues the challenges of a more open science: \\"we exclude a lot of communities, which might be equally interested in producing science or consuming science, but they may not have the English or the access to journals data bases to do those things. So we have here this kind of tradeoff between this approach of we need to publish open access for everybody but we have this restriction where if people don‚Äôt have the English or the access they cannot be a part of this game.\\" His main contribution to educational theory is the concept of ‚Äúinvisible learning,‚Äù the idea that most of what people learn comes from doing new things, rather than through explicit instruction. He promotes ‚Äúinvisible learning‚Äù not as a theory but as a meta-theory with the aim of incorporating different ideas and perspectives and as a ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù It is highly influenced by the notion and values of open source in the sense that it should be developed collaboratively. The idea is convert the classroom into a laboratory, incubatory or workshop instead of a place for monologues.

One critic commented: ‚ÄúWith packed cinema halls and long lines to get tickets, [Behaviour‚Äôs] exhibition cycle promises to be long and could be of greater impact if the country didn‚Äôt have more of 85% of its cinema halls closed down or destroyed.‚Äù The movie kindled an intense social debate and even the Ministry of Education eventually promoted its discussion in the schools. In several interviews, Daranas stated: ‚ÄúThe educational system is just a pretext [in the film] to talk about issues which are inherent to most official institutions and not just in Cuba. Carmela‚Äôs classroom is a counterpoint to the state of things ‚Äì perhaps a parable of a possible Cuba, a space were differences are respected, where everybody‚Äôs opinion counts and common sense rises above the handlings of bureaucrats and politics.‚Äù Howard Feinstein, from Screen Daily, said: ‚ÄúIn a film that has taken Cuba by storm and is in the midst of a streak of overseas awards, former documentarian Daranas smoothly pulls together dual journeys that might not otherwise intersect so credibly. [‚Ä¶] Reception should be positive, with such pluses as first-rate performances, especially Daranas‚Äôs brilliant work with children, and an inventive script outweighing a few rough technical edges.‚Äù Daniel Grivel, from Cin√©-Feuilles, said: ‚ÄúExcellent in his direction of actors and with a fraternal gaze on his countrymen, Ernesto Daranas makes us the gift of a moving and positive tale.‚Äù Dennis Harvey, in his review for Variety, said: ‚ÄúDaranas‚Äô direction tamps down the script‚Äôs implicit moralizing and melodramatic elements by playing everything in an agreeably low-key, naturalistic tenor.‚Äù Stephen Holden, from The New York Times, said: ‚ÄúThe children, their teachers and their parents represent a lively cross-section of contemporary Cuban society.‚Äù John DeFore, from Hollywood Reporter, commented: ‚ÄúDaranas' screenplay is sufficiently focused on the daily hassles of life in Cuba that uncertainties over the characters' fates rarely loom large enough to feel like plot devices; similarly, none of the performances seems calculated to draw our sympathy away from other characters. [‚Ä¶] Some cast members' performances would look considerably better with just one or two adjustments to reaction shots; and administrative wrangling over Carmela's job goes on long enough that it threatens to throw the film's balance off. If it's uneven, though, the film benefits from its restrained portrayal of the tenderness between Chala and Carmela, who care for each other when family members who should cannot.\\" Awards At the M√°laga Spanish Film Festival, Behavior won the awards in the Latin American section for best film, best director, and best actress (Alina Rodriguez), as well as the audience award in that section.

Civil-service career  Rankin originally joined the Department of Social Welfare (as it was then called) in 1978 as a temporary clerk, following the break-up of her first marriage. Rising through the ranks, she became the head of the Department in 1998. Her time as head of the Department occasioned some controversy, with allegations of extravagant spending and of a management style akin to a personality cult. In 2001 she lost a high-profile Employment Court case after the Labour government decided not to renew her contract. She has since worked as a consultant and public speaker.  Political career  In her 20s Rankin was a member of the Labour Party, serving as the Albany branch secretary. In 2007 she was elected to the Auckland Regional Council, as the representative of the North Shore constituency. She gained appointment as a commissioner of the-then Families Commission in 2009; her term ended in 2013. At the 2010 Auckland local-body elections she stood in the North Shore ward where she finished fourth and was not elected, however she won election to the Upper Harbour Local Board and to the Waitemata District Health Board. She was re-elected to the Health Board and Local Board at the 2013 elections. Rankin joined the board of the Conservative Party of New Zealand in 2012 and became the Party's CEO in 2013. At the 2014 general election she was a candidate for the Conservative Party in the Epsom electorate, and was also ranked second on the Conservative party list. However, the Conservative Party did not achieve the necessary 5% of the party vote to qualify for list seats, so she was not elected. She resigned from the Conservative Party on 23 June 2015 after losing confidence in the founder, Colin Craig. On 7 September 2016, Christine Rankin testified in a defamation lawsuit brought by the New Zealand Taxpayers' Union founder Jordan Williams against the former Party leader Colin Craig. Williams had filed legal action against Craig after the latter claimed that Williams had lied when he said that Craig sexually harassed his press secretary Rachel MacGregor. During the trial, Rankin testified that Craig had disclosed details of his relationship with MacGregor and that this revelation had led her to lose confidence in Craig's leadership of the Conservative Party. Personal life Rankin was raised Catholic, and in 2005 converted to the Soka Gakkai International tradition of Nichiren Buddhism. She has two sons from previous marriages. In 2006 she competed on Dancing with the Stars.

The Leningradsky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the station in the northwest, in particular, with the towns of Khimki, Zelenograd, Solnechnogorsk, Klin, Konakovo, and Tver. The stations the direction serves are located in Moscow, in the towns of Khimki, Solnechnogorsk, and Klin in Moscow Oblast, and in Konakovsky and Kalininsky Districts and the city of Tver of Tver Oblast. The suburban trains have their southeastern terminus at Moscow Leningradsky railway station in Moscow. In the northwestern direction, the suburban trains terminate at Kryukovo, Podsolnechnaya, Klin, Konakovo GRES, and Tver. The line is served by October Railway. This is in contrast to all other suburban directions from Moscow, which are served by Moscow Railway. The suburban railway line follows the Moscow ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway which connects Moscow with Saint Petersburg via Tver and Bologoye. It is electrified everywhere between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. History The railway between Moscow and Saint Petersburg was opened on November 1, 1851 and is the second oldest railway in Russia. In 1950, it was electrified between Moscow and Kryukovo, and in 1953, between Kryukovo and Klin. In 1957, the section between Klin and Kalinin (currently Tver) was electrified. In 1966, a branch to Konakovo was electrified as well. In 1914, a railway connecting Klin and Vysokovsk was open. There was passenger traffic between Klin and Vysokovsk.

His work looks at the darker side of being human, satirizing the human condition while celebrating it at the same time. In 1978, he learned how to etch and to this day continues to make prints. In 1979, he became the bass player for the Chicago new wave band, Bohemia. The band went on to tour the United States playing various sized clubs in 1983 and the first half of 1984. He wrote many of Bohemia's more notable songs on their five vinyl releases, including \\"Automatic Mind,\\" \\"Empty Room,\\" \\"No Ordinary Moon,\\" and \\"Love Turns to Stone.\\" The Beatles, The Doors and Chicago blues had a big impact on his writing style. For instance, \\"Love Turns to Stone,\\" is based on only one chord. After Bohemia broke up in mid 1984, Zirbel waited a year and in 1985 started his own label, Pteranodon Ltd. Editions, and began releasing his own material over the next decades, including \\"Anatomy of a Pig,\\" (cassette), \\"Skull Tracks,\\" (CD - EP), \\"Two-Headed Fly\\" (CD with two EPs), and \\"Live at the Big Horse Lounge\\" (CD - EP). Several Chicago blues and jazz musicians appeared on his \\"Skull Tracks\\" CD, including Sunnyland Slim, Carey Bell, Barrett Deems, and Howard Levy. Since the early 1970s he has produced and directed several short films and rock videos. He often did his own camera work and editing. Gene Siskel took notice of his film, \\"Duck Eggs and the Miniature Rooster,\\" and interviewed Zirbel live during the first showing of the film on Night Watch in 1977 (name soon changed to Image Union) on Chicago's PBS channel. His film \\"She-Wolf\\" was shown at the Chicago Underground Film Festival in 2000 and at the Stuttgart Film Festival in 2001. Zirbel's most recent movie, \\"Reptilian Calculations,\\" received its world premier at the Paris Short Film Festival in May 2018. It's the fifth episode from the 46 minute compilation, \\"Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy.\\" His drawings on found paper may be one of his most noted series along with the \\"Asylum\\" drawings which he did while working at a mental hospital in the mid 1970s. In 1985, he went on a trip to New York to promote his music and art. The first East Village gallery he approached, Eastman Wahmendorf, placed him in a show and subsequently others. In late November 1986 with the promptings of his gallery, he moved to New York and took up residence at the Times Square Motor Hotel where he resided until moving back to Chicago in mid-1987. Zirbel has forty years of print making experience. In 2018, he was invited to exhibit multiple states of his etchings at the Jinling Art Museum, in Nanjing, China. In addition to creating etchings, Zirbel paints, draws and sculpts. Life Frank Joseph Zirbel was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1947. In 1970, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a bachelor of arts degree in Philosophy. His first group show dates back to 1973 at Edgewood Orchard Gallery in Door County, Wisconsin. More than 70 group and several one- man shows have followed. Since 1977, he has made Chicago his home base. Zirbel moved to New York in November, 1986 (upon encouragement by his East Village N.Y. art dealer, Joseph Sipos ‚Äì Helio Gallery).Chattanooga Free Press, 11/22/1998 In New York, he resided in the Times Square Hotel, 255 W.43rd St. While in New York he struck up a friendship with the N.Y. artist Chaim Koppleman who let him start using his Soho etching studio as a place to work. In mid-summer 1987, Zirbel returned to Chicago. Work Zirbel‚Äôs art uses representational imagery within the stylistic modes of figurative expressionism and classical surrealism.Sherman, Mary CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, Title: \\"Zirbel's works examine female form\\", July 15, 1988, Page 17 He started drawing as a child and is primarily self-taught. His first etchings date to 1978. He started showing art in New York‚Äôs East Village in 1985 and for many years thereafter, with twelve N.Y. shows in the late 1980s. Also, Zirbel started oil painting and working in color during this time period, encouraged to do so by his New York dealer who invited him to be in a 1986 exhibition of paintings. Zirbel has claimed that his initial drawing style came together in the second half of the 1970s while he was working the midnight shift in admissions at the Elgin Mental Health Center, Elgin, Illinois. Here, having previously worked on all the various wards, and with extra time on his hands between admissions, he created unique black-and-white ink drawings inspired by the psychotic and the insane.New City, June 6, 1991 During his employ at the hospital, Zirbel also made a 16mm documentary film titled \\"Duck Eggs and the Miniature Rooster\\" containing an interview with Hermine Pakrovsky, one of the hospital's revolving-door patients. The film made its television debut on Chicago's local PBS affiliate in 1977. Zirbel's dark novel \\"The Idiot's Grasp\\" was inspired by his work at the hospital. The novel is now housed in the Museum of Modern Art's artists book collection. In late 1998, Chattanooga, Tennessee art dealer Angela Usrey discovered these works and consigned a few, awarding Zirbel a show at her gallery. In January, 1999, she exhibited these works at New York‚Äôs Outsider Art Fair. Usrey named them the \\"Asylum Drawings.\\" Her Tanner Hill Gallery continued exhibiting this series at the N.Y. Outsider art fair through 2012. Zirbel often has worked in series-related art. One such series, \\"The Messenger Street Drawing Series\\" (early 1990s) was inspired by the urban images he saw while working as a bicycle messenger in Chicago. In November 1995, a month after Zirbel quit being a messenger, the Chicago photographer, Mark Debernardi, did a raw video interview with him in his studio reflecting on Zirbel's five year stint on the street. Included in the piece are some works from the messenger drawing series itself. A 1997 exhibition of these drawings at the Judith Racht Gallery, Chicago, garnered Zirbel Chicago Magazine‚Äôs selection as Chicago‚Äôs best undiscovered artist for that year.Chicago Magazine, Best of Issue, Title/Category \\"Best Undiscovered Artist\\", December, 1997, Page 86. Another set of works revolving around a single theme, Zirbel's \\"Influencing Artists Series\\", expanded into etchings, paintings, collage and assemblage and explores the faces and personalities of those who inspired him. In 2005, Susan Aurinko‚Äôs Flatfile Galleries, Chicago, presented a surrealist show featuring several paintings from this series, including portraits of Luis Bunuel, Rene Magritte, and an extensive etching series on Edgar Allan Poe. In late 2015, The Art Center - Highland Park invited Zirbel to exhibit many of his found object sculptures in a group show. 2016 witnessed a drawing of his being chosen for the Williams College Museum of Art's Walls Collection, in Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 2017, two portraits of Nelson Algren by Zirbel (a painting/collage and a monotype) were purchased by collectors and loaned to the Nelson Algren Museum of Miller Beach, Gary, Ind. for an indefinite time period. On YouTube, Zirbel's many films and videos can be seen on his film channel, Frank Joseph Zirbel. Recent additions include two films, \\"The Human Riddle,\\" and \\"The Mask and the Mirror,\\" from the compilation, \\"Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy,\\" based on drawings he did after Pieter Bruegel's \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" engravings. This set of seven drawings is titled, \\"Quicksand and Quagmire.\\" The film is an American/German co-production with animation and camera work completed in Munich by Mike Hans Steffl. In 2018, \\"Reptilian Calculations,\\" the fifth episode of \\"Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy,\\" premiered on May 9 at the Paris Short Film Festival. The film was also selected for showing during Poland's all summer out door film festival, On Art - Poland, based out of Warsaw, Poland. In August, it received an Honorable Mention at the Los Angeles Experimental Forum Festival and then was chosen for exhibition in late November at the Directors Circle Festival of Shorts, in Erie, Pennsylvania.

(2009) Waves and vibrations in soils: earthquakes, traffic, shocks, construction works, IUSS Press, Pavia, Italy, 499p. The surface ground motion may be strongly amplified if the geological conditions are unfavorable (e.g. sediments). Therefore, the study of local site effects is an important part of the assessment of strong ground motions, seismic hazard and engineering seismology in general. Damage due to an earthquake may thus be aggravated as in the case of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. For alluvial basins, we may shake a bowl of jelly to model the phenomenon at a small scale. This article defines site effects first, presents the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, describes the theoretical analysis of the phenomenon (through mechanical waves) and details several research results on seismic site effects in Caracas.  Definition of the phenomenon  thumbFig.1 : Seismic site effects / wave amplification in a horizontal layer (SH-waves): various wavefields. When propagating, the seismic waves are reflected and refracted at the interface between the various geological layers (Fig.1). The example of Figure 1 depicts the seismic wave amplification in horizontal geological layers. We consider a homogeneous elastic half-space (in green) over which an elastic alluvial layer of constant thickness h is located (in gray). A shear wave (SH) of amplitude A_2 reaches the interface between the half-space and the alluvial layer with an incidence \\\\theta_2. It thus generates: * a reflected wave in the half-space with amplitude A_2^' and incidence \\\\theta_2 * a refracted wave in the superficial layer with amplitude A_1 and incidence \\\\theta_1 The refracted wave originates a reflected wave when reaching the free surface; its amplitude and incidence are denoted A_1^' and \\\\theta_1 respectively. This latter wave will be reflected and refracted several times at the base and the top of the surficial layer. If the layer is softer than the half-space, the surface motion amplitude can be larger than A_2 thus leading to the amplification of seismic waves or seismic site effects. When the geological interfaces are not horizontal, it also possible to study seismic site effects by considering the basin effects due to the complex geometry of the alluvial fillingBard P.Y., Bouchon M. (1985). The two dimensional resonance of sediment filled valleys, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 75, pp.519-541. For small inclinations of the subsurface layers and/or low impedance contrasts, the assumption of horizontal layering (i.e. the 1D assumption) can still be used to predict site response. In this article, we propose several examples of seismic site effects (observed or simulated during large earthquakes) as well as a theoretical analysis of the amplification phenomenon.  Example: site effects in Mexico City (1985)  Fig.2 : Site effects in Mexico city: recordings from the 1985 earthquake Seismic site effects have been first evidenced during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.Singh S.K., Mena E., Castro R. (1988) Some aspects of source characteristics of the 19 September 1985 Michoacan earthquake and ground motion amplification in and near Mexico City from strong motion data, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 78(2), pp.451-477. The earthquake epicenter was located along the Pacific Coast (several hundreds kilometers from Mexico-City), the seismic shaking was however extremely strong leading to very large damages. Figure 2 displays the recordings performed at different distances from the epicenter during the earthquake sequence. The acceleration amplitude measured at different distances changes drastically: * Campos station: this station is located very close to the epicenter and recorded a maximum acceleration of 150~cm/s^2, * Teacalco station: this station is located at more than 200 km from the epicenter and recorded a much lower acceleration (about 18~cm/s^2). This amplitude decay is due to the wave attenuation during Figure 2a: The effect of the resonance: the natural frequency of the upper geological bed of the modern area of Mexico City (SCT) is 0.5Hz (period of 2 seconds), that's why the PGA reached its maximum amplitude at the same period. The lower curve is the UNAM spectral accelerations. the propagation process: geometrical attenuation due to the expansion of the wavefront and material (or intrinsic) attenuation due to the energy dissipation within the medium (e.g. grains friction), * UNAM station: this station is located at more than 300 km from the epicenter and recorded a maximum acceleration of 35~cm/s^2, larger than that recorded at the Teacalco station, * SCT station: this station is located in Mexico City at approximately 400 km from the epicenter and recorded a very strong maximum acceleration (about 170~cm/s^2). We may notice that the acceleration amplitude strongly decreases first and then increases when the seismic waves reach the alluvial deposit on which Mexico City has been founded. Figure 2a: Shows the effect of resonance: The thickness of the upper geological bed of the modern area of Mexico City is 40 m. The velocity of the shear waves through that layer is 80 m/sec.Tiedemann, H., 1992. Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions. S.R.C., 951p. It means that the natural frequency of that formation is 0.5Hz (period of 2 seconds) Beresnev et al., 1998. Magnitude of Nonlinear Sediment Response in L.A. Basin During the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. B.S.S.A., 88: pp. 1079-1084. When the shear waves of the same frequency arrived to that area, the resonance was responsible for that huge seismic site effect.  Theoretical analysis of seismic site effects: horizontal layering  In case of horizontal soil layering (constant thickness, cf Fig.1), we may analyze seismic site effects theoretically. One considers a shear wave (SH) (i.e. polarized perpendicularly to the figure) reflected and refracted wave at the interface between both media and reflected at the free surface. Considering Fig.1, we may analyze the propagation of the various waves in the sedimentary layer (i=1) and in the half-space (i=2). Assuming both media as linear elastic and writing the continuity conditions at the interface (displacement and traction) as well as the free surface conditions, we may determine the spectral ratio \\\\bar{T}(\\\\omega) between the surface motion and the motion at the top of the half-space without any sedimentary layer: \\\\bar{T}(\\\\omega)=\\\\frac{2A_1}{2A_2}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos k_{z_1}h+i\\\\bar{\\\\chi}\\\\sin k_{z_1}h} where k_{z_1}=\\\\frac{\\\\omega \\\\theta_i}{V_{S_i}} ; \\\\bar{\\\\chi}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_1\\\\rho_1}{\\\\mu_2\\\\rho_2}}\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta_1}{\\\\cos\\\\theta_2} and : * h is the layer thickness, * \\\\theta_i is the wave incidence in layer i, * \\\\rho_i is the mass density in layer i, * \\\\mu_i is the shear modulus in layer i, * k_{z_1} is the vertical wave number in layer 1, * V_{S_i}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_i}{\\\\rho_i}} is the shear wave velocity. Fig. 3: Seismic site effects in a single sedimentary layer (SH waves): spectral ratio for various layer/bedrock velocity ratios Fig.3 displays the variations of the spectral ratio \\\\bar{T} with respect to frequency for different mechanical features of the half-space (with V_{S_1}=200~m/s for the sedimentary layer). We notice that the motion amplification may be very strong at certain frequencies. The amplification level depends on the velocity contrast \\\\bar{\\\\chi} and takes the following maximum values: * \\\\bar{T}_{max}=2 for V_{S_2}=800~m/s (blue curve), * \\\\bar{T}_{max}\\\\simeq 3.5 for V_{S_2}=2000~m/s (green curve), * \\\\bar{T}_{max}\\\\simeq 6 for V_{S_2}=5000~m/s (yellow curve). The red curve corresponds to a large velocity contrast between the layer and the half-space (\\\\bar{\\\\chi}\\\\gg 1); the amplification is thus very large. As displayed in Fig.3, the maximum amplification is reached at certain frequencies corresponding to the resonance of the sedimentary layer. The fundamental frequency of the layer (or 1st resonance frequency) may be easily calculated under the form: f_0=\\\\frac{V_{S_1}}{4h}. The fundamental mode thus corresponds to a quarter wavelength resonance. The \\"quarter wavelength\\" approach can be used to estimate site amplifications due to the impedance contrast. When the sedimentary layers are not horizontal (e.g. sedimentary basin), the analysis is more complex since surface waves generated by the lateral heterogeneities (e.g. basin edges) should be accounted for. In such cases, it is possible to perform empirical studies but also theoretical analyses for simple geometriesS√°nchez-Sesma F.J. (1983). Diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional surface irregularities, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 73(6), pp.1621-1636. or numerical simulations for more complex cases.  Seismic site effects in sedimentary basins: the case of Caracas  thumbFig.4: Seismic site effects in Caracas (BEM simulations in the frequency domain). In sedimentary basins, site effects also lead to the generation of surface waves at the basin edges. This phenomenon may significantly strengthen the amplification of the seismic motion. The aggravation of the amplification level when compared to the case of horizontal layering may be up to a factor of 5 or 10. It depends on the velocity contrast between the layers and the geometry of the basin. Such phenomena are named basin effects and we may consider the analogy with the vibrations in a bowl of jelly. The theoretical analysis of site effects in canyons or semi-circular sedimentary basins has been performed through semi- analytical methods in the early 80's. Recent numerical simulations allowed the analysis of site effects in ellipsoidal sedimentary basins. Depending on the basin geometry, the aggravation of site effects is different from that of the horizontally layered case. When the mechanical properties of the sedimentary basin are known, we may simulate site effects numerically. Figure 4 depicts the amplification phenomenon for the city of Caracas.Duval A.M., M√©neroud J.P., Vidal S., Bard P.Y. (1998).

Each color map displays the amplification level A_0 at a given frequency f_0 : * top: f_0=0.3Hz ~;~ A_0=2.53. Site effects due to the topography clearly occur at the top of the hill (right). Nevertheless, site effects due to the sedimentary basin lead to a larger amplification. * middle: f_0=0.4Hz ~;~ A_0=8.83. Topographical site effects are negligible when compared to that due to the basin (4 times larger than at 0.3 Hz). * bottom: f_0=0.6Hz ~;~ A_0=7.11. Site effects in the basin are of the same order than at 0.4 Hz but we notice a much shorter wavelength. Numerous geological sites have been investigated by various researchers for weak earthquakes as well as for strong ones (cf synthesis). In the latter case, it is necessary to account for the nonlinear behavior of the soil under large loading or even the soil liquefaction which may lead to the soil failure.

Known as the last great Oirat hero, Amursana was the last of the Dzungar rulers. The defeat of his rebel forces by Qing dynasty Chinese armies in the late 1750s signaled the final extinction of Mongol influence and power in Inner Asia, ensured the incorporation of Mongol territory into the Qing Chinese Empire, and brought about the Dzungar genocide, the Qing Emperor's \\"final solution\\" to China's northwest frontier problems.  Family  Amursana was born in 1723 to a noble mother from the Dzungar-Oirat tribe and taisha or crown prince of the Khoit-Oirat clan. Amursana's mother, Boitalak () was the daughter of Tsewang Rabtan, leader of the Dzungar-Oriat tribe following the death of Galdan Boshugtu Khan. She first married Danjung (), the eldest son of Lha-bzang Khan, ruler of the Khoshut- Oirats tribe. Following Danjung's death c. 1717, allegedly at the hands of his father-in-law, Boitalak married Amursana's father, a taisha or crown prince of the Khoit-Oirat clan.  Alliance and split with Dawachi  Dawachi in Chinese full dress The Khoits ranked lower within the Oirat tribal hierarchy their taishi answered to the Dorbet Oirats and by the time Amursana became khan, the power of the Dzungars was on the wane. The death of Tsewang Rabtan's son Galdan Tseren and the succession of Tsewang Dorji Namjal in 1745 led to a fierce internecine struggle for Dzungar leadership. Tsewang Dorji was subsequently blinded and imprisoned in Aksu by his elder brother Lama Dorji (; d. 1752), who then usurped the khanship. Although a Khoit, Lama Dorji's only opposition came from the Dzungar Khan, Dawachi, grandson of Khong Tayiji Tsewang Rabtan's cousin Tsering Dhondup (). In 1751, Lama Dorji defeated Dawachi who was forced to flee across the border into Kazakh Khanate territory with about a dozen men. Amursana was one of Dawachi's few followers who returned to Tarbagatai to join up with his Khoit clansmen. With a thousand of his men, he then marched to Ili where they surprised Lama Dorji and killed him on 13January 1752. Other sources claim that Lama Dorji was killed by his own troops in December 1752. Dawachi then assumed the title 'of 'taisha of the Dzungars and richly rewarded Amursana for his efforts. As a Khoit, Amursana did not rank as part of the Dzungar Khanate's hierarchy and relied on Dawachi for influence among the various Oirat clans. Nevertheless, marriage to the daughter of Ablai Khan, leader of the neighboring Kazakh Khanate, and alliances with various Oirat clan leaders enabled him to build up enough support to call on Dawachi to divide the Khanate's lands between them. Dawachi refused and instead attacked his former ally, forcing him to flee east to Khovd. There, Amursana swore allegiance to the Qing Qianlong Emperor, bringing with him 5,000 soldiers and 20,000 women and children. He then traveled to Beijing to seek the emperor's assistance in defeating Dawachi and retaking Ili and neighboring Kashgar. Amursana's persuaded the ambitious and glory-seeking Qianlong to back his plan, in addition to granting him a princedom of the first degree (), which entitled Amursana to double stipends and privileges, as a bonus. Meanwhile, most of the Oirat Khoshut had also defected to the Qing leaving Dawachireportedly a \\"drunken and incompetent\\" rulerwith only the Dzungars under his control.  Capture of Ili  Ili Late in 1754, in an attempt to definitively settle the 60-year-old Dzungaria problem, Qianlong gave orders for a final advance on Ili. Amursana was made of the Northern Route Army. General took command of the army, which set out from Uliastai in March 1755 and linked up with the Western Route Army under and Salar () three months later. The combined forces reached Bortala, in June 1755. Qing forces captured Ili without a fight and Dawachi withdrew south-west to the Gedeng Mountains where he made a last stand with his 10,000 men. Dawachi's army was routed and he was captured and dispatched to Beijing. Amursana had hoped to usurp Dawachi's position as head of the Dzungars but Qianlong had already pre- empted such a move. Before the expedition to Ili had set out and fearing the rise of a new Mongolian empire, Qianlong had proclaimed that the four Oirat clans of Dzungaria would be resettled in their own territory each with their own Khan appointed directly by Beijing. Amursana spurned the offer of Khan over the Khoits and demanded to be khan of all Oirats. Amursana was instructed to return to Beijing but sensing danger, he escaped from his escort en route to the Qing imperial resort of Chengde on 24September 1755.  Revolt against the Qing  Qing general Zhao Hui attacks Amursana's forces in a night battle in present-day Wusu, Xinjiang Amursana rallied the majority of the remaining Oirats and launched his rebellion against the Qing. The Chinese armies had by now withdrawn leaving behind only a skeleton force under Ban Di. Helpless and unable to do anything, Ban Di committed suicide on 4October 1755. For the following eight months, Amursana was the sole leader of the Oirats and the de facto Dzungar Khan. Meanwhile, as he had promised, Qianlong appointed Khans for each of the four Oirat clans in a move designed to prevent them joining the rebellion. Qing troops were once more dispatched in late March, 1756 retook Ili. Amursana escaped and fled to the Kazakh Khanate where his father- in-law, Ablai Khan, refused to hand him over, despite the threat of a Qing invasion of his territory. Qianlong railed at his generals for their failure to capture the fugitive, saying they were a waste of time and money. He dismissed them and ordered the withdrawal of all troops then appointed commander of a small expeditionary force that was sent to garrison Ili. Amursana returned to Ili to rally the insurgents and almost annihilated Zhao Hui's forces. The hopelessly outnumbered Chinese general, despite putting up a spirited defence, was forced to retreat with 500 soldiers. The rebels cut the post routes to the capital but Zhao Hui managed to fight his way back to Barkul, where he pleaded with Qianlong to take more drastic measures against the rebels. Meanwhile, Qing attention became temporarily focused on the Khalka prince Ching√ºnjav, a descendant of Genghis Khan, who between the summer of 1756 and January 1757 mounted the most serious Khalka Mongol rebellion against the Qing until its demise in 1911. Before dealing with Amursana, the majority of Qianlong's forces were reassigned to ensure stability in Khalka until Ching√ºnjav's army was crushed by the Qing in a ferocious battle near Lake Kh√∂vsg√∂l in January, 1757. After the victory, Qianlong dispatched additional forces to Ili where they quickly routed the rebels. Amursana escaped for a third time to the Kazakh Khanate, but not long afterwards Ablai Khan pledged tributary status to the Chinese, which meant Amursana was no longer safe.  Death and aftermath  Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor Amursana fled west to Siberia and sought asylum from the Russians at their fortress in Semipalatinsk (modern Semey, Kazakhstan). He was then taken to Tobolsk where he died of smallpox on 21September 1757, aged 35. The Chinese demanded the return of the fugitive and his followers under the terms of Article X to the Treaty of Kiakhta, but the Russians hid the facts behind his flight and death hoping to gain leverage through the possession of his body. After Qing envoys were told that Amursana had died crossing the Irtysh River, they spent the next month dredging it but found nothing. After a long period of wrangling, the Russians finally agreed to ship Amursana's frozen body from Tobolsk to Kiakhta for viewing but refused a request that it be handed over for \\"posthumous punishment\\"; they instead buried it. Repeated Qing requests to St. Petersburg for the return of Amursana's corpse were rebutted by the Russians on the grounds that their amicable relations should not be upset by \\"a few rotten bones\\". Qianlong piled on the pressure: he placed Russian Orthodox monks in Beijing under house arrest and threatened to cut off trade altogether. In the end, Amursana's body was not returned. Qianlong's insistence that \\"The state only needs to capture Amursana. When he has died, and his body is retrieved, the entire [D]zungar affair can be called a success\\", failed to convince the Russians to return the body. Qianlong's obsession with the matter appears to have been influenced by his grandfather Kangxi's treatment of the body of his arch-enemy Galdan Boshugtu Khan, whose head was placed on public display and his ashes crushed on the military parade ground in the Chinese capital. On 18October 1768, both parties signed an amendment to Article X of the Treaty of Kiakhta in the Russian, Manchu and Mongol languages prescribing punishments that would apply to future criminals, including defectors. However, as the border with Dzungaria had not been defined at the time of the original 1727 treaty, Amursana and his compatriots did not qualify.  Legacy  Ja Lama who claimed to be the reincarnation of Amursana Amursana's revolt and the subsequent subjugation of the Oirats led to the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas (1757-1759) south of the Tian Shan range and the final Qing conquest of the Tarim Basin. The abortive rebellion also dealt the death blow to Dzungaria and the Dzungar people. Ja Lama (1862‚Äì1922), who fought successive campaigns against Chinese rule in western Mongolia between 1890-1922, at first claimed to be the grandson and later the reincarnation of Amursana. He was also the inspiration behind the Ak Jang new religious movement.

He was, successively, Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to the Cavalry Corps and then to X Corps. In October 1915 he was posted as BGGS to the British Salonika Army, before appointment as BGGS and second-in-command to II Corps, forming part of the Fifth Army at the Battle of Somme in 1916. Howell was killed in action at Authuille by shrapnel on 7 October 1916, after making a personal reconnaissance of the frontline near Thiepval during the later Somme offensives. Howell had been in action on the front line since the outbreak of the war, serving with the British Expeditionary Force, and commanding the 4th Queen's Own Hussars through the retreat from Mons, the Battle of Le Cateau, the Marne offensive, Hill 60, and the First Battle of Ypres. He was mentioned in despatches six times, and made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1915 for \\"meritorious service\\". Howell came from a military family. After education at Lancing College and passing out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst with honours, he joined the elite Queen's Own Corps of Guides as a subaltern in 1900. His abilities were recognised by Major General Douglas Haig, when Inspector-General of Cavalry, India. Haig made him his brigade major at the young age of 25. This was the start of a lifelong friendship between Haig and Howell. Howell's interests were more extensive than soldiering, and he travelled extensively throughout the Balkan region, becoming a correspondent for The Times and an expert on the local politics of the Near East. This experience and a formidable intellect led to his becoming a senior instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. He had himself attended the Staff College, Quetta, in India in 1903‚Äì04. It was expected, even amongst the highest military circles, that had Howell not been killed in action he would have reached the highest command in the British Army. This was certainly the view of many of his contemporaries and peers. At the age of 37, he was gazetted as brigadier general in September 1915 and, rather than holding \\"temporary\\" rank, was the youngest fully promoted general officer in the British Army during the First World War. Of military significance was his direct role in the strategic planning of the later conclusive actions of the Somme Offensive; the successful battles of Thiepval Ridge and Ancre Heights. These used more sophisticated planned attacks using techniques such as synchronised barrages, the use of a limited number of tanks and proper briefing of field commanders. Lieutenant General Sir Claud Jacob, is quoted as saying that much of what his II Corps achieved during the Somme was owed to Howell's efforts, and in fact he had left much of the daily command to Howell, who was a man of exceptional capability. Early life Philip Howell was born in England on 7 December 1877, the second son of Lieutenant Colonel Horace Howell, late the Punjab Frontier Force, and Ella Howell, from Shepshed, Leicestershire. Between the age of six and ten Howell, and his family, joined his father in India and Kashmir, living in places such as Kohat, Murree, and Dera Ismail Khan. He returned to England for schooling in 1887, at Miss Gilzean's school in Clifton, and for two years as a day-boy at Shrewsbury House Preparatory School, Surbiton (his paternal grandfather, John Howell lived in Surrey.) Following this he went to Lancing College from January 1891, joining the fourth form under R.D. Budworth and attended until December 1896. His mother had died prematurely from a long illness in August 1889. Shortly after, his father had retired to Brighton, after a long service in the Indian Army. Sandhurst and early military career Howell attended the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, passing out with honours (first in fencing, second in riding), and was commissioned second lieutenant on the unattached list of the Indian Army on 4 August 1897. He then served as a subaltern in his father's former regiment, the 5th Punjab Cavalry, in India, from 1898 to 1900. He was promoted lieutenant on 4 November 1899, and transferred in June 1900 to the Queen's Own Corps of Guides (\\"Lumsden's Horse\\") ‚Äì an elite cavalry unit of the Punjab Frontier Force which at the time operated entirely in the North- West Frontier. Howell blended well with this environment. He was a natural with the native troops, taking the trouble to know their language and culture, and respected by them for his professionalism as a soldier. He equally gained the confidence of the local Pathan tribesmen, of whom he had a natural curiosity and talent for dialogue. He had an inherent instinct for exploring different views and cultures, born out of an engaging charm, as well as an instinct for both understanding and treating all on an equal footing ‚Äì but still able to retain his own authority. These unusual qualities remained with him throughout his career. In 1902 the Corps of Guides won the Cavalry Reconnaissance Competition, in which Howell was the patrol commander. During his time as a cavalry subaltern, Howell developed through regimental life a deep love of polo, although a contemporary was later to write that his interest in training and love for his polo ponies exceeded his skill on the playing field. The same officer, Brigadier General Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies, also described him as a fine horseman who could \\"tent peg or pickup a handkerchief off the ground on a big horse barebacked at the gallop\\". An insight into his character was a description by another contemporary that he used to ride out often with two or three polo ponies following him loose, like dogs, much to the consternation of the various ladies with whom he had tea, and whose gardens the ponies devastated. He had a lifelong love of animals, and \\"adored mischief in animals, as he did children\\". In December 1903 Howell's military professionalism was recognised when Major General Douglas Haig, who had just been appointed Inspector-General of Cavalry, India spotted some manoeuvres performed by Howell during an exercise. Haig selected Howell, then twenty-five years old, as his brigade major during further field exercises held in India and up to 1905. This was the start of a lifelong friendship and correspondence between Howell and Haig. Ever loyal, Howell never deflected from his support for Haig in his enterprise during the First World War, whom he perceived to be the best man for the job and infinitely better suited to lead than most of the contemporary generals of the time. However, although one of Haig's champions he was also able to criticise. Pre-war career Howell had also begun to use his leave for travel, extensively in the Balkan region since 1903. He became a special correspondent for The Times, sending in contributions to Charles Moberly Bell, the editor. In its obituary of 14 October 1914, The Spectator mentions Howell's correspondence with The Times during the Macedonian Uprising of 1903, in which his letters \\"brushed\\" with those of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour on the \\"balance of criminality\\", and describes these as \\"admirably written and illuminating\\". This set the form for later Balkan and Near East exploits, and he became a leading expert on the military and political affairs of the region. Howell was promoted captain in August 1906, and was given the job of Intelligence Officer (as Staff Captain) for the North West Frontier region, where his intuitive knowledge of local Pathan politics played their part. On his own initiative he set up a network of \\"spies\\" in the local villages extending across to Turkestan and Kashgar, as resembling characters from Rudyard Kipling's contemporary novel,\\"Kim\\". In 1909, Howell was brigade major to Major General Sir Malcolm Grover in India. Between 1909 and 1911 Howell served as a GSO3 staff officer to the Inspector-General of Cavalry, British Army (Major General Edmund Allenby) at the War Office in London, with frequent intermittent visits to the Balkans, as special correspondent with The Times. The latter brought him into contact with notable figures and other journalists in the region, including James Bourchier and Compton Mackenzie. Shortly before this, in 1908, Howell first met his future wife, Rosalind Upcher Buxton, at her family home at Fritton Hall, Lowestoft, Norfolk. She was a member of the notable slave trade abolitionist Buxton family (also known for banking and brewing), and had travelled extensively in Turkey and the Levant. The mutual interest in Near Eastern affairs and culture drew them together, and led to marriage on 11 September 1911. In December 1911, Howell was appointed by Major General William Robertson as a Senior Instructor at the Staff College, Camberley with the additional title of \\"Professor of Military Studies\\". In the Christmas vacation of 1912, Howell was sent to Thrace, both by The Times (as special correspondent) and the War Office as \\" military observer\\" attached to the Bulgarian Army of General Savov during the First Balkan War. His observations, which included an early favourable assessment of the capabilities of the Bulgarian Army, were turned into a series of military lectures for the Staff College, and published as a book,\\"Campaign in Thrace ‚Äì 1912\\". On 31 August 1913 Howell was promoted major in the 4th Hussars, as second-in-command, then based at The Curragh in Ireland. It was during the Curragh Incident of March 1914, propagated by the forthcoming Home Rule Bill and some confusion amongst high command, that Howell's writing skills and diplomatic abilities came to the fore. The question was posed to officers serving in Ireland (individually) whether they would resign their commissions if asked to march on Ulster ‚Äì where Carson proposed resisting the Home Rule Bill. Almost all the officers, offered to resign their commissions, creating an internal crisis. Howell drafted a letter to the Army Council, on behalf of the officers, and its brigade commander, Hubert Gough. The content of the letter helped diffuse the issue. His efforts were further extended by his writing a personal letter to The Times in which he denounced the fact that soldiers had been asked to choose between their own political conscience and their duty to serve, in an impossible ultimatum. He posed the question that there had been a deliberate effort by the politicians to pass off the decision on to the Army. The letter was signed \\"A Soldier Serving in Ireland\\". Both these efforts contributed in some small way to common sense being applied and the order being rescinded. British Expeditionary Force At the outbreak of war with Germany in 1914, the 4th Hussars was mobilised as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) making its way to Dublin for embarkation to France. The regiment travelled with its horses aboard the SS Atlantian, arriving in Le Havre on 15 August 1914. The 4th Hussars formed part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Hubert Gough, and quickly became embroiled in the Battle and subsequent Retreat from Mons. During these actions the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Hogg, died from wounds received in a rearguard action on 1 September. Howell assumed command of the 4th Hussars through the Battle of Le Cateau, until relieved by the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bridges on 27 September. However, Bridges appointment lasted three days, before he was promoted brigadier general and sent to become chief military adviser to the King of Belgium. Howell resumed command of the 4th Hussars, being promoted lieutenant colonel on 18 October. He led the 4th Hussars throughout the remainder of the advance of First Battle of Marne, and then in the following ten months through the frontline carnage of the First Battle of Ypres, Hill 60, and Neuve Chappelle. Howell was respected by his men as a gallant and able regimental commander, and these were quoted as saying that \\"if the Colonel was there, everything was alright.\\" On one occasion during the battle of Ypres, when his regiment were ordered to take a tactically useless obstacle (a stable block) that had been retaken several times at considerable human cost, Howell was able to countermand on the pretext that as the order was being made the telephone line had been cut. Afterward he stated that \\"a deaf ear at the telephone may be as useful as a blind eye at the telescope\\". He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in February 1915 for \\"meritorious service during the war\\" and had by this stage of the war been mentioned in despatches no less than four times. Staff appointments during the war In March 1915 Howell was appointed Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to the Cavalry Corps under Lieutenant General Edmund Allenby. His promotion to brigadier general was approved and gazetted in September 1915. He was 37 years old. Both Allenby and Howell were quick to point out that cavalry largely became ineffective in trench warfare impeding much of the point of a Cavalry Corps, although this view was not as pessimistic as some observed at the time. It was simply a reality of trench warfare and way the war was now being conducted. In July 1915 the Cavalry Corps was broken up into its former divisional and brigade structure (redistributed as dismounted battalions to support the infantry in the trenches, although in 1916 it was reinstated). Howell was transferred to the more active role of Chief of Staff of X Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Thomas Morland. Howell approved of Morland, who he perceived to be one of the youngest Corps commanders and therefore more receptive to new more practical ideas. However, Howell's time with X Corps on the Western Front was short lived, as matters developed on a wider geographical scale. The Dardanelles Campaign had been launched in April 1915. Once this had failed in its early objective of surprise, and the British (more particularly the Anzac and Indian forces) began to count the heavy cost, Howell was amongst the earliest voices calling for withdrawal ‚Äì but this was largely dissipated amongst those wanting to save face and prolong the campaign. On leave in London, Howell dined on one occasion with Winston Churchill ‚Äì an interesting confrontation of minds, as both were of a similar age and had both served with the 4th Hussars, although at different times. The Dardanelles featured much in the dialogue, and Churchill remonstrated with Howell not to be too harsh about a project that he (Churchill) referred to as \\"his child\\". Politically, moves had been started to launch a Balkan campaign via the port of Salonica. This was a motion largely promoted by the French. Howell could see no logic to a widened Balkan expedition unless Bulgaria was brought either on to the side of the allies or persuaded to remain neutral thereby allowing allied forces to pass through their territory unimpeded to attack the Central flanks ‚Äì using the promise of territorial gain. He knew and appreciated from direct experience that Bulgaria had a better equipped and trained army than neighbouring forces, especially those of a depleted Serbia or an indisciplined military \\"rabble\\" from within a Greece split between a pro-German monarchy and nationalist government loyalists. Encouraged by higher command to take up an appointment in the region because of his expert knowledge, Howell was wary of a Balkan enterprise, partly that because of a lack of allied initiative, the Bulgarians were persuaded to side with German ambitions. Later his earlier views on Bulgaria were deliberately taken out of context (and timing), but these \\"pro-Bulgar\\" opinions were largely based on finding the best practical solution for this sector of the First War. He himself said \\"take away Bulgaria and the whole German pack of cards falls to pieces\\", referring to German ambitions in the Near East, but also in a wider context. Salonica campaign Because of his expert pre-war knowledge of the Balkans, Howell was a natural choice to be sent to assist in the gathering momentum for a Salonica Campaign. A significant part of this momentum stemmed from the French. With the defection of Bulgaria to the German cause, this pace quickly increased. In October 1915, Howell was sent to Salonica as BGGS to XII Corps under General Wilson. However, as matters progressed towards a Balkan offensive the British Salonica Army was created by merging XII Corps with an additional Corps, under the leadership of Lieutenant General Sir Bryan Mahon, and Howell appointed as his chief of staff. General Sarrail commanded the French contingent, which largely comprised French colonial forces. The first month of the campaign were as predicted entangled with political wrangling, not least of which concerned Greek internal politics, primarily the ongoing rift between the pro-German monarchists and the government led by Prime Minister Venizelos. These required much negotiation and diplomacy, which included dealing with the difficult King Constantine of Greece, apart from military matters. Other issues included the logistics of having an ultimate command structure based at GHQ in Alexandria, Egypt, a distance of 1800 miles ‚Äì rather than the closer Malta. Eventually the new offensive was launched, and Howell was conveyed to the new frontline by a Royal Navy motor torpedo boat to Kavalla. As also predicted the new offensive came almost immediately up against strong Bulgaro-German resistance, and stalled. Indeed, the stalemate continued until 1918 tying down the vital resource of six Allied divisions. As a result of what some considered as a distorted publication (in \\"Brittania\\") of some private notes Howell had sent to a few individual generals and politicians outlining his views on Bulgaria (much earlier) before that country had even entered the war, Howell became embroiled in some controversy as being \\"Pro-Bulgar\\", which eventually resulted in a call for his recall by a few \\"Pro-Serbian\\" M.P.'s. Although Howell was not in the least anti-Serbian or a defeatest, he was happy to be released from a campaign he was not convinced would succeed. Legal action for libel against \\"Brittania\\", was considered, but because of his early death never concluded. Battle of the Somme Howell returned to the Western Front during the impending build up for the Battle of the Somme, which had largely been forced on the new British commander in chief, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, by French pressure to relieve the attrition being sustained at Verdun. He was appointed chief of staff and second-in- command to II Corps which formed part of General Sir Hubert Gough's Fifth Army. His corps commander was Lieutenant General Sir Claud Jacob, with whom he forged a strong partnership of command. Jacob later wrote \\"He was the most capable staff officer I have ever come across in all my service.\\" Gough's Fifth Army was held back during the opening July offensive at the Somme, which has become the subject of much historical scrutiny. Howell took advantage of this time to conduct an entire survey of the battlefield as it developed, and whilst disappointed that once again \\"lessons had not been learned\\", sought to find positives from which later actions would benefit. As a result of this, Douglas Haig requested that he compile a confidential report. Earlier in the war, Howell had actively sought to prevent the sending of battalions made up and commanded entirely by \\"green\\" conscripts. In one letter he outlines this in an annotated argument in which he points out that an army created from mixing new raw arrivals with experienced non-commissioned officers and soldiers to create a unit that was \\"fairly good throughout\\" was preferable to one made entirely of untrained conscripts in which \\"a small part was very good whilst the remainder were indifferent.\\" He was, therefore, opposed to \\"pals\\" battalions in essence, and after the initial Somme offensive reorganised some of the decimated remnants of some of these into the more experienced units of his command. More particularly he was adamant that divisional, brigade, and battalion commanders be properly briefed prior to any engagement. During August and into September 1916, Howell was given the opportunity to implement his tactical ideas in some relatively small engagements. These included afternoon offensives, synchronised barrages ‚Äì including the wider use of creeping barrages ‚Äì and the limited use of tanks. The purpose of afternoon attacks was that the enemy had less to time to reorganise before darkness fell (the German Army in both World Wars hardly ever engaged during the night) and this gave more time for the British attackers to regroup overnight. II Corps had already achieved better results with afternoon attacks. Importantly, he held detailed briefing for all commanders immediately before any attack, insuring that these understood all elements of the ongoing attack, and their role in it. The success of these small operations, although not perfect, began to unravel some initial objectives leading eventually (and after his death) to the success of the battles of Thiepval Ridge and thereon to Ancre Heights (a shared objective.) More particularly his efforts contributed to the taking of the enemy strongholds of the Schwaben Redoubt, and other \\"anchors\\" which the Germans used to keep a hold on the territory. Howell was never to see the completion of these offensives which included the final capture of Thiepval. He was a frequent visitor to frontline trenches, and to make personal observations so that he could be sure of undistorted facts. It was on one of these visits on 7 October 1916 that he was killed by shrapnel from a stray shell on the track leading from Authuilles. He was alone at the time. The previous day he had visited the front line trenches of his regiment the 4th Hussars at Dernancourt. Obituaries Howell received some approbation in the published obituaries and letters published in journals. Some of these defended him from the personal attacks made of him by Christabel Pankhurst's pamphlet \\"Brittania\\" whilst he served in Salonica. Howell said of himself that his own abilities stemmed from \\"the want of shaping up a muddle.\\" General Sir Bryan Mahon wrote: \\"Howell was a brilliant General Staff Officer, self-reliant, quick to grasp the situation, full of energy and enterprise. He performed exceptionally good service at Salonica under difficult and complicated conditions.\\" The Westminster Gazette said of him: \\"In the difficult times to come Howell's constructive mind would have brought him to a high place in the Army or the State. A few such men, with that rare combination of zeal with breadth, that absorption in giving rather than getting, that power of keeping the mind fresh and elastic in official harness, would be of infinite value to the nation.\\" Influence At the time of his death Howell was 38, and one of the youngest British generals of his generation. His was an anachronistic life. Too young to have overall authority and to make immediate the much needed changes to outmoded military practices, although at times his influence extended beyond his years. His military career and journalistic forays brought him into contact with all manner of people, some of considerable influence. He corresponded with Douglas Haig throughout his life, but also had enjoyed the friendship of Lloyd George. He was a regular correspondent with Gertrude Bell, and also counted many literary and artistic figures as his friends. Personal life Howell was one of five brothers and one sister. Neither rich nor poor he came from a family with strong trading and business enterprise in South East London. The family business, Hayter, Howell & Co, was a successful firm of military packers and merchants based in South-East London. One Howell ancestor, Sir Thomas Howell, had as a result of family business connections risen to prominence as Director of Contracts to the War Office (1855‚Äì1874) during the Crimean War. Earlier ancestors had been prominent guild merchants in Oswestry in Shropshire, several generations being Mayor of this market town in the Welsh Marches. Howell's military ambitions were not conceived from any compelling financial reasons (as argued by Robbins) but more directly from the fact of his father's career as a soldier in the Punjab, and a direct interest in military affairs, as well as an enormous sense of adventure - which characteristics he shared with most of the successful soldiers of his generation. Howell married Rosalind Upcher Buxton of Fritton Hall, Lowestoft, Norfolk. She came from a family of means (Barclays Bank), firmly embedded in the liberal establishment. She was also a close friend of many literary and artists of that generation including Nevinson, both Nash brothers, and George Bernard Shaw (whose Fabian meetings she regularly attended.) They had two children; a daughter, Deborah Howell, an eminent international veterinary surgeon (an expert on mastitis in cattle) and a son born posthumously, Paul Philip Howell, civil servant, overseas development expert, anthropologist and Cambridge academic. Howell is buried in the War Cemetery at Varennes, France. His gravestone bears the insignia of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars and the inscription \\"Fellowship is heaven and the lack of fellowship is hell.\\" References Further reading * Howell, Rosalind Upcher Philip Howell ‚Äì A Memoir by His Wife (1942) George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London * Daniel, David Scott The Story of The 4th Queen's Own Hussars (1959) Aldershot * Howell, Philip Campaign in Thrace ‚Äì 1912 (1913) Hugh Rees, London * Liddle Hart Military Archives Howell, Brig-Gen (1877‚Äì1916) Letters & Papers Kings College, London * Evans, Capt.

He was the subject of several paintings by his father and married his step-sister, Blanche Hosched√©. Early life Jean Monet was born to Camille Doncieux and Claude Monet on August 8, 1867. During that summer Claude Monet was staying at his father's house in Sainte-Adresse, a suburb of Le Havre. Monet went to Paris for the birth of Jean and returned to Sainte- Adresse on the 12th of the month. The first portrait that Monet made of his son was of the four-month-old Jean Monet in His Cradle. Alongside Jean was a woman Julie Vellay, a companion of Camille Pissarro, rather than his mother. According to Mary Mathews Gedo, author of Monet and his Muse: Camile Monet in the Artist's Life: ::The identification of Jean's attendant as someone other than his mother seems entirely consistent with what would prove to be Monet's future insistence on depicting Camille as 'unmother'. Mother and son were only shown in the same physical space in one painting during the Argenteuil years by Monet, The Luncheon. In 1868, after having left Paris to escape creditors and find more affordable housing, the three moved to Gloton, a small scenic village near Bennecourt. They were thrown out of the inn they were staying in for non-payment. Camille and Jean were able to stay with someone in the country, while Monet tried to obtain monies for survival. However, without money for a medical treatment, Jean became quite ill. After a dramatic period experienced by Camille and Jean, Claude was able to obtain funds for housing for his family in Le Havre. His parents were married on June 28, 1870. When Jean was a young child his mother and father had fled France during the Franco-Prussian War. They returned by the summer of 1872 when Claude painted his five-year-old son on a hobby horse in the garden of the home the family rented in Argenteuil near Paris. Claude Monet kept the painting, and never exhibited it, throughout his life.

A tireless advocate for \\"peoples capitalism\\", Walters was a president of the National Organization for Raw Materials (NORM), a long-time executive board member, and founder and editor of Acres USA, the North American voice of eco- agriculture, organic farming, and the family farm. Early life Charles Walters Jr. was born in Ness County, Kansas to Carl and Dorothea Walters, poor farmers struggling to survive the Dust Bowl. Walters' childhood was shaped first by the Dust Bowl, then by the Great Depression. He came of age following military service in the waning days of World War II. Once discharged, he received his undergraduate degree from Creighton University and earned a master's degree in economics from University of Denver on the G.I. Bill.Kansas City Star, Obituary of Charles Walters. As he made his way around several major urban centers before finally settling in Kansas City, Missouri, with his wife, Ann, Charles Walters never lost his connection to the world of farming. As an economist and the son of a dirt farmer during the Kansas dust bowl, it was not lost on him when a flood of corporate money pushed the American farmer into an expensive new dependence on farm machinery, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides‚Äî about which little was known.Our History.‚Äù A turning point for him, as for many Americans, was the publication of Rachael Carson's Silent Spring in September 1962, which documented the detrimental effects pesticides were having on the environment. Carson's narrative would be the cornerstone of the point-of-view Walters would bring to his writings and social criticism. National Farmers Organization (NFO) During the 1960s, Walters became associated with the National Farmers Organization (NFO) and edited the organization's news publication, NFO Reporter. He also supplied numerous articles on farm economics for the publication, observing and documenting many of the activities of the NFO. One of his books, Holding Action, discusses the events surrounding the milk holding actions of 1967.Walters, Charles. Holding Action. Halcyon House, 1968. 336p; The Charles Walters Papers (1937-2003, n.d.), Special Collections Department, Iowa State University. Raw Materials Economics Professionally, Walters worked as an economist and journalist producing a number of books and essays. His main professional focus was on raw materials economics, greatly influenced by the works of Carl H. Wilken, Charles B. Ray, J. Carson Adkerson, and John Lee Coulter, four men who would later become known as the \\"Fathers of Raw Material Economics.\\" Walters, too, must have made an impression, for he would later serve as a president of the National Organization for Raw Materials (NORM) and served on its executive board. He remained a member of NORM's executive Board until his death and has since joined its Hall of Fame.The NORM Hall of Fame # Raw material economics is based upon a simple idea: that raw materials income from its farms, ranches, timberlands, oceans, mines, wells, and recycling centers governs national income unless the latter is expanded by debt; since agriculture is the largest producer of new raw materials each year, it is the largest annual source of raw materials income. # The health, robustness, and sustainability of the American economy is directly tied to the production of raw materials and the price at which those raw materials first enter into commercial channels. When raw materials enter trade channels at prices in balance with the prices of labor and capital, the economy operates on an earned-income basis with no buildup of public and private debt. Conversely, when raw materials enter trade channels at less-than-parity prices with labor and capital, the economy lacks sufficient earned dollars to operate on a debt-free basis; therefore, public and private debt accumulates. Mentoring under Carl Wilken, Walters became the consummate reference source on Raw Material Economics and the foremost authority about the raw materials equation. Early in his professional career, he witnessed the powerful array of well-entrenched professors, politicians, bankers, and free traders who undermined all efforts at educating the American public and its congressional and statehouse leaders about Raw Material Economics. His mentor, Carl Wilken, had spent more time testifying before Congress prior to this death than any other American, arguing the case of a change in banking policy that would make US capitalism a generative economy, rather than a predatory one ‚Äì to no avail.Carl Wilken Hall of Fame profile. Over the course of time, Walters made a breakthrough. He realized how the methodical cheating of small farmers and the enforced swing toward chemical agriculture were gears in the same machine, working in tandem to transform the countryside ‚Äì and not for the better. Corporate power and public policy were colluding in the destruction of the family farm, and the process was swift. Acres USA In 1970, despondent with internal politics at the NFO, Walters founded Acres USA, a monthly magazine that promotes the family farm and organic farming and served as the executive editor for 28 years. Remembering the origins of Acres USA in 1995 for the journal‚Äôs 25th anniversary issue, Walters said, \\"I didn't have the money to buy a paper, so I started one. I wanted the freedom that went with making my own decisions without the blessings of higher approved authority.\\" Later, he assumed the status of editor emeritus while his son, Fred Walters, published the magazine from his home in Austin, Texas. Charles Walters Jr. remained in Kansas City, Missouri. Yet, the enormity of the task did nothing to deter Walters and he spent more than 40 years focusing a journalistic spotlight upon the U.S. economy's downward spiral into public and private debt seemingly without end and tracing its origins to ‚Äúfree market‚Äù policies of cheap food and free trade.Carl H. Wilken, NORM Hall of Fame biographical profile; Charles Walters, NORM Hall of Fame biographical profile. Perhaps, Walters' most significant contribution was the rescuing of the science of organic agriculture before the takeover of US agriculture by the petrochemical giants. One of these was Dr. William A. Albrecht, a University of Missouri professor whose low profile obscured decades of brilliant work in soil science. Albrecht's papers, which Walters rescued from the historical dustbin and published in several volumes, provided a rock-solid foundation for this new, scientific approach to organic farming that Acres U.S.A. liked to call eco-agriculture.Albrecht Papers Vol. 1-8 + Video . Another important figure to the organic farming movement whose ideas had disappeared from public consciousness was that of Maynard Murray (1910-1983), a medical doctor and a pioneer in merging the disciplines of biology, health and agriculture as early as the 1930s when he began experimenting with ‚Äúsea-solids‚Äù ‚Äì mineral salts that remain after total sea water evaporation to reveal that trace minerals and other elements present in sea water were optimum for growth and health of both land and sea life. Acres published Murray's Sea Energy Agriculture in 1976 and again in 2001. Largely ignored during his lifetime, Murray's lifelong quest contributed greatly to our understanding of the role of trace minerals in the healthy growth of all organisms on the planet.Murray, Maynard. Sea energy agriculture. 2nd ed. revised. Austin, TX: Acres, USA, 2003. vii, 109p. Nauta, Phil. Building soils naturally. Austin, TX: Acres, USA, 2012. xvi, 303p. Acres USA was acquired by Swift Communications in 2016. Selected publications In addition to writing and publishing hundreds of articles about Raw Material Economics in the pages of Acres USA, Walters authored three major works on the subject. His second book, Unforgiven (1971), now in its second edition (2003), is the definitive text on Raw Material Economics derived from in-depth interviews with Carl H. Wilken, shortly before Wilken's death in 1968. A subsequent book, Raw Material Economics: A NORM Primer was published in 1982. This volume is still in print and updates the status of raw material economics into the mid-1980s. Walters also authored a paperback booklet entitled: PARITY‚ÄîThe Key to Prosperity Unlimited. The list below includes these publications and many others. * Eco- Farm, An Acres U.S.A.

Prior to the Battle of Arsal in August 2014, the Lebanese Army has tried to keep out of it and the violence has been mostly between various factions within the country and overt Syrian involvement has been limited to airstrikes and occasional accidental incursions. Early incidents Lebanese army personnel on Syria Street, guarding the border between Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen in 2011 In interfactional clashes in Tripoli, seven people were killed and 59 wounded, on 17 June 2011. Clashes erupted following a rally in support of Syrian protesters. Fighting broke out between gunmen positioned in the rival neighborhoods of Jabal Mohsen (mainly Alawites who support the Syrian government) and Bab al-Tabbaneh (mainly Sunnis, supporting the Syrian uprising). Among the dead were a Lebanese army soldier and an official from the Alawite Arab Democratic Party. From 10 to 11 February 2012, two or three people died in fighting in Tripoli's neighborhoods of Jabal Mohsen and Bab al- Tebbaneh. An intervention by the Lebanese Army resulted in the injury of six soldiers. On 29 April 2012, the Lebanese navy confiscated a large consignment of arms and ammunition on the container ship \\"Lutfallah II,\\" which was headed for the port of Tripoli in northern Lebanon before it was intercepted. The ship had begun its voyage from Libya and it is generally believed the consignment was destined for the rebels in Syria. Four people were also wounded during a clash between supporters of the Syrian opposition and Sunni supporters of Assad from the Tawheed Movement. May 2012 Bab al- Tabbaneh‚ÄìJabal Mohsen clashes In May 2012, Salafists demanded the release of a Sunni Islamist, Shadi Mawlawi, who had been arrested on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization.Death toll in Lebanon‚Äôs Tripoli rises amid sectarian clashes NOW lebanon, 14 May 2012 The arrest of Mawlawi triggered a new round of fighting between Islamists and Alawites in Tripoli. Two to four people were killed when fighting erupted on the night of 12 May 2012. In the evening of 12 May, rocket-propelled grenades were used in an Alawite enclave and surrounding Sunni neighbourhoods in the port city. Hours before the clashes, Lebanese troops exchanged fire with a group of Islamists protesting in Tripoli for the release of a terrorism suspect. The Islamists tried to approach the offices of the pro-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In all, three of the dead were reportedly Sunni civilians, while one was an army officer. The fighting continued on 14 May, which resulted in the death of five Alawites and one Sunni. The army then deployed to the area on 15 May, and engaged in gunbattles with residents that left eight wounded, including a soldier. By 16 May, the clashes left 11 dead, including a soldier. By 18 May, a total of 12 people were dead and more than 100 wounded in the clashes. Killing of Ahmad Abdel-Wahid On 20 May 2012, a prominent Lebanese Sunni cleric, Ahmad Abdel-Wahid, and his aide, Mohammed Merheb, were killed by the Lebanese Army, when failing to stop at a check point in Akkar. His death provoked protesters into cutting off roads in many parts of the country with burning tires. The following day, 22 army personnel present at the shooting were arrested. On 22 May, the Islamist Shadi Mawlawi was released in Tripoli. On 24 May, the Islamist protesters in Tripoli threatened that their demonstrations would spread all over Lebanon if about 180 Islamists arrested and accused of participating in the 2007 Lebanon conflict were not released. Beirut clashes On 20 May 2012, the evening following the killing of Sheikh Abdel-Wahid, clashes erupted in Beirut's Tariq Jdideh neighborhood between armed Sunni militants of the Future Movement and Sunnis of Tayyar al-Arabi, leaving three dead and ten wounded and creating a tense security situation in the capital and the country as a whole. On 6 September 2012, two people were wounded in gunfights between Future Movement members in Beirut, and the army was deployed in the area. Kidnappings In May 2012, Syrian opposition members kidnapped three pro-Syrian government Lebanese in the village of Zeita near the Syrian border. In retaliation, 60 Syrian workers were kidnapped. The prisoners were exchanged on 16 May. On 22 May, at least 16 Lebanese Shia pilgrims were reportedly kidnapped by the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo. The FSA denied responsibility and blamed them on what they termed \\"mafia gangs\\" and stated that they would help free the pilgrims. The kidnappers said they would release the pilgrims if Lebanon recognised the Syrian opposition. Of 11 hostages being held, one was released on 25 August. In late May, two Lebanese farmers were kidnapped and transported to Syria by pro-Syrian government forces. Rifaat Eid of the Arab Democratic Party mediated for their release, which occurred on 3 June. Several people were kidnapped, in response to other kidnappings, in June. On 25 August, a Kuwaiti citizen was kidnapped in Howsh al-Ghanam in the Bekaa valley. However, the political nature of the kidnapping was questioned by the security services. The Shia al-Meqdad clan abducted a group of 20 people, mainly alleged FSA members but also a Turk, in retaliation for the kidnapping of Hassan al-Meqdad on 13 August 2012 by the FSA. The armed branch of the clan threatened more actions if he was not released. Several others who were kidnapped earlier were released as they were not affiliated with the FSA. As a result of the kidnappings and warnings, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and other Gulf Arab countries warned its citizens to leave Lebanon. Hezbollah's Nasrallah said the situation was out of control and, in turn, prompted criticism of Hezbollah by 14 March. June‚ÄìJuly Tripoli clashes On 30 May 2012, two people were wounded in clashes between the Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen neighborhoods. On 2‚Äì3 June, 15 people were killed and over 60 wounded in clashes around Tripoli. As a result of the fighting, the Army re-entered Syria Street, that divides the warring neighborhoods. Following the declaration of a cease-fire, during the night of 3 June, one policeman and one soldier were wounded. On 8 June, one person was killed and three others were wounded when gunfire hit the Alawite neighborhood in Tripoli. On 25 June, there were clashes between families supporting different political factions in Miniyeh, North Lebanon. On 18 July, one was killed and several were wounded during anti-Syrian celebrations in Tripoli, following the bombing of several Syrian ministers. On 27 July, two men who were on their way home to Jabal Mohsen were stabbed, which lead to clashes. Clashes near Lebanese‚ÄìSyrian Border At the beginning of the summer 2012, two Hezbollah fighters were killed in a clash with Syrian rebels who were on Lebanese territory. On 17 September, Syrian Ground-attack aircraft fired missiles into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted president Michel Sleiman to launch an investigation. On 22 September, members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from dignified locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's neutral position. Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns. On 11 October 2012, shells fired by the Syrian military hit Masharih al-Qaa, where previous shelling incidents have caused fatalities. Lebanon's position of ignoring the attacks remained unchanged. In October Hassan Nasrallah denied Hezbollah was fighting alongside the Syrian army, but that Lebanese in Syria were only protecting Lebanese inhabited villages from the Free Syrian Army. June 2012 refugee camp clashes On 16 June 2012, a Palestinian man was killed and eight others were wounded in clashes with the Lebanese Army in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp. On 18 June, two Palestinians were killed and 10 more wounded in the camp and one Palestinian was killed in Ain al-Hilweh camp while protesting by the Lebanese Army. On 27 June, clashes erupted in the Bourj al- Barajneh camp, with no casualties. Ahmed al-Assir sit in The Sunni cleric Sheikh Ahmed Al-Assir and his supporters staged a sit in in Sidon to protest Hezbollah's weapons. This led to clashes between Assir-supporters and members of the Popular Nasserist Organization. An AFP photographer was beaten during the clash. The following day, counter-protests were held. On 8 August 2012, a gunfight between supporters and rivals of Assir wounded five, including two women. Michel Samaha arrest On 9 August 2012, Lebanese police arrested former minister Michel Samaha, who was later indicted for inciting sectarian strife through \\"terrorist attacks\\" on behalf of the Syrian government. The court also indicted two Syrian army officials, the head of Syrian National Security Bureau Ali Mamlouk and Brigadier General Adnan. Reportedly, Samaha confessed to planning on carrying out several bombings in northern Lebanon. The March 14 alliance called for a rapid investigation and, if confirmed, an immediate cutting of relations with Syria. The ruling March 8 alliance meanwhile dismissed Samaha's arrest as a \\"March 14 campaign\\". August Tripoli clashes On 9 August 2012, Sunni supporters of Hezbollah from the Tawheed Movement clashed with Salafists in Tripoli. On 20 and 21 August 12 people were killed and more than 100 wounded, including 15 soldiers, in clashes between Sunni Muslims and Alawites in Tripoli, according to security and medical sources. At least two of the dead were from Jabal Mohsen and five were from Bab al-Tabbaneh. Five of the soldiers were injured by gunfire, and another five after a grenade was lobbed at an army checkpoint. On 22 August, the Lebanese Army deployed troops into the feuding neighborhoods. However, the army sustained heavy casualties, and was forced to retreat. After opening a dialogue with community leaders, the army managed to forge a ceasefire between the two parties. The ceasefire dissolved on 23 August, as fresh clashes erupted across the city. The Lebanese Army has deployed tanks to the neighbourhoods. On 24 August, further fighting occurred between Sunni and Alawite fighters in the Qobbah and Jabal Muhsin neighbourhoods. At least 7 Alawite-owned shops in Sunni neighborhoods were torched. Fighting escalated after the death of Sunni cleric Khaled al Baradei, shot by a sniper during the morning skirmishes. Sheikh Baradei was reportedly a commander of the Sunni Islamist fighters. Two journalists were also wounded during the day's fighting. Wissam al-Hassan assassination On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in Achrafiyeh, including Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. There was speculation that Syria, or its allies, were behind the attack. Al-Hassan had also led the investigation that implicated Syria and its ally Hezbollah in the killing of Rafik al-Hariri. However, al-Hassan himself had also been a prime suspect during the Hariri investigation, and had close ties with Saudi intelligence, and was said to have ties to Mossad. The assassination triggered violent unrest throughout the country. A host of Future TV called on a crowd to head toward the Grand Serail, and the protesters subsequently clashed with the police. Sunni gunmen set up checkpoints, scrutinising the sectarian identify of passers by. Following Wissam al-Hassan's death, Saad Hariri directly accused the Syrians of being behind the attack, while the Future Movement called on Prime Minister Najib Mikati to immediately resign.Future bloc calls on premier to immediately resign NOW Lebanon, October 2012 Sheikh Abdul Razzaq al-Asmar of the Islamic Unification Movement was killed in Tripoli the same day, when pro-Hariri gunmen took control of Tripoli and clashed with IUM and SSNP members. On 21 October, violent clashes occurred throughout the country. Two young girls and a man were killed during clashes between Bab Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen. The following night, pro-Hariri gunmen clashed with rivals in the Tariq al-Jadeedah neighbourhood of Beirut. Two Sunnis and an Alawite were killed in Tripoli and 15 people were wounded on 22 October. In total, clashes from 19 to 23 October left 10 dead and 65 wounded. On 24 October, Future Movement protesters clashed with the Lebanese army. Sidon clash On 11 November 2012, three people were killed and four others wounded after supporters of Salafi cleric Ahmed al-Assir clashed with supporters of Hezbollah in the southern city of Sidon. Assir stated \\"We have a blood score to settle with Hizbullah that can only be settled with blood\\", and that he considered forming an \\"armed resistance group.\\" Tall Kalakh incident On 30 November 2012, between 14 and 20 Islamists from North Lebanon, as well a Palestinian, were killed in an ambush in Tall Kalakh near the Lebanese border. They had gone to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian rebels. On 2 December, Lebanese soldiers clashed with Syrian rebels near the Syrian border. Renewed violence in Tripoli December 2012 VOA report on the conflict in Tripoli At least 12 people were killed and 73 injured in Tripoli between 4 and 6 December 2012, in heavy clashes, which were sparked by the Tall Kalakh incident.

Fourteen volumes have been published since July 30, 2012. The author has stated that he has planned for 17 novels but with enough popularity may continue further. A manga adaptation by Satoshi ≈åshio, with art by Hugin Miyama, began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine Comp Ace from November 26, 2014. Both the light novels and the manga are licensed in North America by Yen Press, with a release date of November 8, 2016. The anime television series adaptation by Madhouse consists of 3 seasons with 13 episodes each, with the first season airing from July 7 to September 29, 2015. Two compilation anime films recapping the events from the first season were released in Japan on February 25, 2017, and March 11, 2017, respectively. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018, with the third season premiering later the same year on July 10, 2018, after which the last episode aired on October 2, 2018. The scriptwriter for the anime series discussed the possibility of the fourth season at AnimagiC 2019 in Germany, saying that it was \\"extremely likely\\" that it would be produced. Plot In the year 2126, a Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or DMMORPG called YGGDRASIL was released, standing out among all other DMMORPGs due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. After an intense twelve-year run the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only 4 of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal \\"Overlord\\" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down. When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga finds that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if YGGDRASIL has been recreated as its own reality along with its various NPCs having been brought to life. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even to log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if anyone from the real world is also in this new world with him. Taking on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown, a message to any other players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature beyond ethical concerns with near-limitless power.

In 1996, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacks, which targeted ethnic Serb villages and Serbian governmental buildings and police stations. The insurgency led to the Kosovo War in February 1998. Background The Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of the Albanians in 1877‚Äì1878 from areas that became incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. Since then the two peoples have had problems with each other. The 1950s and 1960s were a period marked by repression and anti Albanian policies in Kosovo under Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, a Serbian communist who later fell out and was dismissed by Tito. During this time nationalism for Kosovar Albanians became a conduit to alleviate the conditions of the time. In 1968 Yugoslav Serb officials warned about rising Albanian nationalism and by November unrest and demonstrations by thousands of Albanians followed calling for Kosovo to attain republic status, an independent Albanian language university and some for unification with Albania. Tito rewrote the Yugoslav constitution (1974) and tried to address Albanian complaints by awarding the province of Kosovo autonomy and powers such as a veto in the federal decision making process similar to that of the republics. Kosovo functioned as a de facto republic because Kosovar Albanians attained the ability to pursue near independent foreign relations, trade and cultural links with Albania, an independent Albanian language university and Albanology institute, an Academy of Sciences and Writers association with the ability to fly the Albanian flag. Military precursors to the KLA began in the late 1980s with armed resistance to Serb police trying to take Albanian activists in custody. Prior to the KLA, its members had been part of organizations such as the National Kosovo Movement and Popular Movement for Kosovo Liberation. The founders of the later KLA were involved in the 1981 protests in Kosovo. Many ethnic Albanian dissidents were arrested or moved to European countries, where they continued subversive activities. Repression of Albanian nationalism and Albanian nationalists by authorities in Belgrade strengthened the independence movement and focused international attention toward the plight of Kosovar Albanians. From 1991 to 1992, Albanian nationalist Adem Jashari and about 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing to fight for the independence of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham√´z, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, forcing the Serbs to withdraw from the village. While in Albania, Jashari was arrested in 1993 by the government of Sali Berisha and sent to jail in Tirana before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the Albanian Army. Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years, targeting the Yugoslav Army (VJ) and Serbian police in Kosovo. In the spring of 1993, \\"Homeland Calls\\" meetings were held in Aarau, Switzerland, organized by Xhavit Halili, Azem Syla, Jashar Salihu and others. KLA strategist Xhavit Halili said that in 1993, the KLA 'considered and then rejected the IRA, PLO and ETA models'. Some journalists claim that a May 1993 attack in Glogovac that left five Serbian policemen dead and two wounded was the first one carried out by the KLA. History =1995= By early 1990s there were attacks on police forces and secret- service officials who abused Albanian civilians. A Serbian policeman was killed in 1995, allegedly by the KLA. Since 1995, the KLA sought to destabilize the region, hoping the United States and NATO intervene. Serbian patrols were ambushed and policemen killed. It was only in the next year that the organization of KLA took responsibility for attacks. =1996‚Äì97= The KLA, originally composed out of a few hundred Bosnian War veterans, Albanians, attacked several police stations and wounded many police officers in 1996‚Äì97. In 1996 the British weekly The European carried an article by a French expert stating that \\"German civil and military intelligence services have been involved in training and equipping the rebels with the aim of cementing German influence in the Balkan area. (...) The birth of the KLA in 1996 coincided with the appointment of Hansjoerg Geiger as the new head of the BND (German secret Service). (...) The BND men were in charge of selecting recruits for the KLA command structure from the 500,000 Kosovars in Albania.\\"Fallgot, Roger (1998): \\"How Germany Backed KLA\\", in The European, 21 ‚Äì 27 September. pp. 21‚Äì27 Former senior adviser to the German parliament Matthias K√ºntzel tried to prove later on that German secret diplomacy had been instrumental in helping the KLA since its creation.K√ºntzel, Matthias (2002): Der Weg in den Krieg. Deutschland, die Nato und das Kosovo (The Road to War. Germany, Nato and Kosovo). Elefanten Press. Berlin, Germany. pp. 59‚Äì64 . Cemetery of Albanians killed by Serbs during the Kosovo war in Gjakova KLA representatives met with American, British, and Swiss intelligence agencies in 1996, and possibly \\"several years earlier\\" and according to The Sunday Times, \\"American intelligence agents have admitted they helped to train the Kosovo Liberation Army before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia\\". Intelligence agents denied, however, that they were involved in arming the KLA. In February 1996 the KLA undertook a series of attacks against police stations and Yugoslav government employees, saying that the Yugoslav authorities had killed Albanian civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbian authorities denounced the KLA as a terrorist organization and increased the number of security forces in the region. This had the counter-productive effect of boosting the credibility of the embryonic KLA among the Kosovo Albanian population. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo. In January 1997, Serbian security forces assassinated KLA commander Zahir Pajaziti and two other leaders in a highway attack between Pristina and Mitrovica, and arrested more than 100 Albanian militants. Jashari was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court on 11 July 1997. Human Rights Watch subsequently described the trial, in which fourteen other Kosovo Albanians were also convicted, as \\"[failing] to conform to international standards.\\" The Albanian civil war of 1997 enabled the KLA to acquire large amounts of weapons looted from Albanian armories. A 1997 intelligence report stated that the KLA received drug trafficking proceeds, used to purchase arms. The KLA received large funds from Albanian diaspora organizations. There is a possibility that among donators to the KLA were people involved in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, however insufficient evidence exists that the KLA itself was involved in such activities. =1998= The NATO North Atlantic Council said that KLA was \\"the main initiator of the violence\\" and that it had \\"launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation\\". James Bissett, Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania, wrote in 2001 that media reports indicate that \\"as early as 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency assisted by the British Special Air Service were arming and training Kosovo Liberation Army members in Albania to foment armed rebellion in Kosovo\\" with the hope that \\"NATO could intervene (...)\\".Bissett, James (31 July 2001) . Toronto Star Pursuing Adem Jashari for the murder of a Serbian policeman, Serbian forces again attempted to assault the Jashari compound in Prekaz on 22 January 1998. With Jashari not present, thousands of Kosovo Albanians descended on Prekaz and again succeeded in pushing the Serbian forces out of the village and its surroundings. The next month, a small unit of the KLA was ambushed by Serbian policemen. Four Serbs were killed and two were injured in the ensuing clashes. At dawn on 5 March 1998, the KLA launched an attack against a police patrol in Prekaz, which was then answered by a police operation on the Jashari compound which left 58 Albanians dead, including Jashari. Four days after this, a NATO meeting was convoked, during which Madeleine Albright pushed for an anti- Serbian response. NATO now threatened Serbia with military response. The Kosovo War ensued, with subsequent NATO intervention. Attacks The KLA launched 31 attacks in 1996, 55 in 1997, and 66 in January and February 1998. After the KLA killed four policemen in early March 1998, special Serbian police units retaliated and attacked three villages in Drenica. The Kosovo War ensued. The total number of attacks in 1998 was 1,470, compared to 66 the year before. Between 1991 and 1997, mostly in 1996‚Äì97, 39 persons were killed by KLA. Attacks between 1996 and February 1998 led to the death of 10 policemen and 24 civilians. See also *History of Kosovo References =Sources=       Further reading Cl√©ment, Sophia.

It was a widespread philosophy among well-to-do women in the British Empire, particularly Canada, from the late 19th century until after World War I (1914‚Äì18). The concept was attacked by later feminists as accepting the paternalist view of society and providing an excuse for inequality. Early years Christina Hoff Sommers, a critic of late 20th century feminism, has defined maternal feminism as a \\"recognition that the sexes are equal but different.\\" Sommers contrasts the \\"egalitarian feminism\\" of Mary Wollstonecraft (1759‚Äì1797) to the maternal feminism of Hannah More (1745‚Äì1833). Wollstonecraft thought, \\"men and women were essentially the same in their spirits and souls, deserving of the same rights.\\" According to Sommers, \\"Hannah [More] met women where they were. She believed there was a feminine nature and that women were caring and nurturing, different from men but deserving of equality.\\" More was very popular in her day, but if she is remembered now it is for accepting and rationalizing the patriarchal system of her day. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810‚Äì1865) The conservative English authors Frances Trollope (1779‚Äì1863) and Elizabeth Gaskell (1810‚Äì65) both thought that women should be better educated so they would be less dependent on men. Trollope thought that financially secure women should go beyond providing moral education to their children, and should express in public their maternal values, social concerns and caring outlook. Her novels repeatedly show how a young heroine can improve a corrupt society through her moral influence. To some early feminists, such as the novelist Fanny Fern (1811‚Äì72) and the temperance leader Letitia Youmans (1827‚Äì96), maternal feminism was simply a strategy through which women could achieve their goal of equal rights. In the United States, women became active in social reform in the early 1830s, but were constrained by traditional concepts of maternal feminism. When the Female Moral Reform Society (FMRS) was founded in 1834 there was considerable criticism of the fact that respectable women were discussing prostitution. The protofeminism of this society was lost as it evolved into a charity running homes for reformed prostitutes. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the largest women's organization in the US by the 1880s, provided an opportunity for women to participate in causes such as prison reform, labor conditions, education, purity and suffrage. However, the WCTU saw women purely as wives and mothers, accepting the constraints of maternal feminism. Related movements Maternal feminism reached its peak at a time when the British Empire was still expanding fast, but new ideas about women's suffrage, temperance, pacifism and socialism were in the air. Talking of this period Veronica Strong-Boag (b. 1947) said, \\"Women themselves, like virtually everyone else in Canadian society, identified their sex with a maternal role. A re-invigorated motherhood, the natural occupation for virtually all women, could serve as a buttress against all the destabilizing elements in Canada.\\" The growth of maternal feminism at the expense of the new woman in Britain and her colonies may have been due in part to the rapid expansion of the British empire after 1870. The Anglo-Saxon birth rate seemed to be falling while the infant mortality rate was rising. There was concern about a shortage of Britons \\"to fill the empty spaces of the empire.\\" To ensure an adequate supply of Anglo-Saxons, women were flooded with propaganda that urged them to become \\"mothers of the race\\" by having more children, a superior purpose that was embraced by many feminists. Racism and imperialism thus contributed to support for maternal feminism. Edith Wrigley (1879‚Äì1964), wife of George Weston Wrigley (1847‚Äì1907), edited the women's column in Citizen and Country, a newspaper that supported the Canadian Socialist League (CSL). She was also active in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In her column \\"The Kingdom of the Home\\" Wrigley expressed the maternal feminist position that love and purity, the values of the home, should also become the guiding principles of politics. Margaret Haile ran in the 1902 provincial election for the CSL in North Toronto. She was said to be the first woman in the British Empire to compete in a political election. She also \\"still clung to the notion of the home as a traditional source of woman's power\\". Ruth Lestor became known as the first lady socialist lecturer in Canada during a speaking tour for the SPC in 1909‚Äì11. She sometimes used maternal feminist rhetoric when calling women to become socialist. This did not reflect her underlying belief in complete sexual equality. In the 19th and early 20th centuries there were strong ties between maternal feminism and the suffrage and temperance movements, both of which aimed to improve the conditions of women and children at home and at work. There was also a natural link between pacifism and maternal feminism. Augusta Stowe-Gullen (1857‚Äì1943) said in 1915 that \\"when women have a voice in national and international affairs, war will cease forever.\\" This became an increasingly hard position to support as World War I dragged on. Some who stayed true to maternal feminism and pacifism during the war were also socialist or communist, such as the Canadian Gertrude Richardson. Rose Henderson (1871‚Äì1937) was another Canadian socialist and peace activist who embraced maternal feminism. Their radicalism gave ammunition to opponents of feminism. Theory and practice Lady Aberdeen, head of the National Council of Women of Canada Maternal feminism combines the concepts of maternalism and feminism. Many of the maternalist reformers and organizations like the Elizabeth Fry Society and the Salvation Army did not identify themselves as feminist, and pursued strategies and objectives that were different from those of feminists. Maternalism appealed to bourgeois women interested in reforming the lower orders, and provided the excuse for intrusive surveillance of working class women and girls. It was not in itself feminist in any way. There also were different types of feminist. The \\"new women\\" or \\"equal rights\\" feminists did not accept maternalism. But the acceptable language of maternalism was tactically convenient to feminists who were willing to accept being locked into activities surrounding the home and family in return for other freedoms. The ideology of Maternal feminism incorporates ideas from social feminism and domestic feminism. Social feminists were more concerned with social reform than with women's rights, but felt that women should be able to play a public role in social reform due to their nature as women. Domestic feminism claimed that women should have more autonomy within the family. It did not go further since women were prohibited any form of participation in public life. Combining the two gives the concept that \\"women's special role as mother gives her the duty and the right to participate in the public sphere.\\" Maternal feminists did not see maternalism as being limited to biological maternity. They extended it to social or spiritual motherhood, and saw no reason why a woman should not remain single and devote herself to a professional career or to social causes. Ellen Key (1849‚Äì1926) of Sweden thought motherhood was women's \\"highest cultural task\\", and considered that mothers should not work away from home. On the other hand, she was an early advocate of female suffrage, and thought every woman should have complete freedom to follow her individuality. She viewed motherhood as more important than marriage, and so was seen by American feminists of the 1910s as a radical and supporter of sexual liberation. In Germany there was fierce debate among feminists about how to handle prostitution, seen as the source of venereal diseases and thus a major health problem. Hanna Bieber-B√∂hm (1851‚Äì1910), Anna Pappritz (1861‚Äì1939) and Helene St√∂cker (1869‚Äì1943) advocated different solutions. Bieber-B√∂hm favoured stronger legal action by the state against the clients of prostitutes. Pappritz and St√∂cker were both opposed to state surveillance and control of prostitutes. Pappritz proposed moral education of young people and encouragement of abstinence outside marriage, while Stocker thought that giving women more sexual freedom would eliminate the demand for prostitution. The more nurturing approach of Pappritz may be seen as closest to maternal feminism. In 1893 Lady Aberdeen (1857‚Äì1939), head of the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC), said mothering was the \\"grand woman's mission\\". NCWC delegates pledged to \\"conserve the highest good of the family and state\\" but to remain \\"aloof from issues pertaining to women's rights.\\" The maternal feminism ideology, with its assumption that all women had common interests, prompted many women of the upper and middle classes to look for ways to help poorer women through clubs, unions, settlement houses and so on. Women of the elite such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815‚Äì1902) of America and Marguerite Durand (1864‚Äì1936) of France felt that with their better education and broader experience they had a natural duty to lead. Often they lacked empathy with the women they were trying to help, refused to cede control to these women and wanted to reform them as well as assist. Ellice Hopkins (1836‚Äì1904) exemplifies this attitude when calling in England in 1882 for \\"the greater utilization of the increasing culture of upper-class women to bring light and higher influence as well as brightness and beauty, to the 'dim populations' of our great factory towns, especially the toiling working women and mother. Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874‚Äì1942), best known as author of Anne of Green Gables (1908), presented maternal feminist views in her books published in the period around World War I (1914-18). In Anne's secure world of Avonlea women make most of the decisions. Nellie McClung (1873‚Äì1951) of Manitoba, Canada said \\"A woman's place is in the home; and out of it whenever she is called to guard those she loves and to improve conditions for them.\\" In her 1915 book In Times Like These McClung wrote, Nellie McClung (1873‚Äì1951) played a leading role in the maternal feminist movement in Canada McClung wrote that \\"The woman's outlook on life is to save, to care for, to help. Men make wounds, and women bind them up.\\" It was due to biological differences that women were morally superior to men and should have the vote. A modern feminist would see this as a reductive and biologically determinist view of gender, but at the time the concept did represent an advance towards giving women a greater and more meaningful role. In 1918 Canada gave women the right to vote, other than Inuit and Indians. Two years later Canadian women were given the right to run for election. However, the modern, urbanized \\"flappers\\" had little interest in the old-fashioned, moralistic causes of suffrage and temperance. The leaders of the maternal feminist movement were middle-aged and the maternal feminist movement was in decline. There was still some progress. On 18 October 1929 Lord Sankey of the Privy Council overruled the Supreme Court of Canada and ruled that women were legally eligible to be appointed to the Senate of Canada. He said, \\"The exclusion of women from all public offices is a relic of days more barbarous than our\\". This was the culmination of a struggle led by judge Emily Murphy of Edmonton and four other prominent western women: Henrietta Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney and Irene Parlby. The \\"Famous Five\\" were all advocates of maternal feminism, believing that women's distinctive biology suited them for a role in public life. With this ruling Canadian women were finally established as legal persons. A few days later the stock market crash led to the start of the Great Depression. Later analysis Wayne Roberts noted in 1979 that the concept of \\"mother of the race\\" had replaced the more radical earlier feminist concept of \\"the new woman\\". The attempt to reconcile the domestic and maternal ideal with the push for equality handicapped the early feminist movement and limited the gains it made. The radical potential of the suffrage movement was crushed by \\"stultifying definitions of motherhood\\". Another criticism is that the exhortion to women to \\"mother the race\\" had racial undertones directed at new immigrants at the lowest level of the social hierarchy. There has been violent argument over whether maternal feminism in Germany led to Nazi-era coercive policies related to the family and reproduction. The historian Nancy F. Cott has proposed that maternal feminism would be better called \\"municipal housekeeping\\" or \\"civic maternalism\\", since by accepting existing sex roles it was not truly feminism. Helene St√∂cker (1869‚Äì1943) was a sexual reformer who believed women should not strive to be like men Other historians defend the movement as letting women maintain their female identity rather than become like men to bargain for their rights. As Helene St√∂cker said \\"No, no, not to be a man or to want to be a man or to be mistaken for a man: how should that help us!\\". Naomi Black sees maternal feminism as inherently radical. Its proponents were \\"committed, whether they [knew] it or not, to a basic transformation of patriarchal structures and values.\\" The dismissive attitude typical of the 1970s has given way to a more understanding view of maternal feminism as a strategic adaptation to social attitudes of the time. Women's demands for reform were less threatening when expressed in maternal terms. The central role of evangelical Protestantism in the early feminist movement is better understood, and the view that early feminists were focused on suffrage has given way to an understanding of their interest in prohibition, eugenics, morality laws, financial security and protection of women and children. Recent years The concept of maternal feminism is resilient. In January 1993 CBS debuted a \\"soft\\" drama for family viewing called Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman about a woman doctor in Colorado Springs, Colorado in the late 1860s. Despite poor reviews and an unpromising time slot, the show proved very successful. According to Bonnie J. Dow, the reason is Dr. Quinn's \\"integration of liberal feminist assumptions with a sentimentalized affirmation of motherhood.\\" In the United States Sarah Ruddick argued in the 1980s for the existence of \\"maternal thinking\\" and Carol Gilligan wrote of women's \\"standard of relationship, an ethic of nurturance, responsibility, and care\\". They may represent a revival of maternal feminist concepts, which Hillary Clinton has perhaps sought to exploit in the political arena. Critics of Gilligan's revived version of maternal feminism say that to assume women are all essentially mothers, and that a male culture should be replaced in schools by a female culture, are both debatable in a democracy with diverse views about gender, sexuality and maternal roles. The term has also been used in the different sense of feminism as it applies to mothers. Dr. Andrea O‚ÄôReilly of York University in Toronto said at a 2011 Women‚Äôs Worlds conference in Ottawa, Canada that feminist mothering must focus on things that are denied to women by patriarchal motherhood. Feminist mothers must take control of their lives and act according to their own beliefs rather than society's expectations.

The Cistern of Aetius is located in the northern part of the city, southeast of the Gate of Charisius. The Cistern of Aetius () was an important Byzantine water reservoir in the city of Constantinople. Once one of the largest Byzantine cisterns, it is now a football stadium in Istanbul. Since 1928 it has been known as Eyice (1955), p. 71. or , while in the Ottoman period it was known as the . Location The cistern is located in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih (the walled city), in the neighborhood of Karag√ºmr√ºk, about southeast of the Gate of Edirne (the Byzantine Gate of Charisius, later known as Gate of Adrianople) of the city walls, along Fevzi Pa≈üa Caddesi.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 278Janin (1964), p. 203 It lies at the upper end of the valley which divides the fifth and the sixth hills of Constantinople. History The Karag√ºmr√ºk Stadium seen from the west. Behind the trees it is possible to see the remains of the walls of the Cistern. Although according to a late tradition, the erection of the cistern, which lay in the fourteenth region of Constantinople, dates back to the reign of Emperor Valens (r. 364‚Äì78), it is ascertained that it was built in 421 by Aetius, praefectus urbi in Constantinople in 419 and praefectus praetorio Orientis in 425, under Emperor Theodosius II (r. 408‚Äì50). The cistern was confused in scholarship for a long time with the cistern of Bonus or with that of Aspar: only in recent times has its identification become certain. The giant tank was oriented parallel to one branch of the Mese, the main road of the city which connected the Gate of Charisios with the center of the city passing near the Church of the Holy Apostles, and was supplied by the water main connected to the Valens Aqueduct. Due to its huge dimensions, in the Byzantine age the reservoir was often used as reference point to locate other buildings, like the monasteries of Prodomos of Petra, of the Romans () and of Mara (). After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reported that around 1540 the reservoir was already empty.Janin (1964), p. 204 In the Ottoman period, as its Turkish name √áukurbostan (\\"hollow garden\\") betrays, the structure was used as vegetable garden. Since the 1920s the structure has been turned into a sports ground, and since 1928 it hosts a football stadium, the Karag√ºmr√ºk (or Vefa, from the Vefa S.K. football team) stadium, which is the home stadium of Fatih Karag√ºmr√ºk SK team. Identification problem Attempts to identify the location of the Cistern of Aetius started quite late. The cistern has been successively identified with a cistern located near the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (), and now disappeared; the cistern located in the court of the little Kefeli Mosque; the vaulted cistern located southeast of the √áukurbostan of the Gate of Adrianople and known as Zina Yokusu Bodrumi. The key to the eventual establishment of its location lay in the information that the Cistern of Aetius was located near the monastery of Prodomos of Petra, which was surely in the valley dividing the fifth and the sixth hills: this led to its identification with the √áukurbostan near the Gate of Adrianople. Description The cistern has a rectangular plan with huge dimensions, being long and wide: its average depth lies between and . Its capacity was about of water. Its walls, thick and partially still in place, were built according to the Roman constructive technique named opus listatum by alternating four courses of bricks and ten courses of stone, an elegant pattern similar to that used by the cistern of Aspar.Mamboury (1953), p. 325 It has been hypothesized that this reservoir was used to supply with water the moat of the city walls, but it is more plausible that it was a central reservoir whence the water was distributed in the city.

Club career Born in Daugavpils, Labuts career started in Ditton Daugavpils, being a member of the youth system since 2002. After five years, in 2007, at the age of 16, he was invited to join the Latvian Higher League newcomers BlƒÅzma Rƒìzekne. Initially, he was the club's third-choice keeper, later that season he became the second choice. Labuts made his debut for BlƒÅzma on 8 November 2008 in a 2-2 draw against Vindava Ventspils for the Latvian First League. In summer of 2009 Labuts moved abroad, joining the League of Ireland Premier Division club Sporting Fingal. After six months, with the Irish club unable to pay the requested transfer fee for a further stay, Labuts returned to Latvia. In January 2010, he joined the Latvian First League club FB Gulbene, helping them win the league and earn a promotion to the Latvian Higher League for the 2011 season. For the next two seasons Labuts played in the top tier of Latvian football, but after Gulbene's relegation in 2012, he switched clubs and moved to the incumbent Latvian champions Daugava Daugavpils at the beginning of 2013. Serving as a back-up keeper for half a season, Labuts was loaned out to Il≈´kstes NSS in July 2013 in order to retain playing practice. Before the start of the 2014 season, Labuts joined the Latvian Higher League club FC J≈´rmala. After the club was struck by financial problems, he was let go and eventually ended up in Portugal, joining the Portuguese Segunda Liga club Atl√©tico CP. On 9 August 2014 Labuts made his professional debut with Atl√©tico in a Segunda Liga match against Freamunde. In September 2017 the FAI banned Labuts and teammate Dragos Sfrijan for 12 months after a UEFA investigation found \\"clear and overwhelming betting evidence\\" of fixing of Athlone's 29 April match against Longford Town in the 2017 League of Ireland First Division. The Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland said the decision was based on \\"half-baked innuendo\\". Labuts' appeal against his suspension was rejected in October 2018. Labuts moved to Latvia's First League to FC New Project in 2019.

It tells the story of an expedition from Earth (which is in the throes of an arms race) to a planet of the star Altair ‚Äî a planet called Ryn, inhabited by humans like those on Earth. Against the wishes of Ryn's inhabitants, the team from Earth seek information about weapons technology used in an ancient space war. Their unsuccessful search ends in dramatic contact with another species, the ancient enemy of Ryn. The novel was first published in 1960 by Torquil Books and belongs to a class of novels which add a darker tone to the popular tradition of space opera.Clute, John. \\"Hamilton, Edmond.\\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. John Clute, David Langford, Peter Nicholls and Graham Sleight, Eds. Gollancz, 31 July 2014. Web. 26 Aug. 2014. It has been published in English, German, Italian, and Portuguese. Plot The action takes place in an imagined future a few years after the time of writing. Tension between the US and the Soviet Union remains high. Both nations have landed on the Moon, and established bases there. Just under half the length of the novel tells how a discovery on the Moon brings Massachusetts linguist, Robert Fairlie to a high-security space base in New Mexico and eventually to the planet Ryn. The remainder of the novel is about what happens on Ryn after Fairlie and his companions arrive: their contact with some of the inhabitants of the planet, and later with Ryn's ancient enemy, the \\"shadowed ones\\". =From Massachusetts to Ryn= Why would an organization exploring the Moon need the services of a specialist in ancient languages? Professor Robert Fairlie of Massachusetts University ponders that question when he is shanghaied and taken to Morrow Base, America's spaceport, in New Mexico. At Morrow, with three other linguists drafted into the project, he learns that an American expedition to Gassendi crater has made a discovery which US authorities are keeping secret ‚Äî machinery, documents and speech recordings left over from a battle thirty thousand years before. The four men have been brought to Morrow to translate the extraterrestrial language. They're to be supervised by the urbane Nils Christensen, chief of the Lunar Project, and the tightly wound and demanding Glenn DeWitt, whose background is military. The secrecy surrounding the project has to do with the arms race ‚Äî it is considered most important that secrets of advanced extraterrestrial technology will not fall into the wrong hands. Acting on a playful hunch, Fairlie discovers that the language of the ancient Moon base has remarkable similarities to Sumerian and he begins translating the material brought from Gassendi. The accuracy of Fairlie‚Äôs tentative translation is validated by a test of two super-powerful ion engines taken from a wrecked ship in Gassendi, a test in which DeWitt demonstrates his reckless character by ordering one of the engines turned on while there are people outside the bunker. Confident in his hypothesis, Fairlie translates more documents and discovers that the extraterrestrials called themselves Vanryn and came from Ryn, the third planet of Altair. Their bases on the Moon and elsewhere fought a losing battle against an enemy whom the documents don't describe in detail, but imply was not human ‚Äî an enemy determined to stop human beings from travelling in space ever again. Meanwhile a biologist discovers that the Vanryn were the same species as modern humans on Earth ‚Äî that modern Earth people are actually the descendants of Vanryn colonists. With the translations that Fairlie and his colleagues produce, scientists and engineers (still working in secret) recreate the Vanryn machines, and then they build a starship. With Christensen in command and DeWitt, who hopes to find Vanryn super-weapons, as second in command, Fairlie and a team of others ride the ship towards Ryn. While the ship flies through hyperspace, they suffer nightmares about the Vanryn's mysterious enemies. On Ryn they land their ship next to the slagged remains of a once-great starport and the decayed ruins of the city that had stood by it, surrounded by forest. =Contact with the Vanryn and their enemy= In the brush-covered ruins they make contact with one of the inhabitants of Ryn, a young woman called Aral who is curious about the spacecraft. Fairlie discovers to his astonishment that she can understand him, that the Vanryn language has remained much the same for three hundred centuries. (He learns later that this is because the Vanryn have kept playable recordings of their ancestors' songs and speeches.) Even so, the party from Earth find it difficult to establish relations with the local people, most of whom avoid them. Not even the adventurous Aral wants to stay and talk. An argument develops among the Earth people about how to deal with the elusive Vanryn. DeWitt wants to capture and question local people like Aral to get what he expects to be vital military information. Fairlie and Christensen angrily oppose such strong-arm methods. During the argument, Christensen has a heart attack which eventually kills him. DeWitt then takes command. He leads a small exploration party (including Fairlie) which pursues Aral and her male companion Thrayn towards their community. It is a city overgrown with vegetation, with limited technology and only the simplest of weapons. Fairlie learns, from Aral and Thrayn, that people on Ryn still remember and fear their enemy in the ancient war, whom they name as the Llorn, and also call \\"the shadowed ones\\". They think that the arrival of the Earth spacecraft will draw the Llorn's attention. Aral and Thrayn are different from the others, more interested in the achievements of their spacefaring ancestors; although they share their neighbours' fear of the Llorn. They are rejected by their neighbours for revealing the community's location to the Earth people, and become reluctant helpers of DeWitt's expedition. A passing mention by Thrayn of the Hall of Suns gives DeWitt a glimmer of hope that his quest for advanced weapons will bear fruit. As the team approaches the mountain into which the Hall is carved, Aral becomes white with fear, but DeWitt will not let her go. The Hall of Suns turns out to be an ancient monument to the glory of Vanryn expansion through the stars. Although it seems clear that the space is purely ceremonial, DeWitt compels his team to keep looking for the military technology that he expects to find there. Then another spacecraft arrives, surrounded by shadow, a hallmark of the Llorn. Aral and Thrayn try to run away. DeWitt grabs them. While DeWitt and Thrayn are grappling, Aral stabs DeWitt dead with a stolen knife, and flees with Thrayn. The Llorn then begin to speak to the Earth expedition, using the Vanryn language. Fairlie, who is the only member of the expedition who speaks Vanryn, goes to meet them. The Llorn tell Fairlie that they know his people come from Earth, are descendants of the ancient Vanryn, and have violated the Llorn's ban on Vanryn space flight. They go on to state the reasons for the ancient war. Llorn do not colonise other planets, because they value the diversity of intelligent life which evolution naturally produces on different worlds. The Vanryn, in their spacefaring days, valued only their own species, set up colonies on other worlds, and thereby prevented evolution from taking its natural course. To show what they mean about evolutionary diversity, the Llorn lift the veil of shadow that surrounds them, revealing their physical forms ‚Äî they are two-legged, two-armed humanlike beings, but their bodies differ in several visible ways from those of Earth people ‚Äî for instance, they don't have necks. They tell Fairlie that they have decided not to go to war with Earth, even though Earth people have begun to fly to other stars. They simply want to warn Earth people not to repeat the vainglorious and ultimately self-defeating behaviour of their Vanryn ancestors. The story ends with Fairlie and his companions about to return to Earth, uncertain how the message from the Llorn will be received. Reception Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction in 1963 rated the novel 4.5 stars out of five, stating that \\"Hamilton was extra careful with his story ending and you should be, to [sic]. It's loaded\\". John Clute, a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, found the Haunted Stars \\"well-characterized\\", and thinks it is probably the best of a group of Hamilton novels which, \\"though in the space opera tradition\\", are \\"more carefully composed and darker in texture\\" than other works by the same author. Science fiction novelist Dan Moore describes the Haunted Stars as \\"a timeless cautionary tale\\". He writes that fifty years after its first publication, the Haunted Stars remains a \\"thought-provoking\\" work, which \\"explores the friction between scientific inquiry and the use of technology for military ends\\" and \\"raises profound questions about humanity‚Äôs behavior when confronted with an alien culture\\". According to M. Harold Page of Black Gate magazine, the Haunted Stars was written at the point when Edmond Hamilton's writing career overlaps with that of Arthur C Clarke. \\"The theme plus the real-world political setting makes it sit well next to Rendezvous with Rama, Childhood's End, and 2001.\\" The book was also reviewed by *H.H.

The male children of a deceased Tongchangya father divide the property equally among themselves. The daughters cannot claim any share of the property except when they have no brothers. If the deceased father has no children, an adopted son inherits all the property. If a wife is separated when she is pregnant and if she gives birth to a male child, he will inherit her ex-husband's property.

It premiered April 21, 1961 in Venice. Another performance occurred at Warsaw Autumn in 1961. Venetian Games is usually considered the first piece of Lutos≈Çawski's mature period. Inspired by John Cage, Venetian Games is notable for its use of limited aleatory techniques. In Venetian Games, Lutos≈Çawski determined the overall form and harmonic boundaries, yet he left the realization of the exact contrapuntal and harmonic details up to chance in performance. The indeterminate character produces aleatoric counterpoint, which is a type of sound mass. The score of the first movement contains eight boxed musical events labeled A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H. Sections A, C, E, and G function as a refrain. Four percussion instruments signal the beginning of these sections, which are composed of lively un-metered lines played by woodwinds. Each subsequent refrain adds instrumentation. Thus, Section C utilizes woodwinds and 3 timpani; Section E utilizes woodwinds, 3 timpani, and 3 brass instruments; and Section G utilizes woodwinds, 3 timpani, 3 brass instruments, and piano. Except for section E, each subsequent refrain adds duration in multiples of 6 seconds. Thus, the durations for each section are: A-12\\", C-18\\", E-6\\", and G-24\\". Sections B, D, F, and H function as contrasting interludes. Similar to the refrains, percussion instruments signal the beginning of these sections, which are composed of static soft string clusters. Another notable feature of this composition is Lutos≈Çawski's hallmark use of a twelve-tone chord. Lutos≈Çawski's twelve-tone chords are symmetrical and often use a limited number of intervals. For example, the woodwind pitches of section A contain 12 notes and exhibit the following intervallic structure from bottom to top: 23222 / 5 / 22232. Thus, such aleatoric counterpoint produces a special type of sound mass in which the full chromatic spectrum is not covered. Rather than a tone cluster, listeners can hear the twelve-tone chords as a symmetrically spaced chord.

It was built about 1848, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The boundaries of the property include the historic Piqua Road, County Road 100E and the creek (Caffee Legal Drain) The 1.67-acre home site is located on a knoll overlooking an expansive field of rich river bottomland of the St. Marys River. Federal \\"I\\" house The primitive Federal I-house with Greek Revival details is a two-story masonry house with a gable roof and a rear masonry ell extension off of the west front room. On the east side of the ell was a porch. The porch was enclosed as a kitchen and a bedroom addition was built northeast side of the home between 1925 and 1931. Arnold Weidler who lived in the home during the construction provided this information to the author, Julie K. O'Beirne. =Structure= The entire structure, both exterior and interior walls are of three brick thick common bond brick walls including a brick foundation and cellar. The structure prior to 1925 had only one timber-framed wall. That wall is the partition wall of the front foyer/stairwell, which divides the west front room from the foyer. In 1925 when the porch was enclosed the walls were framed with standard 2x4 wood studs 16 inches OC. The framed edition of 1925 was extended 8 feet in 1995 to meet the garage that was built on the property in 1993. The front elevation has 10 symmetrical openings on the first and second floors, five windows on the second story and two windows on each side of the front door. The lintels and sills are all limestone in the masonry structure. The replacement windows are six-over-six double hung units matching identically the original wood window intact in the east side of the masonry ell. This window in the east side of the masonry ell is one of six windows with rough-hewn wood lintels and sills. The other four are the attic windows. In addition are two small single pane cellar windows with two brick window wells. The three panel walnut front door has a three-pane transom ventilation window. The 7/12-pitched roof was originally shake shingles and is now finished in asphalt shingles with large flush end chimneys. The large wooden soffit has a massive decorative cornice that is consistent in size and presentation on the masonry walls as well as the wood framed walls on all elevations of the home. Common Bond is an arrangement of four to six stretcher courses between single header courses. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs West side The west gable end of the \\"I\\" house and west side of the ell is one wall as indicated by the continuous brick pattern present from roof to foundation. This would indicate that the ell was integral part of the design and original construction. A cellar door is the only opening in the west gable end of the \\"I\\" house. The west portion of the ell has two openings a door and a window. The lintel and sill is limestone. The window is six-over-six double hung. North side The north side of the home shows the masonry structure with a chimney and the framed porch enclosure and bedroom addition that was initiated in 1925 as well as the north gable side of the garage built in 1993. The large wooden soffit has a massive decorative cornice that is consistent in size and presentation on the masonry walls as well as the wood-framed walls on all elevations of the home. There are two windows that are vinyl-clad wood, with the sash being six-over-six double hung. The west side of the wood-framed bedroom addition from 1925 and garage from 1993 can be seen with 4-inch vinyl lap siding. One door opening exists in the north side of the framed area. An attic window opening is centered in the gable end of the north side of the garage. East side The east view of the house shows the original masonry construction on the southeast portion of the structure as well as the framed bedroom addition initiated in 1925 and garage built in 1993 on the northeast portion with 4-inch vinyl lap siding. There are two openings in the home: a window opening and a door opening in the framed addition. The window is vinyl-clad wood with the sash being six-over-six double hung. The large wooden soffit has a massive decorative cornice that is consistent in size and presentation on the masonry walls as well as the wood-framed walls on all elevations of the home. Interior The interior of the Lenhart Farmhouse is a perfectly symmetrical Federal \\"I\\" House design with a central three-story walnut staircase and balustrade from the first floor to the attic. The east, west and ell room interior dimensions are . Typical finishes include plaster and simple woodwork. Chair rails are found throughout the first floor \\"I\\" House rooms. The ash floorboards are of irregular widths from 4 to 8 inches wide. The walnut mopboards and quarter round are simply stated finishes to the plank floors. The interior doors on the first floor are three-panel walnut, and the exterior doors are two-panel poplar structurally designed with wooden pegs. All door jams and trim are poplar. The east fireplace is intact, with a large unadorned walnut mantle with only simple moldings. The west fireplace has been bricked and plastered over; none of the mantle remains. From evidence of the craftsmanship and plaster, it is conjecture by the author that the east fireplace was covered at the time of the c. 1925 enclosure of the porch. A stove access in the ell room has been bricked and plastered and a stove removed from that room in 1991. The walnut staircase and balustrade starts in the front hall with a heavy turned newel post that goes through the ash plank flooring secured onto a heavy rough hewn beam in the cellar ceiling. The staircase has four landings: one at the second and attic floors and two located between floors. Windows are located on two of the four landings providing bountiful light and a stunning view north and south of the property. The railing is carved in sections gracefully turning at each landing and finally ending in the attic. The attic flooring is of milled 1-inch oak up 18 inches in width. The floor and ceiling joists are all of milled oak 2 inches √ó 8 inches and 2 inches √ó 4 inches, respectively. The porch that was enclosed in c. 1925 is a 9-foot √ó 18-foot kitchen. The bedroom addition of c. 1925 was renovated c. 1955 as a rear hall and full bath. The bath has a reproduction Victorian claw and ball tub installed in 2018. In 1998 an 8-foot extension connected the home with the garage and a utility room, coat closet and half bath were added. The custom doors in the addition are all four-panel with custom milled trim sympathetic to the \\"I\\" house woodwork and mopboards. Second Floor The second-floor bedrooms symmetrically located on the east and west sides of the \\"I\\" house are identical in size and proportion, . They each have random-width plank floors. A dividing wall partition was added in 1991 providing symmetrical 5-foot √ó 15-foot closet area in each room and a full bath in the east room. The bath remodeled in 2012 with distressed cherry cabinetry and a claw tub. The two panel walnut doors, hardware and trim used for the closets were salvaged from a timber-framed home c. 1870 that was demolished on Winchester Road in Preble Township in Adams County in 1991. The Cellar The cellar floor was replaced in 1995. At that time it was determined that the brick walls were continuous foundation walls. A walnut cellar stair begin with a landing under the first-floor staircase near the kitchen and descends into the cellar. The last tread of the original cellar stair was removed due to water damage, and the remaining stringer was repaired with an oak stringer extension with oak risers and treads. Creek The creek was historically known as \\"Lenhart‚Äôs Run\\" as cited 1918 in the Adams County Commissioners records. The creek is a natural tributary of the St Marys River. The Native Americas called the river \\"Nameewa Siipiiwi\\" in the Myaamia (Miami) language meaning, Sturgeon River. The proximity of the Lenhart Farm to the St. Marys River and Lenhart's Run provided the rich agricultural soil. Historically this location was prized as \\"Bottomland of the first quality.\\" The home sits on a knoll overlooking the watershed of the river. The dwelling site is located on what we now know as the 500-year flood plain. The creek is now known as \\"Caffee Legal Ditch.\\" Native American trail that became Piqua Road Certainly one of the oldest roads in continuous use in Indiana, Piqua Road is thought to be a prehistory game trail around the \\"Great Black Swamp\\" of Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana. The trail is indicated on \\"Map of the Country about the Mississippi\\" attributed to, Chegeree of the Myaamia (Miami) who says he traveled through the country c. 1755. Size of the original hand drawn map is 16-1/4\\" x 13\\" and located at the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress in Washington DC. Other notable maps are Partie Occidentale de la Nouvelle France ou Canada 1755 and Neueste Karte Ohio 1845. The Piqua Road follows the East Side of the St. Marys River for many miles. \\"It was an animal path. The animals instinctively followed the high ground and found the best route free of swamps and swales, sink holes and quicksand bottoms. Then, in time, it was used by the Indians and when the white folks came there was a trail already made for them and the Piqua Road came into being.\\" This route connected the Three River's area of Fort Wayne, Indiana to an important area in Ohio called \\"Pickawillainy\\" that was a trading post or fort erected by traders in 1749. A portion of Piqua Road was also known as the \\"Wayne Trace.\\" This road was one of the routes of travel that supplied the troops garrisoned at Fort Wayne after General Anthony Wayne defeated the Myaamia (Miami) at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. The following year near Piqua, Ohio The Treaty of Greenville, regarded as one of the most important Native American treaties, was signed on August 3, 1795 between the United States and the Miami Confederacy. In 1853 Samuel L. Rugg, simultaneously the Adams County Recorder and County Clerk and of Joseph D. Nuttman a prominent local businessman proposed building a 30-mile plank road through Adams County connecting Fort Wayne and Wilshire, OH. Therefore, the Fort Wayne and Piqua plank road was born. \\"There were certain specific specifications that must be adhered to. Some of which were that nothing but number one clear white oak plank should be used, without knot or knot holes, eight feet long, three inches thick and twelve inches in width, be laid side by side snugly and chummily. Stringers to be laid underneath and to be four by fours and of the same quality oak.\\" This 16‚Äô wide plank toll road served Adams County until about 1862. It had fallen into such disrepair that they discontinued collecting toll in 1866. The origin of the name Piqua (pronounced Pe-quaw) comes from \\"The Legend of Otath-he-wagh-Pe-Qua.\\" George C. Johnston, a trader for many years among the Indians and a member of the Shawnee tribe, explained the origin of the name Piqua. He was told by a member of the tribe, that many years ago the whole tribe was assembled at an annual feast and thanksgiving. They were all seated around a large fire, which having burned down to embers, a great puffing was observed in the ashes. Suddenly, a full- formed man sprang up from the remains of the fire and the tribe exclaimed in astonishment \\"Otaht-he-wagh-Pe-Qua.\\" (He has come out of the ashes) And from that time, that place was called Piqua.\\" Owners and property history A patent on this property was issued in 1836 from President Andrew Jackson of the United States Government to Benjamin Franklin Blossom of Van Wert County, Ohio. Benjamin Franklin Blossom was a young man of 16 years when he migrated West with his parents and siblings from Monmouth, Maine to east bank of the St. Marys River across from Wilshire, OH. in 1822. Fourteen years later at the age of 30, B.F. Blossom purchased the subject tract of land in Root Township in Adams County, IN. The Blossom family has a rich history in the European exploration and settlement of this country. This family can be traced back to the Plymouth church at Leyden, Holland through the first known ancestor, Deacon Thomas Blossom (1580‚Äì1632) who was a leader of the above named church in Holland. The family is of purely English descent, having come from Plymouth, England at the time of the Pilgrim emigration to America. Thomas Blossom was on the Speedwell when she started out with the Mayflower in 1620. The Speedwell, however, sprang a leak and those on board were compelled to return to England. Later Thomas Blossom started again for America and landed on Plymouth Rock in 1629. That the family has among their ancestors a lineal descendant from a Plymouth Pilgrim, Thomas Blossom, and a Captain of the Revolutionary War, James Blossom, is a highly prized distinction. They are connected with the early religious movements of this country and its educational history as well as the establishment of the American Independence and the preservation of the Republic during the days of the Civil War, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and later the World Wars. Captain James Blossom was a direct descendant in the fifth generation from Deacon Thomas Blossom and had a son by the name of Ansel Blossom. Ansel Blossom was born at Cape Cod, Kennebeck County, Maine, in 1778. While living in Maine Ansel taught school for a living. Ansel Blossom was married to Mercy Ladd in 1803. To this union were nine sons and two daughters. In 1822 he emigrated from Monmouth, Maine with his family to the West and entered and settled on a tract of land on the east bank of the St. Marys River across from Wilshire, OH. Ansel was a typical pioneer and faced the conditions, struggled with the difficulties, and endured the hardships of a new and undeveloped country. He filled his place in the rude society and served as the first Justice of the Peace in his new home bent his energies toward the improvement and raising of his family. The third son of Ansel Blossom was Benjamin Franklin Blossom who was born in Maine in 1806 and died in Decatur, Indiana in 1875. In 1836 Benjamin Franklin Blossom at the age of 30 was issued the patent on the property in question which is located 1.5 miles from Monmouth, Indiana. There were subsequent sales and purchases by B. F. Blossom of several tracts of land in Root Township as documented in the Adams County Auditor's office. Clearly B. F. Blossom was instrumental in the settlement of Adams County Indiana which was founded in 1836 and it is conjecture of the officer that Benjamin Franklin Blossom named the oldest town in Adams County, Monmouth after Monmouth, Maine from whence his parents and siblings emigrated in 1822. Monmouth, Indiana, is located in Root Township, Adams County Indiana and was laid out and the plat recorded on June 26, 1836. Benjamin Franklin Blossom served as the first elected School commissioner of Adams County in 1837 continuing in his father's vocation and service to learning and education. It was the school commissioner's responsibility to look after the common school revenues of the county and the examinations of the teachers as well as other duties. B. F. Blossom also served as Postmaster at Decatur from 1869 until his death in 1875. On November 4, 1845, a warranty deed was recorded for the purchase of the tract of land in question from Benjamin Franklin Blossom to John Lenhard. John and his wife Rebecca (Burl) moved their family to the property which was then in its wild state. They had ten children Lawson, John, Sarah, Peter, Catherine, Mary and Elizabeth (twins), Joseph, Ann and William. There were no improvements on the place and the family camped out two weeks beside a large oak log while a cabin was being built. It was made of round logs and scotched down on the inside, a puncheon floor, clapboard roof and a mud fireplace. They lived in this house while John built the brick dwelling that is now standing on the site. John was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania of February 24, 1797 and died May 18, 1877 in Decatur at the age of eighty years and three months. John spelled his name \\"Lenhard\\" even though perhaps it was mispronounced and in some publications misspelled leading to some confusion. Clearly Mr. Lenhard maintained this spelling in his adult life. This is illustrated when at the age of 68 he ran a lost and found advertisement in the Decatur Eagle newspaper published on Friday September 1, 1865. The advertisement read: \\"LOST. On Monday the 28th ult, between the residence of Dr. Trout and my own in Root township, a large old style calf skin pocket book, containing $55 in national currency, $5 of which was an Indiana bill, besides a small amount of postage currency. There were also a few papers but I am under the impression that none of them contained my name and residence. A reward of $5 will be paid for the return of the pocket book and contents. JOHN LENHARD.\\" John and his wife Rebecca attended Alpha church and were buried in the Alpha cemetery two miles north of their home at the southwest corner of the intersection of county roads 100E and 900N. The Alpha church was a log structure built in 1840 and was the first church in the township. All remnants of the church are long since gone but Ted Fuller, the former owner of the property south of the churchyard, remembers the cornerstones that served as the foundation stones of the log structure near the center of the property. The headstone of the Lenhards is intact but in the end John and Rebecca were laid to rest with the name spelled \\"Lenhart\\" as their children and grandchildren spelled the name. Their resting-place and headstone can still be seen in the northwest corner of the rural cemetery near a great oak tree. John Lenhart took a full share of the responsibilities and hardships that went with pioneering. Mr. Lenhart was an elected County Commissioner for three years 1842, 1843 and 1844. He was an upstanding member of the agricultural community and was listed as a prominent citizen who was on the roster of the 1854 Agricultural Members. This organization supported an agricultural fair that was successful until the Civil War and then was discontinued. His work ethic and high standards remain a legacy to the community. His prodigy continued in civil and public service; Joseph his son a veteran of the Civil war, and John Henry Lenhart his grandson a prominent attorney. John H. was eulogized by the Adams County Bar association: \\"Whereas it has pleased the Supreme Judge of the Universe to remove from our midst our brother, companion, and fellow citizen, John H. Lenhart, it is resolved that in his death we have sustained a loss which we deeply deplore. As an officer of this court for eight years he was honest, upright and had ever in his mind the duties and responsibilities of his trust. As an attorney of this bar since the 7th day of October 1898 he was ever faithful and true to his clientage. Discharging the duties of his calling to the best of his knowledge and ability. As a citizen he was ever kind and courteous, leading a pure and open life, always ready to lend a helping hand to the needy and poor.\\" E. Burt Lenhart the son of John H. Lenhart was also an attorney being a member of the firm Hooper & Lenhart and became one of the organizers of the Decatur Abstract & Loan Company. E. Burt Lenhart's biography in the Standard History of Adams and Wells Counties Indiana written by Tyndall and Lesh in 1918 clarifies the history of his great great grandfather John Lenhard's name evolved from Lenhard to Lenhart when his children and grandchildren changed the spelling of the name. John Lenhart built a model farm in the rough and undeveloped territory of Root Township. The following is quoted from the Abstract of Title concerning the real estate description for the purpose of the Lenhart Executor's sale. \\"The undersigned would further state that the above land constitutes what is known as the Lenhart farm, on the North bank of the St. Marys River about a mile from Decatur. The farm has upon it a good brick dwelling, a good orchard, a frame barn, corncribs and other outbuildings. It has never failing springs, also a sand and gravel back upon it; also a stone quarry, in the bed of the river. This farm is mostly bottomland of the first quality.\\" Nimrod Dailey and his wife Rosannah purchased the property for $11, 500.00 and a mortgage was recorded on October 11, 1880. Mr. Dailey had the property for only six years until his death on February 5, 1886. At that time in 1886 Rosannah maintained ownership of the property but she and her three children, Anna M., Jesse D. and Mary O. moved from their farm to the city of Decatur. The children continued to own the property subsequent their mother's death in January 1919. The last heir of the family to own the property was Nimrod's grandson Harry Daniel Dailey and his wife Louise. The Dailey family owned the property for 83 years but for only six years did Nimrod Dailey and his family farm the property. The additional 77 years that the farm remained in the family the land and house was occupied by tenants. Dailey family eventually sold the house but kept the tillable acreage. A tenant of the home was Fred Weidler, who rented the home from 1925 to 1931. It was between 1925 and 1931 that Fred Weidler enclosed the back porch of the original structure to use as a kitchen and built an addition to the house to serve as a bedroom. These facts were given to the author Julie K. O'Beirne orally by Arnold Weidler the son of Fred Weidler who presented several photographs of the property which include an excellent photographic history of the brick structure, the bedroom addition. On the photographs are Arnold Weidler and his twin brothers Paul and Wilfred. On October 7, 1963, John and Letha Hutchison purchased the brick home with approximately 6 acres on the north side of Piqua Road and a warranty deed was recorded in Adams County IN. The ownership of the home and 6-acre site was transferred again when a warranty deed was recorded February 13, 1968, to Clois D. and Winona F. Eichar and a mortgage was recorded in the amount of $4441.18. Neither of these owners significantly changed the brick home. However, during the ownership of the Eichers the remaining outbuildings on the home site fell into disrepair and they demolished them. A building that was destroyed was a well-known milk house built near the spring on the north side of the home. The spring water was run into the milk house and the continuous stream of cool water chilled the milk. On July 20, 1991, Julie K. Sheets O‚ÄôBeirne purchased at the Eicher estate sale 1.67 acres which included the brick home, orchard and spring from the original homesite. The home had been unoccupied for several years and was in a distressed condition. O‚ÄôBeirne was responsible for the delicate, sympathetic restoration of the historic home as a functional residence. Significant changes to the property or structure since 1991 include: garage built in 1993, replaced concrete floor in the cellar 1995, kitchen, bath, utility area extended 8‚Äô to the garage in 1998 and horse stable built in 2000.Standard History of Adams and Wells Counties Indiana, Tyndall & Lesh 1918 Snows History of Adams County Indiana, Snow 1907 A Short, Short, Story of Adams County Indiana, Quinn 1936 Abstract of Title No. 2926, United Abstract Company, Inc. 1968 Survey, William Wemhoff 1999 The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, Rafert 1996 Another America: Native American Maps and the History of Our Land, Mark Warhus 1997 Yearbook of German-American Studies Volume 38 \\"Herman Zagel's Jack Roostand A German-American View of Prairie Life\\", Giles R.

Gameplay A City Sleeps is a horizontally scrolling twin-stick shooter. The player controls Poe, a dream exorcist that enters the nightmares of the citizens of SanLo City to help free them of a force that controls the city. The player moves Poe around the screen with one controller stick and aims her weapon with the other to dodge the torrent of bullets the nightmare forces fire at her and defeat them with her own weapon. The player can also move Poe close to a foe, risking more damage from their bullets but allowing Poe to defeat the foe with a sword, which helps to build a special meter. Once this meter is full, the player can then trigger a special attack that affects all the enemies on the screen. The patterns of the appearance of enemies and when they fire are tightly connected to the game's soundtrack, reflecting on Harmonix' past expertise in rhythm game development. In addition to her own abilities, Poe has a trio of \\"ghosts\\" that accompany her and that can be attached to special nodes located on the levels. Each ghost has a unique ability: one can heal Poe, another can shoot its own bullets, and the third can drain health from enemies trapped nearby. The type of node will affect how these abilities work; for example, the health-generating ghost on some nodes may end up firing health bullets that Poe can take to restore health, while other nodes may create a health restoration field near the node. The player can swap ghosts and nodes at any time, though foes will continue to fire on Poe during this process. Development and release A City Sleeps was developed by a part of Harmonix' team that worked on their first-person music-based shooter, Chroma. The title was revealed at the 2014 PAX Prime convention. Reception A City Sleeps received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

With Aurangzeb Two centuries after 1500, Rajput rulers began to take high positions in Mughal court. Apart from being a ruler he was a fierce warrior too, which led Aurangzeb to give him 1000 cavalry and 4000 infantry and gave him the title of Umar-i-Azam which was high mansab given to Rajput rulers. Battle with Kamal Khan He was engaged in a battle with Kamal Khan, who was Mughal commander of Attock Fort. He killed Kamal Khan in a fierce battle and made the Mughals fear his might.

Attack on Sirhind and killing of Wazir Khan Wazir khan ( Sarkar-i-Sirhind ) was a Mansabdar with 2000 horsemen under Aurangzeb which was much less as compared to a Mansab of 1000 horsemen and 4000 infantry of Sardar Bhagwant Singh ( Sarkar-i-Bangash ), so Wazir Khan's defeat was certain. Sardar Bhagwant Singh along with his seven brothers and Banda Singh Bahadur(whom Guru Gobind Singh sent with them acknowledging him as the Guru's adopted son) made his sword bathe in tyrant's blood and ruined the Mughal rule in Sirhind which was a very big Mughal subah extending from Sutlej to Yamuna.

But now, when they are faced with this horrible tragedy, no one wants to help them, and they are unable to do anything about it. No one listens to them, no one cares, they are simply not important.

Life Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Hasan bin Furak al-Shafi'i al- Ansari al-Isbahani was born in around 941 CE (330 AH) in Isfahan. He studied Ash'arite kalam under Abu 'l-Hasan al-Bahili along with Al-Baqillani and al- Isfara'ini in Basra and Baghdad, and also traditions under 'Abd Allah bin Ja'far al-Isbahani. From 'Iraq he went to Rayy, then to Nishapur, where a madrasa was built for him beside the Khanqah of the Sufi al-Bushandji. He was in Nishapur before the death of the Sufi Abu 'Uthman al-Maghribi in 373/983, and probably remained there until shortly before his death. The Karramiyya tried to have him executed by the Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni but failed after the Sultan summoned him to Ghazni and questioned him then exonerated him of the charges they had brought against him. However, the historical sources differ in determining the cause of his death. One version says that upon returning from Ghazni, he fell on the road, poisoned and died in 1015 CE (406 AH) while another version says that he was attacked from behind. He was carried back to Nishapur and buried in al-Hira. Influences Ibn Furak's works in \\"Usul al- Din\\" (foundation of religion), \\"Usul al-fiqh\\" (foundation of jurisprudence), and the meanings of the Quran count nearly one hundred volumes. Among them are Mujarrad Maq√¢l√¢t al-Ash\`ar√Æ and Kitab Mushkil al-hadith wa-bayanihi (with many variants of the title), in which he refuted both the anthropomorphist tendencies of Hanbali literalists and the over-interpretation of the Mu'tazila. Ibn Furak said that he embarked on the study of kalam because of the had√Æth reported from the Prophet. His main work in the eyes of later generations is Tabaqat al-mutakallimin which is the main source to study al- Ash'ari theology.

Loop 363 then has interchanges with Farm to Market Road 2305 (FM 2305, Adams Avenue) and Airport Road. This is the western terminus of SH 53 and the end of the concurrency with SH 36 which continues to the northwest. After this interchange, the highway runs through sparsely populated areas of the city again. After the intersection with Industrial Boulevard, Loop 363 turns back to the east and runs by a Walmart distribution center and the main Wilsonart plant, before running back to I-35. The stretch between Airport Road and I-35 is under construction as of 2015, varying between freeway grade and unlimited divided highway. This is expected to be completed entirely at freeway grade in 2017. History Loop 363 was designated on June 26, 1962, running from I-35 to US 190. On July 30, 1965, Loop 363 was extended northwestward from I-35 to SH 36. On January 31, 1967, Loop 363 was extended eastward concurrent with US 190 and northward to I-35. On February 25, 1987, Loop 363 was extended from I-35 to SH 36, completing its current route. Junction list Clockwise (CW) reads down and counterclockwise (CCW) reads up.

The film is a modern-day adaptation of the 1871-72 novel La Cur√©e by √âmile Zola. Synopsis In Paris, Maxime Saccard visits his wealthy industrialist father Alexandre and his beautiful young Canadian wife, Ren√©e. Alexandre fathered Maxime years ago in a prior marriage and Maxime has come to stay with them after studying in England. Ren√©e tells Maxime that she married Alexandre when she was pregnant following an unhappy love affair; the child was stillborn and the passion between the two has faded. Ren√©e and Maxime begin an affair and fall in love with each other. Ren√©e, who came from a wealthy family, asks Alexandre for a divorce. He agrees, on the condition that she leaves the fortune she brought to their marriage invested in his business. Ren√©e accepts this and goes to Switzerland for a divorce. But while she is away, Alexandre confronts his son with two alternatives: he can either run off with the now penniless Ren√©e or become engaged to Anne Sernet, the daughter of a wealthy banker whose support Alexandre wants for his business. Maxime agrees on the second course of action. Ren√©e returns from Switzerland to find Alexandre holding a ball celebrating Maxime's engagement to Anne. Ren√©e throws herself into the pool to kill herself ‚Äì but then changes her mind and dripping wet enters the party. Alexandre escorts her to the gymnasium, where she sits and stares into an empty future.

Sernet (uncredited) * Dominique Zardi: Guest (uncredited) Production The movie was one of a series Vadim made based on a classic text. He described the book as \\"about high society in Paris with a rather serious background, since it likens dogs turning on a deer in a hunt to people.\\" \\"I am making no attempt to give the wide sociological picture that Zola did\\", added Vadim. \\"I am not a naturalist or a moralist. The Zola characters were hardly everyday. There was something fantastic about them, though they have their counterparts today, as I hope to show.\\" Vadim and Jane Fonda married immediately prior to making the film. It was only the second film performance of Tina Aumont. The movie was shot in both English and French versions. Fonda acted in French and English. \\"I said it was hard enough to shoot anything once\\", she said. \\"But doing it twice, I found, seemed perfectly natural. \\"I love working in French\\", she added. \\"I feel a certain kind of freedom. The way you feel when you learn to speak a foreign language and find you can say things you wouldn't dare say in English.\\" Peter McEnery did not speak French so when shooting the French version he had to learn his lines phonetically and a French actor was then dubbed in for him. Fonda appears in some nude scenes which were explicit for the time. She said later about shooting these: > You have to be relaxed, free. Pornography begins when things become self- > conscious. But the set was cleared and closed, and I knew Vadim would > protect me in the cutting room. Months later we discovered that a > photographer had hidden in the rafters and taken pictures which he sold to > Playboy. It rocked me, it really did. It's a simple matter of breaking and > entering, and invasion of privacy. Reception The movie was a solid box office success in France, where it received mostly good reviews. It was the tenth most popular movie at the French box office in 1966, after La Grande Vadrouille, Dr Zhivago, Is Paris Burning?, A Fistful of Dollars, Lost Command, A Man and a Woman, For a Few Dollars More, The Big Restaurant and The Professionals. When the film screened at the Venice Film Festival, however, critical reception was hostile. When the movie was screened commercially in Italy later, all copies were seized on the grounds of obscenity. The Italian producer and 23 cinema owners were charged. Vadim and Fonda were not charged. =US Release= The Game Is Over received mostly negative reviews in the US. Critics praised the cinematography by Claude Renoir, but called the film's story and dialogue trite. New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote that the film \\"has absolutely nothing in it but fancy clothes and decor\\", while critic Roger Ebert called it \\"a tedious and ridiculous film of great physical beauty\\". The Washington Post called it 'this deliciously false and phony picture.\\" However the Los Angeles Times called it Vadim's \\"best film since Les Liaisons Dangereuses and the finest of Miss Fonda's career... Rarely has Vadim's style been so expressive.\\" References  External links  * *The Game is Over at TCMDB Category:1966 films Category:French drama films Category:Films based on works by √âmile Zola Category:Films directed by Roger Vadim Category:Films set in Paris Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:English- language French films Category:French-language films ","title":"The Game Is Over"},{"id":"43683133","text":"Yibal Airport is an airport serving the town of Yibal in the Ad Dhahirah Governorate of Oman.

SOS is a public charitable organization which operates through Local Chapter Committees supported by a Provincial Board of Directors and Provincial Executive. Mission Save Ontario Shipwrecks's mission is to study, preserve and promote an appreciation of Ontario's marine heritage. SOS believes in leaving artifacts where found as opposed to preservation in museum collection storage facilities. SOS, was formed in 1981 to change that mentality. ‚ÄúWhen diving really took off in the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s, it was clear to preservationists that something needed to be done to prevent looting,‚Äù Michael Hill, president of SOS recalled. SOS studies Ontario's marine heritage through historical and archival research, oral histories, side scan surveys and underwater archaeological investigations. SOS preserves Ontario's marine heritage through mooring program, site monitoring and documentation activities. The mooring program seeks to minimize anchor damage on sites which are regularly being visited by sport divers. In 2005 SOS created the Dive To Preserve program (www.DiveToPreserve.org) which promotes Marine Heritage preservation through Low Impact diving, site stewardship, and reporting of site conditions. SOS promote an appreciation of Ontario's marine heritage through presentations to scuba training courses, public groups and dive clubs. SOS designs, produces and brings displays about marine heritage to underwater trade shows and conferences which highlight the need for all divers to use shipwreck sites responsibly and minimize the negative impact of their visit. SOS works with the diving tourism industry, from the standpoint of site preservation. SOS lobbies government to develop resource management initiatives which balance study, preservation and use. History SOS was incorporated in February 1981 with Rick Jackson, Andrew Garay and Gain Wong as the first directors. Save Ontario Shipwrecks (SOS)'s first Chapters were Save Ontario Shipwrecks-Toronto in Toronto, Niagara Peterborough and Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Ottawa in Ottawa. Although SOS was originally centered in Toronto, it is currently centered Save Ontario Shipwrecks (SOS) in Blenheim, Ontario. SOS Ottawa Valley, Sault Ste Marie, Superior, London and Sudbury were formed in 1984. In 1985, SOS Quinte, and SOS Oshawa came on board, followed by Ohio in 1986. In 1986, Chapters formed in Windsor, Ingleside (which was closely affiliated with the Lost Villages Historical Society) and Thunder Bay. More recent groups include: *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Hamilton in Hamilton, Ontario *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Central RegionSave Ontario Shipwrecks - Central Region *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Eastern Region *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Huron ShoresSave Ontario Shipwrecks - Huron Shores *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Northern Region Manitoulin *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Port Dover *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Thousand IslandsSave Ontario Shipwrecks - Thousand Islands *Save Ontario Shipwrecks - Windsor In 1986, the Ministry of Culture awarded SOS Core Funding grant, which developed a more structured fiscal operating system, and reorganized to manage day-to-day affairs in a more professional manner. By 1986, SOS had a definite Board of Directors, with Officers and an Executive Committee to manage the day-to-day affairs of the corporation. Projects SOS projects are designed to protect dive sites, and communicate to the public. SOS chapter sponsored projects include plaques, surveys, buoys, underwater sculpture park and scuba diver training through the Nautical Archaeology Society (NAS). =Courses= In 2009, SOS became the licensing authority in Ontario for Nautical Archaeology Society. Courses, which are available across the province, teach and certify participants in a survey of a shipwreck or site. The courses cover how to date a vessel, how to measure a wreck, how to write a report and how to submit it to the government. =Plaques, guides and dive slates= SOS produced Dive Plaques for a number of popular dive sites including: Rothesay, King Horn, Conestoga (ship), Red Pine Bay Shipwreck, Weehawk and 5 Sunken Treasures. The Rothesay (1868), a wooden side wheeler in the St. Lawrence River, west of Prescott collided with the tug Myra and sank on Sept. 12, 1889, was blown up in a munition exercise in 1901 by members of the Royal Military College of Canada and was rediscovered on Sept. 25, 1964 by the Underwater Archeology Society of Ottawa. Save Ontario Shipwrecks, Thousand Island Chapter erected a plaque on the wreck of The King Horn, a two-masted schooner fitted as a barge sank around 1897 near Brockville, Lake Ontario. Unfortunately, two bilge pumps on the deck were damaged by careless use of anchors. The plaque reminds divers who visit the King Horn that Ontario marine heritage is a resource worth conserving. SOS produced Divers‚Äô Guides and Dive Slates for a number of dive sites and wrecks which include the sight layout, history, dive notes and directions: Lillie Parsons, Conestoga, C.B. Benson, Henry C. Daryaw, Keystorm, Kinghorn, Lyman M Davis, Muscallonge, Robert Gaskin, Rothesay, Southern Trail, and Wexford. Dive Slates are field guides made of white styrene plastic that can be written on underwater in pencil. The front has a history of the vessel and an above water image. The back has an underwater plan of the site and dive notes. Lillie Parsons (1868) is a 19th-century Great Lakes centreboard schooner that hit rocks and sank off Sparrow Island, near Brockville August 5, 1877. =Surveys= SOS Quinte was formed in 1985 to explore the Annie Falconer, the wreck of a late-1800s schooner near Picton (Pt. Traverse). SOS Peterborough surveyed the wreck of Stone Lodge in 1985. In 1990, when SOS studied the Mayflower, which was lost November 12, 1912, they used grid wires to section off the ship to allow sector-by-sector photos of the wreck in Kamaniskeg Lake. SOS has explored wrecks which were once rich with artifacts, many of which are now regrettably gone. There remains the ship's stove and wheel of the Prince of Wales (1860)/ the Sligo, a three-masted barque which sank in 1918 near Toronto, Ontario, and was discovered in 1984. SOS Ottawa surveyed in 1988 the wreck of the steamer Conestoga (ship) (1878) a wooden cargo ship that caught fire and sank off Cardinal on May 22, 1922 outside Lock 28 of the Old Galop Canal. SOS surveyed The Mink (1912-1927) / Waome (1927-1934) a wooden steamer which sank in Lake Muskoka, 6 October 1934, just west of Keewaydin Island. SOS explored the W.H. Simpson (1889) /Monarch a steam powered tugboat which sank to the bottom of St. Clair River, south of the Bluewater Bridge in Sarnia, Ontario on July 6, 1934. Many wrecks explored by SOS are not fully intact, unlike the George A. Marsh (1882), a three-masted schooner, which sank on August 8, 1917, during a summer gale off Amherst Island near Kingston, Ontario Sweepstakes Shipwreck in Fathom Five National Marine Park The SOS Ohio chapter explored 22 wrecks in Fathom Five National Marine Park in 1986‚Äì1987, a popular place to snorkel and scuba dive. The Sweepstakes, for example, a two-masted schooner which sank in 1885, lies just below the surface in Big Tub harbor. SOS also explored the wreck of the SS Keystorm (1909‚Äì1910), which struck Scow Island shoal in fog near Alexandria Bay, New York on October 12, 1912. Although SOS generally surveys shipwrecks, chapters also explored The Lost Villages. Guard Lock 21, which was constructed in 1885/86, was flooded in 1936 as headwater for the Hydro dam at Cornwall. Mille Roches Power House (1901) at Cornwall was demolished prior to inundation in 1955 with the new Powerdam and Seaway nearing completion. SOS performs surveys on unidentified wrecks. In June 2013, for example, SOS Ottawa Chapter tentatively named The Locweld Wreck, which rests on the bed of the St. Lawrence River near the former Locweld manufacturing site west of Guidon Park in Cornwall, Ontario. =Buoys= Wreck Of The Metamora SOS's province wide campaign to provide and maintain (80) mooring buoys which make it easy to identify and hold on the dive site, to SOS chapters and affiliated organizations began in 2005.‚ÄúBefore our mooring program, boats would drop anchor and end up pulling part of the wreck with them when they moved,‚Äù said Michael Hill, president of SOS. ‚ÄúNow, the most popular dive sites all have moorings.‚Äù In Georgian Bay, for example, the ship's boiler, which has been painted white and has a channel marker attached to it identifies remains of the wreck of the tug The Metamora, which sank near Pointe au Baril in Georgian Bay in 1907. The upper portion of the steeple engine, which protrudes above the river, marks the site of the Conestoga (ship) (1878), which sunk on May 22, 1922. =Underwater Sculpture Park= SOS has develops underwater parks, which are designed to divert divers from sensitive underwater ecosystems. The Thousand Islands chapter of S.O.S., for example, wants to create an underwater sculpture park in the St. Lawrence River a short distance from Centeen Park in 2014‚Äì15. Students of Thousand Islands Secondary School are creating 6 sculptures representing six people looking up at the river's surface out of concrete and rebar for the park under the supervision of art teacher Dave Sheridan. Sheridan, who is a diver and projects manager for the Thousand Islands S.O.S. chapter was inspired to develop a memorial for all who have perished in the river by diver and artist Jason deCaires Taylor. =Awards= The Save Ontario Shipwrecks Marine Heritage Award is given annually. In 2013, for example, the award was received by Cris Kohl, who is a maritime historian, scuba diver, author, lecturer, photographer, and videographer.

At the MUW Crevenna is a member of the board for handicapped people since 2014.  Scientific contribution  Key areas of Crevenna's scientific and medical work comprise aspects of the so-called medical exercise therapy and especially of the interdisciplinary oncologic rehabilitation from the point of view of medical medicine and rehabilitation. The formation, implementation and management of an oncologic rehabilitation ambulance at the Universit√§tsklinik f√ºr Physikalische Medizin und Rehabilitation as well as the regularly coordination of an interdisciplinary and multi-professional tumor board for oncologic rehabilitation at the MUW (comprehensive cancer center), both bear witness of the growing and fundamental importance of the subject and also of the importance of an optimal, quality based and reliable interdisciplinary and multi-professional cooperation. Actual efforts are medical and organisational aspects at the formation of interdisciplinary offers for oncologic patients complementing the acute care. Proof or counter- proof of traditional contraindication in the physical medicine are also an important part of his research efforts. Examples are the application of different forms of the electrotherapy at recipients of electronic implants or at oncologic patients. Another fixed point are Crevenna's efforts for the method biofeedback, especially for its medical indication. Crevenna could improve the acceptance of this method under medical practitioners. As president of the √ñsterreichische Gesellschaft f√ºr Biofeedback und Psychophysiologie, √ñBFP, Crevenna integrated biofeedback into the curriculum of the MUW, which improved the acceptance of the method under medical practitioners. The formation and management of the first university special ambulance for oncologic rehabilitation and for medical training and medical training therapy as well as the implementation of the first tumor board for oncologic rehabilitation worldwide (comprehensive cancer center) are significant progresses in the interdisciplinary approach of Crevenna's discipline. The results were enabled through the scientific efforts of his team and through the acceptance and support in the interdisciplinary cooperation.

Since early 2017, the U.S. and its partners have also targeted the Syrian government and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs. During the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, the U.S. initially supplied the rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid (e.g. food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, money, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. At least two U.S. programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels, including a 2014 Pentagon program that planned to train and equip 15,000 rebels to fight ISIL, which was canceled in 2015 after spending $500 million and producing only a few dozen fighters. A simultaneous $1 billion covert program called Timber Sycamore ran by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was more successful, but was decimated by Russian bombing, and canceled in mid-2017 by the Trump administration. The Obama administration began surveillance missions on Islamic State positions in Syria in September 2014. On 22 September 2014, the U.S., Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began to attack ISIL forces inside Syria, as well as the Khorasan group in the Idlib Governorate west of Aleppo, and the al- Nusra Front around Raqqa, as part of the international military intervention against ISIL. By late 2015, CJTF-OIR planes were dropping or launching an average of 67 bombs or missiles a day. By August 2017, the coalition had flown 168,000 sorties in both Syria and Iraq (mostly against ISIL). The U.S. missile strike on Shayrat Airbase on 7 April 2017 was the first time the U.S. deliberately attacked Syrian government forces, and marked the start of a series of direct military actions by U.S. forces against the Syrian government and its allies that occurred during the periods of May‚ÄìJune 2017 and February 2018. In mid-January 2018, the Trump administration indicated its intention to maintain an open-ended military presence in Syria to counter Iran's influence and oust Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. In early September 2018, the U.S. began implementing a new strategy that sought to indefinitely extend its military effort, launching a major diplomatic push to achieve American objectives in Syria. However, on 19 December, President Trump unilaterally ordered the withdrawal of the 2,000‚Äì2,500 American ground troops in Syria, which was initially set to take place in a 90-day period, and to be completed in 2019. With proliferating concerns over a potential power vacuum, the U.S. announced on 22 February 2019 that instead of a total withdrawal, a contingency force of around 400 American troops would remain garrisoned in Syria indefinitely, and that their withdrawal would be gradual and conditions- based, marking a return to a policy of open-ended American military presence in the country. By the end of 2018, the SDF, assisted by CJTF-OIR, had liberated over 20,000 square kilometers of territory, and three million Syrian civilians from the Islamic State. In 2019, the coalition saw decisive results in its intervention against ISIL, when it lost its last remaining territory in Syria in the March 2019 Battle of Baghuz Fawqani. ISIL leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi was killed during in a U.S. special forces raid in Barisha, Idlib in October 2019. The Trump administration ordered all U.S. forces to withdraw from Rojava in early October ahead of a Turkish incursion into the region, a controversial move widely seen as a reneging of the U.S.'s alliance with the SDF in favor of NATO ally Turkey. However, the decision was partially reversed by November 2019, as U.S. troops repositioned to eastern Syria, reinforcing their presence in the al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor governorates, with the subordinate mission of securing SDF-controlled oil and gas infrastructure from the ISIL insurgency and the Syrian government. On 23 November 2019, the head of U.S. Central Command stated there was no \\"end date\\" on the U.S.'s intervention in Syria.  Background  United States diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks have been seen as showing that regime change in Syria may have been a covert foreign policy goal of the U.S. government in the years leading up to the civil war, even during the period when President Barack Obama was publicly engaging with Syria's Bashar Al-Assad. A 2006 memorandum by U.S. diplomat William Roebuck of the embassy in Damascus stated: > We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming > issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the > regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This > cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that > there may be actions, statements and signals that the USG can send that will > improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising. These proposals will > need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be > ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities. Many of our > suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send > messages that influence the inner circle. According to Seymour Hersh and activist Robert Naiman, Roebuck, who went on to be charge d'affairs of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria. Following the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, protests in Syria against the Assad administration were violently suppressed and a civil war began. By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the Free Syrian Army, formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces. In 2012, the al-Nusra Front was established by the Islamic State of Iraq as the official branch of al-Qaeda in Syria. The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and al-Qaeda severed its ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle. = Pre-coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition = At the direction of U.S. President Barack Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was put in charge of operations worth about $1 billion annually to arm anti-government forces in Syria, an operation which formally began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011. Prior to 2013, the CIA only supplied certain rebel groups of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid, but later began providing training, funding, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders. Although a former intelligence adviser who spoke to journalist Seymour Hersh claimed the CIA had been facilitating the flow of arms from Libya to Syria in collaboration with \\"the UK [United Kingdom], Saudi Arabia and Qatar\\" since 2012 or 2011, the first confirmed CIA weapons arrived in Spring 2014: \\"There were just a handful, delivered to only one rebel group carefully vetted by the CIA\\". The group, Harakat Hazm, or the Steadfast Movement, showed off the new weapons system by posting the first successful strike on YouTube in April. Another of the groups being vetted was the Islamist Army of Mujahedeen, formed in January 2014 specifically to combat ISIL. However, there were indications that the Army of Mujahedeen was still being vetted in September 2014. In addition to the covert CIA program, on 17 September 2014 the U.S. House of Representatives voted to authorize the executive branch to overtly train and equip Syrian rebels against ISIL forces, at a cost of $500 million. = July 2014 rescue mission = Following the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the U.S. carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. U.S. airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the \\"Osama bin Laden Camp\\" while at the same time, two dozen US special forces soldiers parachuted from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from Raqqa, which started a three-hour firefight. U.S. forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one U.S. soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue. Following the mission, it was still unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission. In the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff on 19 August and 2 September respectively, and Briton David Haines on 13 September. = Surveillance flights over Syria = On 26 August 2014, the U.S. began sending surveillance flights, including drones, over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets. The flights began gathering intelligence that would aid future airstrikes even though airstrikes were not yet authorized at that point. No approval was sought from the Assad government for flights entering Syrian airspace.  U.S.-led coalition against ISIL  The United States had since 2014 led efforts to establish a global coalition to counter ISIL. On 5 September, 15 September and 3 December 2014, various sets of countries came together to discuss concerted action against ISIL. Present at all three meetings were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey and Denmark. The coalition of 5 September (10 countries) decided to support anti- ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria. On 10 September 2014, U.S. president Barack Obama announced a ‚Ä≥comprehensive‚Ä≥ strategy to counter ISIL that ‚Ä≥in concert with coalition partners <...> will defeat ISIL and deny them safe haven‚Ä≥. The coalition of 3 December 2014 (sixty countries) that styled itself as the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) agreed on a many-sided strategy against ISIL, including cutting off ISIL's financing and funding and exposing ISIL's true nature. As of March 2015, the U.S.-led coalition comprised over sixty countries, that contributed in various ways to the effort. =Support for Kurdish-led ground forces= As the Siege of Koban√Æ continued there were growing calls to also arm the YPG, also known as the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish fighting force in Syria heavily involved in the defense of Koban√Æ. On 20 October 2014, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu announced that the Turkish government would be allowing Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government to cross their border into Koban√Æ to support Kurdish fighters. The change in policy came after the Turkish government had refused to allow Kurdish fighters and supplies to pass through the border to YPG units in Koban√Æ, as it viewed the YPG as an offshoot of the PKK. On 28 October, Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government departed Erbil to travel to Turkey and eventually to Koban√Æ. A total of 152 soldiers were deployed starting with forty vehicles carrying weapons, artillery, and machine guns, along with 80 Peshmerga forces, who crossed the border into Turkey by land with the heavy weapons and then drove to the border near Koban√Æ. The other 72 soldiers in the contingent flew to Turkey and rejoined the rest of the contingent on 29 October. By the start of November, 152 Kurdish Peshmerga from Iraq and 50 Free Syrian Army fighters had crossed the border into Koban√Æ with heavy weapons, small arms, and ammunition. On 20 October 2014, the United States began airdropping supplies to Syrian Kurdish forces, including the YPG, that were besieging ISIL-controlled Koban√Æ. Prior to 20 October, the United States and its anti-ISIL coalition partners in Syria had not provided any supplies to Kurdish forces in their fight against the jihadist group. Much of the reason for the U.S. airdropping supplies was due to the Turkish government's refusal to allow supplies to pass through their border into Koban√Æ. The U.S. specifically airdropped weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies supplied by Iraqi Kurdistan intended to supply the Kurdish forces in Syria. On 21 October, a video was released by ISIL showing what it claimed was a bundle of airdropped small arms, ammunition, and other supplies from the United States. The Pentagon said it was analyzing the video and could not at the time confirm whether the video was authentic but that the materials were similar; the video would subsequently be analyzed by the Department of Defense to verify its authenticity. On 22 October, the Pentagon confirmed that one of its airdrops had been intercepted by ISIL elements but downplayed the incident, saying that it most likely would not give ISIL any real advantage in their overall operations. = Coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition = In October 2014, the Turkish government agreed to help train and equip some moderate Syrian rebels in Turkey. By January 2015, the United States was set to send 400 troops and hundreds of support staff to countries neighboring Syria in order to train 5,000 opposition soldiers a year for the next three years. The countries taking part in the train-and-equip program were to include Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as Turkey. The groups that were expected to be armed and trained by the U.S. government included fighters from the Free Syrian Army. The Pentagon confirmed that it had selected 1,200 Syrian opposition members to begin training in March 2015, with 3,000 to complete training by the end of 2015. The successful experience in Koban√Æ had informed U.S. policy in regard to arming Syrian opposition groups other than the Kurdish YPG, with plans to give other groups technicals equipped with radio and GPS equipment to call in airstrikes. John R. Allen, President Obama's envoy to the international coalition against ISIL, stated \\"It is clearly part of our plan, that not only we will train them, and we will equip them with the latest weapons systems, but we will also protect them when the time comes\\". In March 2015, the United Kingdom announced that it was sending around 75 military instructors to train Syrian opposition forces. The train- and-equip program started on 9 May 2015. On 25 May, Turkey and the U.S. agreed \\"in principle\\" on the necessity to support these forces with air support. However, only about 200 rebel fighters actually began training, the majority of whom left after being required to agree to fight only against ISIL and not the Assad government. By mid-2015, only a group of 54 such fighters (Division 30) had been deployed - which was quickly routed in an ambush by al-Nusra - and a further 100 had been thus far finished training in Jordan. In September 2015, it was reported that a further 100-120 were being trained in a second wave, with 75 more Division 30 fighters reported to have re-entered Syria at the end of the month; they were immediately attacked by al-Nusra. Jane's Defence Weekly reported that in December 2015 the U.S. shipped 994 tonnes of weapons and ammunition (including packaging and container weight), generally of Soviet-type equipment from Eastern Europe, to Syrian rebel groups under the ongoing CIA Timber Sycamore operation. A detailed list of weapon types and shipment weights had been obtained from the U.S. government's Federal Business Opportunities website. As of July 2016, extensive arms shipments were continuing. It was reported in July 2017 that the Donald Trump administration decided to \\"phase-out\\" the CIA program to equip and train anti-government rebel groups.

For the first time, he authorized direct attacks against the militant group in Syria. In his address, he said the United States were going on offensive, launching \\"a steady, relentless effort to take out\\" the group \\"wherever they exist.\\" Obama also announced creating of a broader coalition against ISIL. Commenting on Obama's address, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman opposed the U.S. intervention against ISIL in Syria \\"without the consent of the legitimate government\\" and said that \\"this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law\\". Ali Haidar, Syrian minister of national reconciliation, said that \\"any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria\\". On 17 September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved Obama's plan to train and arm the Syrian rebels in their fight against ISIL. In a statement following the House vote, Obama said that the United States would not send military troops to Syria. The Senate gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal the next day. The U.S. did not request permission from the Syrian government, nor did it coordinate its actions with the Syrian government, provide direct notification to the Syrian military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify the Syrian U.N. representative, which the Syrian government confirmed. Before the airstrikes began, the United States also informed Iran, the Assad government's largest regional ally, of their intention to launch airstrikes. It did not share specific timing or targets of strikes with the Iranian government but reportedly assured it that the US would not strike any Syrian government targets. = Contributing countries = * (Operation Okra)  (Operation Impact ¬ß In Syria) ‚Äì Airstrikes ended February 2016 * (Op√©ration Chammal) * (Operation Counter Daesh) * (see Dutch involvement in the Syrian Civil War and Dutch military intervention against ISIL) ‚Äì Began anti-ISIL airstrikes in Syria on 29 January 2016 * (see Jordanian intervention in the Syrian Civil War) * (see Qatari involvement in the Syrian Civil War) * (see Saudi Arabian involvement in the Syrian Civil War) * (see Turkey‚ÄìISIL conflict and Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War) (Operation Shader ¬ß Intervention in Syria) * (Leader) (Operation Inherent Resolve)  Timeline  For a chronological timeline of the intervention, see Timeline of the American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War  Airstrikes on the Khorasan Group  F/A-18 Hornets take off from to strike ISIL targets in Syria One of the groups targeted by U.S. airstrikes was the Khorasan Group, an extremist group of suspected al-Qaeda \\"core\\" members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the U.S. and other Western nations. The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, explosives and munitions production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material. The group is reportedly led by Muhsin al-Fadhli, a leader of al-Qaeda and a close confidant of Osama bin Laden. Intelligence officials expressed concern that the group may include militants who were taught by Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who is known for his sophisticated bomb making techniques that nearly downed two Western airliners. Later statements by government officials indicated that the threat of a plot may have been less severe than initially reported. One official indicated that \\"there did not yet seem to be a concrete plan in the works\\", while another told The Guardian that \\"there was no indication of an imminent domestic threat from the group\\" at the time the United States began bombing. On 6 November, a second round of airstrikes was launched against Khorasan and al-Nusra in northwestern Syria, along with Ahrar ash-Sham at its headquarters in Idlib, whose leadership had been infiltrated by al-Qaeda. On 13 November 2014, the US launched a third set of airstrikes against Khorasan. On 19 November, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Hazm, which struck and destroyed a storage facility associated with the group. On 1 December, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Aleppo. On 24 March 2015, it was revealed that the US airstrikes on Khorasan had killed 17 militants from the group. On 8 July 2015, a US airstrike near the town of Sarmada in Idlib, Syria, killed Muhsin al- Fadhli, the leader of Khorasan.  Ground operations  During the beginning of the coalition interventions, leaders, including U.S. President Obama, said coalition ground forces would not be used in the fight against ISIL either in Iraq or Syria unless they were local coalition forces. While in Iraq thousands of coalition troops from the United States and other nations had been deployed in an advisory capacity, in Syria no ground troops from the coalition intervening in Syria were deployed in the beginning of the intervention. =2015‚Äì16= Syrian Democratic Forces soldiers in Manbij, 2016 In November 2015, the Obama administration began the deployment of U.S. special forces to Syria, on the mission of assisting rebel forces in their fight against ISIL, President Obama then ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Rojava in northern Syria to assist local fighters battling ISIL, authorizing the first open-ended mission by American ground forces into the country. ISIL's deputy leader in Syria, Abu Ali al-Anbari, was killed by JSOC special forces operatives in March 2016, in eastern Syria near the Syrian‚ÄìIraqi border, while he and three other ISIL members were traveling in a vehicle coming from Raqqa. The US Special Forces ordered him to exit the vehicle, intending to arrest him. When he refused and pulled out an assault rifle instead, US forces fired at the vehicle, killing him and the other passengers on board. US commandos also seized electronics and other documents during the operation for intelligence purposes. In March 2016, King Abdullah of Jordan said that British forces had helped in the building up of a mechanized battalion in southern Syria, consisting of tribal fighters to combat the Syrian Army. On 17 March 2016, the day after the declaration of the Federation of Northern Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Syrian Democratic Forces as having \\"proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role.\\" U.S. Army Special Forces in Raqqa, May 2016; one is wearing a Kurdish YPJ patch During the SDF's May 2016 offensive against ISIL in Northern Raqqa, U.S. Special Forces were widely reported and photographed to be present, with some of them wearing badges of the Kurdish YPG and YPJ on their uniforms. On 21 May, Joseph Votel, commanding general of U.S. Central Command, completed a secret hours- long trip to northern Syria to visit several locations where there were U.S. special operations forces and meet with local forces the U.S. was helping train to fight ISIL. The visit came as the first of 250 additional U.S. special operations forces were beginning to arrive in Syria to work with local forces. The commander overseeing the war in Syria, at the end of a long Saturday spent touring SDF bases, said \\"We do, absolutely, have to go with what we've got\\". In September 2016, the U.S. spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF‚ÄìOIR) confirmed that the SDF, including the YPG, is also part of the \\"vetted forces\\" in the train and equip program and would be supplied with weapons. The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, condemned this and claimed that the SDF are \\"endangering our future\\". In October 2016, U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the international coalition against ISIL, said that the SDF would lead the impending assault on Raqqa, ISIL's then-stronghold and capital, and that SDF commanders would plan the operation with advice from American and coalition troops. From November 2016, more than 300 U.S. Special Operations Forces were embedded to train and advise SDF fighters in the Raqqa offensive. =2017‚Äì18= Kurdish troops and U.S. armored vehicle in Al-Hasakah, May 2017 U.S. Army 310th Engineer Company maintaining a Mabey Logistic Support Bridge during the Battle of Raqqa, 29 July 2017 U.S. Marines and Army Special Forces operating in support of the SDF in Syria, October 2018 In March 2017, the Trump administration deployed an additional 400 U.S. Marines to Syria to expand the fight against ISIL in the Raqqa offensive where they could provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces that were preparing an assault on Raqqa to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marked a new escalation in the U.S.'s war in Syria, and put more conventional U.S. troops in the battle that, until then, had primarily used Special Operations units. The 400 Marines were part of the 11th MEU from the Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 4th Marines. They manned an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit provided security; resupplies were handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element. During the Raqqa campaign alone, this small artillery battalion fired over 40,000 shells (including 34,033 155mm), more than were used in the entire 2003 invasion of Iraq and only 20,000 fewer than all those fired by the U.S. military in Operation Desert Storm. In March 2018, SDF press secretary in Deir ez-Zor Mehdi Kobani reportedly told Sputnik Turkiye that U.S. forces were building a \\"large military base\\" in the oil-rich al-Omar region of Deir ez-Zor as new equipment had been reportedly arriving to U.S. bases in Syria. The al- Omar oilfield is the largest oil deposit in Syria, and was captured by the SDF during their campaign against ISIL in October 2017. On 8 April 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump called Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad \\"Animal Assad\\", following suspected chemical attack carried out in the Syrian city of Douma. On 14 April, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom carried out missile strikes against Syria. On 30 May, President Al-Assad responded to the insult, by saying: \\"What you say is what you are.\\" It was reported in June 2018 that the 441st Air Expeditionary Squadron reportedly maintained an unpaved runway in Sarrin, Raqqa Governorate. =2019 drawdown of U.S. ground forces= On 19 December 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he ordered the pullout of all 2,000-2,500 U.S. troops operating in Syria, though no clear timetable was given. A day later, after failing to convince Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria, Jim Mattis announced his resignation as Secretary of Defense. On 3 January 2019, Trump described Syria as \\"sand and death\\" in defense of troop withdrawal. U.S. operations in al-Tanf continued into 2019. On 16 January 2019, a suicide bombing claimed by ISIL in the SDF-controlled town of Manbij killed four U.S. personnel and injured three servicemen, making it the deadliest attack on Coalition forces in the country since the intervention. The ISIL attack drew a second round of criticism of the U.S. president's withdrawal order, with critics linking the attack with an emboldening of ISIL terror and insurgent tactics due to the announcement of a U.S. pullout, despite the group's continued loss of territory in Syria. President Trump offered condolences to the families of the slain American citizens on 17 January while he reaffirmed his policy of withdrawing troops. Trump paid tribute to the fallen Americans during a trip to Dover Air Force Base in the U.S. state of Delaware on 19 January, where their remains were received. On 21 January, an ISIL SVBIED targeted a U.S. convoy accompanied by SDF troops on the Shadadi-Al-Hasakah road in Al-Hasakah province, killing five SDF personnel. Witnesses said the SVBIED rammed into an SDF vehicle by a checkpoint held by Kurdish forces a dozen kilometers outside Shadadi as the U.S. convoy drove past. No Americans were harmed. CNN reported on 24 January that additional U.S. troops were moved to Syria to help provide security for the pullout of equipment and personnel as they are moved out via air and land routes. U.S. Department of Defense officials said the additional security forces would move around Syria to different locations as needed and may move in and out of the country at times. Troop numbers would also fluctuate as American presence gradually declines. Defense officials declined to give specifics on numbers, locations, or timetables, citing security concerns. Local sources reported to Anadolu Agency on 28 January that around 600 U.S. troops had allegedly entered eastern Syria from western Iraq to help with the withdrawal process, arriving at discreet bases in Harab Isk and Sarrin villages set to be used as main evacuation centers during the withdrawal. The news agency added that the American- controlled airfields in Rmeilan and Tell Beydar would be used to airlift heavy weapons and equipment from the country; the Coalition itself did not confirm these reports. By the end of January 2019, according to two U.S. officials, more than 10 percent of American equipment and supplies had been removed from Syria, with 3,000 additional personnel brought into the country to facilitate the draw-down of forces. By 9 February, hundreds of U.S. airstrikes and ground support for the SDF continued as the Kurdish-led force began its final assault on the last ISIL holdouts trapped in a small cluster of hamlets in eastern Syria (including Al-Baghuz Fawqani and southern Al-Marashidah) no larger than a few square miles. U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, believed the SDF would be able to defeat the remaining diehard ISIL fighters ‚Äúin days‚Äù, bringing an end to ISIL's claim of a territorial caliphate. On 18 February, Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Mazlum Kobane expressed hopes the U.S. would halt its total pullout. Kobane said there were discussions about perhaps French and British troops supporting them, but demanded 1,000-1,500 U.S. troops stay in Syria to provide \\"air cover, air support and a force on the ground\\" to help the SDF in its ongoing fight against ISIL. CENTCOM commander Gen. Joseph Votel reiterated the U.S. withdrawal was continuing. With the general withdrawal continuing, the White House announced late on 21 February that 200 residual U.S. troops would remain in Syria as a \\"peacekeeping force\\". The peacekeeping deployment would be indefinite. The next day it was revealed the actual number was 400 troops, not 200, as half would be based in Rojava and half at al-Tanf. Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a \\"safe zone\\" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence. The U.S. is not seeking a United Nations mandate for the deployment and currently does not envision asking NATO to sponsor the mission, an administration official said, adding that the troops would not technically be \\"peacekeepers,\\" a term that carries restricted rules of engagement. On 7 March, Gen. Joseph Votel confirmed that U.S. forces were in no rush to pullout by a specific date, instead saying the completion of the withdrawal was conditional on ISIL no longer posing a security threat to U.S. forces and their allies. By late March, the U.S. continued to stretch the timetable for the pullout. On 29 March, U.S. officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the U.S. more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself. In early May, video emerged online of U.S. forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. The video was posted on Facebook by the pro-SDF \\"Deir Ezzor Media Center\\". Withdrawal from north Syria Following the collapse of the August‚ÄìOctober 2019 Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement and subsequent Turkish offensive, U.S. ground forces began deliberately withdrawing from many of their bases, outposts, and camps in north Syria around 6 October, including Manbij and the Lafarge cement factory, upon \\"precipitous\\" orders from the Donald Trump administration. Senior U.S. military officials said that troops abandoned bases as far south as Tabqah and Raqqa and consolidated all personnel and essential equipment near Koban√Æ to await airlifts and convoys out of the country throughout coming weeks. A U.S. official said the ~1,000 U.S. troops being withdrawn will mostly reposition in western Iraq but also possibly Kuwait and Jordan. From Iraq, U.S. forces could conduct cross-border operations against ISIL in Syria, as they had done so in the past. U.S. soldiers remove equipment and prepare to retrograde from their base at the Lafarge cement factory in north Syria, 15 October 2019 During the withdrawal, which was described in news media as a \\"scramble\\", reports emerged showing that U.S. and SDF troops had hastily stripped their camps and bases of sensitive materials but left fortifications in place, many of which became immediately occupied by Syrian government and Russian forces as they quickly moved into the region as part of a protection deal, established on 13 October, between the Assad government and Rojava. Video emerged online of Russian forces reportedly at an abandoned U.S. outpost near Manbij. On 16 October, two Operation Inherent Resolve F-15 jets bombed their section of the Lafarge cement factory base, located between Koban√Æ and Ayn Issa, \\"to destroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility‚Äôs military usefulness\\" as Turkish- backed militias advanced towards the area. \\"The location had been the headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,\\" Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Myles Caggins III said, adding that \\"No U.S. forces or equipment were ever in jeopardy and remain within separate, secure facilities.\\" SDF personnel burned their part of the base before departing. On the same day, President Trump commented on the developments by describing the Kurds as \\"no angels\\", and about Syria, he said: \\"Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand there that they can play with\\". On 18 October, after a \\"ceasefire\\" between Turkish and Kurdish forces was declared a day prior, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated that the withdrawal was continuing and that the U.S. would continue to communicate with both Turkey and the SDF. A senior defense official stated that U.S. aircraft would continue to conduct intelligence missions over northeast Syria to monitor the situation there. In late October, Esper said the U.S. forces leaving Syria would head into western Iraq. But after Iraqi leaders said those troops can't stay there, Esper said they will be deployed in Iraq only temporarily before returning to the U.S. According to The New York Times, citing U.S. Defense Department officials, by 30 October at least half of the original ~1,000 U.S. troops in Syria had withdrawn and was expected to be reduced to roughly 250 personnel, largely concentrated in the Deir ez-Zor region. On 31 October, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called President Trump as the \\"best American president\\", because he is the most transparent foe, due to his audacity to take the Syrian oil. On 3 November 2019 U.S. and coalition forces departed their strategic military base near the town of Sarrin. U.S. forces removed all their equipment and were seen leaving the base in a convoy of tens of trucks. The base was one of the largest U.S. bases in Syria, a logistics hub that assisted in the anti-ISIL intervention. On 10 November, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated that at least 500-600 U.S. troops would remain in Syria and will not exceed 1,000 personnel. It was not clear if that estimate included the ~200 troops at al-Tanf. By mid-November, Russian and Syrian government forces had quickly filled the power vacuum left behind by the U.S. in much of northern Syria. The U.S. had withdrawn from its logistics base in Koban√Æ by 14 November, with Russia announcing it would set up a new helicopter base in Qamishli the same day. On 17 November, Russia's state-owned Zvezda channel aired footage of armed Russian sappers and Military Police seizing control of the Koban√Æ airbase days prior, with choppers landing on the U.S.-made airstrip there and the Russian flag seen hoisted over the fortification, of which had been stripped of essentials by coalition personnel, only leaving behind toiletries, sleeping facilities, some exercise equipment, and other small items. While Syrian government troops gradually re- established its presence in the region, Russia and Turkey continued to occupy and conduct patrols throughout north east Syria as well, in accordance with the Sochi Agreement. By 4 December, the U.S. had completed its military pullback from northeastern Syria and had consolidated its troop presence in the country to a \\"relatively static\\" 600 personnel, according to Mark Esper. The withdrawal from north Syria was partially carried out by the U.S. Army 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command's Syria Logistics Cell (SLC), a key component of the Army's 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, and Combined Joint Task Force- Operation Inherent Resolve. The former Deputy Defense Secretary for the Middle East Mick Mulroy told Foreign Policy in an interview that the United States should‚Äôve done absolutely everything they could to support the SDF and their continuation of our common goal in fighting ISIS and that the Department of Defense was totally opposed to the Turkish invasion. He said specifically, \\"my concern now is that our partners have to believe that we are in it thick and thin. It‚Äôs not good to have it as a transactional relationship, like a business deal that ends just based on the advantage of one partner at that particular time. That‚Äôs not how to most effectively be a partner in these common fights. It will set a difficult stage for future partnerships.\\" =Eastern Syria redeployment= A U.S. military convoy passes through Qamishli on 26 October 2019, amid the return of U.S. forces to oil fields in northeast Syria By 20 October 2019, after backlash from the U.S. Congress, the Trump administration had conducted a partial reversal of its 6 October order to pullout 1,000 troops from Syria, instead confirming a newly dedicated mission to guard oil and gas fields and infrastructure in SDF-controlled eastern Syria from ISIL insurgent attacks. While U.S. forces continued to reduce its presence in northern Syria by the hundreds to avoid Syrian-SDF and Turkish fighting, the U.S. simultaneously shifted more resources south and east into the oil-rich Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed on 25 October that the U.S. will \\"maintain a reduced presence in Syria and deny ISIS access to oil revenue\\" and, in support of the mission, mechanized and armored units would be deployed to eastern Syria to reinforce the U.S.'s presence there. Throughout late October-early November 2019, this contingent was reinforced with hundreds of new infantry troops joined by mechanized infantry Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs) in Bradley IFVs and‚Äîaccording to unnamed sources‚Äîpotentially tanks, redeployed from Iraq and Kuwait, which was estimated to raise the number of U.S. troops in eastern Syria to around 500 at the time. When coupled with the U.S. garrison at al- Tanf, the contingency force's numbers rise to a flexible 800-900 personnel. M2A2 Bradley IFVs of the 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment (attached to 218th MEB), accompany a U.S. patrol in eastern Syria, 13 November 2019 On 30 October, 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, a U.S. combined arms battalion equipped with M2A2 Bradley IFVs deployed to the Deir ez-Zor region with Bradleys to help guard SDF-U.S. controlled oil and gas fields. The battalion is part of the U.S. Army National Guard's 30th ABCT which had begun arriving in Kuwait the week prior to relieve the regular Army 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division in support of Operation Spartan Shield, the U.S.'s theater-level contingency force for the Middle East. By 31 October, U.S. forces in M-ATV convoys were seen conducting dedicated patrols of oil and gas-related facilities throughout Syria's al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor Governorates, usually accompanied by SDF personnel. The U.S.'s deployment of heavy armored vehicles to Syria for the first time in the intervention‚Äîas opposed to the lighter armored RG-33s, M-ATVs, Strykers, Armored Ground Mobility Systems, and NSTVs (Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles) U.S. special operations units and regular ground forces have used prior‚Äîintroduced additional firepower and force protection capabilities for ground forces. Nevertheless the Bradley IFVs were pulled out of Syria after less than two months of deployment due to unspecified reasons. On 3 November, OIR officials confirmed that multiple artillery rounds landed about one kilometer from a road with a U.S. convoy; OIR, without offering additional details, stated no personnel were injured and the patrol was not hit. The Russian Defense Ministry were the first to report the incident, adding that the incident was near Tell Tamer and that it was elements of Turkish-backed rebels that fired the artillery. On 4 November, Rudaw briefly interviewed a U.S. special operations soldier during a patrol at an oilfield near Rmelan, who stated that U.S. forces are \\"working with the SDF and they're letting us know the situation up here as they see it.\\" According to North Press Agency, the U.S. patrol had begun in Rmelan and spanned the towns of al-Jawadiyah, al- Malikiyah, and Ain-Diwar. On 15 December, a large U.S. logistical convoy en route to Deir ez-Zor was reportedly seen crossing Semalka into al-Hasakah province from Iraq. By mid-January 2020, tensions between Russian and U.S. forces in northeast Syria had reportedly grown as U.S. troops had increasingly began blocking Russian convoys from accessing certain major roads between towns. Both Russia and the U.S. operate military outposts throughout the region as a part of their respective missions. On July 23, 2020, Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue of the 82nd Airborne Division commanding general confirmed that a U.S. paratrooper who died in Syria after suffering fatal injuries in a car crash was in fact on \\"combat deployment.\\" The paratrooper, Sgt. Bryan ‚ÄúCooper‚Äù Mount of St. George, Utah, was also on his \\"second\\" combat deployment as well. On July 27, 2020, the Congressional Research Service issued a report, in which they outlined the American strategy in Syria which would aim to achieve: (1) the enduring defeat of the Islamic State; (2) a political settlement to the Syrian civil war; and (3) the withdrawal of Iranian- commanded forces. On July 30, 2020, the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria signed an agreement with an American oil company, Delta Crescent Energy LLC, to develop oil fields in the region. The Syrian authorities condemned the agreement, and mentioned that: \\"This agreement is null and void and has no legal basis.\\" Seizing oil without local government permission would be a war crime of pillage. On August 17, 2020, U.S. forces killed at least one Syrian soldier and wounded two others, after a fire exchange near a checkpoint in the village of Tal Dahab, near Qamishli, northeastern Syria. On August 25, 2020, a Russian military vehicle rammed a US armored car near Al-Malikiyah, northeastern Syria, in which four US soldiers had suffered mild concussion. Russian defense ministry, Sergey Shoygu, said that \\"the US armed forces soldiers tried to block the Russian patrol\\"; meanwhile, a US defense official said that Russian forces went to a \\"security zone\\" that they should not enter. On September 19, 2020, the US military deployed additional troops, equipment and armoured vehicles in north-eastern region of Syria, after tensions with Russia escalated in the region. According to officials, the moves were meant ‚Äúto help ensure the safety and security of coalition forces.‚Äù Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, mentioned that the United States had deployed Sentinel radars and Bradley vehicles to augment U.S. military in the Eastern Syria Security Area (ESSA).  Turkish involvement  U.S. and Turkish soldiers conduct joint patrols, Manbij outskirts, 1 November 2018 Turkey, a NATO member, has been involved in the Syrian Civil War since the beginning of hostilities. Certain sources have claimed that Turkey has trained and armed the Free Syrian Army and Al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in Syria),, has been involved in certain spillover incidents, been repeatedly accused of collaboration with ISIL, and since 2016, occupied large sections of Syrian territory along the Syria-Turkey border. In October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both Iraq and Syria, including using military force, as well as allowing Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve members to use bases in Turkey. The same month, US Vice President Joe Biden accused Turkey of funding al-Nusra and al Qaeda, after which Turkish President Recep Erdoƒüan demanded an apology, adding that if no apology was made, Biden would become \\"history to me.\\" Biden subsequently apologized. Turkey also holds sovereignty over the Tomb of Suleyman Shah, an exclave which had been located inside Syria, where it maintained a small garrison of 38 Turkish special forces. In February 2015, the Turkish Army launched Operation Shah Euphrates across the border to evacuate its soldiers from the Tomb of Suleyman Shah and relocate the tomb. The Turkish convoy of 572 troops in 39 tanks and 57 armoured vehicles transited through the People's Protection Units-held city of Koban√Æ en route to the tomb. One Turkish soldier was killed in what the government of Turkey described as an accident. Anti- American sentiment in Turkey has increased since the start of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria in January 2018 aimed at ousting the Syrian Democratic Forces from the enclave of Afrin District. A poll conducted in Turkey during the operation revealed that 90% of respondents believed that the United States is \\"behind\\" the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG). After the start of the Turkish invasion, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis stated that \\"Turkey is a NATO ally. It's the only NATO country with an active insurgency inside its borders. And Turkey has legitimate security concerns.\\" Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag urged the United States to end its support for the YPG, saying: \\"Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle.\\" =Northern Syria Buffer Zone= U.S. and Turkish soldiers rendezvous in the Northern Syria Buffer Zone, 4 October 2019. On 15 January 2019, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he agreed with setting up a \\"safe zone\\" in northern Syria, after engaging with U.S. President Donald Trump a few days prior. On 7 August 2019, after months of negotiations, Turkey and the U.S. reached a deal to create a buffer zone in northern Syria along the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Separate from Turkey's own occupation zone in northern Syria, the deal was reached partly to prevent a potential future Turkish ground incursion into Rojava against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. Under the framework of the deal, the U.S. and Turkey conducted joint troop patrols, and Turkish reconnaissance aircraft would be allowed to monitor the zone. Kurdish YPG and YPJ forces along the Turkish border dismantled their border fortifications, withdrew to a \\"security belt\\" alongside regular SDF forces, and removed all heavy weapons from the area. In turn, Turkey was not to conduct airstrikes or establish military observation posts in northern Syria, and was not to \\"occupy\\" the region, as administrative and civil rule was to be relegated to SDF military councils and the Kurdish Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. According to the SDF, the majority of the zone was not to include any cities or towns. The buffer zone agreement was proven to be short-lived and collapsed on 7 October, after U.S. President Donald Trump gave his approval of a Turkish ground offensive into Rojava, and ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria. The agreement was rendered fully obsolete on 9 October, when Turkey launched a ground incursion into Rojava. In response to the offensive, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham warned that he would ‚Äúintroduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria.‚Äù He said he would also ‚Äúcall for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.‚Äù As a response to President Donald Trump withdrawing American troops from the Turkey-Syria border, former Middle East policy chief for the U.S. Department of Defense, Michael \\"Mick\\" Mulroy, stated that the United States ‚Äúshould‚Äôve had long discussions; we should‚Äôve done absolutely everything we could to support [the Syrian Democratic Forces] and their continuation of our common goal in fighting ISIS.‚Äù Mulroy expressed his opposition to both President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision and Turkey‚Äôs aggression by disclosing: ‚ÄúIt was almost universal in the DoD that we were against the Turkish incursion.‚Äù Mulroy had said specifically: ‚ÄúMy concern now is that our partners have to believe that we are in it thick and thin. It‚Äôs not good to have it as a transactional relationship, like a business deal that ends just based on the advantage of one partner at that particular time. That‚Äôs not how to most effectively be a partner in these common fights. It will set a difficult stage for future partnerships.‚Äù  Reports of civilian casualties and war crimes A coalition airstrike on ISIL positions in Koban√Æ. On 29 September 2014, several groups including the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the Aleppo Media Center, and the Local Coordination Committees reported that U.S. strikes hit a grain silo in the ISIL-controlled town of Manbij in northern Syria, killing two civilians. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported ten airstrikes, also targeting various parts of the province of Idlib, killed at least one child and six other civilians. The group said at least 19 civilians had been killed in coalition airstrikes at that time. The Pentagon reported it had no evidence of any civilian casualties from airstrikes targeting militants in Syria. The United States has also acknowledged that its rules to avoid civilian casualties are looser in Syria than those for drone strikes elsewhere. The SOHR and other activist groups reported that seven civilians were killed when an air strike hit a gas distribution facility near the town of al-Khasham is the eastern Deir al-Zor province on 17 October 2014 and three civilians were killed in an air strike on 16 October 2014 in the north east province of al-Hassakah. According to their reports, most of the civilians killed were fuel tanker drivers. According to Reuters, 50 civilians were killed in Syria by US-led airstrikes, from the start of the campaign in late September 2014 to mid- November. On 28 December 2014, a U.S. airstrike in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab killed more than 50 civilians. On 21 May 2015, the United States admitted it \\"probably\\" killed two children in bombings near Harem on 4 and 5 November 2014. These are the first such admissions of the campaign, and followed a military investigation. A similar investigation regarding an event in Syria is underway, and two regarding events in Iraq. Two adult civilians were also minorly injured in the Harem strikes. The deaths and injuries are attributed by the military investigation to unintentional secondary explosions, after the bombers hit their intended targets, linked to the Khorasan. On 19 July 2016 a coalition led airstrike on the ISIL controlled villages of Tokhar and Hoshariyeh reportedly killed at least 56 civilians, including 11 children. On 3 August 2016, dozens of civilians were killed after an airstrike in al-Qa'im, some sources claiming that 30 were killed. Airwars, which \\"maintains an extensive database of all known allegations in which civilians and friendly forces have been reported killed by the Coalition since August 2014\\", reports between 503 and 700 civilians were killed by Coalition airstrikes in Syria as of April 2016. At least 33 people were killed in a U.S.-led coalition airstrike on a school near Raqqa in March 2017 in what is described as war crime. On 16 March 2017, a U.S. airstrike in rebel-held Aleppo killed at least 46 people and wounded more than 100 after warplanes hit a mosque. A destroyed neighborhood in Raqqa in August 2017 According to a report by Amnesty International, the U.S.-led Coalition has provided falsified data to conceal the actual number of civilian deaths resulting from their bombing campaigns and is \\"deeply in denial\\" about civilian casualties in Raqqa. After an investigation by Amnesty International in June 2018, the U.S.-led Coalition confirmed that \\"coalition air strikes killed 70 civilians, mostly women and children ‚Äì including 39 members of a single family.\\" According to Airwars, the strikes of U.S.-led coalition killed as many as 6,000 civilians in Syria and Iraq in 2017. On 2 May 2018, Britain's Ministry of Defense admitted for the first time that a civilian was \\"unintentionally\\" killed in an anti-ISIL drone strike on 26 March 2018. According to the MoD, the civilian was on a motorbike and entered the target area at the last minute. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was \\"deeply regrettable\\". On 25 April 2019 a joint investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars of over 200 strike sites reported that anti-ISIL Coalition bombing during the 2017 Battle of Raqqa had killed 1,600 civilians alone. CJTF-OIR reported the month prior that its 4-year operations over both Iraq and Syria amounted to 1,257 civilian casualties overall. \\"Coalition forces razed Raqqa...Amnesty International and Airwars call upon the Coalition forces to end their denial about the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction caused by their offensive in Raqqa,\\" the investigators said in a joint statement. The Coalition responded that they \\"continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure.\\" By April 2020, Airwars estimated 8,267‚Äì13,168 civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria due to Coalition airstrikes, including 1,755‚Äì2,346 children and 3,609 named victims. The Coalition's own estimate of civilian deaths was 1,377.  Results  F-22 airstrike on 23 September 2014 The U.S.-led air campaign inflicted heavy losses on the Islamic State and, alongside special forces operations, artillery strikes, and material and intelligence support to the SDF, catalyzed the loss of the bulk of ISIL's Syrian territory. According to CJTF-OIR, by May 2016, ISIL had lost 25 percent of the territory it possessed in Syria since the campaign began, mostly due to advances by YPG/SDF forces with heavy Coalition air support. Overall, by the end of 2016 the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria was estimated by the Pentagon to have struck 32,000 targets (including 164 tanks, 400 Humvees, and 2,638 pieces of oil infrastructure) and killed 50,000 militants, with approximately 1/3 of these losses taking place in Syria. By December 2017, the Pentagon increased the estimate to 80,000 ISIL fighters killed by coalition airstrikes between Iraq and Syria. By 23 March 2019, the day of ISIL's territorial collapse in Syria, CJTF-OIR and partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from the Islamic State; as a result, 7.7 million people no longer lived under ISIL's \\"caliphate\\".  Reactions  = Domestic U.S. approval = The intervention was conducted with strong domestic U.S. support; according to Gallup polling in 2014, 61% of Americans supported intervention against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, while 30% were opposed, and 9% undecided. A larger CCGA poll taken in 2016 showed that 72% of Americans supported \\"conducting airstrikes against violent Islamic extremist groups in Syria\\", while 58% also supported \\"sending special operations forces into Syria to fight violent Islamic extremist groups.\\" Additionally, a slim majority (52%) supported \\"enforcing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, including bombing Syrian air defenses.\\" However, only 26% supported \\"sending arms and other supplies to anti-government rebel groups in Syria.\\" A CNN poll conducted between 17‚Äì20 October 2019, showed that 75% of Americans were generally concerned about the situation in Syria, with 43% saying they were \\"very concerned\\". 51% thought the U.S. had a responsibility to remain involved in the Syrian conflict (seven months after ISIL's final Syrian settlement had fallen), while 43% did not. = Syrian reactions = * ‚Äì A week before the first airstrikes, Ali Haidar, the Syrian Minister of National Reconciliation, said that \\"any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria\\". However, despite Haidar's original statement, after the coalition campaign began, the Syrian government struck a more conciliatory tone with Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem suggesting the airstrikes were an indication that Syria and the anti-ISIL coalition were on the same side. Among the general Syrian population, a July 2015 poll by ORB International surveying 1,365 adults in all of Syria's 14 governorates found that 47% supported U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIL while 50% opposed them. Opposition to American airstrikes was strongest in ISIL-held territory, where 92% were opposed; support was strongest in YPG-held territory and government- held territory, where 87% and 55% respectively supported American strikes on ISIL. * Syrian opposition ‚Äì Hadi Bahra, the leader of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces called for airstrikes against ISIL before the intervention began. The coalition is recognized by 20 countries, the European Union, and the Arab league as the legitimate representative of Syria in opposition to the Assad government. Bahra said strikes were needed to weaken ISIL, a faction in the inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War, so that the Free Syrian Army and other moderate opposition forces could oppose Assad more effectively. Despite Bahra's support, many Syrian rebel groups have criticized U.S. airstrikes for targeting only ISIL who are enemies of the Assad government, while not also targeting Assad government forces, the results of which could help government forces gain more ground. Meanwhile, jihadist groups within the opposition have portrayed the coalition as an anti-Sunni stooge of the Syrian regime, while many Sunnis in Syria are angered that only extremist Sunnis are being targeted while mostly Shiite Assad forces are not targeted. Some rebels defected to extremist groups as a result of the U.S. decision to strike jihadist groups other than ISIL, such as the al-Nusra Front. = International reactions = In a Pew poll taken in 2015, a median of 62% of people across the nations polled said they support American military efforts against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, while a median of 24% were opposed. Among those in support were 78% of Lebanese, 77% of Jordanians, 48% of Turks, 53% of Palestinians, and 84% of Israelis, as well as 81% of French, 66% of British, and 62% of Germans.America's Global Image. Pew Research Center. June 2015. * ‚Äì Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister of Australia, praised the intervention, saying that an international effort was needed in order to combat the ISIL threat. Despite Abbott's support for the intervention, the Australian Government said it is not likely to contribute forces to operations in Syria. * ‚Äì Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, said in October 2014 Canada would strike ISIL targets in Syria if the Assad government gave approval. New Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called President Obama almost immediately after coming into office to inform him that Canada will be ceasing air operations in coordination with Americans. Trudeau did not give a time frame. * ‚Äì Lubom√≠r Zaor√°lek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic supported the intervention against the Islamic State and said that it is important to keep supporting the ground forces in the battle against ISIS and the Czech Republic will keep providing military support to the Iraqi army and to the Kurdish Peshmerga. He also noted that air strikes would not defeat Islamic State. The Czech government said that ISIS is enemy not only for safety in the Middle East, but also for security and stability in the Czech Republic and Europe. * ‚Äì The Ecuadorian government opposed the airstrikes in Syria without the consent of the Syrian government. * - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi expressed his government's support for the international campaign against ISIL, and a spokesperson for the Egyptian foreign ministry echoed his statements by reiterating the Egyptian government's willingness to back the war against ISIL. * - German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier questioned whether President Obama's plan was adequate in order to combat ISIL and said Germany had not been asked to participate in airstrikes nor would it participate if asked. * - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani condemned ISIL's actions but also called the airstrikes in Syria \\"illegal\\" because they were conducted without the consent of the Syrian government. Iran's deputy foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian was reported in Iranian media as saying that Iran had warned the United States that Israel would be at risk should the US and its allies seek to topple Syrian president Bashar al-Assad while fighting ISIL in Syria. * - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel fully supported the U.S. government's calls for united action against ISIL. * - A spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Japanese government would continue to closely coordinate with the United States and other countries, along with offering support and cooperation in their strikes against ISIL. * ‚Äì Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, showed understanding for the intervention against ISIL in Syria and said that his government was exploring options to contribute in the fight against ISIL. * ‚Äì Alexander Lukashevich, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, opposed the military intervention \\"without the consent of the legitimate government\\" and said that \\"this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law\\". On 14 October, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov questioned the motives of the intervention, saying \\"Maybe their stated goal is not entirely sincere? Maybe it is regime change?\\" He also questioned the effectiveness of the year long campaign \\"With, as far as I know, 25,000 sorties they [US-led air campaign] could have smashed the entire [country of] Syria into smithereens,\\" continuing to remark that \\"positive results 'on the ground' are not visible\\". He also criticized the continued supply of arms to rebels, saying \\"I want to be honest, we barely have any doubt that at least a considerable part of these weapons will fall into the terrorists' hands.\\" He continued to call for the countries involved to join a coalition made up of Russian, Syrian, Iranian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Hezbollah forces against what Russia claims is solely ISIL and al Qaeda, but the US has asserted is primarily non-jihadist opposition forces. : Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the US air strikes on the Shayrat airbase as \\"an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext.... a serious blow to Russian-US relations, which are already in a poor state\\". : Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the Sharyat attack as \\"an act of aggression under a completely invented pretext\\". He compared events in April 2017 to \\"the situation of 2003, when the USA, the UK and several of their allies invaded Iraq without the UN Security Council's approval - a grave violation of international law - but at that point they at least tried to show some material evidence.\\" * ‚Äì The Davutoglu Government called on the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to approve measures that would grant extensive authority to the President to launch military operations in both Syria and Iraq, including the authority to send troops across the border, although it is unclear whether the Turkish leadership intends to act on that authority. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has urged the establishment of a no-fly zone by coalition forces in northern Syria. * ‚Äì A spokesperson for British Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would not rule out airstrikes in Syria against ISIL. On 26 September 2014 Parliament voted 524 to 43 to approve action inside Iraq. While visiting Iraqi Kurdistan in mid October, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he saw no immediate demand from U.S. and Arab militaries for Britain to extend its airstrikes to Syria. British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said on 21 October that British Reaper drones and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft would be starting intelligence-gathering missions in Syria \\"very shortly.\\" * ‚Äì In November 2019, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. troops to secure the oil fields in eastern Syria, then said any remaining U.S. troops in Syria were there \\"only for the oil\\", and that the U.S. was \\"keeping the oil\\". * ‚Äì Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, welcomed the airstrikes against militants in Syria, but noted that the involved parties \\"must abide by international humanitarian law and take all precautions to avoid and minimize civilian casualties\\". * ‚Äì At the 69th General Assembly of the United Nations, President Nicolas Maduro said \\"It's President Bashar al- Assad and the Syrian government which have stopped the terrorists\\" and continued by saying \\"Instead of bombing and bombing, we must make an alliance for peace\\".

During his career he recorded more than 20 albums and CDs in genres ranging from folk, children's songs, jazz, to classical. He also gave concerts in more than fifty countries, and appeared at the White House and Carnegie Hall. His musical influences included Pete Seeger, clarinetist Tony Scott, and pianist Peter Lang. Crofut also experimented with different performance styles and instrumentations, such as performing classical music on the banjo. Life and career Crofut was born in Cleveland, Ohio, attended the Putney High School and majored in music and literature at Allegheny College, where he took lessons on the French horn. He graduated in 1958 and then was drafted into the U.S. Army, being discharged in 1960.Crofut (1968), p. 64 In the 1960s he toured with singer, guitarist, and long-time friend Stephen Addiss (b. 1935) as part of the U.S. State Department's cultural exchange program; they would later collaborate on several albums. In April 1963 Crofut and Addiss met with President Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara at the White House, where they were awarded a citation for their work in the cultural exchange program.Crofut (1968), p. 254 The pair also met with United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson the same year when they performed at a party Stevenson gave for U.N. delegates.Crofut (1968), p. 173 Addiss and Crofut toured with Stan Getz in 1963.Crofut (1968), p. 176 In the 1970s Crofut performed with baritone Benjamin Luxon and harpsichordist Kenneth Cooper; he also taught a vocal master class during summers at the Tanglewood Music Center, and taught intermittently in the world music program at Wesleyan University in the 1980s. In addition, Crofut made several recordings with Chris Brubeck and classical guitarist Joel Brown. He appeared on the Today show, the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and the NPR show A Prairie Home Companion. He also appeared on the TV series Rainbow Quest with Steve Addiss and Vietnamese songwriter Pham Duy. For a time in the mid 70s he was joined on tour at venues such as Town Hall and Alice Tully Hall and recorded with guitarist Kevin Weyl. He and his second wife Susan established the Simple Gifts for Children Fund in 1998 to benefit children in western Massachusetts. Among the instruments Crofut owned was a harpsichord he built from a kit by Hubbard Harpsichords,Folk and Baroque (1975), Liner notes and a pipe organ he built himself. He also built a banjo from plans and designs by the Merlin Manufacturing Company. His last recording (Dance on a Moonbeam) is a compilation of children's songs with Frederica von Stade, Dawn Upshaw, Chris Brubeck, and the London Symphony Orchestra. The songs are interspersed with passages from Shakespeare read by Meryl Streep. Crofut described the first time he heard Pete Seeger at a concert at Oberlin College in the 1950s: > He spoke for those who could not speak for themselves ... His was the voice > of the underdog, the conscience of youth, the power of conviction. And his > was the voice that made me go out and buy a banjo and a Seeger instruction > record. I practiced eight hours a day and it wasn't long before I was good > enough to accompany songs that lashed out at the things that bothered me. > Naturally these efforts took their toll on my grades. ... Pete was building > a barn then, and in return for my help with the construction he gave me > banjo lessons. Without the Seegers I probably never would have made the > grade as a performer.Crofut (1968), pp. 68-70 Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in his foreword to Crofut's book Troubadour: A Different Battlefield, stated: > Mr. Crofut and his companion, Mr. Addiss, have rightly been called the > \\"troubadours of goodwill.\\" This is the story of African schoolchildren who > came for miles to share a performance with them at the top of a hill in > Kenya; of the playing to a chorus of artillery fire before Vietnamese > villagers; singing to wounded students in Korea; reaching remote villages by > bamboo rafts in northern Thailand; and teaching finger game songs to > children in Nepal ...

The Martian, a 2011 novel by Andy Weir, served as the screenplay adapted by Drew Goddard. The film depicts an astronaut's (Matt Damon) lone struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind, and efforts to rescue him and bring him home to Earth. It also stars Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Pe√±a, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover, and Benedict Wong. Produced through 20th Century Fox, the film is a co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States. Producer Simon Kinberg began developing the film after Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in Budapest, Hungary. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used for exterior filming. The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2015, while the London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX. It received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the 10th-highest-grossing film of 2015. The Martian received praise for its direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability, largely due to Damon's performance. It received several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy, seven nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Goddard, and the 2016 long form Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Damon won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor. Plot In 2035, the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. A severe dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The mission is scrubbed, but as the crew evacuates, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm. The telemetry from his suit's biomonitor is damaged and Watney is wrongly presumed dead. With the MAV on the verge of toppling, the surviving crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the Hermes. Watney awakens after the storm, injured and with a low-oxygen warning. He returns to the crew's surface habitat (\\"Hab\\") and treats his wound. As Watney recovers, he begins a video diary. Lacking communication with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV will be landing away at the Schiaparelli crater. Watney's immediate concern is food; being the mission's botanist, he improvises a garden inside the Hab using Martian soil fertilized with the crew's bio-waste, and manufactures water from leftover rocket fuel. He then plants the crew's unused potatoes. He also begins modifying the rover for the distance trek to the Ares IV landing site. On Earth, NASA satellite planner Mindy Park, reviewing aerial Hab images, notices moved equipment and realizes Watney is alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders publicly releases the news, though the Ares III crew (still en route to Earth) are not told so that they remained focused on their mission. Sanders overrules Hermes flight director Mitch Henderson, who believes the crew should know. Watney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using Pathfinders camera and motor, he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth, first using hand-written signs, and then sending and receiving ASCII in hexadecimal. NASA transmits a software patch to link the rover with Pathfinder and communicate via text. Watney is angry that the Hermes crew is unaware that he is alive. Sanders finally allows Henderson to inform them. Mars mission director, Vincent Kapoor, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris space probe to deliver enough food for Watney to survive until Ares IV's arrival. Meanwhile, the Hab's airlock malfunctions, killing the potato plants and sterilizing the soil. Believing it a low risk, Sanders orders the routine pre-flight safety inspections be bypassed to expedite the probe's launch. The rocket explodes soon after liftoff. Watney now believes his death on Mars is inevitable. The China National Space Administration has been developing a classified booster rocket, the Taiyang Shen. Feeling camaraderie with NASA's scientists, they sought a way to work around official barriers and offer to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney's situation grows riskier as time passes, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: have the Taiyang Shen rendezvous with and resupply the Hermes, which will then use Earth's gravity to \\"slingshot\\" back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the Hermes crew. Henderson surreptitiously sends Purnell's plan to the crew; they unanimously vote to implement it, disabling NASA's remote controls and making the course change. Powerless to stop them, NASA concedes the issue. Watney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned. The MAV needs to be lightened to intercept with Hermes on its new course. Watney removes many components, and replaces the nose cone with canvas. After takeoff, the MAV fails to reach the required speed. Commander Lewis maneuvers the Hermes to decelerate by using the spacecraft's RCS system. She also orders a directional explosive decompression of the internal atmosphere to better align the ship. In a Manned Maneuvering Unit, Lewis is unable to reach Watney when the tether falls short. Watney pierces his pressure suit, using the escaping air to propel himself to Lewis. He and the crew are reunited after Mark's 560 sols alone on Mars. After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V (commanded by Martinez) is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives. Cast Chastain prepared for her role by meeting with astronauts and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. She was inspired by astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson, saying \\"She's very matter of fact, very straightforward. My character is dealing with the guilt of leaving a crew member behind, but she's still responsible for the lives of five other crew mates. I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments.\\" Damon prepared for the role by a different method than Chastain. He explained, \\"For me the rehearsal process was sitting with Ridley and going kind of line-by-line and moment-by-moment through the script and playing out a plan of attack for what we wanted each scene to accomplish.\\" The Media Action Network for Asian-Americans (MANAA) criticized the casting of white actor Mackenzie Davis as Mindy Park who it said was described by author Andy Weir as Korean-American. The group also criticized the casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, who the MANAA said Weir described as an Asian Indian character. In the novel, the character's name was Venkat Kapoor, and he identifies religiously as a Hindu (a Baptist and a Hindu in the film). The group called the casting whitewashing and said that Asian actors, being under-represented in Hollywood, were deprived of acting opportunities. Weir said in October 2015 he perceived Mindy Park as Korean but said he did not explicitly write her as Korean. He also dismissed criticism of Ejiofor's casting as Kapoor, \\"[Kapoor]'s an American. Americans come from lots of different sources. You can be Venkat Kapoor and black.\\" In the original novel, Weir intentionally avoided including the physical descriptions of his characters. Naomi Scott was cast as Ryoko, a member of the JPL team. She filmed her scenes but they were removed from the final cut. Clip from Production Director Ridley Scott =Development= The Martian was directed by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film. The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay, and the opportunity to work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved. Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed, telling Creative Screenwriting, \\"When it's Scott, collaboration is easy because I just revere him. Every day I would just look around and think, 'Is that really Ridley Scott sitting there at the table? This is exciting! =Filming= Wadi Rum in Jordan was used for external scenes on Mars in filming The Martian. Korda Studios west of Budapest, Hungary, in the wine-making village of Etyek was chosen for filming interior scenes of The Martian. It was favored for having one of the largest sound stages in the world. Filming began in Hungary on November 24, 2014. Around 20 sets were constructed for the film, which was filmed with 3D cameras. Actual potatoes were grown in a sound stage next to the one used for filming. They were planted at different times so that different stages of growth could be shown in film scenes. A team of six people built 15 suits for the film. External scenes, some with Matt Damon, were filmed in Wadi Rum, a UNESCO world heritage site located in Jordan, over eight days in March 2015. Wadi Rum had been used as a location for other films set on Mars, including Mission to Mars (2000), Red Planet (2000) and The Last Days on Mars (2013). Total filming time for the film lasted approximately 70 days. A special Mars rover model was built for the filming; the movie cast and team presented the rover model to Jordan in return for the hospitality they had received. The rover is now exhibited in Jordan's Royal Automobile Museum. Weir avoided writing Watney as lonely and depressed in his novel. While Watney's humor is preserved in the film, Scott also depicted the character's isolation in the vast, dusty Martian landscape. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"The scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity, which is magnificently represented by exteriors shot in the vicinity of Wadi Rum in Jordan.\\" Damon said he and Scott were inspired by the documentary film Touching the Void (2003), which featured trapped mountain climbers. Scott also expected to film Watney as a Robinson Crusoe, a character in full isolation, but learned to film Watney differently since the character would be self-monitoring his behavior under the watch of various mission cameras. According to Scott, the first cut of the movie was 2 hours and 45 minutes long. An extended cut of the movie was released on home video. =NASA involvement= Damon while making hand prints in concrete at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is accompanied by Jim Erickson (left) and Andrew J. Feustel (right). When the novel was first published, NASA invited Weir to tour the Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began preparing the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over a period of a month, NASA answered hundreds of questions‚Äîon a weekly basis‚Äîon everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential \\"habs\\"‚Äîthe residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designer created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as \\"the space agency that we all dream of\\" and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as \\"a run down college campus\\". Newsweek said NASA collaborated more with The Martian than most other films: \\"Staff from many NASA departments consulted on the film, from script development through principal photography, and are now helping with marketing timed to the theatrical release.\\" As part of the collaboration, the production's NASA liaison included the front page of the script for the film in the payload of the spacecraft Orion during its Exploration Flight Test 1 on December 5, 2014. The Los Angeles Times said NASA and the wider scientific community anticipated the film as a way to publicize a human mission to Mars. The New York Times reports that the film \\"serves as a nice plug for NASA, which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website. (On Monday [September 28, 2015], scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, timing that suggests NASA certainly has the whole cross-promotion thing down.)\\" Jim Erickson, NASA project manager, said the film would show moviegoers \\"the risks and rewards\\" of humans traveling to Mars. In October 2015, NASA presented a new web tool to follow Watney's trek across Mars and details of NASA's next steps, as well as a health hazards report for a real-world human journey to Mars. In 2016, then sitting U.S. President Barack Obama who made the annual NASA budget requests to Congress, named The Martian as among the best science fiction films he had ever seen. Music Harry Gregson-Williams composed the score for The Martian. It is the fourth collaboration between Gregson-Williams and Scott. Gregson-Williams previously worked on music for Scott's films Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Prometheus (2012) and Exodus: Gods and Kings, composing the main film score for the first and last films, and doing additional music for the other two. A running gag in the film is commander Melissa Lewis's love for 1970s songs (especially of the disco genre, which apparently Watney hates), the only music available to Watney on Mars which often appears as diegetic music. The soundtrack includes: * \\"Turn the Beat Around\\" by Vicki Sue Robinson * \\"Hot Stuff\\" by Donna Summer * \\"Rock the Boat\\" by The Hues Corporation * \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" by Thelma Houston * \\"Starman\\" by David Bowie * \\"Waterloo\\" by ABBA * \\"Love Train\\" by The O'Jays * \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor (closing credits) The exit music, which includes \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" and \\"I Will Survive,\\" is a commentary on Watney's situation on Mars. Marketing 20th Century Fox launched a viral marketing campaign for The Martian. On June 7, 2015, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino shared an in-universe video diary depicting Damon's character and the other crew members. Ars Technica compared the video diary to similar viral videos marketed for Scott's 2012 film Prometheus in having a similar \\"style of slickly produced fictional promotional material\\". The studio then released an official trailer on June 8. Forbes said, \\"20th Century Fox has cut together a pretty perfect trailer in that it absolutely makes the sale. It establishes the stakes, offers a sympathetic lead character, shows off an all-star cast, tosses out a potential catchphrase, and ends on a grimly humorous tagline.\\" In response to the trailer, Jimmy Kimmel, host of the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, released a spoof trailer, The Mastronaut: Emission to Mars, that edited the original to parody the film. As a part of promotional cooperation from NASA, the space agency screened The Martian at the International Space Station on September 19, 2015. At the start of August, Fox released another video, depicting interviews with each of the main crew members. Mid-month, the studio released another film trailer, and NASA hosted a \\"Martian Day\\" at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to both promote The Martian and highlight the space program's ongoing efforts to carry out a human mission to Mars. At the end of August, Fox released another video, presenting it as a special episode of the TV series StarTalk in which astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses the hazards of traveling to Mars. In September, Scott's RSA Films released a teaser for The Martian that depicted Damon wearing Under Armour sports clothing and being active in his off-world tasks. The teaser originated from a collaboration between RSA Films and the marketing shop 3AM (under theatrical advertising agency Wild Card), initiated in 2014, to produce advertising content for The Martian. RSA contacted the advertising agency Droga5, under whom Under Armour is a client. Droga5 ultimately collaborated with WME and 3AM to produce the teaser. Forbess Peter Himler said American astronauts had traditionally been used by public relations to promote commercial products, starting with the drink Tang. Himler said it \\"came as no surprise\\" that NASA astronauts in the International Space Station were reported by The Guardian and CBS News as having read Weir's novel and hoping to see the film on board the ISS. NASA participated in the marketing of the film despite its lack of involvement with previous films. Though it turned down a request for Interstellar to be screened on the ISS, The Martian was screened on board 402 km (250 miles) above the Earth's surface on September 19, 2015, and also at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral on October 1, 2015. In November 2015, 20th Century Fox announced The Martian VR Experience, a \\"virtual reality adventure\\" where viewers play as Mark Watney and reenact scenes from the film. The project was executive produced by Scott alongside Joel Newton and directed by Robert Stromberg. It was released for HTC Vive and PlayStation VR on November 15, 2016, and is also available for the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. The project won 2 major awards; a Silver Lion at the Cannes Film Festival and an AICP Award. Release Damon and his wife Luciana Boz√°n Barroso at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The Martian premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2015. The film screened in a sneak preview at the New York Film Festival on September 27, 2015. It also screened at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, on September 29, 2015. The film was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema in North America. =Box office forecast= Two months before The Martians release, BoxOffice forecast that the film would gross on its opening weekend in the United States and ultimately in its theatrical run. The magazine said positive factors for its performance included the continued sales of Weir's novel, Scott's success with past science fiction films, and the positive reception of prior space- based films Gravity (2013) and Interstellar (2014). The magazine said negative factors included Damon not being a consistent draw at the box office, Gravity and Interstellar setting high expectations, and Scott's \\"stumble\\" with his previous film Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014). A week before the film's release, pre-release trackings in North America (United States and Canada) showed that the film was on pace to earn between $40‚Äì50 million at its opening weekend from 3,826 theaters. In comparison to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, which had the benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, The Martian was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The Martian played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The Martian did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity. =Theatrical run= The Martian was a financial success. It grossed $228.4 million in the United States & Canada and $401.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $630.2 million against a budget of $108 million. Worldwide, it was the highest-grossing Fox film of 2015 and the tenth-highest-grossing film of that year overall. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $150.32 million while The Hollywood Reporter reported around $80‚Äì100 million profits for the film. The film was released in theaters in 2D and 3D. In the United Kingdom, it was released on September 30, 2015, a Wednesday, and in the United States on the following Friday, October 2, 2015. It was also released in 49 markets including Mexico, Hong Kong, India and Taiwan from the weekend October 2‚Äì4, 2015 and expanded to Germany, Russia, and South Korea the following weekend. It opened in Spain on October 16, then France on October 21. China opened on November 25 and Japan bowed in the first quarter of 2016 on February 5. Various sites estimated the film to gross between $45 and $50 million over its opening weekend in the United States. In North America, it opened on Friday, October 2, 2015, and earned $18.06 million on its opening day of which $2 million came from premium large formats from 3,831 theaters. The film's Friday gross included $2.5 million from late-night Thursday screenings that took place in 2,800 theaters. During its opening weekend, it earned $54.3 million from 3,831 theaters ranking first at the box office which is the second biggest October opening, behind Gravity ($55.7 million) and the second biggest for Scott, behind Hannibal ($58 million) and Damon, behind The Bourne Ultimatum ($69.2 million). The film made $6 million at 375 premium large format screens. 3D accounted for 45% of the ticket sales while RealD 3D accounted for 42% or $23 million of that sales which is one of highest for the 3D company in 2015. The film fell short of breaking Gravitys record which might have been hurt by Hurricane Joaquin, the NFL season and the last day of the Major League Baseball regular season. In its second weekend of release, it dropped gradually by 31.9% and earned $37 million from 3,854 theaters (+23 theaters) maintaining the top position. The Martians demographics in its sophomore weekend remained in sync with its opening frame drawing 52% males and 72% over 25. It topped the box office for two consecutive weekends before being dethroned by Goosebumps in its third weekend after a close race between the two ($23.6 million for Goosebumps and $21.3 million for The Martian). It returned to the top of the box office for the third time in its fourth weekend, and went on the top the box office for four non-consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Spectre in its fifth weekend. On November 5, the film surpassed Gladiator ($187.7 million) to become Scott's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office. Internationally, The Martian was released in a total of 81 countries. Outside North America, it opened on the same weekend in 54 markets and grossed $44.6 million from 9,299 screens topping the international box office as well as opening at No. 1 in over 15 markets. The following weekend, it added 23 more markets and grossed an estimated $57.5 million from 77 markets from 12,859 screens. Its opening weekends in South Korea ($12.5 million), the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($10.2 million), Russia and the CIS ($7.4 million), France ($6.9 million), Australia ($4.5 million) and Germany ($4.3 million; behind Inside Out) represented its largest takings. In terms of total earnings, the United Kingdom ($35.3 million), South Korea ($33.6 million), Australia ($16.57 million) and Germany ($16 million) are the top markets. In South Korea, it became Fox's third-highest-grossing film ever behind Avatar (2009) and Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015). It topped the box office outside of North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Ant-Man in its third weekend but returned to the top in its fourth weekend. In its fifth weekend, it was surpassed by Spectre thereby topping the international box office for three weekends in total. The Martian opened in China on Wednesday, November 25 and earned $50 million in its five-day opening weekend from 4,848 screens of which $6.6 million came from 249 IMAX theaters. In its second weekend, it fell by 60% to $13.7 million, while in total, it grossed $95 million there. It opened in Japan on February 5, 2016 under the name Odyssey, where it earned $5.2 million from 8,333 screens in its three-day opening weekend, debuting at No. 1 at the box office and helped the film push past the $600 million mark. Its Saturday and Sunday take was $4.25 million. It dropped just 19% in its second after adding $3.4 million. It has topped the box office there for four consecutive weekends and as of February 28 has grossed a total of $23.2 million. For its United States release, the film was originally scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's fall season (September‚ÄìNovember). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology was being used in more immersive storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples. =Home media= The Martian was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 12, 2016. It was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 14, 2016. An extended cut of the film adding an additional twenty minutes was released on June 7, 2016. Reception =Critical response= As of October 2020, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film had a 91% approval rating based on 374 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The website's critics consensus read, \\"Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny, The Martian offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott.\\" As of October 2020, Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars and a 66% \\"definite recommend\\". Audience demographics were 54% men and a total 59% over 35. The Martian received praise for its direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability, largely due to Damon's performance. Variety reported, \\"Critics are calling the film a funny, thrilling ride, and a return to form for [Ridley] Scott after The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings fell flat.\\" According to aerospace engineer Dr. Robert Zubrin, commenting in The Guardian: Writing for the New York Post, Lou Lumenick considered the film to be Scott's and Damon's best and thought that it is a \\"straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar\\". Manohla Dargis, of The New York Times, stated that the film \\"involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he's physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free\\", from a film director, whose \\"great, persistent theme is what it means to be human\\". Negative reviews focused on the lack of character depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, \\"It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It hardly seems interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey.\\" In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors \\"are treated as accessories\\", and that the director is \\"workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian‚Äîthat's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?\\" In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: \\"Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott's two masterpieces ‚Äì Alien and Blade Runner ‚Äì it's not even on the same continent.\\" The Martian was listed on nearly two dozen critics' top ten lists for 2015. =Accolades= The film was included in many critics' Top Ten Films of 2015 lists. The film received various industry awards and nominations including 26 Best Picture, 20 Best Director (for Scott), and 19 Best Actor (for Damon) nominations at different organizations and associations. The American Film Institute selected The Martian as one of the Top Ten Films of the year. The film garnered two Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy and Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Damon. Scott was also nominated for Best Director. It received nine nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Visual Effects. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The Martian was named Film of the Year by National Board of Review also winning Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Ranked at position eight, it won the Top Ten Films of the year award at African-American Film Critics Association. It received eight nominations from Satellite Awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture, Best Screenplay ‚Äì Adapted, and Best Visual Effects. The Martian was named one of the best films of 2015 by over 50 critics and publications and was ranked seventh on Rotten Tomatoes and thirteenth on Metacritic's best scored film of 2015. Solanum watneyi, a species of bush tomato from Australia, has been named after the character of Mark Watney, to honor the fictional heroic botanist portrayal. It is a member of the same genus as the potato, Solanum. Scientific accuracy James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, worked as an adviser for the film. When Weir wrote the novel The Martian, he strove to present the science correctly and used reader feedback to get it right. When Scott began directing the film, he also sought to make it realistic and received help from James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Green put together teams to answer scientific questions that Scott asked. Green said, \\"The Martian is reasonably realistic\\", though he said the film's hazardous dust storm, despite reaching speeds of would in reality have weak force. Green also found the NASA buildings in the film to be more stylish than the functional ones NASA actually uses. Film critics picked up the point that the Martian winds could amount to \\"barely a light breeze\\" in their reviews, and screenwriter Goddard agreed the winds had to be considerably exaggerated in order to set up the situation that sets the story in motion. The process used by the character Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover. The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat. When his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer. \\"We could probably grow something on Mars\\", said Michael Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History. However Martian soil has since been found to be toxic to both plant and animal life, although it is believed that microbial organisms have the potential to live on Mars. In one scene, the glass face shield on Watney's helmet cracks; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level, he quickly patches the helmet with duct tape and avoids suffocation. According to Shara, \\"As long as the pressure on the inside is around 30%, you could hold it together before your eyes blow out or you had an embolism.\\" While Martian gravity is less than 40% of Earth's, director Scott chose not to depict the gravitational difference, finding the effort less worthwhile to put on screen than zero gravity. Scott said the heavy spacesuits would weigh the main character enough to make up for not showing the partial gravity. The climate of Mars is also cold enough that it would make Watney's initial plan to disable the rover's heater immediately impractical. The average temperature is ; it is cold enough on Mars for carbon dioxide snow to fall at the poles in winter. The plot key to the eventual rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice that has been used on a number of robotic planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would have been one of the first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered. Ed Finn, director of the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University, said, \\"What this story does really well is imagine a near-future scenario that doesn't push too far of where we are today technically.\\" British physicist Brian Cox said, \\"The Martian is the best advert for a career in engineering I've ever seen.\\" See also * Astrobotany * List of films set on Mars ** Robinson Crusoe on Mars ** Stranded * Martian * Oxia Palus quadrangle * Robinsonade * Survival film Notes References External links  * The Martian ‚Äì Mark Watney's trek across Mars at NASA * The Martian ‚Äì Nine real NASA technologies at NASA * The Martian at Museum of the Moving Image Category:2015 films Category:2015 3D films Category:2015 science fiction action films Category:2010s science fiction adventure films Category:2010s science fiction drama films Category:2010s survival films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American 3D films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American science fiction adventure films Category:American science fiction drama films Category:American space adventure films Category:American survival films Category:British films Category:British 3D films Category:British science fiction action films Category:British science fiction adventure films Category:British science fiction drama films Category:British space adventure films Category:British survival films Category:English- language films Category:IMAX films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films about space hazards Category:Films about NASA Category:Films about solitude Category:Films directed by Ridley Scott Category:Films produced by Simon Kinberg Category:Films with screenplays by Drew Goddard Category:Films scored by Harry Gregson-Williams Category:Films set in the future Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films shot in Jordan Category:Films set in deserts Category:Films set in Beijing Category:Films set in Houston Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Pasadena, California Category:Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners Category:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form winning works Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe winning performance Category:Hard science fiction Category:Mars in film Category:Scott Free Productions films Category:TSG Entertainment films Category:2015 drama films ","title":"The Martian (film)"},{"id":"43683278","text":"Phander Lake is situated in the Phander Village, in Koh-i-Ghizer, Ghizer District, the westernmost part of the Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan region and northernmost territory of Pakistan.

He is the former President and CEO of EllisDon Corporation and is widely recognized for co-founding the construction giant and the landmark projects it was responsible for completing. EllisDon now has over 2500 employees, bringing in over $3.5 billion in revenues annually. Don was driven in all facets of his life and was relentless and honest in everything that he did. His determination and motivation extended well beyond his business, but to positively impacting the lives of others as well.  Early life  Donald \\"Bus\\" Smith was born on March 23, 1924 in Provost, Alberta, to Donald Bennett Smith and Florence Marie Smith. Don had an older brother, David Ellis Smith, and a younger sister, Muriel. In 1929, when the stock market crashed, Donald Bennett Smith, a bank manager, lost everything. In 1930, during the Great Depression, when Don was six years old, his father suddenly died leaving Florence and the children with nothing at all. With no prospects in Provost and no way of supporting her family, Florence and her children were forced to move to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Upon moving to North Toronto, Florence found a home and a job as a Sales Clerk at Eaton's department store. Soon after, Smith's cousin George Ellis moved in with the family when his own father died. With his mother always working and no father, Smith decided he needed to start making his own way. At the age of 10, Don was given a toy movie projector from his mother. He proved himself a natural entrepreneur when he began using it to host Charlie Chaplin movie screenings in his basement for the neighbourhood kids, charging five-cents a head per showing. Don later became a paper boy for the Toronto Star with his own route where he was successful. A combination of the Toronto Star paper route and other part-time jobs taught Smith the value of hard work. As a young adult, Smith aspired to be an aeronautical engineer and so he enrolled into the Engineering program at the University of Toronto Due to a condition from birth, Don suffered from a tremor in his hands which caused him to have bad writing. Don's professors returned ungraded tests because they couldn't read his writing and as a result, he was forced to drop out of school after his first year of university. Shortly after, he joined Foundation Company, one of the biggest construction firms in Canada at the time where he was made Superintendent by the age of 25. In January, 1949, Don married his wife, Elizabeth Joan McDonald. The newlywed couple moved to London, Ontario where they had their first child, Catherine, the same year in November. Catherine was their first of seven children followed by Robert, Lynne, Geoff, Michael, Donald, and David. Joan was a University of Toronto graduate with a degree in Philosophy. She began her career with charitable service and eventually moved on to municipal and provincial politics.  Career  At age 27, Don quit his job at Foundation Company in pursuit of his own company. On April Fools' Day, 1951, Don and his brother David launched EllisDon. The name of the company combined Don's first name and David's middle name, Ellis. Their first project was a small home renovation job which was funded by their mother who was also their bookkeeper. On the first day of business EllisDon also received a contract for a small three-room schoolhouse, Northdale Public School in London, Ontario. Shortly after its inception, David left EllisDon and relocated to Calgary, Ontario. From the beginning, Don built EllisDon into an industry leader with rapid growth. It began with schools and universities and eventually moved into other sectors like healthcare and office buildings, among other projects. Between 1956 and 1968, EllisDon made critical business investments, which included computerizing its accounting and cost control systems, and operating a purchased tower crane ‚Äì the first construction company in Canada to do both. In 1971, EllisDon cemented safety as a top priority by becoming one of the first construction companies to launch a Corporate Safety Strategy to improve overall job site safety. Between 1974 and 1976, EllisDon focused on expanding, and established operations in Edmonton, Alberta and in Saudi Arabia. In 1978, and in the next three years that followed, EllisDon took on local projects that included the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario; Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta; a Bank of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario; and Peel Regional Police Headquarters and 22 Division in Brampton, Ontario‚Äì to name a few. By 1982 EllisDon was awarded a Construction Management Contract for the Metro Toronto Convention Centre project. It was after this that Don knew EllisDon had enough experience to take on a project that was of a much larger scale. In 1986 Don took a big risk and bet the entire company to bid on the Rogers Centre, formerly known as Skydome. Although the company faced many obstacles over the course of the project, it deemed very successful. The project was completed in three short years and on June 3, 1989 the Rogers Center officially opened its doors, making it the world's first retractable rooftop stadium. This project was Don's pride and joy and represented the height of his career. Just as fast as EllisDon was evolving, Don built a reputation for himself as well. He was known as a hard- driven boss with high expectations. Although he was demanding, Don took a big interest in their personal welfare too. He was highly involved in all facets of the company while maintaining close relationships with all of his employees. He frequently visited job sites to find out information about the projects and teams, but also to stay updated with what is going on in his employees' personal lives. Don knew the name of every employee, their spouse and their children. Regardless of their position, Don had a talent for treating everyone equally. Under Don's leadership, EllisDon has evolved into one of Canada's biggest construction names and has been responsible for many notable projects including the University of Western Ontario, the Metro Hall complex, and the Princess of Wales Theatre. In 1996, Don retired. His son Geoff Smith, took over EllisDon as President and CEO.  Philanthropy  Don was a strong advocate of giving back to the community and took pride in his social activity and philanthropy. Having grown up without a lot of money, he understood the challenges and fully committed himself to helping others in every way he could. Over his life, Don raised millions of dollars toward charitable causes and positively impacted the lives of many. He was known to not tolerate discrimination and he sought justice and fairness where it was due. In 1967, when Don was the President of the London Club, he took a stand against the discrimination of Jewish people who would not be admitted to the private club. Don partnered up with a Jewish lawyer, who put his name up for membership and fought relentlessly until the club would admit its first Jewish member. After a long fight with lots of resistance, Don succeeded. Immediately after, Jewish members were welcome in every private club in London. Don was an official supporter of Fanshawe College and Boys and Girls Club of London as well as many other charities and individuals. In 1974 Don began his long-term partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of London. EllisDon expanded its clubrooms in addition to building a new gym and swimming pool. He was also involved in other renovation and construction projects for the organization including the Don Smith Young Wing in 1995 and an Aquaplex in 2006. Although he came from a construction background, Don's involvement was mainly attributed to his fundraising efforts. In 2008, along with his Daughter, Lynne Cram, Don organized the Horizons Campaign to raise funds for the M.A.P. Program (My Action Plan for Education) that supports youth from Grade 4 to post-secondary school to achieve their academic goals.  Politics  Don also had a passion for politics. He was involved in the Ontario Liberal Party, and was elected party president Feb. 17, 1985, when he served as chief fundraiser for Premier David Peterson‚Äôs government. After 42 consecutive years under conservative rule, Don helped rebuild the Ontario Liberal Party and bring it back to prominence.  Death  On July 16, 2013, at 89 years old, Don died in London, Ontario as a result of an illness. A celebration of his life was held in his memory on July 23 at the London Hunt Club, and was attended by family, friends, and employees.  Awards  As a result of his feat against the discrimination of Jewish people in private London clubs in the late 1960s, Don was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews. In May, 2014, Don was inducted, posthumously, into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame as part of its 36th Class of Companion Inductees. This award recognizes Canadian business leaders for their financial success as well as contributions to Canadian business and society.

A. Warren and Thomas Cox against a group led by W. W. Brown that took place in Bellevue, Jackson County, Iowa Territory, on April 1, 1840. A large mural made by local artists commemorates the incident at the site of Brown's Hotel where it occurred. Political tensions in Bellevue dated back to 1837, when Yankee businessmen arrived at the town, causing tensions with the original settlers. The original settlers banded with wealthy hotelier W. W. Brown, who provided them with credit and an opportunity to work. A shooting on January 8, 1840, further intensified the situation. Brown previously attempted to usurp territory representative Thomas Cox as the Democrats' candidate in the 1840 election. This infuriated Cox, who drafted a warrant for Brown's arrest following the shooting incident. Sheriff W. A. Warren, a former political opponent of Brown himself, authorized a posse to apprehend Brown. After an attempt to negotiate, the posse moved in on Brown's hotel. Brown apparently accidentally discharged his weapon, causing a gunfight to break out. Three more were killed on each side. The posse set the hotel on fire and captured those who attempted to escape. They were sentenced to receive a whipping and commanded to leave the county. History =Tensions= The first settlers in Bellevue, Iowa Territory, were miners from Galena, Illinois and southerners who distrusted eastern Yankees. In the spring of 1837, a large group of Yankees from Coldwater, Michigan, settled in Bellevue, creating tensions between them and the original settlers. One new arrival, William W. Brown, came with a substantial fortune and purchased the only hotel in town. The original settlers appreciated Brown's hospitality and open-handedness with credit. Brown would also pay high wages every winter to have the original settlers haul wood over the iced Mississippi River. Thus, the settlers formed a strong association with Brown. Other Yankee settlers of Bellevue did not appreciate Brown's wealth. Brown was accused of acquiring wealth through dishonest methods. Some of the currency spent by Brown's associates was found to be counterfeit. Brown's associates in turn harassed those that accused Brown of wrongdoings. An increase in local cattle and horse rustlings made locals suspicious of Brown's group. In 1838, Brown announced his candidacy for Sheriff of Jackson County, where Bellevue was located. However, Whig William A. Warren of Burlington was able to secure the election. At the same election, Democrat Thomas Cox was elected as a representative to the first Iowa Territory general assembly. Brown was named a justice of the peace in 1839 and frequently defended his associates in court. The relationship at this point between Cox and Brown was considered cordial. Cox's opinion of Brown quickly soured. Ebenezer Brigham, a colleague of Cox's from Illinois who was currently serving on the Wisconsin territorial council, came to Bellevue to search for a friend's stolen horses. Sheriff Warren recognized the description as a pair that had recently been apprehended from a boarder in Brown's hotel. Cox was infuriated at what he perceived to be Brown's role in the affair. In late 1839 or early 1840, the Democratic Party held a caucus to determine a candidate from Jackson County for the territorial house. Cox was busy platting Iowa City, so he was not present. However, he expected to be easily renominated. Instead, the caucus settled on Brown as their candidate. This began a rivalry between Cox and Brown. Cox ran as an independent, accusing Brown of associating with criminals. Cox won the election, causing further tensions in Bellevue as opponents of Brown rallied to his side. =Shooting of James Thompson= Brown's associate James Thompson and Democrat James C. Mitchell got into a heated argument late in January 1840. Mitchell barricaded his house and put oak shutters on his windows to prevent Thompson from attacking. Mitchell also had a quarrel with one of his brothers. On January 8, the Democrats celebrated Jackson Day, which commemorated the Battle of New Orleans, and Mitchell was named the head of a celebratory ball. He explicitly forbid any allies of Brown from attending the affair, infuriating Brown's associates. During the ball, Mitchell's brother left to go to James' house, ostensibly to retrieve clothing from a trunk. He claimed that the trunk belonged to his own wife and claimed to have taken a justice of the peace with him to prove that he was not going to take anything that did not belong to him. He was accompanied by Thompson, who had been drinking excessively. Upon their arrival, Thompson found a lady in a bed and attempted to assault her. The lady escaped and told James Mitchell about what happened. Mitchell armed himself and encountered Thompson. Both men raised their guns and attempted to shoot. Thompson's gun failed to properly fire, but Mitchell's fired a round into Thompson's chest, killing him. Mitchell returned to the ball, fearful of retribution from Brown's associates. Absalom Montgomery, who had followed Thompson in an attempt to persuade him away from combat, reported the incident to the sheriff. Sheriff Warren promised protection to Mitchell as long as he was willing to show in court. The next morning, a coroner confirmed the cause of death. Mitchell was transferred to a justice office and charged with Thompson's murder. The case was scheduled to be heard at the next meeting of the circuit court. Mitchell was put in chains and left in a room in the justice office, as the county had no jail at the time. In the meantime, Cox helped to draft a warrant for the arrest of W. W. Brown and twenty-two associates for thieving, passing counterfeit money, robbing, and other charges. It was signed by Charles Harris, a justice of the peace living near Fulton. The Cox faction now had legal authority to arrest the Brown faction. =Posse= Cox consulted with Warren, who warned him that Brown had many friends in Bellevue, making an arrest difficult. When he learned of the warrant, Brown offered to turn himself in, but refused to divulge information about his associates. Cox held a meeting at the house of James L. Kirkpatrick to decide what to do. The group decided to form a posse to apprehend Brown's gang. Warren canvassed the county, urging prominent citizens to write to Brown to convince him to surrender his men. The sheriff deputized Cox to select forty men to appear on his behalf on April 1, 1840. Warren and Cox both rounded up men for the posse. Warren claimed that he only sought to arrest Brown, but Cox told prospective members that he wanted to drive Brown and his gang out of the county. Warren was only able to convince one man, while Cox recruited the others. Cox had many connections with military experience. His brother-in-law James Collins was a colonel in the Black Hawk War and many of his former soldiers worked in the Galena mines. Cox was able to convince many of them to join. Anson Harrington, who assisted with the drafting of the warrant, recruited three of his friends. Cox was also able to enlist the help of his neighbors. =Gunfight= When April 1 came, the two factions first attempted to negotiate through parlay. In the afternoon, Warren traveled to Brown's hotel to read the warrant. Shortly thereafter, Cox arrived with the posse. Although a large group of citizens were standing at Brown's defense, they quickly scattered when they saw Cox's posse marching with military discipline. Unable to come to terms, Warren left the hotel and Cox's posse advanced. Brown stood in the door of the hotel holding a rifle. Cox demanded his surrender, and apparently Brown complied and lowered his weapon. However, while doing so, he accidentally discharged it. The ensuing bullet ripped through Cox's coat. Two of Cox's associates, purportedly John T. Sublett and V. G. Smith, fired back, killing Brown. Brown's associates returned fire. During the exchange, the posse set the hotel on fire, prompting Brown's associates to flee. Between five and thirteen members of the gang were apprehended. =Aftermath= Three members of the posse were killed: Henderson Palmer, John Brink, and J. Maxwell. Another, William Vaughn, was seriously wounded. Two members of Brown's gang were killed: Aaron Day and Mr. Burtis. Brown's hostler, Tom Walch, was severely wounded. One civilian, Andrew Farley, was killed when tending to Day. Cox and Warren initially intended to hang the captives immediately, but decided to instead bury the dead, extinguish the fire, and wait for the next morning. The posse held a ballot to determine the fate of the captives. They were instructed to drop a white bean if they were in favor of hanging and a red bean if they were in favor of whipping. The final count was thirty-eight white beans to forty-two red beans. Captives received between four and thirty-nine lashes and then were sent down the Mississippi River on a board. They were commanded to never enter the county again. One member, William Fox, later joined the Banditti of the Prairie in Illinois. The posse was also subject to a trial, but the jury found that they acted within a reasonable interpretation of the law. Despite some public outrage over the incident, Cox was re-elected to the state house the next summer and was subsequently named Speaker of the House. He later served in the territory council (senate) before his death in 1844. Warren later reminisced that they had no evidence and that they did not want to arrest Warren. He remained sheriff until 1845.

The route begins at State Highway 17 (SH 17) and follows city streets within the city of Pecos in Reeves County ending at Business Interstate 20-B (Bus. I-20-B). FM 761 begins at SH 17 and follows southeast along Stafford Boulevard, a two-lane street, passing Reeves County Hospital before turning northeast onto South Eddy Street. At that point it becomes a mixed residential and commercial five-lane street including a center left-turn lane. Beyond West Walthall Street, the route turns toward the northwest passing the Pecos Technical Training Center of Odessa College. Beyond West 7th Street the roadway becomes a three-lane street with a left-turn lane before terminating at Bus. I-20-B. FM 761 was designated on January 27, 1948 as a highway from SH 17 along its current path on Stafford Boulevard and Eddy Street terminating at 8th Street. The route was extended to its current end at Bus. I-10-B on August 26, 1989. FM 761 will be modified on July 30, 2020. FM 762 Farm to Market Road 762 (FM 762) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that stays within Fort Bend County.

FM 762 begins at a stop sign on FM 1462\\\\. At the intersection, southbound traffic on FM 762 can use a right-hand curve to access FM 1462 going west. After traveling north of the starting point, there is an intersection with Texas Park Road 72 at the entrance of Brazos Bend State Park. From the state park, FM 762 heads north, west, north and northwest for before reaching a three-way junction with FM 1994\\\\. In the northwesterly stretch, the highway crosses Big Creek and passes under electric transmission lines. At the intersection, FM 762 turns sharply to the northeast, then northwest, then northeast again before passing the George Ranch and curving to the north-northwest. The highway passes the George Ranch High School of the Lamar Consolidated Independent School District before crossing the BNSF Railway tracks and arriving at a stoplight-controlled intersection with FM 2759\\\\. From FM 1994 to FM 2759 at Crabb is a distance of . At the intersection, FM 762 turns sharply left and parallels the BNSF tracks to the west-northwest for before coming to a stoplight at FM 2977\\\\. As highway starts to curve to the northwest, it crosses a bridge over I-69/US 59 at a distance of from the junction with FM 2977\\\\. There are shopping centers on the west side of the highway on both sides of I-69/US 59, which is locally called the Southwest Freeway. I-69/US 59 may be accessed in both directions via entrance ramps on the east side of FM 762\\\\. From I-69/US 59 at exit 103B, FM 762 heads to the northwest alongside the railroad tracks for to reach the traffic signal at FM 1640\\\\. The George Memorial Library is located on the east side of the intersection. From FM 1640, the highway continues nearly north to the stoplight on US 90A at Jackson Street. There is also a spur connection which turns east onto Austin Street for several blocks, then north on Second Street to terminate at the west end of the Brazos River bridge on US 90A. FM 762 was designated on December 17, 1947, to start from US 59 at Richmond, go first to Crabb and then south to the Tadpole Road in the direction of Long Point. The total distance was and the leg from Crabb to the south was in length. The end location was at the 2013 site of the intersection of FM 762 and FM 1994.This was determined by measuring 8.9 miles of map distance on the 2013 highway starting from Crabb. Note that a 1955 map shows that US 59 shared the same route that is used by US 90A in 2013, which is about north of the 2013 path of US 59. On July 22, 1949, FM 762 was extended toward Long Point. On May 23, 1951, FM 762 was extended south approximately to the county line and then an additional into Brazoria County to SH 36 near Damon. At that time, the highway's total distance was . On October 10, 1961, the last segment of the highway going northeast from Damon was transferred to FM 1462\\\\. The total length of the highway was in 1961. On August 27, 1963, a spur connection in Richmond was made by routing the highway east on Austin Street and north on South 2nd Street to US 59 (now US 90A).

It travels approximately from an intersection with US 84/TX 110 in Rusk north through Gallatin, then northwestward into Jacksonville where it intersects US 69\\\\. The road is located in north-central Cherokee County. FM 768 has five local street names: Henderson Street in Rusk; Chandler Street and 1st Avenue (at its concurrence with FM 22) in Gallatin; and Corinth Road, Beaumont Street, and Adams Street in Jacksonville. The highway is an urban at each terminus and mostly rural for the rest of its length. FM 768 passes by a landscape of rolling hills of trees and farmland. While somewhat winding between Rusk and Gallatin, FM 768 is much more so with several twisty corners between Gallatin and Jacksonville. All of FM 768 has 2 lanes and no shoulders. The first section of FM 768, from the US 69 intersection southeastward for was commissioned by Minute Order on September 9, 1947, then another Minute Order added on October 28, 1953, more, intersecting the road with FM 22 in Gallatin. On April 21, 1958, FM 854 was cancelled and the mileage added to FM 768's to extend the road to Rusk. It is unclear, exactly when any part of FM 768 was built. The road serves just the 3 towns of Rusk, Gallatin, and Jacksonville. The southern terminus connects to US 84/SH 110\\\\. The northern terminus intersection connects to US 69\\\\. FM 768 only has intersections at county roads, besides its concurrency with FM 22 in Gallatin, its crossing of Loop 456, and its termini.

The road has major intersections with US 82, US 380, and FM 1585\\\\. FM 769 was formerly part of a much longer route that included the current SH 125 and was unofficially signed as SH 125 for several decades. FM 769 begins at SH 83 near the point where SH 83 crosses the New Mexico state line and meets NM 132 west of Denver City in southwestern Yoakum County. FM 769 continues northward closely following the state line and crossing US 82 southwest of Plains. The road continues north along the state link intersecting US 380 at Bronco northwest of Plains before crossing into Cochran County. The road then intersects FM 1585 before the road ends at SH 125 near the point where SH 125 meets NM 125 southwest of Bledsoe. FM 769 passes through mostly agricultural lands and oil and gas fields across the largely flat and featureless terrain of the Llano Estacado. FM 769 was designated on November 18, 1947 from US 290 (now SH 114) at Whiteface to SH 214 in Lehman. On April 1, 1948, the road was extended to the New Mexico state line the following year, while also being extended south from Whiteface to an intersection with a road that two years later would become FM 301. On October 18, 1948 the road was extended north 0.36 mile to SH 24 (now SH 114), replacing Spur 74. On December 17, 1952 the road was extended south 9.7 miles along the New Mexico state line to a road intersection. On March 30, 1955 FM 769 was signed (but not designated) as SH 125 as it connected with NM 125 at the state line.

The following day, the crew of the vessel overpowered the pirates with the support of a U.S. naval vessel.  Seizure  The incident took place about northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. A group of Somali pirates boarded and captured the North Korean cargo ship Dai Hong Dan. According to North Korean sources, the ship had unloaded its cargo in the Somali capital when seven armed pirates (disguised as guards) boarded the ship, detaining the 22 sailors of the crew in the steering room and an engine room. They then forced the ship to sea and demanded a ransom of USD$15,000.  Revolt  The following day, responding to the vessel's distress signal, the American destroyer approached the ship and deployed a SH-60B helicopter and a VBSS (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) team to secure the scene. Meanwhile, the North Korean sailors attacked their captors, seizing some weapons. A prolonged gunfight between the sailors and the pirates resulted in the pirates' defeat. One or two pirates were killed in the engagement, and the others were captured (three were wounded). Of the six Korean sailors wounded, three required medical treatment, which was provided by American medical personnel.  Aftermath  The North Korean press (KCNA) released an unprecedented positive statement, expressing gratitude to the United States for their help, and emphasizing the successful US‚ÄìNorth Korean collaboration during the incident.

The Petit Ried (occasionally referred to as Ried-Nord) is located in north-eastern Alsace. It stretches between the Robertsau Forest in Strasbourg in the south, and Lauterbourg in the north. It borders on Outre- For√™t. The Petit Ried shows a typical Ried landscape. It spreads over a narrow strip along the Rhine River. It is accessible thanks to the railway Strasbourg-Lauterbourg, as well as the motorway A35 between Hoerdt and Lauterbourg. In the Petit Ried, three rivers flow into the Rhine River: * the Ill in Offendorf * the Moder in Beinheim * the Sauer in Munchhausen, which actually takes its source in Germany To the east, the Black Forest with the Hornisgrinde stands out against the horizon. The Vosges are more inconspicuous because they lie farther away, and are not as high as the Black Forest. The Petit Ried is densely populated, and is relatively rich, as many cross-border workers live there.  Baggersee  Numerous sand and gravel pits (which are locally called Baggersee, as in nearby Germany ) are in operation (in la Wantzenau, Hoerdt and Offendorf for instance). Old pits are still used for recreational activities like bathing (in Reichstett, Bischheim and in Gambsheim, for instance) or diving.  Nature reserves  Two national nature reserves are located in the Petit Ried, more precisely: * Sauer delta Nature Reserve in Munchhausen * Offendorf Forest Nature Reserve in Offendorf  Fish pass  Both dams in Iffezheim (D) and in Gambsheim (F) are equipped with a fish pass. In Gambsheim, it is possible to observe fish migration in a small museum. Downstream of Beinheim, there are no more dams, which explains why the zone between Beinheim and Lauterbourg is so interesting from an environmental point of view. This is the place where the Sauer Delta Nature Reserve is located. But the Rhine is still subjected to the needs of navigation.  Renewable energies  The starch manufacturer Roquette Fr√®res in Beinheim is supplied with heat from the terrestrial heat plant in Rittershoffen.Usine nouvelle. The dams in Gambsheim and Iffezheim produce electricity. In Gambsheim the French grid is fed, whereas the German grid is fed in Iffezheim. The biogas produced by the sewage plant in Strasbourg is fed into the French gas network.Green Gas for Strasbourg (French)  Tourism  There are tourism offices in Gambsheim, Soufflenheim, Seltz and Lauterbourg. Soufflenheim is renowned for its coloured Alsatian potteries. In Offendorf a barge houses the inland water shipping Museum. The Gambsheim locks are equipped with France's largest sluices.

It is part of the best French academic institutions known as Grandes √©coles specialized in engineering and sciences and is a university level institution with the special status Grands √©tablissements. It is under supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research and jointly managed by the chamber of commerce of Rouen, the Society of Engineers in Electrical Engineering (from French \\"Soci√©t√© des Ing√©nieurs en G√©nie √âlectrique\\", SIGELEC), and a consortium of private companies. History In 1901, Alexandre Charliat, an engineer from √âcole Centrale Paris, decided to create a school of engineers corresponding to its own perspective on education.http://www.sigelec.asso.fr/sigelec/presentation He named it the Practical School of Industrial Electricity (from French \\"√âcole Pratique d'√âlectricit√© Industrielle\\") and established it at 53 rue Belliard in Paris. The school later became the School of Industrial Electricity of Paris (from French EEIP \\"√âcole d'√âlectricit√© Industrielle de Paris\\"). It will change one last time of name in 1980, and becomes the Superior School of Electrical Engineers (√âcole Sup√©rieure d'Ing√©nieurs en G√©nie √âLECtrique, ESIGELEC). The Ministry of Higher Education and Research recognizes the school as a Grandes √©coles in 1922 and the Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur authorizes it to award the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur in 1936. In 1989, ESIGELEC becomes a permanent member of the Grande Ecole conference (Conf√©rence des grandes √©coles). In 2011, ESIGELEC becomes an associate school of the Institut Mines-T√©l√©com (Mines T√©l√©com Institut of Technology) and the Groupe des √©coles des mines. The Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur renews its capacitation to grant the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur in 2014 for the maximal duration of 6 years. The school resettles many times. The first resettlement happened in 1968 and saw all the components of the school moved to Beauvais. Then, the board of directors understood that the only way to develop the school with its very own educational values was to relocate it far from Paris and all the parisian schools of engineers. They decided to move to Mont-Saint-Aignan, a city close from Rouen, in 1991. This genius idea also benefits directly to students as apartment rentals are much higher in the capital. In 2004, funding is released to offer the school its own state of the art facilities. The school relocates in the Technop√¥le du Madrillet, in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray, south of Rouen, an area dedicated to innovation with many companies and three academic institutions. The staff and students moved into the new buildings 16 September 2005, day of the inauguration. Status ESIGELEC is a semi-private school of engineers. It is under supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research but is co-led by the chamber of commerce of Rouen. It has been created as a nonprofit organization according to the law of 1901. Therefore, students have to make a contribution to the student fee partially paid by private and public funds and the school cannot be profitable. Education =Degrees= Prep School ESIGELEC has an integrated Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles accessible after the Baccalaur√©at. Engineering cycle ESIGELEC is capacitaded by the Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur to award a Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieurhttp://extranet.cti- commission.fr/recherche/ListEcoleShow/ecole/136 which is equivalent to a master's degree. As French Government requires it, it is awarded after three years of study. Eligible applicants are students having successfully achieved the prep school, a two-year Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles or an equivalent university level. =Unions= Schools of engineers in France are known to promote student life in order to create strong relations between students and allow them to do things they could not do at Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles, the two-year of intense study preceding the entry in the engineering cycle. ESIGELEC strengthen this reputation by investing money in student unions. The student bureau or student union office (from French \\" Bureau Des El√®ves \\", BDE) is elected every year in May by the students. It consists of second year students of the engineering cycle gathering in lists and campaigning to obtain the management of the union office. The campaign lasts one week and implies an important organisation. The student bureau has in charge to organize the integration week (a program to welcome the incoming students) and to finance the other unions of the school. The unions of the school are: *La Tortue D√©chain√©e: The newspaper of ESIGELEC. *ESIG‚ÄôAERO: The union for those who love planes and parachuting. *Gala ESIGELEC *Defi 24h *4L Trophy *Club Zik Research ESIGELEC is one of the few French schools to have its own research center. It is in 2001 that the Research Institute for Embedded Electronic Systems (from French \\"Institut de Recherche en Syst√®mes Electroniques Embarqu√©s\\", IRSEEM) is created, a research laboratory specialized on embedded systems. In 2010, the laying of the foundation stone of a state of the art research facility is made to create the Embedded Systems Integration Campus (from French \\"Campus d'Int√©gration des Syst√®mes Embarqu√©s\\", CISE). It is inaugurated in 2012. This center, dedicated to electrical systems and mecatronics, reinforces the range of research and teaching capabilities of both ESIGELEC and IRSEEM.

At one point, Mataemon attempted and almost locked a juji-gatame, but Nagaoka's defense and their position near the bounds of the tatami impeded the technique. The match was declared a draw.

Both the hall and estate privately owned. The house is close to the village of Matlask in the English County of Norfolk in the United Kingdom. The house was built for Sir Edward Paston in 1612 although the house seen today is the result of renovations, alterations and enlargement carried out under the control and design of Humphry Repton and his architect son John Adey Repton in 1805.  Description  The hall stands within its 4,000 acre estate and was remodelled in 1805 by the Reptons. The main body of the structure is built in red brick with stone dressings. The west facing fa√ßade has five bays with the central bay used as the porch and front entrance to the house. This fa√ßade dates from the early house built by Paston. The porch has polygonal angled buttresses to each corner topped with finials. The bays continue up through the steep roof to form two storey dormers giving the hall an impression of height. The porch has a semicircular porch arch in stone, bearing the original halls construction date of 1612. The porch rises to the same height to give the fa√ßade symmetry. All the windows have stone mullions, transoms and pediments over the windows. The south facing fa√ßade was extensively re-modelled by the John Adey Repton. He added bays and replaced the windows although the crowstep gables with polygonal buttresses to the quoins are all survived from the original house. He also changed the east fa√ßade to include a simpler version of the crowstep gables in 1810. At this time Repton also added an extension to the east side of the hall which contained a kitchen and a gun room. Below the ground floor of the hall are the original enfilade cellars. The cellars have two staircase, one from the wine cellar to the kitchen and another to the principle entertaining rooms on the ground floor. On the roof there are polygonal chimneys with star shaped toppings. They sit upon a roof of plain red tiles with a castellated brick cornice around the eves = Other estate buildings = To the north of the hall is the coach house and stable block which are connected to the hall with high brick wall on the west and service building to the east. The stable and coach house are in an L shape and range to the north and the east of the courtyard and are both Grade II listed buildings. The east block which was the stable block has a wooden clock turret with a bell under a leaded cupola over a crow-stepped gabled bay. Either side are this central bay there are smaller crow-stepped gabled bay. The building is built in red Norfolk brick with a tile and pantile (Rear) roof. The northern side building was the coach house and coachman‚Äôs cottage. The building is over three storeys and has three bays with equal sized crow-stepped gables. With dormers. It is built in red brick with some diaper decorative pattern built into the brick bond. The roof is of plain red tile with fish tail tiles to the front  History  = Curzun Family = After a period of time following the great survey known as the Domesday Book the manor of Barningham was in the ownership by William de Curzun. Curzun lived in the reign of Henry II. He was followed by Ralph Curzun and Sir Robert Curzun all of whom were lord of the manor. In 1345 the lands and manor of Barningham was in the ownership of John de Reppes. By 1361 the ownership had passed to William and Maude Wynter. = Wynter family = The hall that stands today was built in 1612 on land owned by the Wynter family and replaced a house which was demolished and stood a short distance from the present building. The old house had been the property of the Wynter family for many generations. The first member of the Wynter family of any note was William Wynter who twice served as the High Sheriff of the bailiwick of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1380 and 1392. He is recorded as owning the house and manor of Barningham Winter and when he died his son John Wynter inherited the manor of Barningham Winter along with the house. He was also lord of the manors of Matlask, Bessingham, Wickmere, Plumstead, Aldborough, and Baconsthorpe. His father also owned the manors of Egmere and Wighton and it is assumed that John was also lord at these places. John Wynter was a lawyer and worked in Royal administration, beginning seven years before King Richard II was overthrown. He served Richard for three terms as escheator. Following the deposition of Richard, Wynter was shrewd enough to support the return of Henry Bolingbroke in July 1399 to become King Henry IV of England. John Wynter died in 1414 leaving the house and estate to his son Edmund Wynter. Edmund was also in the legal profession and he died in 1448. In his will he left the manor house and all its contents to his widow as a life interest with it all being passed on to his eldest son John Wynter after her death. The house and title passed down several generations of Wynter‚Äôs until the reign of Elizabeth I when the house and manor was sold to Sir Edward Paston. = The Pastons = The Paston family were a well connected and influential family in Norfolk. The patriarch Sir William Paston (1528‚Äì1610) who was the founder of the Paston Grammar School in North Walsham owned Caister Castle, Paston Hall and Oxnead Hall. Another member of the family, Sir Edward Paston (1550‚Äì1630), built and owned Appleton hall in 1599 and was on part of what is now the Sandringham Estate. In 1612 the existing manor house and estate at Barningham was acquired by another Paston Family member. His name was Sir Edward Paston (1550 ‚Äì 1630) and he had the old Wynter manor house demolished and a new larger hall built a short distance from the old manor. Edward Paston died in 1630 at the age of 80. he left the house and estate to Clement Paston who was his grandson. He in turned left it to another Edward Paston. The fortunes of the Paston family declined by the 1730s. William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth (1654-1732) had converted to Anglicanism in 1689, but refused to swear allegiance to William and Mary and had subsequently lost all his offices. When he died he left the family with enormous debts and huge mortgages on the Paston Properties. In this financial confusion, Edward Paston abandoned the estate and hall at Barningham in 1736. It remained empty for the next twenty years and was sold in 1756 to settle Edward Paston‚Äôs debts. = Subsequent ownership = The house and estate were purchased from Paston by William Russell from London, who was a whale bone merchant who also had interests in the West Indies. Roughly crushed whale bones were used to renovate pastures in Britain in the late eighteenth century and used extensively in East Anglia creating huge profits for the bone merchants. Russell was one such gentleman. Kings Lynn was a major port for the whale industry and there were several whale bone and oil processing mills in the area including Narborough and Congham. Barningham Hall was an ideal location for Russell being close to these whale business operations. However Russell only held the property for 19 years and he sold the estate to Thomas Lane in 1775. Ten years later in 1785 Lane sold the estate to Thomas Vertue Mott. The Hall and estate has remained with this family until the present day.

Early life  Bridges was born on 9 July 1922 near Bedford, the son of Sir Ernest Bridges, a commodore of Royal Mail Lines. He was educated at Bedford School.  Military service  Bridges was commissioned into the Royal Artillery after he left school. He was attached to the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) and served with them in Burma. He fought in the Arakan Campaign, where he was involved in a five-month journey that involved crossing ten rivers. According to The Telegraph, he recalled one occasion when the man standing next to him was killed, and another where he escaped an ambush only to encounter the enemy again running in the opposite direction. He was demobilised in 1946.  Legal career  After his military service, Bridges qualified as a solicitor in the United Kingdom. In 1954, he was posted to the Gambia Colony and Protectorate as a lands officer. He worked as Registrar General and Assistant Attorney General before becoming Solicitor General in 1963 and Attorney General in 1964. He helped draft the Gambian constitution prior to independence. The Gambia became independent in 1965, but Bridges remained in his post until 1968. This was unusual for post-independence African countries and he was the only European in the Gambian cabinet after independence. Bridges was appointed as Chief Justice of the Gambia in 1968 and continued in this role until 1983. He earned a reputation for \\"fairness, tolerance, and above all, kindness.\\" He learned the Wolof language while in the country. At one point, as Chief Justice, he reportedly earned the anger of Dawda Jawara, President of the Gambia, for recalling Hugh Latimer's warning before being burned at the stake in 1555: \\"Corruption bringeth rebellion.\\" He was described as \\"an anomaly of Gambian tolerance\\" by The New York Times in 1977. Bridges was made a Queen's Counsel in 1964, was appointed CMG in 1967, and was knighted in 1973. He was also made an Honorary Commander of the National Order of The Republic of The Gambia (CRG) by Dawda Jawara.  Retirement and death  He retired to England in 1983 and became the representative of The Gambia Legion in the UK and an honorary legal advisor to the British Ex-Commonwealth Services League. He contributed a chapter to The Gambia's Studies in Politics and Society, published in 1991. He died in December 2007 in Suffolk. Writing in 2012, Hassan Bubacar Jallow said that Bridges' \\"sense of justice and fair play, his personal integrity and deep dedication to the Gambian people were never at any time in question during his long career.\\"  References  Category:1922 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People educated at Bedford School Category:British judges Category:English barristers Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Lawyers awarded knighthoods Category:Queen's Counsel 1901‚Äì2000 Category:Colonial Legal Service officers Category:British judges on the courts of the Gambia Category:Royal Artillery personnel Category:Royal West African Frontier Force officers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Chief Justices of the Gambia Category:Gambia Colony and Protectorate people ","title":"Phillip Bridges"},{"id":"43683811","text":"Terry Daniel is a former American football punter who played college football at Auburn University.

He was matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1870, and graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1880 (made Master of Arts in 1887). In 1879 he was ordained a deacon in Ripon, West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1881 he was ordained as a priest. From 1879 to 1882 he was chaplain in Sharow, near Ripon, and from 1882 to 1883 he was chaplain in Chearsley, Buckinghamshire. From 1883 to 1893 he was parish priest in Irchester.

Natural history work  In 1874 he accompanied the botanist Isaac Bayley Balfour and George Gulliver aboard HMS Shearwater on an expedition to observe the transit of Venus on Rodrigues. In addition to studies of the flora and fauna, Slater excavated the subfossil bones of extinct birds, including the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) and Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus). His records were used by the zoologists Albert G√ºnther and Alfred Newton to write the first scientific description of the Rodrigues starling in 1879. During a stay in Mauritius in 1875 he and George Gulliver explored the flora, the herpetofauna, and the aquatic avifauna. In 1885 he traveled with Thomas Carter to Iceland. Based partly on his work there, he wrote the Manual of the Birds of Iceland, published in 1901. In 1897 Slater described the short-tailed parrotbill (Paradoxornis davidianus) and the sulphur-breasted warbler (Phylloscopus ricketti). Together with William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and Frederick William Frohawk, he wrote the fifth volume of British Birds With Their Nests and Eggs (1898).

She published her first book, The Huckleberry Book in 1988. Nine years later, her best known work, Wolf: The Journey Home was published. From 1988 to 2001, she published a column in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. She now teaches composition in Kalispell, Montana. Personal experience The wolf myth 'Asta Bowen writes young-adult fiction, with a focus on the myth of the wolf. In Wolf: The Journey Home, there is a scene where a wolf body allows to find the killer has been compared by the professor of American Literature and American Studies S. K. Robisch to a real poaching in the Yellowstone Park, against one male of the Druids wolf pack, named from Druid Peak, the first reintroduced in this park in 1996, where the killer has been apprehended because he kept the head as a trophy. In the same study of wolf in American literature, he credits 'Asta Bowen to correctly portraits the role of the den location, to raise the new litter. There is virtually no anthropomorphism in this novel, the author describes real wolves, with some notable exceptions, deemed to be at the border of anthropomorphism, for example giving to the wolves names like Marth or Oldtooth. British historian Karen Jones, specialized in the history of the American West, environmental history and Animal Studies, stresses upon the importance of such works in the environmental values transmission. She notes works like 'Asta Bowen ‚Äúcontain descriptions of intelligent canine protagonists that countered the images of bestial excess in traditional Euro- American wolf tales.‚Äù. Jones also notes, more strongly than Robisch the ‚Äúhumanistic traits‚Äù of the wolves: in Wolf: The Journey Home, she sees Marta as an ‚Äúeco-feminist icon, a strong female character‚Äù and as ‚Äútotem for positive gender identity‚Äù. Finally, she compares the myth to the Turner's Frontier Thesis: ‚ÄúBowen‚Äôs fictionalised rendition of lupine restoration involved copious quantities of pain, struggle, and death. This was a damming verdict on Turnerian triumphalism. Here the wolf story showed a West not won but lost. In Bowen‚Äôs work, the wolf emerged as a potent signifier of frontier guilt, an expression that also proved common in commentary on the wolf reintroduction programme in Yellowstone in the mid-1990s.‚Äù Work reception Her first novel, Wolf: The Journey Home, is well received and was nominated for the 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association.

Career Mark received a B.S. degree in chemistry from Williams College (1979) and a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley (1983). He spent the next four years as a postdoctoral researcher at two institutions, Oregon State University (1984‚Äì1985) with Prof. Joseph W. Nibler and the University of Chicago (1985‚Äì1987) with Prof. Graham R. Fleming. In 1987 Mark received his first academic appointment, as assistant professor at the Pennsylvania State University (1987‚Äì1993). In 1993 he was appointed associate professor, and in 1997 he was made a full professor. Research Prof. Maroncelli's research interests include solvation and solvent effects on chemical reaction, liquid- phase dynamics, electron and proton transfer reactions, supercritical fluids and expanded liquids, ionic liquids, ultrafast spectroscopy, and computer simulation. Maroncelli‚Äôs research seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular nature of solvation and how it affects chemical reactions taking place in solution. Solvation involves the interactions between dissolved molecules (solutes) and molecules of the solvent. Favorable arrangements of solvent molecules around the solute lower its energy, which leads to dissolution. The interactions involved are typically very rapid, taking place in as short a time as 1 ps (10^-12 s). Because the key steps in most chemical reactions also occur on these fast time scales, time-dependent aspects of solvation partly determine how a solvent influences the rate and course of chemical reactions. Maroncelli uses ultrafast spectroscopic techniques in combination with modern computational-chemistry methods to observe, analyze, and predict the solvation process and its impact on the chemical steps that occur during the particular reaction being investigated. Maroncelli‚Äôs recent research has explored the nature of solvation in novel solvents such as supercritical fluids, gas-expanded liquids, and ionic liquids. Comparing model reactions such as isomerization, electron transfer, and proton transfer in these novel solvents with such reactions in conventional liquids enables his research team to test and extend the current understanding of solvent-reaction coupling. These studies have potential applications in technical chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and cell biology.

She was the winner of the first prize in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 2010, releasing her first album, C√©cile, shortly thereafter. Her second album, WomanChild, was released in 2013 on Mack Avenue Records, receiving a 2014 Grammy Award nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album. Salvant won four categories in the 2014 Down Beat Critics Poll: Jazz Album of the Year, Female Vocalist, Rising Star‚ÄìJazz Artist, and Rising Star‚ÄìFemale Vocalist. Her third album, For One to Love, was released on September 5, 2015, to critical acclaim from the New York Times, The Guardian, and Los Angeles Times.Chinen, Nate, \\"Review: C√©cile McLorin Salvant Wields Her Power, Drawing From Her Album ‚ÄòFor One to Love‚Äô\\", New York Times, August 26, 2015.Lewis, John, \\"C√©cile McLorin Salvant: For One to Love review ‚Äì more like heightened music-theatre than jazz\\", The Guardian, September 3, 2015.Wood, Mikael, \\"Review: Cecile McLorin Salvant is still pushing herself with 'For One to Love'\\", Los Angeles Times, September 5, 2015. It won her the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2016. Early years C√©cile Sophie McLorin Salvant was born in Miami, Florida. Her father, who is Haitian, is a doctor and her mother, who is French, is the founder and president of a French immersion school in Miami. Salvant began studies in classical piano at the age of five, and began singing in the Miami Choral Society when she was eight. She subsequently developed an interest in classical voice and began studying with private instructors, and later with Edward Walker, vocal teacher at the University of Miami. She has said: \\"I was lucky enough to grow up in a house where we listened to all kinds of music. We listened to Haitian, hip hop, soul, classical jazz, gospel and Cuban music, to name a few. When you have access to that as a child, it just opens up your world.\\" In 2007, Salvant moved to Aix-en-Provence, France, to study law as well as classical and baroque voice at the Darius Milhaud Conservatory. It was in Aix-en-Provence, with reedist and teacher , that she studied improvisation, instrumental and vocal repertoire, and sang with her first band. In a four-star review of her sold-out engagement at Ronnie Scott's Club in London in June 2015, John Fordham wrote in The Guardian: \\"She brings ideas from unexpected angles to the familiar art of standards-singing, and she applies a mischievous intelligence to well-worn lyrics in ways that transform them.\\"  Musical career  Salvant began studying voice at the age of eight with an interest in classical music. She began her transition into jazz while studying at the Darius Milhaud Conservatory in 2007, and also studied composition and music theory at The New School. Chinen, Kaplan, Fred \\"C√©cile McLorin Salvant‚Äôs Timeless Jazz\\", The New Yorker, May 15, 2017.Salvant says that her main jazz influence is Sarah Vaughan, recalling childhood memories of listening to her songs repeatedly. While strongly influenced by Sarah Vaughan, she is also heavily influenced by vocalists such as Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith, and Betty Carter. She describes her sound as jazz, blues, with elements of folk and musical theatre. She composes music and lyrics which she also sings in French, her native language, as well as in Spanish. She enjoys popularity in Europe and in the United States, performing in clubs, concert halls, and festivals accompanied by renowned musicians. Salvant has performed at jazz venues and festivals including Ronnie Scott's,Lauren, Jade, \\"Cecile McLorin Salvant at Ronnie Scott's\\", London Jazz News, October 8, 2013. the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island, and the Village Vanguard.Chinen, Nate, \\"C√©cile McLorin Salvant, With Refined Power, Performs at the Jazz Standard\\", The New York Times, August 19, 2015. In 2010, Salvant released her first self-titled album C√©cile & the Jean-Fran√ßois Bonnel Paris Quintet. Soon thereafter, at the age of 21, she went on to win the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition for vocalists. Her first-prize win included a recording contract with the label Mack Avenue Records, with whom she released her next two albums. Writing in The New York Times in 2012, Ben Ratliff said: \\"In front of a trio led by the pianist Aaron Diehl she sings clearly, with her full pitch range, from a pronounced low end to full and distinct high notes, used sparingly [...] Her voice clamps into each song, performing careful variations on pitch, stretching words but generally not scatting; her face conveys meaning, representing sorrow or serenity like a silent-movie actor.\\" In 2013 she released her second album WomanChild, which was nominated for a 2014 Grammy Award in the category of Best Vocal Jazz Album. The songs chosen for WomanChild include original compositions, as well as compositions that date back to the 19th century and progress into the 21st. Salvant chose the songs for this album based on songs she felt had a personal connection to her life. In September 2015, Salvant released her second album with Mack Avenue Records, titled For One to Love. On this album, she chose songs that focus attention on strong women and independence. The album contains five original works and jazz standards. In 2016, the album won a Grammy for Best Vocal Jazz Album. Two years later, her third album with Mack Avenue, Dreams and Daggers, won a Grammy in the same category. She has toured with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, whose music director Wynton Marsalis was quoted in a 2017 New Yorker article as saying of Salvant: \\"You get a singer like this once in a generation or two.\\" Salvant has sung in advertisements for Chanel's \\"Chance\\" brand of products.

Built around a disassembler for computer software which generates assembly language source code from machine-executable code, it supports a variety of executable formats for different processor architectures and operating systems.  History  Radare2 was created in February 2006, aiming to provide a free and simple command-line interface for a hexadecimal editor supporting 64 bit offsets to make searches and recovering data from hard-disks, for forensic purposes. Since then, the project has grown with the aim changed to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries while adhering to several principles of the Unix philosophy. In 2009, the decision was made to completely rewrite it, to get around limitations in the initial design. Since then, the project continued to grow, and attracted several resident developers. In 2016, the first r2con took place in Barcelona, gathering more than 100 participants, featuring various talks about various features and improvements of the framework. Radare2 has been the focus of multiple presentations at several high-profile security conferences, like the recon, hack.lu, 33c3.  Features and usage  Radare2 has a steep learning curve since it does not have a GUI by itself. Originally built around a hexadecimal editor, it has now a multitude of tools and features, and also bindings for several languages.Git repository for radare2's bindings Meanwhile it has a WebUIThe new web interface and there is an external Qt GUI called Cutter (formerly named Iaito).Cutter = Static analysis = Radare2 is able to assemble and disassemble a lot of things, but it can also perform binary diffing with graphs,\\"Binary Diffing\\" visual en Linux con Radare2 extract information like relocations symbols, and various other types of data. Internally, it uses a NoSQL database named sdb to keep track of analysis information that can be inferred by radare2 or manually added by the user. Since it is able to deal with malformed binaries, it has also been used by software security researchers for analysis purposes.AlienVault - OSX/Leverage.a AnalysisCraig Heffner - Finding and Reversing Backdoors in Consumer FirmwarePHDays IV, May 21, 2014, 'Anton Kochkov', Application of radare2 illustrated by Shylock/Caphaw.D and Snakso.A analysis = Dynamic analysis = Radare2 has a built-in debugger, that is lower-level than the classic GDB. However, it can also interface itself with the GNU debugger, or even WineDBGGmane archive about WinDBG support in radare2 to debug Windows binaries on other systems. It is even possible to use it as a kernel-debugger with VMWare. Also there is a support for the WinDBG protocol. = Software exploitation = Since it features a disassembler and a low-level debugger, radare2 can be useful to developers of exploits. The software has features which assist in exploit development, such as a ROP gadget search engine and mitigation detection. Because of the software's flexibility and support for many file formats, it is often used by capture the flag teamsDragon SectorLSE and other security-oriented personnel.Phrack - manual binary mangling with radare Radare2 can also assist in creating shellcodes with its 'ragg2' tool, similar to metasploit. = Cutter = Cutter is the first official graphical user interface (GUI) for radare2. It is still a young project that is mostly aimed \\"on those who[se] are not yet radare2 users because of the learning curve, because they don't like CLI applications or because of the difficulty/instability of radare2\\". It's the successor of the formerly known project Iaito that suffered from too little maintenance after it became open source on GitHub. Later on Iaito was forked and heavily rewritten, again with C++ and Qt as its base. These design choices enable it to be a cross platform application targeting Linux, MacOS as well as Windows. At the same time it was renamed to Cutter. Cutter's goal is to export the extensive functionality of radare2 to a modern user friendly GUI that can compete with other major static and dynamic analysis frameworks like Hex-Rays Interactive Disassembler, or Binary Ninja.

His first art lessons came from Philipp Friedrich von Hetsch, who was resting in Enns at the home of one of R√∂sers relatives, on the way back to Germany from Italy. In 1805, he was apprenticed to a decorative house painter in Linz, where he was able to take drawing lessons on Sundays. He was offered a place at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, but couldn't accept for lack of adequate financial support. He remained with the house painter until he became a journeyman. Faced with military conscription, he fled to Frankfurt where he found work in a tin factory, painting portraits of famous people on cans and cups. He also worked on making connections for his personal career but, with business down due to the Russian Campaign, he lost his job and moved to Stuttgart, where he worked as a portrait painter. By 1816, he had earned enough to make a visit home, then returned to Stuttgart after a short stay in Karlsruhe. Once he was settled there, he was able to obtain the patronage of the Duchess Wilhelmine, wife of Duke William Frederick Philip of W√ºrttemberg. Their sons, Count Alexander and Count Wilhelm (Later the Duke of Urach), were also frequent customers. During this time, he travelled extensively; visiting Belgium, Paris and Rome, where he painted Pope Leo XII. In 1830, he built his own home and hosted salons with many notable guests from the fields of art, music and theater such as Nikolaus Lenau, Franz von Dingelstedt and Friedrich Wilhelm Hackl√§nder. In 1838, he married. Eventually, commissions for his portraits extended throughout the nobility, the upper civil service and theatrical circles. A few orders even came from King William I of W√ºrttemberg.

Life and career Omu Okwei was born in 1872 to Igbo Prince Osuna Afubeho and one of his wives, a granddaughter of Abo king Obi Ossai. At the age of nine, her mother sent her to live among the Igala with one of her aunts. She learned basic business practices, and traded fruits, yams and poultry. When she was 15, following the death of her father, she lived with her mother at Atani, a city on the Niger River. In 1889, she married Joseph Allagoa, a trader from Brass. Her family disapproved of her choice and did not give her a dowry. The couple had a child, Joseph, and divorced the following year. She traversed the Niger River, selling clothing, pots, and lamps. She exchanged the merchandise for food which she then sold to Europeans. In 1895 she married Opene of Abo, whose mother was Okwenu Ezewene (1896‚Äì1904), another wealthy woman trader. Okwei had a second son, Peter. The British colonial government formalized male institutions while undermining those of the women. Officials issued warrants to men that gave them the authority to sit in Native courts. Okwei was one of few women who were offered a warrant and served in the Onitsha Native Court from 1912 until the 1930s. She was given the title of omu of the Osomari in August 1935. In the traditional dual-sex government, the omu was the apex leader of the congress of women leaders, overseeing women's affairs and settling disputes. She was elected Market Queen, Chairwoman of the Council of Mothers after amassing a fortune. She was the last merchant queen before the British replaced the Council of Mothers' traditional role supervising retailing. fer Okwei died in 1943 in Onitsha, Nigeria.

The aim of preoperative care is to do whatever is right to increase the success of the surgery. At some point before the operation the health care provider will assess the fitness of the person to have surgery. This assessment should include whatever tests are indicated, but not include screening for conditions without an indication. Immediately before surgery the person's body is prepared, perhaps by washing with an antiseptic, and whenever possible their anxiety is addressed to make them comfortable. Technique At some point before surgery a health care provider conducts a preoperative assessment to verify that a person is fit and ready for the surgery. For surgeries in which a person receives either general or local anesthesia, this assessment may be done either by a doctor or a nurse trained to do the assessment. The available research does not give insight about any differences in outcomes depending on whether a doctor or nurse conducts this assessment. =Addressing anxiety= Playing calming music to patients immediately before surgery has a beneficial effect in addressing anxiety about the surgery. =Surgical site preparation= Hair removal at the location where the surgical incision is made is often done before the surgery. Sufficient evidence does not exist to say that removing hair is a useful way to prevent infections. When it is done immediately before surgery, the use of hair clippers might be preferable to shaving. Bathing with an antiseptic like chlorhexidine does not seem to affect incidence of complications after surgery. However, washing the surgical site with chlorhexidine after surgery does seem helpful for preventing surgical site infection. Risks Screening is a test to see whether a person has a disease, and screenings are often done before surgery. Screenings should happen when they are indicated and not otherwise as a matter of routine. Screenings which are done without indication carry the risks of having unnecessary health care. Commonly overused screenings include the following: *Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are sometimes given before any kind of surgery as a matter of routine, but are unnecessary if a person does not have new and worrisome symptoms and if the surgery is minor. Eye surgery, for example, would not usually require an ECG. *Cardiac imaging and cardiac stress tests are usually unnecessary for people who do not have a serious heart condition and who are having surgery unrelated to the heart. People in the United States using government healthcare services are especially likely to have this procedure without indication. *Chest x-rays are usually unnecessary for people under age 70 who are not having chest surgery and who do not have worrisome symptoms. *Breathing tests are usually unnecessary for people who do not smoke, do not have respiratory disease, and who do not have symptoms. *Carotid ultrasonography is usually unnecessary for people who have not had a stroke or mini-stroke. Special populations =Children= Among children who are at normal risk for normal risk of pulmonary aspiration or vomiting during anaesthesia, there is no evidence showing that denying them oral liquids before surgery improves outcomes but there is evidence showing that giving liquids prevents anxiety. =Recreational substance users= Sometimes before a surgery a health care provider will recommend some health intervention to modify some risky behavior which is associated with complications from surgery. Smoking cessation before surgery is likely to reduce the risk of complications from surgery. In circumstances in which a person's doctor advises them to avoid drinking alcohol before and after the surgery, but in which the person seems likely to drink anyway, intense interventions which direct a person to quit using alcohol have been proven to be helpful in reducing complications from surgery.

It records the burial of Stephen, the beginnings of Christian persecution, and the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of Samaria and Ethiopia. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this book as well as the Gospel of Luke.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 40 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 50 (3rd century; extant verses 26‚Äì32) *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Bezae (c. 400) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450) *Codex Laudianus (c. 550) =Old Testament references= * : =New Testament references= * : (Stephen's Death) Locations This chapter mentions the following places: * Azotus * Caesarea * Ethiopia * Gaza * Jerusalem * Judea * Samaria Saul's approval of Stephen's death (8:1a) The writer of Acts introduces Saul, later the Apostle Paul, as an active witness of Stephen's death in Acts 7:58, and confirmed his approval in Acts 8:1a. Reuben Torrey, in his Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, suggests that this clause [i.e. verse 8:1a] \\"evidently belongs to the conclusion of the previous chapter\\".Treasury of Scripture Knowledge on Acts 8:1, accessed 8 December 2016 =Verse 1= :[a] And Saul was consenting to his death. :[b] On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. And they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. MEV. *\\"Death\\": from Greek: (anairesis) which can refer to \\"murder\\". The church scattered (8:1b‚Äì4) The narrative is focused around two geographical poles: Jerusalem, where the apostles stay (verses 1b, 14) and the 'countryside of Judea and Samaria' where the rest of the church is 'scattered throughout (verse 1b), with unnamed disciples continuing the apostles' task to preach the gospel (verse 4), as the church history moves on to the middle stage of the apostolic commission in Acts 1:8 The story of church's expansion is interwoven with the record of Stephen's burial (verse 2) and the hint of Saul (later \\"Paul the apostle\\") future as a zealous instigator of the persecution, indicating that the community most affected by the wave of persecution to follow was the one to which both Stephen and Saul belonged, the 'synagogues of diaspora origin' (), because by the time of a group of 'disciples' is still in Jerusalem alongside the apostles. =Verse 4= :Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word. MEV While the apostles remain in Jerusalem, 'unnamed disciples exploit their scattered condition to spread the gospel'. Philip's mission in Samaria (8:5‚Äì13) The story of Philip's preaching serves as an example of 'a highly successful work of evangelism, accompanied by miraculous healings which impress the population' (verses 6, 8). The work brings about wonders, 'belief and baptism, i.e. intellectual conviction and entry into a new community', which even impresses a competitor, Simon (Magus) (verse 13), who used to 'bewitch' the Samaritans with sorceries (verses 9,10). =Verse 5= :Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. KJV *\\"Philip\\": is one of the \\"Seven\\" (Acts 6:5), not an apostle, and in Acts 21:8, he is characterized as 'the evangelist', settled in Caesarea with four daughters. The connection with a 'we-passage' in Acts 21 suggests the interaction with Philip as a source (directly or indirectly) of this story. *\\"Samaria\\": could refer to the region (as in RSV) or the name of its capital city (as in NRSV), which was rebuilt under Herod the Great. The coming of the Spirit in Samaria (8:14‚Äì25) This section highlights 'two related issues of church order': # The role of the apostles: in a supervisory role to keep an eye on new developments and to perform 'apostolic visitation' (verse 14). # Baptism and the Spirit: The event sequence seems to imply that 'baptism in the name of Jesus' (verse 12, 16) and the reception of the Spirit (verse 15) were 'two distinct events for the Samaritans' and that the Spirit could only come with the laying on of hands by the apostles (verse 17), but this should not be treated as a universal formula, because elsewhere in the book, the Spirit comes before baptism (e.g. 10:44‚Äì48), or is not recorded at all (e.g. 8:38). =Verse 16= :For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. NKJV *\\"Fallen\\": from Greek: , ',Hebrew Text Analysis: Acts 8:16.

R., Expositor's Greek Testament. Acts 8. Accessed 24 April 2019. Philip and the Ethiopian (8:26‚Äì40) Philip's another significant evangelistic task is to meet an Ethiopian on the way to Gaza (to go back to Ethiopia), following the divine guidance, both angel and (verse 26) and Spirit (verse 29, 39). In this part, Luke shows the exact geography of Philip's route: due south from Samaria intersects at Eleutheropolis with the Jerusalem‚ÄìGaza road (verse 26: epi means \\"down to\\" or \\"to meet\\"), and the miraculous timing of the journey: just at that moment kai idou, \\"and behold\\", verse 27), Philip's path crosses the route of the Ethiopian pilgrim, heading west to strike the coast road towards Egypt. =Verse 37 = : Then Philip said, ‚ÄúIf you believe with all your heart, you may.‚Äù :: And he answered and said, ‚ÄúI believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.‚Äù NKJV This verse is absent from the majority of the Greek manuscripts, but it is present in some, including E (6th or 7th century). It is cited by Irenaeus (c. 180) Citation on this verse by Irenaeus (c. AD 180): \\"[Philip declared] that this was Jesus, and that the Scripture was fulfilled in Him; as did also the believing eunuch himself: and, immediately requesting to be baptized, he said, \\"I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.\\" This man was also sent into the regions of Ethiopia, to preach what he had himself believed, that there was one God preached by the prophets, but that the Son of this [God] had already made [His] appearance in human nature (secundum hominem)\\" (Irenaeus (AD 140‚Äì200). Against Heresies. Book III). and by Cyprian (c. 250),Citation by Cyprian: \\"For although in the Acts of the Apostles the eunuch is described as at once baptized by Philip, because \\"he believed with his whole heart,\\" this is not a fair parallel. For he was a Jew, and as he came from the temple of the Lord he was reading the prophet Isaiah,\\" (Cyprian (200‚Äì258). The Life and Passion of Cyprian, Bishop and Martyr. paragraph 3) and is found in the Old Latin (2nd/3rd century) and the Vulgate (380‚Äì400) translations. In his notes Erasmus says that he took this reading from the margin of 4ap and incorporated it into the Textus Receptus.Edward F. Hills (1912‚Äì1981), \\"The King James Version Defended: A Christian View of the New Testament Manuscripts\\" (1956). Chapter 8, The Christian Research Press; 4th edition (August 1997) J. A. Alexander (1857) suggested that this verse, though genuine, was omitted by many scribes, \\"as unfriendly to the practice of delaying baptism, which had become common, if not prevalent, before the end of the 3rd century.\\"The Acts Of The Apostles, by J.
