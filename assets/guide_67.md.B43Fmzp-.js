L. Sherred, first published in 1947, about the consequences of a time viewer, a machine that projects images of the past. It has been reprinted many times, including in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame. Publication The story was Sherred's first science fiction publication. According to Algis Budrys, it was contrary to the spirit of Astounding Science Fiction, where it appeared, and it \\"dismissed\\" the \\"bourgeois aspirations\\" of ASF's editor, John W. Campbell. A review that first appeared in the June 1970 Galaxy Science Fiction of Sherred's novel, Alien Island. It is said that the story was accepted in Campbell's absence and that it was \\"shoehorned\\" into the magazine by L. Jerome Stanton, who for a short time acted \\"heretically\\" as Campbell's assistant. Synopsis Taking place at some time in the near future (relative to when it was written), the story is briefly framed as a manuscript written by a civilian and delivered to the military under circumstances of great tension. The manuscript is a long letter to \\"Joe\\", an otherwise unknown character, by Ed Lefko, one of the two lead characters. He describes seeing a silent but color movie aimed at Mexican-Americans in a run-down theater in Detroit. The movie depicts Cortés's conquest of Mexico with remarkably realistic sets and acting and a huge cast. The projectionist, a World War II veteran named Miguel \\"Mike\\" Laviada, tells Ed that he made the movie using a time viewer he invented, which he demonstrates. However, Mike has not been able to raise the capital needed to shoot the picture on high-quality film, add sound and other improvements, and get it distributed and advertised. He and Ed become partners, and at Ed's suggestion, they raise money by using the machine to blackmail wealthy people. They spend a year making most of a new film out of time-viewed footage of Alexander the Great. They take it to Hollywood, where the high quality of the film easily convinces a producer and his associates to finish it, including using actors for scenes that appear in Alexander's biographies but did not really happen, and market it. The film is a great success with critics and viewers. Mike and Ed produce a film on the Roman Empire, then one on the French Revolution. Both are successful, but the second arouses some controversy because of differences from widely believed myths. Through Mike's influence, Ed becomes less greedy and joins Mike in his plan to use the films against war. The next film, on the American Revolution, and the next, on the American Civil War, are banned in many places but still earn huge amounts of money. The next film is about the First and Second World Wars. Ed and Mike admit the machine's existence to their associates and persuade them to join in their plan to expose the corruption of many famous people involved in the wars. The film causes riots in many countries and greatly increases international hostility. Ed, Mike, and their associates are arrested for incitement to riot and other crimes. In their trial, they demonstrate the machine by showing the judge where he was on a certain day. They are acquitted, but the United States Army secretly takes them into \\"protective custody\\" and confiscates the machine. Mike and Ed's plan was to make war impossible by disseminating plans for the machine so every government and military could be watched. However, as the U.S. Army has the only machine, Ed expects other powers will attack preemptively before America can use its decisive advantage. He pleads with Joe to retrieve letters containing plans for the machine from their safe-deposit box—he has left Joe a key—and send them to their addressees around the world. The story ends with military dispatches showing that Ed and Mike are dead, the bank and its contents have been destroyed by a direct hit with a nuclear weapon, and Washington, D. C. has been attacked with nuclear weapons. The last dispatch refers to a \\"necessary and obvious cessation of hostilities\\". Characters Edward Joseph Lefkowicz, known as Ed Lefko. A worldly-wise opportunist with a love for gadgets. Initially unscrupulous, he becomes more idealistic as a result of his contact with Mike. Miguel Jose Zapata Laviada, known as Mike. The son of Mexican immigrants. An Army radar technician during World War II, he invented the time viewer and wants to use it to end war. He and Ed share a fondness for beer. Ruth: An attractive, fun-loving young blonde, she becomes the secretary of Ed and Mike's company (with little to do for a long time), and their companion for drinking and dancing. They talk her into going to Los Angeles with them; there she becomes an actress in B movies. Edward Lee Johnson, known as Lee Johnson: The Hollywood figure in charge of the production company that finishes Ed's and Mike's films.

Mercedes Maria Gomez: A teacher of deaf children who reads lips in Spanish to provide dialogue for the film on the world wars, and testifies at the trial as part of the defense's case that the film is factual. Reception Many people have called \\"E for Effort\\" classic, though some have limited the description to \\"a minor classic\\". Fletcher Pratt cited it as an example of \\"a brilliantly original concept\\" with \\"no story at all... the science is dandy, but there is no fiction\\", so a reader would not reread it and would give it no more than a qualified recommendation. Algis Budrys called it \\"a coherent, logical, entertaining, believable\\" story. He said it was the first to disturb \\"the National Guard armory that science fiction had become\\", as it involved a struggle \\"between Man and the Establishment\\", showed a man of Mexican ancestry as a brilliant and idealistic engineer rather than an exotic villain, and saw something better for engineers than a safe, lucrative career. Jerry Pournelle said in 1985 that it was the only important story in modern science fiction, outside the work of Jack Williamson, that had \\"an easy, sophisticated view of international and corporate realpolitik\\" reminiscent of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. Brian Stableford called it \\"perhaps the most perfect ironic fantasy\\" on the theme that the privileged will not permit new technology to undermine their privilege. James Gunn noted that Isaac Asimov's short story \\"The Dead Past\\" (1956) returns to the concept of \\"E for Effort\\".

It is owned and maintained by Nottingham City Council. It located alongside University Boulevard, adjoining the University of Nottingham's University Park campus. Due to its proximity to the university campus to the north, Highfields Park appears to be a part of the campus itself and therefore many refer to the whole area as University Park. There are historical ties between the park and the campus. The park contains a boating lake, complete with boats to hire throughout the summer months. The cascade and the stepping stones at the western end are Grade II listed. To the south of the lake the Tottle Brook, a tributary of the River Trent, flows on the surface, this brook is culverted for much of its length. At the eastern end there are children's play facilities and a pavilion with a cafe. History The fish pond, with the University of Nottingham's Trent Building overlooking it The site, originally part of the Highfields Estate, belonged to Joseph Lowe who along with his son Alfred, developed the site in the late 18th century and were responsible for much of the landscaping that is visible today. In 1789 Joseph Lowe constructed 'Highfields House' which was to be used as his residence. Lowe improved the estate with the creation of a fish pond from the existing Tottle Brook. The Lowes retained ownership up until 1920 when the land was purchased by Sir Jesse Boot (also known as Lord Trent) the founder of the Boot's the Chemist. His intention was to emulate Cadburys at Bournville and the levers at Port Sunlight and build high quality homes for his worker in the near adjacent purpose built factories. The company was bought out by the American, Louis K. Liggett of the United Drug Company. Liggett had no interest in model housing. Jesse Boot was cash rich and owned 121 acres of land which he proceeded to disperse to good causes. Boot used 35 acres of the estate to form the core of East Midlands University. He built a raised road to connect Nottingham to Beeston, and landscaped the area south of the Trent building given as a park for Nottingham City Council. The remains of the estate, also called Highfields park, the other side of University Boulevard, was given over to sport fields. Also on the land he built a very large Lido, which, in 1922 was the largest in England. The fishpond created by Joseph Lowe was enhanced and upgraded to a boating lake that still exists today, the spoil from this extensive excavation was used to raise the land level for the road. Until flood prevention measures became effective in the 1950s the River Trent had regularly flooded this part of its floodplain after heavy rain. The park was constructed between 1922 and 1926. Boot opened the park in stages so there was no formal opening. He gave the deeds to the land to Nottingham City Council in 1925, but retained the right to manage it for his lifetime. Boot died in 1931; Nottingham City Council formally adopted the park in 1932. The ornamental park was designed by Percy Richard Morley Horder who designed it in the Victorian municipal manner with areas of planting such as an azalea walk, areas for open air dancing (which was soon change to croquet) and crown green bowling. It had a paddling pool for children and boat trips, and rowing skiffs for hire on the lake. The road cost £200,000 to construct. The northern part of the land was prepared for the East Midland's first University which was a project largely funded by Sir Jesse Boot himself. This contained Highfields House, which became part the new university campus. The centre piece of the campus is the Trent Building with its tower. This provided a visual focus for the park too, the building, and its formal lawns share a visual axis with the lakeside terraces, and the formal main gate. To this vista,there have been added two monumental Chinese stone lions, gifted from City of Ningbo, China. A stone lion with ball in its mouth and playful cubs, A gift from the City of Ningbo, China. In the early 21st century the park was underfunded and neglected and the features fell into disuse. To attempt to save the park Nottingham City Council applied for £4 million funding from the National Lottery to de-silt the lake, and repair the Maid Marian pleasure boat so it could be reintroduced onto the lake. They applied to refurbish the site's historic pavilions, bridges and lighting columns and develop a new water park and adventure golf course. The National Lottery 'Parks for People Fund' have confirmed a Stage 2 pass for the £3,240,500 needed for the project in January 2015. Works are expected to take place on site in 2016. Features Natural sandstone outcrop The park was designed in the valley of the Tottle Brook at the foot of a natural sandstone outcrop. The Tottle brook is used to source an ornamental boating lake; a new channel was dug for the brook to the south of the lake, leading from a culvert in the west to a culvert in the east. The boating lake features an island reached by ornamental bridges, to the west there is a cascade. In front of the cascade, the lake is crossed by a long run of stepping stones. A weir separated this part of the park from the boating. The lake is populated by ornamental carp. The stepping stones To the east, is a lake side terrace and the D.H.Lawrence pavilion with the normal children's play equipment nearby. In the sandstone outcrop there are caves. When the park was remodelled in 1921, formal gates were constructed to the south of the lake creating a visual axis to the neighbouring Trent building on the escarpment in University Park. The gates are grand, with sentinel eagle sculptures on the piers. An ornamental bridge spans the brook, and steps lead from the lake side terrace to the lake. Here one finds two Chinese stone lion sculptures presented to Nottingham by the city of Ningbo. To the south of the lake was extensive planting including the azalea collection and many trees that are suitable for climbing. These have been neglected and plans have been made, and are now funded, for restoration. thumb On the exterior there was a circular paddling pool, croquet lawns and bowling greens. The paddling pool, has gone (November 2015), but the bowlings greens are in use as three croquet lawns complementing the five original croquet lawns. The azalea walk is to be re- established (November 2015) through the Lottery Fund grant. The Maid Marion motor launch was restored in 2000, but is off the lake until more silt has been removed. =Wildlife= Egyptian goose(m) in Highfields Park 2016. On the lake there are rails such as moorhen and coots and ducks such as tufted ducks and mallards. There are Canada geese and a pair of feral Egyptian geese who in February 2016 hatched four goslings. The lake was used by Severn Trent Water as a fish hatchery, so angling was not permitted. =Highfields lakeside pavilion= The original Lake pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1999, and couldn't be saved. It was replaced by the D H Lawrence pavilion in 2001. It contains a theatre, gallery and café. It is leased to the university. =Maid Marion= A wooden motor launch that took and will take visitors round the lake once the lake has been de-silted. =Highfields Paddling Pool= The former Highfields paddling pool in 2008 after rain. The iconic round paddling pool will not be restored, it has been closed since before 1986 for reasons of hygiene. Local wags suggested that letting children play in the lake for 20 minutes would inoculate them against all known diseases =Highfields Lido= The Highfields Lido (1922-1981) was the first to open in Nottingham, before Bulwell and Claverley. It was the largest lido in the country, the pool was , holding of water. It was fed by a pipe from the boating lake and discharged into the Tottle Brook. It was drained and refilled once a week, on a Sunday when it was closed to the public. Nottingham City Council took control in 1932 and installed a filtration and circulation plant. Between 1932 and 1951 attempts were made to heat the water but this was not successful. It closed in 1981 and was demolished. The site was obtained by the university and is now a concert hall and offices. The lido was designed by Percy Richard Morley Horder who drew on the Roman style of architecture. He used red brick walling and pantile roofing and incorporated archways in front of the changing cubicles to break up the line of the buildings. Though it had a massive surface of water, it was short of terrace space for relaxing. In the late 1930s a sun-deck was built that spanned the basin, this caused problems with the filtration, and it was removed in the 1950s. In 1963 after 17 years of debate, was bought to extend the terrace and provide a paddling pool. This was built at southern end.

He attended school in Klæbu and graduated in 1843. After graduation, Vig worked as a private tutor for the family of a parish priest in Åfjord (1843-1845). He subsequently held a teaching position in Kristiansund. From 1851-1857, he served as editor of the magazine Folkevennen, which was published between the years 1852-1900 by the Norwegian literary society, Selskabet for folkeoplysningens fremme. He also published the poetry collection Norske Bondeblomster in 1851, and the history book Norges historie indtil Harald Haarfagre in 1857. His poem and national hymn (Blandt alle Lande) was published in Salmer og Sange til Brug ved Skolelærer-Møde from 1854. Vig suffered from the effects of tuberculosis. He died at age 34 just before Christmas 1857. He was buried Christmas Eve at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Oslo. Ole Vig-prisen Since 1979, the Ole Vig Prize (Ole Vig-prisen) has been awarded annually to the Norwegian youth between the ages of 20 and 35 years who has made an outstandingly cultural effort in the spirit of Ole Vig.

The conscription began in May 1941. All of the twenty classes were drawn from male minority populations and included the elderly and mentally ill. They were given no weapons but were gathered in labour battalions who were employed in the construction of roads.. They were allegedly forced to work under very bad conditions. The prevailing and widespread point of view on the matter was that, anticipating entry to World War II, Turkey gathered in advance all unreliable non-Turkish men regarded as a potential \\"fifth column\\" if Germany attacked Turkey, after it had also invaded its neighbors Greece and Bulgaria. In July 1942 the men were released from their duty. One of the main intentions of the Turkish government was to seize the assets of the minority population. The conscripted minorities were bankrupted since they could not manage their businesses during the incident of the Twenty Classes and as a result they had to sell their companies and assets for nearly nothing.

Biography Goto was born on January 26, 1931 in Shibuya, Tokyo. After attending Seikei High School he went to Tokyo University, where he graduated in 1953. He continued his graduate studies at Tokyo in physics under the supervision of Hidetosi Takahasi, earning his doctorate in 1962. He became a faculty member at Tokyo in 1959.. In 1968, he became the chief scientist of the Information Science Laboratory at RIKEN, a position he held until 1991.. However, he continued to hold a position at Tokyo University as well, becoming a full professor there in 1970. He retired from the University of Tokyo in 1990, and in 1991 he moved to Kanagawa University. Goto was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961. He was vice president of the International Federation for Information Processing from 1971 to 1974, and also served several times on the steering committee of the Information Processing Society of Japan. Goto died on June 12, 2005, of complications of diabetes. Research In 1954 while he was still a graduate student, Goto invented the parametron, a circuit element that combined a ferrite core with a capacitor to generate electrical oscillations whose timing could be controlled.. This provided an alternative to the vacuum tube technology then in use for building computing devices. He completed the construction of the PC-1, one of the first general-purpose computers built in Japan, in 1958, using parametron-based logic.. Soon afterwards, he proposed the Goto pair, a device related to the parametron. Parametrons continued to be used for computing in Japan until the 1960s when they gave way to transistors. The quantum flux parametron is a later improvement of the parametron, also by Goto, that uses superconducting Josephson junctions to improve both the speed and the energy consumption of these devices. During his visit to MIT in 1961, Goto devised the first time- optimal solution to the firing squad synchronization problem, a problem of designing a cellular automaton in which all cells simultaneously fire, starting from an initial configuration with only one active cell.. In electron beam lithography, Goto's work included the development of double deflection tubes and variable shaping techniques. In the early 1970s, Goto's work on electron beam lithography led him to become interested in the ability of symbolic algebra systems to manipulate mathematical formulae. In order to implement these systems, Goto developed a new Lisp system called HLISP, in which he had introduced the innovative technique of hash consing to eliminate redundant memory usage by using a hash table to map duplicated values to the same position in memory. Goto's work in symbolic computing also included the development of FLATS, a specialized computer hardware system aimed at this problem. Other topics in Goto's research included the search for magnetic monopoles and fractional electrical charges, computer graphics, memory devices based on cathode ray tubes, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and the automated analysis of bubble chamber experiments. Awards and honors Goto was one of the winners of the Asahi Prize in 1959 for his work on the parametron and the PC-1.The Asahi Prize, retrieved 2011-09-05. He won the in 1988, and in 1989 he was given the Purple Ribbon Medal of Honor by the Japanese government for his work on electron beam shaping.Author biography from .

Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transportation, aeroplane or helicopter, to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations aboard helicopter and propeller aircraft or jet aircraft. The use of air transport to provide medical evacuation on the battlefield dates to World War I, but its role was expanded dramatically during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Later on, aircraft began to be used for the civilian emergency medical services. Helicopters can bring specialist care to the scene and transport patients to specialist hospitals, especially for major trauma cases. Fixed-wing aircraft are used for long- distance transport. In some remote areas, air medical services deliver non- emergency healthcare such as general practitioner appointments. An example of this is the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, who also provide emergency care. Advantages Air medical services can travel faster and operate in a wider coverage area than a land ambulance. This makes them particularly useful in sparsely-populated rural areas. Air medical services have a particular advantage for major trauma injuries. The controversial theory of the golden hour suggests that major trauma patients should be transported as quickly as possible to a specialist trauma center. Therefore, medical responders in a helicopter can provide both a higher level of care at the scene of a trauma and faster transport to a trauma center. They can also provide critical care when transporting patients from community hospitals to trauma centers. Indications for air transport Effective use of helicopter services for trauma depends on the ground responder's ability to determine whether the patient's condition warrants air medical transport. Protocols and training must be developed to ensure appropriate triage criteria are applied. Excessively stringent criteria can prevent rapid care and transport of trauma victims; relaxed criteria can result in the patient being unnecessarily exposed to the potential dangers of dangerous weather conditions or other aviation-related risks. Crew and patient safety is the single most important factor to be considered when deciding whether to transport a patient by helicopter. Weather, air traffic patterns, and distances (such as from the trauma scene to closest level 1 trauma centre) must also be considered. Another reason for cancelling a flight is based on the comfort of the flight crew with the flight. The general rule of safety is upon the crew, when there is one pilot and two medical crew is: > \\"3 to go, 1 to say 'NO'\\". If one flight member is not comfortable with the > flight for whatever reason, the flight is cancelled. Some have questioned the safety of air medical services.Meier, B, Saul, S. Fatal crashes provoke debate on safety of sky ambulances. New York Times, February 28, 2005.Levin, A, Davis, R. Surge in crashes scars air ambulance industry. USA Today, July 18, 2005. While the number of crashes may be increasing, the number of programs and use of services has also increased. Factors associated with fatal crashes of medical transport helicopters include flying at night and during bad weather, and postcrash fires. Air ambulance A Eurocopter EC 145 of Switzerland's Rega air rescue service An air ambulance is a specially outfitted helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft that transports injured or sick people in a medical emergency or over distances or terrain impractical for a conventional ground ambulance. Fixed-wing aircraft are also more often used to move patients over long distances and for repatriation from foreign countries. These and related operations are called aeromedical. In some circumstances, the same aircraft may be used to search for missing or wanted people. Like ground ambulances, air ambulances are equipped with medical equipment vital to monitoring and treating injured or ill patients. Common equipment for air ambulances includes medications, ventilators, ECGs and monitoring units, CPR equipment, and stretchers. A medically staffed and equipped air ambulance provides medical care in flight—while a non-medically equipped and staffed aircraft simply transports patients without care in flight. Military organizations and NATO refer to the former as medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and to the latter as casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). Air Traffic Control (ATC) grants special treatment to air ambulance operations, much like a ground ambulance using lights and a siren, only when they are actively operating with a patient. When this happens, air ambulance aircraft take the call sign MEDEVAC (formerly LIFEGUARD) and receive priority handling in the air and on the ground. =History= Military As with many Emergency Medical Service (EMS) innovations, treating patients in flight originated in the military. The concept of using aircraft as ambulances is almost as old as powered flight itself. Although balloons were not used to evacuate wounded soldiers at the Siege of Paris in 1870,Lam DM. \\"To Pop A Balloon: Air Evacuation During The Siege of Paris, 1870.\\" Aviation, Space, & Environmental Medicine, 59(10): 988-991, October 1988. air evacuation was experimented with during the First World War. The first recorded British ambulance flight took place in 1917 in Turkey when a soldier in the Camel Corps who had been shot in the ankle was flown to hospital in a de Havilland DH9 in 45 minutes. First Recorded Aeromedical Evacuation in the British Army The same journey by land would have taken some 3 days to complete. In the 1920s several services, both official and unofficial, started up in various parts of the world. Aircraft were still primitive at the time, with limited capabilities, and the effort received mixed reviews. Ambulance Junkers Ju 52, Balkans, 1941 Exploration of the idea continued, however, and France and the United Kingdom used fully organized air ambulance services during the African and Middle Eastern Colonial Wars of the 1920s. In 1920, the British, while suppressing the \\"Mad Mullah\\" in Somaliland, used an Airco DH.9A fitted out as an air ambulance. It carried a single stretcher under a fairing behind the pilot.Flight, 13 April 1956, p. 424. The French evacuated over 7,000 casualties during that period.\\"Lam, DM. Wings of Life and Hope: A History of Aeromedical Evacuation.\\" Problems in Critical Care, 4(4): 477-494, December 1990. By 1936, an organized military air ambulance service evacuated wounded from the Spanish Civil War for medical treatment in Nazi Germany; this service continued during the Second World War. American casualty evacuated by helicopter, Korean War, 1951 The first use of medevac with helicopters was the evacuation of three British pilot combat casualties by a US Army Sikorsky in Burma during WW2, and the first dedicated use of helicopters by U.S. forces occurred during the Korean War, between 1950 and 1953. The French used light helicopters in the First Indochina War. While popularly depicted as simply removing casualties from the battlefield (which they did), helicopters in the Korean War also moved critical patients to hospital ships after initial emergency treatment in field hospitals. Knowledge and expertise of use of air ambulances evolved parallel to the aircraft themselves. By 1969, in Vietnam, the use of specially trained medical corpsmen and helicopter air ambulances led U.S. researchers to determine that servicemen wounded in battle had better rates of survival than motorists injured on California freeways. This inspired the first experiments with the use of civilian paramedics in the world.\\"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society.\\" National Academy of Sciences (White Paper), 1966. The US military recently employed UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to provide air ambulance service during the Iraq War to military personnel and civilians.Bearl, Spc.

The use of military aircraft as battlefield ambulances continues to grow and develop today in a variety of countries, as does the use of fixed-wing aircraft for long-distance travel, including repatriation of the wounded. Currently, a NATO working group is investigating unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) for casualty evacuation.

In northern Canada, Australia, and in Scandinavian countries, remote, sparsely populated settlements are often inaccessible by road for months at a time, or even year-round. In some places in Scandinavia, particularly in Norway, the primary means of transportation between communities is by boat. Early in aviation history, many of these communities began to rely on civilian \\"bush\\" pilots, who fly small aircraft and transport supplies, mail, and visiting doctors or nurses. Bush pilots probably performed the first civilian air ambulance trips, albeit on an ad hoc basis—but clearly, a need for these services existed. In the early 1920s, Sweden established a standing air ambulance system, as did Siam (Thailand). In 1928 the first formal, full-time air ambulance service was established in the Australian outback. This organization became the Royal Flying Doctor Service\\"Royal Flying Doctor Service.\\" flyingdoctor.net. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. and still operates.

The Saskatchewan government had to consider remote communities and great distances in providing health care to its citizens.\\"Saskatchewan Air Ambulance.\\" Government of Saskatchewan.

Schaefer Air Service was also the first FAA- certified air ambulance service in the United States. When the Saskatchewan and Schaefer services began, paramedicine was still decades away, and unless a physician or nurse accompanied the patient, air ambulances primarily provided medical transportation. A great deal of the early use of aircraft as ambulances in civilian life, particularly helicopters, involved the improvised use of aircraft that belonged to the military. Eventually, this became more organized. This occurred not only in the United States, but also in other countries, and persists today. Today in the U.S., helicopters and airplanes carry out approximately a half-million transports per year.

Project CARESOM was established in Mississippi in 1969. Three helicopters were purchased through a federal grant and located strategically in the north, central, and southern areas of the state.\\"Our History: Forrest General Hospital.\\" forrestgeneral.com. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. Upon termination of the grant, the program was considered a success and each of the three communities were given the opportunity to continue the helicopter operation. Only the one located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi did so, and it was therefore established as the first civilian air medical program in the United States. The second program, the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) system, was established in Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio in 1969. This was an experiment by the Department of Transportation to study the feasibility of using military helicopters to augment existing civilian emergency medical services. These programs were highly successful at establishing the need for such services. The remaining challenge was in how such services could be operated most cost- effectively. In many cases, as agencies, branches, and departments of the civilian governments began to operate aircraft for other purposes, these aircraft were frequently pressed into service to provide cost-effective air support to the evolving Emergency Medical Services. Image:GFS Super Puma on USS Mobile Bay.jpgHong Kong's Government Flying Service Image:RettungshubschrauberChristoph13 EC135-1.jpgGerman 'Christoph' Air Ambulance of the Federal Ministry of the Interior As the concept was proven, dedicated civilian air ambulances began to appear.

Retrieved: December 4, 2010. The apparent success of Christoph 1 led to a quick expansion of the concept across Germany, with Christoph 10 entering service in 1975, Christoph 20 in 1981, and Christoph 51 in 1989. As of 2007, there are about 80 helicopters named after Saint Christopher, like Christoph Europa 5 (also serving Denmark), Christoph Brandenburg or Christoph Murnau am Staffelsee. Austria adopted the German system in 1983 when Christophorus 1 entered service at Innsbruck. The first civilian, hospital- based medical helicopter program in the United States began operation in 1972.\\"First in the Nation - Celebrating 37 Years of Air Medical Transport!\\" Flight for Life, 2006. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. Flight For Life Colorado began with a single Alouette III helicopter, based at St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver, Colorado. In Ontario, Canada, the air ambulance program began in 1977, and featured a paramedic-based system of care, with the presence of physicians or nurses being relatively unusual. The system, operated by the Ontario Ministry of Health, began with a single rotor-wing aircraft based in Toronto. An important difference in the Ontario program involved the emphasis of service. \\"On scene\\" calls were taken, although less commonly, and a great deal of the initial emphasis of the program was on the interfacility transfer of critical care patients. Operating today through a private contractor (ORNGE), the system operates 33 aircraft stationed at 26 bases across the province, performing both interfacility transfers and on- scene responses in support of ground-based EMS. Today, across the world, the presence of civilian air ambulances has become commonplace and is seen as a much-needed support for ground-based EMS systems. In other countries of Europe, like SFR Yugoslavia, first air ambulance appeared in the 1980s. The most of the fleet was previously used in military service. With the increased number of car accidents in 1979 on highways, the Yugoslavian government made a decision to buy new or redistribution of use of old helicopters.Air ambulance and rescue in Yugoslavia Retrieved: Mart 2015 File:London's Air Ambulance Helicopter at Tower Bridge.jpgLondon's Air Ambulance - London, England File:STAR2B.jpegSTARS - Alberta, Canada File:Agusta 109 samu.JPGSAMU - France File:Helikopter van het Mobiel Medisch Team.jpgMobiel Medisch Team - Netherlands File:Svensk flybambulans79.jpgSwedish King Air File:Hartford Hosptial LifeStar.JPGHartford Hospital's LifeStar - Connecticut, USA File:AirLife 4000.jpgAn air ambulance helicopter, taken in Urbana, IL File:HALO 2 and 3.jpgHALO 2 and 3 delivering critical care services in central South Africa.

There are a number of reasonable methods of differentiating types of air ambulance services. These include military/civilian models and services that are government-funded, fee- for-service, donated by a business enterprise, or funded by public donations. It may also be reasonable to differentiate between dedicated aircraft and those with multiple purposes and roles. Finally, it is reasonable to differentiate by the type of aircraft used, including rotary-wing, fixed-wing, or very large aircraft. The military role in civilian air ambulance operations is described in the History section. Each of the remaining models is explored separately. This information applies to air ambulance systems performing emergency service. In almost all jurisdictions, private aircraft charter companies provide non-emergency air ambulance service on a fee-for-service basis. Government operated Scottish Ambulance Service - The UK's only Government funded air ambulance service. In some cases, governments provide air ambulance services, either directly or via a negotiated contract with a commercial service provider, such as an aircraft charter company. Such services may focus on critical care patient transport, support ground-based EMS on scenes, or may perform a combination of these roles. In almost all cases, the government provides guidelines to hospitals and EMS systems to control operating costs—and may specify operating procedures in some level of detail to limit potential liability. However, the government almost always takes a 'hands-off' approach to the actual running of the system, relying instead on local managers with subject matter (physicians and aviation executives) expertise. Ontario's ORNGE program and the Polish Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (LPR) are examples of this type of operating system.\\"History.\\" ornge.ca. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. The Polish LPR is a national system covering the entire country and funded by the government through the Ministry of Health but run independently, there is no independent HEMS operator in Poland. In North East Ohio, including Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County-owned MetroHealth Medical Center uses its Metro Life Flight to transport patients to Metro's level I trauma and burn unit. There are 5 helicopters for North East Ohio and, in addition, Metro Life Flight has one fixed-wing aircraft.\\"Metro Life Flight.\\" The MetroHealth System. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. In the United Kingdom, the Scottish Ambulance Service operates two helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft twenty-four hours per day. These represent the UK's only government-funded air ambulance service. Multiple purpose Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service in Australia In some jurisdictions, cost is a major consideration, and the presence of dedicated air ambulances is simply not practical. In these cases, the aircraft may be operated by another government or quasi-government agency and made available to EMS for air ambulance service when required. In southern New South Wales, Australia, the helicopter that responds as an air ambulance is actually operated by the local hydroelectric utility, with the New South Wales Ambulance Service providing paramedics, as required. In some cases, local EMS provides the flight paramedic to the aircraft operator as-needed. In the case of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the helicopters are brush fire choppers also configured as air ambulances with a paramedic provided from whichever fire department rescue unit has responded. Sometimes the air ambulance may be run as a dual concern with another governmental body - for example, the Wiltshire Air Ambulance was run as a joint Ambulance Service and police unit until 2014. In other cases, the paramedic staffs the aircraft full-time, but has a dual function. In the case of the Maryland State Police, for example, the flight paramedic is a serving State Trooper whose job is to act as the Observer Officer on a police helicopter when not required for medical emergencies.\\"Governor O'Malley Announces New Additions to Maryland's World-Class Emergency Response.\\" Maryland State Police Aviation Command via mspaviation.org, October 20, 2010. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. Fee-for- service Switzerland REGA Fee-for-service In many cases, local jurisdictions do not charge for air ambulance service, particularly for emergency calls. However, the cost of providing air ambulance services is considerable and many, including government-run operations, charge for service. Organizations such as service aircraft charter companies, hospitals, and some private-for-profit EMS systems generally charge for service. Within the European Union, almost all air ambulance service is on a fee-for-service basis, except for systems that operate by private subscription. Many jurisdictions have a mix of operation types. Fee-for-service operators are generally responsible for their own organization but may have to meet government licensing requirements. Rega of Switzerland is an example of such a service.\\"Rega Switzerland.\\" rega.ch/en. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. Donated by business German Auto Club In some cases, a local business or even a multi-national company may choose to fund local air ambulance service as a goodwill or public relations gesture. Examples of this are common in the European Union, where in London the Virgin Corporation previously donated to the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, and in Germany and the Netherlands a large number of the 'Christoph' air ambulance operations are actually funded by ADAC, Germany's largest automobile club\\"ADAC.\\" adac.de. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. and DRF Luftrettung. In Australia and New Zealand, many air ambulance helicopter operations are sponsored by the Westpac Bank. In these cases, the operation may vary but is the result of a carefully negotiated agreement between government, EMS, hospitals, and the donor. In most cases, while the sponsor receives advertising exposure in exchange for funding, they take a 'hands-off' approach to daily operations, relying instead on subject matter specialists. Public donations supported Public donations In some cases, air ambulance services may be provided by means of voluntary charitable fundraising, as opposed to government funding, or they may receive limited government subsidy to supplement local donations. Some countries, such as the U.K., use a mix of such systems. In Scotland, the parliament has voted to fund air ambulance service directly, through the Scottish Ambulance Service. In England and Wales, however, the service is funded on a charitable basis via a number of local charities for each region covered. Great strides have been made in the UK, with the 'Association of Air Ambulance (AAA)'. This organization is widely credited for having created the political climate that made the helicopter industry and National Health Service recognise the enormous contribution charities make to trauma care in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the AAA published the \\"Framework for a High Performing Air Ambulance Service\\" which details many of the developments from 2008 to 2013. In recent years, the service has moved towards the physician- paramedic model of care. This has necessitated some charities commissioning clinical governance services, however many air ambulances operate under the tasking ambulances services clinical governance. The AAA now publishes Best Practice Guidance on a range of operational and clinical functions and provides a code of conduct that all full members, both ambulance services and charities must uphold. \\"Heavy-Lift\\" A final area of distinction is the operation of large, generally fixed-wing air ambulances. In the past, the infrequency of civilian demand for such a service confined such operations to the military, which requires them to support overseas combat operations.

Each operates aircraft staffed by physicians, nurses, and corpsmen/technicians, and each can provide long- distance transport with full medical support to dozens of patients simultaneously. However, in recent years, exceptions to the \\"military-only\\" rule have grown with the need to quickly transport patients to facilities that provide higher levels of care or to repatriate individuals. Air medical companies use both large and small fixed-wing aircraft configured to provide levels of care that can be found in Trauma centres for individuals who subscribe to their own health insurance or affiliated travel insurance and protection plans.

After a spike in air ambulance crashes in the United States in the 1990s, the U.S. government and the Commission on Air Medical Transportation Systems (CAMTS) stepped up the accreditation and air ambulance flight requirements, ensuring that all pilots, personnel, and aircraft meet much higher standards than previously required.Davis, Robert. \\"Reconsidering air ambulance usage\\" USA Today, July 18, 2005. Retrieved: November 12, 2007. The resulting CAMTS accreditation, which applies only in the United States, includes the requirement for an air ambulance company to own and operate its own aircraft. Some air ambulance companies, realizing it is virtually impossible to have the correct medicalized aircraft for every mission, instead charter aircraft based on the mission-specific requirements. While in principle CAMTS accreditation is voluntary, a number of government jurisdictions require companies providing medical transportation services to have CAMTS accreditation to be licensed to operate. This is an increasing trend as state health services agencies address the issues surrounding the safety of emergency medical services flights. Some examples are the states of Colorado,\\"Colorado House Bill 07-1259.\\" State of Colorado. Retrieved: December 4, 2010.

According to the rationale used to justify the state of Washington's adoption of the accreditation requirements, requiring accreditation of air ambulance services provides assurance that the service meets national public safety standards. The accreditation is done by professionals who are qualified to determine air ambulance safety. In addition, compliance with accreditation standards is checked on a continual basis by the accrediting organization. Accreditation standards are periodically revised to reflect the dynamic, changing environment of medical transport, with considerable input from all disciplines of the medical profession. Other U.S. states require either CAMTS accreditation or a demonstrated equivalent, such as Rhode Island,\\"Rules and Regulations Relating to Emergency Medical Services.\\" Rhode Island Department of Health. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. and Texas, which has adopted CAMTS' Accreditation Standards (Sixth Edition, October 2004) as its own. In Texas, an operator not wishing to become CAMTS accredited must submit to an equivalent survey by state auditors who are CAMTS-trained.\\"Draft of proposed changes to the Texas Department of State Health Services rule 157.12.\\" dshs.state.tx.us. January 25, 2006. State of Texas. Retrieved: December 4, 2010.\\"Texas DSHS committee minutes Virginia and Oklahoma have also adopted CAMTS accreditation standards as their state licensing standards. While the original intent of CAMTS was to provide an American standard, air ambulance services in a number of other countries, including three in Canada and one in South Africa, have voluntarily submitted themselves to CAMTS accreditation. In the UK, the AAA has a Code of Conduct that binds one of the most regulated areas of operation together. It brings the Fundraising Standards Board, CAA / EASA and the CQC together ensuring fundraising, air and clinical operations are in line with national regulation and best practice. The code goes further with an expectation of mutual support and working within its policy and best practice guides. Japanese Physician Delivery Helicopter Medical control The nature of the air operation frequently determines the type of medical control required. In most cases, an air ambulance staffer is considerably more skilled than a typical paramedic, so medical control permits them to exercise more medical decision-making latitude. Assessment skills tend to be considerably higher, and, particularly on inter-facility transfers, permit the inclusion of functions such as reading x-rays and interpretation of lab results. This allows for planning, consultation with supervising physicians, and issuing contingency orders in case they are required during flight. Some systems operate almost entirely off-line, using protocols for almost all procedures and only resorting to on-line medical control when protocols have been exhausted. Some air ambulance operations have full-time, on-site medical directors with pertinent backgrounds (e.g., emergency medicine); others have medical directors who are only available by pager.\\"Department of Community Health Policies and Procedures.\\" EMS. Retrieved: December 4, 2010. For those systems operating on the Franco-German model, the physician is almost always physically present, and medical control is not an issue. Equipment and interiors Most aircraft used as air ambulances, with the exception of charter aircraft and some military aircraft, are equipped for advanced life support and have interiors that reflect this. The challenges in most air ambulance operations, particularly those involving helicopters, are the high ambient noise levels and limited amounts of working space, both of which create significant issues for the provision of ongoing care. While equipment tends to be high-level and very conveniently grouped, it may not be possible to perform some assessment procedures, such as chest auscultation, while in flight. In some types of aircraft, the aircraft's design means that the entire patient is not physically accessible in flight. Additional issues occur with respect to pressurization of the aircraft. Not all aircraft used as air ambulances in all jurisdictions have pressurized cabins and those that do typically tend to be pressurized to only 10,000 feet above sea level. These pressure changes require advanced knowledge by flight staff with respect to the specifics of aviation medicine, including changes in physiology and the behaviour of gases. There are a large variety of helicopter makes that are used for the civilian HEMS models. The commonly used types are the Bell 206, 407, and 429, Eurocopter AS350, BK117, EC130, EC135, EC145, and the Agusta Westland 109, 169 & 139, MD Explorer and Sikorsky S-76. Fixed-wing aircraft varieties commonly include the Learjet 35, Learjet 36, Learjet 31, King Air 90, King Air 200, Pilatus PC-12 & PC-24, and Piper Cheyenne. Due to the configuration of the medical crew and patient compartments, these aircraft are normally configured to only transport one patient but some can be configured to transport two patients if so needed. Additionally, helicopters have stricter weather minimums that they can operate in and commonly do not fly at altitudes over 10,000 feet above sea level.

By 2005, this number had reached a record high. Crash rates from 2000 to 2005 more than doubled the previous five year's rates., Levin, Alan and Robert Davis. \\"Surge in crashes scars air ambulance industry.\\" USA Today, July 17, 2005. Retrieved: November 12, 2007. To some extent, these numbers had been deemed acceptable, as it was understood that the very nature of air ambulance operations meant that, because a life was at stake, air ambulances would often operate on the very edge of their safety envelopes, going on missions in conditions where no other civilian pilot would fly. As a result, nearly fifty per cent of all EMS personnel deaths in the United States occur in air ambulance crashes. In 2006, the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that many air ambulances crashes were avoidable,\\"Official NTSB report on an air ambulance Learjet crash in San Diego, California that killed everyone on board, amounting to five deaths.\\" NTSB Publication, October 24, 2004.

Cost-effectiveness Whilst some air ambulances do have effective methods of funding, in the UK, they remain almost entirely charity funded, as improved cost-benefit ratios are generally achieved with land-based attendance and transfers. Health outcomes, for example from London's Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, remain largely the same for both air and ground-based services.Brazier, J. \\"The cost and effectiveness of the London Helicopter Emergency Medical Service.\\" J Health Serv Res Policy, 01-OCT-1996; 1(4): 232-7. Personnel The medical personnel of a helicopter ambulance has historically been a Physician/Nurse combination, Paramedic/Nurse, or a Nurse/Nurse combination. The need for a Physician/Nurse combination has diminished with more protocol and evidence-based applications for care by nurses and other clinicians and so the inclusion of respiratory therapists in all modes of air transport is becoming more prominent. =Retrieval Doctor/Physician= Retrieval Doctor/Physician — Criteria for working as a medical doctor (known as \\"physician\\" in the USA) in aeromedical services depends on the jurisdiction. In Australia, where aeromedical retrieval medicine is a well-established medical field, retrieval doctors must be experienced in a critical care specialty (i.e. anaesthesia, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine) as fully qualified specialists; specialty registrars in advanced stages of training; or general practitioners (i.e. family physicians) with broad experience in critical care and obstetrics. In the UK doctors working in HEMs are usually experienced in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, acute medicine or intensive care medicine. Some general practitioners also work for air ambulances. A formal training programme for pre-hospital emergency medicine (PHEM) in the UK now aims to produce formal PHEM consultants who have underdone specific training in working in pre-hospital care and transfer medicine. =Flight Paramedic= Flight Paramedic — A licensed paramedic with additional training as a certified flight paramedic (FP-C). The flight paramedic is usually highly trained with at least 5 years of autonomous clinical experience in high acuity environments of both pre-hospital emergency medicine and critical care transport. Flight paramedics may be certified as a FP-C or a CCEMT-P. Some hold certificates as instructors in various fields and educational topics. =Flight Nurse= Flight Nurse — a nurse specialized in patient transport in the aviation environment. The flight nurse is a member of an aeromedical evacuation crew on helicopters and airplanes, providing in- flight management and care for all types of patients. Other responsibilities may also include planning and preparing for aeromedical evacuation missions and preparing a patient care plan to facilitate patient care, comfort and safety. Flight nurses may obtain certification in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Flight Nursing (CFRN) or Critical Care (CCRN). Civilian Flight Nurses Civilian flight nurses may work for hospitals, federal, state, and local governments, private medical evacuation firms, fire departments or other agencies. They have training and medical direction that allows them to operate with a broader scope of practice and more autonomy than many other nurses. Some states require that flight nurses must also have paramedic or EMT certification to respond to pre-hospital scenes. Hospital Flight Nurses The military flight nurse performs as a member of the aeromedical evacuation crew, and functions as the senior medical member of the aeromedical evacuation team on Continental United States (CONUS), intra-theater and inter- theater flights - providing for in-flight management and nursing care for all types of patients. Other responsibilities include planning and preparing for aeromedical evacuation missions and preparing a patient positioning plan to facilitate patient care, comfort and safety. Flight nurses evaluate individual patient's in-flight needs and request appropriate medications, supplies and equipment, providing continuing nursing care from originating to destination facility. They act as liaison between medical and operational aircrews and support personnel in order to promote patient comfort and to expedite the mission, and also initiate emergency treatment for in-flight medical emergencies. =Transport Respiratory Practitioner= Transport Therapist — A highly trained respiratory practitioner (also called a respiratory therapist), typically utilized in long-distance transport situations, though able to provide care during shorter transfer. Transport Therapists may obtain Adult Critical Care Specialist (ACCS), Neonatal Transport Specialist (NPT) and Neonatal Pediatric Specialist (NPS) certifications from the National Board for Respiratory Care.

They are in Leipzig in 1876 Biography He was born in the village of Haukedalen in the parish of Førde in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. He was the son of Ole Nilsson Dvergsdalen(1815-1872) and Orlaug Andersdatter Haarklou (1808-1870). He went to Balestrand lærerskole, then attended the Stord lærerskole where he graduated in 1868. He studied organ and harmony in Drammen, then in 1872 studied with Ludvig Mathias Lindeman in Christiania (now Oslo). From 1873 to 1875 he studied with Carl Reinecke at the Leipzig Conservatory and then at the Berlin Music Academy. In 1876 Haarklou was an organist at Tangen Church at Drammen. In 1877, he conducted his first orchestral work in Bergen followed later by a concert at the Gamle Logen in Christiania. In 1880, he became an organist and conductor in Christiania , first at Sagene Church and between 1883 and 1920 in the Old Aker Church. In 1889 he conducted at Copenhagen, Berlin and Leipzig. Between 1889 and 1896, he was also a lecturer in harmonics and composition at the Christiania Music Conservatory. He had a reputation as a virtuoso on the organ, especially for his improvisations. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1911. He died in Oslo during 1925 and was buried in the cemetery at Old Aker Church. In 1927, a memorial stone in his honour was unveiled at Haukedalen.

Osceola Mine fire Smoke billowing out of the #3 shaft On September 7, 1895, a fire broke out on level 27 in the No. 3 shaft of the Osceola Mine. The cause is unknown, but the large quantity of timber in the mine contributed to the fire's ferocity. Smoke eventually reached the No. 4 shaft, where most of the bodies were found. Thirty people died, including four boys, mostly from smoke inhalation. This makes it the deadliest mine accident to occur in the Copper Country. When the fire was discovered, over 200 miners were underground.

Early life and education  Anne Catherine Albertine Isala Van Diest was born in Louvain, Belgium, 7 May 1842. She was the daughter of an open-minded surgeon and obstetrician, Isala Van Diest. Van Diest and her sisters received the same education as their brother. Their mother also took them on a trip to England, where they came into contact with the progressive environment. Secondary high schools were not yet at that time available to girls in Belgium, so Van Diest travelled to Berne, Switzerland to prepare for university. She returned to Belgium in 1873 and attempted to register with the Medical Faculty of the Catholic University of Louvain, but was hampered by the refusal of the Roman Catholic religious hierarchy, who suggested to her that she instead become a midwife. She refused this proposal and returned to Bern, since the Swiss universities were the first of Europe to open up to women and she could pursue medical studies there. She graduated in 1879. Career Van Diest practised her profession for two years in England, where women doctors were free to practise since 1866. She was attached to the New Hospital for Women, and during the time she met many British feminists. She once again returned to Belgium, however, to be able to have her medical qualifications recognized, she was forced to complete additional courses at the Free University of Brussels, open to women since 1880. It then took a Royal Decree in 1884, in order to be allowed to open her own medical practice in Brussels. Many of her patients came from the upper classes of Brussels society, but she also treated pensioners at a nursing home for elderly prostitutes and fought for better treatment for prostitutes. A feminist, she founded the Belgian Women's Rights League (Ligue belge du droit des femmes) with Marie Popelin, the first Belgian woman to receive a degree in Law. In 1902, progressively losing her eyesight, she ended her professional activities and moved to Knokke, where she passed her final years.  Death and legacy  She died in Ixelles, Belgium, 6 February 1916. Van Diest and Marie Popelin were together depicted on the 2 euro commemorative coin, 5 million of which were minted in 2011 by the National Bank of Belgium on the occasion of the centenary of International Women's Day.

It opened off-Broadway in December 2005 at The Coop Theatre Company in Los Angeles and is published by YouthPlays, Inc. The play was written as a modern fairytale, blending elements of the western European Brothers Grimm fairy tale and Japanese folklore. The Christmas Princess is a popular choice for school drama programs and community theatre groups. Productions The original production opened on December 2, 2005, at the off-Broadway Coop Theatre Company (now closed, located on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles.) Robert Miano originated the role of King Heironymous. The play was revived in 2007 at the Black Box Theatre. The 2007 production of the play was directed by Paul Messinger and choreographed by Monica Juodvalkis. The Christmas Princess marked the stage debut of noted TV and movie actor and teen idol Erik von Detten, who played the role of the handsome Prince. In December 2009, the play was revived at the 3rd Street Promenade playhouse in Santa Monica. Only one actor has played in all three of the Los Angeles performances - John Frank, who originated the role of the Jester, before playing the Bear and finally King Heironymous. The play was revived again by the Fremont Civic Theatre, and by the Magnolia Arts Council in Arkansas and the Muskegon Civic Theatre in Michigan. Plot The story is introduced by a jester – the worst jester ever: A fictional medieval kingdom is ruled by a cold-hearted queen and a gruff and imperious king (King Heironymous). They have arranged for their daughter – the most beautiful (and incredibly spoiled) princess to marry a handsome – but dumb as a bucket of rocks – prince on Christmas Day. The Jester has failed to make the king laugh, and the King gives him an ultimatum: make him laugh by Christmas Day or be banished to a dungeon. Unhappy with her parents' choice, and desperate to find a way out of the marriage, the Princess disguises herself as a maid, and seeks the advice of Watt the Witch, who sends her on a quest to find three magical gifts that will allow her to escape the wedding. The crisis escalates when the handsome though dim-witted prince arrives a day early – and falls for the maid, whom he believes to be the princess. While the Princess meets a handsome – but poor – woodsman, and tackles a scary bear and an even scarier dragon on her journey, the Jester conspires to keep the King from discovering the truth. By Christmas morning, the Princess has retrieved her magical gifts – although they turn out to be far less magical than she thought; and the King and Queen discover the Maid and the Prince – but when the Woodsman and the Prince turn out to be impostors as well, everyone, in classic fairy-tale tradition, lives happily ever after.

The program replaces the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program canceled in 2011. Originally a plan to develop a high-water-speed vehicle, the program has expanded into a multi-phased approach to procure and develop several types of amphibious-capable vehicles to address near and long- term requirements. Design requirements =Original requirements= The ACV should have countermeasures able to contend with a full range of direct fire, indirect fire, and land mine threats. Visible and thermal signature reduction technologies will also be utilized. Modular protection can be applied as necessary. The vehicle must have the capability to transition from water to ground operations without tactical pause. It must be able to maneuver with the M1A1 Abrams in a mechanized task force. It must have the capability to destroy combat vehicles similar to itself. Weapons must have sufficient range to engage targets from a standoff distance. Weapons will apply precision fire from a stabilized system. It must provide direct fire support for dismounted infantry in an attack. The Marine Corps identified speed on water as a top requirement, even at the cost of troop carrying capacity.Marine Corps Insists on High Speed ACV - DoDBuzz.com, May 14, 2013 The ACV must be able to self- deploy from an amphibious assault ship at least 12 miles from shore with 17 Marines aboard. It has to be able to travel 8 knots or faster through seas with waves up to three feet. The vehicle was to be operational between 2020 and 2022, with 573 vehicles planned to be procured.Amphibious Combat Vehicle Stalled Amidst Budget, Requirements Uncertainty - Nationaldefensemagazine.com, February 2013. =Revised requirements= Given the budget environment and the technological challenges involved, the ACV program was split into two separate phases. The first phase is for immediate upgrade to existing equipment types while testing and trying out new concepts. The second phase is to develop then field a single, ultimate vehicle using new technology and the lessons learned operating the improved vehicles to replace the equipment from the first phase. Phase 1 The first phase, will consist of several hundred commercial off-the-shelf wheeled armored vehicles each costing $3–$4.5 million. It will rely on connectors to get it from ship-to-shore, like the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) and Joint High Speed Vessel. Relying on connectors to bring the vehicle to a beach allows the sea base to be located 100 miles from enemy threats. The less ambitious Phase 1 ACV will be fielded in the interim, while research and development will commence to refine the features of the Phase 2 ACV.Marine Corps Scraps Tracks for Amphibious Combat Vehicle - Defensetech.org, 4 April 2014 Phase 1.1, the first increment of Phase 1 of procurement, will buy wheeled personnel carriers. Phase 1.2, the second increment of Phase 1, will include mission-role variants like command-and- control and logistics, and weapons variants; these iterations may reintroduce tracks or stay wheeled.Marines Favor Wheeled Ship-to-Shore Vehicles - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 26 June 2014 ACV 1.1 vehicles will be an operational and commercially available design that is \\"good enough\\" to operate. Its water performance will be comparable to the AAV, and will have survivability attributes of an Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, including high-ground clearance and a V-shaped hull, with the ability to drive with a wheel blown off. For the second lot buy (1.2), engineering and design changes will be made to meet roughly half of desired amphibious vehicle fleet size requirements. The ACV 1.1 is to carry 10–13 Marines, have a swim capability similar to the AAV, and have equal or greater mobility to the M1 Abrams tank. Although tracks are traditionally considered better for all- terrain mobility, the Marines believe wheeled vehicle technology has advanced enough to enhance survivability and mobility in a 35-ton-class platform; the Marine Personnel Carrier technology demonstrator used \\"in-line\\" drive technology that enabled all four wheels on each side to pull together much like the way a track does. This demonstrated ability when combined with a higher ground clearance and central tire inflation system, substantially closes the maneuverability gap for wheeled vehicles and results in equal or better maneuverability than the M1A1 and better performance over the AAV, both of which are tracked. Improved technology used to inform requirements to build ACV 1.2 vehicles will later be applied to delivered 1.1 versions to upgrade them to 1.2 standard.The Amphibious Combat Vehicle - MCafdn.org, 10 September 2014Corps Eyes New Amphibious Assault Vehicles - Defensetech.org, 25 September 2014 Each ACV 1.1 vehicle will have a 3-man crew, and two vehicles will carry a reinforced rifle squad. Armament will consist of an M2 .50-caliber machine gun in a remote weapons station, with the potential to install a stabilized dual-mount M2/Mark 19 grenade launcher turret. Potential water speeds are for a ship-to-shore capability at 8 knots.High Water-Speed Still a Priority for Marine Corps' Amphibious Assault Vehicle - Nationdefensemagazine.org, 18 November 2014 Phase 2 The second phase is the original high-water- speed effort to develop a vehicle capable of self-deployment from ships and travel at speeds of 13–15 knots on water, each costing $12–$14 million. This last phase of ACV procurement would be purchasing a high-water-speed vehicle, but only if technologies make it achievable without sacrificing armor and weapons.Future Marine Corps Missions Depend on New Ship-To-Shore Connectors - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 16 July 2014  History  A Request For Information (RFI) was issued to industry on 17 February 2011. The document outlined expected requirements and asked industry for informal design proposals and program methodology feedback. Responses were due by 22 April 2011. An industry day was held on 6 April 2011. In August 2012, General Dynamics was awarded an ACV Hull Survivability Demonstrator contract for the design, fabrication, and test support of a full-scale hull to demonstrate crew-protection technologies. In November 2012, they conducted simulated mine- blast tests on their ACV ballistic hull design, successfully meeting mine- blast survivability requirements. Work concluded by May 2013 and will be used to refine requirements for effective protection against under-vehicle threats.General Dynamics Amphibious Combat Vehicle Hull Design Meets Marine Corps' Survivability Requirement - Prnewswire.com, 5 November 2012. In April 2013, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded a $1 million prize to a team in the Fast Adaptable Next-Generation Ground Vehicle (FANG) contest. The team beat out 1,000 other competitors to submit their design for a drivetrain for the ACV. The FANG initiative was to demonstrate a way to procure working systems better than the current defense acquisition process, which frequently leads to delays and cost overruns. The Marines are in charge of the ACV program, so there was no guarantee that the DARPA-crowdsourced mobility drivetrain would result in a vehicle bought by the Corps.This Is the Million-Dollar Design for Darpa’s Crowdsourced Swimming Tank - Wired.com, April 22, 2013 At a roundtable discussion on 26 June 2013, Marine Corps General Jim Amos told the media that the program was still being pursued, and that a Request For Proposals (RFP) would be issued in early 2014. The Corps has secured and saved a \\"moderate amount\\" of money for early development. With the previous EFV cancelled from cost overruns, the Marines are being cautious to identify trade-offs between requirements and cost for the platform. Amos noted that they were working with contractors to see which type of vehicle would meet requirements without proving too costly.RFP For Marine Corps ACV Expected In 2014 - Aviationweek.com, 26 June 2013 In January 2013, the ACV team was created and tasked to evaluate the feasibility of building an affordable, survivable amphibious high water speed vehicle. The team includes representatives from over six Department of Defense commands. Their initial requirements and engineering analysis evaluated 198 requirements for the platform. From July 9–11, 2013, 25 Marines gathered at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia for a Warfighter Requirements Workshop to review the team's capabilities analysis and determine the value of various capabilities. 30 requirements with cost and weight implications were considered \\"tradable,\\" including armament and armor protection. Safety and design-specific capabilities, like transportability (fitting on an amphibious ship) were considered non-tradable. The point of the workshop was to get input from fleet Marines about what capabilities they wanted to prioritize with current financial pressures. Over the next month, the team ordered the preferences and applied actual cost and weight data to determine feasibility recommendations for Marine Corps leaders by the fall.ACV team seeks Marines’ insight into vehicle requirements - MarCorSysCom.Marines.mil, 15 July 2013 The Marine Corps feels they have only one opportunity to get the ACV program right, partly from the previous EFV program being cancelled in 2011 after using $3 billion in development and also from severely reduced budgets for the rest of the decade compared to the previous one. They may not even know exactly what they want and can afford from the vehicle. Trade studies began in January 2013 and were to be conducted for six months, but they were extended another six months. With the service's normally tight budget combined with sequester cuts, giving priority to the ACV may take funding and resources from other programs. The plan to begin buying 5,500 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) around 2019 could have been replaced with retaining and modernizing up-armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and keeping the large numbers of relatively young Oshkosh M-ATVs. The Corps' preference for the ACV over the JLTV and willingness to sacrifice it is partly to maintain the ability to make amphibious landings. The amphibious-capable Marine Personnel Carrier is a program to create a better vehicle to transport Marines after they come ashore. In June 2013, budgetary pressures forced the MPC program to be suspended for up to a decade to focus funding on other priorities.Marines Tread Carefully in Search for New Amphibious Vehicle - Defensenews.com, 20 September 2013 General Amos received an Analysis of Alternatives for the ACV in November 2013, so it was unlikely he could make a decision on whether to develop or buy a vehicle in the Marine's FY 2015 budget request, due February 2014. Despite the Marine's ship-to-shore amphibious landing role and the ACV being declared the service's number-one priority, there are factors that put its future in doubt. Options for vehicle capabilities were to create a high- speed platform that meets desired goals which may come out to be too expensive like the previous EFV program, create a low-speed platform with reduced performance for affordability which may not be enough of an improvement over the AAV it is replacing, or delay the effort for more research and development time to refine requirements and wait for budget problems to pass. If creating a new amphibious vehicle were delayed, the Marines would have to rely more on the MV-22 Osprey and other helicopters in the near-future for moving troops to a breach, which cannot support them on the ground or protect them under armor. A high-speed vehicle may not even be viable for future assault landings, as even though it would be made to deploy further out to sea to give stand-off protection of transport ships from anti-ship missiles, the ACV itself would then be vulnerable to those missiles. Methods of traveling on water are limited to current and slow methods through it or traveling on top, similar to a jet ski, which is expensive. How an amphibious vehicle will perform fighting on land is uncertain. AAVs had mixed success in Iraq and were vulnerable to improvised explosive devices (IED), which endangers more troops with the higher carrying capacity of amphibious vehicles over regular infantry fighting vehicles (IFV). The U.S. Army faced the same threats, and their Ground Combat Vehicle program aimed for the greatest protection without excessive weight or costs. The Marine ACV is attempting to be fast and as protected as it can while keeping costs down. Electrical power generation is important given the growing number of dismounted electronics. The Army Stryker can generate 50 percent more electricity than the M2 Bradley IFV, but that requires a larger engine and higher costs. General Amos had previously wanted to procure the JLTV as fast as possible to be ready for ACV production, but with sequestration giving up buying the JLTV for the Marine Corps was seriously being considered. The ACV is strictly a Marine Corps program without a basic design settled upon yet. Its best hope is to show it can be part of the military's AirSea Battle strategy to seize and defend island bases, which is primarily the Marine Corps' mission.Marines 2014: Year Of Decision For Amphibious Combat Vehicle - Breakingdefense.com, 9 January 2014 In January 2014, General Amos signaled a \\"phased approach\\" to creating the ACV in which he lessened the importance of speed on water as an immediate requirement for the vehicle. Speed on water had been identified as a crucial need to quickly reach the beach so Marines could fight inland. Given budgetary pressures, Phase 1 of the program would consist of creating a vehicle they can afford quickly to replace the AAV, which are around 40 years old. Phase 2 would include future science and technology developments like higher speeds. The Phase 1 ACV seems to be an improved AAV that will drive straight through water like its predecessors, while attempts to create a sea-skimming vehicle led to the ill-fated EFV. While a high-speed amphibious vehicle is believed to be feasible and affordable, there would be too many trade-offs in performance capabilities. The main purpose of the ACV is to move Marines from ship-to- shore, but after that they primarily fight on land, asserting the need for ground fighting capabilities. Conventional ground fighting vehicles can be transported by landing craft like the Landing Craft Utility (LCU) and Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), but amphibious landing ships are able to carry many times more AMTRACs than they can other landing craft or hovercraft carrying vehicles. LCACs can move to a beach faster, but cannot travel inland and are not able to take enemy fire. Moving vehicles with few LCACs would require multiple trips, taking up time and leaving the hovercraft vulnerable for longer.Amos Says Marines To Drop High Speed ACV, For Now; Phased Approach Likely - Breakingdefense.com, 29 January 2014 =Increments= Shortly after the Marine Corps submitted their FY 2015 budget request in February 2014, General Amos decided to postpone development of the ACV and return funding to the Marine Personnel Carrier program. Originally, the Marines planned to buy both the ACV and MPC to replace outdated vehicles to complement each other for different missions. During an amphibious assault, a limited number of ACVs would carry the initial landing force from ship to shore and further inland. After the beach was secured, a larger number of MPCs would be landed by landing craft to reinforce the first wave. When budgets tightened, the ACV was taken as the priority and funding was removed from the MPC, with the service figuring they could buy an off-the-shelf wheeled troop transport later when money was available. Technical challenges to the proposed ACV continued to mount as funds kept getting constrained, so the decision was made that wheeled APC advancements where significant enough to address needs quicker. Marines still want a high-speed fully amphibious vehicle to move troops from the ocean to a beach with enough armor, mobility, and firepower to fight while on land, which was proposed as ACV Phase 2.Marines Budget Scramble: Commandant Resurrects MPC, ACV In Limbo - Breakingdefense.com, 17 February 2014 The Marine Corps plan to modernize its amphibious invasion force has three parts: upgrade 390 AAVs; buy 600 troop transports as part of ACV Phase 1; and do research for an ACV 2.0 \\"high-water-speed\\" option. Upgrades to the AAV will be added to around 392 vehicles (carrying one Marine brigade) out of the fleet of 1,062, including \\"limited survivability upgrades\\" of blast-resistant seats, additional armor, and a new transmission. Having AAVs self-deploy directly from ships is quicker than loading vehicles onto a connector, but long-range anti-ship missiles will force future amphibious invasion forces to stay between from shore. A high-speed connector can make that trip in 1–3 hours, while an AAV on water would take 15 hours to travel that distance. The Phase 1 ACV will be 200 modified versions of an existing U.S. or foreign armored vehicle to enter service around 2020. It will have limited amphibious capabilities to cross rivers and coastal inlets and be carried on a landing craft miles from shore, which will deploy it from the shoreline to swim the rest of the way. Seaborne requirements are likely for operation in sea state 3, against modest winds and -high waves, taking about one hour. ACV 1.1 will likely have a higher swim standard than the previous MPC. ACV 1.2 is to buy an additional 400 amphibious vehicles in multiple variants including troop transport, command, and fire support. A Phase 1 ACV that can self-deploy without a landing craft would have an advantage, but that capability is not a requirement. ACV 2.0 is research for a new amphibious vehicle, a new fast landing craft for the ACV 1, or some undecided alternative. Aside from wartime amphibious assaults, the Marine Corps has other needs for amphibious vehicles. In relief operations during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, there was no combat, but ships could not dock in the country's damaged ports, and helicopters could not move the amount of cargo necessary, so AAVs were relied upon to transport supplies ashore.A Sneak Peek At Marines' New Amphibious Combat Vehicle - Breakingdefense.com, 2 April 2014 A critique of the ACV effort authored by retired infantry officers and armor experts and published by Marine Corps Times in June 2014 were critical of developing a new amphibious personnel carrier. Due to the proliferation of anti-ship missiles, Navy ships will have to remain some 100 miles from a landing area. The critique claimed that an armored ACV would swim too slowly through the water and that the Marines would be relying on the Navy for the use of connectors to travel from the stand-off distance, despite the fact that no connectors currently exist to transport a mid-sized landing force. It recommended scrapping the ACV, modifying current Light Armored Vehicles, and emphasizing procurement of the CH-53K King Stallion to transport them. In response, General Amos defended the program and his decision to re-focus its priority from speed on water to ground performance. Since the mid-2000s, MRAP vehicles set a new standard for combat vehicle armor protection. With the ACV actually fighting on land, ruggedness and survivability are main features, so using a lighter and less-armored vehicle is not feasible. To transport them, Amos has suggested modifying Navy Joint High Speed Vessels (JHSV) with a ramp to deploy the ACV; a JHSV with a ramp can carry up to 30 of the vehicles, go from the fleet to the coast at 50 mph, and drop them off to swim the rest of the way to shore. Assistance could be provided by DARPA and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to add more technologies and capabilities to existing or future connectors.\\"Amos rejects recent critique of amphibious combat vehicle\\" , Marine Corps Times, 25 June 2014 On 11 July 2014, General Dynamics was awarded a contract extension to continue work on determining the best option for developing an affordable, survivable, and high water speed ACV platform. The effort includes analyzing the flexibility and modularity of requirements, concept refinement, and experimentation planning to help the Marine Corps understand risks and determine the best approach for ACV development.\\"General Dynamics to Continue Amphibious Combat Vehicle Testing for Marine Corps\\" , Seapower Magazine, 11 July 2014 Amphibious Combat Vehicle developments are incorporated into the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Force 21 future amphibious assault strategy, which rely on launching 65–100 miles from shore in small landing teams to exploit gaps in enemy defenses, rather than previous methods of deploying a large contingent across a beach in a major assault. A future Marine expeditionary brigade operation would require 400 AAVs and 700 ACVs distributed through a series of naval connectors over a series of phases; due to the smaller vehicle manning capabilities of the ACV, fleet size would need to increase by one- quarter to one-third to move one company of Marines. About 400 AAVs will be upgraded with MRAP-level protection features including enhanced underbelly armor, seating, fueling systems, and fire protection, which will begin deliveries in 2019; AAVs will still be part of the initial wave, while ACVs arrive in subsequent waves. ACV 1.1 includes the four competitors of the previous Marine Personnel Carrier program and their entries, as well as a fifth unnamed company. Results of ACV 1.1 vehicles will be used to generate requirements for ACV 1.2, an enhanced capability version of the original vehicle with potentially greater speed or carrying capacity, and available in probable mission variants. The ACVs will mainly be deployed using naval connectors to get from ship to shore, as will JLTVs, which the Marines will begin buying 5,500 of in 2015 as part of their wheeled vehicle modernization strategy. ACV Phase 2 is a planning construct to develop a high-speed, independently deploying vehicle, but there are several other options including creating two vehicles, another wheeled or tracked vehicle, and another high- speed naval connector. If ACV Phase 2 becomes infeasible, the Marine Corps fallback plan is the ACV 1.3, with a 600-vehicle buy to replace the AAV fleet.\\"Marines upgrading, replacing amphibs under new strategy\\", Military Times, 24 September 2014 An RFP for ACV 1.1 was issued in November 2014. Even though the Marine Corps has spent $3.5 billion on four failed high-water speed amphibious vehicles over the past 25 years, such a vehicle is still a requirement for the Corps. Creating a vehicle that can travel on water at 25 knots is technically feasible, but it requires tradeoffs to be made survivability and lethality. Three possibilities are being explored to create a vehicle that can balance required capabilities for ACV Phase 2. One is to upgrade the ACV Phase 1 vehicle or another existing vehicle to have high-water speed. Another is the desired creation of an entirely new \\"clean sheet\\" design. If neither of those paths can develop technologies for a vehicle, the last effort involves further development of ship-to-shore connectors to bring vehicles ashore. The ONR, industry, and Navy personnel are exploring these possibilities and are to report their findings by 2025. In March 2015, the Marines revealed that the separate ACV 1.1 and 1.2 increments may be merged into a single vehicle. Given that the winner of phase 1.1 will likely be awarded the 1.2 contract, industry is already planning to make their submissions meet the later requirements early. The main differences between the phases is the 1.2's greater self-deploying capability and more seating capacity. Merging the two phases to meet higher requirements earlier could speed up the acquisition timeline and drive down price, since the quantities for both would be bought in bulk.Marines May Merge ACV Increments as Industry Chases Higher Requirements - News.USNI.org, 11 March 2015 The Marines released the final RFP for ACV 1.1 on 26 March 2015.Marine Corps Releases Amphibious Combat Vehicle RFP - News.USNI.org, 1 April 2015 In July 2015, Lockheed Martin revealed it had ended its association with Finnish company Patria on their previous collaborative Havoc offering for the program.Lockheed Martin Ends Collaboration with Patria on Havoc & Will Present its Own Design for ACV - Armyrecognition.com, 11 July 2015 Lockheed unveiled their new ACV offering in September 2015.Lockheed Martin Introduces New ACV Candidate at Modern Day Marine Show - Armyrecognition.com, 23 September 2015 In October 2017 deputy Marine commandant Lt. Gen. Brian Beaudreault stated \\"We have to find a solution to getting Marines to shore, from over the horizon, at something greater than seven knots (8 mph),\\" the swimming speed of the existing Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) and its Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) replacement. Continuing, he said \\"we must find a high-water-speed vehicle on the surface. We must.\\" https://breakingdefense.com/2017/10/marines-need-speed- from-ship-to-shore/ The Deputy Commandant's statements seemly contradict the phased approach to having a non-self deploying vehicle in the ACV 1.1 and then a fully amphibious vehicle in ACV 1.2. The question remains if the Marines are still interested in procuring a high speed connector vehicle after merging ACV 1.1 and 1.2. 750px In May 2018 a former Marine officer, Jeff Groom, published an article concerning the ACV. Both BAE System's and SAIC's ACV 1.1 test vehicles could self-deploy and swim from a ship in contradiction to General Dunford's testimony in March 2015. However, there is apparently no longer a need for speed on water as both test vehicles move through the water at 7 knots using traditional water propellers, the same speed as the legacy 1970s AAV. The article questioned the acquisition decision of a vehicle that swims at the same speed as the vehicle it replaces, carries fewer troops, and is more expensive.http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/amphibious- vehicles-are-the-militarys-latest-tax-dollar-sinkhole/ =Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase= On 24 November 2015, the Marines selected the BAE Systems SuperAV and SAIC Terrex to move on to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the ACV 1.1 program, beating out Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems.

MacDonald was admired for his creative mind, and his ability to connect scientific issues and matters of public policy.Walter Munk, Naomi Oreskes, and Richard Muller (2004) Gordon James Fraser MacDonald, Biographical Memoirs of the NAS, vol. 84, p. 225.Leon Knopoff and Sven Treitel (2003) Gordon J.F. MacDonald, Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union, vol. 84, no. 5, p. 40. MacDonald was born in Mexico of a Scottish father and American mother. A childhood bout with polio only sharpened his competitive instincts. He applied to Harvard for a football scholarship and graduated summa cum laude at the age of 20. Remaining at Harvard, he became a Harvard Junior Fellow, then received his Ph.D. in geology in 1954. MacDonald was a faculty member at MIT (1954–1958), UCLA (1958–1966), UC Santa Barbara (1968–1970), Dartmouth (1972–1983) and UCSD (1990–1996).Thomas Gold (2002) Obituary: Gordon James Fraser MacDonald, Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, vol. 34, no. 4, p. 1367-1368. Outside of academia, MacDonald was a long-time member of the elite JASON advisory group of scientists. He served on the original Presidential Council on Environmental Quality (1970–1972). President Nixon remarked at the time, \\"I have three members of the Harvard class of 1950 on my staff, all summa cum laude.\\" The reference was to Henry Kissinger, James Schlesinger, and MacDonald. MacDonald chaired the CIA's MEDEA Committee (1993–1996), a group of environmental scientists convened by the CIA to study whether data from classified intelligence systems could shed light on global environmental issues. He was awarded the CIA's Agency Seal Medallion in 1994. He was Chief Scientist and Vice President of the MITRE Corporation from 1983 to 1990. He later became the director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.  McNamara Line  MacDonald chaired the JASON committee that designed the Vietnam War's \\"McNamara Line\\" system of electronic border surveillance. The JASON scientists came under widespread public attack during the Vietnam War; MacDonald's garage in Santa Barbara was burned down.  Plate tectonics  MacDonald's early skepticism regarding plate tectonics stemmed from his detailed study, with Walter Munk, of the rotation of the Earth. Since small polar motions are readily detectable on human time scales, the possibility of explaining paleomagnetic data by polar wandering seemed, for a time, to be a viable possibility; plate tectonic motions are now considered to be the correct explanation.  Climate change  MacDonald was a prominent early scientific advocate of action to address the threat of global warming from fossil-fuel combustion. By the 1960s, MacDonald was publicly concerned about the potential risks of industrial climate change, both aerosol-induced global cooling and carbon-dioxide driven global warming. MacDonald contributed to the President's Science Advisory Committee environmental report in 1965 and the National Academy of Sciences report in 1966 that warned of such risks. In 1969 he began a JASON project to model climate change that soon convinced him that fossil-fuel burning would lead to dangerous global warming that would outstrip any industrial cooling effects. In 1978 MacDonald appeared on The MacNeil/Lehrer Report, and in 1979 was in an issue of People Magazine, to warn about fossil-fuel-driven global warming. In 1980 testimony to Congress, he warned that the climate changes due to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would \\"probably have a profound effect on agriculture, on all aspects of energy use and generation, and on water and land use.\\" \\"The dilemma we face is of historic proportions,\\" he said. \\"Economies around the world depend on the energy derived from carbon- based fuels. The continued use of these fuels will irreversibly change global climate, placing heavy stresses on societies around the world.\\" MacDonald's interest in climate change was related to his work on weather modification, a controversial but once seemingly viable enterprise. He served on the NSF Advisory Panel for Weather Modification in 1964-1967. That panel's conclusion, that weather modification was possible, was immediately attacked on statistical grounds. An article in the Journal of the American Statistical Association (June, 1967) concluded, \\"That such nonsense should appear under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences is deplorable.\\" MacDonald also published work on other aspects of climatology, hypothesizing the role of Milankovitch cycles and methane clathrates as drivers of natural climate changes. In 2002, he published a book involving his research with fellow JASON physicist Richard A. Muller.  Awards and recognition  A member of the National Academy of Sciences (elected at the age of 32), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, MacDonald was also the recipient of the James B. Macelwane Medal of the American Geophysical Union (1965). MacDonald's opinion about an inhibiting impact of funding, policy and politics on scientific innovation is reflected in this 2003 quote, ”In all science there is a strong 'herd instinct', and interactions occur largely within these herds. They may argue vigorously about details, but they maintain solidarity, or close ranks, when challenged by other herds or individuals. The herd instinct is strengthened greatly if those making funding decisions are members of that herd. Strays do not get funded, and their work, no matter how innovative, is neglected as the herd rumbles on. Herd members will change their views rapidly, however, if the herd leaders change direction. By contrast, if the innovators are not part of the herd it becomes very difficult, or impossible, for them to change the herd's direction.” Macdonald G J. How mobile is the earth?. In: Oreski N (ed).

The Royal Navy named her HMS Dunira, and then renamed her HMS Immortalite but never commissioned her nor fitted her for sea. In March 1822 she became a receiving ship at Portsmouth. She was sold in January 1837. In 1813, along with Iphigénie, she served at Cherbourg, in the squadron of contre-amiral Amable Troude, to protect the harbour. Capture Plan of the Immortalite On 16 January 1814, the 74-gun third-rate ship of the line , her prize, the ex-French letter of marque brig Jason, and were in company when they spotted two 44-gun French frigates, Alcmène and Iphigénie. Venerable joined her and after a chase that left Cyane far behind, captured Alcmène, though not without a fight. Venerable lost two men dead and four wounded, while the French lost 32 dead and 50 wounded. Alcmène had a complement of 319 men under the command of Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve, who was wounded when he brought her alongside Venerable and attempted a boarding.’’Naval Chronicle’’, Vol. 31, pp.244-5. Jason and Cyane tracked Iphigénie and initially fired on her but broke off the engagement because they were outgunned. Cyane continued the chase for over three days until Venerable was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that Iphigénie had taken. On 20 January 1814, Venerable captured the quarry, having again left Cyane behind. She apparently did not resist after Venerable came up. Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.James & Chamier (1837), Vol. 6, pp.259-61. The action resulted in the award in 1847, to any surviving claimants, of the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Venerable 16 Jany 1814\\" and \\"Cyane 16 Jany. 1814\\". Venerable was able to locate Iphigénie because Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve of Alcmène was so angry at Captain Émeric, who was the senior French commander, for not having come alongside Venerable on the other side also to board, that he essentially revealed the rendezvous instructions to Admiral Durham. (Venerable was Durham's flagship). When some prisoners from Iphigénies crew were brought on Venerable, crew from Alcmène too were enraged. Durham had to station Royal Marines between them, with fixed bayonets, to prevent fighting from breaking out. Fate The Royal Navy never commissioned Alcmène. The Admiralty initially named her Dunira. On 8 July, Lieutenant Edward Boys, formerly of Venerable, was confirmed in command of Dunira, but was put on half-pay in September. Then on 8 November the Admiralty renamed her Immortalite. Immortalite became a receiving ship at Portsmouth in March 1822. She may have served for a while in the Quarantine Service at Standgate Creek. She was sold in January 1837 to a Mr. W.

The Cyanide Code is intended to reduce the potential exposure of workers and communities to harmful concentrations of cyanide‚ to limit releases of cyanide to the environment‚ and to enhance response actions in the event of an exposure or release. The Cyanide Code was one of the earliest standards and certification programs developed for the minerals sector. Today, it is amongst the most established certification programs in the mining industry. The program's audit process and the transparency of audit results set it apart from other voluntary industry programs. Cyanide in gold mining Cyanide is a general term for a group of chemicals containing carbon and nitrogen. Cyanide compounds include both naturally occurring and human-made chemicals. In nature, cyanide is present naturally in plants including bitter almonds apples, peaches, apricots, lima beans, barley, sorghum, flaxseed and bamboo shoots. Some scientists suggest that the reason why these plants contain cyanide, which can be toxic, is that evolution has designed them to discourage insects from feasting on them. Although cyanide can be toxic to humans, eating cyanide-containing foods generally is not harmful because cyanide is present in very low amounts, is often contained in seeds which are discarded, or is washed away when the food is prepared. Cyanide can be acutely toxic to humans, other mammals and aquatic species, as it interferes with oxygen utilization. Cyanide does not bioaccumulate, and a non-lethal dose is metabolized in the body. Cyanide is not carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic. Cyanide comes in many forms including hydrogen cyanide (HCN), cyanogen chloride (CNCl), and salts such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN). In manufacturing, cyanide is used to make paper, textiles, and plastics. Cyanide salts are used in metallurgy for electroplating, metal cleaning, and removing gold from its ore. Cyanide gas is used to exterminate pests and vermin in ships and buildings. Cyanide is a basic building block for the chemical industry. About 80% of global cyanide production is used to synthesize a wide range of industrial organic chemicals such as nylon and acrylics. It is estimated that less than 20% of manufactured cyanide is used in mineral processing in the form of sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887 because it is one of only a few chemical reagents that will dissolve gold in water. This allows the efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore. Commercial gold mining operations use very dilute solutions of sodium cyanide, typically in the range of 0.01% and 0.05% cyanide (100 to 500 parts per million). Cyanide should be strictly controlled on mine sites, and proper management requires that certain precautions be taken to limit worker exposure and to prevent chemical solutions containing cyanide from entering the environment. The most-used process of removing gold from ore is through leaching. In the leaching process, sodium cyanide is dissolved in water where, under mildly oxidizing conditions, it dissolves the gold contained in the crushed gold ore. The resultant gold-bearing solution is called 'pregnant solution.' Either zinc metal or activated carbon is then added to the pregnant solution to recover the gold by removing it from the solution. There are two main leaching methods for gold extraction using cyanide. The first is 'heap' leaching in which the dilute cyanide solution is sprayed on large piles or heaps of coarse gold ore. The solution percolates through the pile dissolving the gold and the pregnant solution is then collected. This method is mainly used for ore with lower concentrations of gold. The other method is 'vat' leaching in which the process is similar but the gold ore is finely ground and leaching takes place in a tank or vat. Vat leaching is used mainly for ores with higher concentrations of gold due to the cost of milling the ore to a very small particle size. Alternative lixiviant (leaching) chemicals to cyanide (for example thiourea, sodium bromide) have been investigated for many years, but they are generally less effective and/or economical than cyanide, and they also present environmental risks that can be greater than cyanide. Because cyanide is toxic if not properly handled, its use is highly regulated in most countries. Despite regulatory and voluntary safeguards, however, some jurisdictions have banned its use in gold mining. These include Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Hungary. Several provinces in Argentina also prohibit the use of cyanide in mining. In the U.S., the state of Montana has taken action to ban cyanide in gold production. History Cyanide, a highly toxic chemical, has been the most widely used reagent for extracting gold from ore for the past century. The Cyanide Code grew out of the first-of-its-kind workshop of multi-stakeholders held in Paris in May, 2000 convened to consider developing a code of best practice for the use of cyanide in gold mining in response to a tailings spill from the Aural Mine at Baia Mare in Romania in January 2000. The meeting was co-hosted by The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Council on Metals and the Environment (now the International Council on Mining and Metals). Workshop participants were almost 40 representatives of such diverse organizations as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the Mineral Policy Center (now Earthworks), the Sierra Club, and the World Gold Council, along with representation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the governments of Australia, France, Hungary, Romania, and the world's leading gold producers and cyanide producers. As a result of the workshop, a multi-stakeholder steering committee was established to oversee development of a code of best practice for the management of cyanide used for gold recovery. The committee met five times over a 13-month period starting in late 2000, and each successive draft of the best practice document it produced was made available to the public on the UNEP web site with an open invitation for comments. The committee also solicited comments directly from 140 groups and individuals, including governments, NGOs, academics, consultants, industry, and financial institutions, and received 68 written responses and 15 stakeholder presentations at its meetings. In early 2002, the committee completed the International Cyanide Management Code for The Manufacture, Transport and Use of Cyanide In The Production of Gold. As conceived by the steering committee, the Cyanide Code was more than a guide to best management practices for the use of cyanide in the production of gold. The Cyanide Code also addressed the safe manufacture and transport of the cyanide used in the gold industry. Further, although the program is voluntary, the Cyanide Code includes a process by which its implementation at gold mines and other facilities is verified by independent third-party professional auditors and audit results are made available to the public. The International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) was established in 2003 to oversee the Cyanide Code's implementation and verification, and by 2005, the administrative procedures, audit protocols and guidance documents necessary for full program implementation had been developed. 2015 marked the tenth year of implementation of the Cyanide Code globally. In 2017, the International Cyanide Management Institute undertook a public consultation process to determine if the Cyanide Code should be extended to include primary silver mines, which is defined as an operation where silver is the main commodity produced. About 30% of the world's silver production comes from primary silver mines; the balance is produced as a co-product from polymetallic, base metal, or gold mines. The Institute solicited input from stakeholders on the proposal, including its advisability, policy or technical issues, and any other related matters. Following receipt of stakeholder comments, all of which were supportive of the change, ICMI's Board of Directors approved the program's expansion, effective January 1, 2017. Signatories and certification The Cyanide Code is a resource for any gold mine, cyanide producer or cyanide transporter regarding best practices for cyanide management. A company that becomes a signatory to the Cyanide Code commits to implement its Principles and Standards of Practice at its operations and to demonstrate compliance by having their facilities audited against the Cyanide Code's Verification Protocols. The first 14 Cyanide Code signatory companies were announced in November 2005. Over the past eight years, the number of companies participating in the program has substantially increased. As of January 1, 2018, the Cyanide Code had 195 signatory companies, with operations in 54 countries. These include 47 gold mining companies, 23 cyanide producers, and 125 cyanide transporters Gold mines, cyanide production facilities, and cyanide transport operations owned by Cyanide Code signatory companies are certified through a transparent process using independent third-party professional auditors and technical experts meeting requirements established by ICMI for experience and expertise. The initial audit must be conducted within three years of the facility's owner becoming a signatory, and audits to evaluate continuing compliance are conducted on a three-year interval. Operations are certified in compliance with the Cyanide Code based on the auditors’ findings, and a summary of the audit results, as well as the credentials of the auditors, are made available to the public on the Cyanide Code web site. The program's transparency gives stakeholders the ability to judge the rigor of the audit process and the audit findings. The Cyanide Code is being widely implemented in the gold mining sector. As of January 1, 2018, 279 operations had been certified in compliance with the Cyanide Code, including 99 gold mines, 30 cyanide production facilities and 150 cyanide transporters. One hundred thirty-one had been audited two or more times and found to have maintained compliance. Stakeholder perspectives The Cyanide Code has been recognized by the Group of Eight (\\"G8\\") as one of several certification systems that are suitable instruments for \\"increasing transparency and good governance in the extraction and processing of mineral raw materials.\\" The G8 is an international forum for the governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Article 85 of the G8's Summit Declaration, issued during its 2007 annual meeting, states the following: > \\"Certification systems can be a suitable instrument in appropriate cases for > increasing transparency and good governance in the extraction and processing > of mineral raw materials and to reduce environmental impacts, support the > compliance with minimum social standards and resolutely counter illegal > resource extraction. Therefore, we reaffirm our support for existing > initiatives such as … the International Cyanide Management Code, and > encourage the adaptation of the respective principles of corporate social > responsibility by those involved in the extraction and processing of mineral > resources,\\" The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a part of the World Bank that provides funding for mining projects, applies the Cyanide Code in lieu of its own requirements in its Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines for Mining. As a condition of its loans, IFC EHS Guidelines call on mines to use cyanide in a manner \\"consistent with the principles and standards of practice of the International Cyanide Management Code.\\" The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development requires Cyanide Code compliance in their loan agreements to gold mines or otherwise encourage projects they fund that use cyanide to comply with the Cyanide Code. Environment Canada's \\"Environmental Code of Practice for Metal Mines\\" cites the Cyanide Code as the guide for the environmentally responsible management of cyanide used in the production of both gold and base metals, and recommends that cyanide management planning and the transportation, storage, use and disposal of cyanide and cyanide-related materials be done \\"in a manner consistent with practices described in the International Cyanide Management Code.\\" The Australian National Industrial Chemicals’ Notification and Assessment Scheme's 2010 evaluation of the risks posed by sodium cyanide characterizes the Cyanide Code as \\"an excellent initiative to lift international standards and demonstrate the environmental commitment of an operator.\\" In a 2015 report commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the research firm Profundo noted that \\"The International Cyanide Management Code, to which all respectable mining companies subscribe, therefore governs not only the uses and storage of the chemical, but also its transport to a mine.\\" According to Benchmark Study of Environmental and Social Standards in Industrialised Precious Metals Mining produced by Solidaridad, an international network organization with more than 20 years of experience in creating fair and sustainable supply chains from producer to consumer the Cyanide Code offers \\"a good level of transparency as all of the Code’s implementing documents are available to the public on the ICMI website.\\" The Study also noted the Cyanide Code offers \\"rigorous and transparent verification of compliance, that there is \\"respect for the Code by operational staff and excellent emergency procedures.\\" In a May 2013 report titled More Substance Than Shine, several NGOs including Earthworks, MiningWatch Canada, and United Steelworkers noted that the International Cyanide Management Code is an example of a certification or monitoring system that provides audit information to the public. \\"For example, the following documents are available online: Auditor summary reports; Auditor Credential forms; Corrective Action Completion forms showing that those that did not obtain full compliance carried out the corrective actions necessary to obtain certification. Auditor summary reports also provide the basis for the findings or deficiencies identified during the audit.\\" In commenting on the stringent auditing process, a report titled Global Best Practices in Cyanide Management: The International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC) and Turkish Experience noted: \\"In summary, the ICMC is one of the most rigorous voluntary auditing benchmarks ever to be applied in any international industry. ICMC auditing protocols are exacting, detailed, and transparent, and third party auditors are held to a very high standard with respect to their independence, auditing capabilities, and technical experience.\\" The Mining Certification Evaluation Project's final report concluded that \\"third party certification schemes offer a credible means with which to assess and verify performance against agreed standards\\", and noted that \\"the Cyanide Code is a prominent example of an existing third-party certification scheme for the mining industry.\\" In an article in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum May, 2015 magazine Kinross Gold Corporation's Vice President of Environmental Affairs, Dean Williams, concurred saying that the Cyanide Code has become the new industry standard. “Any responsible gold miner of any size that elects not to become certified is actually making a statement that is contrary to most of the industry.\\" Australian regulators have credited reductions by the Australian gold mining industry in the incidence of environmental impacts, regulatory non-compliance and community resistance by complying with the Cyanide Code. It has been observed that globally there have been no major environmental incidents at a gold mining operation certified as compliant with the Cyanide Code. The Responsible Jewellery Council, an international standards setting and certification organization for the jewelry supply chain, requires its gold mining members to have applicable sites certified in compliance to the Cyanide Code. The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) is developing a system of best practice standards aimed at improving mining operations' social and environmental performance, with a goal of certifying mine sites in 2015. In developing its system, IRMA is building on the work of other initiatives including the Cyanide Code. By adopting standards and practices that exceed state-imposed regulations and laws, the mining industry and financing institutions, provide an additional source of protection for indigenous and local communities. As a result, their institutional policies may strengthen the ability of developing nations to demand higher standards which would benefit these communities. Support for industry codes, such as the International Cyanide Management Code, could relieve some pressure on developing nations to maintain lower standards to attract foreign investment, according to Christine R. Thompson, writing in the Suffolk Transnational Law Review. \\"The Code's Principles and Standards of Practice would apply regardless of the state's regulatory environment. The Code's third-party audits guarantee uniform compliance, an aspect lacking in other voluntary measures such as the U.N. Global Compact. Wide adoption of voluntary standards might make them binding and applicable to all, regardless of whether state regulations are less stringent or protective.\\" The Cyanide Code also has been endorsed by the Chief Inspector of Mines in South Africa. The government of Zimbabwe, like other countries, recommends that mines using cyanide in their operation do so consistent with the Cyanide Code's requirements. The United National Environment Programme (UNEP) has described ICMI as a partner in its efforts to promote emergency preparedness. In UNEP's 2012 publication \\"Commemorating 25 Years of Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at Local Level (APELL),\\" it stated that the Cyanide Code is \\"consistent with the APELL framework and its ten-step process.\\" The China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters,’ a national industry association officially affiliated with China’s Ministry of Commerce, released their first industry specific guidance on social responsibility for China’s mining industry. Their “Guidelines for Social Responsibility in Outbound Mining Investment” requires Chinese mining companies to include social and environmental factors into their management plans for overseas operations, and specifically encourages that mining operations using cyanide be certified in compliance with the Cyanide Code. According to a leading expert on wildlife interaction with gold mine tailings, “Since the inception of the International Cyanide Management Code … the issue of wildlife deaths at operations compliant with the Code has been largely resolved; however, according to available information the wildlife death rate remains unabated at operations that are not signatories to the Code.” References External links *International Cyanide Management Code *Earthworks Category:2002 introductions Category:Cyanides Category:Environmental standards Category:Gold mining Category:Self-regulatory organizations ","title":"International Cyanide Management Code"},{"id":"32993928","text":"The Pilgrim and the Stars is an album by Italian jazz trumpeter and composer Enrico Rava recorded in 1975 and released on the ECM label.ECM discography accessed September 6, 2011 Reception The Allmusic review by Matt Collar awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"Enrico Rava's debut for ECM, 1975's The Pilgrim and the Stars, is a stellar progressive jazz effort from the Italian trumpeter who was then just coming into his own...

NCHL pursues this mission through a combination of research, thought leader convening, facilitation of inter- organizational collaboratives, and dissemination of findings through white papers and videos from its annual events. History NCHL was founded in 2001, as the result of a national summit on healthcare leadership funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which identified a need for greater emphasis within the health sector on adopting organizationally-based leadership development practices. During its early years, NCHL supported an Advanced Leadership Development Program for healthcare executives, and developed the validated National Health Leadership Competency Model. in collaboration with the Hay Group. NCHL also established an invitational symposium and national leadership award dinner, which is held every November in Chicago. In the mid-2000s NCHL, in collaboration with the accrediting body ACEHSA, supported the evolution of graduate healthcare management education from a knowledge-based to a competency-based approach. By 2007, competency- based education had become an established part of the accreditation process, and was expanded further in the 2013 revision of the accrediting guidelines. In Spring of 2011, NCHL developed a joint operating agreement with Rush University Medical Center and the Griffith Leadership Center of the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The agreement was pursued in recognition of changing healthcare leadership development needs associated with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2013, NCHL's programs were expanded to include the US Cooperative for International Patient Programs, an organizational membership program with a mission to expand global access to US expertise in high-quality healthcare. In 2014, NCHL established a coordinated improvement effort for administrative fellowships, the National Council for Administrative Fellowships. Members include hospitals and health systems that sponsor these post-graduate fellowships, as well as accredited graduate health management programs with a focus on preparing students for careers in the profession of health management. Current activity The programs of NCHL are supported primarily through dues contributed by organizational members. Participants in NCHL programs, called Councils, vary based on the specific program, but generally involve leaders who are responsible a specific leadership activity within their own health system or university. Participants identify and prioritize areas in which support from NCHL can help pursue improvements collaboratively. In addition to Councils, NCHL maintains a validated interprofessional health leadership competency model, which is made available to the field via their website. NCHL also operates an awards program that recognizes health systems for their use of evidence-based practices in leadership development. The survey used by the program receives updates based on emerging research on the science of leadership development. Data generated by survey takers has been used to assess relationships between leadership development practices and specific health system outcomes such as financial performance and patient experience.

He was killed in a purge of high-level Tang officials by the warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who was then preparing to seize the throne.  Background  It is not known when Wang Pu was born. His family was part of the Wang clan of Taiyuan and claimed original ancestry from King Ling of Zhou. Wang Pu's traceable ancestry included officials of Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. Wang Pu's grandfather Wang Kan (王堪) was a county magistrate, but his father Wang Cong (王聰) was not listed with any offices.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. His biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that his own geographic origin had been lost to history.New Book of Tang, vol. 182.  Early career  After Wang Pu passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (進士) class, he entered governmental service and eventually became Libu Yuanwailang (禮部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Libu), as well as an editor of the imperial histories. In 896, when the chancellor Cui Yin was commissioned as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern Changsha), Henan,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Cui invited Wang to serve on his staff as his secretary in his role as governor (觀察使, Guanchashi). After Cui's commission was cancelled shortly after and he was allowed to remain as chancellor due to the intercession of his ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Wuanwu Circuit, Wang also remained at the imperial government, becoming a scholar at Jianxian Hall (集賢殿). Thereafter, at the request of Zhao Guangfeng the deputy chief imperial censor, Wang was made Xingbu Langzhong (刑部郎中), a supervisory official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu), but was also put in charge of the general affairs of the office of censors (御史臺, Yushi Tai). When Emperor Zhaozong was deposed by a group of powerful eunuchs — Liu Jishu and Wang Zhongxian (王仲先) the commanders of the Shence Armies and the directors of palace communications Wang Yanfan (王彥範) and Xue Qiwo (薛齊偓) — in late 900, in favor of his son Li Yu, Prince of De the Crown Prince, Cui persuaded a group of Shence Army officers to carry out a countercoup in spring 901 to restore Emperor Zhaozong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Wang Pu was involved in Cui's persuasion of the Shence Army officers as well, and soon thereafter was made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) and deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang).  Chancellorship  Shortly after Wang Pu's commission as imperial scholar and deputy minister of census, he was further made Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), and a chancellor, with the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), apparently at Cui Yin's recommendation. He was also made the director of taxation (判戶部, Pan Hubu). It was said that there was not much that he could do to improve the imperial governance, however. In late 901, believing that Emperor Zhaozong and Cui were planning a general slaughter of the eunuchs, the eunuchs, now led by Han Quanhui, seized control of Emperor Zhaozong and took him to Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then ruled by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen. Most imperial officials, led by Cui, stayed at the imperial capital Chang'an, and subsequently, as Zhu Quanzhong, whom Cui had summoned to try to combat the eunuchs, was approaching Chang'an, Cui sent Wang to Chishui (赤水, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), to rendezvous with Zhu and to discuss the next step in the campaign.  Removal and death  By 903, Zhu Quanzhong had defeated Li Maozhen and forced Li Maozhen to surrender Emperor Zhaozong to sue for peace, and Emperor Zhaozong returned to Chang'an. By this point, Cui Yin had become the most powerful official at the imperial court. It was said that it was Cui's instigation that, shortly after the emperor's return to Chang'an, that Wang Pu was demoted to by Taizi Binke (太子賓客)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. — an advisor to the Crown Prince, but a completely honorary position at that time since there was no crown prince (Li Yu's having been removed from that title after the 901 countercoup) — and sent out of Chang'an to have his office at the eastern capital Luoyang. (Also at Cui's instigation, two chancellors that Emperor Zhaozong had commissioned at Fengxiang, while under Li Maozhen's and the eunuchs' control, Su Jian and Lu Guangqi, were forced to commit suicide.) Wang was later recalled to the imperial government to serve as the minister of worship (太常卿, Taichang Qing) and minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu). After Zhu, who was then intent on seizing the throne, assassinated Emperor Zhaozong in 904 and replaced him with his son Emperor Ai, in 905, Zhu, at the advice of his close associates Liu Can and Li Zhen, began demoting and killing Tang aristocrats en masse. Wang was first demoted to be the census officer at Zi Prefecture (淄州, in modern Zibo, Shandong), and then ordered to commit suicide at Baima Station (白馬驛, in modern Anyang, Henan), with fellow former chancellors Pei Shu, Dugu Sun, Cui Yuan, Lu Yi, as well as the officials Zhao Chong (趙崇) and Wang Zan (王贊). At Li Zhen's request (as Li Zhen, who was unable to pass the imperial examinations, resented these traditional aristocrats for claiming to be free from taint), Zhu had their bodies thrown into the Yellow River (as Li Zhen put it, to taint them).

The episode introduces Blue Beetle in his first on-screen appearance. Plot The episode opens with Batman and Green Arrow breaking out of Clock King's clockwork death trap clock that would have lowered them into acid, before going on to fight him and his henchmen. The main plot starts after the theme song airs. Teenage Jaime Reyes has become the second Blue Beetle but is not convinced that he has what it takes to be a superhero, partially because he has a few problems with controlling his powers, such as when he tried to rescue a cat from a tree. Batman decides to take the young superhero under his wing and asks Blue Beetle to help him stop a meteor. The mission is stopped, however, when Blue Beetle's scarab creates a wormhole which sends the two superheroes to a distant planet. The planet is inhabited by intelligent single-celled aliens called Gibbles that are under constant siege by the intergalactic pirate Kanjar Ro, who wants to harvest their bodies for fuel. The aliens mistakenly believe Blue Beetle is another, alien, scarab-wearing Blue Beetle who is their savior, and who Batman correctly guesses was killed, and think Batman is his sidekick. Blue Beetle is not confident that he can save them, although he decides to try when he sees the hope they have for him. Batman tells the Blue Beetle to give a speech to the aliens to encourage them to help him and Batman fight Kanjar Ro. Kanjar Ro is meanwhile draining energy from the Gibbles to power his ships for raids on the Medra Quadrant. However, Batman, Blue Beetle and the Gibble army attacks and Blue Beetle starts getting the hang of controlling the suit. He saves Batman from Kanjar Ro, then fights and defeats him, but Ro returns, freeing his crew and using his Gamma Gong on Blue Beetle, which he knows that he has a weakness for; its sonic waves eliminates his suit, and was how he killed the last Blue Beetle. Batman is incapacitated, and another blow of the Gong completely strips Blue Beetle's armor away; when Ro sees his greatest foe is a child, he realizes he did eliminate the Beetle the last time they fought. After the Gibble army is soon after defeated, Ro has Batman and some Gibbles tied to a satellite floating in a part of space with fish-like space monsters that come to eat them, but Batman plugs one of the satellite's cables into the body of the Gibble next to him, charging it with power to electrocute one of the monsters and scare the other monsters away. Meanwhile, Ro has tied up Blue Beetle and is now using the Gong to find the right frequency to remove the Scarab. As Batman enters and Ro is knocked into the Gong, the scarab is removed by the created tones. Ro attaches it to his spine and uses its power to fight Batman. Meanwhile, Jaime thinks creatively and escapes his bonds, and before Ro can kill Batman, he arrives with the Gong and uses it to strip away the armor and remove the Scarab from Ro. Enraged, he tries to attack them, but the Gibble from before arrives and uses a newly made weapon that utilizes the power from its body to knock Ro out. Before he and Blue Beetle leave their planet, the Gibbles thank Batman for his part in helping Blue Beetle and themselves to defeat Kanjor Ro. Returning to Earth through the wormhole, they find it has brought them back to not only the exact place, but also the exact time after they had gone through it the first time. This gives them enough time to finish the mission to stop the meteor that got them sent through the wormhole in the first place, and after making sure his partner is ready, Batman and Blue Beetle take on the meteor. Production Michael Jelenic, the story editor and co-producer of the show, wrote the scene with Jaime and his friend Paco, commented on Batman and Green Arrow on television because that is the type of thing that he imagined fanboys arguing about. The Clock King segment includes pop culture references while Jaime's room has a The Dark Knight Returns poster. The episode has easter eggs of characters that didn't appear in the episode. Reception Dan Phillips of IGN said that people would not like The Rise of the Blue Beetle! very much if they have a problem with \\"wormholes, single-cell organisms and evil intergalactic pirates being mentioned in the same breath as Batman\\". Scott Summers of Toonzone liked the plot of the episode while also noting that there are references to older Batman animation. Rob M. Worley of Mania said that the episode has \\"laugh-out- loud moments\\" and praised the action and plot twists.

Of the three general approaches to laparoscopic access, the Veress needle technique is the oldest and most traditional. History The tool was first developed in 1932 by János Veres(s) (1903–1979), a Hungarian internist working with tuberculosis patients. At the time, one of the mainstays of treatment was to collapse an infected lung and allow lesions to heal. The needle was introduced as a safer technique to give patients such pneumothoraces. It was not until 1938, when he published his invention in the German literature, that the needle became more broadly known outside of Hungary. Raoul Palmer introduced the use of the Veress needle in laparoscopy to establish a pneumoperitoneum. Description Modern needles are 12 to 15 cm long, with an external diameter of 2 mm. The outer cannula consists of a beveled needle point for cutting through tissues of the abdominal wall. A spring-loaded, inner stylet is positioned within the outer cannula. This inner stylet has a dull tip to protect any viscera from injury by the sharp, outer cannula. Direct pressure on the tip—as when penetrating through tissue—pushes the dull stylet into the shaft of the outer cannula. When the tip of the needle enters a space such as the peritoneal cavity, the dull, inner stylet springs forward. Carbon dioxide is then passed through the Veress needle to inflate the space, creating a pneumoperitoneum.Gould JC, Philip A. Principles and Techniques of Abdominal Access and Physiology of Pneumoperitoneum. In: Ashley SW. Scientific American Surgery. Decker Intellectual Properties; 2011. Use In a large survey of 155,987 gynecologic procedures and 17,216 general surgery procedures, the Veress needle technique was used in 78% of them. Gynecologists (81%) used the tool more often than general surgeons (48%) who are far more likely to use the open access technique. Iatrogenics In different studies, it has been pointed out that for different laparoscopic surgery applications (such as cholecystectomy, groin hernia repairs and appendectomies) creating pneumoperitoneum by using a Veress needle is not always as safe and effective as other techniques (e.g. direct trocar insertion (DTI)). However, some other prospective studies point out that there is no significant difference between the technique chosen and incidence of complications by inducing pneumoperitoneum using a Veress needle or the Hasson technique. Between the complications associated to this instrument it can be found: * Injury to hollow viscous * Bleeding * Failure to achieve pneumoperitoneum * Prepneumoperitoneum * Biloma due to liver puncture. * Vascular injury See also *Laparoscopic surgery *Trocar  References  Category:Medical equipment ","title":"Veress needle"},{"id":"32994424","text":"Gary Gudgeon is an Australian Paralympic swimmer.

Her father sent her to live in the Emperor Ichijō's harem at age 12. Because of his power, influence and political machinations she quickly achieved the status of . As empress she was able to surround herself with a court of talented and educated ladies-in-waiting such as Murasaki Shikibu, author of The Tale of Genji. By the age of 20, she bore two sons to Ichijō, both of whom went on to become emperors and secured the status of the Fujiwara line. In her late 30s she took vows as a Buddhist nun, renouncing imperial duties and titles, assuming the title of Imperial Lady. She continued to be an influential member of the imperial family until her death at age 86.  Empress  In the middle of the 9th century Fujiwara no Yoshifusa declared himself regent to Emperor Seiwa—his young grandson—the Fujiwara clan dominated court politics until the end of the 11th century, through strategic marriages of Fujiwara daughters into the imperial family and the use of regencies. Fujiwara no Michinaga had four daughters he arranged to marry to emperors.Henshall (1999), 24–25 At this period emperors held little power, holding a nominal position for rituals, and often too young to make decisions. In their stead, the top position in the power structure was held by a regent, with power often measured by the how closely the regent was tied by family relationships to an emperor.Bowring (2005), xiv In 995 Michinaga's two brothers Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane died in rapid succession, leaving the regency vacant; Michinaga won a power struggle against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika, brother to Emperor Ichijō's wife Teishi, aided by his sister Senshi (mother to Emperor Ichijō, Emperor En'yū's wife). Because Teishi supported Korechika—later discredited and banished from court—her base of power disintegrated. Four years later Michinaga sent Shōshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichijō's harem when she was about 12.McCullough (1990), 201Bowring believes she was 10 years old when she was sent to court. See Bowring (2005), xiv A year after placing Shōshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi's influence and increase Shōshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian Donald Shively explains, \\"Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Shōshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of \\"Lustrous Heir-bearer\\" kōgō and Shōshi that of \\"Inner Palatine\\" (chūgū), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion\\". She went on to hold the title(s) of Empress Dowager (Kōtaigō) and Grand Empress Dowager (Taikōtaigō).  Ladies-in-waiting  Murasaki Shikibu, shown here in a late-16th-century illustration by Tosa Mitsuoki, joined Shōshi's court in c. 1005. To give Shōshi prestige and to make her competitive in a court that valued education and learning, Michinaga sought talented, educated and interesting ladies-in-waiting to build a salon to rival that of Teishi and Seishi (daughter of Emperor Murakami). Michinaga invited Murasaki Shikibu, author of The Tale of Genji, to Shōshi's court, where she joined Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon. At Teishi's court as lady-in-waiting was writer Sei Shōnagon, author of The Pillow Book. The women at the two empresses' courts wrote some of the best-known and enduring Heian era literature.Shirane (1987), 58Mulhern (1994), 156 Although she lived in the Imperial palace, Shōshi's main residence for was in one or another of her father's many mansions, particularly after the Imperial palace burned down in 1005.Bowring (2005), xxiv Shōshi was about 16 when Murasaki joined her court, probably to teach her Chinese. Japanese literature scholar Arthur Waley describes Shōshi as a serious young lady based on a passage from Murasaki who wrote in her diary: \\"As the years go by Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness, and is shunned by all who can manage to avoid it\\".Waley (1960), viii Moreover, Murasaki describes advice Shōshi gave to her ladies-in- waiting to avoid appearing too flirtatious: > Her Majesty does indeed still constantly warn us that it is a great mistake > to go too far, 'for a single slip may bring very unpleasant consequences,' > and so on, in the old style; but she now also begs us not to reject advances > in such a way as to hurt people's feelings. Unfortunately, habits of long > standing are not so easily changed; moreover, now that the Empress's > exceedingly stylish brothers bring so many of their young courtier-friends > to amuse themselves at her house, we have in self-defence been obliged to > become more virtuous than ever'.  Mother to two emperors  Shōshi gave Ichijō two sons, in 1008 and 1009. The births are described in detail in Murasaki's The Diary of Lady Murasaki. The boys were born at their grandfather's Tsuchimikado mansion, with Buddhist priests in attendance.Mulhern, (1991), 86 With her second son Atsuhira, Shōshi had a difficult birth; to appease evil spirits she underwent a ritual head shaving, although only a lock of hair was cut.Groner (2002), 281 This ritual was considered to have been a minor ordination, or jukai into Buddhism, for the purpose of receiving divine protection when her life, and that of her unborn infant, was at risk. Ritual ceremonies were followed on specific days after the births. As was customary, Michinaga's first visit to Shōshi took the form of a lavish ritual 16 days after she gave birth. In her diary, Murasaki described the clothing of one woman in attendance, \\"Her mantle had five cuffs of white lined with dark red, and her crimson gown was of beaten silk\\".qtd in Mulhern, (1991), 87 On the 50th day after the birth a ceremony was held in which the infant was offered a piece of mochi; Michinaga performed the ritual offering of the rice cake to his grandson Atsuhira. In her diary Murasaki described the event that she probably attended.\\"Detached segment of the diary of Lady Murasaki emaki\\". National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties of National Museums, Japan. National Institutes of Cultural Heritage. Retrieved September 10, 2011. Michinaga's influence meant that Shōshi's two sons had a better chance of ascending the throne than Teishi's children—particularly after Teishi's death in 1001. When Ichijō abdicated in 1011 and died soon after,Adolphson (2007), 31 Shōshi's eldest son, the future Emperor Go-Ichijō, was named crown prince.Shively and McCullough (1999), 67–69 At that time Shōshi retired from the Imperial Palace to live in a Fujiwara mansion in the Lake Biwa region, most likely accompanied by Murasaki.Shirane (1987), 221 In 1016 when Michinaga had Emperor Sanjō—married to Shōshi's younger sister Kenshi—removed from the throne, Go-Ichijō became emperor. Shōshi's second son, Go-Suzaku, became crown prince in 1017. With an emperor and a crown prince as sons, Shōshi's position was secure and she became a powerful influence at court. For many years Shōshi's power extended to selecting friends and relatives to fill court positions and to approving consorts—decisions that affected the imperial court. The consorts she selected were her father's direct descendants, thus she asserted control of her father's lineage for many years.  Imperial Lady  Shoshi likely lived in the Lake Biwa region, shown here in a late-17th-century illustration by Tosa Mitsuoki, after retiring from court. It was not uncommon for Heian aristocratic women to take religious vows, become nyūdō, and yet remain in secular life. As her father and her aunt Seishi had done before her, at 39 in 1026, Shōshi underwent an ordination ceremony to become a Buddhist nun. This was done at a lavish ceremony, at a place decorated with gold-leafed illustrated folding screens, priceless gifts were displayed, and courtiers, dressed in sumptuous costumes, were in attendance. The ritual was performed by five priests, three representing the most senior hierarchy of the Buddhist priesthood, one of whom was Shōshi's cousin who performed the hair-cutting ceremony, in which her long hair was cut shoulder-length, called amasogi style. At this time she assumed the name Jōtōmon-in. This, her second jukai, symbolized a transition from Empress to Imperial Lady, a change of lifestyle, and marked her as a novice nun. However, research suggests that political power was gained rather than lost when becoming Imperial Ladies, despite relinquishing imperial duties and devoting themselves to Buddhist rites. As was the custom for noblewomen of her period, Shōshi took ordination rites in steps; much later in life, in yet another ritual, she received full vows and at that time underwent a full shaving of her head.Meeks, 52–57 The first two empresses to take title of Imperial Lady were Seishi, later followed by Shōshi. With the title came a new residence and permission to hire men for the household. Shōshi's role as Imperial Lady, as documented in the Eiga Monogatari, was studied and emulated by imperial women who were to follow her as Imperial Ladies.Meeks, 58 She died in 1074 aged 86.

It was elevated in 1850, and equipped with a copper cupola and a new light. In the 1870s, Dutch lighthouse designer Quirinus Harder got the assignment for a new lighthouse. The lighthouse is made of cast iron and consists of nine segments. At the foot of the tower is one house for the supervisor and four more for the lighthouse keeper. The original light rotated in a mercury bath, which was replaced in the 1960s by an electrical system.

The hall was built to serve the cultural and educational needs of the Czech immigrant community, and currently serves as host to Sokol Greater Cleveland and the Cleveland Czech Cultural Center and Museum. Building history Over the years, the building's exterior darkened appreciably due to the pollution from nearby steel mills. Sokol, a local Czech American society which promotes athletics and healthy living, purchased the building for $35,000 ($ in dollars) in 1975. Bohemian National Hall underwent a $400,000 ($ in dollars) renovation in 1997. The basement was deepened by to raise the ceiling to a more customary height. In the first floor lobby, paint was stripped from the quarter-sawn oak molding and panelling and a false wall removed to reveal a wrought iron screen. The walls of the grand ballroom on the second floor were cleaned of more than a century of grime, and two ornate hand-carved columns were rescued and placed in the third-floor museum. An elevator was also added to the structure, to make the fourth floor gymnasium more accessible. In 1998, Sokol began construction on a $1.5 million ($ in dollars), addition to the Bohemian National Hall. Built by Panzica Construction, the volleyball court (which shared the ballroom) and the gymnastics practice area (on the fourth floor) moved to the addition once it was finished.

Definition The transmitter is constantly issuing high power RF with continuous wave radar. Some of the transmit signal will leak into the receiver when the receive antenna is near the transmit antenna. The signal that leaks from the transmitter to the receiver is called bleed-through. Electronic circuits have limited dynamic range, and this reduces receiver sensitivity. Feed-through nulling significantly reduces the bleed-through signal, which can be used to increase receiver sensitivity in continuous wave radar. Operation There are two kinds of feed-through nuller. * Active * Passive =Active= A sample of the transmit signal is fed to an attenuator. The feed-through nuller samples the bleed-through signal arriving at the receiver. This bleed-through sample is amplified, filtered (low-pass), and this is used to drive the attenuator. Attenuator output is phase shifted 180 degrees added to the receive signal. This cancels the bleed-through signal. Total gain determines the amount of cancellation. =Passive= A passive feed-through nuller uses a band-stop filter to reduce low-frequency signals before digital signal sampling, and this includes the bleed-through signal. The band-pass filter used with a microwave receiver is typically 1 MHz. The band-stop filter used as a feed- through nuller is typically 1kHz, which attenuates signals in the center of the band-pass filter. The band-stop filter is generally wide enough to reduce clutter, in addition to the bleed-through signal. Passive feed-through nulling is not used with CW radar altimeters because this eliminates the ground-bounce signal.

The first Doggie Diner was opened on Oakland's San Pablo Avenue in 1948 and grew in popularity. At one time there were 30 locations around the San Francisco Bay Area, mostly concentrated in San Francisco.

After the Doggie Diner went out of business, all the large dog head signs were taken down and many were resold to private parties. In 2001, one of the dog signs, restored and refurbished by the city of San Francisco, was installed on a median strip at Sloat Boulevard and 45th Avenue, near San Francisco's Ocean Beach and the San Francisco Zoo in the Outer Sunset neighborhood.

Zippy frequently participated in his long-running conversation with the giant fiberglass doggie mascot. In 2004, Laughing Squid, a website founded in San Francisco, sponsored three of the dog heads – named Manny, Moe & Jack – as the \\"Holy Dogminican Order\\" to take the dog heads on a cross-country trip, ending in a show by Cyclecide at CBGB in New York City.

It was part of a successful French offensive designed to capture strategic positions in the Maritime Alps and Ligurian Alps, and on the Mediterranean coast. Tactical control of the battle was exercised by André Masséna for the French and Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi for the Coalition. Saorge is located in France, about northeast of Nice. At the time of the battle, the town was named Saorgio and belonged to Piedmont. Since September 1792, the Piedmontese defenses around Saorge had resisted capture. In early April 1794, the French struck northeastward along the Italian Riviera, quickly seizing the small port of Oneglia. From there, Masséna struck north to capture two towns in the upper Tanaro valley before turning west to outflank the positions around Saorge. After some fighting, the Austro- Piedmontese withdrew to the north side of the Col de Tende (Tenda Pass) which the French occupied. Dumerbion's troops also seized a large portion of the Italian Riviera. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The engagement is significant in military history because a newly appointed artillery general by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte drew up the plans for the offensive. Background The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont stood at a disadvantage in a war with France because two of its territories lay on the French side of the Alps. These lands were the County of Nice on the Mediterranean coast and the Duchy of Savoy in the north. Aware of his awkward situation, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia attempted to secure an alliance with Habsburg Austria at the same time as he held diplomatic talks with the French.Boycott-Brown, 73-74 In spring 1792, war broke out between the French First Republic and Sardinia. The French government ordered General Anne-Pierre, marquis de Montesquiou-Fézensac to invade Savoy on 15 May, but that officer decided that he needed more time to prepare. During the summer, King Victor Amadeus frantically haggled with Austria to get military assistance. On 22 September, Austria finally agreed to provide an Auxiliary Corps of 8,000 troops under Feldmarschallleutnant Leopoldo Lorenzo Count of Strassoldo. However, the Convention of Milan came too late.Boycott-Brown, 74-75 King Victor Amadeus III On 21 September 1792, Montesquiou invaded Savoy and resistance collapsed. The general reported to his government that the people welcomed his army.Durant & Durant, 49 The town of Chambéry was occupied on 24 September. Sardinian General Lazary, a 70-year- old relic, proved unable to mount an effective defense.Boycott-Brown, 75 A second French force captured Nice without bloodshed on 27 September and went on to seize Villefranche-sur-Mer two days later. At the behest of its leaders, Savoy was incorporated into France on 27 November. On 23 September, a French naval squadron under Rear Admiral Laurent Jean François Truguet sailed to the Piedmontese port of Oneglia where an 800-man battalion disembarked. The troops sacked the town and murdered some monks before taking to their ships again.Smith, 27 On 18 November 1792, the Sardinians repulsed their adversaries at Sospel (Sospello). The French retreated to L'Escarène and went into winter quarters.Smith, 33 Dismayed by the incapacity of his generals, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia begged the Austrians to send a commander to direct the combined Austrian and Piedmontese armies. The Austrian government appointed Feldzeugmeister Joseph Nikolaus De Vins to fill the post on 21 December 1792. Even so, Austria was aware that the French were trying to negotiate a peace with the Sardinians, and the Austrians did not fully trust their ally. The execution of King Louis XVI of France on 21 January 1793 appalled the other crowned heads of Europe and further isolated France. Duke of Biron On 28 February 1793, 12,000 French troops under Lieutenant General Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duke of Biron battled with 7,000 Sardinian soldiers under Charles- François Thaon, Count of Saint-André at Levens. In this French success, each side lost 800 casualties. In addition, the French captured two of their enemy's six cannons.Smith, 42 The Sardinian army held a powerful defensive position at Saorge (Saorgio), blocking access to the strategically important Col de Tende (Tenda Pass).Boycott-Brown, 75-76 On 8 June 1793, the Army of Italy under General of Division Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet won a minor victory over the Sardinians in the area of L'Aution Peak west of Saorge. The forces clashed again in the First Battle of Saorgio on 12 June. This time the French were defeated. The Sardinian units involved in these fights were two battalions each of the Cacciatori and Swiss Christ Infantry Regiments, one battalion each of the Saluzzo, Sardinia, and Lombardy Infantry Regiments. Also engaged were two companies of French volunteers, the Cacciatori de Canale, Light Infantry, 1st, 3rd, and 5th Grenadier Battalions, and the Vercelli, Casale, and Acqui Provincial Regiments.Smith, 47-48 The attack was \\"ill- conceived\\" and ended in \\"disaster\\".Boycott-Brown, 77 Fighting occurred at Utelle on 21 October 1793. The allies tried to mount a counteroffensive, but this effort was crippled by the new commander's slowness. De Vins planned to recapture both Savoy and Nice, which a number of officers objected to. Because he suffered badly from gout, De Vins planned to control both offensives from the capital of Turin. The Duke of Montferrat, who led the counter-invasion of Savoy, was to follow strict daily orders from De Vins. Since Turin was distant, the arrangements were impractical.Boycott-Brown, 77-78 In the event, a French force under General of Division François Christophe de Kellermann repulsed Lieutenant General Cordon's Savoy column at the Battle of Epierre on 15 September 1793. The French suffered 500 casualties out of 8,000 troops, while the Sardinians lost 1,000 men out of 6,000 engaged.Smith, 56 The Count of Saint-André was directed to advance on Nice from Saorgio. This effort was made difficult by tension between Saint-André and his Austrian subordinate Feldmarschallleutnant Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi. Meanwhile, De Vins' chief of staff, Eugène-Guillaume Argenteau managed to get himself on bad terms with most of the Piedmontese officer corps. At this time, portions of southern France rebelled against the revolutionary government. Large French republican forces had to be sent to suppress the revolt at the Siege of Toulon, giving Piedmont a chance to recover its lost territory. King Victor Amadeus and De Vins left the capital in August to oversee the southern front where they planned to start operations on 7 September.Boycott-Brown, 78 On 18 October, six Piedmontese battalions of the Aosta, Guardia, and Piedmont Infantry Regiments defeated the French at Gilette. Three days later there was an inconclusive skirmish at Utelle involving the 5th Grenadiers.Smith, 59-60 The offensive ended when heavy snow fell in the mountains, forcing the king to give up the campaign and return to his capital in November.Boycott-Brown, 80 Battle This map shows the Battle of Saorgio campaign in April 1794. The progress of the French offensive is displayed with flags and dates where known. While Dumerbion's main army probed at the Coalition lines, Masséna's wing launched a wide right hook that outflanked the enemy defenses. At the start of 1794, the Piedmontese occupied a formidable defensive position that ran from Roquebillière on the west through the Col de Raus, L'Aution Peak, and Colle Basse to Saorge. From Saorge, the line ran northeast to Cima di Marte, Col Argente, and Monte Saccarello. The line was so strong that an outflanking move to the east seemed the obvious move. Sardinian General Dellera feared that the French might seize the Colle di Nava northwest of Oneglia. He wanted to occupy Briga Alta northeast of Saorgio but De Vins refused to authorize it. However, Dellera convinced the army commander to move an Austrian force from the Po River valley to Dego. In addition, De Vins ordered 4,000 Sardinian troops to protect the area around Oneglia.Boycott-Brown, 88-89 French General Pierre Jadart Dumerbion commanded the Army of Italy. Competent but old, he had seen too many generals sent to the guillotine for failing or for having the wrong political views.Chandler, 30 Two of his predecessors suffered this fate, Brunet on 15 November 1793Broughton, Gaspard Brunet and Biron on 31 December 1793.Broughton, Biron In order to stay out of trouble, Dumerbion determined to consult the all-powerful Representatives on mission before acting. At this time, the representatives were Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti and both were influenced by freshly-promoted General of Brigade Napoleon Bonaparte, the army's new artillery chief. Bonaparte drew up a strategic plan and Dumerbion listened. Bonaparte planned to launch a drive northeast along the coast to capture Oneglia, a nest of Sardinian privateers that preyed on the Genoa-to-Nice grain trade. From Oneglia, the French would turn north to seize Ormea, outflanking the enemy's defenses from the east. While these moves were implemented, the main army would distract the Coalition defenders by advancing directly on Saorge. Of Dumerbion's 43,000-man field army, 20,000 men formed the attacking force, divided into three columns and a reserve.Chandler, 31 Town of La Brigue On 6 April 1794, Dumerbion opened the offensive. Crossing neutral territory belonging to the Republic of Genoa, the French seized the port of Oneglia on the 9th. Argenteau, who commanded the local Piedmontese division, occupied Ormea and strung out his 10 battalions in an attempt to link the Saorge defenses in the west with Dego in the east. The French advance, led by General of Division André Masséna, brushed aside Argenteau's men and captured Ormea around 17 April and Garessio on the 19th. Colli, the newly appointed commander at Saorge, now found that his position was outflanked.Boycott-Brown, 90 De Vins advised Colli to hold the position but to send back any forces not needed for immediate defense. Relations between the allies were so bad at this time that some Piedmontese officers believed that De Vins was plotting to betray them. On the French side, Auguste Marmont claimed that the ailing Dumerbion stayed in Nice during the entire operation.Boycott-Brown, 91 On 24 April there was a clash at Saorge, as the French main army advanced north. Colli's defenders included three battalions of the Alvinczi Infantry Regiment Nr. 19, the 3rd Battalion of the Strassoldo Infantry Regiment Nr. 27, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Archduke Anton Infantry Regiment Nr. 52, and the 2nd and 9th Battalions of the Karlstadt Grenz infantry regiment. On the same day, Masséna successfully attacked the Col Argente with General of Brigade Amédée Emmanuel François Laharpe's division.Smith, 74 On 27 April, the French seized La Brigue, inflicting heavy losses on the Sardinians. These belonged to the Cacciatori, Guardia, and Tortona Infantry Regiments, the 1st Grenadier Battalion, two companies of French volunteers, and the Cacciatori di Pandini company.Smith, 75 Results The French seized Saorgio on 28 April after Colli withdrew. He abandoned the Col de Tende and retreated to Limone Piemonte, just north of the pass. In early May, Colli fell back to Borgo San Dalmazzo near the fortress of Cuneo. On the coast, the French advanced to seize Albenga and Loano. General of Division François Macquard occupied the Col de Tende, while farther east Masséna deployed his troops to hold the ridges between Ormea and Loano.Boycott-Brown, 92 In the fighting near Saorge, historian Digby Smith stated French losses as 1,500 killed and wounded, while the allied casualties numbered 2,800. Losses for the other battles are not given. Bonaparte and the representatives on mission proposed a new operation to exploit the victory, but it was vetoed by Lazare Carnot. The defeat shocked the Austrians and Sardinians into signing a treaty on 29 May. The Sardinians promised to hold the Alpine passes while the Austrians pledged to defend the coast. The next action in the area was the First Battle of Dego on 21 September 1794.Smith, 92 Notes References * Boycott-Brown, Martin. The Road to Rivoli.

The Triangulated City is a live art event that investigates notions of exchange within the urban environment through the secrets, rumours, messages, myths and memories circulating in a city. Zoukak Theatre Company and Cultural Association hosted Lotos Collective (London/New York) and in collaboration with invited participants, devised the project through a series of participatory workshops. Over three days, in three locations, three performances unfolded simultaneously each evening. The audience navigated the city to visit each of the sites, thus utilising the urban landscape as staging. Utilising a multi-disciplinary approach, each specific site was transformed into a place of artistic encounter, creating an opportunity for workshop participants to develop and expand their artistic interest. The workshops was a place to meet a broad range of creative people and together share, think and expand upon our perceptions of the cityscape. Through our own stories, memories, and urban legends we explored the geographical and geopolitical movement of narrative through the streets of Beirut, illuminating a new relationship and perspective to the urban milieu. Triangulated City encouraged participants and spectators to view the city as an artistic canvas, with each specific location a place of dialogue and encounter.

A United States Environmental Protection Agency researcher dragging for ticks. Method To conduct a tick drag, a researcher uses a strip of white cloth, usually corduroy, mounted on a pole that is tied to a length of rope. The researcher drags the cloth behind him or her through terrain that is suspected of harboring ticks, working in a grid-like pattern. He or she may also \\"flag\\" low-lying bushes and other vegetation by waving the cloth over them. Tick dragging is one of several methods of harvesting wild ticks for study in the lab. In at least one trial, the tick dragging method proved more successful than more technologically innovative techniques, such as live-baited traps and CO2-baited traps. The dragging method is a useful way to collect ticks from a large area; CO2 trapping is another method for localized sampling of ticks. Different species of tick also have variable sensitivity or responsiveness to this form of trapping, so its effectiveness can vary with the species of tick the researcher is interested in sampling. History The practice of dragging a large white cloth across suspected tick-infested terrain is described in biological field guides from the early 20th century. More sophisticated methods have been developed, but the dragging method continues to be practised by researchers today.

The film was based on Hall Caine's play adapted from his novel The Christian which was published in 1897 and the first British novel to sell one million copies. It is considered a lost film. Plot Clergyman John Storm is doing mission work in the slums of London when he meets Glory, a girl from the country, who has been persuaded by Lord Robert Ure to seek a career on the stage. Storm tries to persuade Glory not to do it but she refuses. He then asks Lord Ure, which so infuriates him he sends someone to burn down Storm's mission hall. Storm is unconscious inside but he is rescued at the last minute. He goes to see Glory, determined to save her soul, by killing her if need be. But he comes to his senses and the two of them are married.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p28 Cast *Roy Redgrave as John Storm *Rutland Beckett as Lord Robert Ure *Eugenie Duggan as Glory Quayle *Olive Wilton as Polly Love *Marie D'Alton as Lady Robert Ure *Lily Bryer as Mrs James Callender *Alfred Harford as Lord Storm *Edmund Duggan as Father Enderby *Fred Kehoe as Parson Quayle *Bert Bailey as Archdeacon Wealthy *George Kensington as Brother Paul *Max Clifton as Horatio Drake *Gus Franks as Mr Jupe *Mabs Howth as Liza Production The film is based on a popular play that had been recently been produced in Sydney by William Anderson in September 1911. Roy Redgrave had played the role of John Storm in England for two years prior to coming to Australia. Indoor scenes were shot at Wonderland in Bondi, which was owned by Anderson. Shooting also appears to have taken place at West's studios, which were on top of their headquarters in Pitt Street, Sydney. Roy Redgrave later claimed that he produced the picture: > I had a very strenuous time producing this picture, as I had also to play > John Storm, the while I was telling the members who were acting in the > scenes what to do. All the time I was doing this I thought that when The > Christian was thrown upon the white screen John Storm would be mistaken for > a ventriloquist. It turned out to the satisfaction of all concerned. Redgrave would revive the role on stage throughout the rest of his career. Later Versions There were other film versions of the play in 1914 (from Hollywood), 1915 (from England) and 1923 (from Hollywood).

History Fra Angelico's Pietà The work is perhaps the \\"altarpiece [with] Our Lord's sepulchre [...] and other five figures\\" which appear in the inventory made in 1492 at the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, and which decorated his Villa at Careggi since as early as 1482. The panel was thus one of the works commissioned by the Medici to van der Weyden, including the Medici Madonna now at Städel of Frankfurt, which has been also assigned to the artist's trip to Italy in 1450. Another hypothesis is that the panel was part of a lost triptych painted for Lionello d'Este of Ferrara, and mentioned in 1449, or that it was the painting described by Giorgio Vasari as Hans Memling's. The panel adopts the same scheme in Fra Angelico's Pietà for the predella of the San Marco Altarpiece (1438–1443), now at the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, confirming that the Flemish artist visited Florence during his pilgrimage in Italy of 1449–1450, as mentioned in De viribus illustribus by Bartolomeo Facio (c. 1456). The work was later part of the collections of cardinal Carlo de' Medici, being moved to the Uffizi Gallery in 1666. Filippo Baldinucci described it as a work by Albrecht Dürer. In 1989 it was still assigned to Hans Memling by some scholars, but in 1992 reflex photography showed the underlying drawing, which was clearly executed by van der Weyden. Description The painting has a rectangular shape, and shows Christ being buried with the weeping Mary and John the Evangelist holding his hands. The corpse is supported by Joseph of Arimathea and by Nicodemus dressed in refined clothing of the times and gazing out towards the spectator, once thought to be a self-portrait of the artist which is now known to portray Cosimo the elder. A kneeling Mary Magdalene is depicted in the low foreground. The composition is similar to Angelico's Pietà, but the scene here is more complex and crowded, with less geometrically ordered lines and more anguished faces. The use of oil paint also allowed van der Weyden to obtain deeper colours and a more brilliant light. The attention to details is also typical of the early Netherlandish painting school.

Jews from the Anatolian villages of Suruç and Çermik (named Surucalim and Cermikalim) are also included within the Urfalim definition, due to the geographic proximity among those communities, and due to marriage relations between the three. The community fled Urfa in 1896, eventually relocating to Jerusalem and Tiberias. Writing on Urfalim synagogue in Jerusalem History According to several traditions, Urfa is the Biblical Ur Kaśdim (Ur of the Chaldees, or City of the Chaldees), though most archaeologists establish the location of Ur Kaśdim as being identical with Ur in modern-day Iraq. When Alexander the Great conquered Urfa, he renamed it Ruha. During a significant period of history the city was called in its Greek variation as Edessa. Tradition of the Urfalim tells, the community was quite small, and had grown over 500 years by influx of Mizrahi Jews from Iraq and Aleppo. During the 19th century, the community included about 1,000 people. Religious style The prayer style of the community is missing some prayers, added through the Second Temple Period or after it. Thus, it is assumed, the community predates the Second Temple in Jerusalem (1st century BCE), and had probably resided in Urfa for some 2,500 years, suggesting Urfalim are descendants to the expelled Israelites of the First Temple period. Many of the Urfalim are named Levi (descendants of the Levi tribe). In order to make a distinction between many Levi families, a nickname had been added, such as: \\"Levi Abud\\", \\"Levi Aslan\\", \\"Levi Hamami\\", \\"Levi Urfali\\" etc. Other family names of Urfalim include Ba'sher, Gila (Gil), Yagen, Gazoli and simply Urfali. Migration Most of the Urfalim community migrated to Ottoman Syria in December 1896, fleeing the Hamidian massacres of Armenians, instigated by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The massacres marked the end of the multicultural period, which had characterized Urfa and Anatolia in general for millennia. On their way to the Land of Israel, some Urfalim settled in Aleppo, whereas most moved on, settling in Tiberias (Beirut Vilayet) and mostly Jerusalem (Mutesarrifiyyet of Jerusalem). Some later moved from Jerusalem to Rishon LeZion to work in orchards. In 1947, with the eruption of the Aleppo pogrom, most of the Jews of Aleppo fled the city, relocating to Israel as well. Urfalim today Urfalim synagogue in Jerusalem Cermikalim synagogue in JerusalemA synagogue of the Urfalim community is located in Jerusalem in Bezalel St., and is the only official institution of this community. Right next to it, on the same street, a synagogue of the Cermikalim is located.

It was a low-wing monoplane with a pressurized fuselage, twin piston engines and a tailwheel undercarriage. Development In March 1942 the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service chose Tachikawa Aircraft Company to design and build a new heavy twin engine transport aircraft with a focus on increased range, power and speed to carry light tanks, field artillery and troops. Shinjiro Shinagawa was in charge of the development and began work in March 1943 and had the first prototype completed by September 1944. Like Tachikawa's Ki-77 the aircraft featured a laminar flow airfoil. The Ki-92 also had a sealed cabin with double glazed windows seating 34 troops in 4 rows (including two emergency seats) to reduce the need for oxygen, and forced draught cooling in low drag engine nacelles. Due to various repairs and modifications, the first flight did not occur until April 1945. The test flight recorded a maximum speed of 426 km/h, but the Ki-92 was found to be dangerous to fly with the cargo door open at these speeds even though fuselage rigidity was not a problem. Due to the deteriorating war situation and resulting reduction in priority for transport aircraft, of the three to 10 prototypes planned for, only one prototype and no production aircraft were built before the war ended. Orders included 114 constructed extensively from wood to conserve aluminium, though the Ki-92 prototype already featured a tail made from wood. Tachikawa had planned for their potential use as commercial transports during the design phase. Allied intelligence organizations such as ATAIU SEA were unaware of the existence of the Ki-92 and did not assign a code name to it.

The novel was published by Vanguard Press in 1935. The title refers to someone with material well-being and authority, as poor folk and the powerless wore shoes or went barefoot. The bosses and police feared by the poor and downtrodden wear boots, which not only symbolize their power and relative affluence, but can be used as weapons against them. Plot Cass McKay is a poor illiterate young man set adrift by the Depression. He is a southerner, a \\"Final Descendant of the South\\", one of the \\"wild and hardy tribe that had given Jackson and Lincoln birth... slaveless yeomen who had never cared for slaves or land....\\" Cass lives in the Rio Grande Valley in West Texas in a shack \\"like a casual box on the border; wooden and half-accidental\\" with his father, his brother (a World War I vet disabled by exposure to poison gas during the war), and sister, subsisting on oatmeal or rice and handouts from the \\"Relief Station\\". After a fight between his father and brother, Cass starts drifting, riding the rails from El Paso, Texas to Chicago, with stops in Shreveport, Louisiana and New Orleans. His journey (and the novel) ends in Chicago during the 1933-34 World\`s Fair with the intimation that Cass likely will become a career criminal, already having committed a variety of offenses that have landed him in jail twice. Autobiographical element The novel is based on Algren's own wanderings through America during the Great Depression. Born in Detroit Michigan and raised in Chicago, Algren graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor of Science in journalism in 1931. He began traveling throughout the country and wound up in Texas in 1933, where he wrote his first short story while working at a gas station. Intending to return home, he stole a typewriter from a local business college and was imprisoned for theft. The material in Somebody in Boots would later be reworked into Algren's 1956 novel A Walk on the Wild Side, which also featured a wandering Texan. Algren typically denigrated his first novel, which he felt was a primitive work. In a preface to a 1987 paperback re-issue published by Thunder's Mouth Press, Algren wrote, \`This is an uneven novel written by an uneven man in the most uneven of American times.\`\` Algren earlier had said that he was glad the book had gone out of print as he felt A Walk on the Wild Side was a superior book. Somebody in Boots sold only 750 copies. A byproduct of the book was his relationship with Amanda Kontowicz, whom he met at a publication party for his book. The couple married in 1937, divorced, remarried and eventually were divorced a second and final time. Native Son & Richard Wright Native Son was the original title Algren gave to the novel, but it was changed in accordance with the wishes of his publisher. Algren and Richard Wright had met at Chicago's John Reed Club circa 1933 and later worked together at the Federal Writers' Project in Chicago. According to Bettina Drew's 1989 biography Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side, he bequeathed the title \\"Native Son\\" to Wright.

As a member of the genus Metridium, it is a type of plumose anemone and is found in the seas off north-western Europe and both the east and west coasts of North America.  Description  A view of the interior of a frilled anemone at Maria Mitchell Aquarium on Nantucket; notice the tentacles surrounding the central mouth. The base of Metridium senile is considerably wider than the column and is attached to rock or another substrate. The column is long, smooth and cylindrical, of a fleshy consistency with a slimy surface lubricated with mucus. There are no warts or suckers and the column is topped by a parapet and deep groove. The oral disc is broad and deeply lobed into several curving sections that overhang the column. The slender, pointed tentacles are very numerous in larger specimens though fewer and relatively longer in smaller ones. Those near the margin are crowded and short whereas further into the disc they are longer and more dispersed. The colour range of this sea anemone is large but for any one specimen the colour is uniform throughout, except for the orange-red lip surrounding the central mouth. Colours include, white, cream, pink, orange, red, grey, brown and olive-green. The tentacles are translucent but may have a white band, and some specimens have a darker column and much paler disc.Goose, P., H. (1860). A history of the British sea-anemones and corals. London, Van Voorst. page 12-24.Metridium senile Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-09-05. There are several distinct forms and various intermediate ones. M. senile var. dianthus is described above. It has over 1000 tentacles and exhibits a feathery appearance. It can grow to tall with a base diameter of and a similar tentacle span. M. senile var. pallidus is much smaller, seldom exceeding base diameter, and has a much less convoluted disc with fewer than 200 tentacles. It seems to be a dwarf race, becoming sexually mature while still small.Rawlinson, R., (1934). A comparative study of Metridium senile (L.) var. dianthus (Ellis) and a dwarf variety of this species occurring in the river Mersey, with a discussion on the systematic position of the genus Metridium. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the U.K. 19: 901-919. There are also a number of intermediate forms. Johannes Peter Müller has described the variety dianthus as \\"the most beautiful of all the anemones\\". It is indeed an impressive sight with the tentacles fully expanded, resembling a palm tree, but when retracted it can become a low, irregularly shaped, jelly-like disc of unattractive appearance. When exposed to the air by a retreating tide, it does not always retract but may hang under an overhang in a limp fashion looking like a wet glove with a single drop of water dangling at its tip. Distribution M. senile is found on the northwest coasts of Europe from the Bay of Biscay north to Norway and Iceland. It also occurs on the east and west coasts of North America and has arrived in South African waters.Metridium senile (Linnaeus, 1761) World Register of Marine Species. Retrieved 2018-08-02. It is found on the lower shore and the neritic zone at depths down to about . Habitat M. senile adheres to rocks, boulders, man-made structures, pebbles and shells. It favours places where the current is strong. Smaller forms inhabit the lower shore where they are found under stones, beneath overhangs and in shaded places. It specially favours soft rocks, honeycombed by molluscs, and the underside of large boulders. At greater depths, the larger forms are sometimes abundant on pilings, submerged pipes, pier supports and harbour walls. In the English Channel the anemones are often brought up when trawling in shallow waters for oysters and scallops. One oyster was found to have twenty anemones crowded onto its shell. Biology M. senile is a predator and catches small organisms floating past in the current. Its diet largely consists of copepods, worm larvae, mollusc larvae, ascidian larvae, amphipods and barnacle larvae.Metridium senile Biotic: Biological Traits Information Catalogue. Retrieved 2011-09-05. There are reports of the sea anemone itself being eaten by the sea slug Aeolidia papillosa (\\"shag rug nudibranch\\"), the sea spider, Pycnogonum littorale, wentletrap sea snails Epitonium spp., the flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus and the black bream, Spondyliosoma cantharus. M. senile is a protandric hermaphrodite – it starts life as one sex and changes to the other when it is older. Eggs or sperm develop in the gonads embedded in the mesentery that lines the coelom. They are ejected through the mouth, and when fertilised develop into planula larvae. After one to six months drifting in the plankton, these settle and metamorphose into juveniles. By this means the plume anemone can spread to new areas some way from its origins.Reproduction in the Floating Dock Habitat Retrieved 2011-09-05. The plume anemone can also increase its numbers by asexual reproduction. An individual can undergo binary fission by splitting in half and growing into two organisms. Or it can develop buds which grow into new individuals before becoming detached. Fragmentation, also known as basal laceration, is another mechanism by which the number of individuals can be increased rapidly. In an aquarium, the anemone can sometimes be seen to glide across a hard surface such as the glass wall, leaving fragments behind in the process. After a week or more, each piece can be seen to be developing a disc and tentacles and in due course grows into a new individual. In 1856, in Torbay, England, a waterlogged board was brought to the surface by a dredger. It was found to have over 400 individuals of M. senile of varying sizes living on it.

It is a spin-off of popular 2005 film Udayananu Tharam. Sreenivasan reprises the role of Megastar Saroj Kumar from the original. The director announced that this is not a sequel: Only some characters from Udayananu Tharam were used. The film was shot mainly in Chennai and Kochi. Plot Saroj Kumar is a matinée idol and Megastar in Kerala churning out hits one after the other. But a few of his recent movies, such as Vekkeda Vedi, turns out to be big flops. His new film, directed by Alex Samuel, gets cancelled on the first day of shooting when Saroj slaps fellow actor Shyam for some silly reasons. Pachalam Bhasi, the producer, tries for a compromise, but Saroj is not ready to apologise. Alex Samuel and Pachalam Bhasi starts their new film with Shyam in the lead. Saroj bribes film associations and gets it banned. He gets the rank of Colonel in the Army and shows of with it. This is when Babykuttan, another producer, comes into scene. He helps Alex Samuel and Pachalam Bhasi to resume their project. Saroj Kumar tries to cancel the film in many ways but it is successfully completed and is well received by the audiences. Meanwhile, the income tax department raids his premises and starts prosecution proceedings for tax evasion. Saroj is tense about this, and he drinks a lot acting in a different manner. Many truths regarding Saroj's personal life are revealed towards the end. The film ends a silhouette showing the film's timeline (and Saroj's failure) and Alex Samuel, along with Shyam, who is revelead to be the son of Saroj Kumar and his first wife, celebrating the success of the film.

The events were held in four cities: Costa Mesa, California in 2008, 2009, 2010; New York City in 2010 and 2011; Washington, D.C. in 2011, and in Kimberley, South Africa in 2011 and 2012. The aim of the competition was to raise awareness of skateboarding and to encourage participation in skateboarding events and activities. Organizers also aim to contribute new skateboarding infrastructure and boost retail activity in those areas where events are held. History The inaugural event was held in 2008 at the OC Fair & Event Center in Orange County, California, with approximately 25,000 attendees. In 2010 the competition expanded to New York City. In 2011, events were held in New York, Washington, DC and South Africa, where the first Maloof Money Cup World Skateboarding Championships were held in Kimberley. The event offered the largest cash prize of any skateboarding competition or event to date. Participants won up to $160,000 for winning a single event. A million dollar bonus was offered to any participant that wins four consecutive tournaments. All three of the skateparks built for the event were collaborations between event organizers, skaters, and the host cities, with the intention that the facilities would remain as permanent parks in those communities after events have been completed. World-class skateparks remain in New York City, Washington, DC, and Kimberley, South Africa. There has not been a Maloof Money Cup event since November of 2013, but there are plans for future events in the US and elsewhere. Money Cup Performers Maloof Money Cup events also feature music performers with a variety of artists from the hip-hop, pop and rock genres. Some notable artists have appeared including Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Lil Jon and Nelly. Results In 2008, for the professional street skateboarding category, Paul Rodriguez placed first, while Pierre-Luc Gagnon won the vert skateboarding category. In the amateur section, Dustin Blauvelt placed first and Lacey Baker won the ladies' section. In 2009, Chris Cole attained first place in the street section, Alex Perelson won the vert category, and Leticia Bufoni placed first in the ladies' section. In 2010 in the California competition, Cole won again in the professional street finals, the amateur section went to Ishod Wair, and the ladies' section went to Leticia Bufoni. In the New York competition, Cole won the pro street finals and in the amateur section Felipe Gustavo won. In 2011, in the New York event, Greg Lutzka took the pro street final win and Evan Smith took the amateur win. In Washington DC, the pro street final win went to Andrew Reynolds and the amateur win went to Ishod Wair. In the South Africa competition, the pro/open street final win went to Ishod Wair and the amateur win went to Justus Kotze. Maloof Skateboarding Assistance Foundation The Maloof Skateboarding Assistance Foundation is a non profit organization also founded by Joe and Gavin Maloof. It was inspired when Jake Brown, a professional vert skaterboarder, took a 50-foot fall in the 2007 X Games and came out alive, with some relatively minor injuries, but for the most part unharmed. The mission of the foundation is to provide grants and financial benefit towards medical expenses for any skateboarder injured while skateboarding, to purchase policies that offer coverage above and beyond basic medical insurance for Maloof Money Cup invited skateboarders, and to build skate parks and give them to communities for local skateboarders to enjoy. The first ever event by the foundation was in 2009 and was called Ante Up for Skateboarding, a poker tournament sponsored by Monster Energy. Jake Brown won the first ever Ante Up for Skateboarding and donated all his winnings back to the program. The event was such a big success that they held it again in 2010.

In 1941, she was run down and sunk by in the Mersey Estuary. She was salvaged in 1942, repaired and passed to the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT), renamed Empire Estuary. She was sold into merchant service in 1946 and renamed Goldfawn. A further sale in 1952 saw her renamed Creekdawn. A sale to an Irish company in 1954 saw her renamed Murell. She served until 1972, when she was scrapped. Description The ship was built in 1940 by Goole Shipbuilding & Repairing Co Ltd, Goole, Yorkshire. She was yard number 350. The ship was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of , and a draught of . She was assessed at , ,, The ship was propelled by a 115 nhp two-stroke Single Cycle, Single Action diesel engine, which had six cylinders of diameter by stroke driving a single screw propeller. The engine was built by Crossley Brother Ltd, Manchester, Lancashire. History =World War II= Fiddown was built for S Morris Ltd, Goole. She was launched on 9 May 1940 and completed in July. She was built for S Morris Ltd, Dublin, Ireland. Due to wartime export restrictions, she was placed under the British Flag, with Goole as her port of registry. The United Kingdom Official Number 164907 and Code Letters MJJY were allocated., Little is known of her service, although she was a member of Convoy FN 222, which departed from Southend, Essex on 14 July 1940 and arrived at Methil, Fife two days later. On 29 November 1941, Fiddown was run down by in the Mersey Estuary and sunk. She was raised and beached at Tranmere, Cheshire on 7 July 1942. On 10 July, she was refloated and taken to a shipyard for repairs. Fiddown was requisitioned by the MoWT. She was renamed Empire Estuary and re-entered service in 1943. She was placed under the management of Craggs & Jenkin Ltd, remaining registered at Goole and retaining the Code Letters MJJY. On 2 June 1944, Empire Estuary joined Convoy EBC 1, which departed from Barry, Glamorgan and sailed to the St Helens Roads, off the Isle of Wight. She then sailed to the Solent to join Convoy EBC 3W, which departed on 8 June and arrived at the Seine Bay, France the next day. She was to spend the next three months sailing between the Seine Bay and Southend, with a couple of visits to Southampton, Hampshire in August. In September, Empire Estuary was operating in convoys between Newhaven, East Sussex and Dieppe, France. =Post-war= In 1946, Empire Estuary was sold to E J & W Goldsmith Ltd, London and renamed Goldfawn. In 1952, Goldfawn was sold to Springwell Shipping Co Ltd, London and renamed Creekdawn. In 1952, Creekdawn was sold to James Tyrrell, Arklow, and renamed Murell (derived from his wife's name, Kathleen Muriel Tyrrell (née Hicks)). In 1966, Arklow Shipping Ltd was formed in Arklow. Murell was one of the original seven ships owned by the company. She served until February 1972, when she was scrapped in Dublin.

It also stars Martin Milner and Andy Devine, with co-stars Joyce Meadows and Jim Davis. The film tells the story of a boy who, when forced to give his pet mountain lion to the local zoo, becomes upset at the living conditions of the animals there and attempts to free them. Originally released by MGM as a children's matinee feature, the film has subsequently been released on home video by Warner Bros.' family entertainment division.  Plot  In a frame story, Branch Hawksbill, assistant director of a city zoo, is visited by a father and son who have a bear cub they found during a camping trip. The father tries to convince his son, Tim, that the bear should be donated to the zoo. Tim refuses, equating the zoo to a prison. Branch proceeds to tell Tim about another boy who faced a similar decision: \\\\---- Chris Carlyle lives in the countryside, where he has befriended an adult male mountain lion named Sunshine. Because Chris has treated the cat as a pet since it was a cub, it is very docile and accustomed to eating human foods. When Chris' parents inform him that they are moving to the city, Chris worries that Sunshine will not survive alone in the wild. Unbeknownst to his parents, Chris sneaks Sunshine onto the back of the family's truck and brings him to their new home in the suburbs, where the mountain lion's presence quickly frightens the neighbors. Zoo director Dr. Del Hartwood, his assistant Isobel Moon, and head zookeeper Branch convince Chris to donate Sunshine to the city zoo. When Chris visits the zoo, he is saddened to see that the animals are confined to cramped cages made of chain-link fencing. After having a nightmare about being locked in a cage himself, Chris resolves to free Sunshine. Seeing that Chris has a bond with the mountain lion, the zoo staff offer him a summer job as a junior zookeeper. Dr. Hartwood complains to members of the city's Parks and Recreation Commission that the zoo is under-funded and its facilities woefully outdated, which has resulted in injuries to some of the animals, but is advised that the politicians are unlikely to help unless pressured by public opinion. A trio of troublemaking boys harass the zoo animals, feeding cigars to a hippopotamus. While the staff are dealing with this, Chris steals Branch's keys and opens all of the cages, setting the animals loose to wander the city. This results in a series of comedic situations including an ostrich swallowing a portable radio, a bear riding a bicycle through the streets, a zebra getting into a family's kitchen, an Asian elephant drinking a man's bathwater, and several primates invading a toy store. Public panic ensues, and the zoo staff scramble to round up the animals before the police start killing them. Councilman Pew blames Dr. Hartwood for the escape and demands his resignation. After a few hours, most of the animals have either returned to the zoo on their own or have been recaptured. The police corner Chris and Sunshine in a warehouse and are ready to shoot the mountain lion, but Dr. Hartwood manages to calm the cat by feeding it whipped cream. To protect Chris and Dr. Hartwood, Branch turns himself in and claims that he released the animals in order to draw public attention to the plight of the zoo. At Branch's trial, Chris confesses, unwilling to let Branch take the blame. Dr. Hartwood passionately defends Chris' actions as being motivated by his love of animals, and for having shaken up the public's apathy toward the zoo. The judge dismisses the case and orders Chris to spend two hours each day working at the zoo for the rest of the summer. \\\\---- As Branch concludes the story, he proudly shows Tim the new and improved zoo voted on by the city council. The fence cages have been replaced by modern, roomier, open-air exhibits. Chris works there, happily caring for Sunshine in the mountain lion's new home. Tim consents to give the bear cub to the zoo, believing that it will be happy there. Cast *Jay North as Chris Carlyle, whose best friend is an adult male mountain lion named Sunshine.

It is a full-reference model, meaning that it requires access to the original and the degraded signal to estimate the quality.  History  The VQuad-HD algorithm was developed by Swissqual in 2008–2010. It was the best performing model in the HDTV competition to find the new standard that was organized by the independent and non-commercial Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG). VQEG then proposed the VQuad-HD model to ITU-T to form a video quality model standard – known as ITU-T J.341 – which was released in January 2011.  Applications scope  The ITU-T J.341 Recommendation provides a perceptual video quality measurement method for use in High-definition television (HDTV) non-interactive applications when the full reference (FR) measurement method can be used. The full reference measurement method can be used when the unimpaired reference video signal is readily available at the measurement point, as may be the case of measurements on individual equipment or a chain in the laboratory or in a closed environment such as a cable television head end. The estimation method includes both calibration and objective video quality estimations. There are four major areas where this model can be applied: # Potentially real-time, in-service quality monitoring at the source. # Remote destination quality monitoring when a copy of the source is available at the point of measurement. # Quality measurement for monitoring of a storage or transmission system that utilizes Video compression and decompression techniques, either a single pass or a concatenation of such techniques. # Lab testing of video systems. VQuad-HD flowchart  Overview of the model  The model predicts the video quality as it is perceived by subjects (viewers). The prediction model uses psycho-visual and cognitive inspired modelling to emulate subjective perception. It compares the high quality reference video and the associated degraded video sequence under test. The estimation process is based on the following steps: # Preprocessing of the video sequences in particular, noise removal and sub-sampling # Temporal and spatial alignment between reference and processed video sequence # Analysis of the local similarity and difference feature # Computation of the global spatial degradation # Evaluation of the global temporal degradation by evaluating motion intensity # The quality score MOS is estimated based on a non-linear aggregation of the above features  Video formats/codecs  The objective model is tested on a wide variety of different frame-rates as used in TV applications (29.97 fps and 25 fps), in Interlaced video and Progressive scan mode at the resolution 1920⨉1080. Content of 1280⨉720 was included in testing by up-sampling it to 1920⨉1080, as this is the typical case for most consumer applications. Content with 24 fps was included in testing but re-played at 25 fps. Videos encoded by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC using either high or main profile, or MPEG-2 are supported. This objective model is deemed appropriate for telecommunication services delivered at between 1 MBit/s and 30 MBit/s.  Transmission impairments  The types of errors handled by model include packet errors (both IP and MPEG transport stream) such as Packet loss, Packet delay variation, Jitter, overflow and underflow, bit errors, and over-the-air transmission errors.

Geography  Mont Valier, the refuge des Estagnous and the Etang Long seen from the Port de Barlonguère A small glacier, the Glacier d'Arcouzan, occupies its northeastern slope. It is the only glacier in the Pyrenees situated below 3000m, the most Eastern glacier in the chain and also the most isolated. The summit is located on the perimeter of the regional park of the Ariège Pyrenees. A number of valleys originate on its sides: On the French side, the stream of Artigues, a tributary of the Salat (which itself rises a few miles from Mount Valier) and the Ribérot, a tributary of the Lez, itself a tributary of the Salat. On the Spanish side, the Noguera Pallaresa, and a few miles to the west, one of many sources of the Garonne.  Climbing  The normal route, in summer, starts from the Refuge des Estagnous and travels to the Col Faustin before ascending the broad South face. This is the easiest route, although it is still challenging. The other principal route to the summit is via the Arête des Antiques and involves rock climbing along an exposed ridge.

History During World War II, an escape route from Saint-Girons to Esterri d'Àneu in Catalonia crossed Mont Valier. The \\"Path to Freedom\\" - the name given in 1994 to the hiking trail that follows the course - enabled the evacuation of 782 people between 1940 and 1944 and remained operational despite increased surveillance by the Germans from 1943. The route was operational until the end of the war.

Recent scholarship suggests that the painting depicts \\"Tobit and Anna waiting for their son Tobias\\" instead. This interpretation is given in an auction catalogue from 1738 (see \\"Subject matter\\"), the first source that clearly refers to this painting. The painting appeared in Paris around the middle of the 18th century and made the rounds of aristocratic collections before being acquired for the royal collections housed in the Louvre Palace.See the Provenance in Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, vol. II, 644. See also, Anne Leclair, \\"Les deux Philosophes de Rembrandt: une passion de collectionneurs,\\" La Revue des Musées de France-Revue du Louvre, 5, 2006, 38-43. The presumed subject matter, the finely graded chiaroscuro treatment and intricate composition were widely appreciated in France and the painting is mentioned in the writings of many 19th- and 20th-century literary figures, including George Sand, Théophile Gautier, Jules Michelet, Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Gaston Bachelard, Paul Claudel, and Aldous Huxley. The ongoing popularity of the painting may be measured by its presence on the internet, where it is often used as an emblem of philosophy, or interpreted along esoteric or occult lines. Description Painted in oils on an oak panel measuring about 11 x 13 in. (28 x 34 cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most \\"graphic\\" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines.Jean-Marie Clarke, \\"Le Philosophe en méditation, de Rembrandt,\\" Cahiers de Psychologie de l'art et de la culture, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, 6, 1980, 132. The first figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure—a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator—is visible in 18th- and 19th- century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state.For example, this figure is visible in the engraving of the painting by Devilliers l'aîné in Joseph Lavallée, Galerie du musée de France, vol. 8, Filhol, Paris, 1814, pl. III. The third figure does not appear in the turn-of-the-century engraving by Timothy Cole in John Charles Van Dyke, Timothy Cole, Old Dutch and Flemish Masters Engraved by Timothy Cole With Critical Notes by John C. Van Dyke and Comments by the Engraver, The Century Co., New York, 1901, 32. As it is, the overall painting is quite dark due to the aging of the varnish.Ernst van de Wetering et al., A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, vol. V, The Small History Paintings, Springer, Dordrecht, 2011, 197. As Van de Wetering notes, \\"the paint layers were covered with an extremely thick, yellowed layer of varnish, as a result of which it is very difficult to get any clear insight into its pictorial characteristics.\\" Signature Engraved reproduction by Devilliers l'aîné after Rembrandt's Philosopher in Meditation (1814) The panel is signed \\"RHL-van Rijn 163_\\" at the bottom and left of the center, at a vertical from the figure of the old man. The signature was traced with a fine brush in light pigment on a dark background and is quite difficult to make out. The last digit is a tiny blob of paint, the form and placing of which would tally with a \\"0,\\" \\"1\\" or \\"2.\\"Jean-Marie Clarke, \\"Le Philosophe en méditation du Louvre: un tableau signé 'RHL-van Rijn' et daté '1632,'\\" Revue du Louvre, 3, 1990, 193-94. For the author's English translation, see: The type of signature—monogram plus patronymic—would argue for 1632, for the artist used this type of signature only in this year.Horst Gerson, Rembrandt Paintings, Artabras Books, Harrison House, N.Y., 1968: \\"The date has always been regarded as 1633, but the last digit may just as well be read as a one or a two, which accords better with the style of this tender painting,\\" 492. This does not mean that the picture was painted in that year or even in Amsterdam, to which Rembrandt had moved in late 1631. In any case, this type of signature is so rare in Rembrandt's oeuvre and date-specific that it argues for authenticity.Corpus, II, 641: the members of the RRP who examined this painting in 1968 were unable to see the signature. However, subsequent examinations by Foucart (1982) and Clarke (1990) confirmed its presence. Subject matter Anna and the Blind Tobit by Rembrandt and Dou (1630) While the traditional title Philosopher in Meditation has to a large extent been responsible for the painting's popularity, it is iconographically untenable. The painting shows none of the conspicuous attributes of scholarship or philosophy—books, globe, scientific instruments, etc.—and the presence of at least one other figure involved in domestic tasks does not fit in with the solitude associated with study and meditation.Clarke, 1980, 138-9. Though a large book and a quill seem to be among the few objects on the table in front of the main figure, they are summarily depicted and impossible to identify more precisely: a Bible alone would not suffice to make the figure depicted a scholar or \\"philosopher.\\" Staircases—whether spiral or not—were not an attribute of philosophy in the early 17th century. Similar observations argue against identifying the main figure as an \\"alchemist,\\" a subject that would allow for other figures, such as an assistant tending a fire. The objects depicted suggest a domestic setting, yet the improbable architecture speaks more for a history than a genre subject. The French art historian Jean-Marie ClarkeOp. cit., 198. argues that the scene is ultimately derived from the Book of Tobit, one of Rembrandt's favorite Old Testament sources.Julius S. Held, Rembrandt and the Book of Tobit, Gehenna Press, Northampton MA, 1964. The sole objection to this interpretation is that, apart from the two main figures—the blind Tobit and his wife Anna— there is no identifying attribute, such as Anna's spinning wheel. Nevertheless, a plausible interpretation of the scene is Tobit and Anna waiting for the return of their only son, Tobias, a scene that Rembrandt had already represented in another version in 1630.Anna and the Blind Tobit, 63.8 x 47.7 cm. This painting at the National Gallery in London has been re-attributed to Rembrandt, with a possible participation by his student at the time, Gerrit Dou. David Bromford et al., Art in the Making: Rembrandt, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2006, 62-69. This is supported by an 18th-century source identifying a Rembrandt painting of exactly the same format representing a \\"Composition with Tobit and a winding stair.\\"Corpus, II, p. 644: \\"Eene ordonnatie met Tobias, ende eenen draeyenden trap door Rimbrant\\" at the sale of the collection of the Comte de Fraula, Brussels, 1738. The Rembrandt Research Project dismisses this evidence as \\"certainly incorrect since there are two women in the picture and there is no specific motif from the story of Tobias,\\" 642. Earlier inventory mentions of a \\"winding stair with an old man sitting on a chair\\" or \\"winding stair\\" attributed to Rembrandt are vague and might even refer to the companion painting long attributed to Rembrandt, but now given to Salomon Koninck.See the Provenance in Corpus, II, p. 644: \\"Een wenteltrap van Rembrandt van Ryn met een oudt manneken sittende op eenen stoel\\" (1673) and \\"\\"Een wenteltrap van Rembrandt van Ryn\\" (1687). Here, as Clarke (1990) points out, the RRP uses the mention of a winding stair to support their hypothesis that the painting was intended as an exercise in perspective by a member of Rembrandt's studio or circle, but ignore the evidence of the mention of the master's name to identify the author. Although the title in the Louvre's publications remains Philosophe en méditation, catalogues of Rembrandt's painted oeuvre, starting with Bredius (1935) identify the subject more soberly as a \\"Scholar in an Interior with a Winding Stair.\\"Gerson, 1968, loc. cit.. Gary Schwarz, Rembrandt: His Life, His Paintings, Penguin Books, London, 1985, 198: cat. 214, Scholar in a room with a winding stair. With the rejection of the attribution to Rembrandt by the Rembrandt Research Project in 1986, the title became \\"Old Man in an interior with a winding staircase.\\"Corpus, II, 638-44, C 51. Companion painting: Philosopher in Contemplation or Philosopher with an Open Book Philosopher with an Open Book by Salomon Koninck The best explanation for the long- standing misinterpretation of the Philosopher in Meditation lies in the fact that, in the second half of the 18th century, it was sold together with a pendant of identical size (28 x 33.5 cm) that presented similar motifs—including a spiral staircase—and that was also attributed to Rembrandt. The paintings were exhibited together and titled interchangeably Philosophe en méditation and Philosophe en contemplation, or referred to simply as the Philosophes. The companion painting shows an old man in a vaulted interior seated in front of a table at a window on which we can see books, a globe, and a crucifix. These objects and his solitude make him a much better candidate for philosophical tasks than the old man in the alleged Philosopher in Meditation. In spite of the obvious differences in the composition and execution, no one called its attribution to Rembrandt in doubt. The great exception is the American art historian John C. Van Dyke, who whittled Rembrandt's oeuvre down to less than fifty paintings and made short shrift of the Louvre's Philosophers: \\"Small pictures over which, in the past, there has been much spilling of good printer's ink with no marked results. The pictures are not wonderful...\\".John Charles Van Dyke, Rembrandt and His School; a critical study of the master and his pupils with a new assignment of their pictures, New York, C. Scribner's Sons, 1923, 114-5. In 1955, examinations with X-rays and infrared photography at the laboratory of the Louvre revealed notable differences in treatment and caused this attribution to be dropped.Madeleine Hours, \\"Rembrandt. Observations et présentation de radiographies exécutées d'après les portraits et compositions du musée du Louvre,\\" Bulletin des Laboratoires du Musée du Louvre, 1961, 6, 3-43. Jacques Foucart (1982), Curator for Dutch and Fleming Painting at the Louvre, like Horst Gerson (1968)Gerson, Op. cit. and Werner Sumowski (1983),Werner Sumowski, Gemälde der Rembrandt-Schüler, vol. III, PVA, Landau, 1983, 1649 (cat. no. 1133): \\"Interieur mit meditierenden Gelehrter.\\" attributes this work to Salomon Koninck (1609–1656), a Rembrandt imitator, dating it to around 1645 and titling it Philosopher in Contemplation or Philosopher with an Open Book.Foucart, 1982, 98. Yet the real credit for the attribution to Koninck should go to John C. Van Dyke, who wrote: \\"In fact, one may be heretical enough to think that someone like Koninck or Dou may have painted them...\\"Van Dyke, 1923, loc. cit. He continues with: \\"The second picture, with the light coming from the left, seems a companion piece, but there may be some doubt about its being by Koninck. Its assignment is tentative.\\" The subject matter and details of the Koninck picture seem to have been directly inspired by a Rembrandt etching dated 1642 and representing St. Jerome in a dark chamber (Bartsch 105), which is the only other known work by Rembrandt that features a complete helical staircase.Clarke, 1990, 194-95. The traditional iconography of the Doctors of the Church and St. Jerome in particular provided the attributes for 17th-century representations of scholars in their study.Clarke, 1980, 121-28. In the last analysis, the only thing that the pendant has in common with the Philosopher in Meditation is the medium and format, which reflects more on Koninck's intentions than on those of Rembrandt. Any further speculation on the relationship between the two paintings must take into account a manuscript commentary from around 1750 by their first French owner, the marquis de Voyer d'Argenson, who states that the two pictures were brought together \\"by chance.\\"In the wording of the fragmentary note: \\"Le hasard qui les a rassemblé...\\" Leclair, 2006, 42. The marquis bought the Rembrandt painting from the art dealer Willem Lormier at The Hague, probably in June 1748 (not 1746). Lormier's wax seal is on the panel by Rembrandt, but not on the pendant, whose provenance remains unknown. Rembrandt Research Project and disattribution In the second volume of its Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, which covers the years 1631–1634, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) rejected the attribution to Rembrandt of the Philosopher in Meditation. Until then, and except for the \\"heretical\\" John C. Van Dyke, this attribution had been unanimously accepted by experts and art historians. The RRP did not introduce any new objective or documentary evidence, but based its judgment on an assessment of Rembrandt's \\"habits,\\" an appraisal of the painting's style, and the difficulty of fitting it within Rembrandt's production in 1632 or the later 1630s.Corpus, II, 641. The RRP did not make any guesses as to who the author of this painting might have been, but relegated it to \\"Rembrandt's immediate circle, or even his own workshop.\\" This judgment was analyzed by Jean-Marie ClarkeClarke, 1990, 191-200. who pointed out, among other things, that the RRP may have had a special stake in rejecting this painting, as the following quote suggests: \\"In the later part of the 18th century the painting enjoyed a great reputation in France as Le Philosophe en contemplation, and it helped to determine the image of Rembrandt's art to an unwarranted extent.\\"Corpus., II, 642. This disattribution was not accepted by the Louvre and other Rembrandt scholars,Roelof van Straten, Young Rembrandt: The Leiden Years, 1606-1632, Foleor, Leiden, 2006, 229: \\"It is not understandable that the Rembrandt Research Project does not accept the picture as an original work by the master.\\" and the newly configured RRP has changed its stance since then. In the fifth volume of the Corpus (2011), which covers \\"small history paintings,\\" the painting is classified without further ado as a \\"re- attribution\\" by the current director of the RRP, Ernst van de Wetering.Corpus, V, 197. The painting was officially re-instated in vol. 6 of the Corpus under no. 86 with the title Interior with a window and a winding staircase and the parenthetical information: \\"a study in Kamerlicht.\\"Ernst van de Wetering, A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings. Rembrandt's Paintings Revisited. A Complete Survey, vol. VI, Springer, Dordrecht, 2015, 523-24. St. Jerome in a Dark Chamber by Rembrandt Père de Rembrandt vers 1630 Esoteric, psychological, and philosophical interpretations In a lecture given at the Goetheanum in Dornach (1916), the ex-theosophist and founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner, described the Louvre Philosopher as the \\"purest expression of light and dark... All that you see here—the architecture and all the other features—merely provided the occasion for the real work of Art, which lies in the distribution of light and dark.\\" This, he held, was precisely the essence of Rembrandt's art. As it was, he showed only a \\"lantern slide\\" of the companion painting by Salomon Koninck discussed above.Rudolf Steiner, \\"The History of Art: Rembrandt\\" (lecture 5), 28 November 1916, Dornach (Eng. translation, Rudolf Steiner Library, Anthroposophical Society of America, N.Y., 9). With his inversion of the title, Aldous Huxley (1954) sums up most of the \\"deeper\\" interpretations of the painting: \\"There hangs in the Louvre a Méditation du Philosophe, whose symbolical subject-matter is nothing more or less than the human mind, with its teeming darknesses, its moments of intellectual and visionary illuminations, its mysterious staircases winding downwards and upwards into the unknown.Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, Harper & Brothers, N.Y., 1954, 95. The caption to an illustration of the painting (reversed) in the psychoanalyst C. G. Jung's Man and His Symbols (1964) reads: \\"The inward-looking old man provides an image of Jung's belief that each of us must explore his own unconscious.\\"Carl Gustav Jung (ed.), Joseph L. Henderson, Marie-Louise von Franz, Aniela Jaffé and Jolande Jacobi, Man and His Symbols, Doubleday, Garden City N.Y., 1964, 103. Jean-Marie Clarke (1980) advanced a psychological interpretation based on the circular form of the composition and the Yin-Yang-like distribution of light, reading the painting as a Mandala in the Jungian sense: an archetypal symbol of the integrated Self. The chiaroscuro treatment and the presence of many straight lines that are structured by curved lines speaks for an effort at reconciling oppositions. Further, Clarke interpreted the concentricity of the composition and wealth of circular motifs as metaphors for the underlying theme of the painting: the eye and vision. Like Julius Held,Held, 1964, 26-27. Clarke believes that the drawing dated ca. 1630 at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (Benesch 64) with the caption \\"HARMAN GERRITS van der Rhijn\\" written in Rembrandt's hand that shows his father in a pose similar to that of Tobit here, suggests that he may have been blind at the end of his life.Clarke, 1990, 198. Accordingly, the figure of the blind old man (Tobit) would stand for Rembrandt's father (d. 1630), who opposed his son's wish to become an artist and whose vision the young Rembrandt (Tobias) \\"healed\\" with the help of the archangel Raphael (\\"God heals\\", a name that also symbolizes Art).Clarke, 1980, 115-86. More recently, Clarke published an interpretation on the internet that relates Rembrandt's composition to the design of his signature in 1632. Jean-Pierre Dautun (1983), a student of the French philosopher Raymond Abellio, offered a detailed phenomenological reading along Gnostic lines, interpreting the central motif of the painting (the basketwork tray) as \\"the navel, the omphalos of the luminous hermetic secret that Rembrandt wishes to transmit: the phenomenological secret that the eye of the genius will be given to those who will conquer the genius of the eye. It is the ineffable secret of this transmission itself, the 'thou art that' of this mutus liber that is his painting, as if to permit an Occidental satori to a koan of his own devise.\\"Jean-Pierre Dautun \\"Le Philosophe en méditation de Rembrandt\\", Cahiers Raymond Abellio, 1, 1983, 42-51, 51 The French philosophy professor Régine Pietra (1992) published an essay in which she used the painting to illustrate the rhetorical figure of hypotyposis; Rembrandt's painting, with its interplay of light and dark, renders the experience of philosophical meditation visually perceptible.Régine Pietra, Sage comme un image. Figures de la philosophie dans les arts, Editions du Félin, 1992, 105-15. The Dutch philosopher Otto B. Wiersma (1999) published an article on the internet that he summarizes in these terms: \\"The painting of Rembrandt Philosophe en méditation (1632, Louvre Paris) can be characterized as a pictorial meditation on the miracle of vision. A better title would be Méditation visionnaire, because the painting catches the eye in more than one sense.\\" A discussion of the Philosopher in Meditation along essentially Gurdjeffian lines can be found on the Objective Art website (2011).http://objectiveandsacredart.ning.com/forum/topics/the-philosopher-in- meditation References External links * Research Project * Signature Files * rkd.nl Category:1632 paintings Category:Paintings by Rembrandt Category:Paintings of the Louvre by Dutch, Flemish and German artists Category:Philosophy and culture Category:Paintings based on the Old Testament ","title":"Philosopher in Meditation"},{"id":"32996859","text":"In molecular biology, ghrelin opposite strand (non-protein coding), also known as GHRLOS, is a long non-coding RNA.

Popham was admitted to the Middle Temple on 14 April 1762. Popham entered politics in 1776 and was elected to the Irish House of Commons in June 1776 as MP for Castlebar. Popham and was succeeded as MP by James Browne.  In India  Popham's fortunes began to decline in the late 1770s and he faced a financial crisis. He arrived in India about this time and was worked in Calcutta as Secretary to Sir John Day, the Advocate-General of Bengal. In 1778, he travelled along with Day to the city of Madras for an official inquiry. At Madras, a violent argument broke out between Day and Popham forcing the two to break up. Popham stayed on in Madras and purchased a plot in Blacktown and settled down in the city. Popham purchased the adjacent plot and constructed a drainage channel in the area. He then constructed a wide thoroughfare through Blacktown. The road was named \\"Popham's Broadway\\" and presently, it is known simply as Broadway. Popham was critical of the power and influence of the dubashes Popham recommended the construction of direct and cross drains in every street, the lighting of streets, registration of births and deaths and licensing of liquor shops and outlets. In 1782, Popham submitted a plan for the creation of a regular police force in Madras city. Pophams Broadway, Madras The Pophams Broadway at Madras was once a fine road bisecting George Town into Peddanaickenpet and Muthialpet. Before, it was a road, it was a ditch in the suburb called Atta Pallam, and was owned by Stephen Popham, former MP of the British Parliament and later Advocate General at Calcutta, who moved to Madras in 1778. Popham is credited with setting up the Madras Police in 1782. At that time, the lands of the present Madras United Club, General Hospital and Park Town Post Office was a hill called Hoggs Hill (called as Narimedu or 'mound of foxes' by the natives). Hoggs Hill was considered to be a security threat to the Fort St. George and a decision was taken to level the hill. Popham's negotiated with the Government of Madras to use the earth removed from Hoggs Hill to fill up the ditch. The road which came through after filling the ditch came to be known as Popham's Broadway.  Death  Popham died in Conjeevaram on 13 June 1795 as a result of injuries suffered during a fall from his curricle.

The CSJU manages the Clean Sky Programme (CS) and the Clean Sky 2 Programme (CS2), making it Europe’s foremost aeronautical research body. Overview Aeronautics is noted for its capacity to innovate and to change the lives of millions of people. Also, for the complexity of its hardware and systems, which means the research and development cycles in the industry (the time it takes for an idea to get from the drawing board to the market) are very long, typically between 20 and 30 years. The risk associated with the large-scale investment required to drive technological progress is very high. In parallel, the environmental impact of the industry currently accounts for 3% of global man-made carbon emissions and is set to increase substantially in the years to come, as modern societies demand better connection among people, countries and regions. By coordinating the research activities of the industry, the CSJU develops new technologies that would otherwise be beyond the manageable risk of the private sector: it provides the necessary funding to develop and introduce innovations within timeframes that would otherwise be unachievable. As such, the CSJU is intended to be the body that will be the main contributor in realising the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) 2020 environmental goals for the industry. These goals are: * A 50% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. * An 80% reduction in mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. * A noise reduction for flying aircraft of 50%. * Mitigate the environmental impact of the lifecycle of aircraft and related products. (1) Organization The CSJU Governing Board, made up of representatives from the industry and the Commission, identifies strategic areas where research and innovation are essential. ‘Calls for Proposals' are then launched depending on the evolving needs of the industry. Small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), industrial leaders, universities, and professional research organisations respond to the calls with detailed plans for research activities and an outline of the funding that they will require to develop their new technologies. To guarantee an efficient allocation of resources, the applications are evaluated by a panel of independent external experts who advise the CSJU on the proposals with the best potential. The winning proposals then receive funding and other support from the CSJU. The initial Clean Sky Programme, which runs from 2008-2016, has a budget of €1.6 billion. Half of this was provided by the European Commission’s Framework Package 7 Research and Innovation Programme and the other half was provided by financial and in-kind contributions from the industry leaders. Research areas The strategic areas where research and innovation are essential are called Integrated Technology Demonstrators (ITDs). There are six of them, each one co-led by two industry leaders that are committed for the full duration of the programme: =Green Regional Aircraft= Green Regional Aircraft (GRA): Co-led by Airbus and Alenia. This ITD focuses on small, low-weight aircraft. =Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft= Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA): Co-led by Airbus and SAAB. This ITD focuses on wing technologies and configurations covering large aircraft and business jets. =Green Rotorcraft= Green Rotorcraft (GRC): Co-led by AgustaWestland and Airbus Helicopters. This ITD focuses on innovative rotor blades, integration of diesel engine technology and advanced electrical systems for elimination of noxious hydraulic fluids. =Sustainable and Green Engines= Sustainable and Green Engines (SAGE): Co-led by Rolls-Royce and Safran. This ITD focuses on novel configurations such as open rotors and intercoolers. =Systems for Green Operations= Systems for Green Operations (SGO): Co-led by Liebherr and Thales. This ITD focuses on electrical aircraft equipment, system architectures, thermal management and capabilities for greener trajectories. =Eco-Design= Eco-Design (ED): Co-led by Dassault Aviation and Fraunhofer Gesellschaft. This ITD focuses on mitigating the environmental impact of the design, production, withdrawal, and recycling of aircraft by optimising material and energy use. Complementing the six ITDs is the Technology Evaluator (TE). Once the new technologies have been developed and integrated into a test model or aircraft, the TE assesses the environmental improvements by carrying out demonstration activities and test flights and comparing the results with aircraft that have not been equipped with the new technologies. The difference in fuel saved, noise emitted etc. is the extent of the success of the technology. Achievements BLADE demonstrator An Open Rotor demonstration led by Safran was launched in 2008 within the program with 65 million euros funding over eight years : a demonstrator was assembled in 2015, and ground tested in May 2017 on its open-air test rig in Istres, aiming to reduce fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions by 30% compared with current CFM56 turbofans. The Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe (BLADE) is an Airbus project within the framework to flight-test experimental laminar-flow wing sections on an A340 from September 2017. Other examples of hardware that have been developed with the support of Clean Sky include: * Open Rotor Blade: Blade intended for engines powering the single- aisle jets that will enter service in 2025-2030. * Droop nose demonstrator: This demonstrator is the 1.1 leading edge of a regional A/C for enhanced high- lift performances. The droop nose demonstrator is thought as a technology platform enabling full morphing capabilities, embedded CNT (Carbon nanotube) based ice-protection system, OF (Optical fibres) for strain measurement, temperature sensors, SMA (Shape-memory alloy) based internal patch actuators, SJ (Synthetic jets) for active flow control. * High Compression Engine Model: A new technology to provide a sustainable alternative to the classic turbine engine, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. * Smart flap composite load introduction rib: Full scale composite load introduction rib of a smart flap for DAV business jet application developed with resin transfer moulding manufacturing technology. This load introduction rib, involving the main structural parts of a flap, demonstrates the potential of low-cost, low- weight, low-complexity composite flaps. * HEMAS actuator: Fault tolerant Electromechanical Main Rotor Actuator including a safety clutch. The HEMAS System is enabling hydraulic-free, more electric helicopter architectures. * Fuel Injector: An early fuel injector from the Rolls-Royce technology for the Clean Sky SAGE 6 lean burn programme. * H1 Part 6: titanium fan wheel: New generation of lightweight environmentally friendly fan wheel of an air cooling unit manufactured by additive manufacturing SLM technology which provide an alternative route to conventional methodologies (bar machining). * Morphing flap two-bay prototype: Smart structure enabling the camber-morphing of a wing flap segment. * PRIMARY In-flight Icing detection system: Safely detects the presence of atmospheric conditions that might be conducive to ice build-up on the aerodynamic surfaces of an aircraft. * Electronic Power Module: A modular smart power converter with flexible power management for electric aircraft. * Solid State Power Controller enhanced with high-frequency voltage chopping capability for Electrical Energy Management strategy implementation: The overall generator weight can be reduced by up to 10% due to the removal of the 5-minute capacity overload. * GKN Scoop Intake with integrated electro-thermal ice protection and acoustic attenuation: ECS air intake with integrated electro-thermal ice protection and acoustic attenuation technology. Tested in GKN Icing Wind Tunnel in 2011. * Annulus Filler: The composite Annulus Filler is located between the fan blades and it directs the airstream to ensure optimal fan blade efficiency. * Green PU Seating cushion (Head Rest): Head rest of a three part seating cushion system. 22 weight% bio based flexible polyurethane foam without a flame retardant. * Seamless Morphing Leading Edge Demonstrator: Design of an actuation system that could deform a morphing leading edge seamlessly. * Nacelle Composite Component made with a liquid resin infusion process and cured on a heating tool: Nacelle composite part made of epoxy resin and carbon fibre by using liquid resin infusion on a heating tool. * Reference part of Demonstrator K1: Part of the radio rack section. It is made of ALUMINIUM 2024-T42. * IAI Part 1 of demonstrator K1: Part of the radio stack section. It is made of Magnesium Elektron 43, which leads to a 20-30% weight reduction. Clean Sky 2 Following the success of the initial Clean Sky Programme, its successor, Clean Sky 2, was launched in 2014(2) as part of the Commission’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. Clean Sky 2 aims to be the main contributor to the Commission’s Flightpath 2050 goals set by ACARE, which are more ambitious than those of the initial Clean Sky Programme. These goals are: * A 75% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. * A 90% reduction in mono-nitrogen oxides (NOX). * A noise reduction of flying aircraft of 65%. * Mitigate the environmental impact of the lifecycle of aircraft and related products by designing and manufacturing aircraft to be recyclable.(3) Clean Sky 2 will also contribute to maintaining global leadership in European aeronautics. As such, Clean Sky 2 will require a larger membership, a bigger budget, and research activity in a wider range of areas. = Ice protection = Within the programme, a passive ice protection system will be tested on an engine inlet and nacelle mockup in an icing wind tunnel at :de:Rail Tec Arsenal in Austria by early 2020, using capillary forces generated by vaporisation in a metallic porous \\"wick\\" in an evaporator to provide heat transfer with no moving parts to a condenser, like in space applications, reducing weight and energy requirements. = High-speed rotorcraft = Within Clean Sky 2, the EU funds two high-speed rotorcraft: the Airbus RACER compound helicopter and the Leonardo Next-Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). = Hybrid-electric = In 2016, French ONERA, German DLR and Dutch TU Delft/NLR were contracted to evaluate 35 radical configurations to replace conventional airliner designs from 2035, meeting Airbus A320 requirements: 150 passengers, a Mach 0.78 cruise and of range. TU Delft and NLR presented their distributed hybrid-electric propulsion (DHEP) study Under Novair project at the January 2019 AIAA SciTech conference, having selected three more likely configurations: * HS1, a parallel hybrid boosted turbofan for takeoff and climb; * HS2, a serial hybrid concept with distributed propellers along the wing leading edge powered by turbogenerators; * HS3, a serial hybrid with turbogenerators powering distributed ducted fans over the wing flaps and the tail replaced by two ducted props. Assuming 500 Wh/kg battery packs, achievable but beyond automotive or industrial applications, propulsion mass skyrocketed to 600% for HS2 and 730% for HS3, driving all the other masses and ending up consuming 34% more energy for HS3 and 51% for HS2, while HS1 showed a 10% better energy consumption.  Clean Sky 3  To cut 80% of air transport’s CO2 emissions by 2050, Clean Sky 3 would need reverse planning: due to the life expectancy of aircraft, required technologies would have to enter service in 2030-35 and should be demonstrated in 2025-27. The 2021-27 EU budget should be voted on by the end of 2019 and detailed allocation in 2020, with the Horizon Europe research and innovation program maybe including Clean Sky 3 starting on January 1, 2021 at best.

It was made up of both clerical and lay persons, and its members were Maltese as well as foreign. Its area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly ethics. It also gave considerable importance to biblical studies. Life of the Society The society was basically a joint venture between two priests, one French, Francis, Franġisku, François, Fransesco or Francesco Gesualdo, and the other Maltese, Andrea Axac (or Axiak). =The Founders= Both priests had separate schools of their own. Gesualdo already had an up and running school at Birgu, in 1526 when Axac transferred his own school there from Mdina. Though other private schools were also present, theirs became quickly known for their somewhat unorthodox teachings. Gesualdo's and Axac's friendship might have begun during this time. Axac did not stay long at Birgu, just a year or less. In 1527 he returned to Mdina where he continued teaching there for some twenty-five years (up till around 1533). It seems that his school, was quite popular. Gesualdo also moved his school to Mdina very shortly after Axac's relocation. =Proceedings= Around 1530, Gesualdo and Axac together began the Society of True Christians at Mdina. That was the year in which the Knights Hospitallers were entrusted with the Maltese islands. The society functioned uninterruptedly for some fifteen years under the guidance of the two priests. The society was made up of many of the students or former students, and friends, of both Gesualdo and Axac. They met regularly to read and share the writings of Martin Luther, and also of some others, such as Melanchthon and Erasmus. These authors and all their writings were condemned by the Holy See, and as such were fanatically sought out by the Inquisition. =Beliefs= Inspired by the Reformation writers, the members of the society harboured an alternative view to the current model of the Catholic Church, to which they all belonged. Amongst other matters, they seem to have denied the divine foundation of the sacraments and their supernatural efficacy, the law of celibacy, the veneration of saints and of sacred images, indulgences, the existence of purgatory, and the primacy of the Roman pontiff (the pope). Most members of the society were in possession of a copy of the New Testament in vernacular (which was prohibited by Catholic Church), which some had brought over from Sicily. Though it is not known which was the precise version they possessed, various editions could be found, notably those of Martin Luther, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples, the William Tyndale, and the Froschau Bible. This helped them to adhere to, and deepen, their own version of the philosophia Christi (the philosophy of Christ), about which they read in Erasmus’ writings. The society thus believed in a religion which was not doctrinal, and had no theology, but was solely inspired from the spirituality and morality of the New Testament. =Termination= In 1545, the Inquisition caught up with Gesualdo and Axac, and accused them and their associates of heresy. They were all held prisoners at the Inquisitor's Palace at Birgu while their lengthy proceedings were ongoing. They were probably also tortured. Eventually, the larger part of the society members were let off with an admonition. However, Gesualdo and another member, Petit, who were considered to be the most pernicious (perniciosissimus hæreticus). They both refused to reject their beliefs, and were thus condemned to be burned at the stake (uti pertinax et impœnitens ad ignem vivus damnatus). Their condemnation was publicly read at the church of St. Lawrence at Birgu on November 5, 1546. The execution was implemented immediately afterwards on that same day at the main square of Birgu. These were the first and, fortunately, the last execution of the sort ever performed in Malta. However, other available recordsG.

In 1562 Gesualdo and his companion Axac faced a trial for heresy (Lutheranism) in Rome. Inquisition instructed Gesualdo to publicly recant his errors. After the trial of Gesualdo and Petit’s killing, the society was disbanded forever. Known members The following are certainly not the only members of the society. They are the ones whose names have been recorded in the records of the Inquisition since they were considered the most ‘dangerous’ of all. The students, for instance, of both Gesualdo and Axac were never formally accused of heresy, and thus their names, unfortunately, have been lost. * Francesco Gesualdo (some sources claim was executed in 1546) – A French priest, possibly a Knight Hospitaller, considered by the Inquisition as the leader of the society. He ran a private school, mostly at Mdina, for over twenty years, mainly teaching humane lettere (human arts). He founded the Society of True Christians around 1530 together with Andrew Axac. In 1546, accused before the Maltese Inquisition, he was found guilty of heresy, deemed impenitent, and claimed to be burned at the stake. However, other recordsG.

It must have been an offence related to some breach of the vow of chastity, in which woman named Grima featured as Gesualdo's victim or as accomplice. The records mention that the errant knight, bound by celibacy, had to compensate Grima to the tune of 25 scudi promised to her in marriage. On November 5, 1555, the Council of Knights Hospitallers met again to hear the complaint of the Order’s criminal prosecutor, requesting the Council to start proceedings against Fra Francesco Gesualdo. He was now being investigated for serious heresy and had been placed in prison while justice was taking its course. Later, because of illness and as recommended by physicians, he was moved from jail and placed in the Infirmary which was to serve as his prison during his convalescence. But Gesualdo, without permission from the Grand Master, fled from the hospital and disappeared from the island of Malta. After hearing the report of the Commissioners and mature deliberation, the Council, as was customary, resolved to convene the public assembly of the knights to proceed to expel Gesualdo from the Knights Hospitallers. On 10 March 1562 Gesualdo appeared before Inquisition Tribunal in Rome again to be examined if he walks in the light or in darkness and was sentenced to do penance. Gesualdo abjured on 8 May 1562, was rehabilitated and even allowed to celebrate mass. What happened to him afterwards is unknown, possibly he could have traveled to Geneva which was an escape route for persecuted Maltese Protestants. * Andrew Axac – A Maltese priest from Rabat, Malta. Unfortunately, his dates of birth and death are not known yet. It seems probable that he studied abroad, perhaps Sicily or Naples, since he was well acquainted with the philosophy of the humanists. He had a private school, majorly at Mdina, before 1525 where he taught humane lettere (human arts). He founded the Society of True Christians around 1530 together with Francesco Gesualdo. After a trial in 1546, when Petit was burned at the stake for heresy, and Axac left off with just an admonition, Axac continued with his former beliefs. In fact, in defiance to the law of celibacy, around 1550, he lived with a concubine. Before that, however, in 1553, he was entrusted with the school of the bishop’s cathedral at Mdina. In 1560, however, the Inquisition sent him to Rome, Italy, to face charges of heresy. He was interrogated at length and perhaps also tortured. He signed an abjuration on March 10, 1561, and awarded ‘spiritual’ punishments (like for 7 years on Wednesdays and Saturdays to fast and recite prayers). His whereabouts after this are not known. He probably died abroad although witness accounts exist which claim that in 1574 Axac was seen teaching in his Mdina school (even though it was prohibited by the Inquisition). * Thomaso Petit (died 1546) – Little is known of the man, possibly of French origin. At some time, he seems to have joined the Society of True Christians, for when in 1545, formal accusations were brought before the Inquisition against its members, Petit was considered to be one of the most staunch. Sources remark that in fact he wanted to die a martyr's death. He was thus found guilty and, together with Francesco Gesualdo, was condemned on November 5, 1546, and burned at the stake in Birgu’s main square. * Matthew Falzun Sr. (d. c. 1574) – He was a member of the popular council of Mdina intermittently between 1534 and 1570. In 1546 he was accused before the Inquisition together with its other members of the Society of True Christians, and at first was released. Then, however, he was accused once more and sentenced to keep Malta as his prison. He was very much esteemed by his contemporaries. Years later, in 1574, he was again arrested by the Inquisition, probably as part of some corrupt practices on the part of the inquisitor, for there were on charges of heresy against him. Eventually, he was spirited away to Sicily, killed, and had his body burnt. All his considerable property in Malta was appropriated by the Inquisition, and this might have been the motive of his arrest and assassination. Since it was spread about that Falzun had, by some pact with the devil, mysteriously vanished from the Inquisition’s dungeons in Malta, it was rumoured that he was a witch (sahhar). Nevertheless, his effigy was put on public trial, sentenced to death, and burned at the stake in Birgu’s main square. * Matthew Falzun Jr. – Son of Matthew Falzun Sr., whose fate he would have shared to the end if he had not escaped to Sicily immediately upon the arrest of his father by the Inquisition in 1574. Since the main intent of this arrest was the appropriation of his father’s property, as his principal inheritor he was likewise in mortal danger. In his absence, the Inquisition in Malta accused him of heresy just the same, brought his effigy to an open trial, passed sentence, and burned his effigy in Birgu’s main square. Falzun Jr. was never apprehended, and his whereabouts after his escape to Sicily remain known. * Lawrence Falzun – The nephew of Matthew Falzun Sr., and the cousin of Matthew Falzun Jr. He would have shared the same fate of his uncle if he had not escaped to France immediately upon the arrest of his uncle and cousin by the Inquisition in 1574. Since the main intent of this arrest was the appropriation of his father’s property, as the next inheritor after his cousin he was likewise in mortal danger. In his absence, the Inquisition in Malta accused him of heresy just the same, brought his effigy to an open trial, passed sentence, and burned his effigy in Birgu’s main square. Falzun was never apprehended, and his whereabouts after his escape to France remain known. * Peter Stunica– Little is known about his personal life. In 1546, he was brought before the Inquisition as a member of the Society of True Christians, and accused of heresy. He was sentenced to a fine and some temporary ‘spiritual’ punishments. Nothing else is known of his whereabouts after that. * Brandan Caxaro (c. 1508-1565) – A Maltese priest from Mdina, today he is better known as the transcriber of Peter Caxaro’s famous Il- Kantilena. He studied abroad, probably at Naples or Palermo. In 1531 he was already ordained a priest. He worked as a notary, and it is in one of his tomes that he transcribed his relative’s Il-Kantilena around 1535. In 1546, he was brought before the Inquisition as a member of the Society of True Christians accused of heresy. However, he pleaded guilty, declared himself penitent, demanded forgiveness, and was forgiven. Nevertheless, privately Caxaro did not give up his former beliefs. In fact, around 1550 he took a wife, Katarina Azopardo, without applying for dispensation from the pope. She bore him five children. In 1563, he was brought before the Inquisition again, and sentenced to be indefinitely imprisoned at the dungeons of the place of the Inquisition at Birgu together with a host of other punishments, both spiritual and temporal. Caxaro submitted, and just a year later, in 1564, was allowed to work as a notary once more. Gradually, he was pardoned of the other punishments. Nevertheless, Caxaro was not to enjoy his new-found honour, for he died just two weeks after the end of the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, on September 22. * Peter Cumbo – Nothing is known about his personal life except that in 1546 he was brought before the Inquisition as a member of the Society of True Christians, and accused of heresy. He was sentenced to a fine and some temporary ‘spiritual’ punishments. Nothing else is known of his whereabouts after that. Works Up till now no work is known to have survived by the society or by any of its members. Since the members were all submitted to the scrutiny of the Inquisition, the likelihood of any of their writings surviving is next to nil. However, neither is it impossible. Appreciation The Society of True Christians must be appreciated against the social, political, religious and historical background of its time. Considering all of this, what Gesualdo and Axac did was certainly outstanding and amazing. The whole group was truly exceptional. It was not only up to date in terms of knowledge (considering the limitations of the time) but also philosophically engaging and interesting. Its members must be also considered to be very courageous people. The period of their operation was indeed bleak. Nevertheless, these people dared to entertain a new philosophy and dream a new world-view. Their ruthless destruction only goes on to prove how extraordinary their endeavour was. The main source of information about the society is practically only that of the annals of the Inquisition. This not only means that the records are extremely difficult to research (if not by a thorough expert in the field) but also taken with a pinch of salt, since the objective of the archives is not to show its victims favourably or in their true light but, on the contrary, to heap upon them shame and dishonour. Though the members of the society had the New Testament as their basic text, this is certainly not the only reading they did. They were thoroughly familiar with the Greek and Latin classics, with major Christian philosophers, and with the new readings of people like Melanchthon and Erasmus, amongst others. Their ultimate objective was, it seems, to develop a kind of ethical philosophy which was innovative and refreshing, leaving behind them the thought categories of old and discovering a philosophy which was at once more authentic and sensible.

The molecule is adsorbed onto a copper (111) single-crystal piece by chemisorption. The motor, the world's smallest electric motor, is just a nanometer (billionth of a meter) across (60 000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair). It was developed by chemists at the Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences and published online September 4, 2011. Background Single-molecule motors have been demonstrated before. These motors were either powered by chemical reactions or by light. This is the first experimental demonstration of electrical energy successfully coupling to directed molecular rotation. Mechanism of directed rotation Butyl methyl sulfide is an asymmetrical thioether which is achiral in the gas phase. The molecule can adsorbed to the surface through either of the sulfur's two lone pair. This gives rise to the surface bound chirality of the molecule. The asymmetry of the molecular surface interface gives rise to an asymmetrical barrier to rotation. The molecule rotates around this sulfur- copper bond. Electrons quantum tunneling from the STM tip electrically excite molecular vibrations, which couple to rotational modes. The rotation of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the electron flux from the scanning tunneling microscope and the background temperature. The tip of the scanning electron microscope acts as an electrode. The chiralities of the tip of the STM and the molecule determine the rate and direction of rotation. Images taken of the molecule at 5 K and under non-perturbative scanning conditions show a crescent-shaped protrusion of the molecule. When the temperature is raised to 8 K, the molecule starts rotating along six orientations determined by the hexagonal structure of the copper it is adsorbed on. In this case, a STM image taken of the molecule appears as a hexagon as the timescale of the imaging is much slower than the rotation rate of the molecule. Determination of rate and direction of rotation The six states of rotation of the molecule can be determined by aligning the tip of the scanning electron microscope asymmetrically on the side of one of the lobes of the molecule during spectroscopy measurements. When the butyl tail is nearest to the tip of the microscope, the tunneling current would be maximum and vice versa. The position of the molecule on the surface can be determined by the tunneling current. By plotting the position versus time the rate and direction of rotation can be determined. At higher temperatures, the single-molecule motor rotates too fast (up to one million rotations per second at 100 K) to monitor. Application The single-molecule electric motor can be efficiently used in engineering, nanotechnological applications and medicinal applications, where drugs could be delivered to specified locations more accurately. By altering the chemical structure of the molecule, it could become a component of a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). It also has potential to be utilized to generate microwave radiation.

It caters for boys and girls, aged 7 -18 of all abilities and offers both day and boarding places. It has a pupil/teacher ratio of 7:1 and its key strengths are its breadth of curriculum covering academic and vocational subjects, alongside its wide range of extra-curricular opportunities. Bredon School has a working school farm, CISCO Academy, award-winning Sixth Form work experience programme and much more. In 2019, Bredon was ranked number one out of 4434 schools and colleges in England for 'value added' for pupils aged 16-18 years in figures released by the Department for Education and in 2018, the Independent Schools Inspectorate awarded Bredon 'Excellent' in all areas in an inspection carried out in September 2018.  History  Bredon School opened in September 1962, with its main focus on providing a public school education for boys who had failed the Common Entrance Examination. It was established by Lt-Col Tony Sharp and Hugh Jarrett, who was Headmaster of Cotsbrook Hall, its feeder preparatory school based in Shropshire. The School started with 17 boys aged 13–18, all full-boarders, and mostly from Forces’ families. In 1982 the School extended its admissions to boys aged 11 and in 1989 it extended admissions further to seven-year-olds, whilst becoming co-educational at the same time. In September 2011 the School established a Reception and Years 1/2 class. One of the School's earliest and most influential teachers – and ultimately Headmaster – was Brian Llewellyn Thomas. He was innovative in his approach to education, pioneering the concept of Learning Difficulties and paying particular attention to Dyslexia. Thomas recognised that this under-diagnosed condition was a serious impediment to many pupils’ learning. He worked closely with Aston University researchers using Bredon pupils as \\"guinea pigs\\" in establishing the Aston Index. For many years this was a key tool in the diagnosis of dyslexia. In 2002 the school passed from the ownership of the Sharp and Thomas families to David Keyte, who as Bursar and managing director, had steered the School through the late 1990s and early 2000s. He then became Principal. In January 2009, Bredon School announced that it had become part of the Spanish-British education group, Colegios Laude. Keyte retired as Principal in July 2010. His replacement, Headmaster John Hewitt, took up his post in September 2010. From 2013 David Ward was Headmaster and then Principal of Bredon School. He left in 2018. Koen Claeys joined Bredon as Headteacher in 2017. In 2019 he left to become Headteacher at The Moat School, another Cavendish Education school. School ethos Bredon School aims to provide the environment, opportunities and support for children to fulfill their potential. It is a mainstream school with a specialism in helping children with Specific Learning Difficulties, such as dyslexia and dyspraxia. It has particular expertise in supporting children who have struggled at other mainstream schools and whose self-confidence and esteem are low. Many parental testimonials on the School's website speak of children who have achieved more than they, or their parents, ever thought possible. Bredon School also welcomes overseas pupils and has particular experience and expertise in supporting children for whom English is a second or even third language ESOL. Every year the school attracts a small number of boarders from various countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Spain and China. Some attend to gain the benefits of a UK education; others because provision for children with dyslexia is not as advanced in their home country. Learning through exploring The School has always recognised the importance of outdoor education, with expeditions and camps taking a high priority alongside team sports. Bredon School was one of the first to commit itself to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme and it is now an Operating Centre. One of the School's earliest and most uncommon assets was its working Farm. Pupils acquire agricultural and horticultural skills and can choose to pursue vocational land-based qualifications. Over the years the School has continued to develop its expertise with the addition of a Forest School to its other facilities. In 2011 the School received the Woodland Trust’s gold award for its woodland work. Pupils at Bredon School also take part in annual camps and training expeditions; from the North Devon coast trip to the Cairngorms expedition, all are designed to develop individual talents and team-work. Headteacher The current Headmaster of Bredon School is Nick Oldham. The School became part of the Cavendish Education group in December 2014, which has a number of other specialist day and boarding schools in the UK.

Its single species, Elasmopalpus lignosellus, the lesser cornstalk borer, was described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1852. It is found from the southern United States to Mexico, Central America and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Chile). It is also found on the Bahamas. The wingspan is 17–25 mm. Adults are generally brownish with narrow and elongate forewings with oblique distal margins. The forewings are yellow ocher to light brown in males and dark brown in females. The hindwings are whitish with gray to brown anterior and distal margins. The larvae feed on a wide range of plants but prefer grasses. Recorded host plants include a number of economically important plants such as Phaseolus vulgaris, Beta vulgaris, Brassica oleracea var. capitata, Cucumis melo, Cyperus esculentus, Zea mays, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus lunatus, Avena sativa, Pisum sativum, Arachis hypogaea, Capsicum annuum, Oryza sativa, Secale cereale, Sorghum bicolor, Glycine max, Sorghum sudanense, Saccharum officinarum, Ipomoea batatas, Lycopersicon esculentum, Brassica rapa and Triticum aestivum.

He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1836, M.A. in 1842. Higgins was inspector of the National Schools in Liverpool from 1842 to 1848 and chaplain to the Rainhill Asylum, also in Liverpool.Darwin Correspondence Project » Henry Hugh Higgins, 1814–93 In 1848 he travelled in Egypt, Sinai and Palestine, with his brother Charles. He was president of the Liverpool Field Naturalists' Club from 1861 to 1881. He especially worked on the Ravenhead collections, almost wholly made up of Upper Carboniferous flora, fish, bivalves and insect remains. Higgins had suggested that Ravenhead donate his collections to the Liverpool Museum and the donation gained a home with the construction of the railway in 1870, which exposed two Carboniferous seams known as the Upper and Lower Ravenhead. Most of Liverpool Museum's collections survived the Liverpool Blitz of May 1941 which practically destroyed the Museum itself, but the entire Ravenhead collection was lost in the fire.Palaeobotanical studies and collecting in the 19th century, with particular reference to the Ravenhead collection and Henry Hugh Higgins  Selected publications  * 1882.

He also played for Switzerland in the 1934 FIFA World Cup.Seleção Suíça na Copa do Mundo FIFA de 1934 He played mainly in the position as midfielder, but in his later career also as defender.  Club football  Hufschmid played a total of 402 matches for Basel between 1929 and 1950. He scored 83 goals during this time. 268 of these games were in the Nationalliga, 53 in the Swiss Cup and 91 were friendly games. He scored 51 goals in the domestic league, 11 in the Swiss Cup and the other 22 were scored during the test games. He played for six months for Biel-Bienne in 11 games scoring one goal. In the Season 1932–33 Basel advanced to the Swiss Cup Final due to a 5–3 win in the semi-final, in which Hufschmid scored the first goal, against Lausanne Sports. Hufschmid played in the final, which was played in the Hardturm in Zürich against Grasshopper Club. Basel won the final 4–3 and this the club's first ever title win. After suffering relegation to the 1st League (second flight of Swiss football) in 1938–39, during the 1941–42 season Basel achieved promotion to the Nationalliga as they beat Bern in the play-offs. Hufschmid and Basel qualified for the Swiss Cup final for a second time. This was played on 6 April 1942 in the Wankdorf Stadion against the Nationalliga team Grasshopper Club. The final ended goalless after extra time and a replay was required. The replay was on 25 May, again in the Wankdorf Stadion. Basel led by half time through two goals by Fritz Schmidlin, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave the Grasshoppers a 3–2 victory. After his playing career the Austrian ex- international Anton Schall, who suffered from a rare heart condition, moved to Switzerland and took over Basel as club trainer for the 1946–47 season. Basel advanced to the Cup-Final, which was played in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern on 7 April 1947. Basel won the final 3–0 against Lausanne Sport and thus their second cup title. Schall led Basel to win the Cup, but he died shortly afterwards at the age of 40 years during a workout on the football field. Following this unhappy event captain Hufschmid took over as player/coach and after his playing career he remained as team coach until 1952. He later managed Nordstern Basel and FC Breitenbach.  National team  Hufschmid gained 11 caps for the Swiss national football team. His debut was on 19. June 1932 as Switzerland beat Hungary 3–1. He scored his sole goal for the Swiss team on 29 October 1933 in the 2–2 draw with Romania during the 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification game.Because Romania fielded an ineligible player the FIFA accordingly awarded Switzerland a 2–0 victory for the match, but both still Swiss qualified for the World Cup 1934. FIFA, as well as both the Romanian Football Federation and Swiss Football Association continue to list the game 2–2. Hufschmid played both games in the 1934 World Cup. His final game for the Swiss national team on 4 November 1934 as they won a test match 4–2 against the Netherlands.

The bacterium is a short, gram negative, pleomorphic rod with flagella. It causes the disease enteric septicaemia of catfish (ESC), which infects a variety of fish species (including many catfish species, knifefish and barbs). The bacteria can cause either acute septicaemia or chronic encephalitis in infected fish. Outbreaks normally occur in spring and autumn. Edwardsiella ictaluri can be found in Asia and the United States, being of particular economic importance in the U.S. It is not a zoonosis. Clinical signs and diagnosis Acute ESC infection causes an acute septicaemia that presents as multiple petechial haemorrhages that develop into depigmented ulcers. Additional clinical signs include abnormal behavior, exophthalmos, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, edema and ascites. Chronic ESC infection causes a chronic encephalitis. Clinical signs include abnormal behavior, abnormal swimming patterns, swelling and ulceration of the head and death. Any fish that survive the infection become latent carriers of the disease. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the clinical signs alone but PCR, indirect immunofluorescence, bacterial culture and ELISA can be used to definitively diagnose the disease. Treatment and control Several antibiotics can be used to treat the disease, but there are reports of resistance emerging. Vaccination can be used to prevent disease. Management factors such as reducing stocking density and stress should be considered.

FRSE FSA (1741-1818) was a Scottish compiler and miscellaneous writer. Life He was born on 25 June 1741 at Dysart in Fife, Scotland, the son of David Beatson of Vicarsgrange.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was educated for the military profession, and on one of his title-pages describes himself as 'late of his majesty's corps of Royal Engineers'. The Dictionary of National Biography states it was probably as a subaltern in this corps that he accompanied the unsuccessful expedition against Rochefort in 1757 (but he was only 15 years old and he is not listed by the Corps History as being an engineer on the expedition), and was present with the force which, reaching the West Indies early in 1759, failed in the attack on Martinique, but succeeded in capturing Guadeloupe. He is represented in 1766 as retiring on half-pay, and as failing, in spite of repeated applications, to secure active employment during the American War of Independence. However, in 1784 Beatson was a first lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers and was stationed in Scotland.The History of the Corps of Royal Engineers, Volume I, Whitworth Porter, Chatham 1889, p216. Afterwards he seems to have farmed in Scotland. He became an honorary member of the Board of Agriculture, of the Royal Highland Society of Scotland, and of the Royal Society of Arts. He died at Edinburgh on 24 January 1818. One obituary notice describes him as \\"late barrack-master at Aberdeen\\". It is uncertain whether Edinburgh or Aberdeen university conferred on him his degree of LL.D. Works *In 1786 Beatson published in three parts his 'Political Index to the Histories of Great Britain and Ireland, or a complete register of the hereditary honours, public offices, and persons in office from the earliest periods to the present time'. It was dedicated to the author's friend Adam Smith. In 1788 it reached a second edition, in two volumes, containing nearly twice as much matter as the first, and a third edition in 1806. *In 1790 appeared, in three volumes, Beatson's Naval and Military Memoirs of Great Britain, from the year 1727 to the present time, in which the naval element predominates. It has lists of the ships in the squadrons and fleets of France and Spain as well as of Great Britain during the period dealt with, and also despatches, state papers, and geographical descriptions of the places referred to in the text. *In 1807 appeared three volumes of A Chronological Register of both Houses of Parliament from the Union in 1708 to the Third Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Besides lists of peers qualified to sit in each parliament, bounties and boroughs alphabetically arranged are given in chronological order, with the names of their members in every House of Commons during the period, and notes on the changes, with their causes, in the representation of each constituency. Election petitions and the decisions on them are given with a statement of the elective authority, and of the nature of the electoral franchise in each constituency. *Beatson was also the author of a pamphlet on the Battle of Ushant (1778): A New and Distinct View of the memorable Action of the 27 July 1778, in which the Aspersions cast on the Flag Officers are shown to be totally unfounded.

It is commonly known as Himalayan rhubarb,, Indian rhubarb and Red-veined pie plant. It is a medicinal herb used in the Indian Unani system of medicine, and formerly in the European system of medicine where it was traded as Indian rhubarb. The plant is found in the sub-alpine and alpine Himalayas at an altitude of 4000 m. Description The plant has a 1.5-2m high stem. Its stem is stout, red, and streaked green and brown. The large leaves are heart-shaped or roundish with a heart-shaped base, and greenish-red in colour. The basal leaves can be up to 60cm wide. It has dark reddish-purple or yellow flowers in late spring to summer, in densely-branched clusters, in a inflorescence up to 30cm long. The inflorescence enlarges greatly when in fruit. Developing inflorescence in the Oulu University Botanical Gardens, Finland, in early June. alt= =Similar species= According to the 2003 key in the Flora of China, this species is distinguished from other entire-leaved rhubarbs in China with leaves having a wavy or crisped margin; R. wittrockii, R. rhabarbarum, R. webbianum and R. hotaoense, by having less than 1cm-sized fruit, purple-red flowers, and the surface of the rachis of panicle being densely pubescent. It is the only rhubarb in this group to have purple-red flowers as opposed to various shades of white. =Karyotypy= A 1947 study found plants of R. emodi a chromosome count of 2n=22, but the same study found plants labelled as R. australe to be 2n=44. It is possible that this karyotypic diversity indicates the existence of one or more cryptic species, because the polyploid forms would essentially be reproductively isolated. Distribution Native to India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Sikkim.

X-ray radiography reveals that the figure \\"originally wore a more formal style of white shirt with continuous gathers under a slate-blue doublet\\".Whitaker and Clayton, 198 This has implications for the question of whether the painting was ever intended as a portrait of an individual, or, as is generally thought more likely, is an idealized and generalized image of a type.Woodall, 36–42 This type of painting can be traced back to Leonardo da Vinci but was taken up by several Venetian artists in the early 16th century.Whitaker and Clayton, 185 Though now not generally thought to be painted by Giorgione, the composition and subject are certainly very much in his style, and this may be a copy of a lost original by him. It is very similar in composition and mood to the Boy with an Arrow, (1506?) in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, which is \\"a rare example of a painting still universally attributed to Giorgione\\".

Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. This is agreed to be by Giorgione. Bernard Berenson was a strong supporter of the attribution to Giorgione, which still has some support. If by Giorgione, who died in 1510, it would probably date to around 1508. Crowe and Cavalcaselle had already doubted the attribution in the later 19th century.

The painting, in particular the composition of the head, also relates closely to another Giorgionesque bust figure in Vienna, David with the Head of Goliath; both may have a common model.

Commonly known members include beet, sugar beet, chard, and mangelwurzel, which all are cultivars of Beta vulgaris.  Description  The species of Betoideae are annuals, biennial or perennial herbs, vines (Hablitzia) or subshrubs. The flowers have 5 tepals (Aphanisma only 3) and 5 stamens (Aphanisma only one). The fruits of Betoideae are capsules that open with a circumscissile lid. In tribe Beteae, the perianth is basally indurated in fruit, and the stamens a basally inserted to a thickened bulge surrounding the visible part of the ovary. In tribe Hablitzieae, the tepals are not modified in fruit and membranous, and the stamens are basally united in a membranous ring.  Distribution and habitat  Most genera are distributed in Western and Southern Europe, in the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia, but one disjunct genus, Aphanisma, lives at the coasts of California. The species of Betoideae are adapted to different ecological habitats, several growing in coastal habitats, some on rocks and in mountains, one in deciduous forests (Hablitzia).  Systematics  Hablitzia tamnoides Patellifolia procumbens young fruit of Patellifolia patellaris Oskar Eberhard Ulbrich described the subfamily Betoideae in 1934 within the plant family Chenopodiaceae. He subdivided the taxon into two tribes, Hablitzieae and Beteae, the latter with only one genus, Beta. Phylogenetic research by Kadereit et al. (2006) confirmed this classification, whereas Romeira et al (2016) suggest only one tribe. The subfamily is now classified either in family Amaranthaceae sensu lato, or in Chenopodiaceae sensu stricto, (excluding the subfamily Polycnemoideae, as the other subfamilies of Chenopodiaceae, Betoideae, Camphorosmoideae, Chenopodioideae, Corispermoideae, Salicornioideae, Salsoloideae, and Suaedoideae, form a monophyletic group which is distinct from the Amaranthaceae s. str.). Current taxonomic treatments and morphological, physiological and phylogenetic studies seem to prefer Chenopodiaceae s. str. for reasons of taxonomic stability. The subfamily comprises five genera with about 13-20 species. * Tribus Beteae Moq.: ** Beta L., about 7-12 species in West-Europe, Mediterranean, Southwest-Asia, with the important crops Sugar beet, Chard, Beetroot, Mangelwurzel * Tribus Hablitzieae Ulbr.: ** Aphanisma Nutt. ex Moq., with one species: *** Aphanisma blitoides Nutt. ex Moq., an annual plant on Californian beaches ** Hablitzia M.Bieb., with one species *** Hablitzia tamnoides M.Bieb., a vine in the forests of the Caucasian floristic region ** Oreobliton Durieu, with one species *** Oreobliton thesioides Durieu & Moq., a subshrub in North-Africa, growing on chalk rocks in the Atlas mountains ** Patellifolia A.J.Scott, Ford-Lloyd & J.T. Williams (Syn. Beta sect. Procumbentes Moq.), was confirmed as a different genus. These are perennial procumbent herbs, with 3 species growing in coastal vegetation in Southern-Western Europe, with its center of diversity in the Macaronesian archipelagos: *** Patellifolia patellaris (Moq.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta patellaris Moq.), on Canary Islands and in the western Mediterranean (Spain, Balearic islands, Sicily, Marocco) *** Patellifolia procumbens (Chr. Sm.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta procumbentes Chr. Sm.), on Canary Islands *** Patellifolia webbiana (Moq.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta webbiana Moq.), on Canary Islands *Classification not sure: phylogenetically isolated, formerly included in Betoideae but to be excluded, maybe to be classified as a subfamily of its own. Recent molecular research provides some evidence for the inclusion in subfamily Corispermoideae: ** Acroglochin Schrad. ex Schult., with one species ***Acroglochin persicarioides (Poiret) Moq. = Phylogenetics = The subfamily Betoideae is regarded as a monophyletic taxon, if Acroglochin is excluded. The age of the subfamily seems to be relatively old, originating during the Early Oligocene Glacial Maximum, estimated 48.6-35.4 million years ago They early diversified into genera about 32.5 million years ago. The extant genera show narrow distributions in distant geographic regions, which may have resulted from speciation by isolation and following extinction events. The areals of Aphanisma in California and Oreobliton in North-Africa are interpreted als remnants from a Beringian ancestor, the disjunction circa 15.4-9.2 million years ago. The differentiation between Beta and Patellifolia probably occurred early in the Late Oligocene. Both lineages tolerate aridity and highly saline soils, so they were able to survive dramatic aridity events in the past that led to the extinction of other more vulnerable lineages in the subfamily.  Uses  Beet (Beta vulgaris) has an immense economic importance as sugar crop (sugar beet), and a great importance as a vegetable (chard, beetroot), and as fodder plant (mangelwurzel). This species is also used as medicinal plant, ornamental plant, dye and as renewable resource. It is the crop species with the highest economic value in the order Caryophyllales. Therefore, the other members of Betoideae, especially Beta and Patellifolia, are interesting as crop wild relatives.  References  The family Amaranthaceae at APWebsite.

It is served by regional trains between Munster and Hamm and is an important station for commuters and students. The station is conveniently located between central Hiltrup and Hiltrup Ost. In addition, the station is served by several city bus lines. History  In 1848, the Munster Hamm Railway Company () finished the Münster–Hamm railway. On 28 May of the same year it opened Diecke Wief station on the route. Due to its poor situation on the northern edge of the Hohe Ward forest and the long walk to the old village (now Hiltrup Mitte) the station was moved on 1 August 1868 to its present location. In October 1879 a separate freight yard was added. It was particularly important after the opening the Glasurit factory (which manufactured varnish) in 1903. The plant had its own siding, as did the Rockwool factory (a manufacturer of insulating material), which was built later. As a result of increasing passenger and freight traffic, a new larger station building was opened in 1907. The station building, which still stands, possessed, among other things, a waiting room and ticket office. The station, which survived the Second World War unscathed, lost importance in the decades that followed. BASF Coatings (which had taken over the Glasurit company) closed its own rail siding in favour of truck freight, leading to the closure of the freight yard. A new station building with a small ticket office and automated signalling was built next to the old station building, which was eventually closed. Current operations Platforms Platform 1 with timetable information, ticket machine and By the way kiosk Today about 100 train stop at Hiltrup station, which is used daily by about 2,500 passengers. It has four tracks in the station area, three of which are accessible from platforms. The fourth belonged to the former freight yard and is not used anymore. Through traffic currently runs mainly on tracks 1 (towards Hamm) and 2 (towards Munster). Track 3 is only used as required. The station has two ticket machines for regional transport and one for long distance services. Since late 2009, both platforms have an electronic passenger information display. Münster-Hiltrup station is served by three regional services: an hourly service of the Rhein-Münsterland-Express (RE 7) and a half-hourly service of the combined RB 69/RB 89 Ems-Börde-Bahn Regionalbahn service, which is uncoupled in Hamm.

The Deaneries of Jersey and Guernsey were transferred to the direct oversight of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Dean of Jersey was reinstated, with Archbishop Justin Welby subsequently issuing an apology to the Dean and his wife \\"for the hurt and the treatment that they had received”. Dakin commissioned a report (the Steel Report) in 2013, which found that there should be no disciplinary action against any Channel Islands clergy. The full content of the report has never been published. In the face of continued poor relations, the Archbishop of Canterbury formed a special Commission in June 2018, under the chairmanship of former Bishop of London Richard Chartres, to decide on a way forward. The Commission issued conclusions in October 2019, stating of Dakin's original handling of the case that “The suspension of the Dean came as a seismic shock to the civic authorities and churchpeople in Jersey, and triggered a breakdown in trust between the Church and people in both Islands, and Winchester. Questions were immediately raised as to the propriety, and indeed legality, of the Bishop’s actions.” The final decision of the Commission was that the Channel Islands should not return to the episcopal oversight of the Bishop of Winchester, but should instead be incorporated into the neighbouring Diocese of Salisbury, as a new permanent arrangement for episcopal care. The new arrangement is for both Jersey and Guernsey Deaneries, as relations had broken down across all the Channel Islands. In a report prepared for a visiting delegation during the Commission process, the Standing Committee of the Deanery of Guernsey wrote of its relationship with Bishop Dakin: “While the handling of the Jersey safeguarding issue may have been the trigger for the current position, it is not the only matter which has so seriously strained the relationship.\\" =Views= Dakin is a committee member of the Evangelical Group of the General Synod of the Church of England.

Painted in oils on canvas, Johannes Vermeer portrayed a young Dutch woman, most likely of upper-class-descent, dressing herself with two yellow ribbons, pearl earrings, and a pearl necklace. As a very popular artist of the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age, Vermeer depicted many women in similar circumstances within interior, domestic scenes. The same woman also appears in The Love Letter and A Lady Writing a Letter. The Artist Johannes Vermeer (1632- 1675) of Delft was one of Netherlands' most prominent Dutch painters. Specialising in interior scenes, Vermeer developed a distinct style for his many domestic paintings. Popular with middle-class patrons, Vermeer offered glimpses into the lives of Holland's cultured citizens. Although little is known and/ or proven about Vermeer's life, historians do know of his baptism and life in Delft where he was raised by a craftsman father and married a Catholic girl by the name of Catherina Bolnes. This marriage may have caused him to convert to Catholicism. As an innkeeper and art dealer, Vermeer painted dozens of paintings in which specific attributes can be noted. These attributes include the use of yellow and blue tones, the depiction of women, the use of wall coverings (maps, artworks, etc.), depiction of domestic tools, heavy drapery, light angles from the left, as well as prominent and telling facial expressions, and narrative-like objects. These touches allowed Vermeer to idealize his depiction of Dutch women and their values. Some of his most notable works include Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Love Letter, and The Art of Painting, all of which share the aforementioned qualities of a true Vermeer painting. Description Painted in 1664, this 21 5/8 X 17 ¾ inch scene depicts a young Dutch woman looking left toward a window's light source. Dressed in a yellow, fur-trimmed coat, this young woman most likely comes from an upper-class family. With Vermeer's distinctive style, it incorporates the color yellow, a draped curtain, framed pictures on the walls, a light source from the left, as well as domestic tools, and an expressive profile. For example, to the far left, a yellow, drawn back curtain is used. With a rich tone of lemon yellow to complete the woman's jacket, Vermeer is able to create a balance between the two ends of his painting. The window that the curtain would cover is very similar to that in his painting Woman with a Water Jug. On that same side of the wall, Vermeer displays a framed mirror. The black frame is most likely made of ebony, which indicates wealth and status. The fact that Vermeer uses a mirror is also distinctive. Vermeer associated the sense of reflection to portray the woman with vanity or feminine power. Also due to Vermeer's interest in certain Greek muses, he used the mirror to portray duality. However, according to the Essential Vermeer Website, other historians believe this mirror may indicate a Dutch theme of vanitas or the reminder of death. However, there is not a specific way historians can determine this. A large portion of the painting happened to be the white walls. This allows the painter to set a stage for his main subject, the young woman. Without any distraction on the wall behind her, the viewer can look more to the main figure's expression and actions. The young woman is definitely the most descriptive part of the piece. Like many of his other featured women, she is portrayed in a yellow, fur-trimmed morning coat. Comparing these trims, historians can investigate how Vermeer painted. From the microscopic brush strokes, historians can decipher many thin layers of gray and white, which reveal Vermeer's attempt to create realism. Like Vermeer, during the Baroque period many Dutch artists were striving for simple, clear, and natural realism. These coats also give historians a glimpse into the period. In the middle 1660s, many Dutch interiors were filled with a variety of furs. These pieces were commonly used during long Dutch winters. These styles of furs were actually recorded in Vermeer's home in 1676. The woman's facial expression is also telling. As she seems to be finishing up her morning routine, the young woman is caught clasping her pearl necklace together. Her facial expression stares blankly and almost vainly ahead of herself, possibly out the window or into the black-framed mirror. The woman retains a nice profile yet blank look. This three quarter pose was very common to the period and revealed a distinct quality of Dutch Baroque painting. Another important aspect of Vermeer's Woman with Pearl Necklace is the placement of the domestic tools on the table. A water basin, comb, and powder brush are all displayed on the table. This painting may suggest criticism towards a young upper class women's frivolity, lack of occupation, and her ample time for petty activities. Lastly, the deep blue tablecloth draped over the left side of the painting brings strong contrast to the work. Vermeer needed to create a contrast spot in order to maintain the geometric layout of the painting. Style Even when mixed with the numerous examples of Dutch Baroque painting, Vermeer's works are very distinctive. Painted in the mid-1600s, this particular piece had a very common theme. A woman at “her toilet” was popular among Dutch painters. Vermeer was uniquely talented. He specially used a unique version of toning in which he used shades of browns and grays to line out his work. He most likely then used more structured colors like red, yellows, and blues (his favorites) as glazed tones to add texture to certain aspects of this painting. Some historians speculate that Vermeer used camera obscura to create this artwork. If this hypothesis is true, he could have been able to use perspective lighting to create the piece. Vermeer most likely used the pigment Lapis Lazuli to make his works distinctive. Very expensive material, Lapis Lazuli was used in tiny amounts to create distinctive pigment for most of his works. Additionally, as mentioned before, Vermeer used a cadre of special features in his domestic works. Those include lighting from the left side of the painting, domestic tools, the pigment yellow and blue, Women, expressive faces, framed windows, mirrors, or walls, and large draped curtains or table cloths.

It portrays two women, a mistress and her maid, as they look over the mistress' love letter. The painting displays Vermeer's preference for yellow and blue, female models, and domestic scenes. It is now in the Frick Collection in New York City. Artist Johannes Vermeer was born in 1632 in Delft, Holland. He worked and lived in Delft all his life, although it is possible that he may have done an apprenticeship in another town such as Amsterdam or Utrecht for six years. A major stepping point in Vermeer's career was in 1653 when he joined the Guild of Saint Luke as a master and professional painter. Vermeer painted at a somewhat leisurely pace, producing two to three paintings a year; there are 35 known to exist today. Vermeer is thought to have made use of a camera obscura, which may have influenced the way he often painted highlights as unfocused circles of confusion.Wheelock, Arthur K. (1995). Johannes Vermeer. Washington, DC: National Gallery of Art. p. 162. . Vermeer died at a relatively young age, 43, in 1675. He suffered most likely from a stroke or stress-induced heart attack. The slow rate at which he produced paintings restricted Vermeer from becoming wealthy during his lifetime, and he died in debt. Description Mistress and Maid was painted during 1666–1667. The painting shows an elegant mistress and her maid as they look over a love letter that the mistress just received. There is a strong use of yellow in the woman's elegant fur-lined overcoat, and blue in the silk tablecloth and the maid's apron. The focus of the painting is the two women as they are sitting at a desk, doing an everyday activity. Vermeer was known for his domestic scenes containing women. The light in the painting comes from the left, and falls on the mistress' face. The mistress has a pensive gaze, with her lips parted slightly and her fingertips lifted to her chin in a questioning manner. The lighted parts of the yellow overcoat are formed with sweeping brushstrokes of lead-tin-yellow and the shadows are created with definition. Vermeer uses a dark background, as he does in other paintings such as Portrait of a Young Woman and Girl with a Pearl Earring. Pearls were an important status symbol of the period and that was reflected in the mistress' fancy attire and her abundance of pearls. Letters are a prevalent theme in Vermeer's paintings from the 1660s. Earlier works, such as Woman in Blue Reading a Letter (c. 1663–4), depict a woman by herself with a letter, but in this painting the added maid is a new element. The gestures and expressions of the two women suggest anxiety over the letter and its potential contents.Wheelock, Arthur K. (1995). Johannes Vermeer.

It is the study of adverse effects on the development of the organism resulting from exposure to toxic agents before conception (either parent), during prenatal development, or post-natally until puberty. The substance that causes developmental toxicity from embryonic stage to birth is called teratogens. The effect of the developmental toxicants depends on the type of substance, dose and duration and time of exposure. thumbThe first few weeks of embryogenesis in humans. Beginning at the fertilized egg, ending with the closing of the neural tube. The embryogenesis is the most crucial time for the action of any teratogenic substances resulting in birth defects. 228x228px Certain Pathogens are also included since the toxins they secrete are known to cause adverse effects on the development of the organism when the mother or fetus is infected. Developmental toxicology is a science studying adverse developmental outcomes. This term has widely replaced the early term for the study of primarily structural congenital abnormalities, teratology, to enable inclusion of a more diverse spectrum of congenital disorders. Typical factors causing developmental toxicity are radiation, infections (e.g. rubella), maternal metabolic imbalances (e.g. alcoholism, diabetes, folic acid deficiency), drugs (e.g. anticancer drugs, tetracyclines, many hormones, thalidomide), and environmental chemicals (e.g. mercury, lead, dioxins, PBDEs, HBCD, tobacco smoke). The first-trimester exposure is considered the most potential for developmental toxicity. Once fertilization has taken place, the toxicants in the environment can pass through the mother to the developing embryo or fetus across the placental barrier. The fetus is at greatest risk during the first 14th to 60th day of the pregnancy when the major organs are being formed. However, depending on the type of toxicant and amount of exposure, a fetus can be exposed toxicant at any time during pregnancy. For example, exposure to a particular toxicant at one time in the pregnancy may result in organ damage and at another time in the pregnancy could cause death of the fetus and miscarriage. There are a number of chemicals, biological agents (such as bacteria and viruses), and physical agents (such as radiation) used in a variety of workplaces that are known to cause developmental disorders. Developmental disorders can include a wide range of physical abnormalities, such as bone or organ deformities, or behavioral and learning problems, such as a mental retardation. Exposures to some chemicals during pregnancy can lead to the development of cancer later in the life of the child and are called transgenerational carcinogens. Exposure to toxicants during the second and the third trimester of a pregnancy can lead to slow fetal grown and result in low birth weight.  History  Researchers have been able to ascertain toxicity associated with abnormal development with new breakthrough in developmental biology. Recognition of the developmental toxic effects of various molecules is recent development. Terato means monster in Greek. Until the 18th century, the preformism theory was accepted by which abnormal growth was considered as deformations. The 19th century saw developmental in descriptive embryology where abnormalities were now considered as malformations or errors during a developmental process giving rise to the concept of teratogenesis. By the 20th century, the concept of epigenesis the interaction between a genetic program and environment was established and in the second half of the 20th century researchers had evidence that environmental factors can cause malformations and even trans-generational effects. = Maternal irradiation and congenital malformations = One of the first environmentally induced congenital malformations in humans were recognized as a result of maternal irradiation. Hiroshima (’53), and Nagasaki (’55), had ascertained this fact for the first time based on the records of births occurring before May 31, 1946, but after the atomic bombing (August 6, 1945, in Hiroshima; August 9th, 1945 in Nagasaki). A 20% increase in microcephaly frequency was seen in children with in-utero radiation exposure during the first trimester of the pregnancy (Miller 1956, 1968). Sensitivity to these radiations was seen to be predominantly high during the 7-15th week of gestation. Two important points observed during this study was: # The severity and frequency of the congenital abnormalities seen increased with dose of radiation which depended on the closeness to the source or explosion. # It was determined that there were critical periods of pregnancy when these exposures had the maximum effect on the fetal development. Cataracts in a child's eyes due to Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). = Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) = Rubella was the first recognized human epidemic of malformations. Following a widespread epidemic of rubella infection in 1940, Norman Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist, reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection in early pregnancy. This indicated that the virus had to cross the placental barrier to reach the fetus and cause malformations. The time of exposure to the virus also had a direct impact on the incidence of congenital malformations with exposure during week 4, 5-8 and 9-12 weeks of pregnancy caused 61%, 26% and 8% of congenital malformations. This was the first published recognition of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The progeny had congenital eye, heart and ear defects as well as mental retardation. = Thalidomide Tragedy (1950) = Thalidomide was extensively used for the treatment of nausea in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 1960s until it became apparent in the 1960s that it resulted in severe birth defects. Fetus that were exposed to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb malformation by which the limb were not developed or appeared as stumps. Other effects also seen with thalidomide exposure included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness. The thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in toxicity testing, as it prompted United States and international regulatory agencies to develop systematic toxicity testing protocol. The effects of thalidomide led to important discoveries in the biochemical pathways of limb development.  Testing and Risk assessment  Testing for developmental toxicant is done in different stages: * Fertilization to implantation - Fertilization followed by increase in cell number, cleavage and cavitation to form the blastocyst which gets implanted. Toxicant exposure at this stage usually prevents implantation and results in death. e.g. DDT, nicotine * Implantation to gastrulation - The three germ layers are formed and the cells start migrating out to initiate organogenesis. This is most sensitive stage for alcohol toxicity. * Organogenesis - It is the formation of limbs, organs, nervous system, urinary and genital systems by the process of cell differentiation, migration and cell interactions from the 3rd to 8th week of human gestation. e.g. DES * Morphogenesis - Includes the stages of growth and physiological maturation from week 8 till birth. Teratogenic effects results in deformations and rather than malformations in the fetus. * Post Natal to puberty - Environmental toxicant exposures. Because of the complexity of the embryo-fetal development, including the maternal-fetal interactions during gestation, it is important to understand the mechanism of toxicity and test the toxic effect in more than two species before confirming the substance to be a developmental toxicant. Embryo have different critical periods for the organ formation from day 15 to day 60 and hence the susceptibility to toxicant injury is directly related to the period of development.  Toxicity effects  Developmental toxicity is the alterations of the developmental processes (organogenesis, morphogenesis) rather than functional alterations of already developed organs. The effects of the toxicants depends on the dose, threshold and duration. The effects of toxicity are: # Minor structural deformities - e.g. Anticonvulsant drugs, Warfarin, Retinoic Acid derivatives # Major structural deformities - e.g. DES (diethylstilbestrol), cigarette smoking # Growth Retardation - e.g. Alcohol, Polychlorinated Biphenyls # Functional alterations - e.g. Retinoic Acid derivatives, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Phenobarbitol, Lead # Death- e.g. Rubella, ACE inhibitors = Effects on Neurulation = Neurulation is one of the most important stages in the development of vertebrates. It is the process of formation of a flat neural plate which then convolutes to form the hollow neural tube.Gilbert, Scott (2014). Developmental biology. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc. It is considered to be one of the main targets of developmental toxicity and defects in neurulation is a common consequence of toxicant exposure and results in large proportion of human defects. Facial characteristics that suggest the diagnosis of FAS. = Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) = Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a term that constitutes the set of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during the course of pregnancy. These effects can include physical and cognitive problems. FASD patient usually has a combination of these problems. Extent of effect depends on exposure frequency, dose and rate of ethanol elimination from amniotic fluid. FAS disrupts normal development of the fetus, which may cause certain developmental stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Since alcohol elimination is slow in a fetus than in an adult and the fact that they do not have a developed liver to metabolize the alcohol, alcohol levels tend to remain high and stay in the fetus longer. Birth defects associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol can occur in the first three to eight weeks of pregnancy before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Cervix- The cockscomb, collar, and pseudopolyp of cervix. Cockscomb (hoods) are markedly enlarged folds of cervical stroma and epithelium . Low, broad folds are collars (rims). A pseudopoly is that portion of the cervix which is medial to a constricting band (sulcus) and has on superficial examination the appearance of a polyp. = DES (diethylstilbestrol) = DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a drug that mimics estrogen, a female hormone. From 1938 until 1971 doctors prescribed this drug to help some pregnant women who had had miscarriages or premature deliveries on the theory that miscarriages and premature births occurred because some pregnant women did not produce enough estrogen naturally to sustain the pregnancy for full term . An estimated 5-10 million pregnant women and the children born during this period were exposed to DES. Currently, DES is known to increase the risk of breast cancer, and cause a variety of birth- related adverse outcomes exposed female offsprings such as spontaneous abortion, second-trimester pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, stillbirth, neonatal death, sub/infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues . DES is an important developmental toxicant which links the fetal basis of adult disease. = Methylmercury = Methylmercury and inorganic mercury is excreted in human breast milk and infants are particularly susceptible to toxicity due to this compound. The fetus and infant are especially vulnerable to mercury exposures with special interest in the development of the CNS since it can easily cross across the placental barrier, accumulate within the placenta and fetus as the fetus cannot eliminate mercury and have a negative effect on the fetus even if the mother does not show symptoms. Mercury causes damage to the nervous system resulting from prenatal or early postnatal exposure and is very likely to be permanent. = Chlorpyrifos = It is an organophosphate insecticide which acts on the nervous system of insects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase but are moderately toxic to humans. But it is known have developmental effects appear in fetuses and children even at very small doses. It has been shown to cause abnormal reflexes in neonates, poorer mental development in 2 and 3 year olds, poorer verbal IQ in and 5 year old and pervasive developmental disorder in 2, 3 and year olds. = Environmental Endocrine disruptors = Endocrine disruptors are molecules that alter the structure or function of the endocrine system like DDT, BPA etc. Prenatal BPA exposure is associated with aggression and neurobehaviour changes. = Epigenetics = Most toxicants are known to affect only a fraction of exposed population. This is due to the differences in the genetic makeup of the organisms which affects toxicant metabolism and clearance from the body. Effect of developmental toxicants depends on the genetic makeup of the mother and fetus.  Major Developmental Toxicants  Some of the known developmental toxicants can be grouped under the following categories: Reproductive toxins: * Aminopterin * Methotrexate * Androgen * ACE inhibitor * Antituberculous drug * Caffeine * Cocaine * Coumarin * Diethylstilbestrol * Ethanol * Insulin shock therapy * Isotretinoin * Streptomycin * Thalidomide * Trimethoprim * Vitamin A * Vitamin D * Warfarin Anti-convulsants: * Diphenylhydantoin * Trimethadione * Paramethadione * Valproic Acid * Carbamazepine Chemicals: * Lead * Gasoline * Methylmercury * Polychlorinated biphenyl * Toluene toxicity Biological Agents * Cytomegalovirus * Rubella * Herpes simplex virus * HIV * Syphilis * Toxoplasmosis * Varicella zoster virus * Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus Lifestyle: * Tobacco smoking * Alcoholism Maternal metabolic imbalances * Cretinism * Diabetes mellitus * Folic acid deficiency * Hyperthermia * Phenylketonuria * Rheumatic disorder References Sources * Category:Toxicology Category:Teratogens ","title":"Developmental toxicity"},{"id":"32997791","text":"Dame Louise Casey (born 29 March 1965) is a British government official working in social welfare.

The Guardian reported on 10 September 2014: \\"In his written ministerial statement, Pickles says he has directed Casey to consider how the council exercised its functions on governance, children and young people, and taxi and private hire licensing.'\\" Casey's report was published on 4 February 2015, and found that the local authority's child sexual exploitation (CSE) team was poorly directed, suffered from excessive case loads, and did not share information. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said the local authority was \\"not fit for purpose\\", and announced proposals to remove its control from the councillors and give it to a team of five appointed commissioners. The Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said that his party had \\"let people down in Rotherham\\". However, Casey's report was also heavily criticised by social work academics in Community Care in March 2015: :\\"There are troubling aspects of the report...the process by which it was prepared, in particular the lack of rigor and transparency in the methods used to gather and analyse data...This gap [in methodology] ...should concern us as it goes to the heart of issues of accuracy.\\" Casey Review After the end of the Rotherham report, Casey was asked to undertake a broader review of community cohesion and extremism. The report criticised the Home Office for a lack of strategy to integrate new immigrants into communities and to respond to extremism among Muslims. The Review was finally published on 5 December 2016.The Casey Review: a review into opportunity and integration, UK Government report, 5 December 2016. The Review stated segregation and social exclusion are at \\"worrying levels\\" and are fuelling inequality in some areas of Britain. Women in some communities are denied \\"even their basic rights as British residents\\". The report described the plight of women in some Muslim communities, who were \\"less likely to speak English and more likely to be kept at home\\". Among Casey's recommendations were that immigrants could take \\"an oath of integration with British values and society\\" and schoolchildren be taught about British values. In March 2018, while speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, Casey suggested that, in order to encourage integration, the government should set a target date for \\"everybody in the country\\" to speak English. Conservative MP and former immigration minister Mark Harper welcomed the comments. Rough Sleeping Taskforce In February 2020 Casey was appointed by Prime Minister Johnson to carry out a review of the government's strategy to homelessness, which aimed to end rough sleeping by 2024. This work was redirected due to the coronavirus pandemic, and she is credited with arranging temporary accommodation for close to 15,000 rough sleepers as part of the government's Everyone In initiative. In May 2020 she was appointed to chair a specialist taskforce on rough sleeping, which worked with local authorities to prevent the return of rough sleeping as the lockdown lifted. In August 2020 Casey announced that she had resigned from her government advisory role, including Chairing the taskforce stating that she wished to concentrate on her responsibilities in the House of Lords following her acceptance of a crossbench peerage the month prior.  Honours and assessments  Casey was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2008 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to families and vulnerable people. In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. On 31 July 2020, Casey was appointed a life peerage in the 2020 Political Peerages as a crossbench peer. Bibliography *Casey, Louise. . Cabinet Office. June 2008; accessed 6 September 2011.

Career Crone qualified as a barrister, and after five years of private practise joined Mirror Group Newspapers. In 1985, he joined News International, appointed as Legal Affairs manager. During his time at the group, acting for The Sun and the News of the World, he won plaudits from both colleagues and rivals for his unerring journalistic instinct: \\"He is a unique lawyer in that he has great journalistic instincts. He is sort of 10% journalist and is incredibly streetwise.\\" A close personal friend of the late George Carman QC, Crone was one of the first media managers to use libel defence specialist John Kelsey-Fry QC. He also hit out at then Attorney General for England and Wales Lord Goldsmith for clamping down on media coverage of high-profile cases, such as the allegations of rape made against a group of Premier League footballers, before they go to trial. Resignation As part of his role at News International, Crone gave evidence before parliamentary committees in 2009, stating that he had uncovered no evidence of phone hacking beyond the criminal offences committed by the royal editor Clive Goodman. In 2011, within 10 days of the revelation of the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone, he resigned from his position at News International. He maintains that he did not see an internal report suggesting that phone hacking at the paper reached more widely than Goodman. Since police renewed investigations in 2011, 90 people have been arrested and 16 formally charged with crimes in conjunction with illegal acquisition of confidential information. Many of these people were employees or agents of News International during the period that Crone was the legal manager there. On 30 August 2012, he was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and was taken to a local police station for questioning.

This work of art is one of Vermeer's final artistic activities, providing insight into the techniques he mastered and approaches to painting he favored. The painting has been on display at Kenwood House, London since the 1920s, as part of the Iveagh Bequest collection. After being recovered from a theft in 1974, when the painting was held for ransom, The Guitar Player was returned to Kenwood House.  Background  Johannes Vermeer, Woman with a Lute, 1664, oil on canvas Vermeer's artistic style in the 1670s is often compared to his earlier style of the mid-1660s. The Guitar Player properly demonstrates the energy of Vermeer's late style. His earlier paintings portray quiet self-contained worlds, but The Guitar Player is different. His late style demonstrated abstract painting techniques, in which the depiction of motion is portrayed through the diffused illustration of shifting objects. With Vermeer's experience, he began to create paintings that demonstrate dynamic poses and actions, implying that a movement (or in this case, sound) is taking place. The Guitar Player is often compared to Vermeer's, Woman with a Lute.  Composition and Style  The Guitar Player represents a new direction in Vermeer's art. Because he developed and perfected compositional balance and harmony during the 1660s, he was able to expand and paint scenes that show imbalance and fluctuation. Vermeer's painting of The Guitar Player rejects compositional balance and harmony, which contradicts his previous paintings. This painting exhibits an unbalanced arrangement that depicts a lack of compositional consistency, but also rejects the past instrument of the lute to focus on the modern guitar. The rejection of the lute and depiction of the guitar may be linked to Vermeer's compositional organization. Vermeer painted the young guitar player far to the left, covering the right half of the paining in light and shadow. This imbalance gives the viewer a sense of change and movement. The combination of an uneven arrangement conjoined with a gleam of light coming from the right rather than the left, forces the viewer engage with the character and instrument in this painting. The compositional arrangement is reinforced by Vermeer's decision to specifically direct the light onto the guitar player, which helps the viewer feel the impact of her presence. As a result of Vermeer's decision to paint a single personality, a greater importance and focus is placed on the instrument. The inclusion of a pastoral landscape, dark curtains, three books, and a blue tablecloth provide a counterbalance to the overriding composition displayed on the left of this artwork. The late style of Vermeer utilized a number of painting techniques, most of which suggest an abstract style. His fascination with objects and actions that portray movement and sound are represented by an approach to painting that establishes objects as diffused and illuminated. In his painting, Vermeer integrated the use of abstraction through the strum of the guitar strings and movement of the right hand. Because this painting stayed with him until he died in 1675, we are to assume that this was his own stylistic direction, and not a request of a patron.  Visual Analysis  In this painting, Vermeer depicts a young girl strumming a guitar. The instrument is placed comfortably on her lap while she plays near a window, sitting in the corner of a room. Her attire is made up of an ermine-bordered yellow jacket, an ivory-colored satin dress, and a pearl necklace. Surrounding her is a painted pastoral landscape bordered by an extravagant picture frame, a blank wall, three books, and a guitar. Prior to this painting, Vermeer portrayed individuals with obscure expressions. On the contrary, this young girl has an open expression that is joyous and flirtatious. The girl's smile and tipped head, along with the fixed gaze on something just outside the painting suggests that she is playing not for us, but for an unseen individual. Her dress and hairstyle reflect the relevant fashions of the wealthy Dutch, in that day. The young girl is portrayed with wholesome features and a free expression, as if she is in the act of speaking or singing. The joyous demeanor established in this painting is conveyed through the young girl's self expression, the peaceful landscape pictured behind her, and the soft tones of light and dark. Due to these factors, Vermeer is able to provoke feelings of calmness and contentment. Johannes Vermeer, Lady Writing a Letter, 1665, oil on canvas = Yellow jacket and satin dress = Johannes Vermeer, Mistress and Maid, 1667, oil on canvas The morning jacket portrayed in this painting resembles five separate Vermeer paintings, three of which are A Lady Writing a Letter, Mistress and Maid, and Woman with a Pearl Necklace. In each painting, the jacket depicts different types of folds, distribution of spots, and fur trim. The thin patches of gray and yellow led-tin paint categorize the abstract pattern that establishes the folds in the jackets fabric and fur trim. Vermeer's devotion to painting light and shade can be acknowledged through the inclusion of dark brown shadows painted on the young musicians right arm and shoulder. From a distance these small patches seem blended, but they are actually laying side-by-side. Historians conclude that the fur on Vermeer's morning jacket was not made from ermine, but either cat, squirrel, or mouse. The fur was then decorated with faux spots. The jacket in The Guitar Player is one of the few surviving examples of 17th century overcoats. The depiction of a satin dress implies a life of luxury. The young girls gown is presumably starched satin. For the dress to appear heavy and shimmery, the material was stiffened with starch and then ironed. The act of painting fine materials such as satin, took time and talent. To realistically represent luxurious materials, the artist had to be able to depict small details in the folds and patterns of the dress. To complete such a task, the artist often set up a life-sized wooden manikin dressed in the garments. = Pearl necklace = Vermeer's depiction of a pearl necklace alludes to the young girls elegant lifestyle. In this work he used an abstract technique to portray the pearl necklace, which was replicated his painting, Allegory of Faith. To begin, he painted a base layer of dark greenish gray that curved around her neck to depict a shadow. Over the shadow, he created a hazy sequence of white spherical highlights. He didn't define the individual pearls to portray the natural translucence of the gemstone. Compared to his paintings of the mid-1660s, Vermeer simplified and dismissed intense detail for abstracted portrayals. This shows an outgrowth of his own style, along with a technique that was not frequented by artists of his time. = Guitar = Johannes Vermeer, Woman with a Pearl Necklace, 1665, oil on canvas Vermeer's depiction of a young girl making music is associated with the nobility found in artistic inspiration, as well as the art of painting in the seventeenth century. The guitar originated in Spain, and was keenly sought after in the Dutch Republic. Compared to the lute, the guitar was cheaper and easier to play. This instrument has been decorated with a combination of ivory, ebony, tortoiseshell, and mother-of-pearl. The soundhole is created with multiple layers of ornately scrolled paper. In the seventeenth century, the guitar was used as both a continuo (harmonic) instrument, and a solo instrument. The music the guitar produces is bolder than that of the lute, and this is due to the design of the cords. The guitars strings reverberate deeper and fuller than that of past instruments. It does not play as loud as the modern flamenco guitar, and the gut strings are played with fingers. This painting depicts a five-course guitar, which was standard for most solo musicians. Vermeer's depiction of a guitar suggests a move into the modern world of music, in which the lute is left behind with its contemplative and conservative traditions. The depiction of this guitar was created with immense attention to detail. The sound hole is created with a depiction of a finely tooled gold rose, where Vermeer has created an abstract arrangement of painted strokes. These strokes are highlighted with hazy accents of lead-tin yellow paint. The decorative white and black trim of the guitars border intensifies the painting's cheerful atmosphere. The small detailed sound hole was created with blobs of impasto paint, which portrays the light reflecting across its slick uneven surface. The most influential and well thought out technique Vermeer used in this painting focusses on the guitar's strings. Some of the strings are blurred, this suggests that they have been strummed and are vibrating. Because of this, we can assume she is in the midst of playing a song. = Landscape painting = Vermeer's picture-within-a-picture was identified by art historian Gregor Weber. The landscape that is depicted behind the young girls head is identified with Pieter Jansz's, A Wooded Landscape with a Gentleman and Dogs in the Foreground. In Vermeer's version, the mimicked composition is cropped slightly on top, and on the right. The head of the young musician covers the gentleman and dogs. Vermeer's version guides the viewers focus towards the centered tree, as well as incorporating blue skies and greener foliage. Vermeer may have incorporated this sun-filled pastoral landscape into his painting in reference to woman's beauty. Artists in the seventeenth century were often attributing the topic of female beauty to nature, which was frequently expressed through poetry and music. = Wall = Vermeer's depiction of a whitewashed wall allowed him to set the stage for a scene that illustrates an individual strumming a guitar composed on the left side of the canvas. The painting's composition is balanced due to the large negative space the wall creates. The unobtrusive wall helps establish the mood of the painting, as well as the lighting scheme and spatial depth. Because of the wall's color, Vermeer was able to establish a warm and welcoming temperature from the incoming light. Vermeer's brushwork also implies the lights direction. According to the Delft building historian Wim Weeve, the use of whitewashed walls was frequently integrated in the houses, castles, and churches of the Dutch in the Middle Ages. The beginning process of whitewashing a wall starts with a thick application of lime putty, which is created with burned seashells. When the putty dries, and the wall is thick enough, then the process of whitewashing with paint can begin. = Chair = Although unrecognizable to the untrained eye, this wooden chair is portrayed several times through Vermeer's artistic career. At the top left hand side of the painting, behind her shoulder, a silhouette of a lion head finial can be found. This finial references chairs designed and crafted by the Spanish. When constructing this chair, the Spanish craftsman used leather and not cloth. This is due to Spains constant supply of rawhide. These chairs were respected for their craftsmanship and creativity, and the creators of these chairs regarded themselves as superior within the craftsman guilds. = Books = Vermeer's decision to depict three books suggests the young girls sophistication, which is implied through a high level of education. Even though scholars do not know the book titles, it has been argued that the middle book's bulkiness resembles the Bible, and its been stated that the possible representation of the Bible implies biblical advice. If this is true, then the painting could indicate a decision to morally ignore the religious text. The young girl's body language and facial expression turn away from the book to pay attention to the individual on her right. Others argue that the presence of the book implies learning, which is familiar in Dutch paintings of the Middle Ages. According to scholar Elise Goodman, the young musician featured in this painting would be a member of the haute bourgeoisie who could read, write, and speak several languages.  Provenance  After Vermeer's death in 1675, the painting stayed in Delft in the hands of Maria de Knuijt, his widow. In 1682, Maria gave the painting to their daughter, Magdalena van Ruijven. After Magdalena's death, the painting was passed on to her widower, Jacob Abrahamsz Dissius, in 1695. On the 16th of May, 1696, the painting was auctioned off at a Dissius sale in Amsterdam. From 1794 to 1802, The Guitar Player was in the hands of Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston, in London. From the dates of 1802 to 1865, the painting was owned by Temple's son, Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston. Eventually, the painting was in the ownership of John Temple's step-son, William Francis Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple, from 1865 - 1888. In 1888, his step son, Evelyn Melbourne Ashley, sold the painting to Thomas Agnew and Sons, in London. Between the dates of 1888 and 1889, the painting was sold by the Agnews to Edward Guinness. From the dates of 1889 to 1927, the painting was in the hands of Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, in London. In 2012, Kenwood House closed for renovations. While construction was taking place, the painting was on display in the National Gallery, beside the visiting galley's own two Vermeer's. In 2013, The painting was returned in late December when construction was over. The Guitar Player is currently on display in the Kenwood House in London, as part of the Iveagh Bequest collection. = Theft = On February 23, 1974, someone stole the painting from Kenwood House and ransomed it for a deal to deliver and distribute over $1 million (US) dollars in food to the Caribbean island of Grenada, or the thief would destroy the painting. Following the threat, a small strip of the painting was sent to The Times in London, along with another demand that requested the Irish Republican sisters Marian and Dolours Price be allowed to serve their prison sentences near their homes in Northern Ireland. It was recovered by Scotland Yard in the cemetery of St Bartholomew-the-Great, in London's financial district, on May 7, 1974. The painting showed signs of dampness, but was otherwise undamaged. A period copy, A Lady Playing the Guitar, is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

It is classified as a single tribe of subfamily Camphorosmoideae.  Description  The Camphorosmeae are mostly dwarf shrubs or annuals (rarely perennial herbs) with spreading or ascending branches. The plants are more or less densely covered with appressed or spreading hairs. The alternate leaves are often succulent, only a few annual species have thin and flat leaves. The inconspicuous flowers sit solitary or in axillary clusters of 2–3 (5) in the axil of a subtending bract. They differ from the related subfamily Salsoloideae by the absence of bracteoles. The flowers are mostly bisexual. The perianth consists of (3–) 5 membranous or scarious tepals, which are often fused for about 1/5 to 4/5 of their length. 4–5 stamens are basally fused in a hypogynous disc. They have mostly exserted anthers without appendages. The pollen grains differ from Salsoloideae by greater diameter, and higher number of smaller pores with fewer spinulae per operculum. The horizontal or more rarely vertical ovary is uniovulate, with a distinct style and 2 filiform stigmas with papillae on the entire surface. The perianth persists end encloses the fruit. The tepals can enlarge or develop wings, spines or long hairs, or become fleshy or woody. The seed with thin testa contains an annular or folded embryo sometimes engirdling a rudimentary central perisperm.  Photosynthesis pathway  The species of Chenolea clade and the large Sclerolaena clade are plants. In the Bassia/Camphorosma clade, all species are plants except Sedobassia sedioides which is – intermediate.  Distribution and evolution  The Camphorosmeae are distributed in mainly in Australia (c. 147 species) and in the temperate and subtropical regions of the northern hemisphere: Eurasia including North Africa (c. 27 species), and North America (2 species), in South Africa (3 species). A few species are naturalized worldwide. They grow in different habitats as shores, salt marshes and deserts in mediterranean climate to forests, steppes and deserts in climates with summer rains, from the Sahara to the alpine zone in Central Asia. Very often they grow in dry, saline or disturbed (ruderal) sites. The group evolved in the Early Miocene, probably deriving from halophytic plants growing at seashores in a warm-temperate climate. The species of the Chenolea clade are regarded as remnants of an early line of evolution. The subfamily spread from Eurasia to Australia, North America and at least two times to South Africa. The Australian lineage diversified strongly, the other lineages remained species-poor.  Systematics  Maireana sedifolia Bassia laniflora, illustration The taxon \\"Camphorosmeae\\" has been published in 1837 by Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher as a subtribe within the Chenopodieae. Alfred Moquin-Tandon classified it as a tribe in 1840, and A J Scott raised it to subfamily level as \\"Camphorosmoideae\\" in 1978. Phylogenetic research by Kadereit & Freitag (2011) revealed that the traditional classification of the group did not reflect evolutionary relationships. Most of the genera, especially Kochia and Bassia, were found to be highly polyphyletic, so some of their species had to be transferred to spearate genera: Eokochia, Spirobassia, Grubovia and Sedobassia. The Australian species of Camphorosmeae form a relatively young group still in the process of speciation and with some hybridization between species. In phylogenetic research by Cabrera et al. (2009), the genera were not clearly separated. Probably Neobassia, Threlkeldia and Osteocarpum should be included in Sclerolaena. Likewise, Enchylaena should be included in Maireana.

It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Divine Wisdom personified on the left and Hercules, representing Strength and earthly concerns, on the right. Wisdom gazes heavenward while Hercules looks down on jewels below him. The conflict between divine and mortal affairs is central in this allegorical painting. Subject In the painting, the virtuosity of Divine Wisdom appears to triumph over the earthly desires of Hercules. She is bathed in light, and seems to be rising, while Hercules is moving downward, towards deeper shadow. The genre of allegory contrasts with Veronese's well- known tableaus of historical and biblical scenes, such as the Marriage at Cana as well as with the less formal works of other Renaissance Venetian painters like Giorgione or Titian. This work, along with Allegory of Virtue and Vice also in the Frick Collection, is believed to be Veronese's first in this style. These two works are also thought by scholars to be his first to cross the Alps. Provenance The Allegory of Virtue and Vice and Wisdom and Strength have traveled together since their creation, through many prestigious owners and collections. Because of this, many scholars assumed that Veronese painted them as a pair. In 1970, Edgar Munhall was the first scholar to suggest that they were simply made at the same time, not as pendants.Mundhall, Edgar, \\"Masterpieces of the Frick Collection\\", 66. Work undertaken by scholars at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 2000s confirmed that the two were made individually. The scholars found that the artist used different materials for the supports of each painting, different makeup of the grounds, and differing methods of creating the skies. These qualities led them to conclude that the paintings were created as independent works, not as a set. This conclusion was supported by the visual analysis of the scholars, who felt that the paintings did not visually complement one another in a way that suggested they were painted as a pair.Mahon, Centeno, Wypyski, Salomon, and Bayer, “Technical Study of Three Allegorical Paintings by Paolo Veronese: The Choice between Virtue and Vice, Wisdom and Strength, and Mars and Venus United by Love,” 83-108. From its creation in Venice, this painting traveled through the hands of Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Christina of Sweden, the Odescalchi family, the famous Orleans Collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, and then through the hands of various Englishmen and art dealers before arriving at its current home in the Frick Collection.

The head is machined flat, with recesses only for inlet and exhaust valves, spark plugs, injectors and so on. The combustion chamber itself is contained within a dished depression in the top of the piston. The Heron head is suitable for petrol and diesel engines, for ohv and ohc valve-gear, and for small and large engine displacement capacities. While a flat cylinder head could be combined with simple flat-top pistons, that option ignores the reasons for having a depression in the top of each piston, namely: (i) it provides a compact space for combustion to begin, allowing an optimal flame front; and (ii) it creates significant \\"squish\\" as the piston reaches TDC. This causes turbulence, which is desirable because it promotes more extensive mixing of the fuel/air mixture: cf: cf1, cf2, cf3). Having no space available at the top of piston travel to maintain compression ratio would also mean that the air-fuel mixture would be compressed to zero volume (or close), which is far too high a compression ratio for any internal combustion engine to run on (due to detonation before the piston even reached top dead center) unless the stroke was carefully designed to leave a small gap between the top of the cylinder and the head when the piston is a TDC; in a normal engine the size of the combustion chamber dictates the compression ratio of the engine (i.e. the volume of the cylinder is compressed into the space of the chamber at TDC; a flat piston and flat head would leave no space for the air-fuel mixture, unless designed so the piston doesn't actually reach the top of the cylinder bore) Pros and cons * Advantages include: simplicity of manufacture; compact dimensions; accuracy of the flat machined surface; simplified valve- gear; efficient combustion with good fuel economy. * Disadvantages include: the greater size and weight of each piston; volumetric efficiency poorer than conventional cylinder heads with non parallel valves.

The few relictual species are distributed in Eurasia and North Africa, North America, and Australia.  Description  The subfamily Polycnemoideae comprises small herbs; some species are weakly lignified and grow shrublike. The subfamily is distinguishable from all other members of Amaranthaceae by normal secondary growth. The alternate or opposite leaves are often linear or subulate. The stomata of the leaves are arranged in parallel to the midveins. The bisexual flowers are sitting solitary in the axil of a bract and two bracteoles. The inconspicuous perianth is formed of chartaceous, scarious, white or pinkish tepals. One to five stamens are present with their filaments united in a short but distinct filament tube (like in subfamily Amaranthoideae). Anthers are with only one lobe and two pollen sacs (bilocular, like in subfamily Gomphrenoideae). In fruit, the tepals are never conspicuously modified.  Photosynthesis pathway  The Polycnemoideae are all C3-plants. This is considered a primary character.  Distribution and evolution  The Polycnemoideae are distributed in the temperate regions of Eurasia (central and southern Europe, northwestern Africa, Central Asia), North America, and Australia. Polycnemoideae began to diverge from Amaranthaceae s.str. in Eocene. At the edge from Eocene to Oligocene, the subfamily split into a lineage on the Northern Hemisphere, which was the ancestor of Polycnemum, and a lineage predominantly occurring on the Southern Hemisphere with the ancestors of Nitrophila, Hemichroa, and Surreya. An antarctic connection of these southern ancestors is assumed. The genus Nitrophila developed in South America and dispersed later to North America. The genera of the subfamily diversified during Miocene and Pliocene, with only a few rare species that seem to be relictual.  Systematics  Polycnemum arvense, Illustration The intrafamilial position of the Polycnemoideae has long been a matter of dispute. The taxon was recognized in 1827 as Tribus Polycnemeae within the family Chenopodiaceae by Dumortier (In Florula Belgica). Later, it was treated as belonging to the family Amaranthaceae in 1849 by Moquin-Tandon (in Prodromus systematis naturalis.... Vol 13). Oskar Eberhard Ulbrich raised it to subfamilial level in 1934, again within Chenopodiaceae (in Engler & Prantl: Die natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien. Vol 16c). Today, both families are included in Amaranthaceae s.l. Phylogenetic research has revealed the Polycnemoideae represent a basal lineage of evolution within the family Amaranthaceae. The Polycnemoideae comprise only one tribe, Tribus Polycnemeae, with four genera and 13 species: * Hemichroa R.Br., with alternate, linear, succulent leaves, and stigmas papillous all around: only one species in Australia: ** Hemichroa pentandra * Nitrophila S.Watson - niterwort, with opposite leaves, and stigmas papillous only on the inside, 4 species in North, Middle and South America: ** Nitrophila atacamensis (Phil.) Ulbr. ** Nitrophila australis Chodat & Wilczek ** Nitrophila mohavensis Munz & J.C. Roos - Amargosa niterwort ** Nitrophila occidentalis (Moq.) S. Watson - western niterwort, boraxweed * Polycnemum L., with alternate, subulate, non-succulent leaves, and stigmas papillous all around. 6 species in Eurasia (central and southern Europe, northwestern Africa, Central Asia): ** Polycnemum arvense L. - field needleleaf, soft needleleaf ** Polycnemum fontanesii Durieu & Moq. ** Polycnemum heuffelii Láng ** Polycnemum majus A.

He played in the low minor leagues for several seasons until he sustained a severe elbow injury in 2009. In 2010, Delabar worked as a substitute teacher and then became an assistant high school baseball coach. Delabar helped to implement an arm conditioning program for pitchers at the high school and found that his own pitching velocity improved significantly. After a tryout with the Seattle Mariners in early 2011, Delabar was assigned to the team's Class-A affiliate. He progressed to Advanced-A, Double-A, and Triple-A, then to the major leagues. His MLB debut came late in 2011 at the age of 28. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in 2012, and played with them through the 2015 season.

All three pitches are excellent strikeout pitches, with well above-average whiff rates of 25% on the fastball, 33% on the slider, and 48% on the splitter. The high whiff rates contribute to a K/9 rate of over 11 for Delabar's career.

Helms/Paula Watson, 'Brooke, Robert (c.1637-69), of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, Suff. and Wanstead House, Essex', in B.D. Henning (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660-1690 (from Boydell and Brewer 1983), History of Parliament Online. Dying at the age of 32, his promise was cut short, and the core of his estates in East Suffolk passed by marriage into the Blois family.  Life  Brooke was the second surviving son of Sir Robert Brooke of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford and his wife Dame Elizabeth Brooke, daughter of Thomas Colepeper (died 1613) of Great Wigsell, East Sussex. His mother was the only full sister of John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper of Thoresway (1600-1660), a prominent royalist politician and adviser to Charles I and to Charles II during his exile.P.C. Yorke, 'Colepeper, John Colepeper, 1st Baron', in H. Chesney (ed.), Encyclopedia Britannica (1911), VI, pp. 675-76. Robert was educated privately under Daniel Milles. Following the death of his father in 1646, the Yoxford estate remained under the oversight of his mother Dame Elizabeth; his elder brother, John Brooke Esq (born c. 1626), married Jane Barnardiston, upon whom the Blythburgh estate was settled as a jointure,T. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), p. 142 (Google). and was seated at Westwood Lodge, the house associated with the principal manor of Blythburgh. John, who continued his father's unpopular policies towards the townsfolk of Walberswick,Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, pp. 173-76 (Google). died suddenly and unexpectedly in October 1652 without a male heir, making his widow Joan his sole legatee and administratrix.Will of John Brooke of Westwood Lodge, Suffolk (P.C.C. 1653, Brent quire). Martha Brooke (a sister of John's and Robert's), married (Sir) William Blois, the younger (died 1676), and had four sons and three daughters by him, but she died in 1657 aged about 29.'The Life and Death of the Lady Elizabeth Brooke', in N. Parkhurst, The Faithful and Diligent Christian Described and Identified (Samuel Sprint and John Harding, London 1684), pp. 41-81, at pp. 45-46 (eebo/tcp II). William Blois then in 1659 remarried to Jane Brooke, widow of John Brooke.E. Farrer, 'The Blois MSS', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and Natural History XIV Part 2 (1911), pp. 147-226: at p. 150 (Society's pdf). Robert the second son, born c. 1637, was only 15 at the death of his brother. On 26 April 1659 he married Anne Margarett Mildmay, daughter of Sir Henry Mildmay of Wanstead, Essex,Will of Sir Robert Brooke, Kt., of Yoxford (P.C.C. 1670, Coke quire). who was Master of the Jewel Office from 1620 to 1649.J.T. Peacey, 'Mildmay, Henry', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004). In that year Robert became JP for Suffolk and a commissioner for the militia. In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh in the Convention Parliament. He also became lieutenant colonel of the Suffolk Militia in April 1660. He was knighted on 9 June 1660 for his services to the Restoration of the Monarchy. In July 1660 he received a commission of oyer and terminer for Middlesex, and in August 1660 had a commission for assessment in Suffolk. Brooke was re-elected MP for Aldeburgh in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament where he was very active. In 1661 he became commissioner for assessment for Aldeburgh and in 1662 became a JP for Essex and one of the Six Clerks in Chancery. He received a commission for assessment for Essex in 1663. In 1667, he was appointed chairman of the inquiry into the failures of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and presented four reports. Samuel Pepys wrote of him extensively in his diary considering him too young for the chair, \\"and yet he seems to speak very well\\".  Legacy  By his will, written in 1660, Sir Robert left Cockfield Hall and the manors of Yoxford, Cockfield and Marinels to his mother Elizabeth and her heirs absolutely. He entailed his unbequeathed real estate through William Blois's sons Robert, John and Charles Blois, in turn. His executors were Dame Margaret Hungerford (his wife's aunt, sister to Dame Anne Mildmay), Dame Elizabeth Brooke (his mother), Anne Margarett Brooke (his wife) and William Blois, Esq. (his brother-in-law).Will of Sir Robert Brooke (PCC 1670). Dame Anne Margarett however died on 7 January 1666/67, leaving him a daughter. By his codicil of 1667 his manor, messuage, park and rectory advowson of Wanstead were left to his cousin german John Brooke (of Ipswich). Sir Robert went to France in 1669 and was drowned while bathing in the River Rhône at Avignon in June. William Blois alone swore to administer his estate at Probate in December 1669. William Blois succeeded to his own father Sir William the elder, compiler of the \\"Blois MSS\\", in 1673,Farrer, 'The Blois MSS', p. 150. and becoming himself Sir William, died only two years later.Will and Sentence of Sir William Blois of City of London (both P.C.C. 1676, Bence quire). All his elder sons having died, his surviving son Charles (in his father's place) took on the administration of his uncle Sir Robert Brooke's will (Dame Elizabeth Brooke renouncing and the others all being deceased),Will of Robert Brooke (PCC 1670), probate clauses. and in 1683 had control of his father's estate, his stepmother Dame Jane Blois alias Brooke by then having died,Will of John Brooke of Westwood Lodge, Suffolk (P.C.C. 1653, Brent quire), final probate clause. and Dame Elizabeth Brooke dying in that year. He was created 1st Baronet in 1686. Therefore when his aunt Mary Brooke died in 1693 it was as Sir Charles Blois, 1st Baronet that he, and subsequently his heirs, became masters of Cockfield Hall at Yoxford.P. Watson, 'Blois, Sir Charles, 1st Bt. (1657-1738), of Grundisburgh Hall, Suff.', in B.D.

Description  The Suaedoideae have well-developed leaves. Except for genus Bienertia, the leaves show a central and many lateral vascular bundles. The leaves are neither decurrent nor amplexicaul. The inflorescences are axillary cymes. The flowers are sitting free in the axils of bracts, with lateral bracteoles. The perianth consists of 5 tepals, which are more or less fused basally. 5 stamens are present. The seed encloses a spiral embryo, mostly without any perisperm.  Distribution  The Suaedoideae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are important members of the vegetation of shores and salty inland habitats. They are especially common in dry (arid) regions.  Photosynthesis pathway  Among the species of Suaedoideae, there are nearly equal numbers of C3-plants and C4-plants. During the evolution of the subfamily, the C4-photosynthesis pathway seems to have been derived from four independent origins: two times with Kranz C4 anatomy in Suaeda section Salsina and Suaeda section Schoberia. Two independent origins of non-Kranz C4 systems are found in Bienertia and Suaeda section Borszczowia.

Analysis It is considered by several authors as the masterpiece of the Venetian period of El Greco. Despite containing some Cretan elements acquired during his formal training, this painting can be fully considered a work of the Italian Renaissance. Perspective emphasizes the handling of the anatomy, the application of color and drama of the scene. This is a picture of varied influences, from Tintoretto to Michelangelo and Raphael through Paolo Veronese, and other painters of the Cinquecento venetian school. Still, some errors are seen like the absence of a point of view, the difficulty in making complex groups and the lack of experience in modeling figures. Bibliography *Álvarez Lopera, José.

Background In the months before the Bastrop County Complex fire, Texas was affected by a series of wildfires amid several distinct record-breaking meteorological conditions conducive to combustion. During 2011, Texas endured its most severe single-year drought since the 1950s, received the lowest single-year rainfall since 1895, and experienced the hottest June–August period of any U.S. state at any point in time on record – exceeding that of even the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Circumstances were further exacerbated by Tropical Storm Lee, which produced strong winds over the Labor Day weekend, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. Between September 4 and September 6, reports indicated that 63 new fires were started. On September 6, the Texas Forest Service released a statement, describing the fire's behavior as \\"unprecedented\\" and stating that \\"no one on the face of this Earth has ever fought fires in these extreme conditions\\". Timeline A CH-47 Chinook helicopter from the Texas Army National Guard uses a Bambi Bucket to dump water on a blaze near Bastrop on September 6, 2011. On the afternoon of September 4, two fires started near Bastrop State Park: one in the community of Circle D-KC Estates and the other four miles north. Fire officials later stated that the likely cause of the blaze was sparks from electric power lines – 30-mile-per-hour gusts of wind on September 4 apparently toppled trees which tumbled into electrical lines at the two initial locations, creating sparks that fell onto and ignited the dry grass and leaf litter below.\\"State: Power line sparks likely caused Texas blaze\\".

Retrieved February 8, 2013. The high winds quickly spread the fires among the towering loblolly pine trees and the two fires then merged, engulfing 400 homes. A few hours later, a third fire broke out on the south side of Texas State Highway 71 near the Tahitian Village subdivision and merged with the other two. Multiple areas and locales were evacuated, including the Bastrop Animal Shelter, Bastrop State Park (more than half of which was burned), and other communities near the fire. Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative relocated its operations to a backup location and cut power in the area to protect firefighters. Bulldozers and pumpers were deployed to help combat the fire, according to Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald. By early September 6, reports indicated that two lives had been lost, and that the number of destroyed homes had increased to at least 600. Although the winds had calmed, the fire had no containment. Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1 was deployed to the area. By the morning of September 7, the Texas Forest Service reported that 785 homes had been destroyed, with the fire only 30 percent contained. The fire jumped the Colorado River on at least two separate occasions. On the morning of September 8, the number of homes destroyed reached 1,386. Texan officials also reported that they lacked the tanks and pipes necessary to load Tanker 910, a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airtanker, with fire retardant, as well as a qualified aerial firefighting pilot to operate it. Air quality in neighboring Austin reportedly reached 14-year lows due to drifting smoke from the fire. In the evening of September 8, officials announced that they expected Tanker 910 to be in action by the morning of Friday September 9. However, Tanker 910 ultimately did not receive authorisation to combat the Bastrop fire, instead being used to fight a separate wildfire outside Houston. By Sunday, September 11, the fire had reportedly been 50% contained, and some evacuated residents were permitted to return home as firefighting efforts continued. By this point, more than 1,500 homes had been destroyed by the fire.CNN. Retrieved 12 September 2011.\\"Texas firefighters face stiff challenge\\". USA Today. September 12, 2011.

By comparison, the second-most destructive fire on record, in April 2011, destroyed 168 homes, while the third, in December 2005, destroyed 116. Total insured losses caused by the Bastrop fire were estimated at $325 million. =Bastrop State Park= According to Texas Parks & Wildlife officials, only 50–100 acres of the Bastrop State Park's 5,926-acre premises remained undamaged following the wildfire. The fire destroyed two scenic overlooks constructed during the New Deal of the 1930s, as well as the park's vintage Rain Shelter building. =Buescher State Park= Buescher State Park was closed for two weeks due to the wildfire threat, but later reopened. Contrary to earlier reports, a Texas Parks & Wildlife press release reported that the park was untouched by the wildfire. =Houston toad habitat destruction= The endangered Houston toad was believed to have lost the vast majority of its habitat in the fire. =Lost Pines Forest= The Lost Pines Forest, a disjunct population of loblolly pine trees thought to have originated in or before the Pleistocene era, was heavily affected by the fire. Reaction =Political response= In response to the wildfire, Governor of Texas Rick Perry forwent his presidential campaign stop in South Carolina and returned home on Tuesday, September 6, to \\"address the public and organize requests for more federal aid\\". Perry and the Texas Legislature drew criticism over their roles in substantial budget cuts to the Texas Forest Service and volunteer fire departments, both of which the state relies heavily upon for combating wildfires. Mario Gallegos, Jim Dunnam, Kirk Watson, the Center for Public Policy Priorities and others opined that these budget cuts exacerbated conditions. Perry criticized the Obama administration for delays in responding to requests made to FEMA for relief aid. On September 7, 2011, President Barack Obama personally telephoned Perry to discuss the fires. That same day, the White House issued a formal statement, saying that \\"Over the last several days, at the request of the Governor, the Administration has granted eight Fire Management Assistance Grants, making federal funds available to reimburse eligible costs associated with efforts to combat the fires. FEMA is actively working with state and local officials to conduct damage assessments and to identify areas where additional federal assistance may be warranted.\\" =Community and social media efforts= Members of the community were noted for voluntarily working to save several homes from destruction by the wildfire. On September 7, a Facebook page entitled Bastrop Fire - Adopt a Family was created to help match up homeless victims with those willing to help house them or provide other assistance. On September 27, 2011, the Bastrop County Long Term Recovery Team was formed and is credited with the rebuilding of 133 homes in Bastrop County for uninsured and underinsured low income individuals and families who were unable to recover on their own.

Life His father, James Beattie, was educated as an architect and surveyor, but his occupation was that of a builder. He died in an accident in 1809. It has been said that his son inherited from him his classical, and from his mother his poetical, tendencies. The Beatties lived in Dumfriesshire for several generations. When just fourteen he went to school at Clarencefield Academy in Dumfriesshire, and during his stay there of six years, under the rector, Mr. Thomas Fergusson, attained a competent knowledge of Latin, Greek, and French. In 1812 he became a medical student at Edinburgh University, and took his M.D. degree with credit in 1818. He helped to keep himself at the university by undertaking, during a portion of his college course, the mastership of the parochial school at Cleish, Kinross-shire, and other kinds of tuition. Of his university days he says: He remained in Edinburgh for two years after taking his diploma, living chiefly 'out of his inkhorn', teaching, lecturing, translating, and conducting a small private practice. During this period he wrote The Lay of a Graduate, Rosalie, and The Swiss Relic. Afterwards he practised medicine in Cumberland, and in 1822 was in London preparing to settle in Russia. He abandoned this project after becoming engaged to be married to a young lady of fortune, and \\"no inconsiderable attractions\\", Miss Elizabeth Limner. He spent three months in Paris, attending the hospitals, then returned to London, was married in the autumn of 1822. He was about to start a medical practice at Dover when he received a summons from the Duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV), to whom he had been introduced to by Admiral Child, a connection of Mrs. Beattie's, to attend the duke's family on a visit to the courts of Germany. At the end of winter he resumed his studies in Paris, and spent the next two years travelling and studying in Italy, Switzerland, and on the Rhine. At the end of 1824 he entered upon a medical practice at Worthing (the salubrity of whose climate he recommended in a pamphlet published in 1858), but left it in the following March to again accompany the Duke and Duchess of Clarence to Germany. On this occasion, at Göttingen, he made the acquaintance of Blumenbach, of whom he says: He also busied himself in investigating the medicinal properties of the most renowned German spas. While recrossing the Channel in October on the steamer Comet he was nearly wrecked on the Goodwin Sands. On his return to London he published The Heliotrope and The Courts of Germany, which he completed in a new edition in 1838. Early in 1826 for the third time he formed one of the suite of the Duke of Clarence on a German visit, and ingratiated himself with the Queen of Wurtemberg, Princess Royal of Great Britain. When she visited England he was sent for to attend her at Hampton Court and Windsor. He repaid her majesty's good opinion with a flattering memoir of her in 1829. The only recompense Dr. Beattie ever received for all his services to the Duke of Clarence, extending over some fourteen years, including, three years as a private secretary, were a service of silver plate and a letter certifying him to be \\"a perfect gentleman\\". Dr. Beattie, however, appears to have been grateful. The duchess added \\"a pair of bracelets for Mrs. Beattie, knit by her own hands\\", and, after her coronation, a gold medallion, as a mark of her majesty's esteem and regard; while the King of Prussia, whom he had professionally attended, also sent him a gold medallion accompanied by \\"a complimentary autograph letter\\". In 1827, Dr. Beattie was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and established himself in Hampstead, where for eighteen years he enjoyed an extensive practice. In 1836 and 1836 he travelled in Switzerland and in the land of the Waldenses, and in the former year was in Paris at the time of Fieschi's attempt upon the life of Louis-Philippe, and in the immediate vicinity of the explosion. He was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and during this period he published two poems — John Huss and \\"Polynesia\\" — Ports and Harbours of the Danube, and a series of descriptive and historical works, beautifully illustrated by his friend and fellow traveller, the well-known W. H. Bartlett, on \\"Switzerland\\", \\"Scotland\\", \\"The Waldenses\\", Castles and Abbeys of England, and The Danube. He also edited the Scenic Annual, for which the poet Campbell was supposed to be responsible, 'Beckett's Dramatic Works', and Lives of Eminent Conservative Statesmen. Of the Scenic Annual a leading critical journal observed, \\"The name of Campbell is a sufficient pledge for its poetic character\\"; while Beattie, in a memorandum for the year 1838, wrote: \\"Published Scenic Annual by which I gained for Campbell £200 clear; all the pieces, three excepted, are mine\\". Scotland Illustrated passed through several editions, and elicited the acknowledgement from its publisher, Mr. Virtue, 'that the prosperity he had attained was mainly owing to Dr. Beattie's literary assistance'. In 1833, Dr. Beattie was introduced by her biographer, Madden, to the Countess of Blessington, and became her friend. She frequently availed herself of his services as a poetical contributor to her Book of Beauty and other annuals, bestowing upon him in return for his verses 'a large amount of fluent flattery, and a general invitation to Seymour Place for any \\"evenings between ten and half-past twelve\\", a privilege of which Beattie could not avail himself in consequence of the state of his eyes. When Lady Blessington was deserted by many, Beattie remained her firm friend. Madden tells us that \\"the very last letter, a very short time before the crash at Gore House, was one of entreaty for his exertions among the publishers to procure for her 'any kind of literary employment;' and the answer to that application was a letter of pain at the failure of every effort to accomplish her wishes\\". Beattie's relations with Lady Byron also would appear to have been confidential. A friend of Beattie's, whose obituary of him may be found in the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald (24 March 1876), says that Beattie told him that Lady Byron \\"had imparted to him the true reason of her separation from her husband, and that it was not the one given by Mrs. Stowe\\". Dr. Beattie was close with Thomas Campbell, and was selected by the poet as his biographer, an office which he discharged in 1849 by the publication of The Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell, in three volumes. In 1833 Beattie speaks of Campbell as coming to take up his quarters at Rose Villa, Beattie's cottage at Hampstead, where on former occasions he had experienced much benefit, and adds: 'These visits in after life were frequently repeated, and whenever he found himself relapsing into a depressed state of health and sprints, \\"Well,\\" he would say, \\"I must come into hospital,\\" and he would repair for another week to \\"Campbell's Ward,\\" a room so named by the poet in the doctor's house'. In 1842 Campbells Pilgrim of Glencoe appeared, dedicated \\"To William Beattie, M.D., in remembrance of long subsisting and mutual friendship\\". Both as physician and friend Beattie seems to have been the great stay of the poet's declining years. On hearing of Campbell's illness in 1844, Beattie hastened to his bedside at Boulogne, and never left him until all was over. Campbell's cherished wish to find his last resting-place in Westminster Abbey would probably never have been realised but for Beattie, nor would a statue have been placed in 'Poets' Corner' to his memory had Beattie not collected contributions for it, and made good a considerable deficit out of his own pocket. He was also close with Samuel Rogers, who attributed his longevity to the care and vigilance of his physician, and who requested him to perform for him the same sad office Beattie had discharged for Campbell — that of closing his eyes in death. His intercourse with Rogers was, however, far less close than that with Campbell. In 1845 Beattie's wife died, and soon afterwards he gave up regular practice as a physician; but he continued for the rest of his life to give medical advice to clergymen, men of letters, and others without accepting professional fees. He also occupied his time with works of charity. In 1846 he published, for instance, a memoir of his friend Bartlett for the benefit of the artist's family, which raised £400, and through his influence with the prime minister obtained a pension of £76 a year for his widow. This was the last of his systematic literary works, but he continued to contribute papers to the Archæological Society, and to write articles for the reviews. Beattie's only strictly professional work, unless we include his pamphlet on Home Climates and Worthing, was a Latin treatise on pulmonary consumption, the subject of his M.D. thesis at Edinburgh. Some of his works were translated into German and French. He was foreign secretary to the British Archæological Society, fellow of the Ethnological Society, member of the Historical Institute, and of the Institut d'Afrique, Paris. Dr. Beattie lost £7,000 due to the failure of the Albert Assurance office. This was a great shock, and may have accelerated his end; but he bore the loss with manly fortitude, and all he said in reference to it (to a writer in the Medical Times) was that \\"he should be obliged to give up his charitable donations to the amount of £300 a year'. Dr. Beattie's own verdict on his laborious, painstaking, benevolent, and interesting life, \\"Laboriosè vixi nihil agendo\\", is much more modest than correct. He died on 17 March 1875, at 13 Upper Berkeley Street, Portman Square, at the age of eighty-two, and was buried by the side of his wife in Brighton. He had no children. It is understood that he left an autobiography, which has not yet seen the light. His papers are held at the New York Public Library.

Plot John Hare (A.J. Patrick) loses his job after going to the races at work without permission. Despite being married with a child he invests his last shilling in a Tattersall's sweep ticket and draws the favourite. He interviews Dick Fallows (Alf Scarlett), the owner of the favourite, and puts two-thirds of the sweep money with him. The horse wins and after Hare secures the prize money he goes to the Fallows house to celebrate, where he meets Mrs Fallows (Louise Carbasse), Fred Wynne (Godfrey Cass) and some others. Hare plays cards and gets drunk, falling asleep on the couch in the room. A quarrel results between Fallows and Wynne; Fallows winds up killing Wynne with a knife, and then puts the knife in Hare's hand. Hare wakes up, sees the knife and Wynne's corpse and thinks he might have done the murder. Fallows confirms this was the case and suggest he tell his wife (Harrie Ireland) and leave town. Hare does this. Mrs Fallows starts to follow her husband around town and discovers him with another woman. Fallows knocks her down and is about to kill when stopped by the occupants by a passing tram. Hare is tormented by dreams of his wife and child and decides to give himself up so he can see them again. He is arrested by the injured Mrs Fallows, believing herself near death, confesses that Hare was innocent and her husband murdered Wynne. Fallows is arrested while Hare is released, gets his old job back and returns to his family. Reception The film appears to have been well received by the public and critics. When it screened in Adelaide in a rented hall owned by the YMCA, the YMCA ordered removal of a poster advertising it on the grounds that it could be seen to promote gambling. Cast *A.J.

The Luciole is awaiting full approval from the LAA. LAA approval was required as the Luciole's wing loading of 43.5 kg/m2 was too high to benefit from original UK SSDR microlight sub-category. SSDRs (Single Seat De-Regulated) aircraft had to weigh less than without fuel and pilot, and the wing loading could not be more than 10 kg/m2Light Aircraft Association Technical Leaflets Sep 2010 However, the UK CAA changed the rules in May 2014, and the new SSDR rules state that the aircraft must be single seat, and must have an MTOW of 300 kg, i.e. it must weigh no more than 300 kg at takeoff, including pilot and fuel. Also, the stall speed must be 35 knots or less. There are no other design restrictions. In a flight test report, Francis Donaldson, the LAA's Chief Engineer, declared that although some design compromises were \\"clearly not ideal\\", overall he felt \\"very impressed with Michel Colomban's new creation\\", saying the aircraft \\"performed as claimed, was practical and fun\\". Donaldson's major criticism was that the elevator's GRP spring (to provide self-centering and to impart \\"feel\\") was in the cockpit and not in the tail, so that if the elevator control linkage failed, the aircraft could suffer catastrophic lack of pitch-control as \\"the Luciole would most likely be totally unflyable\\".

The station is owned and operated by Communicorp and broadcasts from studios at studios at Spinningfields in Manchester. History The station began test transmissions as 106.1 Rock Radio on FM on 10 April 2008. The transmitter is on top of the City Tower (the former Sunley Building) in Piccadilly in Manchester, the same place as Capital Manchester and Radio X's transmitter and all 3 services share the same broadcast antenna system which is located on the centre transmission tower and is illuminated with red Aircraft warning lights at night. The station organised a 'Free one day festival' to promote its launch, this was held at Cathedral Gardens, with headlining bands Bad Company and Gun with support acts Salford Jets, Letz Zep and Mercury. The performances started at 1:00pm with a countdown to 6:00pm when the station went live. The first voice heard on Rock Radio was the mid-morning presenter Moose. Due to the mix of output, the original application was made under the name Rock Talk. The licence competition included bids by existing licence holders Chrysalis and Emap as well as a number by smaller local groups.Rock Talk Chrysalis Radio's managing director expressed his surprise that the talk/rock hybrid won in preference to a dedicated talk or rock station, both of which had been offered by his group. Following the award, a decision was made to position the station as a sister to the newly relaunched Scottish station 96.3 Rock Radio. The then parent company Guardian Media Group owns the local newspaper Manchester Evening News, a series of local newspapers, a citywide terrestrial and national satellite TV station Channel M and the two regional licences for North West - Real Radio (North West) and Smooth Radio. Real Radio XS logo used until 2016. On 28 July 2011, GMG Radio announced that the Manchester-based service would be re-branded as 106.1 Real Radio XS, while the Glasgow-based 96.3 Rock Radio would be sold and was released that the new Real Radio XS service would \\"benefit from the brand and scale of sister station Real Radio\\".RADIO TODAY - GMG drop Rock Radio for Real Radio XS On 29 August 2011, it was announced that the new service would launch on 5 September 2011 and would be extended to be available over a much larger area, replacing Jazz FM (UK) in London, the North West and the West Midlands, as Jazz FM had been launched nationally via the Digital One DAB platform.RADIO TODAY - Jazz FM leaves regional DAB platforms The move gave the rock service DAB availability in its 106.1 FM coverage area for the first time. Real Radio XS from Manchester was also added to Switch Scotland, replacing 105.2 Smooth Radio, which moved from the regional multiplex to replace Jazz FM on the Bauer Glasgow local multiplex. The Glasgow multiplex also carried the local 96.3 Real Radio XS, meaning DAB listeners in Glasgow could now access both versions. Later, the DAB carriage arrangements would be changed such that the Paisley station transmitted on the Central Scotland multiplex taking the place of the Manchester station; this DAB berth transitioned to Xfm in 2014-15 in line with the 96.3 FM service. On 25 June 2012 it was announced Global Radio had bought GMG Radio,GMG Radio sold to Global for £50m Mark Sweeney, The Guardian, 25 June 2012Global Radio seals £50m purchase of GMG Radio Maisie McCabe, Media Week, 25 June 2012 The division continued to operate separately until 2014 when, following Ofcom's regulatory review into GMG Radio's takeover, Global Radio announced that 106.1 Real Radio XS would be one of eight stations it would be selling to Communicorp. In March 2016, the station was rebranded as XS Manchester. In May 2017, XS moved from Salford to new studios at the XYZ building in the Spinningfields district of Manchester City Centre. The station shares facilities with sister station Smooth North West and two Global-owned stations, Heart North West and Capital Manchester. In December 2019, it was reported that Communicorp had sought permission from Ofcom to change the station format, which if approved would lead to the closure of XS, and Global’s Capital XTRA service being broadcast on 106.1FM in Manchester.

In some species there is a single member of this family which gives the mature product mir-33. In humans there are two members of this family called mir-33a and mir-33b, which are located in intronic regions within two protein-coding genes for Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-2 and SREBP-1) respectively. Function miR-33 plays a role in lipid metabolism; it downregulates a number of ABC transporters, including ABCA1 and ABCG1, which in turn regulate cholesterol and HDL generation. Further related roles of miR-33 have been proposed in fatty acid degradation and in macrophage response to low-density lipoprotein. It has been suggested that miR-33a and miR-33b regulates genes Involved in fatty acid metabolism and insulin signalling. Potential binding sites for mir-33 have been identified in the cDNA of tumour suppressor p53. Further, study has shown that miR-33 is able to repress p53 expression and p53-induced apoptosis. This function is thought to be related to hematopoietic stem cell renewal. Applications miR-33, along with miR-122, could be used to diagnose or treat conditions related to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.

In the sense that the purpose of precise attribution is to extend the scholarly convention of giving citation credit, the provenance of a piece of scholarship (observation or data deposition) is recognized to give credit and priority to a preceding author. Microattribution is thus defined as \\"a scholarly contribution smaller than a journal article being ascribed to a particular author\\" or a small scholarly contribution being ascribed to a particular author. Of course, since data accessions can describe contributions that can vastly exceed research articles in size and quality, quantum attribution or precise citation might be better terms. Barend Mons and Jan Velterop proposed nanopublications for single, attributable and machine- readable assertions in scientific literature. Origin The concept was introduced in a February 2007 blog post \\"Duke of URL\\" by Myles Axton. \\"In the interests of giving credit to the resources geneticists find most useful, here are the numbers of papers citing the most frequently cited links.\\" The term was first used in an April 2007 editorial published in Nature Genetics. \\"[The Human Variome Project] will need to introduce publishing innovations at both ends of the citation spectrum. It will need to track the citation of each variant's accession code in papers, database entries and across the web. This closing of the online publication loop might be termed microattribution.\\" Subsequent editorials and blog posts elaborated the idea that the provenance of data accession codes was inseparable from the data and could be used to give credit to the contributors. \\"Accession numbers to database entries are routinely used for data retrieval. They should now also be used to accrue quantitative credit for their authors in a systematic process of microattribution.\\" An example of the value of microattributions can be seen in the description of genetic variation. A paper published in Nature Genetics paper in March 2011 concluded that microattribution demonstrably increased the reporting of human variants, leading to a comprehensive online resource for systematically describing human genetic variation. A paper on microattribution and nanopublication as means to incentivize the placement of human genome variation data into the public domain was published in June 2012.

The building incorporates a battlemented tower with an octagonal corner turret. History It was built between 1831 and 1836 on the site of an earlier house to a design by George Webster for Thomas Greene, M.P.. On Greenes death in 1872 it passed to his eldest son, Army Officer Dawson Cornelius Greene (1822–87), who retired to live in London and was succeeded by his son, Henry Dawson Dawson-Greene. In 1887 the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin arranged alterations, including a billiard room, another staircase, and a garden loggia. The drawing room and dining room were remodelled in Georgian style in the 1930s. Henry died in 1912 at Whittington leaving two daughters, Mary Sybil and Violet Margaret (died 1988) (who married Thomas Anson, 4th Earl of Lichfield).

Unlike other glutaredoxins, glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) cannot reduce ribonucleotide reductase. Grx2 has significantly higher catalytic activity in the reduction of mixed disulphides with glutathione (GSH) compared with other glutaredoxins. The active site residues (Cys9-Pro10-Tyr11-Cys12, in Escherichia coli Grx2, which are found at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains are identical to other glutaredoxins, but there is no other similarity between glutaredoxin 2 and other glutaredoxins. Grx2 is structurally similar to glutathione-S-transferases (GST), but there is no obvious sequence similarity. The inter-domain contacts are mainly hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains are unlikely to be stable on their own. Both domains are needed for correct folding and activity of Grx2. It is thought that the primary function of Grx2 is to catalyse reversible glutathionylation of proteins with GSH in cellular redox regulation including the response to oxidative stress. These enzymes are not related to GLRX2.

Only part of the film survives today. Synopsis After her father's death, socialite Elaine Fleetwood promises to marry a man she does not love. However, she leaves him at the altar during a wedding ceremony, cuts her hair and decides to disguise herself as a boy and go prospecting in northwest Tasmania. She meets a handsome miner who figures out she is a woman, saves her from a villain and marries her.

She and her husband helped set up a company, Louise Lovely Productions, worth £30,000. Among her backers were several businessmen who worked with Arthur Shirley's Pyramid Pictures. They constructed an elaborate £3,000 studio which contained several large sets, and shot on location at Flemington Racecourse and in Tasmania. This caused to budget to spiral. The sets were used to film a storm in the Tasmanian rain forest. Reception The film was well attended at first, being seen by an estimated 350,000 people in Melbourne and 9,000 in Hobart. However it was unable to recover its costs. Lovely partly attributed to this to the amount of money taken by distributors and exhibitors – she claimed that in one week in Melbourne the film took £1,565 out of which the producers received £382. Lovely subsequently retired from filming and divorced Welch.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 129.'Louise Lovely', Department of Premier and Cabinet, Tasmanian Government Reconstruction Only two minutes of the film were thought to have survived, along with stills taken during shooting. However using photographic reconstruction, newly found footage, animation and a copy of the original novel annotated by Lovely, archivists have manage to reconstruct 20 minutes of the film.

Internationally pulmonary scientists have many different titles, such as: pulmonary function technologist, respiratory scientist, pulmonary scientist, cardiopulmonary specialist and in some places registered respiratory therapists are also used in the role of pulmonary scientists. A physician in respiratory science is generally referred to as a physician in their title (i.e. Respiratory Physician-Scientist). Respiratory science is a diminishing field of study and research even though the increase in respiratory related disease is increasing. International Pulmonary Science =Australia= In Australia there is no register or licensure for Respiratory Care, there is however the Certified Respiratory Function Scientist (CRFS) credential. Australian respiratory therapy is done by physiotherapists who have further specialized in cardiopulmonary therapeutics and the scope not covered by physiotherapists are managed by specialized respiratory nurses. The term Respiratory Scientist is used to describe the profession which is limited to Pulmonary Function Testing. Though there is no official credentialing required, university degrees are required to practice. Respiratory Function Scientist ;Certified Respiratory Function Scientist (CRFS) The Respiratory Scientist is involved in all aspects of respiratory function assessment including patient testing, interpretation of test results, maintenance of equipment, development / evaluation of new methods and quality assurance. The Respiratory Scientist may work unsupervised in core areas and provide training to trainee scientists in these areas under the direction of a senior Respiratory Scientist. Minimum education requirements for the CRFS credential is a BSc in Respiratory Physiology and Science but more likely a Masters or PhD in Respiratory Science. Australian credentialing is maintained by the Australian & New Zealand Society of Respiratory Science.

According to Boeke, \\"These three aspects are interdependent and in this connection typify a society, in this way that a prevailing social spirit and the prevailing forms of organisation and of technique give the society its style, its appearance, so that in their interrelation they may be called the social system, the social style or the social atmosphere of that society \\".  The dual society  According to Boeke, it is not necessary that a society be dominated exclusively by one social system. If one social system does prevail, the society in question is a homogeneous society. When, on the contrary two (or more) social systems appear simultaneously, we have a dual society. Boeke qualifies the term dual society by using it only for societies \\"showing a distinct cleavage of two synchronic and full grown social styles which in the normal, historical evolution of homogeneous societies are separated from each other by transitional forms, as for instance, pre-capitalism and high capitalism by early capitalism.\\" This qualification is necessary because every society going through the process of evolution or endogenic social progression shows besides the prevailing social systems, the remains of the preceding and the beginnings of its future social style. If, on the other hand, one social system is imported from abroad and this system fails to oust or assimilate the prevailing social system, a dual society obviously exists. On this account Boeke defines a dual society as a society where \\"one of the two prevailing social systems, as a matter of fact always the most advanced, will have been imported from abroad and have gained its existence in the new environment without being able to oust or assimilate the divergent social system that has grown up there, with the result that neither of them becomes general and characteristic for that society as a whole.\\"  Characteristics of a dualistic economy  ;Overriding importance of social needs The first characteristic of dualistic economies pointed out by Boeke is the relatively greater importance of social needs as compared to western economies. Boeke states, \\"Possessions in the share of cattle, land, clothes, and houses, the fulfilment of social duties in all the circumstances of like, must be all regarded as largely the satisfaction of social needs. It is not their economic usefulness, not the individual services they render their possessor which determine the value of the goods. It is a matter of secondary importance whether the land produces reasonable profit in proportion to the money paid for it whether the cattle can be made reasonably useful to their owner in his own business, whether the clothing covers, protects, warms the wearer or affects him pleasantly in any way. For it is not the use of these objects to the subject himself that gives them their worth in his eyes; it is what the community thinks of them that sets the standard.\\"  Criticism  The social dualism theory has been criticized by Benjamin Higgins on the following grounds: # The Wants Are Not Limited: If we analyse “Indonesia’s life” we do not find that the desires of the people are limited because here the values of MPC and MPM are higher. This is the reason that the government has to impose import restrictions. Moreover, whenever the harvest is good, farmers become prosperous and the demand for luxurious goods rises. # Casual Labor Are Not Unorganized: Boeke presented the version that casual workers are unorganized and passive. This may be true as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, but they are not unorganized in coffee, tea, rubber and plantation etc. # Eastern Labor Is Not Immobile: Boeke thought that eastern labor is immobile. It is not so because of attraction of modern facilities of life in the urban areas. Moreover, the high income incentives force the labor to move from rural areas to urban areas. # Dualistic Theory Is Not Particular To Under Developed Countries Only: The eastern society, according to Boeke, only exists in under-developed countries. It is not true. It does exist in Canada, Italy and even in the United States. # Applicability To Western Society: According to Professor Higgins most of the characteristics of eastern society given by Boeke are present even in western societies. For example, during hyperinflation, speculation is preferred to investment. This means people in the western countries also have a strong desire to keep their capital safe and in liquid form. The western society also believes in conspicuous consumption as discussed by veblin and snob effects. The backward bending supply curve of efforts has been experienced by Australia during post war period and by US in the fifties. # Not A Theory But A Description: It is objected that the Boeke’s dualistic theory is merely a description rather than a theory. His findings are based upon neoclassical theory which has limited applicability in the western world. # Does Not Provide Solution To The Problem Of Unemployment: Boeke’s dualism centers more on sociocultural aspects rather on economic. He only says that government is not in a position to remove unemployment. Moreover, he does not mention the situation of under-employment. Therefore, his theory is full of shortcomings. Higgins argues that the main issue in dualistic economies is to provide employment opportunities and Boeke's theory fails to do it and has developed the theory of Technological dualism as a response.

Morosoni was born in Venice and was a member of the illustrious Morosini family who played a significant role in the history of the city. At least one Morosini was elected as a Doge of Venice. Little more is known of his personal life, other than that he became a Benedictine monk at the famous Monastery of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa in the eastern Pyrenees of southern France. It was a major center of monastic reform during the 10th century. In AD 982 Morosoni returned to his native city and requested of the current Doge, Tribuno Memmo, that the island of San Giorgio Maggiore be granted to him for the establishment of a monastery there. Memmo granted his request and filled in more land on the island to provide the foundations for the monastic complex. He died in 1012. His cultus was never formally approved, but for centuries he has been traditionally referred to as \\"Blessed\\" within the Benedictine Order. His feast day is observed on February 5.

The bacterium is a facultatively anaerobic, small, motile, gram negative, straight rod with flagella. Infection causes Edwardsiella septicemia (also known as ES, edwardsiellosis, emphysematous putrefactive disease of catfish, fish gangrene, and red disease) in channel catfish, eels, and flounder. Edwardsiella tarda is also found in largemouth bass and freshwater species such as rainbow trout. It is a zoonosis and can infect a variety of animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Edwardsiella tarda has also been the cause of periodic infections for various animals within zoos. E. tarda has a worldwide distribution and can be found in pond water, mud, and the intestine of fish and other marine animals. It is spread by carrier animal feces. History The creation of the species was suggested by Ewing and colleagues in 1965 in order to cover 37 different strains that mainly were found in fecal materials. Japanese and other scientists were also observing similar bacterium to these and eventually the bacterium were divided into two groups called the Asakusa and Bartholomew groups. Edwardsiella tarda was established as a legitimate genus and species through studies at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research by Don Brenner. The genus Edwardsiella was named after P. R. Edwards in 1965. Since 1965, strains isolated from fish showing similar biochemical profiles based on the commonly used biochemical tests were identified as Edwardsiella tarda. However it is in 2013, nearly after half a century, that Dr Abayneh and colleagues at Norwegian School of Veterinary science unravelled the wide genetic divergence between strains from fish and that of humans using contemporary genetic characterization methods. These two groups were also known to show phenotypic differences in pathogenicity to fish and in their biochemical profiles in substrates that were not used in routine tests. This led to the description of two novel species from fish viz Edwardsiella piscicida (Abayneh et al., 2013) and Edwardsiella anguillarum (Shao et al. 2015) that were previously mis-classified as E. tarda. This might have addressed the arguments between the Japanese and American investigators with regard to the difficulty of differentiating isolates from fish and humans by the time and ended up classifying all into same species i.e. Edwardsiella tarda. Distribution Edwardsiella tarda is widely distributed throughout the world. It has been found from the water in Japan all the way to the United States. In Japan it was present in the Japanese eel and in some of the Japanese snakes. In the United States it was reported to be found in human feces. Clinical signs and diagnosis Infection can cause organomegaly, ocular disease, rectal prolapse, ecchymosis, and erosions on the skin, inflammation of the gills, oedema, ascites, abnormal behavior, and haemorrhage throughout the body. On postmortem fish they are normally pale with widespread petechial haemorrhage and abscessation. On catfish, lesions will develop into deep abscesses filled with gas and necrotic substances. It can cause a variety of signs in humans including gastroenteritis, meningitis and peritonitis. A presumptive diagnosis may be made based on the history, clinical signs, and autopsy findings. However E. tarda can be cultured on specific growth mediums such as brain-heart infusion agar and techniques such as indirect fluorescent antibody testing, ELISA and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can be used to confirm diagnosis Treatment and control Antibiotics should be used to treat infected fish. Control of the disease is achieved by vaccination. There are three vaccine types and they should all be administered by water bath. Chemotherapy has also been used in the past in order to avoid disease. Management factors such as reducing stress and stocking density can help prevent disease along with maintaining suitable sanitation of water. Other stress factors include drastic changes in temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen levels in the water. In order to manage properly for edwardsiellosis water must be checked constantly in order to keep fish stocks completely free of pathogens. Current research Some of the most recent research done on Edwardsiella tarda was performed by Griffin et al. (2013) to assess what the literature refers to as \\"the intra-specific variability of E. tarda isolates from 4 different fish species in the eastern United States.\\" These intra- specific variations that they were looking for occur in other parts of the world where E. tarda is found and they were hoping to discover how similar levels may be in the United States. This could offer scientists a \\"baseline for the development of more reliable molecular diagnostic tools.\\" The study found that two distinct genotypes do exist within E. tarda but does state that it's completely possible that there are more. This study will be used to improve the accuracy of \\"molecular diagnostics to better understand the role these genetically distinct E. tarda groups play in fish health.\\" See also * Edwardsiella ictaluri * Type VI secretion system References *'Edwardsiella tarda, reviewed and published by WikiVet at http://en.wikivet.net/Edwardsiella_tarda, accessed 06/09/2011.

A general store owner challenges him to a horse race, but his rider's fiancée, Roxana Reil, gives a helpful tip to Starbuck on how to win the race. A romantic attraction develops and Roxana's father advises her not to marry a man she doesn't love. Roxana sets sail for France, however, and her boat is attacked by pirates, who kill her father and take Roxana captive in Morocco, making her a slave. Starbuck pursues her. He is introduced by a U.S. consul to the sultan, who is impressed with Starbuck's rifle marksmanship. He is offered a position with the sultan's infantry and given a slave of his own, Lilith. Roxana has been sold to Omar Id-Din, who could be plotting against the sultan. Starbuck challenges Omar to a duel, with the winner acquiring the other's rifle and slave. Starbuck wins and intends to return home with Roxana, but they are betrayed by the jealous Lilith, who fights Roxana and tells Omar of their plans. Starbuck is taken prisoner. Lilith has a change of heart, however, and changes clothes with Roxana to fool the guards. With the help of Hassan Sendar, one of the sultan's soldiers, they help rescue Starbuck, who leads the escape of other prisoners. He throws Omar from a roof. He and Roxana are free, and, as a reward, Hassan is given a new slave, Lilith. Jeff Chandler recorded the song I Should Care on Brunswick Records from the film.

It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site of the Old City of Bern and the tower is a Cultural Property of National Significance. The original tower was built as a gate house during the second expansion of Bern in 1256. The tower was demolished in 1640 and completely rebuilt immediately thereafter. History Map of Bern's three medieval guard towers, from left to right: Christoffelturm (now destroyed), Käfigturm, Zytglogge East side of the Käfigturm with Anna Seiler fountain The first tower, which stood on the site of the present Käfigturm, was built in 1256 during the second expansion of Bern. Over the nearly seventy years since the construction of the Zytglogge tower and the first city walls, Bern had expanded westward along the Aare peninsula. In 1255, construction began on a second set of walls, which required a new gatehouse. The new tower was very similar to the original Zytglogge. It was built as a hollow square and most of the back of the tower was open to the city. It had a small, flat platform at the top and a gate that opened onto the bridge over the moat. Following the third city expansion in 1345, the tower became a second line of defense. In 1405, a fire destroyed most of the city of Bern. After the fire, the town's prison was moved from the Zytglogge tower west to the Käfigturm, which was then known as the nüwe kefyen. The name was quickly shortened to kebie, from which the name Käfigturm (literally cage or jail tower) came. After the armory tower was converted into a women's prison, the Käfigturm was known as Mannenkefi. By 1433, the tower was also serving as a watch and signal tower in addition to a prison. By 1470, it had been modified with niches on the city side and merlons around the top platform. At some point between 1470 and 1549, a hip roof was added to the top of the tower. According to a drawing by Gregorius Sickinger, the original tower stood about east of its current location. On 19 May 1638, a commission was appointed by the city council to replace the dilapidated Mannerkefi tower. The old tower was demolished in 1640 and on 29 May 1641, the town council approved plans to build a new tower which would stand slightly to the west of the old tower. In April 1642, one of the chief builders, Joseph Plepp, died. The other chief builder, Antoni Graber, took full control of the project. On 20 January 1643, the exterior work was complete and Graber handed the project over to master carpenter Hans Stähli to finish the roof and the interior woodwork.Hofer, pg. 130 By the spring of 1644, most of the interior work was finished. During the planning phase, the commission determined that the new Käfigturm would not be large enough to close the several prisons around Bern and move them all into the new tower. In February 1641, the town council acquired the house of the recently deceased widow of Hans Gunier, which lay just south of the new tower. The house was rebuilt from the ground up as part of the prison by Antoni Graber. Once Graber finished the exterior work on the house, the interior was built in 1643/44 by Niclaus Bovet.Hofer, pg. 131 During the winter of 1690-91, the first modifications were made to the tower. A clock face was added on the front and back of the middle of the tower. The decorative Corbels and triglyphs and a window in the middle section of the tower were all removed to add the clock. The current clock tower bell was added to the tower in 1643. The history of the bell is a bit unusual. When the town decided to add a bell, the Thirty Years War was still raging in Europe. Due to the war, it was very difficult to buy metal to cast a bell. So, the town council chose to buy a bell that had been captured near Vesoul and was being shipped as war booty to Freiburg. Until the end of the 17th Century, the bell was struck by hand. The mechanism to ring the bells automatically was installed in 1691-92. The tower remained virtually unchanged over the following centuries, though the attached house was renovated and gained two additional stories between 1794 and 1805. In 1903 and 1933 the west facade of the tower was renovated. The east facade was renovated in 1906. To ease traffic congestion, a second walkway was cut through the house north of the tower in 1886. Then, in 1902-3 a large gate was built through the ground floor cell block of the prison. The 60 to 70 prisoners that had been housed in the tower, were moved to the district prison north of the main post office building in 1897. Removing the prisoners and demolishing the cells changed the role of the tower. It became an archive tower and stored the state archives of the canton and the records of the supreme court.Hofer, pg. 132 For a time a portion of the basement served as a warehouse of the adjacent Garnier wine shop.History of the Käfigturm accessed 7 September 2011 After minor renovations in 1906 on the east facade and on the west facade in 1933, in 1976 the Grand Council of the Canton of Bern approved a total renovation. The renovation included an expansion into an information and exhibition center. The information center finally opened on 19 April 1980 and remained open for the next 15 years. After the information center closed it was temporarily used as a commercial library and sporadically hosted exhibitions, private parties or meetings. Eventually, the federal government established the tower as a meeting place for the Polit-Forum (Political Forum of the Confederation) an organization of people who were interested in discussing politics. Tower site East side of the Käfigturm, before the portal was driven through the neighboring building and with the rectangular stair house. The tower is a square with sides. The portal through the tower is and the base is thick. The bottom of the roof is above the street, and the pennant at the top of the tower is high. Most of the tower is built out of sandstone.Hofer, pg. 133 The roof features five early baroque towers. The four smaller towers are exact copies of each other and are placed at the centers of the four sides of the tower. The central tower is larger, but retains all the features of the four smaller towers. They all feature a pair of rectangular windows, a copper-plated pointed roof and a pennant. The clock works are built into the attic floor of the tower.Hofer, pg. 134-8 On the east side, in the corner of the 1641 neighboring building and the tower, is a three sided stair house which was built in 1903. The neighboring building is four stories tall above a round top portal. The current appearance of this prison building comes from 1805–06, except for the portal which was run through the old ground floor prison in 1903.

He is best known as the designer of the Pistolet automatique modèle 1935A (also known as the Modèle 1935A, French Model 1935A, or M1935A).  Biography  Born in Lavey-Morcles, Petter studied mechanical engineering in Bern and was a lieutenant in the infantry of the Swiss Army. He became an employee of Krupp in Essen, Germany. During World War I, he served in the French Foreign Legion, where he obtained French citizenship and the rank of captain. Petter received two French decorations, the Croix de Guerre and membership in the Legion of Honour. He was made a French citizen by presidential decree in 1916. Subsequently, he was director of the French branch of the Belgian company Armes Automatiques Lewis and consultant of the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM) in Cholet. = Private life = Petter was married twice, in 1909 to Louise Marguerite Paule Charavet, and in 1926 to Xenia Schegloff. His second marriage produced two daughters, Elizabeth and Hélène. He died in Montreux in 1953.  Petter- Browning system  French Model 1935A pistol The Petter-Browning system (alternately the Browning-Petter or Browning-Petter-SIG system) of breechblocks is named after John Browning and Petter. Petter designed the French Model 1935A pistol, which had some of the same design elements as Browning's M1911 pistol, such as the grooved slide and barrel which interlocked and recoiled together until a pivoting link lowered the barrel, thus unlocking the assembly and further rearward movement of the barrel and slide together, which after reaching the point of greatest movement would be returned to battery. Along the way, the slide would strip a cartridge from the magazine and push it into the chamber just prior to the under barrel link forcing the barrel up into engagement with the slide, locking the action. Petter eliminated the barrel bushing and used a full length spring guide which had the effect of removing some of the inaccuracy from the M1911 design and increased functional reliability. A unique feature of the system was an integrated fire control system. The trigger, hammer, mainspring, and sear assembly were contained in one unit. His design impressed SIG of Switzerland, who licensed it in order to produce their model 47/8 handgun, which became the SIG Sauer P210. Petter's French patent (Swiss: , ) was acquired in 1937 by SIG and used for the P210.

It was written in Bermuda in June 1980, after several attempts by Lennon to call his wife, Yoko Ono, who remained in New York. The song is also available on the 1982 compilation The John Lennon Collection, the 1998 boxset John Lennon Anthology, the one disc compilation Wonsaponatime, the 2005 two disc compilation Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon and in 2010 for the Gimme Some Truth album. The song was also featured in the 2005 musical Lennon. Lyrics and music Lennon completed \\"I'm Losing You\\" in 1980 while in Bermuda after trying to call wife Yoko Ono but not being able to get through. His annoyance became a jumping off point for a deeper examination of the state of his marriage. The lyrics acknowledge that the relationship is in trouble, and Lennon admits that he has hurt his wife, but he also resents the fact that she won't let him live down his mistakes. He also claims that those mistakes occurred long ago. According to pop historian Robert Rodriguez, the candidness of Lennon's exploration of his feelings give the song a potency that recalls songs from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Walls and Bridges. Music critic Johnny Rogan also sees similarities with songs written during his mid-70s separation from Yoko Ono, when many the Walls and Bridges songs were written. And Lennon has confirmed that although the song was originally inspired by his feelings over the phone call, it also expresses his feelings about losing Yoko Ono during their 18-month separation (i.e., his lost weekend) as well as other losses, including the loss of his mother, which was the subject of several songs on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The opening line in the song has the singer wondering why he went to the room of a \\"stranger\\" for comfort. It is left ambiguous whether the stranger is someone other than his lover, or whether the stranger is actually his lover, to whom he has become so alienated that she seems like a stranger. In another line, \\"do you still have to carry that cross?\\", the singer uses The Passion as a metaphor for his lover's refusal to forgive him. Another line from the song is \\"here in the valley of indecision/I don't know what to do\\". This is a reference to the title of the 1945 movie The Valley of Decision. Shortly after writing the song, Lennon explained to son Sean that he was often indecisive as a result of the pain he suffered when having to choose which parent to live with when his parents separated. Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish say that the \\"big\\" drum sound and guitar part help create a \\"tense atmosphere\\", and liken the drum sound to production styles that became common later in the decade. An earlier version of the song was entitled \\"Stranger's Room\\". According to rock journalist Paul Du Noyer, \\"Stranger's Room\\" was written in 1978. Recording Lennon recorded an early demo version of \\"I'm Losing You\\" in July 1980. This version, part of which appeared on The Lost Lennon Tapes, was played on acoustic guitar with a drum machine, and Lennon overdubbed additional guitar and vocal parts. Producer Jack Douglas originally suggested that Lennon use Cheap Trick as the backing band to play on the song. A version was recorded on 12 August 1980 with Cheap Trick's guitarist Rick Nielsen and drummer Bun E. Carlos backing Lennon. They also recorded a version of Yoko Ono's \\"I'm Moving On\\", which is a companion piece to \\"I'm Losing You\\". Lennon was impressed enough with their performance that Lennon told Carlos that he wished Nielsen had been his 2nd guitarist for \\"Cold Turkey\\", but ultimately this version was not included on Double Fantasy (nor was the Cheap Trick-backed version of \\"I'm Moving On\\".) Possible reasons for their exclusions are that Cheap Trick's management may have wanted too much money, or that Lennon believed that the performances were more \\"heavy\\" than he wanted. However, when the Double Fantasy version of \\"I'm Losing You\\" was recorded, the version with Cheap Trick's backing was played through the session musicians' headphones to help inspire their performances. The Cheap Trick version was eventually released on John Lennon Anthology, albeit without an overdubbed guitar part played by Nielsen. \\"I'm Losing You\\" was first recorded with the Double Fantasy session musicians on 18 August 1980, but Lennon was dissatisfied with this performance, and thus a third recording was made on 26 August, which was released on Double Fantasy. A horn arrangement was overdubbed on 5 September, but this was ultimately deleted from the released version of the song. Lennon's vocal was recorded on 22 September. Reception At one point, \\"I'm Losing You\\" was planned as a single, but after Lennon's murder it was shelved as being \\"eerily inappropriate\\". Nonetheless, what appears to be a single edit was made, fading the Double Fantasy version early to avoid the crossfade to \\"I'm Moving On\\", and which appears to have been used for the compilation albums The John Lennon Collection and Lennon. Stickers on the Double Fantasy record album emphasised the inclusion of \\"I'm Losing You\\". In 1998, Capitol Records issued \\"I'm Losing You\\" as part of a two-track promotional CD, backed with Lennon's recording of \\"Only You\\", to promote the John Lennon Anthology album. The CD was issued catalogue number LENNON 001. A promotional film was also made for this version, with Nielsen, Carlos and Levin miming their performances. The film incorporated animations of drawings Lennon had made. Rogan considers \\"I'm Losing You\\" to be one of the best songs on Double Fantasy. Author Scott Walker calls \\"I'm Losing You\\" Lennon's \\"best composition of 1980\\". Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer considers \\"I'm Losing You\\" to be proof \\"that Double Fantasy is a work of greater emotional complexity than many of its critics are prepared to admit\\", and gives lie to the notion that Lennon and Ono used the album to \\"paint a falsely benign portrait of their marriage\\". Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish call \\"I'm Losing You\\" the \\"toughest\\" song on Double Fantasy. However, they lament that it could have been even tougher had the Cheap Trick version been used. Of the Cheap Trick version released on Anthology they claim that \\"the take is quite good, and without the production gloss of the album, it roars without sounding incomplete, making it an obvious highlight of the 1998 collection\\". Cover versions Cheap Trick themselves covered \\"I'm Losing You\\" on their 2001 album Silver. Murray Head covered it on his 2002 album Passion. Colin James covered the song on his 2003 album Traveler. Corinne Bailey Rae covered the song on the 2007 charity album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur.

He wears number 1. Dreckman began his career in as a National League umpire, but has umpired in both Major Leagues since . Prior to reaching the MLB, Dreckman umpired in the Appalachian League, Midwest League, Carolina League, Southern League, and American Association. Dreckman has worked the 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011 National League Division Series, the 2009 and 2013 National League Championship Series, and the 2010 All-Star Game. Dreckman was among the 54 umpires who were part of the 1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation, a labor negotiating tactic that backfired when the major leagues accepted 22 of the resignations (and allowed others to be rescinded). Dreckman was among those who lost his job, and did not return to the major league diamond as an arbiter until being rehired in 2002. He was the first base umpire for Roy Halladay's no-hitter in Game 1 of the 2010 NLDS and the home plate umpire for Francisco Liriano's no-hitter in 2011. Dreckman represented the MLB in the 2006 Japan All-Star Series, and worked the Miami round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He also was the first base umpire who, on May 13, 2010, called San Francisco Giants catcher Eli Whiteside safe on a bang-bang play at first base after Whiteside hit a line drive off the side of San Diego Padres pitcher Mat Latos. The hit would wind up being the only hit or walk Latos allowed in the game, as an error was committed by second baseman Lance Zawadzki but the error would not have happened because it occurred while trying to complete a double play, something that would have been impossible if Whiteside had been called out. The Padres are the only team in MLB history to have never thrown a no-hitter, let alone a perfect game. Replays, however, seem to indicate that Dreckman had made the correct call by calling Whiteside safe. Dreckman was the third base umpire on July 30, 2017 when Adrián Beltré of the Texas Rangers got his 3000th career hit against the Baltimore Orioles.

It lives in the eastern United States and in a small portion of southern Ontario, Canada, in three distinct populations. Preferred habitats are shaded wetlands (woodland or coastal swamps, marshes, and ditches), with various species of sedge plants it uses as host plants for its larvae.  Description  They have short, rounded wings with a wingspan of . The wings of both sexes are deep brown on top, and the underside of the hindwings are light brown with pale yellow rays. They are similar in appearance to other Euphyes, but \\"the single yellowish streak on the hindwing beneath is unmistakable.\\" Females are slightly larger than males and have a hindwing band with two to three pale yellow spots, while males have a black stigma on the forewing. Caterpillars have a light green body with black head. For male genitalia have \\"five toothed processes at the terminus of the aedoeagus.\\" = Naming = The species was named for W. C. Dukes of Mobile, Alabama, in Arthur Ward Lindsey's original 1923 description of the species, \\"in acknowledgment of his unselfish efforts to advance our knowledge of the Lepidoptera of Alabama.\\" The first specimen was collected by Dukes on August 6, 1922, in Mobile County, Alabama.  Distribution  Dukes' skipper is found in scattered locations around the eastern United States and a small portion of southeastern Canada. There are three distinct regionally clustered populations: * Along the Atlantic Coast from southeastern Virginia to northern peninsular Florida. * The lower Mississippi Valley from central Missouri and southern Illinois south to the Gulf Coast. * Extreme southwestern Ontario, southeastern Michigan, northeastern Indiana, and northern Ohio. Its full distribution consists of the Canadian province of Ontario and the following US states: Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. The split distribution between coastal plains and the Great Lakes area is unusual for North American butterflies, and it is hypothesized that it may be due to population displacements during the Pleistocene glacial intervals, followed by dispersal through the vegetational corridors of the Mississippi and Mohawk valleys when the ice sheets retreated.  Life cycle  Eggs are laid singly under the leaves of the host plants on which the larvae feed. Larvae molt several times and diapause to overwinter in their fourth instar, feed again and molt once more in the spring, then pupate for about two weeks before emerging as adults. Its adult lifespan is estimated at three weeks, and its total lifespan from hatching is about a year or less.  Broods  The species ranges from univoltine in the north to trivoltine in the south, with flight periods lasting approximately one month. In northern populations, the species typically has a single brood around July. From western Kentucky and Virginia southward, it has one brood around June and a second brood around August to September. In Florida, the subspecies E. dukesi calhouni may have more than two broods, from mid-May through October.  Food  Host plants used by larva are restricted to various sedges of the genera Carex and Rhynchospora. These include hairy sedge Carex lacustris in the north (particularly in shaded wetlands, including coastal swamps and ditches), shoreline sedge Carex hyalinolepis in the south (Mississippi River basin), false hop sedge Carex lupuliformis, Carex walteriana, Walter's sedge (Carex striata) in the southeast, narrowfruit horned beaksedge (Ryncospora inundata), and millet beaksedge (Rynchospora miliacea) in Florida. Adults feed on flower nectar of various plants including buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata), Joe-Pye weed (Eupatorium maculatum), blue mistflower (Eupatorium coelestinum), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), hibiscus species (Hibiscus), sneezeweed (Helenium autumnale), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and red clover (Trifolium pratense). Subspecies There are two subspecies of Euphyes dukesi: the nominate subspecies discovered in 1922, and a swamp-dwelling Florida subspecies discovered in 1995. *Euphyes dukesi dukesi Lindsey, 1923: \\"Occurs from the Lake Erie region south mostly through the Ohio and Mississippi drainages to Louisiana, and disjunctly on the Atlantic coastal plain from Virginia to Georgia.\\" *Euphyes dukesi calhouni Shuey, 1996: Allopatric with E. dukesi dukesi, this subspecies occurs in the southern US coastal plain, and is endemic to Florida. It lives in swamp habitats with large stands of sedge host plants (primarily Rhynchospora inundata). The divergence of two subspecies may have occurred due to isolation of Florida and other populations during the Wisconsinian glaciation or an earlier glacier event, with boreal forests acting as barriers. E. d. calhouni is named after its discoverer John Calhoun, and Shuey proposed the common name Florida swamp skipper to emphasize its endemic range and habitat, but which has also been proposed for the species Euphyes berryi. Distinguishing characteristics between the subspecies: * The ground color of E. d. calhouni is darker, nearing black, compared to the dark brown ground color of E. d. dukesi, which contrasts with a black stigma in males. * Dorsal wings of E. d. calhouni have overscaling of olive-brown hairs, while E. d. dukesi have overscaling of orange-brown hairs. * On the ventral forewing of E. d. calhouni, overscaling is olive brown, while on E. d. dukesi overscaling is heavier and is orange brown, in strong contrast with the ground color. * On the ventral hindwing of E. d. calhouni, the yellow dash between veins M1 and M2 is diffuse and often does not reach the edge of the wing, and there is usually no yellow dash between veins Cu2 and 2A. On E. d. dukesi, both yellow dashes are typically heavily scaled and extend boldly to the edge of the wing in fresh specimens. * Wing fringes of E. d. calhouni are mostly dark and match the dorsal ground color, except a lightening in the anal region of the hindwing. In E. d. dukesi the fringes are lighter than the ground color. Conservation status Dukes' skipper's threat status has not been assessed by the IUCN Red List, nor is it covered by the US Endangered Species Act or Canadian Species at Risk Act. The state of Michigan lists it as a threatened species protected by state law, the Xerces Society Red List of Butterflies and Moths lists it as vulnerable, and NatureServe lists the species' national conservation status as N3 (vulnerable) in the United States and N2 (imperiled) in Canada, with a global status of G3 (vulnerable), last reviewed in 2008 as of 2013.

The introduction of Commercial paper as the short-term monetary instrument was the beginning of a reform in Indian Money market on the background of trend of Liberalization which began in the world economy during 1985 to 1990. A commercial paper in India is the monetary instrument issued in the form of promissory note. It acts as the debt instrument to be used by large corporate companies for borrowing short-term monetary funds in the money market. An introduction of Commercial Paper in Indian money market is an innovation in the Financial system of India. Prior to injection of Commercial Paper in Indian money market i.e. before 1990, the corporate companies had to depend upon the crude and traditional method of borrowing working capital from the commercial banks by pledging the inventory of raw materials as Collateral security. It involved more loss of time for the borrowing companies in availing the short-term funds for day-to-day production activities. The commercial paper has become effective instrument for these corporate companies to avail the short-term funds from the money market within shortest possible time limit by avoiding the hassles of direct negotiation with the commercial banks for availing the short-term loans. Commercial paper market The introduction of commercial paper as debt instrument has promoted commercial paper market as one of the components of Indian money market. In this commercial paper market, the issuers of commercial paper create supply while the subscribers to commercial paper create demand for these papers. The interaction between supply and demand for commercial papers promotes the commercial paper market. The main issuers of Commercial paper in this market are incorporated manufacturers and the main subscribers to the Commercial papers are the banking companies. Commercial Paper is issued by the issuers at a discount to face value of Commercial paper. The face value of Commercial Paper is in the denomination of Rs. 0.5 million and multiples thereof. The maturity period of Commercial paper in the Commercial Paper market ranges between minimum of 15 days and maximum of 1 year from the date of issue. The subscriber to the commercial paper is the investor, and a single investor in the Commercial paper market is not allowed to invest less than Rs. 0.5 million. The other issuers of Commercial paper in this market are Primary dealers and All India Financial Institutions. The other investors or subscribers to Commercial paper in this market are individuals, Non-Resident Indians and Foreign Institutional Investors. Commercial paper and credit rating agencies All eligible participants shall obtain the credit rating for issuance of Commercial Paper either from Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd. (CRISIL) or the Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd. (ICRA) or the Credit Analysis and Research Ltd. (CARE) or the India Ratings & Research Pvt. Ltd. (Ind-Ra) or such other credit rating agency (CRA) as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time, for the purpose. The minimum credit rating shall be A-3 [As per rating symbol and definition prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)]. The issuers shall ensure at the time of issuance of CP that the rating so obtained is current and has not fallen due for review. Issuers of commercial paper The issuers of Commercial papers in Indian money market are broadly classified into: * Leasing and Finance Companies * Manufacturing companies * Financial Institutions During the decade of 2000–01 to 2010–11, Leasing and finance companies had the average share of 70% of total issue of Commercial papers; while Manufacturing companies and Financial institutions had the average share of 15% each. Growth of commercial paper market in india Commercial Paper market had relatively higher growth from 1997 to 1998 onward. On 15 October 1997, total outstanding amount on Commercial paper transaction in Indian money market was Rs. 33.77 billion. This outstanding amount increased substantially to Rs. 1,28,347 crore on 15 July 2011. This growth of Commercial paper market may be attributed to the rapid expansion of corporate manufacturing and financial companies in liberalised and Globalized Indian economy during the last decade of 20th century and the first decade of 21st century. The growth of Commercial Paper market in India was more conspicuous after the financial year 2007–08. On 15 July 2007, total outstanding amount on Commercial paper transaction was Rs. 28,129 crore. This amount increased to Rs. 48,342 crore on 15 July 2008. Since then, there was substantial increase in the outstanding amount on Commercial paper transactions to the highest level of Rs. 1,283.47 billion until 15 July 2011. This period was largely dominated by the Late-2000s financial crisis. In this period, RBI reduced Repo rate drastically from 9% to 4%. However, Prime rate of commercial banks in India remained rigid at 12%. The discounting rate on Commercial papers was in the range of 6.5% to 10% in October 2010. It is explicit from these statistics that the cost of borrowing working capital through Commercial paper transaction became relatively lower for the corporate companies in India in comparison to the cost of borrowing the same working capital through cash credit facility from the commercial banks. The obvious result was an absolute growth of the Commercial paper market in India, particularly, after 2007–08 onward.

He had close associations with the Bornholm school of painters and made many paintings of Christiansø.Lars Rostrup Bøyesen \\"Karl Isakson\\", Kunstineks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 6 September 2011. He is cited as an artist who \\"sought to give their Biblical works a modern social and political context.\\" Biography Isakson was brought up in difficult circumstances in Stockholm. His father, blacksmith Karl Frederik, died when he was only eight months old, leaving his mother, Mathilda, to raise him and his sister Esther by running a laundry. At school he did so well he was known as the little professor. At home, in order to escape from the family misery, he began to draw, often surrounded by piles of laundry. He left school at the age of 13 to help out with the family finances by becoming a painter's assistant. When he was 15, on his own initiative he began taking evening classes in drawing at the Technical School. He also showed great interest in literature reading Swedish authors such as Viktor Rydberg and Wilhelm Ekelund and Danish works by Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen.Lena Månsson, \\"Karl Isakson - En konstnär för andra konstnärer\\", Tidningen Kulturen, 23 April 2011. Retrieved 7 September 2011. Before attending the Swedish Academy, Isakson worked as Carl Larsson's assistant, helping him with the frescos in the stairwell of the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm. Larsson took a great interest in Isakson and encouraged him in his studies. In 1902, he travelled on a grant to Italy where he came into contact with Kristian Zahrtmann and his colony of Danish painters who introduced him to modern French trends, especially Paul Cézanne. He returned to Copenhagen with Zahrtmann where he attend his art classes, meeting many young artists associated with the beginning of Modernism in Danish painting. He developed an interest in what he called pure art, which like pure thought conveyed life's universal correspondences rather than the partial details of Realism and Naturalism. Like Carl Kylberg and Violet Tengberg, he believed art should have an existential or spiritual function, conveying a sense of higher transcendental values. Thanks to his paintings of Christiansø, Isakson is considered to be one of the fathers of modern painting in Denmark. His landscape painting of Christiansø's Mindet (1911) shows how much he was influenced by Cézanne, both in his strong colouring and his use of parallel brush strokes.\\"Karl Isakson\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 6 September 2011. Artwork Studying in Paris (1905–1907), Isakson was influenced by the great French colourists, such as Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet and symbolists, above all Gustave Moreau. But it was in 1911 that he underwent a transformation, influenced by Cézanne's colour and mathematical approach. He continued to paint landscapes, still lifes and interiors but with a greater attention to colour and form in an analytical Cubist style. Like the Neoimpressionists, he juxtaposed fields of colour to achieve maximum effect. He often worked with complementary colours such as a blue bowl with randomly placed oranges. Cézanne's ability to dispense with the unessential in order to achieve true synthesis provided a starting point for Isakson to become a Modernist. After discovering Christiansø in 1911, Isakson spent much of his time painting the island's defences and landscapes. These became his favourite subjects, even though he continued to paint still lifes and models in a Copenhagen studio. After a spell in Paris (1914), where he studied under Henri Le Fauconnier and André Dunoyer de Segonzac, his work progressed from theoretical Cubism to a more Nordic style where his temperament and physical imbalance left their traces. When the military base of Christiansø was closed to foreigners during the First World War, Isakson suffered a nervous breakdown from which he never fully recovered. During the war years, he painted landscapes on Bornholm, for example Udsigt over Gudhjem (1921) while secretly working on a series of religious paintings focussing on death and resurrection. During his lifetime, Isakson rarely exhibited his work. His paintings first attracted attention after a commemorative exhibition at Liljevalchs in Stockholm in 1922. Works in Danish museums Kunstindeks Danmark provides an illustrated list of over 50 of Isakson's works in Danish museums. The largest collections are in Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen and in Bornholms Kunstmuseum.\\"Karl Isakson\\", Kunstindeks Danmark. Retrieved 7 September 2011.

History Designed by Quirinus Harder, it was built between 1866 and 1867. The octagonal, black and white tower marks the entrance to the Westerschelde. The tower is tall and consists of five stories. It is part of a series of lights marking the end of the Schelde river and guide traffic between the North Sea and the harbor of Antwerp. Nieuwe Sluis is the oldest extant cast iron lighthouse in the Netherlands after the one in Renesse was demolished in 1915. Initially it was yellow, then it received red-white bands, before it was painted black and white. The lens assembly was made by the French company of Barbier, Bénard & Turenne, and includes a copper cupola. Initially it was the first in a series of leading lights. During World War II the lighthouse was deactivated and covered in camouflage paint; it was not reactivated until 1951. Originally the lighthouse stood on top of the dike, but when that dike was raised as part of the Delta Works the lighthouse ended up on the seaside. Since 2010 it no longer serves a nautical purpose and in October 2011 the light went out permanently. Alternative uses for the building were investigated. In 2012 ownership was transferred from the Belgian government to a foundation, and in 2014 that foundation was granted E20,000 by Dow Benelux for repairs and renovations.

The song is also included in the 2010 compilation album, Gimme Some Truth. A tongue-in-cheek rocker, Lennon managed to get the phrase \\"tight ass\\" past the censors. Lyrics & music The title of \\"Tight A$\\" is a pun on the expressions \\"tight as\\" and \\"tight ass.\\" \\"Tight A$\\" is in a rockabilly style with a 1950s sound, along the lines of earlier rockabilly songs that inspired Lennon in his youth. Lennon biographer Geoffrey Giuliano describes the music as \\"funky.\\" It is reminiscent of Elvis Presley's 1954 single \\"That's All Right.\\" Pop music historian Robert Rodriguez also finds influences from Carl Perkins and Doug Sahm. Lennon developed the riff for his later instrumental \\"Beef Jerky\\" by toying with variations on the music of this song and \\"Meat City.\\" Du Noyer particularly praises the pedal steel guitar playing of Pete Kleinow, as does music critic Johnny Rogan. Pop culture historian Robert Rodriguez praises the \\"standout\\" extended guitar solo performed by David Spinozza. Lennon recorded the song at Record Plant East over many takes. Take four was the version that was edited for release on Mind Games. The backing track for the released version was composed of four separate segments spliced together. The production uses echo to compress Lennon's vocal performance. In 1975, Lennon wrote a letter to country singer Waylon Jennings, suggesting that Jennings record the song. Lennon believed the song would be a hit single for Jennings. Lennon had met Jennings, who had played in Buddy Holly's backup band, the Crickets, at the Grammy Awards several months earlier.http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/tag/george-harrison Reception Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes \\"Tight A$\\" as a \\"forced, ham-fisted rocker.\\" Author Tim Riley describes it as \\"dross.\\" Du Noyer criticised it for having little to say, lacking energy and being an example of Lennon's ability for \\"knocking off songs to fulfil the album's quota.\\" John Blaney also criticizes the song for having little to say, but acknowledges that the song's \\"jokey wordplay was a timely reminder of what Lennon was capable of.\\" Chip Madinger and Mark Easter regard the fact that the song isn't \\"about something\\" to be refreshing, given Lennon's \\"political ranting and raving\\" in the period just before the song's release and praise the song as \\"a rockin' little tune.\\" PopMatters describes the song as a \\"throwaway\\" but appreciates that it provides some \\"mindless fun.\\" Lennon himself described the song as \\"a bit of a throwaway.\\" Robert Rodriguez, however, regards it as one of the \\"best unsung John\\" Lennon songs and \\"one of the highlights of Mind Games.\\" Rodriguez considers it a rocker of the sort that the Beatles used to play in their early days, sounding like an American song sung by an Englishman. Although Rodriguez agrees that the song isn't about much, it represents the type of writing Lennon had often done earlier in his career \\"when a string of words that scanned nicely was enough,\\" and also praises the band's tight playing on the song. Johnny Rogan also praises the song as \\"one of the more interesting moments\\" of Mind Games, although acknowledging that it does not have the \\"greatest tune.\\" Keith Spore of The Milwaukee Sentinel called the song a \\"smashing serpentine rocker\\" which serves as a reminder of Lennon's past brilliance. Rolling Stone Magazine critic Stephen Holden regards \\"Tight A$\\" as one of the two highlights of Mind Games, along with the title track. Journalists Roy Carr and Tony Tyler also regard it as one of the best songs on Mind Games, saying it demonstrates the return of Lennon's \\"cockiness and irreverence,\\" which they consider to possibly be his best qualities.

His parents were among the founders of the settlement Kfar Azar. As a youth, Ofer joined the Haganah. He initially delivered Haganah newspapers to its subscribers, hung pro-Haganah posters in the middle of the night and oiled the guns belonging to the settlement. At sixteen, he left school and joined the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah. He fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and participated in Operation Danny in which the Arab occupied towns of Lod and Ramle fell to Jewish forces. His military talents did not go unnoticed and he was handpicked for officer’s training. In the midst of his training, he learned that his Palmach unit was gearing up for Operation Yoav, an offensive in the Negev region. He left officer’s school to join his unit in time for the offensive. By the end of the war, he attained the rank of sergeant while his classmates had not yet enlisted in the army. Ofer was married and had four children. Border wars, the Suez war and the Six-Day War Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he returned to civilian life but reenlisted in 1952. He was first assigned to a unit that tracked down Arab guerilla infiltrators. Later, he joined the paratroops and partook in many reprisal operations of the 1950s. During Operation Kadesh, Ofer commanded a paratroop platoon that took part in the Battle for the Mitla Pass. Later, forces under his command took part in the taking of the Sharm el-Sheikh military base, thus clearing the way for Israeli shipping to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, which had hitherto been blocked by Egyptian cannon. In the early 1960s, he was given a command position within Sayeret Golani. His unit became known as \\"The Flying Tiger\\". In 1962, Syrian artillery on the Golan Heights bombarded Israeli civilian targets, including fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. The Israel Defense Forces felt that retaliation was warranted and chose a Syrian military target near the village of Nuqeib. Ofer’s unit played a central role in operation Snunit (Swallow) which resulted in the destruction of the chosen targets. During the operation, Ofer charged the Syrian pillboxes while firing his machinegun and throwing grenades. He yelled at them, “surrender; you don’t stand a chance,” before silencing them with antitank fire. During the Six-Day War, his was one of the few battalions that did not see combat as his assigned objectives, Bethlehem and Hebron, fell without a shot. Following the Six-Day War, Ofer was appointed military governor of Hebron and Shechem and was lauded for his performance in those roles. Last battle and death Ofer wanted to rejoin a combat unit and after a request, was assigned command of the Haruv Reconnaissance Unit. The unit's primary responsibility was to conduct special reconnaissance and scout along Israel's border with Jordan in order to combat Arab guerrilla infiltration in the Jordan Valley. In 1968, Ofer was killed in action in Wadi Qelt, west of Jericho, while in pursuit of militants who had crossed the Jordan River.Teveth, Shabtai (1969/1970) The Cursed Blessing.

The Arab guerrillas were on their way to attack civilian targets and the force led by Ofer intercepted them before they could reach their target. Ofer was the sole Israeli fatality in the engagement, which also resulted in the killing of two guerrillas and the capture of six others along with a large weapons cache.Israeli officer dies in fight with Arabs, The Progress-Index, December 22, 1968 At his graveside, the Commanding Officer of the Central Command, General Rehavam Ze'evi said of Zvi Ofer, \\"the figure Zvika, the country boy, the youth in the Palmach, the scout, the commander, and the instructor, will remain engraved in our hearts\\".Bar Zohar, 197 The IDF Camp Ofer and Ofer Prison, founded in December 1968, are named after him.

It honors John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, a Lutheran minister, Continental Army general, Federalist Era American politician, and member of the prominent Muhlenberg family. The memorial is located in a one-acre park bounded by Connecticut Avenue, Ellicott Street, and 36th Street NW on the eastern edge of Washington's Wakefield neighborhood. Designed by architect John Harbeson, it features at its center a bronze bust of Muhlenberg, sculpted by his descendant, Caroline M. Hufford. Completed in 1980, 52 years after its construction was authorized by Congress, attendees at the dedication ceremony included West German ambassador Peter Hermes. The bronze sculpture of Muhlenberg is displayed on a limestone pedestal and surrounded on three sides by a concrete exedra. The memorial is owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. History =Background= In the late 19th century, the site of Muhlenberg Park was the intersection of Grant Road and Chappell Road in rural Washington County, D.C. In 1871, Washington County, Washington City, and Georgetown were unified under one district government, establishing the modern boundaries of Washington, D.C. Over the following decades, motorized streetcars made settlement in the far Northwest of the city more feasible. In 1907, the completion of a bridge over the Rock Creek gorge allowed Connecticut Avenue to run uninterrupted from downtown to Chevy Chase, Maryland. As the area was developed, Grant Road was gradually built over and replaced with a street grid, leaving only a few disconnected segments, including the Grant Road Historic District, remaining. Chappell Road was connected to 36th Street NW and renamed, leaving a small, triangular piece of land between it and Connecticut Avenue. 1917 United States Geological Survey topographic map, with modern streets overlaid. The location of Muhlenberg Park is highlighted in blue. In 1925, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Epiphany, located on 16th and U Streets NW, purchased 4900 Connecticut Avenue NW, at the intersection of Connecticut and Ellicott, from the Chevy Chase Land Company, intending to relocate there. The following year, Epiphany agreed to merge with St. Paul's English Lutheran Church, keeping the St. Paul's name and charter and using the Connecticut Avenue site for a new building. St. Paul's, founded in 1843 and based at the southwest corner of 11th and H Streets NW since 1845, had grown such that their historic edifice could no longer accommodate the size of the congregation. The Church set aside the front portion of the new property, cut off from the rest by 36th Street, for donation to the federal government, as a site for a memorial to Lutheran minister, Revolutionary War hero, and early-American politician Peter Muhlenberg. =Planning= On May 2, 1928, Congress passed Public Resolution No. 30, authorizing construction of the monument, with funds to be raised by the Peter Muhlenberg Memorial Association and the design to be approved by the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Library and the Commission of Fine Arts.\\"Joint Resolution Authorizing the Erection in the District of Columbia of a Monument in Memory of Peter Muhlenberg\\" (; , enacted May 2, 1928). Congressmen Alfred L. Bulwinkle of North Carolina, who sponsored the resolution, and R. Walton Moore of Virginia both spoke in favor of its passage in the House of Representatives.1928 Congressional Record, Vol. 69, Page H6553 (April 16, 1928). Calling Muhlenberg \\"one of America's great men,\\" Bulwinkle opined that \\"the appreciation of Congress should be given to the Peter Muhlenberg Memorial Association for the idea of erecting here, in the Capital of the Nation, a fitting monument to serve as a memorial to one of the men who helped to found this Republic.\\" Before further action could be taken, financial problems caused by the Great Depression resulted in delayed construction of the new church building and a halt in fundraising for the memorial. St. Paul's Lutheran Church from 36th Street NW in 2015. In 1959, the year after the church was completed, a committee was named to begin soliciting funds for the memorial's construction. Washington attorney and St. Paul's congregant Henry F. Lerch III was instrumental in relaunching the project, serving as chairman of the Memorial Association, with the goal of completing it in time for the United States Bicentennial. John Harbeson of the Philadelphia firm Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson, a former president of the National Academy of Design, was chosen as the architect while Charles Town, West Virginia-based artist Caroline Muhlenberg Hufford was chosen to sculpt the bust at its center. Hufford, formerly of Reading, Pennsylvania and Arlington, Virginia, was a daughter of noted architect and former Pennsylvania Congressman, Frederick A. Muhlenberg, and a third great-granddaughter of Peter Muhlenberg. The E. A. Baker Company of Washington was hired as general contractor. Following several changes to the site's preliminary design, including reducing the height of the proposed backing wall, the Commission of Fine Arts gave its approval in September 1975.1976 Congressional Record, Vol. 122, Page E3685 (February 18, 1976). The memorial cost $59,430 to build (). =Dedication= The memorial was formally dedicated on Reformation Sunday, October 26, 1980. Approximately 300 people attended the ceremony, including West German Ambassador to the United States Peter Hermes and Mayor James Lambert of Woodstock, Virginia, the town where Muhlenberg preached prior to the American Revolution; a color guard from Woodstock and about thirty Muhlenberg descendants were also in attendance. Dr. Russell Zimmerman, former pastor of the historic Augustus Lutheran Church in Trappe, Pennsylvania, gave a sermon at a preceding church service, calling Muhlenberg, \\"a giant among giants of the American fight for justice, liberty and independence.\\" Afterward, Henry Lerch was given the honor of unveiling the statue, and Robert Stanton, Deputy Director of the National Park Service for the National Capital Parks, delivered a speech accepting it on behalf of the federal government. =Later history= The memorial and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department, as part of the Rock Creek Park administrative area. The park runs along the Fort Circle Parks greenway, a proposal inspired by an unrealized portion of the McMillan Plan. Under its 1968, 2004 and 2010 master plans, the Park Service and National Capital Planning Commission suggested the creation of a system of trails connecting the Fort Circle Parks, including nearby Fort Reno, to each other and other open spaces in the District. Design and location Detail of the bust by Hufford The memorial sits in the center of Muhlenberg Park in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., alongside a segment of Wakefield's eastern border with Forest Hills. The one-acre pocket park is located on the plot of land bounded by Connecticut Avenue, Ellicott Street, and 36th Street NW. It is directly adjacent to St. Paul's Lutheran Church and Engine Company 31, which are to the west and northwest, respectively. Also close by are Politics and Prose and Comet Ping Pong, one block up Connecticut Avenue. The bronze bust of Muhlenberg sits atop a limestone base. The approximately high by wide sculpture depicts Muhlenberg in civilian dress, with his hands resting on an open Bible before him. The base, which stands approximately tall, resembles a pulpit and features, on three sides, carvings representing Muhlenberg's contributions to his country as a Clergyman, Soldier, and Statesman. The Clergyman side features an image of a Latin cross and the years, \\"1768–1776\\" inscribed below it. The Soldier side features an image of a saber and the years, \\"1774–1783.\\" The Statesman side features an image of a fasces and the years, \\"1787–1807.\\" The inscription at the front of the base reads: \\"JOHN PETER GABRIEL MUHLENBERG, 1746–1807; Serving HIS CHURCH, HIS COUNTRY, HIS STATE.\\" A rectangular concrete exedra with three plaques, each containing biographical information about Muhlenberg, flanks the rear and sides of the memorial. The memorial was originally intended to feature two fountains along with a pond or reflecting pool, both to be added during a second phase of construction. These plans were never realized.

In 1865, due to boom in construction and tourism, Southsea house was converted into the Queen's Hotel by William Kemp Junior. It was one of Portmouth's first hotels, and it focused on the leisure and relaxation for the upper class. At 4:20pm on Sunday 8th 1901 a fire gutted the entire hotel, leaving only the two outer walls that face Osborne Road and Clarence Parade. On Wednesday 11th it was deemed safe to enter the site and two missing chambermaids were discovered, dead, due to being trapped by falling rubble in the basement. In early 1902 plans were submit by the hotel owner at the time, G. H. King, to rebuild the hotel to cover the original footprint. The new hotel was to be much grander and more purpose-built, to include 63 rooms for visitors, and 33 for staff. The architect of the rebuild was London based T.W. Cutler. He was to design the hotel in the Edwardian baroque style in brown terracotta. This was a rising popular style across the British Empire in 1901. Designs were grand and lavish and no expense was spared. The hotel had to be designed to make a statement.

He was the son of Horace Mayhew, of Broughton Hall, Flintshire and his first wife Mary Helena Mayhew (née Dixon). He was educated at King William's College on the Isle of Man. He was an agriculturist and industrialist, with large landholdings and interests in a number of companies. In 1902 he was commissioned as an officer in the Denbighshire Hussars, a part-time yeomanry cavalry regiment. By 1913 he had been promoted to the rank of major. When the First World War broke out in 1914 the regiment was mobilised, and saw service on the western Front. The Denbighshire Hussars were converted to infantry as the 24th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Mayhew was wounded in action but stayed in active service, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1918. After the war he acquired Clayton Priory near Burgess Hill in Sussex, and took an active interest of the farming of the estate. He subsequently moved to Newton Hall, Great Dunmow, Essex. A Unionist in politics, Mayhew was selected by the Conservative Party to contest the Essex constituency of Harwich at the 1929 general election, but failed to be elected. Two years later a National Government of which the Conservatives were part, was formed. A general election was called and Mayhew was selected to be the Conservative and Government candidate at East Ham North. The government won a large majority and Mayhew was elected to the Commons, unseating the Labour Party MP, Susan Lawrence. He was re-elected at the 1935 general election. During the Second World War Mayhew acted as an army welfare officer, and he was knighted in 1945. He attempted to defend his parliamentary seat at 1945 general election, but was heavily defeated as the Labour Party won a landslide victory. His opponent, Percy Daines, gained a majority of more than 10,000 votes. Mayhew married Guendolen Gurney, of Blaenau Hall, Merionethshire in 1907. They had two sons, and she died in 1946. In 1950 his oldest son, John de Parigault Gurney Mayhew, issued divorce proceedings against his wife. He alleged that she had committed adultery with his father on a number of occasions between 1947 and 1949, and Sir John was forced to give testimony. His evidence was accepted and costs were awarded against his son. Mayhew died suddenly in January 1954, aged 69.

Denmark supports the efforts to get North Korea back to the six-party talks. History and hostile relations Denmark was one of the first countries to recognize the DPRK during the Korean War. Diplomatic relations between Denmark and DPRK were established on 17 July 1973. In October 1976, Denmark closed the DPRK mission to Denmark, and declared the mission as persona non grata, after charges of black market import, sale of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Later Norway and Finland followed. North Korea closed their embassy in Denmark in 1998, because of their budget reducement. Denmark supported the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695 concerning the DPRK's weapons program. Danish MFA Head of Department of Asia Susan Ulbæk stated that Denmark cannot accept a nuclear armed DPRK. In September 2009, nine North Koreans arrived at the Danish embassy in Hanoi, Vietnam to seek asylum. After the ROKS Cheonan sinking in March 2010, by a torpedo, Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Lene Espersen condemned the sinking of the Cheonan, stating that it believed DPRK was responsible. The Minister called on the DPRK to comply with its international obligations.

The service is operated every hour by DB Regio NRW. It is the third most widely used Regional-Express line in the area administered by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr with approximately 24,000 passengers a day. History  Today's RE 4 is the successor to the former StädteExpress line SE from Aachen to Hagen and Iserlohn. Later, the end point was moved to Hamm and after the abolition of InterRegio services it was extended to Munster. Under the second stage of North Rhine-Westphalia’s integrated timetable (ITF 2), introduced in December 2002, it was replaced by the Maas-Wupper-Express (RE 13) and the Ems-Börde-Bahn (RB 89) services between Hagen and Munster and the Wupper-Express has since then run to Dortmund with a stop in Witten. Route The Wupper-Express runs successively over the Aachen–Mönchengladbach, the Mönchengladbach–Düsseldorf and the Düsseldorf–Elberfeld lines. The service then follows the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway as far as Witten station, from where it uses the tracks of the Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg railway and the Oberstraße Tunnel on its way to Dortmund station. At night, the RE 4 operates to Düsseldorf Airport Terminal station. The Wupper-Express runs parallel to Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines on large sections of track and it has some of the character of a fast S-Bahn service and is perceived by passengers accordingly. Rollingstock The Wupper-Express uses class 111 locomotives and non-air conditioned double-deck coaches. Additional peak hour services operate between Düsseldorf and Aachen with class 110 and 111 locomotives, operated exclusively with refurbished Silberling carriages.

Only the (\\"Princesses' wing\\") of the historical building still stands. Pforzheim was the residence of Margrave Charles II, until he decided in 1563 to move to Durlach. What, if anything, the citizens of Durlach offered him during the negotiations is unknown. Charles decided to extende the medieval Karlsburg Castle into a palace and make it his residence. His successors further extended the castle, until the city was occupied by French troops in 1689. The French burned down the city and the castle. In 1698, Margrave Frederick Magnus returned from exile in Basel and started rebuilding the castle. Frederick had grandiose plans, but no money and the margraviate had been devastated by the war. A dispute erupted with the citizens of Durlach, who refused to support the rebuilding effort. By 1703 two wings had been completed and the margrave had moved in, when the project was suspended indefinitely. Frederick's son and successor, Margrave Charles III William, decided in 1715 to end the discussion and relocate his residence to a new palace outside Durlach. He founded the city of Karlsruhe, centered on his new palace. Charles and his court moved into the new palace in 1718. His wife, however, chose to remain in Durlach until her death in 1743. The Karlsburg was later used as an administrative office and even as a barracks. The Pfinzgau Museum has been housed in the castle since 1924. In 1964, a wing was demolished to make room for the Castle School at Durlach. The castle was extensively renovated from 1973 to 1988. Today, it houses the registry office, the Pfinzgau Museum, the Carpathian-German Museum, classrooms for adult education and the Margrave School, the historic banquet hall and the Durlach city library.

The Brown Dense is a 300- to 500-foot thick interval within organic-rich, fine-grained carbonate rock that comprise the Lower Member of the Smackover Formation.Heydari, E.

Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs. v. 43, no. 5, p. 315.Anonymous (2011) Dense Brown. Southwestern Energy, Houston, Texas. Within this area, the Lower Smackover Member lies at depths of 8,000 to 10,000 feet beneath the land surface.Anderson, E. G. (1979) Basic Mesozoic Study in Louisiana, the North Coastal Region, and the Gulf Basin. Folio Series no. 3. Louisiana Geological Survey, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 58 sheets.Eversull, L.G. (1984) Regional Cross Sections, North Louisiana. Folio Series no. 7. Louisiana Geological Survey, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 10 sheets. Source of Name The term “Brown Dense” possibly came from a description of the Lower Member of the Smackover Formation by W. B. Weeks.Weeks, W.B. (1938) South Arkansas stratigraphy with emphasis in the older coastal plain beds. American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin. v. 22, no. 8, pp. 953-983. He described it as “gray to brown, dense, cryptocrystalline limestone.” This description incorrectly implied a nonporous, non-permeable unit that lacks any potential for oil and gas production, which has discouraged until recently the exploration for oil and gas in this unit.Heydari, E. (2010) Hydrocarbon potential of the lower Smackover Formation in the north-central Gulf of Mexico (Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies Transactions. v. 60, p. 797. Lithology The Lower Member of the Smackover Formation, of which the Brown Dense is a part, consists of organic-rich limestone, which in places contains as much as 50 feet of sandstone and 100 feet of dolomite with excellent porosity and permeability beneath parts of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. Typically, the Lower Member of the Smackover consists of limestone composed of a sequence, from bottom to top, of laminated mudstone, thin-bedded mudstone, burrowed mudstone, and wackestone. The Brown Dense consists of the thin-bedded and burrowed mudstone.Heydari, H., W.J. Wade, and L.C. Anderson (1997) Depositional Environments, Organic Carbon Accumulation, and Solar- Forcing Cyclicity in Smackover Formation Lime Mudstones, Northern Gulf Coast. American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin. v. 22, no. 8, pp. 953-983. These mudstones were a prolific source of oil and gas for a significant amount of the oil and gas found in reservoirs in this part of the Gulf of Mexico.Moore, C.H., and E. Heydari (1993) Burial diagenesis and hydrocarbon migration in platform limestones: a conceptual model based on the Upper Jurassic of the Gulf Coast of the U.S.A., in A.D. Horbury and A.G. Robinson, eds., pp. 213–229, Diagenesis and basin development. Studies in Geology no. 36. Tulsa Oklahoma. American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Depositional Environment The Brown Dense accumulated on the bottom of a prehistoric stratified Gulf of Mexico. The upper part of the water column was well-oxygenated and subject to frequent algal blooms. Underlying these oxygenated waters and separated by a pycnocline, were anoxic and hypersaline bottom waters, which preserved organic matter as it accumulated. The organic matter consisted of algal material that fell downward from the overlying oxygenated waters.Sofer, Z. (1988) Biomarkers and carbon isotopes of oils in the Jurassic Smackover trend of the Gulf Coast states, U.S.A. Organic Geochemistry. v. 12, pp. 421–432. Age As part of the Smackover Formation, the Brown Dense is Oxfordian in age, 161 to 156 million years ago.Mancini, E.A., and T.M. Puckett (2005) Jurassic and Cretaceous Transgressive-Regressive (T-R) Cycles, Northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. Stratigraphy, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 31-48. Economic importance Estimates for the total amount of reserves of oil and natural gas in the Brown Dense (limestone) are unavailable. However, various organizations, i.e. the Louisiana Natural Resources Department and Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, argue that it is a very promising new source of significant economic reserves of oil and natural gas. Petroleum companies, i.e. the Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy and Southwestern Energy have leased land in both Arkansas and Louisiana for drilling for oil and natural gas within the Brown Dense.Griggs, T.

Geography  The village is surrounded on three sides by the backwaters of Linganamakki dam, formed by the Sharavathi River. Sigandur is about 40 km from its taluk headquarters, Sagara town. Sigandur was cut off from Sagar once the reservoir on Sharavathi River was constructed. Two barges carry vehicles, tourists, pilgrims and locals. Sigandur is surrounded by water on three sides and connected by road on one side, which can be reached via Kollur and Nagodi. Barge is the major means of transport. Sigandur Chowdeshwari Temple Shree Choudeshwari Temple is named Sigandur. Shree Devi kshethra was built in the 18th century. Sigandur kshethra is near Thumari, 42 km from Sagar town. Mother Choudeshwari is called “Sigandureshwari”. Shri choudamma Devi has strength to proceed the fear of thieves. The devotees who carry on benedicts will live happily without any fear of thieves. If any theft takes place in the home of these devotees, Devi punishes them. No other kshethra protects peo and their belongings from thieves. This is managed by the board “Shri Deviya Rakshane Ide”. If a thief steals from the place where the board is kept the thief will face several problems. Varadali Bhagavan Shri Sridharaswamy once visited Sigandur. Their Shri Sridharaswamy prayed for the goddess to change Devi from ugraswaroopi to mrudhuswaroopi and sowyaswaroopi to protect the devotees. On the right side of the temple “Bhoothada Katte” is written. Lord Veerabhadra guards the Kshethra. On the left side Shri Shaneshwara and Shri Raktheshwari Temple are found. The temple is managed by the temple committee, and Holekoppa Ramappa was committee secretary as of 2013. Ashada pooja During Ashada month (June - July), special pooja and worship are held. Thousands of people travel to join this pooja, resulting in frequent stampedes and injuries to devotees due to lack of crowd management.
