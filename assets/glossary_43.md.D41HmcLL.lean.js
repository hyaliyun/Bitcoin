A separate account allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance. An account may be a generic conservative or aggressive investment allocation, or a specific mutual fund-type account. Some offshore companies allow the account owners to specify the type of separate account to open. Separate accounts in the U.S. markets are often characterized as either managed or non-managed. A managed separate account is synonymous to a mutual fund in the sense that the investments of the separate account are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non- managed separate account is one that invests more \\"passively\\" in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a \\"fund of funds\\" whereby the separate account (\\"fund\\") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many separate accounts with similar baskets of securities. Separate accounts are sometimes confused with separately managed accounts (SMAs), which are privately managed investment accounts opened through a brokerage or financial adviser that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. These differ from mutual funds because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most SMAs require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

It combines a powerful melancholic crescendo with a rich poetic account of the exploits of sailors on shore leave in Amsterdam. Musically, it takes its base melody line from the melody of the English folk song Greensleeves. Brel never recorded this for a studio album, and his only version was released on the live album Enregistrement Public √† l'Olympia 1964. Despite this, it has been one of his most enduringly popular works. It was one of the songs Mort Shuman translated into English for the musical Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris. Brel worked on the song at his house overlooking the Mediterranean at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, the house he shared with Sylvie Rivet, a publicist for Philips; a place she had introduced him to in 1960. \\"It was the ideal place for him to create, and to indulge his passion for boats and planes. One morning at six o'clock he read the words of Amsterdam to Fernand, a restaurateur who was about to set off fishing for scorpion fish and conger eels for the bouillabaisse. Overcome, Fernand broke out in sobs and cut open some sea urchins to help control his emotion.\\"Paris Match no 2992 September 2006 Originally the song was situated in Antwerp, but moved to Amsterdam as 'Dans le port D'Anvers' does not fit the meter. Noteworthy is that in modern Amsterdam there is still a port, but owing to widespread automation and decline in crew sizes, there are far fewer sailors on shore leave.

At 638 meters deep, it held the record for deepest known cave in South America from 2001 to 2006 when it was surpassed by Abismo Guy Collet. With the entrance being 4372 meters above sea level and the depth being over 500 meters, it is the highest major cave in the world.http://cuevasdelperu.org/publicaciones/peru/2004_Pumacocha2004.pdf and It is located at . Physical and geological setting Pumaqucha (\\"cougar lake\\") offloading equipment for Sima Pumaqucha. The mountain in the background is L√©on Pitakana. Rock formations 700 meters from road and cave entrance. At 4,300 m to 4,400 m above sea level, the Pumaqucha valley is a typical Andes 'puna' ‚Äì high, treeless, and surrounded by 5,000 m peaks.http://cuevasdelperu.org/publicaciones/peru/2004_Pumacocha2004.pdf The valley is traversed by a dirt road serving active and abandoned mines nearby, and is dotted with stone huts used by locals tending flocks of sheep, llamas and alpacas. At the head of the valley is Pumaqucha, a small lake which along with its catchment area sits atop Miocene age granodiorite. Where the lake's outfall stream meets near-vertically bedded Cretaceous age Jumasha limestones, it has carved a short, shallow canyon containing several abandoned and one active sinkpoint where the entire stream disappears underground. Underlying the limestone is the Lower Cretaceous Pariatambo Formation. A small concrete canal, intended to keep the lake outfall on the surface by diverting it around the canyon, is in poor shape and normally does not function at all. When local repairs occur, the active sinkpoint (SP1) becomes enterable, but considerable water then leaks into the abandoned sinks (SP2 and SP3). On a regional scale, the long, irregular band of limestone containing Sima Pumaqucha and several other caves runs roughly south-southeast to north-northwest. The Pumaqucha waters sink at an elevation of 4,375 m above sea level, and are thought to resurge in the Rio Alis valley some 14 km to the north at an elevation of about 3,300 m above sea level. Cave description Sign at Pumaqucha cave entrancePumaqucha cave entrance Following the steeply-dipping limestone beds, Sima Pumaqucha generally consists of several vertical shafts connected by short sections of horizontal to steeply-sloping passages.http://cuevasdelperu.org/lima-yauyos/sima-pumacocha/https://bec- cave.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=1147:belfry- bulletin- no-516-summer-2003&catid;=68&showall;=&limitstart;=6‚ü®=en&Itemid;=508http://larepublica.pe/archivo/338120-expedicion- internacional-descubrio-en-yauyos-la-caverna-mas-profunda-de- sudamericahttp://peru.commscentral.net/?page_id=6 Although closely grouped together, the three main entrances each lead to extensive independent passages before meeting underground. SP1 and SP2 are within 60 m of each other but their passages join at about the ‚Äì300 m level, while SP3, a further 30 m away, is thought to join the main cave at a depth of ‚Äì550 m based on observations of relative water volumes (SP3 is blocked at ‚Äì120 m). All three entrances lead to big shafts: SP1 has the deepest shaft in the Andes (282 m), SP2 leads to the 113-meter-deep Ammonite Shaft, and SP3 is a 120 m shaft. Several fossilized ammonites up to 20 cm in diameter were observed within Ammonite Shaft‚Äôs walls. Below the junction of SP1 and SP2 are several wet shafts between 15 m and 75 m in depth, leading to a gravelled sump at ‚Äì638 m. All explored passages have been surveyed, with a total length of 1,427 m. It was hoped that the strong inward draught indicated a junction with a large underground river, but after losing the draught near the sump some cavers concluded that it might be due to the cave‚Äôs own stream.

This version was published in 1582. John Rut (fl. 1512 - 1528) was an English mariner, born in Essex, who was chosen by Henry VIII to command an expedition to North America in search of the Northwest Passage; on 10 June 1527 he set sail from Plymouth with two ships, Samson and Mary Guilford. The voyage was set up by Cardinal Wolsey at the wishes of Robert Thorne, a Bristol merchant.Paul O'Neill (2003) The Oldest City, The Story of St. John's, Newfoundland (p. 116) Samson was commanded by Master Grube and Mary Guilford was commanded by Rut. During the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, the ships separated during a storm, and it is assumed that Samson was lost. In early July Mary Guilford met heavy ice and turned southward; they reached the Labrador coast near St. Lewis Inlet, which they explored. In late July Mary Guilford set sail for St. John's. They entered St. John's harbour on 3 August where they had reported encountering eleven Norman fishing vessels, one Breton fishing vessel and two from Portugal. It was at St. John's, Newfoundland on 3 August 1527 that the first known letter in English was sent from North America. While in St. John's, Rut had written a letter to King Henry on his findings and his planned voyage southward to seek his fellow explorer. The letter in part reads as follows: > Pleasing your Honourable Grace to heare of your servant John Rut with all > his company here in good health thanks be to God. The conclusion of the letter reads: > ...the third day of August we entered into a good harbour called St. John > and there we found Eleuen Saile of Normans and one Brittaine and two > Portugal barks all a fishing and so we are ready to depart towards Cap de > Bras that is 25 leagues as shortly as we have fished and so along the Coast > until we may meete with our fellowe and so with all diligence that lyes in > me toward parts to that Ilands that we are command at our departing and thus > Jesu save and keepe you Honourable Grace and all your Honourable Reuer.

Historical note Convex geometry is a relatively young mathematical discipline. Although the first known contributions to convex geometry date back to antiquity and can be traced in the works of Euclid and Archimedes, it became an independent branch of mathematics at the turn of the 20th century, mainly due to the works of Hermann Brunn and Hermann Minkowski in dimensions two and three. A big part of their results was soon generalized to spaces of higher dimensions, and in 1934 T. Bonnesen and W. Fenchel gave a comprehensive survey of convex geometry in Euclidean space Rn. Further development of convex geometry in the 20th century and its relations to numerous mathematical disciplines are summarized in the Handbook of convex geometry edited by P. M. Gruber and J. M.

At 4,930m above sea level, it is the highest surveyed cave in the world. The entrance to the cave is in the mountain named Wamp'una. Cave description The mountain named Wamp'una; entrance to Qaqa Mach'ay at left centre \\"It is thought that Qaqa Mach'ay is an abandoned glacial sink formed on a geologically-favourable bedding plane. Its enormous entrance, approximately fifty metres long, thirty metres wide and fifty metres deep, leads to a square-shaped descending passage twenty metres high and twenty metres wide. Although this large passage is almost completely blocked by boulders, two possible continuations were noted. Blue Lips Passage essentially follows the left (as you face into the cave) wall down past boulders and ice masses.

Manguin entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts to study under Gustave Moreau, as did Henri Matisse and Charles Camoin with whom he became close friends. Like them, Manguin made copies of Renaissance art in the Louvre. Manguin was greatly influenced by Impressionism, as is seen in his use of bright pastel hues. He married in 1899 and made numerous portraits of his wife, Jeanne, and their family. In 1902, Manguin had his first exhibition at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and Salon d'Automne. Many of his paintings were of Mediterranean landscapes; and would soon represent the height of his career as a Fauve artist. 1905 Ind√©pendants Henri Manguin, 1905, La Sieste (Le repos, Jeanne, Le rocking-chair), oil on canvas, 88.9 x 116.84 cm, Villa Flora, Winterthur, Switzerland From 24 March to 30 April, the burgeoning of Fauvism was visible at the Ind√©pendants, prior to the infamous Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905 which historically marks the birth of the term Fauvism, after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their show of work with the phrase \\"Donatello chez les fauves\\" (\\"Donatello among the wild beasts\\"),Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

It is designed for quantitative absorption measurement at single wavelengths. Because it measures the transmittance or absorption of visible light through a solution, it is sometimes referred to as a colorimeter. The name of the instrument is a trademark of the manufacturer. Developed by Bausch & Lomb and launched in 1953, the Spectronic 20 was the first low-cost spectrophotometer. It rapidly became an industry standard due to its low cost, durability and ease of use, and has been referred to as an \\"iconic lab spectrophotometer\\". Approximately 600,000 units were sold over its nearly 60 year production run. It has been the most widely used spectrophotometer worldwide. Production was discontinued in 2011 when it was replaced by the Spectronic 200,, but the Spectronic 20 is still in common use. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Spec 20\\". Design Schematic electrical diagram of the Bausch & Lomb Spectronic 20 Colorimeter The Bausch & Lomb Spectronic 20 colorimeter uses a diffraction grating monochromator combined with a system for the detection, amplification, and measurement of light wavelengths in the 340 nm to 950 nm range. Schematic optical diagram of the Bausch & Lomb Spectronic 20 Colorimeter As shown in the schematic optical diagram (see left), polychromatic light from a source in the system passes through lenses which are reflected and dispersed by the diffraction grating to restrict the range of light wavelengths. This restricted range of wavelengths is then passed through the sample to be measured. The intensity of the transmitted light is determined by a phototube detector. Mechanical movement of the diffraction grating by means of the cam attached to the wavelength control enables the user to select for various wavelengths. This is the \\"Œª knob\\", wherein Œª refers to wavelength of light used for the measurement. Quantitative measurements Beer-Lambert Relationship Plot Many substances absorb light in the ultraviolet - visible light range. Absorption at any particular wavelength in the ultraviolet visible range is proportional to the concentration of the substances in the solution or other medium, in accord with the Beer-Lambert relationship. In a practical sense, the Beer-Lambert relationship can be stated as: A = Œµ x l x c in which A is the absorbance measured by the instrument, Œµ is the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, l is the pathlength of the light beam through the sample, and c is the concentration of the substance in the solution or medium. The Spectronic 20 is thereby commonly used for quantitative determination of the concentration of a substance of interest. The Spectronic 20 measures the absorbance of light at a pre-determined concentration, and the concentration is calculated from the Beer-Lambert relationship. The absorbance of the light is the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of the Transmittance of the pure solvent to the transmittance of the sample, and so the two absorbance and transmittance can be interconverted. Either transmittance or absorbance can therefore be plotted versus concentration using measurements from the Spectronic 20. Plotting a curve using percent transmittance of light yields an exponential curve. However, absorbance is linearly related to concentration, and so absorbance is often preferred for plotting a standard curve. This type of standard curve relates the concentration of the solution (on the x-axis) to measures of its absorbance (y-axis). To obtain such a curve, a series of dilutions of known concentration of a solution are prepared and readings are obtained for each of the dilutions (see plot at left). In this plot, the slope of the line is the product Œµ x l. By measuring a series of standards and creating the standard curve, it is possible to quantify the amount or concentration of a substance within a sample by determining the absorbance on the Spec 20 and finding the corresponding concentration on the calibration curve. Alternatively, the logarithm of percent transmittance can be plotted versus concentration to create a standard curve using the same procedure. The absorbance measured by the Spectronic 20 is the sum of the absorbance of each of the constituents of the solution. Therefore, the Spectronic 20 can be used to analyze more complex solutions. For example, if a sample solution has two light-absorbing compounds in it, then the user performs measurements at two different wavelengths and constructs standard curves for each compound. Then the concentration of each compound can be calculated algebraically.Wikipedia contributors. \\"Beer‚ÄìLambert law.\\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 15 Mar. 2017. Web. 8 Apr. 2017. The Spectronic 20 can be used for turbidimetric measurements. In microbiological work, the turbidity of a liquid culture of bacterial cells relates to the cell count, and OD600 measurements can be conducted for this purpose using the Spectronic 20. Likewise the turbidity of water suspensions of clays and other particles of size suitable for light scattering can be quantitatively determined by means of a Spectronic 20. In the past, the Spectronic 20 was used for clinical diagnostic purposes. Use Before testing a sample, the Spectronic 20 is calibrated using a blank solution, which is the pure solvent that is used in the experimental sample. It is typically water or an organic solvent. In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed. The original design of the Spectronic 20 utilized an analog dial for readout of transmission from 100%T to 1%T (top scale), 0A - 2A (lower scale). Using the original instrument requires manual setting of the wavelength and making readings from a moving-needle analog display. Replacement The Spectronic 20D (launched in 1985) and later the 20D+ replaced the analog dial with a red digital LED readout, offering greater precision in the readout, if not greater accuracy in the actual reading. A side-by-side comparison of the features of the 20+ and 20D+ is available in the 2001 operating manual. The Spectronic 20 was replaced by the Spectronic 200 in the Thermo Scientific spectrophotometer product line in 2011. The Spectronic 200 utilizes an array detector and digital control of the measured wavelength, while retaining the characteristic Œª knob of the Spec 20 for setting the wavelength. In addition to replicating the user modes of the Spec 20D+ (which it can emulate on a color LCD screen) the Spec 200 accommodates both test-tubes and square cuvettes without needing to install an adapter. Software modes described in the Spectronic 200's specifications include scanning, four wavelength simultaneous measurement, and quantitative analysis with up to four standards, in contrast to the SPEC 20D+ which offered only single point calibration. Product line history Originally introduced by Bausch & Lomb in 1953, the product line was sold to Milton Roy in 1985. Milton Roy sold its instrument group to Life Sciences International, renamed Spectronic instruments, Inc. in 1995. Spectronics Instruments was purchased by Thermo Optek in 1997, renamed Spectronic-Unicam in 2001 and Thermo-Spectronic in 2002. In 2003 the product line was moved to Madison, WI and the brand renamed to Thermo Electron. With the merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific in 2006 the brand changed to Thermo Scientific, and remained such until the end of the production run. Spectronic 20 instruments found in labs today may bear any of the Bausch and Lomb, Milton Roy, Spectronic, Thermo Electron or Thermo Scientific brand names.  Popular culture  The Spectronic 20 is apparently one of the few lab instruments to remain intact after the destruction of the laboratory in the movie Back to the Future.

Patterson Carlile Pollock Patterson (August 24, 1816 ‚Äì August 15, 1881) was the fourth superintendent of the United States Coast Survey. He was born in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, the son of Commodore Daniel Todd Patterson. He was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy in 1830. He studied Civil Engineering at Georgetown College, graduating in 1838, and returned to the Navy, assigned to work with the Coast Survey. He left the Navy in 1853 and captained mail steamers in the Pacific Ocean. In 1861, as a civilian, he was appointed as Hydrographic Inspector of the Coast Survey. In 1874, he was made Superintendent of the Coast Survey (and then the successor United States Coast and Geodetic Survey), a position he held until his death. Biography=Family Patterson was born in Shieldsboro (now Bay St. Louis, Mississippi), the son of Captain Daniel Patterson. He was the brother of Admiral Thomas H. Patterson, of Elizabeth Catherine Patterson who married George Mifflin Bache (brother of Alexander Dallas Bache) and of George Ann Patterson who married Admiral David Dixon Porter. Patterson married Elizabeth Pearson (daughter of Congressman Joseph Pearson of North Carolina) in 1837. They had several children; at least three daughters reached adulthood. Navy service Patterson was appointed Midshipman on the US frigate Brandywine in 1830 and served in the Mediterranean Squadron for five years. He was warranted Midshipman in 1831 and Passed Midshipman in 1836. He graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky as a civil engineer in 1838, and was attached to the Coast Survey from 1838-1841\\\\. In 1839 he was an officer of the Coast Survey brig when it captured the Spanish slave ship La Amistad, which the slaves had taken over, off Montauk, New York. (This incident became the subject of the film Amistad). He was commissioned Lieutenant in 1841. Patterson, as first commander of the Coast Survey schooner Phoenix, led the first USCS hydrographic expedition to the Gulf of Mexico in 1845, and subsequently commanded the Coast Survey steamer Robert J. Walker. He left active naval service in 1849 and resigned from the Navy in 1853.United States Naval Institute. Proceedings 8 (1-2) pXXIII, 1882.J.E. Hilgard, letter , Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 19, Oct 21, 1881, p522USCS Ships Phoenix Steamer captain Leaving Naval service for the commercial world, he commanded steamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, such as the Oregon and the Golden Gate from 1849 to about 1853, primarily running between the West Coast of Panama and San Francisco. His ships sometimes carried as many as a thousand gold-seeking men per voyage north during the California Gold Rush. He appears frequently as ship-captain in the reports of the newspaper The Daily Alta California. When California was made a state by Act of Congress, it was Patterson who brought the news to San Francisco, arriving on October 18, 1850, resulting in city-wide celebrations lasting well into the night. Shortly after this, Patterson moved his wife and child from Washington, D.C., to Oakland. With James B. LaRue and John R. Fouratt he sought to found one of the first ferry services across San Francisco Bay, fighting all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to win the right to provide service against a competitor. It is unclear, however, if he and his partners actually started a separate ferry line, and if so, how long it operated before being sold to another operator or shut down. He also engaged in real estate investments in San Francisco and San Diego. Several more children were born during this time in the Bay Area. Civil War In 1861, on the outbreak of the Civil War, the family returned to Washington, D.C. and Patterson returned to federal service, this time as a civilian hydrographic inspector in the Coast Survey. The Hydrographic Inspector was in charge of the charting and marine survey work, and that office was traditionally held by a naval officer. Patterson's experience and good connections let him step into the role smoothly. During the Civil War, the role of the Coast survey included preparing charts and other material to help Naval ships execute the blockade of Southern ports (the strategy known as the \\"Anaconda Plan\\"). He remained in the Coast Survey after the war, eventually becoming superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1874. Friendship with President Grant Patterson first met Ulysses S. Grant in mid-1852, when Grant was taking a detachment of troops across Panama for eventual posting in Oregon, and Patterson commanded the steamer that took most of Grant's troops north to San Francisco. It was during that posting in Oregon that Grant eventually, in 1854, decided to resign from the Army. During the Civil War, Grant coordinated with Patterson's brother-in- law, David Dixon Porter, in the Vicksburg Campaign, and may have met Patterson's brother, Thomas H. Patterson, who was a naval officer fighting in the Civil War. As a result of these pre-war and wartime connections, the Pattersons were well-known to Grant and other leading Union officers. From 1861 through the 1880s, the Pattersons occupied the Brentwood Mansion, designed by Benjamin Latrobe and inherited by Patterson's wife, in Brentwood, Washington, D.C., (since demolished), and it became a social center during the administration of President Grant. Patterson was one of the early members of Washington's Metropolitan Club, which included numerous Union generals, admirals, and other officers. A large oil portrait of Patterson's brother-in- law, David Dixon Porter, hangs in the first-floor lobby (as of 2007). Many of Patterson's papers can be found in the Manuscript Division of the U.S. Library of Congress.  Death and honors Patterson died at home in mid-1881. His unexpected death was a heavy blow to the Survey and led to the appointment of J.E. Hilgard as his successor; Hilgaard's term ended in controversy a few years later. Patterson, along with his wife, mother-in-law, and infant children who died in California, are buried in the Worthington vault of Oak Hill Cemetery, Washington D.C. His sister Eliza Catherine was also interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, while there is a cenotaph in Congressional Cemetery for her husband George Mifflin Bache, who was lost at sea. Patterson's father, Commodore Daniel Patterson, and his mother and brother, Thomas H. Patterson, were buried at Congressional Cemetery. Another sister, George Ann, and her husband David Dixon Porter were interred at Arlington National Cemetery. The survey ship , in service from 1884-1919, was named in his honor. The Patterson Glacier, and the Patterson River that runs from it, located south of Juneau, Alaska, near the town of Petersburg, a spectacular valley glacier featured in helicopter tours, are named for him. Patterson Street in northeast Washington, D.C., near his Brentwood estate, may also have been named for him. A bill for Patterson's widow On June 6, 1884, three years after Patterson's death, Congress enacted a private bill, House bill No. 4689, entitled \\"An act for the relief of Eliza W. Patterson\\", Patterson's widow, excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land, in light of the fact that Patterson had served as Superintendent without taking a salary and had, through inattention, placed the family finances in jeopardy. President Chester A. Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill, but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature. In a message dated June 21, 1884, the President explained \\"I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer, in view of the services he had rendered his country, from the burdens of taxation, but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law.\\" A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court, Winslow v. Baltimore & O R Co, 188 U.S. 646 (1903), which includes excerpts of the will by which Mrs. Patterson came into the property on the death of her mother, Catherine Worthington Pearson, in 1868. The suit, which the Patterson family won, involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad. Descendants In 1881, shortly after Patterson's death, his daughter, Harriet Livingston Patterson (1859-1923), married Lt. Francis Winslow USN (1851-1908), who had previously served under Patterson in the Coast Survey. They had six children, including Mary Nelson Winslow. Lt. Winslow was the brother of Rear Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow, a first cousin once removed of Rear Admiral John Ancrum Winslow, and great-uncle of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert Lowell. Patterson's grandson and namesake Carlile Patterson Winslow (1884-1960) was an engineer and head of the USDA Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wisconsin 1917-1946.

McLaglen and starring James Stewart, Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in Panavision. Loosely based on the life of rancher Col. John William Burgess, the film follows Martha Evans' (O'Hara) quest to fulfill her deceased husband's dream of introducing Hereford cattle to the American West. The film was one of the early major productions to be scored by John Williams, who was billed as \\"Johnny Williams\\" in the opening credits.  Plot  English women Martha Evans (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Hilary (Juliet Mills) come to the United States, in 1884, via boat with Hereford stock, pursuing the dream of Martha's husband, who accidentally died on board, to bring Hereford cattle to the West. They're now left with Hilary's bull, a result of years of European breeding, named Vindicator. Vindicator exhibits all the gentility of breeding, including an odd willingness to follow Hilary merely at the whistle of \\"God Save the Queen\\". At auction, Vindicator results in a bidding war and is ultimately won by Charles Ellsworth (David Brian), who has come to purchase stock for his partner the wealthy Texas rancher Alexander Bowen (Brian Keith). Sam ‚ÄòBulldog‚Äô Burnett (James Stewart), a local wrangler renowned for being able to take down bulls, is hired to transport the bull to Bowen's ranch. Ellsworth has bought the bull primarily to woo Martha, and when she is confronted by him when trying to claim her payment for the bull she decides to ensure Vindicator's delivery by accompanying him en route. Martha Evans is told by daughter Hilary about a conversation she overheard between Burnett and two men working for competing rancher John Taylor (Alan Caillou). Burnett has made a deal with Taylor to steal the bull. Hilary doesn't yet know that Burnett has made the deal mostly to ensure another wrangler (Ben Johnson) double crossed by Taylor would receive some money to take care of himself after an injury. One of Taylor's men, Deke Simons (Jack Elam), gets into a fight with Burnett in the saloon over terms. Evans, witnessing the brawl, comes to trust Burnett. Despite Burnett's objections, he ultimately accepts responsibility for the Evans women through the train ride to Dodge City and the following wagon trail. One night while Evans and Burnett have finished brewing coffee over the campfire, a gunshot knocks the coffee pot out of Burnett's hand. Burnett knows this is a signal from Taylor's men. Just before dawn, Hilary catches Burnett saddling up and suspects he is about to hand over the bull. He denies her accusations, waking her mother to prove he was innocent. Once again, Evans gives Burnett the benefit of the doubt. Taylor's men find a barbed wire fence that has been cut through to make way for Evans' wagon. They conclude that Burnett must have double-crossed them. Simons, determined to catch up with Burnett, shoots his companion and rides on after the wagon. In a canyon, Burnett runs into Jamie Bowen (Don Galloway), Alexander's son, who has appropriated a herd of his father's longhorn cattle as payment for his work and is running away to start his own ranch. Simons catches up and shoots a cowhand, setting off a stampede. Jamie tries to escape, but falls in the path of the charging cattle and is trampled. Battered and unconscious, Jamie is carried by Burnett back to the wagon. Simons is there holding Evans and her daughter hostage, demanding the money that Burnett was paid by Taylor for the bull. Simons also demands Evans' money, but while distracted, Burnett is able to take his rifle. Simons mounts and gallops away. Burnett follows. After the horses collide, Simons falls onto a rock and is killed. Burnett returns with the money, but Martha berates him for his dishonesty and the trouble he has caused. After a few days of traveling with Bowen's son in tow, they reach their destination, his father's ranch. At the ranch they're introduced to Jamie's father, Bowen, a Scottish soldier turned cattle rancher at a fort also populated by local families of Mexican heritage. While Hilary nurses Jamie back to health, Martha begins teaching the local children in school. Though Bowen and Burnett insist the Evans women should leave for the East again before they're snowed in, they refuse until Jamie is well and they've taught the men to properly care for Vindicator. Bowen continues to insist that Hereford cattle can't make it through the tough conditions on the range and thus make them a bad match. Martha and Hilary insist, and slowly, Burnett is coming over to their side. Martha, upon witnessing the wildness of the longhorn cattle, realizes that until Vindicator proves himself, they'll never have the men on their side. Hilary races back to the fort, and releases Vindicator into the wild. With Vindicator now in the wild to fend for himself and Jamie on the mend, the Evans women announce it is time for them to go, but Jamie insists he's in love with Hilary, who returns the proclamation and Martha, upon seeing them, realizes she needs to stay as well. This suits both Bowen, who's realized he's in love with Martha, and Burnett, who's known he loved Martha since they met. It is a particularly brutal winter and Burnett insists on finding Vindicator and bringing him back to shelter. Through repeated outings, he can't find the bull and while he's away, Bowen cleans himself up, begins serving tea and showing Martha his gentlemanly side in an attempt to woo her. Burnett is reported missing and the men finally find him, almost frozen. Bowen insists that he can have any calves that may have resulted from Vindicator, but surely the bull is now dead. Burnett refuses to give up hope, even though Hilary and Martha have come to accept this as truth. When the spring finally arrives, Burnett begins searching for Vindicator again, hoping for calves and begins building a new kind of farm, where the animals are treated better and Herefords can not only subsist, but thrive. He finally discovers Vindicator, long dead under a snowdrift. He still insists that calves may be coming. Martha, out of reluctance for anything else, agrees to marry Bowen, but only after there is no chance of calves from Vindicator. In one of the last scenes, Burnett finally finds a cross-Hereford calf, and brings him back to the fort. Bowen and Burnett fight over Martha, and Burnett declares his love for Martha, and Bowen steps aside. At the end, we're shown an entire field of Herefords, with Martha and Burnett musing that they're glad they kept a \\"few LongHorn, to remember the way it used to be\\". Hilary and Jamie approach, now married, and Hilary whistles in the hopes that one of the cattle will respond, and claims, \\"sometimes, I see a glimmer of him in one of them\\".

The reverse of a telegram from Eritrea showing British postage stamps (overprinted for use in Eritrea) used to pay the fee. Three 1984 telegraph stamps from Honduras. Some of the last telegraph stamps issued anywhere. Telegraph stamps are stamps intended solely for the prepayment of telegraph fees.The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia by R.J.Sutton & K.W. Anthony, Stanley Paul, London, 1966, p.240. The customer completed a telegraph form before handing it with payment to the clerk who applied a telegraph stamp and cancelled it to show that payment had been made. If the stamp was an imprinted stamp, it formed part of the message form.Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; Philatelic Terms Illustrated, Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978)  Usage  In most countries, the cost of sending a telegram was paid using normal postage stamps. These can often be identified by their distinctive telegraphic cancels or punched holes. In some countries and at some times, special telegraph stamps were produced or postage or revenue stamps overprinted to pay the fee (e.g. Nicaragua, Ecuador). Private companies also issued telegraph stamps in countries where the telegraph network was in private ownership. The first telegraph stamps issued might be those of the English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company, released in 1853. The first government-issued telegraph stamps were issued in India in January 1860. Occasionally postage stamps ran out and telegraph stamps were used for letter postage as an emergency measure, for example in Spain in 1879.  Collecting  Telegraph stamps are regarded by many philatelists as collectable. They are listed in most country specific catalogues though not usually in general stamp catalogs. The French Yvert & Tellier and the latest Stanley Gibbons catalog of British Commonwealth stamps do list these stamps. Telegraph and Telephone Stamps of the World by S.E.R. Hiscocks (1982) and Telegraph Stamps of the World by John Barefoot (2013) are the only catalogues which list worldwide telegraph stamps. American telegraph stamps are also listed and described in detail in United States Telegraph Stamps and Franks by George Jay Kramer. The first American telegraph stamps were issued by the New York City and Suburban Printing Telegraph Co., probably in 1859. The Royal Philatelic Collection of Queen Elizabeth II has many telegraph stamps as George V was an enthusiastic collector. It includes examples of British and Commonwealth stamps as well as private companies such as Bonelli's Electric Telegraph Co. Ltd., the Electric Telegraph Company and the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company.  The Stock Exchange forgery  One sideline to the story of telegraph stamps is the Stock Exchange Forgery of 1872-73 which was discovered in 1898 by Charles Nissen when examining used stamps from telegraph forms.\\"The Telegraphic Use of Great Britain Postage Stamps\\" by Andrew Higson & Steve Hiscocks, Gibbons Stamp Monthly, London, June 2007. The stamps were found to be forged due to the absence of a watermark and because they had impossible corner lettering. It is believed that a clerk in the Stock Exchange Post Office, London had been using forged one shilling green stamps on the forms instead of genuine stamps and keeping the fees. The culprit was never identified, but examples of the forgery are now sold for many times the price of the genuine stamps.  Demise  The telegraph was superseded by the fax, email, and mobile telephone text messages. The last telegraph stamps are thought to have been issued in 1993 by Honduras, and they might still be in use.\\"Collecting Telegraph Material\\" by Steve Hiscocks & Andrew Higson, Gibbons Stamp Monthly, London, January 2007.

Additionally, the site was the showcase for a number of Galcik's other projects, which generally had interactive humor as the unifying theme; in this respect, it anticipated the development of later sites such as Fark and Something Awful. The name SpinnWebe comes from an infamously bad machine translation of the German word for \\"spider web.\\"  Origin  In March 1993, Galcik started an FTP site on a machine called \\"spider,\\" named after the song Spider by They Might Be Giants. This site began as a way to serve files for various personal projects, including audio samples from TMBG songs. As the site continued to grow and as Web technology began to emerge, he began to phase out the FTP site in June 1994 and created \\"The Spider WWW Site.\\" Galcik later shortened the name to \\"SpiderWeb\\", but after receiving a letter from a company called Spiderweb Communications warning they carried a trademark on the name \\"Spiderweb\\", he changed the name of the site to \\"SpinnWebe\\" in April 1995. Galcik also derived his Internet alias, \\"spinn\\", from this word.  Dysfunctional Family Circus  In 1995, Galcik started the SpinnWebe version of Dysfunctional Family Circus (DFC), an interactive parody of the comic strip The Family Circus where visitors were invited to submit alternative captions for the widely syndicated Bil Keane comic strip. Galcik and a group of editors hand-picked the best captions for publication on the site. This curated approach is unusual, especially for a website with as much traffic as the DFC: the pool of submissions often exceeded a thousand captions per comic, and were generally edited down to around sixty. Fans of the DFC claim that this editing process helped maintain a higher standard of humor that other Family Circus parodies could not reach. Bil Keane has stated that he was initially unbothered by the parody, but he began to become uncomfortable with it due to the prevalence of blue humor in the published captions, and because readers were complaining to him.Tobin, Suzanne, The Washington Post \\"Comics: Meet the Artist\\" In September 1999, King Features Syndicate, the distributor of Family Circus, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Galcik. While the case could certainly have been contested on the basis of fair use, Galcik elected to honor the request out of courtesy toward Keane.Glave, James, Wired \\"Family Circus Parody Folds Tent\\"  Other highlights  SpinnWebe was home to many different features, some of which had their own domain names. Projects included: * A-1 AAA AmeriCaptions and its earlier incarnation It's a Dysfunctional Life, a feature similar to the DFC where visitors write captions for candid photos * Trapezoidal Inclination, or Brainshots, a blog that has run, on and off, since December 2000 * amusing.org, which presents a different visitor-submitted sentence or phrase six times a week, often of a surreal or absurd nature, and also allows users to submit illustrations of past entries * abevigoda.com, a site that shows Abe Vigoda's current \\"status\\" (alive or dead) * Scribs, a webcomic that also has a \\"reader mail\\" section, in which readers submit questions for the two central characters to answer Other notable projects included the Nipple Server (in which users rated pictures of Galcik's left nipple based on a rubric of panache, color, perkiness, and overall impression), and 1-900-ZWEBL√ñ (an advice column in which web-submitted questions were answered by members of a fictitious secret cabal or shadow government).

According to the 2010 census, there are around 3500 Muslims in the Czech Republic (less than 0.1% of country's population), compared to 495 in 1991. In the Czech Republic, there are two mosques in Prague and one mosque in Brno. History The first documented visit of a person with knowledge of Islam was made (964-965) by √çbrah√≠m ibn Jaq√∫b, a Jewish merchant from then-Muslim Spain. His memoirs were later published to become one of the first accounts about Central Europe in the Islamic world. During both sieges of Vienna, reconnaissance groups of Ottoman armies reached Moravia. Strong trade links between Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire emerged during the 19th century. Individual Muslims from the late 19th century began to settle in Czech lands after Bosnia became part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Traditionally, the influence of Islam on the culture of Czech lands has been small. Modern era A law 1912 by the Austro-Hungarian monarchy recognised Islam as a \\"state religion\\" and officially allowed its presence in what is now the Czech Republic. The first community (Muslimsk√© n√°bo≈æensk√© obce pro ƒåeskoslovensko) was established in 1934 and disbanded in 1949. An attempt to set up a new community in 1968 failed. In 1991, the Center of Muslim communities () was established. In 1998 the first mosque was opened, in Brno and a year later another, in the capital, Prague . Attempts to open mosques in other cities have been stopped by local citizens. In 2004 Islam was officially registered in the Czech Republic: the community is thus eligible to obtain funds from the state. Most of the Muslims are from Bosnia-Herzegovina (early 1990s), Kosovo (late 1990s) and former countries of Soviet Union (mostly from Caucasus region, from the late 1990s until the present). A significant and influential part are the middle-class people of Egyptian, Syrian and other Middle Eastern ancestries (typically those who studied in Czechoslovakia and decided to stay). A few hundred Muslims are Czech converts.Pan√Ωrkov√°, Petra: Konvertit√© k isl√°mu v ƒåesk√© republice, University of Pardubice, 2009.

Kennedy (1962‚Äì1963); director, President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency (1965‚Äì1966); consultant, President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (1965‚Äì1966); and Chief of Protocol of the United States (1966‚Äì1968). Congressional career In 1968, Symington was elected as a Democrat to the 91st Congress to represent Missouri's 2nd Congressional District. He served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977. While in Congress, he served on the House Commerce Committee and the Committee on Science and Technology, chairing the subcommittees on Space Science and Applications; Science, Research & Technology; and International Cooperation. In the 1976 election, he chose not to seek his seat for a fifth term; rather, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by his father, who retired after serving four terms. He faced Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes and Congressman Jerry Litton in the Democratic primary. Litton won the primary but was killed when his plane crashed en route to the victory party. Hearnes was named the Democratic candidate and ultimately lost to Republican Party candidate John Danforth. At the end of his congressional term, Symington returned to the D.C.-based law firm Smathers, Symington & Herlong as a partner.

To route the President's forces, Habr√© had allied himself with the rival warlord Goukouni Oueddei, who entered N'Djamena on February 22 at the head of his People's Armed Forces (FAP). The situation alarmed the country's neighbours, worried of a possible spill-over; as a result, already on February 16 the Sudanese minister Izz Eldine Hamed had arrived in N'Djamena where he negotiated a ceasefire among the rival factions. The Sudanese proposed organizing a peace conference in neutral territory, and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo offered Kano, in Northern Nigeria, as seat for the conference. He also invited as observers Chad's neighbouring countries (Libya, Sudan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Niger). The conference started with some days of delay on March 11, with the arrival of Malloum, Habr√©, Goukouni and Aboubakar Abdel Rahmane. Among the four, Malloum represented the French- backed national government, Habr√© and Goukouni the county's biggest insurgent forces, while Aboubakar, leader of a minor insurgent group, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Chad (MPLT), could count on the support of Nigeria. These four signed the Kano Accord on National Reconciliation on March 16, and it became effective on March 23, when Malloum and Habr√© formally resigned. The six points of the accord were: *The demilitarization of N'Djamena *An amnesty for all political prisoners *Dissolution of the militias *Formation of a new national army *Pull-out of French troops *Nigerian forces would supervise the ceasefire It also projected the foundation of a Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), which would have governed Chad till new elections. Malloum and Habr√© were excluded from the GUNT, but all of the four factions present at the conference would have two ministries in the Provvisional State Council that would govern in Chad till the full establishment of the GUNT. Goukouni was to be President of this Council. The French troops, present in Chad from 1978, were to leave the country and be substituted with a multi-national African peacekeeping force under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), represented principally by Nigerian troops. The Kano Accord was a failure, for it offended Libyan interests by excluding pro-Libyan factions like Abba Siddick's \\"Original FROLINAT\\" and Ahmat Acyl's Volcan Army, that menaced to form a counter- government if excluded from the GUNT. This brought Nigerians to search a new accord that would include a major number of factions; and from this was to emerge the Lagos Accord, signed on August 21 in the Nigerian city of Lagos, which took the place of the Kano Accord.

It began operation on 1 January 1993,Summaries of EU legislation, Intrastat system - statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States when it replaced customs declarations as the source of trade statistics within the EU. The requirements of Intrastat are similar in all member states of the EU, although there are important exceptions.  Motivation  Trade statistics are an essential part of a country's balance of payments account and are regarded as an important economic indicator of the performance of any country.HM Revenue & Customs, UK Customs Policy Export data in particular can be used as an indicator of the state of a country's manufacturing industries as a whole. The statistics are used by government departments to help set overall trade policy and generate initiatives on new trade areas. The volume of goods moving is also assessed to allow the planning of future transport infrastructure needs. Intrastat is also being used as a tool against VAT fraud, permitting the comparison between Intrastat and VAT declarations, for example in the UK and in Italy (as suggested by rules governing Intrastat in that country). The commercial world uses the statistics to assess markets within the country (e.g. to gauge how imports are penetrating the market) and externally (e.g. to establish new markets for their goods). In addition, the statistics are passed on to European and International bodies such as Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European Communities), the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. Intrastat data forms an integral part of these statistics and therefore it is important that the data submitted be of a high quality. Practicalities Each member country establishes an annual threshold value below which a business is not required to file Intrastat forms. The reporting thresholds vary from country to country and, within one country, may be different for dispatches (exports) and arrivals (imports). For the eurozone countries excluding Italy, thresholds for 2013 average 316,000 and 422,000 euro for arrivals (imports) and dispatches (exports), respectively. As established by Regulation (EC) No 222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009, the current thresholds are designed to cover 97% of dispatches and 95% of arrivals. This regulation raised thresholds with the purpose of reducing the statistical and, hence, financial burden on small operators. According to an EU Memo of 2013, the increased thresholds reduced the number of reporting enterprises by one third and saved them 134 million euro. Italy is the only EU country to set no thresholds, so all operators (excluding only new, young entrepreneurs in a facilitated tax regime) must file Intrastat forms. For the Intrastat system, the customs authorities provide the national authorities with statistics on dispatches and arrivals of goods. Member states then transmit their data to Eurostat on a monthly basis, generally within 40 days. The national authorities collect the following data: * the identification number allocated to the party responsible for providing information; * the reference period; * the flow (arrival, dispatch); * the commodity; * the value of the goods; * the quantity of the goods; * the partner Member State; * the nature of the transaction. Since 2010, Intrastat reporting also applies to services in both Italy and France. The collection of data on the intracommunity trade in services is not a part of the European Intrastat system, but is instead required by the EU VAT Directive. So, in these two countries, Intrastat forms replace EC Sales lists. Specifically concerning the commodity codes according to the Combined Nomenclature (CN), it needs to be acknowledged that although the CN is revised annually and published as a Commission Regulation in the EU Official Journal in October of the preceding year, the Member States have the right to collect more detailed information such as a more detailed commodity code by adding another digit to the end of the EU level 8 digit CN code (Article 9(2) of regulation 638/2004).

The FrentaniGreek: , Strabo, Ptolemy; , Polybius, Dionys. were an Italic tribe occupying the tract on the east coast of the peninsula from the Apennines to the Adriatic, and from the frontiers of Apulia to those of the Marrucini. They were bounded on the west by the Samnites, with whom they were closely connected, and from whom they were originally descended. Hence Scylax assigns the whole of this line of coast, from the frontiers of Apulia to those of Picenum, to the Samnites.Scylax ¬ß 15. p. 5. Their exact limits are less clearly defined, and there is considerable discrepancy in the statements of ancient geographers: Larinum, with its territory (extending from the Tifernus (modern Biferno) to the Frento), being by some writers termed a city of the Frentani,Ptolemy iii. 1. ¬ß 65. while the more general opinion included it in Apulia, and thus made the river Tifernus (Biferno) the limit of the two countries.Pliny iii. 12. s. 17; Pomponius Mela ii. 4. ¬ß 6. The northern boundary of the Frentani is equally uncertain; both Strabov. p. 242. and Ptolemyl. c. ¬ß 19. concur in fixing it at the river Sagrus (modern Sangro), while Pliny extends their limits as far as the Aternus, and, according to Mela, they possessed the mouths both of that river and the Matrinus. The latter statement is certainly inaccurate; and Strabo distinctly tells us that the Marrucini held the right bank of the Aternus down to its mouth, while the Vestini possessed the left bank;v. p. 241. hence, the former people must have intervened between the Frentani and the mouth of the Aternus. Pliny's account is, however, nearer the truth than that of Strabo and Ptolemy; for it is certain that Ortona and Anxanum (modern Lanciano), both of which are situated considerably to the north of the Sagrus, were Frentanian cities. The latter is indeed assigned by Ptolemy to that people,iii. 1. ¬ß 65. while Strabo also terms Ortona the port or naval station of the Frentani,, v. p. 242. but erroneously places it to the south of the river Sagrus. Hence, their confines must have approached within a few miles of the Aternus, though without actually abutting upon that river. On the west, they were probably not separated from the Samnites by any well-marked natural boundary, but occupied the lower slopes of the Apennines as well as the hilly country extending from thence to the sea, while the more lofty and central ridges of the mountains were included in Samnium. Affiliations and history The Frentani are expressly termed by Strabo as a Samnite people, and he appears to distinguish them as such from the neighbouring tribes of the Marrucini, Peligni, and Vestini, with whom they had otherwise much in common.Strabo v. p. 241. They, however, appear in history as a separate people, having their own national organisation; and though they may at one time (as suggested by Niebuhr) have constituted one of the four nations of the Samnite confederacy, this seems to have been no longer the case when that power came into collision with Rome. Their conduct during the long struggle between the Samnites and Romans renders this almost certain. In 319 BC, indeed, when their name occurs for the first time in history,The old editions of Livy have \\"Ferentani\\"; but the conjecture of Sigonius that we should read Frentani, is supported by some of the best manuscripts, and may be regarded as certainly correct. (See Alschefski, ad. loc.; Niebuhr, vol iii. p. 225.) they appear in arms against Rome, but were quickly defeated and reduced to submission;Livy ix. 16. and a few years afterwards (304 BC), at the close of the Second Samnite War, the Frentani are mentioned, together with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Peligni, as coming forward voluntarily to sue for a treaty of alliance with Rome,Id. ix. 45. which they seem to have subsequently adhered to with steadfastness. Hence we find more than once express mention of the Frentanian auxiliaries in the war with Pyrrhus; and one of their officers, by the name of Oblacus, distinguished himself at the battle of Heracleia.Dionys. Fr. Didot. xx. 2; Plutarch Pyrrh. 16; Florus i. 18. ¬ß 7. They gave a still more striking proof of fidelity during the Second Punic War, by adhering to the Roman cause after the battle of Cannae, when so many of the Italian allies, including the greater part of the Samnites, went over to Hannibal.Livy xxii. 61; Silius Italicus viii. 521, xv. 567. Throughout this period they appear to have been much more closely connected in their political relations with their neighbours the Marrucini, Peligni, and Vestini, than with their Samnite kinsmen: hence, probably, it is that Polybius, in enumerating the forces of the Italian allies, classes the Frentani with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Vestini, while he reckons the Samnites separately. (Pol. ii. 24.) Notwithstanding their vaunted fidelity, the Frentani joined in the general outbreak of the Italian allies in the great Social War, 90 BC:Appian, B.C. i. 39; Strabo v. p. 241. they do not, however, appear to have taken any prominent part, and we can only infer that they received the Roman franchise at the same time as the neighbouring tribes. Hence they are mentioned by Cicero, a few years later, as sending some of their chief men \\"Frentani homines nobilissimi\\", pro Cluentio 69. to support the cause of Cluentius, a native of Larinum. Their territory was traversed without resistance by Julius Caesar at the outbreak of the Civil War, 49 BC,Caes. B.C. i. 23. and this is the last occasion on which their name appears in history. Their territory was formed into the fourth region of Augustus, together with that of the Marrucini, Peligni, Marsi, etc.;Pliny iii. 12. s. 17. but at a later period it appears to have been reunited with Samnium, and was placed under the authority of the governor of that province.Mommsen, ad Lib. Col. p. 206. Geography The territory of the Frentani is for the most part hilly, but fertile. It is traversed by numerous rivers, which have their sources in the more lofty mountains of Samnium, and flow through the land of the Frentani to the Adriatic: the principal of these, besides the Tifernus, which constituted the southern limit of their country, are the Trinius (modern Trigno), which, according to Pliny, had a good port at its mouth;(\\"Flumen Trinium portuosum\\", Pliny iii. 12. s. 17. and the Sagrus (Sangro), which enters the Adriatic about halfway between Histonium (modern Vasto) and Ortona. The Tabula Peutingeriana also gives the name of a river that it places between Ortona and Anxanum, and calls Clotoris. The name is probably corrupt; but the stream meant (if its position can be depended upon) could be the Moro, which falls into the Adriatic a few kilometers south of Ortona. The coast-line of this part of the Adriatic presents few remarkable features, and no good natural harbors. The mouths of the rivers, and the two projecting points of Termoli (ancient Buca) and the Punta della Penna, afford the only places of anchorage. Towns The towns of the Frentani mentioned by ancient writers are few in number; but the topography of the district has been thrown into great confusion by the perverted zeal of certain local antiquarians, and by the reliance placed on inscriptions published by some early writers, which there is great reason to regard as forgeries. The Antichit√† Frentane (2 vols. 8vo., Naples, 1809) of the Abbate Romanelli, who was a native of this part of Italy, is a very uncritical performance; but the author was led astray principally by the inscriptions and other documents put forth by Polidoro, an Italian antiquary of the 18th century, who appears to have had no hesitation in forging, or at least corrupting and altering them in such a manner as to suit his purpose.Mommsen, Inscr. Regn. Neap., Appendix, p. 30. Romanelli, in his later and more extensive work,Antica Topografia Istorica del Regno di Napoli, 3 vols. 4to., Naples, 1818. simply abridged the results of his former book; and Cramer, as usual, blindly follows Romanelli. Along the sea-coast (proceeding from north to south) were situated Ortona, Histonium, and Buca. The two former may be clearly fixed, Ortona retaining its ancient name, and the ruins of Histonium being still extant at Vasto, but there is considerable difficulty in determining the site of Buca, which may however be fixed with much probability at Termoli; the arguments that have led many writers to place it near Villa Santa Maria being based principally upon the spurious inscriptions just alluded to. The existence of a town called Interamna, supposed by Romanelli and Cramer to have occupied the site of Termoli, is derived only from the same apocryphal source; and, even were the inscription itself authentic, the Interamna there meant is probably the well-known town of the Praetutii.Murat. Inscr. p. 1050, no. 7; Mommsen, l. c. The only inland town of importance among the Frentani was Anxanum (Lanciano); but, besides this, Pliny mentions, in the interior of the country, the \\"Carentini supernates et infernates\\", and the Lanuenses; the former (apparently a corruption of Caretini or Carricini) and the latter are otherwise unknown, and the site of their towns cannot be fixed with any approach to certainty. On the other hand, the Tabula gives the name of a place called Pallanum of which no other mention occurs, but the site of which, according to Romanelli, is marked by extensive ruins at a place called Monte Pallano, about 5 km southwest of Atessa. The previous station given by the same authority is called Annum; a name probably corrupt, but the true reading for which is unknown.Tab. Peut.; Geographer of Ravenna iv. 31. Uscosium, a place given in the Itinerary of Antoninus, which reckons it 15 miles from Histonium, on the road into Apulia,Itin. Ant. p. 314. is fixed by this distance at a spot near the right bank of the little river Sinarca, about 9 km southwest of Termoli, but in the territory of Guglionesi, where considerable remains of an ancient town are said to existRomanelli, vol. iii. p. 24. Roads Mercury and Pegasus. There is considerable obscurity in regard to the Roman roads through the territory of the Frentani. The name of the Via Trajana Frentana rests only on the authority of a dubious inscription; nor is there any better evidence for the fact that the construction of the high road through this district was really owing to that emperor. But it is certain that an ancient road traversed the territory of the Frentani, in its whole length from Aternum to Larinum, keeping for the most part near the sea-coast, but diverging for the purpose of visiting Anxanum. The stations along it are thus given in the Itinerary of Antoninus: *Ostia Aterni to Angulum (Angulus), x. M.P. *Angulus to Ortona, xi. M.P. *Ortona to Anxano, xiii. M.P. *Anxano to Histonios, xxv. M.P. *Histonios to Uscosio, xv. M.P. *Uscosio to Arenio (Larinum ?), xiv. M.P. Of these, Angulus or Angulum is certainly misplaced, possibly present day Citt√† Sant'Angelo, and should have been inserted between Hadria (modern Atri) and the Aternus. The distance from the mouths of the Aternus at Pescara to Ortona is considerably understated, and that from Ortona to Anxanum as much overrated; but still the line of the road may be tolerably well made out, and an ancient Roman bridge, over the Sangro between Lanciano and Vasto, supplies a fixed point in confirmation. The road given in the Tabula, on the contrary, strikes inland, from the mouth of the Aternus to Teate (modern Chieti), and thence to Ortona, and again between Anxanum and Histonium makes a bend inland by Annum and Pallanum. The distances given are very confused, and in many instances probably corrupt. They stand thus: *Ostia Aterni to Teano Marrucino, xvi. M.P. *Teano Marrucino to Ortona, xi. M.P. *Ortona to Anxana, iii. M.P. *Anxana to Annum, iiii. M.P. *Annum to Pallanum, xii. M.P. *Pallanum to Istonium, xxiii., M.P. *Istonium to Larinum, \\"corrupt\\" Coinage There exist copper coins with the Oscan legend \\"Frentrei\\", which may probably be referred to the Frentani rather than to the town of Ferentum in Apulia, to which they have been assigned by some writers. Others are of opinion that they indicate the existence of a city of the name of Frentrum as the capital of the Frentani, which is supposed to be the one referred to by LivyLivy, ix. 16. where he says \\"Frentanos vicit urbemque ipsam - in deditionem accepit\\", without naming the city.Julius Friedl√§nder, Oskische M√ºnzen, p. 42; James Millingen, Numismatique de l'Italie, p. 180. The town Larinum issued coins of the 3rd century BC that bear a Latin legend \\"LARINOR(VM)\\".

It was founded in 1893 as The Windsor Resort. It is located at the south end of the boardwalk, where it consists of a year-round indoor facility, The Haunted House (which resides on its own lot on the Boardwalk strip), and three outdoor lots. History Daniel B. Trimper and his wife, Margaret, arrived in Ocean City in 1890. By 1893 they were owners of boardwalk property between South Division and South First Streets, including two hotels: The Eastern Shore and the Sea Bright. Rebuilding the Sea Bright in 1900 following a severe storm, the Trimpers modeled the new structure on Great Britain's Windsor Castle. The two hotels together with a theater and an amusement park thus became known as Windsor Resort. A 1912 purchase also adds to the historic significance of Trimper's Rides. It was that year that Daniel Trimper purchased a massive carousel from the Herschell-Spillman Company in North Tonawanda, NY. It was 50 feet in diameter with a uniqueness derived from the only other carousel made by the firm at that time having been sent to Coney Island, and that one was later destroyed by fire. The carousel's forty-five animals, three chariots and one rocking chair were driven by a steam engine; rides originally cost just a nickel. One-hundred years later, the ride (now electrified) costs four tickets, or $2.00. Classified as one of the oldest still operating carousels in the nation, the carousel includes a standing and jumping menagerie of standing and jumping horses, a mule, a zebra, a cat, a dog, a pig, a frog, a rooster, a rabbit, a deer, a lion, a tiger, an ostrich, a camel, a giraffe, and a dragon. Over the years the Trimpers added numerous rides; several of these rides also offer historic significance such as a kiddie carousel which is smaller and dates to the 1920s as does a kiddie ferris wheel. All the rides are kept in working condition. In the 1950s the Trimper family added outdoor rides. The pace of expansion has increased since the mid-1960s with a new ride being added nearly year after year. The most popular ride in the outdoor park was bought in 1985: the double-loop boomerang \\"Tidal Wave\\" roller coaster. Other action favorites, among the 35 or more rides in the park, are the Rock & Roll Matterhorn and Himalaya, although parents with smaller children like the ones they can ride together, such as the colorful Balloon ride. The many games have their aficionados, as well, with stuffed animal prizes awarded to the winners at Frog Bog and Whac-A-Mole. Trimper's seven children and their descendants have also played roles in Ocean City's political life and other businesses. Trimper's son, Daniel, Jr., managed Windsor Resort Corporation after his father's death, and served as Mayor of Ocean City for 16 years. In 1965, WWII veteran, Daniel Trimper III, was handed leadership of the park and nearly doubled its size with the purchase of the land and attractions of Melvin Amusements. In 1964, Granville Trimper teamed up with Bill Tracy to create the Haunted House with scare technology and novel artistry that is Tracy's signature style. Five year's later, John and Maria Bilous wire hired to restore the cherished Herschell-Spillman Carousel to its formal glory. The last big change of the park for decades to come was the addition of the double loop Tidal Wave. Dan Trimper III ran a profitable amusement park until 1981 when he retired. After Dan Trimper III retired his cousin Granville Trimper and family took over the day to day operations until 2020. The Rides The Pirate's Cove Fun House is one of only two Bill Tracy built walk-through's left in the world. Aladin's Lamp is a small portable-style \\"fun house\\". It includes a number of floor tricks, a revolving turn-table and a spinning barrel. This ride was retired on January 10, 2018. The Indoor Area contains most of the rides for younger kids. It plays host to a collection of vintage amusement park memorabilia and paraphernalia, ranging from antique ticket booths, to operating antique rides. The main attractions inside this part of the building are: * A large collection of operating vintage William F. Mangels kiddie rides * A circa 1912 Herschell-Spillman Carousel with a menagerie of horses, a zebra, a dragon, a rooster, and other animals and three chariots * A Bumper Car ride * A Shooting Gallery The park's dark ride, \\"The Haunted House\\", was built by Bill Tracy in 1964 as a 1-level attraction on a lot facing the boardwalk strip. The ride was later expanded on when nearby Playland Park closed, leaving their own Tracy dark ride, \\"Ghost Ship\\", up for grabs. Trimper's incorporated the tricks from the ride by adding a second level to the ride, making it twice as long. The ride was originally believed to have opened in 1962, but after the recent discovery of correspondence linked to the ride, its actual opening year was discovered to be two years later. The ride was said to be Granville Trimper's favorite. The Toboggan Roller Coaster, retired in Winter 2009. The three outdoor areas, where most of the major rides are located, are open during the summer season. Among the rides are: * \\"The Tidal Wave\\", a tall looping roller coaster * \\"Pirates Cove\\", a Bill Tracy designed walk-through fun house; one of only two left in the world * A Mirror Maze * \\"Spinning Coaster\\", a family roller coaster * \\"The Rock N Roll\\", a Matterhorn ride * The Endeavor \\"thrill ride\\" Status The park began to experience troubled times during the 2007 season. The Carousel House/indoor area was made a historic landmark in 2007. Park owner Granville Trimper died in October 2008, leaving the park in his family's hands. The park opened for the 2009 season under a joint management of Granville's relatives. The park is now operated by the 5th generation of Trimpers.

He organized a chapter of S≈Çu≈ºba Zwyciƒôstwu Polski (later transformed into ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej and then into Armia Krajowa) in Pomorze. He was instrumental in coordinating the activities of various Polish resistance organizations in the Pomorze region, until the majority of them merged into Armia Krajowa. After the death of J√≥zef Ratajczak in May 1940, he was the unofficial commander of Polish resistance in Pomorze.

During that time, he lived mostly in Toru≈Ñ, although every few months he traveled to Warsaw for meetings with commanders of AK (Stefan Rowecki and Tadeusz Komorowski). He was involved in the spying on the Peenem√ºnde Nazi rocket facility, as one of the links between Polish operatives in the field, AK HQ, and through them, the Western Allies. Together with Marian G√≥rski (codename \\"Wencel\\"), the chief of Kedyw espionage unit, he organized Operation Gotingen- Vulkan, involving spreading Polish resistance actions (espionage, sabotage, propaganda) throughout Germany itself. His wife, a courier for the Polish resistance, died in the Warsaw Uprising, 1944. From 1945 to 1947 he was imprisoned by the communist regime of the People's Republic of Poland.

It was released in 1996 on Jade Tree. Background The Promise Ring were formed from the aftermath of several Midwest emo groups in February 1995: guitarists Jason Gnewikow and Matt Mangan (both formerly of None Left Standing), drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta (both formerly of Ceilishrine). Mangan moved to Indianapolis soon after the group formed, resulting in them inviting Cap'n Jazz guitarist Davey von Bohlen after he had moved to Milwaukee. He was friends with Gnewikow prior to this, but hadn't met Dider or Beschta before the group formed. The band recorded a three-track demo (\\"Jupiter\\", \\"12 Sweaters Red\\" and \\"Mineral Point\\") in early March, and played their first show shortly afterwards. In June, the group went on a 10-day east coast tour; after a brief five-day rest, Bohlen went back on tour with Cap'n Jazz to support the release of their debut. After the ninth day of the tour, Cap'n Jazz broke up, and Bohlen was able to focus his time on the Promise Ring. The band released a 7\\" vinyl single (\\"Watertown Plank\\" and \\"Mineral Point\\") through Foresight Records, which was owned by a friend of theirs. The band then went on tour, performing in church halls and basements across the US. Texas Is the Reason guitarist Norman Brannon had a copy of the group's demo and 7\\" single and gave them to Jade Tree co-founder Tim Own. Shortly afterwards, the band found themselves signed to the independent label. After further touring at the start of 1996, the Falsetto Keeps Time EP was released in February, and was followed by a split single with Texas Is the Reason in May. Both releases were successful, with the band continuing to tour and work on material that would feature on their debut album. Production According to Bohlen, the album was recorded in five days \\"in a situation where we had no idea what we wanted to do or how we wanted it to come out.\\" Additionally, Bohlen was ill during the making of it, resulting in issues with his vocals. Zac Crainz of the Dallas Observer claimed the studio \\"apparently only had enough microphones to record the guitars.\\" Didier later said in retrospect: \\"it was the wrong recording at the wrong time with the wrong person.\\" Casey Rice had recently returned from touring around Europe with Tortoise, and to him, he felt that he was simply recording a punk rock act. Didier added: \\"So we were all like, ‚ÄúThis is our first record,‚Äù so it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOkay, cool, okay. Whatever. I love Tortoise!‚Äù We did that, and then listening back on the way home we were like, ‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù\\" Musically, 30¬∞ Everywhere has been described as avant-pop and emo. Release and reception=Promotion and touring 30¬∞ Everywhere on September 10, 1996 through Jade Tree. Despite this, the release was an underground success, earning the group attention from independent publications. The attention was aided by the inclusion of the emo staple \\"A Picture Postcard\\", which had been released earlier on the Falsetto Keeps Time EP. The band had 500‚Äì600 copies of the album to sell over the course of several gigs, however, during one show at CBGB's, they sold all copies in one go. After breaking for the Christmas period, the band went on a six-week US tour with Texas Is the Reason. In April and May 1997, the group embarked on a European tour. 30¬∞ Everywhere was released in Japan in October 1999 through Cutting Edge. The album was re-pressed on vinyl alongside Nothing Feels Good (1997) and Very Emergency (1999) in late 2015. Critical response and legacy AllMusic reviewer Blake Butler said the band \\" certainly know how to write sharp, powerful, and beautiful songs.\\" Adding that the album was \\"very catchy, very intense, [and] very powerful.\\" 30¬∞ Everywhere has been cited as one of the popular emo releases from the era, serving as both a benchmark and a blueprint for it. LA Weekly included the album on their list of the top 20 best emo albums. Man Overboard included a cover of \\"Red Paint\\" on their compilation The Human Highlight Reel (2011).

The game takes place in an alternate reality during World War II, where players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of \\"the Empire\\"), fighting against enemies (\\"the Union\\") that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers. A port for the Dreamcast was released in 2006 and marketed as the last game for the system, although two more were released the following year. The game was commercially successful, but received average reviews from critics because of its traditional and derivative gameplay. A high-definition remaster, Under Defeat HD, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012, published by Rising Star Games. The updated version contains improved visuals, new control scheme options, and a new gameplay mode to adapt the game for 16:9 displays. This version was re-released in arcades as Under Defeat HD+. Gameplay The player firing at enemy battleships In Under Defeat, the player assumes control of a helicopter. The gameplay bears resemblance to early Toaplan games such as Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre. The player's helicopter can move in eight directions, though its move speed is fixed in relation to the stage's scroll speed. The player has 3 basic forms of attack: the machine gun, bombs, and options. The primary weapon is the machine gun, which can fire a continuous stream of bullets. Bombs unleash a screen-devastating blast, destroying most enemies instantly, and protects the player's ship from enemy fire. The player begins each life with three bombs and can accumulate up to six. Finally, the helicopter has three possible weapon assists, or \\"options\\", which provide extra firepower. The weapon options are a machine gun, cannon, and rocket grenade. Using the right one at any given time determines how tough certain battles and stages will be.  Development and release  Under Defeat was developed by G.rev for Sega's NAOMI arcade board. (Translation ) It was released in Japanese arcades on October 27, 2005, followed by a companion soundtrack release in December. A Dreamcast port was released on March 23, 2006, over five years after Sega announced they were pulling support for the system. G.rev promoted it as the last Dreamcast game, although Triggerheart Exelica and Karous were released for the system the following year. G.rev credited the promotion as helping its commercial success. It sold through its first printing within one week, becoming the best-selling game on the system since G.rev's own Border Down (2003). Dreamcast copies were released in limited numbers and continue to command high prices on secondary markets. A limited edition version with a pack-in soundtrack CD was also released (different from the soundtrack released earlier). Under Defeat HD In response to fan requests for a re- release, G.rev announced a high-definition version of Under Defeat for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2011. The re-release was titled Under Defeat HD published by Rising Star Games. Most of G.rev's recent games were Xbox 360 exclusives, so out of fear of being framed exclusively as Xbox 360 developers in the industry, they decided to create a PlayStation 3 port as well. In addition to digital storefronts, G.rev produced physical copies as a show of gratitude to their fans. An arcade version was released in 2013 as Under Defeat HD+. Building on the original, Under Defeat HD has a new gameplay mode, New Order mode, which stretches the gameplay to fill a 16:9 display and gives the player the ability to shoot at wider ranges. G.rev developed this mode in an effort to adapt the game for modern 16:9 displays. A new optional dual stick control setup was added as well. Under Defeat HD also has improved shadowing and textures. Because the textures were originally created in high resolution, the team used those to replace the lossy versions used in the original though some pixel art needed to be tediously enlarged. The team also needed to manually reproduce the deferred background polygon rendering, a process handled by PowerVR technology in the original arcade and Dreamcast hardware.  Reception  Reviewing the Dreamcast version, Edge and Eurogamer agreed that Under Defeat was traditional in its gameplay, absent of the more inventive bullet patterns, scoring methods, and controls seen in modern shooters. Edge wrote that it although it lacks the excitement of other shooters, it makes up for it through rewarding dedicated players. Eurogamer described it as \\"'80s gaming dressed in '00s visuals running on '90s hardware\\" and recommended it for shooter aficionados. They also argued that the scarcity of good shoot 'em ups may influence fans of the genre to overstate Under Defeat's quality. They concluded their thoughts by calling it \\"sweet and eloquent but, [...] also tired and relentlessly derivative. Whether that annoys you or not depends on whether you were looking simply some well-made twitch fun or a glorious resurrection.\\" Both publications praised the graphics, particularly the explosions and smoke effects. In a retrospective review, Retro Gamer praised the game's particle effects and wrote that Under Defeat \\"shows how, with good developers, the Dreamcast was perfectly capable of hanging with the competition.\\" Critics reviewing the high-definition version primarily recommended the game for fans of the shooter genre. Push Square wrote that its longevity was mostly in beating high scores, for better or worse. GameRevolution called it \\"a game trapped in time\\" for its traditional feel, but felt the game's unique controls will give satisfying nuance for shooter fans. Destructoid wrote that \\"getting used to Under Defeat‚Äôs controls is both the game's blessing and curse\\", believing that perhaps the game was developed for arcade sticks and a standard controller was not ideal. Critics overall praised the graphical improvements.

John was born in the region of Paphlagonia and his family is said to have been engaged in some disreputable trade, perhaps money-changing or, according to George Kedrenos, forgery. John was the eldest of five brothers. Two, Constantine and George, were also eunuchs, while the other two, Niketas and Michael, were 'bearded' men; the latter became Michael IV the Paphlagonian after John introduced him to the reigning empress Zo√´. According to Michael Psellos, the two became lovers and could have hatched a plot to assassinate Zo√´'s husband, then reigning. Romanos was presumably killed in his bath on 11 April 1034. Certain contemporary sources implicate John in this assassination. Background John first comes to historical attention as protonotarios and trusted confidant of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025). He supported Romanos' interests before the latter became emperor. After his elevation to the imperial throne, Romanos created John praepositus sacri cubiculi (head of the imperial household and the highest-ranking eunuch position; this title is probably identical with parakoimomenos) and senator. With the accession of Michael IV, John was able to pursue his goal of furthering his family's interest with vigour. The chronicler John Skylitzes goes so far as to say that 'with John's help all of his brothers became members of the emperor's household'. John ensured that his sister Maria's husband, Stephen, was made admiral, his brother Niketas named Duke of Antioch (succeeded by his brother Constantine), and his brother George named protovestiarios in succession to Symeon, who resigned from his position in protest at John's behaviour and retired to Mount Olympus. Anthony the Fat, a member of John's extended family, was named Bishop of Nicomedia. Although John himself ultimately remained only an orphanotrophos, he effectively ran the state as a sort of prime minister. In 1037, John attempted to have himself made Patriarch of Constantinople by trying unsuccessfully to have Alexius Studites dismissed from the patriarchate. John put Stephen in charge of the fleet bearing George Maniakes and his army to Sicily in 1038. After the disastrous desertions of the Normans, Salernitans, and Varangians from Maniakes' army, John recalled Maniakes and had him imprisoned. John appointed Michael Doukeianos catepan of Italy. Eyes on power As the epilepsy afflicting Michael IV worsened, John's grip on power tightened. John convinced the empress to adopt Stephen's son Michael as her own, thus ensuring the continuation of the Paphlagonian line. Michael IV died on 10 December 1041, possibly in suspicious circumstances, and Michael V succeeded him. Having seen Michael elevated to the imperial throne, John made his nephew Constantine his prot√©g√© with the object, according to Psellos, of ensuring his succession. Michael V exiled John to the Monastery of Monobatae in 1041 and then, again according to Psellos, had all of John's male relatives castrated. John and his brother Constantine were blinded in 1042 on the orders of the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael I Cerularius. In the reign of Constantine IX, John was sent to Lesbos and died there on 13 May 1043. John's position at the head of the state, his ability to stay in power notwithstanding the installation of new emperors, and his shrewd pursuit of his family's interests make him one of the most fascinating eunuchs in Byzantine history. As Psellos' description of him in Book 4 of his Chronographia shows, he was a very complex figure who could elicit equal measures of esteem and loathing in the same chronicler. References *Charles M.

Imagined geographies refers to the perception of a space created through certain imagery, texts, and/or discourses. For Said, imagined does not mean to be false or made-up, but rather is used synonymous with perceived. Despite often being constructed on a national level, imagined geographies also occur domestically in nations and locally within regions, cities, etc. Imagined geographies can be seen as a form of social constructionism on par with Benedict Anderson's concept of imagined communities. Edward Said's notion of Orientalism is tied to the tumultuous dynamics of contemporary history. Orientalism is often referred to as the West's patronizing perceptions and depictions of the East, but more specifically towards Islamic and Confucian states. Orientalism has also been labeled to as the cornerstone of postcolonial studies. This theory has also been used to critique several geographies created; both historically and contemporarily‚Äîan example is Maria Todorova's work Imagining the Balkans. Samuel P. Huntington's Clash of Civilizations has also been criticized as showing a whole set of imagined geographies. Halford Mackinder's \\"imperial gaze\\" has also been argued to be an important imagined geography that emphasised the importance of the British Empire over colonial peoples, and asserted the view of the geographical \\"expert\\" with the \\"God's eye view\\". Orientalism In his book Orientalism, Edward Said argued that Western culture had produced a view of the \\"Orient\\" based on a particular imagination, popularized through academic Oriental studies, travel writing, anthropology and a colonial view of the Orient. This imagination included painting the orient as feminine- however, Said's view on the gendered nature has been criticized by other scholars due to a limited exploration of the construct.Sharp, Joanne P. \\"Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch. 1, Imagining the World.\\" London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009. p. 27 At a 1993 lecture located at York University, Toronto, Canada, Said stressed the role culture plays in Orientalism-based imperialism and colonialism.Edward Said. \\"Culture and Imperialism\\" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993. By differentiating and elevating a national culture over another a validating process of \\"othering\\" is undertaken.Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 \\"The Other\\". 328-329. This process underlies imagined geographies such as orientalism as it creates a set of preconceived notions for self-serving purposes.Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 \\"The Other\\"; Edward Said. \\"Culture and Imperialism\\" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993. In constructing itself as superior, the imperial force or colonizing agent is able to justify its actions as somehow necessary or beneficial to the \\"other\\". Despite the broad scope and affect of orientalism as an imagined geography, it and the underlying process of \\"othering\\" are discursive and thereby normalized within dominant, Western societies.Joanne P. Sharp. Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch.1 \\"Imagining the World\\". 19-20. It is in this sense that Orientalism may be reinforced in cultural texts such as art, film, literature, music, etc. where one-dimensional and often backwards constructions prevail.Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 8-10. A prime source of cinematic examples is the documentary-film Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.Sut Jhally. Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People. The film demonstrates the process of orientalism centric \\"othering\\" within Western films from the silent era to modern classics such as Disney's Aladdin. Inferior, backwards, and culturally stagnate constructions of Oriental \\"others\\" become normalized in the minds of Western consumers of cultural texts; reinforcing racist or insensitive beliefs and assumptions.Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 10-11. In Orientalism, Said says that Orientalism is an imagined geography because a) Europeans created one culture for the entirety of the 'Orient', and b) the 'Orient' was defined by text and not by the 'Orient'. Theory Said was heavily influenced by French philosopher Michel Foucault, and those who have developed the theory of imagined geographies have linked these together. Foucault states that power and knowledge are always intertwined. Said then developed an idea of a relationship between power and descriptions. Imagined geographies are thus seen as a tool of power, of a means of controlling and subordinating areas. Power is seen as being in the hands of those who have the right to objectify those that they are imagining. Imagined geographies were mostly based on myth and legend, often depicting monstrous \\"others\\". Edward Said elaborates that: ‚ÄúEurope is powerful and articulate; Asia is defeated and distant.\\" Said, Edward. ‚ÄúImaginative Geography and Its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental.‚Äù Orientalism. New York: Vintage, 1979. Further writers to have been heavily influenced by the concept of imagined geographies including Derek Gregory and Gear√≥id √ì Tuathail. Gregory argues that the War on Terror shows a continuation of the same imagined geographies that Said uncovered. He claims that the Islamic world is portrayed as uncivilized; it is labeled as backward and failing. This justifies, in the view of those imagining, the military intervention that has been seen in Afghanistan and Iraq. Edward Said mentions that when Islam appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, the response was conservative and defensive. √ì' Tuathail has argued that geopolitical knowledges are forms of imagined geography. Using the example of Halford Mackinder's heartland theory, he has shown how the presentation of Eastern Europe / Western Russia as a key geopolitical region after the First World War influenced actions such as the recreation of Poland and the Polish Corridor in the 1918 Treaty of Versailles.

The disaster was reported by several news outlets including the Calgary Herald as the world's third-worst mine disaster. Explosion The mine started operations at 7:00 a.m. on the morning of June 19, 1914. At approximately 9:30 a.m. an explosion ripped through the tunnels, up the slopes and burst from the entries of the mine. John Brown, the general manager of the mine, rushed to the fan room to reverse the suction of air, which would push depleted oxygen back into the mine in an attempt to save any survivors. Initial rescue efforts were hampered by the complete destruction of the one entrance to the mine. Of the 237 men who entered the mine that day, only 48 were rescued, many of whom suffering from the effects of toxic gases. Aftermath The accident had a profound effect on the town of Hillcrest Mines, which in 1914 had a population of about 1,000. A total of 189 workers died, about half of the mine's total workforce, which left 90 women widowed and about 250 children fatherless. Many of the victims were buried in a mass grave at the Hillcrest Cemetery. The Government of Alberta held an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the explosion in 1915. Condolences came from across the country, including a brief message from King George V, but the commencement of World War I soon overshadowed this event. Of the 189 victims of the disaster, many were immigrants, including 43 from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, of whom an estimated 30 were Ukrainian by ethnic origin, including 6 from one village, Karliv (now Prutivka), Galicia. Operations at Hillcrest mine continued until Hillcrest Collieries, the mine owners, went into liquidation in April 1938, and the mine was officially closed on December 2, 1939. A monument to the Hillcrest mine disaster and the lives lost was placed at the Hillcrest Cemetery. In 1990, Canadian folk-singer James Keelaghan recorded \\"Hillcrest Mine\\", one of his best-known songs. The disaster is also featured in the song \\"Coal Miner\\" (album Heads Is East, Tails Is West, 2014) by Joal Kamps, an Alberta-based Rocky Mountain folk-pop singer. Other area mining accidents On September 19, 1926, another explosion occurred in the Hillcrest mine when the mine was idle, killing two men. Other explosions at other coal mines within the Crowsnest Pass region also caused deaths: *Coal Creek, 1902 (128 men killed) *Michel, 1904 (7) *Coleman, 1907 (3) *Bellevue, 1910 (30) *Michel, 1916 (12) *Coal Creek, 1917 (34) *Coleman, 1926 (10) *Michel, 1938 (3) ReferencesExternal links *Anderson, Frank W.

The party was founded in 1995 by four Labour Party borough councillors who had been suspended from Labour for opposing a reduction in the housing budget. It was initially known as the People's Labour Party, and stood their chair, Jim Hamezeian, in the Barrow and Furness constituency in the 1997 general election. He received 1,995 votes, 4.1% of the total in the constituency. The party campaigned on a variety of local issues. A split led to two of its four councillors leaving and standing as independents in the 2003 local elections; the two People's Party councillors then lost their seats. However, in the 2006 local elections, party leader Jim Hamezian regained his seat in the Ormsgill ward. In the 2008 local elections, one councillor was elected in Central Ward and three others elected in Ormsgill. Following this, in elections to Cumbria County Council in 2009, Jim Hamezeian was elected to serve for Ormsgill ward in Barrow-in-Furness. After that, the party's support dropped: in the 2010 local elections the SPP lost two councillors, and lost all representation on the Borough council in 2011 local elections.

Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal South African English. When the letter \\"g\\" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Words ending in \\"-ng\\" are pronounced identical to those in English. In most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the \\"d\\" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the \\"n\\" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; \\"tooth\\"), formal = \\"tande\\", informal = \\"tanne\\". In singular words' syllables ending in \\"-d\\", \\"-nd\\" and \\"-heid\\", the \\"d\\" is always pronounced as a \\"t\\". For example: \\"ge-son(t)-hei(t)\\" (gesondheid, \\"health\\"). The English term slang is used strictly in its English pronunciation in context, as the Afrikaans word of the same spelling (though pronounced as \\"slung\\") translates as \\"snake\\". Fanakalo (fanagalo) also refers to when people of non-Zulu origin attempt to speak Zulu without the proper pronunciation and throat sounds. Fanakalo in Zulu literally means \\"same as this\\" ‚Äì (fana ‚Äì same, ka ‚Äì as, lo ‚Äì this). Another common slang-phrase you can find is ‚ÄúSizoba grand sonke‚Äù is a Zulu phrase by S.

In the first stage, a small group of investors back operating managers to search for a target company to acquire. A fund may or may not find a target acquisition company. Investors are able to invest a pro-rata share in the target company, subject to their individual liking. In the second stage, the general managers of the search fund take operating roles in the acquired company, such as CEO and President. Search funds typically target companies in the $5 million to $50 million price range, requiring $2 million to $10 million of equity capital, in fragmented industries, with sustainable market positions, histories of stable cash flows, and long term opportunities for improvement and growth. Service and light manufacturing companies outside high tech industries are popular targets. Often these companies are under-managed prior to the acquisition. Most search funds are started by entrepreneurs with limited operational experience and possibly no direct experience in the target industry. The goal of the investor is to place promising, motivated managers in an environment with a high probability for success given the oversight and experience of the investors themselves. The origins of the search fund are often traced back to H. Irving Grousbeck, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, who originated the concept in 1984. Since then, it is estimated that 627 traditional funds have been or are currently being formed, with 198 operating currently. The bulk of successful search funds have been raised by alumni of elite MBA programs with access to strong private equity networks. Stanford University has documented more than 177 search funds.

He is also a member of the rap group \\"Golden State Project\\" (formerly known as Golden State Warriors) with Ras Kass and Xzibit. Born in Oakland, California, he lived with Tupac Shakur and became a dancer for Digital Underground. Saafir took part in one of the most notorious Bay Area rap battles, when he and members of the Hobo Junction went against Casual and members of the Hieroglyphics Crew. The battle took place live on KMEL. Saafir made his recording debut on several cuts on Digital Underground's The Body-Hat Syndrome in 1993, followed by an appearance on Casual's Fear Itself in early 1994. He appeared in the film Menace II Society as Harold Lawson and was featured on the film's soundtrack. With a deal from Qwest Records, Saafir recruited the Hobo Junction production team (J Groove, J.Z., Rational, Big Nose, and Poke Martian) for his freestyle debut, Boxcar Sessions (1994). He recorded an album called Trigonometry under the alias Mr. No No before returning as Saafir in The Hit List (1999). The Hit List was considered Saafir's attempt at commercial acceptance. The album featured production by Stevie J (made famous for his work with P. Diddy's Hitmen production team) and guest vocals from West Coast heavyweights Kam and Jayo Felony and controversial East Coast lyricist Chino XL. In 2006, he released his fourth album, Good Game: The Transition (ABB Records, 2006). The album covers the major transitions throughout his life, most notably his spinal tumor, and his conversion to Islam. In February 2013 on Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner, Digital Underground leader Shock-G revealed that Saafir had begun using a wheelchair due to complications from his spinal surgery.} Saafir later appeared on Sway & King Tech's The Wake Up Show to confirm his condition and clear up some of the misconceptions stemming from Shock-G's announcement. Saafir was one of the passengers flying on TWA Flight 843; he suffered a back injury as a consequence of evacuating an aborted takeoff and consequent hard landing, crash and fire on July 30, 1992. Starting in 2012 Saaifr's son, Saafir Gibson began to release music under the moniker Saafir.

It served as a royal treasury for the caliphs and sultans, managing personal finances and government expenditures. Further, it administered distributions of zakat revenues for public works. Modern Islamic economists deem the institutional framework appropriate for contemporary Islamic societies. History Bayt al-mal was the department that dealt with the revenues and all other economical matters of the state. In the time of Muhammad there was no permanent Bait-ul-Mal or public treasury. Whatever revenues or other amounts were received were distributed immediately. During Prophethood the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting 800000 dirham which was distributed in just one sitting. There were no salaries to be paid, and there was no state expenditure. Hence the need for the treasury at public level was not felt. In the time of Abu Bakr as well there was no treasury. Abu Bakr earmarked a house where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At the time of the death of Abu Bakr there was only one dirham in the public treasury. Establishment of Bait-ul-Maal In the time of Umar things changed. With the extension in conquests money came in larger quantities, Umar also allowed salaries to men fighting in the army. Abu Huraira who was the Governor of Bahrain sent a revenue of five hundred thousand dirhams. Umar summoned a meeting of his Consultative Assembly and sought the opinion of the Companions about the disposal of the money. Uthman ibn Affan advised that the amount should be kept for future needs. Walid bin Hisham suggested that like the Byzantines, separate departments of Treasury and Accounts should be set up. After consulting the Companions Umar decided to establish the Central Treasury at Madinah. Abdullah bin Arqam was appointed as the Treasury Officer. He was assisted by Abdur Rahman bin Awf and Muiqib. A separate Accounts Department was also set up and it was required to maintain record of all that was spent. Later provincial treasuries were set up in the provinces. After meeting the local expenditure the provincial treasuries were required to remit the surplus amount to the central treasury at Madinah. According to Yaqubi the salaries and stipends charged to the central treasury amounted to over 30 million dirhams. The coins were of Persian origin, and had an image of the last Persian emperor, Muslim added the sentence Bismillah to it. A separate building was constructed for the royal treasury by the name bait ul maal, which in large cities was guarded by as many as 400 guards. In most of the historical accounts, it states that among the Rashidun caliphs, Uthman ibn Affan was first to struck the coins, some accounts however states that Umar was first to do so. When Persia was conquered three types of coins were current in the conquered territories, namely Baghli of 8 dang; Tabari of 4 dang; and Maghribi of 3 dang. Umar ( according to some accounts Uthman ) made an innovation and struck an Islamic dirham of 6 dang. Charity The concepts of welfare and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of Zakat (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century. This practice continued well into the Abbasid era of the Caliphate. The taxes (including Zakat and Jizya) collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058‚Äì1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. Thus, according to Shadi Hamid, the Caliphate can be considered the world's first major \\"welfare state\\". (see online ) Dome of the treasury at The Umayyad Mosque in Damascus During the Rashidun Caliphate, various welfare programs were introduced by Caliph Umar. Umar himself lived \\"a simple life and detached himself from any of the worldly luxuries,\\" like how he often wore \\"worn-out shoes and was usually clad in patched-up garments,\\" or how he would sleep \\"on the bare floor of the mosque.\\" Limitations on wealth were also set for governors and officials, who would often be \\"dismissed if they showed any outward signs of pride or wealth which might distinguish them from the people.\\" This was an early attempt at erasing \\"class distinctions which might inevitably lead to conflict.\\" Umar also made sure that the public treasury was not wasted on \\"unnecessary luxuries\\" as he believed that \\"the money would be better spent if it went towards the welfare of the people rather than towards lifeless bricks.\\" Umar's innovative welfare reforms during the Rashidun Caliphate included the introduction of social security. In the Rashidun Caliphate, whenever citizens were injured or lost their ability to work, it became the state's responsibility to make sure that their minimum needs were met, with the unemployed and their families receiving an allowance from the public treasury. Retirement pensions were provided to elderly people, who had retired and could \\"count on receiving a stipend from the public treasury.\\" Babies who were abandoned were also taken care of, with one hundred dirhams spent annually on each orphan‚Äôs development. Umar also introduced the concept of public trusteeship and public ownership when he implemented the Waqf, or charitable trust, system, which transferred \\"wealth from the individual or the few to a social collective ownership,\\" in order to provide \\"services to the community at large.\\" For example, Umar brought land from the Banu Harithah and converted it into a charitable trust, which meant that \\"profit and produce from the land went towards benefiting the poor, slaves, and travelers.\\" During the great famine of 18 AH (638 CE), Umar introduced further reforms, such as the introduction of food rationing using coupons, which were given to those in need and could be exchanged for wheat and flour. Another innovative concept that was introduced was that of a poverty threshold, with efforts made to ensure a minimum standard of living, making sure that no citizen across the empire would suffer from hunger. In order to determine the poverty line, Umar ordered an experiment to test how many seers of flour would be required to feed a person for a month. He found that 25 seers of flour could feed 30 people, and so he concluded that 50 seers of flour would be sufficient to feed a person for a month. As a result, he ordered that the poor each receive a food ration of fifty seers of flour per month. In addition, the poor and disabled were guaranteed cash stipends. However, in order to avoid some citizens taking advantage of government services, \\"begging and laziness were not tolerated\\" and \\"those who received government benefits were expected to be contributing members in the community.\\" Further reforms later took place under the Umayyad Caliphate. Registered soldiers who were disabled in service received an invalidity pension, while similar provisions were made for the disabled and poor in general. Caliph Al-Walid I assigned payments and services to the needy, which included money for the poor, guides for the blind, and servants for the crippled, and pensions for all disabled people so that they would never need to beg. The caliphs Al-Walid II and Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz supplied money and clothes to the blind and crippled, as well as servants for the latter. This continued with the Abbasid caliph Al-Mahdi. Tahir ibn Husayn, governor of the Khurasan province of the Abbasid Caliphate, states in a letter to his son that pensions from the treasury should be provided to the blind, to look after the poor and destitute in general, to make sure not to overlook victims of oppression who are unable to complain and are ignorant of how to claim their rights, and that pensions should be assigned to victims of calamities and the widows and orphans they leave behind. The \\"ideal city\\" described by the Islamic philosophers, Al-Farabi and Avicenna, also assigns funds to the disabled. When communities were stricken by famine, rulers would often support them though measures such as the remission of taxes, importation of food, and charitable payments, ensuring that everyone had enough to eat. However, private charity through the Waqf trust institution often played a greater role in the alleviation of famines than government measures did. From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the Waqf (charitable trusts) for the purpose of building and supporting public institutions, often Madrassah educational institutions and Bimaristan hospitals.

They are created in the aftermath of a conflict or natural disaster as a temporary residence for victims who have lost or abandoned their homes. Refugees and IDPs are people fleeing their homes or countries of origin due to natural disasters, war and political or religious persecution in search of refuge and resettlement. Living in these shelters refugees may force marriage crowded, noisy, dirty, disease filled grounds where thousands of families are cramped together and surviving day by day.UNHCR: The UN Refugee Agency.\\" UNHCR News. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Nov. 2013. . Nyanzale camp, DR Congo Refugees and IDPs can often be found living in refugee camps or IDP camps and in these shelters for upwards of a decade. Design models, disaster-relief programs, and land tenure issues play a large role in the progression of recovery and categorization of settlements as temporary. Aims The design of temporary houses is especially important as these are the first spaces that provide a degree of normality after the disaster. Temporary housing is initially modeled only to account for vital and functional needs of victims during the period of resettlement. Agencies design their models with the premise of meeting the individuals‚Äô basic needs in addition to creating awareness regarding the need for a ‚Äúhome‚Äù instead of merely a shelter after a forced resettlement.Yuksel, B. and Hasirci D. \\"An Analysis of Physical and Psychological Expectations of Earthquake Victims from Temporary Shelters: A Design Proposal.\\" METU JFA 29 (2012): 225‚Äì40. After disasters, since people suffer a complete break in the social, economic, and physical aspects of life, there is an urgent need for protection and shelter.Yuksel, B. and Hasirci D. \\"An Analysis of Physical and Psychological Expectations of Earthquake Victims from Temporary Shelters: A Design Proposal.\\" METU JFA 29 (2012): 225‚Äì40 Temporary housing with minimum living conditions are almost always limited and loosely involve spaces to live, sleep and socialize as well as areas for food preparation, personal hygiene, and privacy. The basic stages and design of a post-disaster environment aim to create an ideal situation including temporary housing that is practical, aids in psychological recovery, and is environmentally sensitive. Bamboo and thatch houses built by refugees in Nong Samet Refugee Camp on the Thai-Cambodian border, May 1984 Living conditions Disasters, particularly those triggered by nature, are often followed by a swift humanitarian relief response. Emergency humanitarian relief focuses on responding to the immediate need for restoration of basic services, medical treatment and medical supplies, food, and temporary shelter; and is a short- term, strenuous and often improvised effort. Unlike most normal construction projects, post-disaster housing projects are diverse in nature, have unique socio-cultural and economical requirements and are extremely dynamic. Due to the immediate need of resources, shelter, and medical services created by disaster or conflict, a quick, affordable, and available solution in the form of tents is usually implemented. The aim of refugee shelter is to protect families from outside dangers and create spaces inside to protect their privacy and bring back feelings of security. Tents For the majority of refugee and IDP populations under direct aid via government or humanitarian relief groups, camps of thousands live in small scout-style tents.Al-Khatib, Issam A., and Ahmad Ju'ba. \\"Impact of Housing Conditions on the Health of the People at Al-Ama'ri Refugee Camp in the West Bank of Palestine.\\"International Journal of Environmental Health Research 13.4 (2003): 315‚Äì26. Print. These emergency shelters consist of unplanned and spontaneously sought locations that are intended only to provide protection from the elements and typically constructed in large open areas. Simple tent structures, grouped together to form a \\"tent city\\", are commonly made of canvas military issue tents which are criticized for being heavy, bulky, uninsulated, poorly made and for rotting in under a year.Murphy, Denis, and David Ndegwa. \\"Mental Health of Refugees in Inner-London.\\"Psychiatric Bulletin 26.6 (2002): n. pag. Print. Extensive issues ‚Äì e.g. they soon become crowded, uncomfortable, and unsafe ‚Äì have been encountered in refugee camps throughout the world. Shelter from tarp and sticks Secondary disaster Temporary housing situations often lack several qualities of homes that are significant at this stage for victims, such as windows, warmth, color, space, and security.Evans & Wells, 2003, p485 The problem of noise also contributes negatively to the privacy of the residents of temporary houses. Sounds of crying people after an earthquake or other disaster are chronic in neighboring houses. Additional damage is caused by rain, leading to floods, and gas leaks which often create fires. In these secondary disasters, temporary housing units frequently become dysfunctional, and the disaster-victims become homeless once again.Rueff, H., and A. Viaro. \\"Palestinian Refugee Camps: From Shelter to Habitat.\\" Refugee Survey Quarterly 28.2‚Äì3 (2010): 339‚Äì59 Other problems have been described as such: lack of privacy, lack of private life; lack of space; all family members forced to sleep in the same space; lack of opportunity to consider feelings of others, including fear, sadness and grief; weather conditions; disease-ridden; the presence of public toilets and their sanitation; considerations of hygiene; toilets constantly being blocked; lack of water, including for laundry and dish-washing; heating, cooling, electricity problems; humidity; leakage of rain water into the housing space; the presence of insects; lack of windows; lack of sunlight in the houses; transportation to and from the housing location; difficulty of obtaining food; and insufficient quantity of shelters. All this can be perceived, by the victims, as secondary disaster. A quote from a journalist recording the daily lives of refugees in Palestine expresses her feelings after visiting a camp for the first time: :\\"Entering the refugee camp, I feel I am entering some medieval ghetto. I walk along a narrow alleyway, skirting an open sewage ditch. I pass tens of dozens of one and two- room houses, each leaning on the other for support. I am in a ghetto without streets, sidewalks, gardens, patios, trees, flowers, plazas, or shops‚Äîamong an uprooted, stateless, scattered people who, like the Jews before them, are in a tragic diaspora. I pass scores of small children, the third generation of Palestinians born in the ghetto that has almost as long a history as the state of Israel itself. Someone has said that for every Jew who was brought in to create a new state, a Palestinian Arab was uprooted and left homeless.\\"Halsell, Grace. Journey to Jerusalem. New York: Macmillan, 1999. Print. Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire Design considerations When considering emergency, temporary, housing the following revolve around the success of such shelter and relief efforts:Wardak, Zabihullah S. \\"Rebuilding Housing after a Disaster: Factors for Failure.\\" (2012): 292‚Äì99. * cost (how much per shelter? cost of resources? cost of living?) * availability (are necessary resources available? are they available under pressure/time? who will provide them?) * transport time (how long to require necessary materials?) * setup time (how long does it take to set up? how many people does it require? what if pieces are missing?) * quality (what is it made of? does it protect from the environment?) * durability (how long is it meant to last? can it easily be damaged, if so can it be fixed?) * size (number of persons per room. kitchen? wash space? sleep space?) * security (does the house have a lock? are there windows? is it surrounded by other emergency shelters? can belongings be left safely?) * weather proof (protection from environmental conditions, extreme heat, extreme cold, winds, rains) * design / look (color? aesthetics? is it culturally sensitive? religious space? is it near nature?) * privacy (separate rooms? locks on doors?) * noise * cleanliness * distance to work/ school/ religious services/ washroom. The questions presented above are often incompletely answered and accounted for when preparing for a post-disaster settlement. User involvement Since the most effective relief and reconstruction policies result from the participation of survivors in determining and planning their own needs, the successful performance of assisting groups is dependent on the accountability to appeal to and include local aid. Psychologists and humanitarian groups suggest that it is advantageous for both individual and community participation in the financing of their own shelter programs, especially permanent reconstruction. Incorporation of potential users not only with regard to having a say in the shelter, but also in the design, planning and constructing of the shelters has been shown to contribute to pain relief and suffering.Wardak, Zabihullah S. \\"Rebuilding Housing after a Disaster: Factors for Failure.\\" (2012): 292‚Äì99. Architects and psychologists have been in collaboration to construct design models that are holistic and functional, providing for both the most basic, physical needs as well as the psychological expectations from a post-disaster reality.  Roles and responsibilities  In some cases, the entire burden of assistance and relief is placed on the national government, whereas in others, responsibility is varied across multiple levels of government and outside aid. Reconstruction is closely linked to land tenure, government policy, and all aspects of land-use and infrastructure planning. Resource management and availability is always a consistent issue in emergency recovery however there has been success when relief is found as locally as possible. Refugee camp, Chad The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or UNHCR, is a United Nations agency that protects and supports refugees. When the UNHCR was first established, material aspects of refugee relief (e.g., housing, food) were seen to be the responsibility of the hosting government. As many of the world's more recent major refugee communities have occurred in less developed countries, the UNHCR has acquired the additional role of coordinating material assistance for refugees and returnees. Although this was not UNHCR's original mandate, coordination of material assistance has become one of its principal functions alongside protection and the promotion of solutions.  Innovative practices  There are scores of innovative approaches to constructing temporary shelters, but few make it to the field. Architect Shigeru Ban has designed temporary and permanent structures with paper tubes as the underlying structure, used after the Kobe earthquake. Cal-Earth Institute has also developed \\"superadobe\\" which makes use of sandbags and barbed wire to form an emergency shelter for disaster relief. Shigeru Ban is a Japanese architect famous for innovation with recycled paper/cardboard and has quickly and effectively housed disaster victims. He began working with cardboard tubing in cooperation with the UNHCR during the humanitarian crisis of war-torn Rwanda in 1994. Designed for easy construction by an unskilled labor force, each barn-shaped unit consists of a paper tube frame covered with plastic tarps. Polyurethane-coated cylinders are linked together with plywood joints and rope, resulting in a very stable, waterproof structure that maximizes internal space. Sand filled crates acts as a platform and floor for the shelters and protects from floods, rain, and snow. The paper is low cost low tech, recyclable, and replaceable. As designed the shelters take less than six hours to construct. In addition, the social enterprise Better Shelter and the UNHCR have developed a modular refugee shelter in collaboration with the IKEA Foundation (philanthropic arm of a large furniture company notable for its user-friendly setup and mass production). These models include light-weight polymer panels attached to a steel frame. They take only about four hours to assemble and come flat-packed with panels, pipes, connectors, and wires, with a solar-powered LED light inside with a USB outlet. Despite numerous attempts ‚Äî Shigeru Ban's cardboard houses, the Better Shelter flat-pack shelter, the superadobe, and more ‚Äî designing the appropriate shelter that encompasses all the necessary characteristics for refugees continues to be an ongoing process involving architects and psychologists alike.

It was Rousseau's first successful published philosophical work, and it was the first expression of his influential views about nature vs. society, to which he would dedicate the rest of his intellectual life. This work is considered one of his most important works. Topic of the essay Rousseau wrote Discourse in response to an advertisement that appeared in a 1749 issue of Mercure de France, in which the Academy of Dijon set a prize for an essay responding to the question: \\"Has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to the purification of morals?\\" According to Rousseau, \\"Within an instant of reading this [advertisement], I saw another universe and became another man.\\" Rousseau found the idea to which he would passionately dedicate the rest of his intellectual life: the destructive influence of civilization on human beings. Rousseau went on to win first prize in the contest and‚Äîin an otherwise mundane career as composer and playwright, among other things‚Äîhe had newfound fame as a philosopher. Scholar Jeff J.S. Black points out that Rousseau is one of the first thinkers within the modern democratic tradition to question the political commitment to scientific progress found in most modern societies (especially liberal democracies) and examined the costs of such policies. In the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences, Rousseau \\"authored a scathing attack on scientific progress...an attack whose principles he never disavowed, and whose particulars he repeated, to some extent, in each of his subsequent writings.\\" Rousseau's account about his initial encounter with the question has become well known. Rousseau's friend Denis Diderot had been imprisoned at Vincennes for writing a work questioning the idea of a providential God. As he walked to the prison to visit him, Rousseau was perusing a copy of the Mercury of France, and when his eyes fell upon the question posed by the Academy of Dijon, he felt a sudden and overwhelming inspiration \\"that man is naturally good, and that it is from these institutions alone that men become wicked\\". Rousseau was able to retain only some of the thoughts, the \\"crowd of truths\\", that flowed from that idea‚Äîthese eventually found their way into his Discourses and his novel Emile. In his work Rousseau, Judge of Jean-Jacques, Rousseau used a fictional Frenchman as a literary device to lay out his intent in the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences and his other systematic works. The character explains that Rousseau was showing the \\"great principle that nature made man happy and good, but that society depraves him and makes him miserable....vice and error, foreign to his constitution, enter it from outside and insensibly change him.\\" The character describes the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences as an effort \\"to destroy that magical illusion which gives us a stupid admiration for the instruments of our misfortunes and [an attempt] to correct that deceptive assessment that makes us honor pernicious talents and scorn useful virtues. Throughout he makes us see the human race as better, wiser, and happier in its primitive constitution; blind, miserable, and wicked to the degree that it moves away from it. His goal is to rectify the error of our judgements in order to delay the progress of our vices, and to show us that where we seek glory and renown, we in fact find only error and miseries\\". An example of one of \\"those metaphysical subtleties\\" that Rousseau may have been referring to was the consideration of materialism or Epicureanism. Scholar Victor Gourevitch, examining Rousseau's Letter to Voltaire, notes: \\"Although he returns to the problem of materialism throughout his life, Rousseau does not ever discuss it at any length. He chooses to write from the perspective of the ordinary course of things, and philosophical materialism breaks with the ordinary course of things. It is what he early called one of those metaphysical subtleties that do not directly affect the happiness of mankind\\". The line with which Rousseau opens the discourse is a quote in Latin from Horace's On the Art of Poetry (line 25), which translates into: \\"We are deceived by the appearance of right.\\" Response Rousseau anticipated that his response would cause \\"a universal outcry against me\\", but held that \\"a few sensible men\\" would appreciate his position. He holds that this will be because he has dismissed the concerns of \\"men born to be in bondage to the opinions of the society in which they live in.\\" In this he includes \\"wits\\" and \\"those who follow fashion\\". He maintains that those who reflexively support traditional thinking merely \\"play the free-thinker and the philosopher\\", and had they lived during the age of the French Wars of Religion these same people would have joined the Catholic League and \\"been no more than fanatics\\" advocating the use of force to suppress Protestants. Oddly Rousseau, who claims to be motivated by the idea of bringing forth something to promote the happiness of mankind, sets most of humanity as his adversaries. Scholar Jeff J. S. Black points out that this is because Rousseau wants his work to outlive him. Rousseau holds that if he wrote things that were popular with the fashionable and trendy, his work would fade with the passing of fashion, \\"To live beyond one's century, then, one must appeal to principles that are more lasting and to readers who are less thoughtless.\\" Rousseau's argument was controversial, and drew a great number of responses. One from critic Jules Lema√Ætre calling the instant deification of Rousseau as 'one of the strongest proofs of human stupidity.' Rousseau himself answered five of his critics in the two years or so after he won the prize. Among these five answers were replies to Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, King of Poland, M. l'Abbe Raynal, and the \\"Last Reply\\" to M. Charles Bordes. These responses provide clarification for Rousseau's argument in the Discourse, and begin to develop a theme he further advances in the Discourse on Inequality ‚Äì that misuse of the arts and sciences is one case of a larger theme, that man, by nature good, is corrupted by civilization. Inequality, luxury, and the political life are identified as especially harmful. Rousseau's own assessment of the essay was ambiguous. In one letter he described it as one of his \\"principal writings,\\" and one of only three in which his philosophical system is developed (the others being the Discourse on Inequality and Emile), but in another instance he evaluated it as \\"at best mediocre.\\"Campbell (1975), 9.

It debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their fifth consecutive single to chart within the top three. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Ireland and certain European territories. In 2006, it charted at number 67 on Australia's singles chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Trudy Bellinger, and portrays the five members as characters working in a salon. To promote the song, Girls Aloud performed \\"The Show\\" at the 2004 Royal Variety Performance and at London gay nightclub G-A-Y. It was also performed on five of the group's concert tours. Background and release Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following the success of their debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004. For the lead single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, Polydor presented the band four singles choices, including \\"The Show\\", \\"Wake Me Up\\", \\"Graffiti My Soul\\", and \\"Androgynous Girls\\". Although \\"Wake Me Up\\" was the preferred choice, it was deemed too hard sounding and the record company didn't want to take the risk, and they also added \\"Androgynous Girls\\" as a b-side to the album's second single three months later. \\"The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio,\\" Higgins said. They decided to release \\"The Show\\", which was debuted on 28 June 2004, less than six months after the release of \\"Jump\\". It was released on two different CD single formats, but did not feature any new b-sides. A remix of \\"Jump\\" appears on the first disc, while the Gravitas Club Mix of \\"The Show\\" and an exclusive interview both appeared on the second disc. \\"The Show\\" was also released in Australia two years later, on 3 June 2006, as the second single from the Australian version of Chemistry. Composition The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Lisa Cowling, Jon Shave, and Tim Powell. Contrary to the verse-chorus form that is typically used in modern pop music, \\"The Show\\" opts for a less conventional song structure. It was noted for its intricacy. The song's lyrics, which contain an anti-promiscuity message, \\"set in motion a writing style that would come to epitomise Girls Aloud's music.\\" In the group's 2008 autobiography Dreams That Glitter - Our Story, Cheryl Cole described Girls Aloud's cover of the Pointer Sisters' \\"Jump\\" as \\"the point when we realized everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted.\\" As their first single following the cover, \\"The Show\\" served as an introduction to Girls Aloud's new sound, being \\"their most risqu√© cut at the time.\\" Rather than the guitar that dominated the band's first three singles, \\"The Show\\" mostly utilises synthesisers. The synth rhythm was composed by a Xenomania musician named Jon Shave. MusicOMH contributor John Murphy deemed the track's composition similar to \\"Love Machine\\", which he considered inspired by \\"'80s synth pop.\\" Reception=Critical response Girls Aloud performing \\"The Show\\" on the What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour (2005). \\"The Show\\" was described by BBC Music as \\"a feisty, thumping track with a positively rude bassline,\\" while a reviewer for Virgin Media described the song as a \\"rush of thrilling synth stabs and natty vocal hooks.\\" Paul Scott of Stylus Magazine referred to \\"The Show\\" as one of Girls Aloud's best songs, deeming it \\"audacious to say the least. With its clipped delivery and gnarled synth riffs barely sweetened, it‚Äôs SAW doing SST; tungsten and gristle polished to an FM sheen.\\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian considered \\"The Show\\" and \\"Love Machine\\" as the perfect examples of Xenomania's unique production, and added that the lead single \\"is based around a frantically exciting electronic noise that seems to have escaped from an early-1990s rave record.\\" In their best-of-year countdown, The Times noted that the song helped Xenomania to establish themselves as the best pop music production team. Chart performance On the week ending 17 July 2004, \\"The Show\\" debuted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, being held off the top spot by Usher's \\"Burn\\". It fell to number 5 the following week. \\"The Show\\" is Girls Aloud 17th best-selling single in the United Kingdom. The single also debuted and peaked at number 9 on the European Hot 100 Singles, falling to number 18 the following week. In Ireland, it debuted at number ten, and peaked at number 5 three weeks later. After its release in Australia in 2006, \\"The Show\\" failed to make impact and missed the top forty of the ARIA Charts, debuting and peaking at number 67. Music video The accompanying music video for \\"The Show\\" was directed by Trudy Bellinger.The Show liner notes. Polydor Records (2004) After the video shoot, Girls Aloud decided it was time to change their choreographer, hiring Beth Honan, who continued to work with the band for several years. Walsh also said that the music video for \\"The Show\\" was her least favourite from the band. The story takes place in a salon called \\"Curls Allowed.\\" Each member of the band plays a character working in the salon, pampering and making-up a variety of men. Nicola Roberts is \\"Chelsea Tanner,\\" who sprays insulting messages with fake bronzer onto her male customers; Nadine Coyle is \\"Frenchie\\", who ineptly tries to give her male customers facials; Sarah Harding is \\"Supa Styler\\", a hair stylist who fails to satisfy any of her customers; Cheryl Cole is \\"Maxi Wax\\", who makes the waxing process as painful as possible; and Kimberley Walsh is \\"The Boss\\", who looks on amusedly as her employees take their revenge on the salon's male customers. Live performances Girls Aloud performed \\"The Show\\" at 2004's Royal Variety Performance. They also performed the song at London gay nightclub G-A-Y, to promote the release of the single, on 26 June 2004. Girls Aloud have included \\"The Show\\" in five of their concert tours. For their first tour, 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour, \\"The Show\\" served as the opening number. For 2006's Chemistry Tour, each member have individual \\"stations\\" modeled after beauty salons, referencing the song's music video. The stations are surrounded by frames, which are illuminated through the song. The group then uses the framework for their dance routine. The following year, on their first greatest hits tour, the band performed the song with a half-naked male dance partner, using a bed for a prop. \\"The Show\\" was also performed on 2009's Out of Control Tour, where the song was included in a greatest hits medley which closed the concerts. In 2013, the song was performed in full during the Ten: The Hits Tour in the style of a Victoria's Secret show .

It runs for 93 km from the Black Forest through the Upper Rhine River Plains. The Kinzig valley and secondary valleys constitute the largest system of valleys in the Black Forest. Depending on the definition, the Kinzig is either the border between the Northern and Middle Black Forest or part of the Middle Black Forest. It is located entirely inside the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and its name is supposed to be of Celtic origin. During the last glacial period the Kinzig and the Murg created a common Kinzig-Murg river system.  Course of the river  The origin of the Kinzig is located on the land of the town of Lo√üburg in the district of Freudenstadt. It runs south, then makes a gradual turn to the west. It leaves the district of Freudenstadt just after it emerges from Alpirsbach, touches the district of Rottweil and continues to spend the largest part of its course in the district of Ortenau. The Kinzig leaves the Black Forest near Offenburg and flows into the Rhine near Kehl. The upper part the Kinzig is a true mountain river that over time has caused quite a few serious floods. Its middle and lower parts have been squeezed into a straight bed lined with tall levees. Renaturation is in progress in the area where the Schutter flows into the Kinzig.  Name  In 1099 the river was first mentioned in Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart as ad Chinzechun, ad aliam Chinzichun, in 1128 the Staatsarchive Sindelfingen referred to the river as Kinzicha. In 1539, 1543, 1560, 1620, 1652 and 1654 it was listed as K√ºnzlin, K√ºntzgen, Kintzg, Kintzgen, Oberkentzgenw√º√ü and K√∂ntzig, respectively. In 1837 it was referred to for the first time as Kinzig. According to Adolf Bach and Bruno Boesch there is some doubt about whether the name Kinzig can really be traced back to the ad Chinczechun, ad aliam Chinzichun of 1099. Bach points to the usage in the northern Breisgau where Kinzigs are described as \\"paths at the bottom of a canyon through the loess\\". In Upper Alsace and Graub√ºnden rivers with the word Kinzig in their name usually describe a canyon. Some argue that the name developed from the Celtic kent meaning various kinds of quick movement or from the Lepontic word Centica (Cinti) which means \\"water\\". With all these possibilities in mind, we can return to Adolf Bach and Bruno Boesch, who think these derivations doubtful. In addition, the question remains of how far the Celts or Pre-Celts had settled the Kinzig area, and which settlers had originally given the river its name. While these questions are difficult to answer for pre-historic times, the fact is that the Kinzig only created a small canyon in its upper part. A completely different river with many twists and turns presents itself as it moves towards the Upper Rhine River Plains. At the end of the last Ice Age it wound its way through the Plains for a long time, on the way absorbing the Murg and only joining the Rhine after it reached the general area of Hockenheim.  Tributaries  In the Black Forest many tributaries empty into the Kinzig, including several longer streams of 20-30 kilometres in length, most coming from the north or south. The following is a list of those over 10 kilometres in length: * Little Kinzig, from the right near the Schenkenzell railway bridge, 20.2 km and 62.9 km¬≤. * Schiltach, from the left in Schiltach, 29.5 km and 115.8 km¬≤. * Wolf, formerly the Wolfach, from the right in Wolfach, 30.8 km and 129.6 km¬≤. * Gutach, from the left near Gutach (Schwarzwaldbahn), 29.3 km and 161.5 km¬≤. * M√ºhlbach or Welschensteinachbach, from the left near Steinach, 10.5 km and 24.9 km¬≤. * Erlenbach, from the right near Biberach, 18.9 km (together with the rather larger Harmersbach, the much longer of its two headstreams, the Harmersbach and the Nordrach) and 102.9 km¬≤. The largest tributary overall reaches the Kinzig a little before its mouth in the Upper Rhine Plain: * Schutter, from the left near Kehl, 56.8 km and 338.2 km¬≤.  Importance as a transport and trade route = Timber rafting  Rafters at the mouth of the Wolfach during the Rafter Festival, summer 2004 in Wolfach In the past, the Kinzig was very important for timber rafting. The earliest mention of this trade on the Kinzig dates to the year 1339. The rafting towns of Wolfach and Schiltach had their own rafting corporations, which organized timber rafting to the Rhine and on to Holland; these corporations were the so-called Schifferschaften (\\"boatmen's associations\\"). They were given the sole rights of timber export by their respective overlords and ran a lucrative business that helped the towns' prosperity. Sebastian M√ºnster writes in his Cosmographia universalis: \\"The people living by the River Kyntzig, especially around Wolfach, earn a living from the great quantity of construction timber, which the float down the waters of the Kyntzig to Strasburg and into the Rhine, and earn a great deal of money every year.\\" Rafting on the Kinzig reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries and then again in the 18th century, when the demand for wood began to rise rapidly, as the Netherlands and England began to build their mighty naval and merchant fleets. The rafters could not match the capabilities of the newly introduced railways, however, and the last commercial timber raft ran down the Kinzig in 1896. Today, timber rafting festivals, museums in Gengenbach, Wolfach and Schiltach, as well as numerous technical facilities, such as weirs recall the timber rafting era.  Historical Roman road  An old travel map of the upper Kinzig valley. C. 1716. The width, length and the favourable east-west direction of the middle and lower valley of the Kinzig make it important for as a communication route. For example, the Romans built a road that passed through the valley: the Kinzig Valley Way (Kinzigtalstrasse) is a Roman road which was built under the Emperor, Vespasian, in 73/74 A.D. from Offenburg through the valley to the simultaneously founded Roman town of Rottweil (Arae Flaviae) and on to Tuttlingen. It was mainly intended to create a shorter strategic link from Mainz to Augsburg, which had for a long time had to take a long detour via the Rhine Knee (Rheinknie) at Basle. During the revolt of the Batavi in 69/70 this detour had proved a problem.  Fauna and flora = Fauna  A regeneration program has been in progress since 2002 to re-introduce salmon into the Kinzig by putting young salmon into the water and removing obstacles. These efforts seem to be successful as in early 2005, for the first time in 50 years, salmon spawn were found in a river in Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Flora  The Kinzig valley is the deepest in the inner Black Forest. In the lower Kinzig valley the villages are below 200 metres above sea level. The climate in the valley is therefore milder than in most other areas of the Black Forest. In the lower valley fruit and wine are produced; Gengenbach, Ortenberg and Ohlsbach are well-known names of wine-growing villages, some of which are on the Baden Wine Road. The countryside around the Kinzig valley in spring blooms far earlier than the surrounding regions of the Black Forest.  Infrastructure  The width, length and favourable east-west direction in the middle and lower valley make the Kinzig Valley important for infrastructure. The Romans maintained a road that traversed the valley. The Kinzigtalstra√üe was a military road built under Emperor Vespasian in 73/74 AD from Offenburg through the Kinzig Valley into the Roman Rottweil (Arae Flaviae) and on to Tuttlingen. The main purpose of the road was to shorten the strategically important connection between Mainz and Augsburg. Until this road was built, the connection took troops via the Rhine bend at Basel and during the revolt of the Batavers in 69/70 AD, this had proved to be a problem. During construction of the road, several Castelles were built. In addition to Rottweil, the rest areas in Offenburg-Rammersweier, Offenburg-Zunsweier, Waldm√∂ssingen, Sulz and Geislingen-H√§senb√ºhl, were augmented by part of the Alb Limes fortifications in Frittlingen, Lautlingen and Burladingen-Hausen. All of them were located in Upper Germanic country except for Burladingen which was in Rhaetian territory. The surprising discovery of the fortification in Frittlingen in 1992 only a few kilometers southeast of Rottweil shows that the Kinzigtalstra√üe was secured and covered with a tight net of military fortifications. The suggestion that the Kinzig Valley itself was home to another fortification has thus gained credibility. Until then, it was supposed that there must have been one or two more yet to be discovered fortifications merely on the basis that the distance between the known ones in Offenburg and Waldm√∂ssingen was very big. Another fortification is assumed in Rottenburg by the end of the 1st century however, it is not clear whether it existed as early as 73/74 AD or not until later in 98 AD. Roughly at the same time that the Kinzigtalstra√üe was built, Roman forts were constructed further north on the right side of the Rhine in places like Frankfurt, Heddernheim, Karben, Gro√ü-Gerau, Gernsheim, Ladenburg (Lopodunum), Heidelberg and Baden-Baden (Aquae). Whether these were advanced posts or the Roman border between 73 and 98 AD, (following a generally defined line east of the Rhine), has yet to be determined. In 98 AD, in the area of present-day southwest Germany, the route between Odenwald and Neckar came under Roman control, making the connection from Mainz to Augsburg shorter yet. As a result, the Kinzigtalstra√üe lost superregional significance. In present-day Germany, the federal highway B 33 runs parallel to the Kinzig from Offenburg until it leaves the Kinzig in the upper valley to follow the Gutach towards Villingen-Schwenningen. From Hausach on towards Freudenstadt, the federal highway B 294, follows the upper Kinzig. For the Black Forest Railway (Schwarzwaldbahn) train service, the valley is also very important. It runs from Offenburg to Hausach where it turns into the Gutach Valley to continue on to Konstanz at Lake Constance. In the upper Kinzig Valley, the Kinzig Valley Railway (Kinzigtalbahn) provides a connection between Hausach and Freudenstadt.

The album has gained a cult following, and is frequently regarded as one of the most influential records of the emo genre. The title of the album was used as the name of the book Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo by Andy Greenwald. Original bass player Scott Beschta is credited with writing and playing all the bass parts for the album. The cover art for the album was shot in front of Trimper's Rides on the boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland. Background and production The Promise Ring released their debut album 30¬∞ Everywhere in September 1996 through independent label Jade Tree. According to vocalist/guitarist Davey von Bohlen, it was recorded in five days \\"in a situation where we had no idea what we wanted to do or how we wanted it to come out.\\" Additionally, Bohlen was ill during the making of it, resulting in issues with his vocals. Despite this, the release was an underground success, earning the group attention from independent publications. The attention was aided by the inclusion of the emo staple \\"A Picture Postcard\\", which had been released earlier on the Falsetto Keeps Time (1996) EP. The band had 500‚Äì600 copies of the album to sell over the course of several gigs, however, during one show at CBGB's, they sold all copies in one go. The band reissued their earlier work as part of The Horse Latitudes compilation in early 1997. In April and May 1997, the group embarked on a European tour; at its conclusion, the band went on a brief break to complete writing for their next album. Guitarist Jason Gnewikow said the group worked on material through jamming. Following this, the group went to Memphis, Tennessee where they began recording at Easley Recording with producer J. Robbins of Jawbox. The album saw the group focus on cleaner production and refined their pop sensibility. Robbins aided the band, helping them work on song writing and improved the overall sound, when compared to 30¬∞ Everywhere. The band toned down the punk rock-esque Midwest emo sound that Bohlen pioneered when he was a member of Cap'n Jazz. Drummer Dan Didier had a strained relationship with bassist Scott Beschta throughout the sessions: \\"I‚Äôm shocked that we just didn't just off one another because it was a bad time.\\" Composition Musically, the sound of Nothing Feels Good has been described as emo and power pop, drawing comparison to Superchunk and Knapsack. Throughout the album, Didier uses various syncopations, triplet fills and double-time cymbal hits. Beschta, instead of playing basic root notes, opted for more melodic and rhythmic parts. Bohlen incorporated geographical and color symbolism in his lyrics; he refers to his girlfriend as red, white and blue in \\"Red & Blue Jeans\\", while in \\"B Is for Bethlehem\\" the colors are representative of blood and flesh. While the record wasn't a concept album, it saw Bohlen reuse a handful of lines, giving it thematic cohesion: the title phrase Nothing Feels Good is mentioned in \\"Red & Blue Jeans\\", while being reused for the title-track, and serving as the basis for \\"How Nothing Feels\\". Similarly two lines, \\"not as good as the interstates are/I just can't take you that far\\", are used in both \\"Make Me a Chevy\\" and \\"A Broken Tenor\\". The opening power pop track \\"Is This Thing On?\\" begins with guitar interplay and aggressive drumming. It consists of five lines of lyrics that Bohlen repeats, and is anchored by Beschta's bass part. It leads into the punk rock-esque \\"Perfect Lines\\", which opens with Gnewikow's distorted guitar part. \\"Why Did Ever We Meet\\" was representative of the 1990s indie rock/emo sound in that it incorporated pop without abandoning the abrasiveness of punk rock. \\"Make Me a Chevy\\" sees Bohlen compare a woman to a car. \\"How Nothing Feels\\" is an acoustic guitar and piano interlude with heavy tape hiss. It is followed by \\"A Broken Tenor\\", which opens with the sound of a house party, and one participant is heard quoting by the poem \\"Daddy\\" Sylvia Plath. The title- track sees Bohlen asking religious and personal questions, and is followed by the pop-orientated track \\"Pink Chimneys\\". An early version of the track had appeared on the (Don't Forget To) Breathe compilation. Release Nothing Feels Good was released on October 14, 1997, through Jade Tree. The album's artwork was shot by Jade Tree co-founder Tim Owen and designed by Gnewikow; it shows a brightly lit photograph of a boardwalk against a white background with colored dots lined up around it. A music video was made for \\"Why Did Ever We Meet\\", directed by Darren Doane, and featured Jade Tree co-founder Darren Walters, Ken Dario, Chris Duncan and Mike Schoenbeck. It appeared on MTV's 120 Minutes, which the members subsequently hosted and were interviewed on by Matt Pinfield. For the album's supporting tour, Beschta was replaced by Tim Burton, who Gnewikow played with in his former band None Left Standing. Didier said him and Beschta began disliking each other, which led to them not caring about each other. The members knew Burton and were aware that he had no plans, asking him to join the group. In February 1998, the band were traveling back home from a show,Salamon 1999, p. 148 while on tour with Hum, in the midst of a snowstorm. Their van flipped over after Bohlen hit a bump on the road; Bohlen flew head-first through the windshield. Bohlen (who had head trauma), Burton (who had broken bones) and Didier, were released from hospital the following morning. Gnewikow, however, was in the intensive care unit for three further weeks due to a broken collarbone and other injuries. Since the group felt Burton wasn't working out, coupled with a broken arm, they replaced him with Scott Schoenbeck. At the time, Schoenbeck had formed Pele with Beschta. The band returned to touring after a six-week break, though with Gnewikow suffering intermittent pain from his collarbone due to his guitar strap. They went on an east coast tour with Jimmy Eat World, and a European stint with Jets to Brazil. The band toured with Jets to Brazil again, touring across the US in October and Japan in November. The album was re-pressed on vinyl alongside 30¬∞ Everywhere and Very Emergency (1999), and received its first cassette edition, in October 2015. A few months later, the band performed the album in its entirety during a one-off reunion show. Reception and legacy Nothing Feels Good received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Blake Butler said the release saw the group move into more poppy territory that they had previously teased on 30¬∞ Everywhere. While Nothing Feels Good continued the \\"beautifully odd\\" lyricism against \\"extremely catchy and powerful music\\", its overall sound conjured up \\"sentimentality and imagination\\" that their \\"music always seems to exude.\\" Ox-Fanzine Joachim Hiller complimented Bohlen's improved vocals, serving as a weakness on their previous record. He called it a \\"seemingly calm\\" album that \\"strings together twelve melancholic-melodic guitar pop pearls.\\" Pitchfork writer Nick Mirov felt that the \\"dearth of lyrics\\" was the release's \\"Achilles' heel\\". He added that Bohlen would repetitively sing \\"the same three lines over and over\\"; it served as a \\"minor blemish on an otherwise damn good album.\\" In a retrospective review, Punknews.org staff member Joe Pelone said the record acted as the best starting point for people wishing to get into the group, calling it \\"catchy, rocking and heartfelt in equal measures.\\" Bohlen's lyrics landed in middle of two ideologies: \\"'90s indie rock bands [that] wrote really good, lo-fi rock songs that weren't actually about anything\\" and emo acts that \\"mean[t] everything.\\" Nothing Feels Good pushed the band to the forefront of the emo music scene,Jacks 1999, p. 68 forging the way for releases such as Something to Write Home About (1999) by the Get Up Kids and Bleed American (2001) by Jimmy Eat World. Bohlen featured on \\"A Priase Chorus\\", a track from Bleed American, where he referenced \\"Why Did Ever We Meet\\". The band became the most successful emo act of the era with sales of Nothing Feels Good reaching the mid-five figures,Greenwald 2003, p. 42 becoming a defining album in the genre's second wave. Mike Damante of the Houston Chronicle said \\"Red & Blue Jeans\\" acted as a blueprint for the likes of Taking Back Sunday and New Found Glory. Similarly, the polaroid-esque aesthetic of the album's cover influenced countless other emo groups. Eduardo Cepeda of Vice said the artwork was \\"one of the quintessential visual cues in the emo canon\\", and also within Jade Tree's roster as Owen and Gnewikow worked on a lot of releases for the label. Nothing Feels Good has appeared on various best-of emo album lists by Drowned in Sound, Kerrang!, LA Weekly, Louder, Rolling Stone, and Treblezine. Similarly, tracks from it have appeared on best-of emo songs lists by NME, Stereogum and Vulture. The album gave its title to the book of the same name by Andy Greenwald.

(2004). It was released by Polydor Records on 13 September 2004, as the second single from the album. The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, and Shawn Lee. The instrumentation was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. \\"Love Machine\\" is an uptempo song with elements of 1980s synthpop. The single was received favourably by contemporary music critics, who deemed it as joyful track that was different from the single releases by other artists at the time. According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006, \\"Love Machine\\" is the second \\"most exhilarating\\" song ever. \\"Love Machine\\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Europe and Ireland. The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling, and portrays the five members in a nightclub/restaurant scene dancing and sipping champagne whilst singing their song. Girls Aloud performed \\"Love Machine\\" on all of their tours and on several live appearances, including at Disney Channel Kids Awards, TMF Awards 2005, and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Background and release Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following the success of their debut album Sound of the Underground. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single \\"The Show\\" was released in June 2004. Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that \\"Love Machine\\" was recorded in 18 parts over three days. Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release \\"Deadlines & Diets\\" instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be \\"career suicide\\" and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top, ITV, 2012 However, despite an \\"embarrassing\\" meeting between the label and the girls, \\"Love Machine\\" was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being released on 13 September 2004. \\"The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio,\\" Higgins said. It was released on three different CD single formats, as well as an additional 7\\" picture disc, making it Girls Aloud's first single available on vinyl. The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of \\"The Show\\". For the sleeve of the second CD, Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines, one for each member, and used \\"Love Machine\\" lyrics as the headlines. The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b-side entitled \\"Androgynous Girls\\", which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album. The Gravitas Disco Mix of \\"Love Machine\\" was also included. The maxi-CD also included a task-based game, created by design agency Holler. The 7\\" picture disc included the radio edit and Tony Lamezma Remix of \\"Love Machine\\". Cheryl Cole later stated that despite her initially hating the song, that the success of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to listen to their label from time to time. Composition \\"Love Machine\\" was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up with some of the song's lyrics by singing \\"nonsense lyrics\\" over a backing track, which eventually evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is written in C major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 88 beats per minute. The vocal range from the band members spans from F3 to B4. An early demo of \\"Love Machine\\" was included on the compilation album Popjustice: 100% Solid Pop Music, and later on an official Girls Aloud singles boxset; this version was sung by band members Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle and Sarah Harding only, and featured radically different lyrics from the released version, even excluding the phrase \\"Love Machine\\". One of the song's lyrics, \\"What will the neighbours say / This time?\\" inspired the album's title, and it is a reference to Girls Aloud's debut single, where Cole sings, \\"Neighbour's banging on the bathroom wall / He's saying 'Crank the bass, I gotta get some more'\\". MusicOMH contributor John Murphy noted the track uses \\"a guitar line that sounds like it's been nicked from an old rockabilly tune\\", and compared its composition to other \\"'80s synth pop songs.\\" Critical reception Girls Aloud performing \\"Love Machine\\" on the Out of Control Tour (2009). The track received generally favourable reviews from music critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian considered \\"The Show\\" and \\"Love Machine\\" as the \\"perfect examples of Xenomania's uniquely rousing approach to pop,\\" adding that the latter \\"sounds, incredibly, like the Smiths' Rusholme Ruffians colliding head-on with that band's musical nemesis, chirpy 1980s synth-pop.\\" A reviewer for Virgin Media stated the song's \\"bouncy drums, perky guitars and ditsy lyrics will probably cause a seizure,\\" and commented further, saying that \\"it sounds so unlike anything else in the charts right now...proving once again that they're still one of the most exciting bands in pop right now.\\" The song was a Track Pick from the Allmusic review of What Will the Neighbours Say? by Sharon Mawer, while Robert Copsey of Digital Spy stated that, despite having many previous releases, it wasn't until \\"Love Machine\\", \\"a swinging, big band track with ludicrous lyrics ‚Äì that they were thrust into the wider public consciousness.\\" A BBC Music critic, however, called it \\"upbeat but not particularly tuneful\\". According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006, \\"Love Machine\\" is the second \\"most exhilarating\\" song ever, after \\"Song 2\\" by Blur. Billboard named the song #65 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. Commercial performance On the week ending 2 October 2004, \\"Love Machine\\" debuted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, being held of the top spot by \\"Call on Me\\" by Eric Prydz. It stayed at the same position the following week, before falling to number 8. The song also reached number six on the UK Downloads Chart, and eventually became the band's 7th best- selling single in the UK. \\"Love Machine\\" also debuted and peaked at number 8 on the European Hot 100 Singles, staying on the top ten for two weeks. In Ireland, the song debuted at number nine on 16 September 2004, and remained at the same position for three weeks, becoming Girls Aloud's first single to fail to enter the top five. It spent one last week in the top ten at number ten. \\"Love Machine\\" also entered the Dutch chart Single Top 100 on 14 May 2005 at number 52, before falling of the chart after 4 weeks. Music video The accompanying music video for \\"Love Machine\\" was directed by Stuart Gosling for Image Dynamic Pictures, and filmed at the Titanic restaurant on London's Brewer Street. Gosling shot the project on 35mm film to give it the desired sleek, stylised, polished and glossy look. Girls Aloud members stopped in at Camden Post to view the footage and were impressed with the final results of it. The video depicts a nightclub/restaurant scene with the five women dancing and sipping champagne at the location whilst singing their pop number. A caption at the start of the video identifies the location as \\"The Eskimo Club\\", which explains the otherwise meaningless song lyrics \\"Let's go eskimo\\". Live performances \\"Love Machine\\" was promoted through several live performances, including at the Disney Channel Kids Awards on 16 September 2004, and at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party in 2004. They also performed it at the Carling Academy London on 10 February 2005, and at the TMF Awards 2005 in Belgium. The same year, Girls Aloud went on their debut tour, the What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour, where they performed \\"Love Machine\\" in schoolgirl uniforms. For 2006's Chemistry Tour, there was an interlude where the group danced to \\"1 Thing\\" by Amerie. There was a similar interlude during 2007's The Greatest Hits Tour, where a big band breakdown was included. Also in 2007, the song was performed at the T4 on the Beach special. \\"Love Machine\\" was performed on 2008's Tangled Up Tour, where the band members wore cabaret inspired costumes. Later that year, the band performed it at The Girls Aloud Party TV special held by ITV1, and at the V Festival. For 2009's Out of Control Tour, the song was given a brassier, retro arrangement and included a dance break. On 14 December 2012, the band appeared on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, performing the song to promote their greatest hits album Ten, and also at The Graham Norton Show the same day. To further promote the greatest hits, \\"Love Machine\\" was also included on a promotional megamix. In 2013, the song was performed during the Ten: The Hits Tour. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.

The cave is located near the lake R√•ggej√°vrre, about south of the village of Musken. R√•ggej√°vrrer√°jgge is a limestone cave that has been eroded by this underground river. At deep, it is the deepest cave in Scandinavia and the only known deep cave north of the Arctic Circle. Regional Setting Generally, the area is a vast plateau (exceeding an elevation of above sea level) that is incised by the steep-walled Tysfjorden. Within the impermeable rock, there are three two-dimensional stripes of marble that run from the top of the plateau to below sea level (the fjord is deep), and continue on the other side. Raggejavreraige is located on the south side of the fjord within the westernmost stripe. In places, the cave occupies the entire width of the marble, which does not exceed . Road access to the cave is limited. The nearest road ends at the village of Drag (via Bod√∏), about to the north. From Drag, there is scheduled boat service that can be taken to the small village of Musken. Accommodations at the local school and arrangements for trailhead drop-off and pickup by motor-boat can be arranged from Musken. After a stiff hike on a good trail up to an elevation of the upper entrance area is reached. Cave Description Surface water atop the plateau sinks where it encounters the marble, but the accessible entrance to Raggejavreraige (\\"RJR\\") is some away, a short distance above the shallow valley floor. This entrance is not particularly distinctive, but its strong, inward gust of wind erases any doubt that it is a large cave. The cave consists of about of passages that alternate between steep rifts or shafts and horizontal or low-slope passages. RJR's dominant feature is the Storstupet (\\"Big Shaft\\"). All of the water falls down a parallel shaft only a few metres away. The Ulvgangen (\\"Wolf Walk\\") traverses across the cascades at the mouth of this wet shaft to the dry Storstupet. A pulldown descent of Storstupet is complicated by its low angle (about 80 degrees), and many teams prefer to detackle this pitch from above. Halfway down Storstupet is a window connecting back with the wet shaft, so descending cavers can enjoy all of the sound and fury of the wet shaft in relative comfort. All of the water from the parallel shaft sinks into the floor at its bottom, and is not seen again in the cave. RJR's other major shaft is the impressive Litlestupet (Little Shaft), reduced to by a partial bypass known as Knivgangen (\\"Razor Passage\\"). Unlike Storstupet, Litlestupet is dry, quiet, and free-hanging. As there are three entrances, cavers conducting a through- trip from the upper entrance at above sea level can exit at the Mistral exit at above sea level or at the lowest exit which is in a cliff a mere above the fjord. Exploration Norwegian geologist Steinar Foslie visited the RJR area in the late 1930s, and noted the presence of sinking streams resurging at sea level. In 1968, British caver David Heap of the Kendal Cave Club and Ulv Holbye (after whom Ulvgangen is named) led a school party to about partway down Storstupet, which was descended the next year by a KCC party using a winch, completing exploration of most of the cave and exiting via the middle entrance. The connection between the two lower entrances was made by a British team in 1979. Doubts about the accuracy of the cave survey (stated depth was anywhere between ) led to a resurvey of most of the cave by Stein-Eric Lauritzen and others in 1991, which corrected the depth of the cave to . The entrances to the cave are located at elevations of , , and above sea level, with the low point of the cave at above sea level. The cave is known to resurge below sea level.

Since kings cannot move immediately adjacent to each other (see Rules of chess), neither king can advance, creating a mutual blockade. In this situation, the player not having to move is said to \\"have the opposition\\" . It is a special type of zugzwang and most often occurs in endgames with only kings and pawns . The side with the move may have to move their king away, potentially allowing the opposing king access to important squares. Taking the opposition is a means to an end (normally forcing the opponent's king to move to a weaker position) and is not always the best thing to do. There are extensions of direct opposition, such as diagonal opposition and distant opposition, which can be conducive to reaching direct opposition. All three types may be referred to simply as opposition if the type is unambiguous in context. Direct opposition Direct opposition is a position in which the kings are on the same rank or file and they are separated by one square. When the term opposition is used, it normally refers to direct opposition. In this diagram, the player whose turn it is not to move has the opposition. If it is Black's turn to move, White has the opposition and wins . (See King and pawn versus king endgame.) If it were White's turn to move, Black would have the opposition and the position would be a draw. In order to ensure correct play in situations like in the diagram, it may be helpful to remember that each time the pawn steps forward, it must be without giving check. If the pawn checks the opponent's king, the opposition will be lost and the game drawn. Example In the game Svetozar Gligoriƒá‚ÄìBobby Fischer, 1959, Black can draw by keeping the white king from getting to any of the key squares (marked by dots). This is accomplished by not allowing White to get the opposition, and seizing the opposition if the white king advances. : 57... Kb8! This is the only move to draw. (In the actual game the players agreed to a draw at this point.) Other moves allow White to get the opposition and then get to a key square. If the white king gets to a key square, White wins. For example 1...Kb7? 2.Kb5, then the black king moves and the white king gets to a key square and then wins by forcing promotion of the pawn. : 58. Kc5 Kc7 : 59. Kb5 Kb7 : 60. Ka5 Ka7 and Black draws. In this sequence, any other moves by Black lose , . Diagonal opposition {align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } Opposition along a is called diagonal opposition. Sometimes diagonal opposition is used to achieve direct opposition. An example is the position in the first diagram, with Black to move. White has the direct opposition in this position, but it does him no good because his king cannot attack the black pawn after the black king moves away. White needs to achieve direct opposition closer to the pawn. :1... Kf8 2. Kd6 and White has the diagonal opposition (second diagram). :2... Ke8 3. Ke6 White now has direct opposition on a useful square, and White wins: : 3... Kf8 4. Kd7 Kg8 5. Ke7 Kh8 6. f6 gxf6 7. Kf7 7.Kxf6 also wins for White . Distant opposition Distant opposition is a position in which the kings are on the same rank or file but are separated by more than one square. If there are an odd number of squares between the kings, the player not having the move has the (distant) opposition. As with diagonal opposition, it is often converted to direct opposition, as in the diagram : :1. Ke2 White takes the distant opposition. :1... Ke7 2. Ke3 Ke6 3. Ke4 Taking the direct opposition; and now Black must step aside. :3... Kd6 If 3...Kf6 then White plays the corresponding 4.Kf4! :4. Kd4 4.Kf5 would lead to both pawns queening. :4... Kc6 4...Ke6 5.Kc5 and White is way ahead in the queening race. :5. Ke5 and White has a choice of which pawn he wins, using the created passed pawn as an outside passed pawn unless he can promote it directly. Black can be tricky and try: :1... Kf8 The point is if 2.Ke3 then 2...Ke7 and now Black has the distant opposition and draws. Similarly, if 2.Kf3 then 2...Kf7. White must remember that the aim of the opposition is to penetrate, so to step sideways and forward with ... :2. Kd3 Ke7 Otherwise White will be able to penetrate with Kc5, and will win the race to queen. :3. Ke3! White again has the distant opposition, transposing into the main line. Teaching tool This position is very similar to the previous position. White is to checkmate, moving the rook only once in the process. The main line is: :1. Kg2 Taking the distant opposition. :1... Kg7 2. Kg3 Kg6 3. Kg4 Kh6 Since the black king has been forced to step aside to the h-file, White can now penetrate on the f-file. :4. Kf5 Kg7 If 4...Kh5 then 5.Rh1. :5. Kg5 Kh7 6. Kf6 Kg8 If 6...Kh8 then 7.Kf7 Kh7 8.Rh1#. :7. Kg6 Kh8 8. Rf8# Again, Black can be tricky and try: :1... Kh8 2. Kf3! Again, White penetrates. If 2.Kg3 then 2...Kg7 3.Kh3 Kh7 gives Black the distant opposition. :2... Kg7 If 2...Kh7 then 3.Kf4! :3. Kg3 etc. Purpose Yuri Averbakh pointed out that the opposition is a means to an end; the end is penetration to a . This can be a square in front of a pawn, so the king can lead it to the queening square, or into a critical zone to win an enemy blocked pawn. In the diagram, White should play :1. Kc5 Taking the opposition by 1.Ke4 merely draws. This second position shows a simpler example. If White takes the opposition with 1.Ke6 he makes no progress. The winning move is :1.

Julius Erasmus HilgardJulius Erasmus Hilgard 1825-1890 A History of the First Half-century of the National Academy of Sciences, 1863-1913 was born at Zweibr√ºcken, Rhineland-Palatinate, January 7, 1825. His father, Theodore Erasmus Hilgard, was for many years Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals, but on account of his liberal opinions was so dissatisfied with conditions in his native country that in 1835 he emigrated to America. The journey from his native place to Havre was made in wagons. After a voyage of 62 days, the family landed at New Orleans at Christmas, and journeyed up the Mississippi to St. Louis, and thence to a farm at Belleville, Illinois. As the oldest son, Julius gave valuable help by his practical talents. His education was carried on at home. Music, chemistry, ancient and modern languages and mathematics (the higher branches of the latter being studied without outside help), occupied his attention until 1843, when he went to Philadelphia to study engineering and to obtain employment. In that city he made the acquaintance of Professor Bache, and commenced a lifelong friendship with Elisha Kent Kane, the arctic explorer. The first work obtained was in the preliminary surveys of the Bear Mountain Railroad. Soon, however, Professor Bache, recognizing his abilities, procured young Hilgard a position in the Coast Survey, in which service he continued, with short interruptions, until his death. In the field work, in computations and investigations in the office, in the publication of the records and results of the Survey, in his influence on political leaders, Mr. Hilgard rendered highly intelligent and valuable aid to the service. Throughout the American Civil War he served the Union army and navy by the construction of maps and charts and by surveys as well as by tidal and other information. During the failing health of Professor Bache, Hilgard, who was at that time in charge of the Coast Survey office, was obliged to perform the duties of Superintendent, which he did without extra compensation until the appointment of Benjamin Peirce to the position. Though it seems fitting that Hilgard should have become Superintendent upon the death of Bache, he did not receive the appointment until 1881. At that time his health was so impaired that, as he said, \\" it came too late.\\" He was soon forced to resign. While Assistant Superintendent, his work in the Office of Weights and Measures gained him most favorable notice in Europe and he was invited to the directorship of an International Bureau of Weights and Measures about to be established in Paris. Declining this, but continuing his connection with the International Committee, a beautiful S√®vres vase was presented to him by President Theirs on behalf of the French Government in recognition of his services. He also had great satisfaction in being instrumental in bringing to a successful ending the operations for the telegraphic determination of transatlantic longitudes. In 1872 he was one of the members of the International Metric Commission at Paris and was made a member of the permanent committee. In 1875, he was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among his other valuable services, Hilgard delivered in 1876 a course of twenty lectures at Johns Hopkins University on the subject of \\"Extended Territorial Surveying.\\" Resigning his position in July, 1885, he lived in retirement for five years, and died at Washington, May 9, 1890.

Memoir of Julins Erasmus Hilgard.Memoir of Julins Erasmus Hilgard. 1825-1890 By E.W. Hilgard, in Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 3, 1895, PP- 327-338. Julins Erasmus Hilgard was born on January 7, 1825, at Zweibr√ºcken, Rhenish Bavaria, where his father, Theodore Erasmus, held for a number of years the position of chief justice of the court of appeals (supreme court) of that province of Bavaria. Born in the initial year of the French revolution and educated under the influence of that remarkable period, the father was a prominent Liberal in the most liberal province of Germany, and, chafing under the reactionary tendencies and measures that had become especially rampant after the futile attempt to overthrow them, made by some of the hot-headed youth at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1833, he conceived the purpose of transplanting his large family to the United States, where he hoped to find the \\"ideal republic\\" realized. Despite brilliant offers of advancement from the government, he carried out this purpose in the 'autumn of 1835, accompanied by numerous testimonials of regret and esteem from his constituents, and carrying a letter from General Lafayette commending him to the good offices of the American people. At that time the subject of this sketch had nearly completed his tenth year and had gone through the third grade of the gymnasium with so much credit that at the closing of the school course preceding his departure he carried off all the prizes ‚Äî three in number ‚Äî which were bestowed upon him by the noted educator, Thiersch, according to custom, amid sound of trumpets. On the voyage from his home at Zweibriicken to the port of Havre, which was made by the only mode of conveyance then known; viz., by wagons, Julins, as the oldest brother among nine children, was first called upon to exercise those practical qualities that served him so well in after life. Landing at New Orleans on Christmas Day, after a long passage of 62 days, the family proceeded up the Mississippi, which was running with heavy ice, to St. Louis, and thence to Belleville, Illinois, where the father purchased a farm already well developed, which remained the family residence for many years. Schools at that time were few and primitive in that region; hence Julins, together with his brothers and sisters, received instruction from the father, the older ones also teaching the younger; all, however, with many interruptions from participation in the work of farm and household, inevitable in pioneer life. Of this Julins naturally had his full share, but he varied the routine by devoting himself successively to the study of music, of chemistry and other branches of natural science, while pursuing with his father, by preference, that of ancient and modern languages and mathematics. In the latter he soon outstripped his teacher, and thereafter continued it into the higher branches without outside help, until, in 1843, at the age of 18 years, he went to Philadelphia (where a married sister, Mrs. Sharon Tyndale,Sharon Tyndale was later on secretary of the State of Illinois. then resided) with a view to the study of engineering and practical employment. At Philadelphia he soon formed the acquaintance of several prominent families, among them those of Judges Patterson and Kane. At the house of the latter he was first introduced to Professor Bache, who had not long before succeeded Hassler in the superinteudency of the United States Coast Survey and was a friend of Hilgard's maternal uncle, August Ritter von Pauli, of Munich, a distinguished engineer. Another outcome of this connection was a lifelong friendship with Elisha Kent Kane, one of the sons of the family, whose subsequent explorations in the Arctic regions enlisted his hearty sympathy and support. His first practical employment was in the preliminary surveys of the Bear Mountain railroad, then a new enterprise, hut his mental activity in a higher sphere soon manifested itself in a communication to Mr. Bache, made in January, 1844, in which he called attention to errors in the formulas used in the Coast Survey in the computation of geographical positions, and gave his own development of correct formulas. In reply Mr. Bache wrote to the young man of nineteen: \\"You have overridden two of our most experienced computers and have shown that they are seriously in error.\\" The incident was soon followed up by Bache with an offer of subordinate position in the Coast Survey, in accepting which young Hilgard remarked that he would rather \\"do high work at low pay than low work at high pay.\\" He entered at once upon the work assigned him in the computing division, but his official appointment bears the date of December 28, 1846. In the year 1845-'46, however, we already find him engaged in the secondary triangulation of the Chesapeake, below Kent island, the illness of the chief of the party, Captain (since General, C. S. A.) Joseph E. Johnston, left Hilgard in charge of the work. Concerning this first trial of his strength the superintendent's report of that year says: > The measurement of the angles was made by Mr. J. E. Hilgard, whose zeal and > the ability with which he has discharged these duties deserve notice here, > as they have received it in the reports of the chief of his party. Among the field-work of the following year was the measurement of the Dauphin island base, made by Superintendent Bache, assisted by Hilgard. The latter then executed the secondary triangulation from Dauphin island to Vermillion bay, amid great difficulties arising from want of suitable means of transportation, and continuing the work late in the season \\"under conditions of considerable hardship that might have excused him from keeping the field.\\" The succeeding year (1847-' 48) he extended the secondary triangulation of Mississippi sound westward to Lake Borgne, and made observations for latitude and longitude at Dollar point, Galveston bay, including chronometer difference with Pascagoula station. In conjunction with Messrs. Fauntleroy and Davidson, he commenced the measurement of base and main triangulation of Galveston bay. During all this time, when not in the field he was engaged in computations and investigations at the office, largely under the immediate direction of the superintendent. In August, 1848, he was married at Washington to Miss Katherine Clements, of that city. During 1848- '49 he was chiefly occupied in astronomical, magnetic and latitude observations on the Florida Keys, as well as measurements of a preliminary base and triangulation near Key West and Bahia Monda, and from Key Biscayne towards Carysfoot reef. Again his work was carried on far into the winter season under adverse conditions, and in December and January, 1849-'50, we find him engaged in geodetic and magnetic observations at and off Cape Florida. After some summer field-work on the coast of New England, he returned in September to take charge of the computing department of the Coast Survey office, in which he continued through the years 1851-'52-'53. The efficient condition of that department during that time is specially referred to by the assistants in charge of the office, Captain Benham and Major Stevens, the latter saving: > It affords me unusual gratification to acknowledge the services of Mr. > Hilgard, in charge of the computing department, and to commend the zeal, > promptitude, and accuracy of every member of that department. After 1853, while still continuing to have the supervision of the computing department, he was frequently detailed for work of special importance or difficulty, such as the measurement of bases, the testing and discussion of the errors of instruments, etc. On March 31, 1854, while engaged in work on the Dauphin island base, the schooner Phoenix, with the entire party on board, was capsized in a squall and sunk to the topmast, on which the party took refuge, afterward escaping in a boat at considerable peril of their lives. Among his work of this year was the perfecting of a reflecting signal vane revolved by the wind, very simple and effective, and extensively used since. In 1855, while still continuing occasional field-work, he was put in charge of the publication of the records and results of the Coast Survey, in order to insure a steady progress in publication. This, together with miscellaneous field and scientific work, including a series of very elaborate experiments on the comparison of the standard bar of the base apparatus with the standard meter, occupied his time very closely up to the middle of the year 1860, when the necessary attention to his material interests led him to dissolve his official connection with the Coast Survey for a time, in order to engage in a prominent business enterprise at Paterson, New Jersey. He found himself, however, unable to relinquish his interest in the affairs of his \\" first love,\\" the Coast Survey, and when, at the outbreak of the civil war, Superintendent Bache appealed to him to return and lend his aid in supporting the Survey, when its very existence was threatened as a measure of ill- understood economy, he promptly dissolved his lucrative business connection and repaired to Washington, where he brought strong arguments to bear upon Schuyler Colfax and Roscoe Conkling (eminent as leaders in the dominant party), showing how important such an organization as the Coast Survey must be to the country in time of war. At first, Conkling's close and critical examination of his argument led Hilgard to believe him actuated by a spirit hostile to the Survey; but he was greatly relieved to find, soon afterward, that he had converted both men into earnest and active supporters of the work. Subsequently he took an active part in organizing the National Academy of Sciences, of which he became a charter member; he also contributed largely to the investigations made by that body for the Government. In 1862 he assumed charge of the Coast Survey office, a position which during the war involved heavy responsibilities, which were soon aggravated by the beginning of the mental disease that incapacitated Mr. Bache for performance of the duties of Superintendent, and terminated in his death. Gradually Hilgard found himself forced to assume, one after another, the duties of Superintendent, until in the autumn of 1864 the whole devolved upon him, in addition to his duties as assistant in charge of the office. In this onerous and responsible position he remained, under heavy strain, until, in February, 1867, the appointment of Benjamin Peirce as Superintendent terminated the interregnum. All these extra services were rendered by him without compensation. Of the political causes which brought about Hilgard's being passed over in the appointment of a successor to Bache it would be profitless to speak here. As the one who had carried the burden of the work during the most critical period, and had not only brought it through safely, but with increased reputation and appreciation for efficiency and usefulness, his claims were too obvious to be overlooked or fairly contested. As to his action under the slight, it is pertinent to introduce the following testimony of Superintendent Peirce, a competent witness, who cannot be suspected of partiality: > During the illness of my lamented predecessor the administration of the > Survey fell upon the shoulders of the assistant in charge, Mr. J. E. > Hilgard. The distinguished ability with which this difficult service was > discharged was manifest to all. He has extended to me the benefit of this > experience liberally and loyally. While I willingly acknowledge myself under > deep and lasting obligations to him for the aid thus rendered me, I can also > testify that in all respects he has been equally true to my predecessor, the > greatness of whose reputation has not been diminished in his keeping. That, with such a record and with such testimony in his favor, his claims should have been passed over a second time in the appointment of the successor of Peirce, on the resignation of the latter, was not unexpected, in view of the continuation in power of the same dominant influences; that the event should have passed without exciting some painful reflections with him and others cognizant of the facts would have been unnatural. It was partly, doubtless, under the influence of a feeling that reparation was due that Hilgard was elected to the presidency of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the year 1875. He, however, continued in charge of the Coast Survey office and in the performance of a great variety of scientific work until his appointment to the superintendency in 1881. The duty of conducting the work of the office of Weights and Measures also devolved upon him as assistant superintendent during that time, and he was essentially active in shaping the legislation concerning the legalization of the metric system in the United States. The metric standards for the States were prepared under his supervision. In April, 1872, he departed for Europe in charge of operations for the telegraphic determination of transatlantic longitude, specially between the observatories of Greenwich and Paris on the one hand, and those of Harvard and Washington on the other. The successful accomplishment of this long-pending task by himself as an American was a source of much gratification to him. He returned to his duties at the Coast Survey office in November, 1872, and in the course of that year made a special determination of the length of the standard bar used in the measurement of the primary base line near Atlanta, Ga. The following year he continued the same duties until September, 1874, when he departed for Europe a second time, under an appointment as a delegate to represent the Government at the International Conference for the construction of a new standard meter, which had been called at Paris. The report of the Superintendent says on this subject: > To the watchful care of Professor Hilgard for the interest of the public > service and his intimate relations with leading scientific men at home and > abroad is mainly due the present standing of the office. As a member of the > International Committee on Weights and Measures, to which body he has been > accredited by the President of the United States, Mr. Hilgard, as vice- > president of the commission, will take passage for Europe before the close > of the present month to attend a meeting of the body at Paris. He participated actively in its deliberations with such ability that when it had been determined to establish an International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Paris, the directorship of the new institution was offered to him, but was declined, to the surprise and regret of many of his friends who were familiar with the aspect of affairs at Washington, and who would have desired for him the otium cum dignitate of such a position. In a subsequent report, the Superintendent of the Coast Survey says, regarding this offer: > The invitation tendered to Assistant Hilgard to accept the directorship of > the bureau marks the sense held in that eminently scientific body of this > special fitness for organizing and conducting an institution so exacting in > its scientific demands and so novel in political inception. While declining > the proffered honor, he will nevertheless continue his cooperation as a > member of the International Committee on Weights and Measures. Subsequently a beautiful S√®vres china vase was presented to him on behalf of the French Government by President Theirs, in recognition of his services in connection with the International Commission, a similar one being presented to Professor Joseph Henry. In the report of 1874- '75, the Superintendent remarks in respect to Hilgard's relations to the Survey: \\"To his long experience, eminent ability, and thorough comprehension of the requirements of the work, is due the effective cooperation of the office work with that in the field.\\" In the report of the following year we find a paper from his pen, on a chart of the magnetic declination of the United States. In 1875, he wrote a paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science \\"On the Measurement of a Base Line for the Primary Triangulation of the United States Coast Survey near Atlanta, Georgia;\\" another for the Philosophical Society of Washington on \\"The Relation of the Legal Standards of Measure of the United States to those of Great Britain and France.\\" In August, 1876, he also delivered an address as retiring president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. During the following year, while continuing in charge of the office, he was appointed Inspector of Standard Weights and Measures, sets of which had been ordered to be distributed to the several states. He also made a comparison of the American and English standard yards, a matter of great importance and interest. He likewise described an optical densimeter for sea water,For this instrument a gold medal was subsequently awarded to him at the London International Fisheries Exposition, 1883. and made important instrumental comparisons. The report of the Superintendent for 1876-77 says: > In the summer of 1876, but without remitting in executive duties pertaining > to the Coast Survey office, Mr. Hilgard acted as one of the judges on > scientific and mechanical apparatus at the Centennial Exposition at > Philadelphia. His intimate knowledge respecting instruments of precision > associated him, as a leading member of the board of judges, with some of the > ablest scientists of America and Europe. > > Subsequently, on invitation, he delivered a course of 20 lectures for the > Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore, on the subject of 'Extended > Territorial Surveying,' thus contributing the benefit of his long experience > to the training of young men for a branch of work which is one of the great > needs of the country ‚Äî an accurate mapping of its entire surface. In June, 1878, he was detailed from his office- work for important duties requiring the presence of a representative of the Coast Survey in Europe. He assisted in organizing an International Committee on Weights and Measures; made at London a comparison of the Coast Survey standard yard with the British Imperial standard, and also attended the annual session of the International Geodetic Association at Hamburg. On his return from Europe, in November, 1878, he resumed charge of the office, directing many scientific investigations and, among others, selecting points for magnetic observations in the United States from and in addition to those at which observations had for a number of years been made at the charge of the \\"Bache fund\\" under his direction. He made records and reports of these observations to the National Academy of Sciences in 1881. In December of that year, on the death of Superintendent Patterson, he was himself appointed to the office and continued in the same until, in July, 1885, he was obliged to resign. Among the special work done by him during that period was the construction of a relief model of the basin of the Gulf of Mexico (for which he suggested the name of the \\"Bay of North America\\"), and the publication of a memoir on the same, published in the American Journal of Science. It is certain that at the time of his appointment to the super-intendancy his physical and mental strength had already become seriously impaired by the inroads of the insidious disease (Bright's) which ultimately, after several years of often intense suffering, ended in his death. That to some extent he was conscious of his enfeebled condition is evidenced by his remark when receiving the notice of his appointment, that \\"it came too late.\\" Years before his life had been saddened by the loss of three young children; it was now darkened by the death of the last remaining son, Frederic, who, though always delicate, had lived to manhood and appeared to be entering upon a successful career as civil engineer. This blow, coming at a time when even in his letters he complained of increasing inability to do the accustomed amount of work, gave a grave downward impulse to his already failing strength. That he did not at that time find any one to lean upon as Bache had leaned upon him under similar circumstances was a misfortune which allowed matters to progress until a political change found in his case a welcome opportunity for the exhibition of the reformer's zeal. In respect to his physical and consequent mental condition at the time when he appeared before the Presidential commission on the conduct of the Coast Survey, it may suffice to say that the physician who examined him immediately after his resignation declared that had he been aware of the facts he \\"would, unsolicited and from a sense of justice, have gone before that body and testified that Hilgard could not be held responsible for his acts.\\" This statement, amply corroborated by the severe illness immediately following, should dispose of the unjust censure visited upon him at the time, whether by those ignorant or by others forgetful of the devotion, singleness of purpose, and high ability which had uniformly marked his previous career. While there could be no question of the necessity for a change, the difficulty long experienced by the administration in finding a successor among his peers in science stands in evidence of the feeling excited in them by the harshness of the treatment bestowed upon him. In his personal and social relations, Hilgard was early noted for his geniality, an intense appreciation of the beautiful in art and literature, and a thorough enjoyment of the humorous, however grave might be the situation that gave rise to it. He remained through life very fond of the ancient classics. A small pocket edition volume of Horace's odes long accompanied him on his travels, and he was fond of quoting for his own and others' benefit on critical occasions the \\"√Üquam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem,\\" a principle he honored by close observance so long as he remained of sound mind. Perhaps none of his personal traits was more pronounced than his generosity toward those in need, whether of substantial aid (which was frequently given beyond his financial ability) or of advice and moral support. To deserving young men especially he liked to extend a helping hand, and tired not of doing so, even though too often illy rewarded for his efforts. He often said that the older men ought to see to it that the right kind of successors were ready to fill their places when they left the stage. The loyal friendship he bore toward others he trusted would be reciprocally extended, and he seemingly preferred the disappointment thus frequently incurred to a relinquishment of his faith in human nature at large. That the life of a mind so constituted should be largely checkered with disappointment was inevitable; but to such lives the unswervingly faithful performance of duty, the singleness of high purpose, and the accomplishment of the same, so far as circumstances permit, carry their own reward. He died at his residence in Washington, after a lingering and painful illness, on May 9, 1890. Projects One of the projects on which J.E.

Hilgard. In 1859, the self-recording magnetometer at the Smithsonian Institution may have been only the second such device in operation, the original one being under the management of Balfour Stewart at the Kew Observatory in London. Unlike the instruments at the Kew Observatory, it is unlikely that the instruments at the Smithsonian were in continuous operation during any part of 1859.

It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one. Typically the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass will measure the same duration regardless of orientation. The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter, the bulb size and the neck width. Depictions of an hourglass as a symbol of the passage of time are found in art, especially on tombstones or other monuments, from antiquity to the present day. The form of a winged hourglass has been used as a literal depiction of the well-known Latin epitaph tempus fugit (\\"time flies\\"). History= Antiquity  Sarcophagus dated c. 350, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the object held by Morpheus in his hands) The origin of the hourglass is unclear. Its predecessor the clepsydra, or water clock, is known to have existed in Babylon and Egypt as early as the 16th century BCE.  Early Middle Ages  Temperance bearing an hourglass; detail Lorenzetti's Allegory of Good Government, 1338 There are no records of the hourglass existing in Europe prior to the Early Middle Ages; the first documented example dates from the 8th century CE, crafted by a Frankish monk named Liutprand who served at the cathedral in Chartres, France. But it was not until the 14th century that the hourglass was seen commonly, the earliest firm evidence being a depiction in the 1338 fresco Allegory of Good Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century. The written records about it were mostly from logbooks of European ships. In the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores. The earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c. 1345, in a receipt of Thomas de Stetesham, clerk of the King's ship La George, in the reign of Edward III of England; translated from the Latin, the receipt says: in 1345: > \\"The same Thomas accounts to have paid at Lescluse, in Flanders, for twelve > glass horologes (\\" pro xii. orlogiis vitreis \\"), price of each 4¬Ω gross', in > sterling 9s. Item, For four horologes of the same sort (\\" de eadem secta \\"), > bought there, price of each five gross', making in sterling 3s. 4d.\\" Marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea. Unlike the clepsydra, the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass. The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.Balmer, R.T. \\"The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development.\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. \\"The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development.\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632. Seamen found that the hourglass was able to help them determine longitude, distance east or west from a certain point, with reasonable accuracy. The hourglass also found popularity on land. As the use of mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services became more common, creating a \\"need to keep track of time\\", the demand for time- measuring devices increased. Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments became more common, their uses became more practical. Hourglasses were commonly seen in use in churches, homes, and work places to measure sermons, cooking time, and time spent on breaks from labor. Because they were being used for more everyday tasks, the model of the hourglass began to shrink. The smaller models were more practical and very popular as they made timing more discreet. After 1500, the hourglass was not as widespread as it had been. This was due to the development of the mechanical clock, which became more accurate, smaller and cheaper, and made keeping time easier. The hourglass, however, did not disappear entirely. Although they became relatively less useful as clock technology advanced, hourglasses remained desirable in their design. The oldest known surviving hourglass resides in the British Museum in London. Not until the 18th century did John Harrison come up with a marine chronometer that significantly improved on the stability of the hourglass at sea. Taking elements from the design logic behind the hourglass, he made a marine chronometer in 1761 that was able to accurately measure the journey from England to Jamaica accurate within five seconds. 19th century hourglass Design Little written evidence exists to explain why its external form is the shape that it is. The glass bulbs used, however, have changed in style and design over time. While the main designs have always been ampoule in shape, the bulbs were not always connected. The first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a cord wrapped at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between.http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Hourglass.html It was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow. Material While some early hourglasses actually did use sand as the granular mixture to measure time, many did not use sand at all. The material used in most bulbs was a combination of \\"powdered marble, tin/lead oxides, and pulverized, burnt eggshell\\". Over time, different textures of granule matter were tested to see which gave the most constant flow within the bulbs. It was later discovered that for the perfect flow to be achieved the ratio of granule bead to the width of the bulb neck needed to be 1/12 or more but not greater than 1/2 the neck of the bulb.Peterson, Ivars. \\"Trickling sand: how an hourglass ticks\\". Science News, Vol. 144, No. 11 (September 11, 1993). p. 167 Practical uses 3-minute egg timer Hourglasses were an early dependable and accurate measure of time. The rate of flow of the sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument will not freeze in cold weather. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were being used in a range of applications at sea, in the church, in industry, and in cookery. During the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan around the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip had been authorized by King Charles I of Spain. It was the job of a ship's page to turn the hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship's log. Noon was the reference time for navigation, which did not depend on the glass, as the sun would be at its zenith. A number of sandglasses could be fixed in a common frame, each with a different operating time, e.g. as in a four-way Italian sandglass likely from the 17th century, in the collections of the Science Museum, in South Kensington, London, which could measure intervals of quarter, half, three- quarters, and one hour (and which were also used in churches, for priests and ministers to measure lengths of sermons). Modern practical uses The Timewheel in Budapest, Hungary. While they are no longer widely used for keeping time, some institutions do maintain them. Both houses of the Australian Parliament use three hourglasses to time certain procedures, such as divisions. The sandglass is still widely used as the kitchen egg timer; for cooking eggs, a three-minute timer is typical, hence the name \\"egg timer\\" for three-minute hourglasses. Egg timers are sold widely as souvenirs. Sand timers are also sometimes used in games such as Pictionary and Boggle to implement a time constraint on rounds of play. Symbolic uses Pirate Christopher Moody's \\"Bloody Red\\" jack, c. 1714 Unlike most other methods of measuring time, the hourglass concretely represents the present as being between the past and the future, and this has made it an enduring symbol of time itself. The hourglass, sometimes with the addition of metaphorical wings, is often depicted as a symbol that human existence is fleeting, and that the \\"sands of time\\" will run out for every human life. \\"Time is getting short; there will be little opportunity to do what you have to do unless you take the chance now. The phrase is often used with reference to one who has not much longer to live. The allusion is to the hourglass.\\" It was used thus on pirate flags, to strike fear into the hearts of the pirates' victims. In England, hourglasses were sometimes placed in coffins, \\"Hour-glasses were formerly placed in coffins and buried with the corpse, probably as symbols of mortality‚Äîthe sands of life having run out. See Gent. Mag. vol xvi, 646, and xvii, 264.\\" and they have graced gravestones for centuries. The hourglass was also used in alchemy as a symbol for hour. The former Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich in London used an hourglass on its coat of arms, symbolising Greenwich's role as the origin of GMT. The district's successor, the Royal Borough of Greenwich, uses two hourglasses on its coat of arms. Modern symbolic uses Hourglass cursor Recognition of the hourglass as a symbol of time has survived its obsolescence as a timekeeper. For example, the American television soap opera Days of Our Lives, since its first broadcast in 1965, has displayed an hourglass in its opening credits, with the narration, \\"Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives,\\" spoken by Macdonald Carey. Various computer graphical user interfaces may change the pointer to an hourglass during a period when the program is in the middle of a task, and may not accept user input. During that period other programs, for example in different windows, may work normally. When such an hourglass does not disappear, it suggests a program is in an infinite loop and needs to be terminated, or is waiting for some external event (such as the user inserting a CD). Unicode has an HOURGLASS symbol at \`U+231B\` (‚åõ).

He also was a member of the Ohio Glory in the World League of American Football. He played college football at Indiana University. Early years Laufenberg grew up in Encino, California and was dubbed Babe by his brother Jeff because he was the youngest in the family. He attended Crespi Carmelite High School, where he was a two-year starter at quarterback and left as the school's all-time leading passer with 2,678 yards on 184 completions. As a senior, he received Parade All-American and All-Southern Section honors, after leading his team to the playoffs. He also played baseball and was drafted by the San Francisco Giants. College career Laufenberg accepted a football scholarship from Stanford University, where Bill Walsh was the head coach at the time. He was redshirted as a freshman behind Steve Dils. The next year John Elway enrolled at the school, so Laufenberg decided to transfer to the University of Missouri after being listed third-string on the depth chart. At the time, Missouri had just implemented the veer offense and Phil Bradley was the starting quarterback, so he opted to transfer at the end of his first semester to Los Angeles Pierce College near his home. In 1980, Laufenberg passed for 1,590 yards and received offers from Big Ten Conference schools. He accepted a scholarship from head coach Lee Corso at Indiana University, where he became a two-year starter at quarterback. As a junior, Laufenberg had a 3‚Äì8 record, registering 1,788 passing yards, 8 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. In his final year, he posted a 5‚Äì6 record, 2,468 passing yards, 11 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, receiving honorable-mention All-Big Ten honors. Laufenberg finished his college career with school records for single-season passing yards (2,468), single-game passing yards (390), career pass completions (361), single-season pass completions (217), single-game pass completions (34), single-season attempts (364), career completion percentage (.586), single- season completion percentage (.596). He also was 2‚Äì0 against Purdue University. Professional career=Washington Redskins (first stint) Laufenberg was selected by the Washington Redskins in the sixth round (168th overall) of the 1983 NFL Draft. He was also selected by the Chicago Blitz in the 20th round (235th overall) of the 1983 USFL Draft. As a rookie, he was declared inactive for every game as the third-string quarterback, on a team that reached Super Bowl XVIII. The next year, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a strained shoulder. In 1985, he competed with Jay Schroeder for the backup position behind Joe Theismann. He was waived on September 2, after the team decided to keep only two quarterbacks on the roster. San Diego Chargers (first stint) On October 1, 1985, Laufenberg was signed by the San Diego Chargers to backup Mark Herrmann after starter Dan Fouts suffered a knee injury, but was cut on October 15, to make room for quarterback Joe Dufek. Washington Redskins (second stint) On November 21, 1985, Laufenberg was signed to back up Jay Schroeder for the final five games of the season, after linebacker Lawrence Taylor broke Theismann's right leg on Monday Night Football. In 1986, he competed for a backup position in preseason against the recently signed Doug Williams and rookie Mark Rypien. He was released on August 26. Though he never appeared in a regular season or playoff game during his time with the Redskins, Laufenberg was a very popular player with the fans and the media. He was called \\"Mr. August\\" for his come- from-behind wins in preseason. New Orleans Saints On August 28, 1986, Laufenberg was claimed off waivers by the New Orleans Saints, but was released four days later, when the team decided to keep only two quarterbacks. On September 22, he was brought back after Bobby Hebert suffered a broken foot and got a chance to play in his first regular-season game, coming in to run out the clock in a 38‚Äì7 win against Tampa Bay. Kansas City Chiefs On May 28, 1987, Laufenberg was signed as a free agent by the Kansas City Chiefs and was released on September 1. Washington Redskins (third stint) On September 14, 1987, he was signed to serve as Williams' backup after Schroeder sprained his right shoulder in the season opener. The players would go on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the next games would be played with replacement players. Although he didn't cross the picket line, he was released when Schroeder returned to the lineup on October 27. Because he only was on the roster for two games, he missed out on getting a Super Bowl share by one game. San Diego Chargers (second stint) On April 21, 1988, he was signed as a free agent by the San Diego Chargers, reuniting with new offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome who was his quarterback coach with the Redskins. Presented with an opportunity to compete for the starter job that was left open with Fouts retirement, he beat out Mark Malone and got a chance to record his first start and thrown pass in the NFL. Laufenberg started the first 6 games of season, before suffering 3 broken ribs against the New Orleans Saints. He appeared in 8 games, registered 2 wins, while completing 69 of 144 passes for 778 yards with 4 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. He was cut on April 17, 1989. Dallas Cowboys In 1989, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys, reuniting with Rhome who was the team's quarterback coach. He would also make the roster by beating Scott Secules for the third-string quarterback job. In 1990, he was moved to the backup quarterback position after Steve Walsh was traded to the New Orleans Saints, 3 games into the season. The Cowboys had a 7‚Äì8 record and needed one win to secure a playoff berth, when Laufenberg was forced into action after quarterback Troy Aikman injured his right shoulder against the Philadelphia Eagles, resulting in a 17‚Äì3 loss. Facing the Atlanta Falcons (4-11) in the last game of the year as the starter, he completed 10 passes in 24 attempts for 129 yards and one touchdown, in a 26‚Äì7 loss that positioned the Saints for the final playoff wild card spot. The next season, the team went into training camp with Aikman, Laufenberg, Cliff Stoudt and fourth-round draft choice Bill Musgrave at quarterback. He was cut on July 30, 1991. On August 25, the Cowboys traded for Steve Beuerlein to improve the backup position and released Stoudt and Musgrave, opting to keep just 2 quarterbacks. Laufenberg is also credited with giving Daryl Johnston the nickname \\"Moose\\". In the offensive meetings, Johnston towered over the other fullbacks and Laufenberg said that he looked like, \\"A moose in a herd of deer\\". Ohio Glory (WLAF) In 1992, he was working as a sportscaster for the Cowboys' flagship radio station KVIL, when he was drafted number 2 overall by the Ohio Glory of the World League of American Football. He started the first 2 games before being passed on the depth chart by Pat O'Hara. He later got a chance to start in one additional game for an injured O'Hara. He posted 622 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, 6 interceptions and was sacked 14 times. Personal life Laufenberg was the lead sports anchor and Sports Director for KTVT television in Dallas, Texas, from 1997 to January 14, 2015, but continues to serve as a color analyst on the Dallas Cowboys Radio Network. His co-host, Brad Sham, has called him the best color analyst in the business. The National Sports Media Association has named him 'Texas Sportscaster of the Year' three times. In 2019, Laufenberg's son, Luke, died at age 21 of lymphoma.

FBAR devices using piezoelectric films with thicknesses ranging from several micrometres down to tenth of micrometres resonate in the frequency range of roughly 100 MHz to 20 GHz , . Any material like lead zirconate titanate (PZT) or barium strontium titanate (BST) from the list of piezoelectric materials could act as an active material in an FBAR resonator. However aluminium nitride (AlN) and zinc oxide are two most studied piezoelectric materials for FBAR realisations. As a two compound material and compatibility with the silicon integrated circuit technology AlN has become the most widely used in commercial volume manufacturing of FBAR resonator based products like radio frequency filters, duplexers, power amplifier or receiver modules, and sensors. Doping or adding new materials like scandium (Sc) are new directions to improve material properties of AlN for FBARs. Research of new electrode materials or alternative materials to aluminium like by replacing one of the metal electrodes with very light materials like graphene for minimising the loading of the resonator has been shown to lead better control of the resonance frequency. FBAR resonators can be manufactured on ceramic (Al2O3 or alumina), sapphire, glass or silicon substrates. However silicon wafer is the most common substrate due to its scalability towards mass manufacturing and compatibility with various manufacturing steps needed. During early studies and experimentation phase of thin film resonators in 1967 cadmium sulfide (CdS) was evaporated on a resonant piece of bulk quartz crystal which served as a transducer providing a quality factor of 5000 at the resonance frequency (279 MHz) . This was an enabler for tighter frequency control, for needs to use higher frequencies and utilising FBAR resonators. Most of the smartphones include year 2020 at least one FBAR based duplexer or filter and some 4/5G products may even include 20-30 functionalities based on FBAR technology mainly due to the increased complexity of radio frequency front end (RFFE, RF front end) electronics - both receiver and transmitter paths - and the antenna system. Trends to utilize RF spectrum more efficiently with higher frequencies than 1.5 GHz and in some cases also simultaneously with increasing RF output power have supported FBAR technology to become one of the key enabling technologies in telecommunication realisations.  Structures  Currently there are two known structures of thin-film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators: free-standing and solidly mounted (SMR) resonators . In a free- standing resonator structure air is used to separate the resonator from the substrate/surrounding. The structure of a free-standing resonator is based on some typical manufacturing steps used in micro-electromechanical systems MEMS. In an SMR structure acoustic mirror(s) providing an acoustic isolation is constructed between the resonator and the surrounding like the substrate. The acoustic mirror (Bragg reflector) typically consists of odd total number of materials with alternating a high and low acoustic impedance. The thickness of mirror materials must also be optimized to the quarter wavelength for maximum acoustic reflectivity. The basic principle of the SMR structure was introduced in 1965. If needed (for simplifying the final layout in the application) resonator structures can be stacked e.g. built on top of each other like in some filter applications. However this approach increases the complexity of manufacturing. Some performance requirements like tuning of the resonance frequency may also require additional process steps like ion milling, which complicates the manufacturing. Because realising FBAR structures needs many precise steps simulation is actively used during the design phase to predict purity of resonance frequency and other performance. At early phase of the development basic finite element method (FEM) based modelling techniques used for crystals were also applied and modified for FBARs , . Several new methods like a scanning laser interferometry were needed to visualise the functionality of the resonators and helping to improve the design (layout and cross-sectional structure of the resonator) to achieve purity of the resonance and wanted resonance modes .  Applications  In many applications temperature behavior, stability vs. time, strength and purity of the wanted resonance frequency are forming the base for the performance of the applications based on FBAR resonators. Material choices, layout and design of resonator structures are contributing to the resonator performance and the final performance of the application. Mechanical performance and reliability are determined by the packaging and structure of the resonators in the applications. A common application of FBARs is radio frequency (RF) filters for use in cell phones and other wireless applications like positioning (GPS, Glonass, BeiDou, Galileo (satellite navigation) etc.) systems and modules. Such filters are made from a network of resonators (either in half-ladder, full-ladder, lattice or stacked topologies) and are designed to remove unwanted frequencies from being transmitted in such devices, while allowing other specific frequencies to be received and transmitted. FBAR filters can also be found in duplexers. FBAR filters are complementing surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters in areas where increased power handling capability, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) tolerance is needed. Frequencies more than 1.5 GHz are well suited for FBAR devices. Because FBARs on a silicon substrate can be manufactured in high volumes and is supported by all development of semiconductor device fabrication methods. Future requirements of new applications like filtering bandwidth with steep stopband attenuation have effects on resonator performance and show development steps needed. FBARs can be used by oscillators and synchronizers to replace a crystal/crystals in applications where frequencies more than 100 MHz and/or very low jitter is one of the performance targets. FBARs are applicable sensor applications. For instance, when a FBAR device is put under mechanical pressure it's resonance frequency will shift. Sensing of humidity and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are demonstrated by using FBARs. A tactile sensor array may also consist of FBAR devices, and gravimetric sensing can be based on FBAR resonators. FBARs can also be integrated with power amplifiers (PA) or low noise amplifiers (LNA) to form either a module solution or a monolithic integrated solution on the same substrate with the related electronic circuitry. Typical module solutions are a power amplifier-duplexer module (PAD), or a low noise amplifier-filter module where FBAR(s) and the related circuitry are packaged in the same package possibly on a separate module substrate. FBARs can be integrated in complex communication like SimpleLink modules for avoiding area/space requirements of an external, packaged crystal. Therefore FBAR technology has a key role in electronics miniaturisation specifically in applications where oscillators and precise high performance filters are needed.  Historical and Industrial Landscape  The use of piezoelectric materials for different applications began in the early 1960s at Bell Telephone Laboratories/Bell Labs, where piezoelectric crystals were developed and used as resonators in applications like oscillators with frequencies up to 100 MHz. Thinning was applied for increasing the resonance frequency of the crystals. However there were limitations of the thinning of crystals and new methods of thin film manufacturing were applied in the early 1970s for increasing accuracy of resonance frequency and targeting increasing manufacturing volumes. TFR Technologies Inc founded in 1989 was one of the pioneering company in the field of FBAR resonators and filters mostly for space and military applications. The first product were delivered to customers in 1997 . TFR Technologies Inc was in 2005 acquired by TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. Beginning of 2015 RF Micro Devices (RFMD), Inc. and TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. announced to merge to form Qorvo active providing FBAR based products. HP Laboratories started a project on FBARs in 1993 concentrating in free-standing resonators and filters. In 1999 FBAR activity became part of Agilent Technologies Inc, which delivered year 2001 25000 FBAR duplexers for N-CDMA phones. Later in 2005 FBAR activity at Agilent was one of the technologies of Avago Technologies Ltd, which acquired Broadcom Corporation year 2015. In 2016 Avago Technologies Ltd changed its name to Broadcom Inc currently active to provide FBAR based products. Infineon Technologies AG started to work with SMR-FBARs in 1998 concentrating in telecommunication filters for mobile applications. The first product was delivered to Nokia Mobile Phones Ltd , which launched the first SMR-FBAR based GSM three band mobile phone product 2001. Infineon's FBAR (BAW) filter group was acquired by Avago Technologies Ltd 2008 which later became part of Broadcom Inc. After acquiring Panasonic's filtering business year 2016 Skyworks Solutions became one of the major players in BAW/FBAR devices additionally to Broadcom and Qorvo. Additionally some other companies like RF360 Holdings (joint venture of Qualcomm and TDK) and Kyocera are offering thin film resonator based products like RFFE modules and separate filters. Still many companies like Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (founded in 2014), Texas Instruments (TI), several universities and research institutes are offering and studying to improve FBAR technology, its performance, manufacturing, advancing design capabilities of FBARs and exploring new application areas jointly with system manufacturers and companies providing simulation tools (Ansys, OnScale, and Comsol Multiphysics etc.).

In 1016 he took charge of the chancery of the Kingdom of Italy, and became the first archchancellor in 1031. In 1021 he became Archbishop of Cologne. For his part in the imperial campaign against the South Italian principalities in 1022, the chronicler Amatus of Montecassino described him as \\"warlike\\". Early life Pilgrim belonged to Bavarian family of the Aribonids. He was born around 985. His father was Chadalhoh IV (died 11 September 1030), count of Isengau. His older brother, Chadalhoh V (died 29 October 1050), inherited the Isengau, while Pilgrim entered the church. He had important relations in the church, since his uncle Aribo was the archbishop of Mainz and his great-uncle Hartwig was the archbishop of Salzburg. Pilgrim's primary education began at Salzburg Cathedral under the direction of Hartwig, and there he became a canon as a young man. In 1015, through Hartwig's intervention, Pilgrim was appointed to the royal chapel. In 1016, when the Emperor Henry II founded Bamberg Cathedral he named Pilgrim its provost. After defeating his rival, Arduin, for the Kingdom of Italy, the emperor placed Pilgrim in charge of his separate Italian chancery. In 1016 Pilgrim undertook a journey to northern Italy to reconcile the emperor to those magnates who had supported Arduin. He was so successful that in January 1017 an Italian embassy travelled to the assembly then in session at Allstedt to greet the emperor. In the October or November 1017 Pilgrim returned to Germany, and in January 1018 the last hostage of the Otbertine family, which had supported Arduin, was released by Henry. On 17 April 1020, when Pope Benedict VIII celebrated Easter at Bamber, Pilgrim was present. In 1021 Pilgrim was rewarded with the archbishopric of Cologne. His appointment was made while his predecessor, Heribert (died 16 March), was still on his deathbed. He received his episcopal ordination on 29 June in the emperor's presence. Italian campaign of 1021‚Äì22 In December 1021, the Emperor Henry invaded Italy with a large army. He divided into three columns, the centre under himself and the wings under Pilgrim of Cologne and Poppo of Aquileia. Pilgrim's column marched down the Tyrrhenian coast towards the Principality of Capua, passing through Rome on its way. According to the Chronica monasterii Casinensis, this force numbered some 20,000 strong. Pilgrim was sent to arrest the abbot of Monte Cassino, Atenulf, and the prince of Capua, Pandulf IV. The former escaped and the latter, abandoned by his supporters and his Norman mercenaries, surrendered after the citizens opened the gates to the imperial army. Pilgrim then besieged the city of Salerno for forty days. When its prince, Guaimar III, offered to give hostages, Pilgrim accepted the prince's son and co-prince, Guaimar IV, and lifted the siege. Duke Sergius IV of Naples also offered hostages to Pilgrim to avoid a siege. Pilgrim then led his army east to join the siege of Troia already in progress. At Troia the emperor condemned Pandulf to death, but the archbishop intervened to get the sentence commuted to one year's imprisonment north of the Alps. Pilgrim also intervened to have Count Pandulf of Teano appointed prince of Capua in Pandulf IV's place. This was confirmed by an imperial diploma that, at Pilgrim's request, specifically mentioned the good relations between the imperial court and the Capuan princely dynasty. The siege of Troia dragged on from 12 April until late June, when the emperor, in pain from a gall stone, lifted it in order to attend a church council. Coronations of 1024 and 1028 After the campaigning in southern Italy was done (1022), Pilgrim went to Rome to receive his pallium from Pope Benedict VIII, who also bestowed on him the dignity of Apostolic Librarian (bibliothecarius). It is possible that the pope also bestowed on Pilgrim the right to crown the king of Germany on this occasion. He had returned to Germany by April 1024. On 4 September 1024, the princes of the Empire elected Conrad the Elder of the Salian dynasty as king and future emperor. At the meeting of the princes held at the field of Kamba on the Rhine,Across the river from Oppenheim and beside the royal castle of Tribur. Pilgrim, as de facto leader of the Lotharingian contingent, supported Conrad's cousin, Conrad the Younger. He further offended the emperor elect by leaving the assembly early. Conrad was crowned on 8 September by Aribo of Mainz, who refused to crown his wife, Gisela, on the grounds that their marriage was invalid and consanguineous. On 21 September Pilgrim crowned Gisela queen in Cologne Cathedral, which led to a rapid rapprochement between king and prelate. He tried to reconcile Duke Gothelo I of Lotharingia, but was unsuccessful. Pilgrim continued to benefit from Aribo and Conrad's estrangement when, at Aachen on 14 April 1028 (Easter Sunday), he crowned Conrad and Gisela's son, Henry III, following his election as King of Germany to replace his father, who had been crowned emperor by the pope. A convention was established, and from this point on the archbishops of Cologne crowned the kings of Germany. In June 1031, Conrad appointed Pilgrim archchancellor for Italy, an honour that remained with the archbishops of Cologne throughout the Middle Ages. Diocesan projects Pilgrim was a reformer and a builder, extending the western suburbs of his city by the foundation of the Romanesque basilica of the Holy Apostles (1022/4), a mint (c. 1027) and a new market. On 8 November 1029 he consecrated the abbey of Brauweiler. His extensive influence in the Rhineland involved him a dispute over the right to the tithes of the land between the Rhine and the Ruhr with Sophia, abbess of Gandersheim and Essen. His wealth and learning are evident in his rich donations to his own cathedral and to Monte Cassino. The musical theorist Berno of Reichenau dedicated his work on the tonarius to Pilgrim. Pilgrim supported the Cluniac reforms, and took part in the negotiations between Henry II and King Robert II of France in August 1023. He attended the council of Frankfurt in September 1027. His last major action was to oppose the appointment of Conrad the Younger to the Duchy of Carinthia in 1035. Pilgrim died suddenly in Nijmegen while attending the wedding of Henry III and Gunhilda of Denmark. He was buried in the church he had founded dedicated to the Holy Apostles.

Members of The Prophecy refused to follow the Code of Honor, and at times tried to prevent others from doing so as well. Members The members of The Prophecy were Christopher Daniels, Simply Luscious, Donovan Morgan, Xavier, Dan Maff, Mark Briscoe, Allison Danger, and B.J. Whitmer. Samoa Joe briefly worked for The Prophecy, but was never a member. Jim Cornette briefly joined The Prophecy, but was kicked out the same night for obeying the Code of Honor. History=Formation (2002) Christopher Daniels competed in the main event of the debut ROH show, The Era of Honor Begins, against Low Ki and American Dragon. After losing to Low Ki, Daniels became a villain and refused to shake hands with either opponent, breaking the Code of Honor. The three competed against each other the following show in a Round Robin tournament. After defeating Dragon on the opening match, Daniels forced him to shake his hand because \\"the better man won\\". However, after losing to Low Ki in his second match, he refused to shake his hand, and said he would not wrestle Low Ki again unless the ROH Championship (which had not been created yet) was on the line. At Night of Appreciation, Daniels wrestled Donovan Morgan in a singles match. Before the match Daniels said in a backstage interview that he had a lot of respect for Morgan because they were both California wrestlers and they had both won the ECWA Super 8 Tournament, but after he lost he refused to shake Morgan's hand. He said it was not because he did not respect Morgan, but because he believed the Code of Honor was a lie. The two then formed a partnership. At Road to the Title, The Prophecy was officially created. Daniels revealed he had seen a prophecy, where he was to lead a group of elite athletes and destroy the Code of Honor, and rebuild ROH in their image. He then announced the first official member Simply Luscious, who felt she had been mistreated by Ring of Honor since the first show. Daniels attempted to become the first ROH Champion when he competed in a sixty-minute iron man match against Low Ki, Spanky and Doug Williams at Crowning a Champion. Despite being the only wrestler to be neither pinned nor submitted, Daniels lost the title to his rival Low Ki. The Prophecy got their revenge two shows later at Unscripted. During Low Ki's title defense against Xavier, Daniels came to the ring to distract him. While Low Ki was distracted, Xavier attacked him from behind and, with the help of Daniels, beat him with a chair and a cement pole. Low Ki crawled back into the ring and was pinned by Xavier, making him the new ROH Champion. After the match, it was made clear that Xavier was the newest member of The Prophecy. Later that night, Daniels and Morgan defeated American Dragon and Mike Modest in the finals of a one night tournament to become the first ROH Tag Team Champions. Even though Daniels and Morgan won the title, any members could defend them. At Glory by Honor, The Prophecy refused to put any of the titles on the line. The Prophecy wanted Xavier to wrestle someone who he could easily beat and, at the advice of Mark Briscoe, squared off against Jay Briscoe. Despite having lost the majority of his matches in ROH, Jay scored a major upset by beating the ROH Champion. Later, The Prophecy's hired assassin Samoa Joe (in his Ring of Honor debut) faced Low Ki in ROH's first Fight Without Honor. After losing the hard-hitting battle, Joe showed his true colors by obeying the Code of Honor and shaking Low Ki's hand. In the main event, Daniels faced Doug Williams in a grudge match from Crowning a Champion. Angry over Daniels's refusal to shake his hand after the match, Williams challenged him to a match where if he lost Daniels would have to disband The Prophecy and adhere to the Code of Honor. If Williams lost, however, he would no longer be allowed to shake and therefore continually broke the Code of Honor. After winning, Daniels mocked Williams by offering to shake his hand. Despite some tension between The Prophecy and Samoa Joe, who refused to ruin his integrity by disobeying the Code of Honor, The Prophecy continued to be successful for the remainder of the year. At Scramble Madness, rival brothers Jay and Mark Briscoe faced each other in a tag match. Jay chose Amazing Red as his partner, while Mark chose Daniels. After winning the match and becoming the newest member of The Prophecy, Daniels told Mark's parents, who were in the front row, that The Prophecy was Mark's family now. Feud with The Group (2002‚Äì2003) At Final Battle 2002, while Daniels and Simply Luscious were in the ring talking with Gary Michael Capetta, Steve Corino, Daniel's friend and Luscious' real life boyfriend, came out and said he was going to form a group of his own, one that was so elite it did not even need a name, and they were going to take all the belts in Ring of Honor. He then threatened to break up with Luscious because she was a member of The Prophecy, but stopped when she left them and join The Group. Samoa Joe, also tired of Daniels and The Prophecy, left to join his friend and fellow Pro Wrestling Zero1 wrestler Corino as a member of The Group. Corino said that it was only business and not to be taken personally by Christopher Daniels. Daniels responded by bringing Allison Danger, the real life sister of Steve Corino, into The Prophecy, and start a feud between the two factions. At Expect the Unexpected, Daniels and Xavier lost the tag team title to A. J. Styles and Amazing Red. Less than two weeks later, Xavier, having suffered a concussion in the tag match, defended the ROH Championship against Samoa Joe. Christopher Daniels and Allison Danger were in his corner, but Michael Shane, the newest member of The Group, came down superkicked him, and the two were cared to the back by The Group. Xavier then lost the title to Joe. He then took time off from ROH, and The Prophecy, to heal. With Xavier gone, Morgan rarely in Ring of Honor anymore, and Mark Briscoe quietly leaving The Prophecy to form a tag team with his brother, Daniels began to search out new members for The Prophecy. At The Epic Encounter, Dan Maff walked out on his partner Monsta Mack after losing to The Backseat Boyz. Later that night, Daniels wrestled Homicide, Maff's trainer, in a singles match. After the match, The Group ran down and attacked both wrestlers. Maff ran down and chased them away, seemingly to help his trainer, but ripped off his \\"Repeat Offenders\\" shirt to reveal a Prophecy shirt underneath. He then threw his old shirt on top a Homicide's unconscious face and walked away with Daniels and Danger. After the show, he was confronted by Monsta Mack, who wanted to know why he joined The Prophecy. Maff told him that he was getting nowhere in ROH by obeying the Code of Honor, but that he could rise to the top by siding with Daniels. The two wrestled one final match together at Retribution: Round Robin Challenge II. After losing, Maff and Daniels attacked Monsta Mack. In the Round Robin tournament, Daniels defeated both Amazing Red and Paul London to win the tournament. After the main event, when Samoa Joe (along with Michael Shane) defeated Doug Williams, The Prophecy ran down and attacked The Group. At Night of the Grudges, The Prophecy and The Group squared off in their first and only match against each other. The two factions wrestled in a six-man tag match with Daniels, Maff and Morgan facing Samoa Joe, CW Anderson and Michael Shane (who was subbing for Steve Corino who pulled out the night before), where the losing faction had to disband. The Prophecy won when Maff pinned the ROH Champion Samoa Joe. Donovan Morgan left ROH, and thus The Prophecy, after the match. As a result of pinning the champion, Maff was granted a match for the ROH Championship at Wrestle Rave 2003. His father died the day before his match, and Maff, despite his best efforts, was unable to defeat Joe in the emotional match, which he dedicated to his father. Cornette and Xavier (2003) The Prophecy tried to get back on track at Wrath of the Racket, when manager Jim Cornette made his ROH debut and aligned himself with The Prophecy. Cornette, known as a tag team specialist, he thought The Prophecy was a great team and managed them in the match for the ROH Tag Team Championship against A.J. Styles and Amazing Red. During intermission, when Styles and Red (who already had an injured knee going into the event), The Prophecy and Cornette attacked them. Red injured his knee to such a degree that he was not able to compete that night, and A.J. Styles was left to find another partner or face The Prophecy by himself. Styles chose Dan Maff's former trainer Homicide as his partner, and the two went on to successfully retain the titles. Cornette, despite being a member of The Prophecy, shook the hands of Styles and Homicide because the better team won. He then got into a heated argument with Christopher Daniels for letting him down and losing. The Prophecy then turned on Cornette and attacked him, until Samoa Joe and Amazing Red came to his aid. After the show, Lucy, a member of Second City Saints member and the real life girlfriend of CM Punk (who had previously turned down Daniels' offer to join The Prophecy) was attacked by an unknown assailant. Punk, who was on a tour in Japan at the time, began a long search after his return to discover who her attacker was. Xavier, making his ROH in-ring return at Bitter Friends, Stiffer Enemies, and faced the leader of The Prophecy Daniels for the number one contendership for the ROH World Championship. The two got into an argument before the match due to Xavier saying that since he was the ROH Champion when he was in The Prophecy, he was the leader, and Daniels played second-fiddle to him. Daniels won the match and the title shot, but it was left unclear if Xavier was still a member of The Prophecy. Later that night, Dan Maff faced off against his former friend Low Ki. The referee stopped the match after Low Ki legitimately knocked Maff out after kicking him in the head. At Glory by Honor II, Xavier competed in his first match of the \\"Field of Honor\\" tournament. He came out with valet Lollipop, adding to the mystery of whether he was still a member of The Prophecy. Allison Danger came out and demanded to know why Lollipop was there, but Xavier sent her back to the locker room, confirming he was no longer a member. In the main event, Christopher Daniels wrestled Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship. The Prophecy suffered a bit of false hope when, after a close two-count, the time keeper rung the bell thinking the match was over and Daniels had won. The referee explained it was only a two-count and the match continued, until Joe defeated Daniels. Feud with the Second City Saints and dissolution (2003‚Äì2004) During this time, The Prophecy began to feud with the Second City Saints over the attack on Lucy. CM Punk, seeing The Prophecy as their biggest rival (and vice versa) figured they had to be behind the attack in order to maintain their spot as the most dominant faction in Ring of Honor. Punk continuously confronted and called out the members of The Prophecy. At The Conclusion Punk confronted Dan Maff about the attack, who swore on his father's grave that The Prophecy was not behind it. The following night, Punk called out Daniels and demanded to know if The Prophecy was behind the attack. Daniels said they were not, but Punk did not believe him. Punk attacked Daniels and hit him with his own signature move, the Angel's Wings. At Final Battle 2003 Punk had enough and called out The Prophecy. They came out but were soon attacked by the Saints. As Colt Cabana tied Daniels up in the ropes, Punk wrapped a towel around Allison Danger's throat and threatened to kill her if Daniels didn't admit to the attack. B.J. Whitmer, whom Punk had knocked out in their first match and subsequently often insulted on commentary, ran out and attacked Colt Cabana with a chair, freeing Daniels. Daniels chased Punk out of the ring and announced that The Prophecy was behind the attack, but he did not do it. Instead, The Prophecy's newest member BJ Whitmer had been the one who attacked Lucy. Maff, who swore on his father's grave The Prophecy wasn't behind the attack, was shocked and upset by this news, but stayed in the group. Later that night, Daniels and Maff wrestled the Great Muta and Arashi in an interpromotional match between Ring of Honor and All Japan Pro Wrestling. After defeating The Prophecy, the Great Muta offered to shake Daniels' hand, who once again refused. Instead, Daniels, Maff and Allison Danger bowed in a sign of respect. At The Battle Lines are Drawn, ROH's first show of 2004, The Prophecy and the Second City Saints' war came to a head, and the two teams faced in a six-man tag match. The two teams fought throughout the arena, causing the referee to end the match in a no contest. During the match, Dan Maff was left badly beaten by the hands of the Saints. BJ Whitmer was also taken out, leaving only Daniels to fight of CM Punk, Colt Cabana and Ace Steel after the match. He was easily outnumbered, and the Saints Pepsi Plunged him off the top turnbuckle, through a table. Daniels missed the next several weeks due to injury. At The Last Stand, Maff and Whitmer competed against each other in a four-corner survival match for the number one contendership for the ROH World Championship. There was already tension between the two Prophecy members due to the events of Final Battle, and this match added to their tensions. The match ended with a double pin, as both Maff and Whitmer pinned Matt Stryker and former Prophecy member Xavier at the same time. The two then both got to wrestle Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship at the Second Anniversary Show. In the opening match of the show, CM Punk came out to the ring dressed as Christopher Daniels. He then began to brag about ending the Christopher Daniels reign in Ring of Honor, adding more fuel to the fire in the two factions‚Äô feud. In the ROH World Championship match, Whitmer and Maff once again squared off against each other when they faced both Joe and Low Ki. Despite the tension, the two worked together in order to insure the title came back to The Prophecy. However, they were unable to get the job done, and Joe retained the title. At At Our Best, The Prophecy faced the Second City Saints in a match for the number one contendership for the ROH Tag Team Championships. The two teams‚Äô hatred for each other led to a double disqualification. This show was also the final show before the Rob Feinstein controversy. As a result of the show, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pulled all their contracted wrestlers, Christopher Daniels being one of them, from all ROH shows. The Prophecy was now without a leader. The Prophecy scored two victories in their war with the Second City Saints, as BJ Whitmer defeated Colt Cabana at Reborn: Stage 1, and Ace Steel at Reborn: Stage 2. After the Saints won the ROH Tag Team Championship at Reborn: Stage 2, Whitmer ran down to the ring and attacked CM Punk and Colt Cabana. Ace Steel emerged from the back and laid Whitmer out with a chair shot to the head, before celebrating with the Saints. At Round Robin Challenge III The Prophecy faced both the Second City Saints and the Briscoe Brothers in a round robin tournament. Whitmer and Maff beat Punk and Cabana to win not only the match, but also the ROH Tag Team Championship. Their reign was short lived, as they lost the titles to the Briscoe Brothers later that same night. The Prophecy got another shot at the title at Generation Next when they faced the Second City Saints, who had won the title back in the final match of the round robin tournament. Despite having gotten the best of the Saints for the past three shows, The Prophecy was defeated after CM Punk Pepsi Plunged Whitmer. Later in the evening, CM Punk called out Ricky Steamboat, whom he had been feuding with. The two began to fight with Steamboat having the upper hand, until Colt Cabana ran out and the Second City Saints double teamed him. The Prophecy ran out and chased off the Saints, rescuing Steamboat. At World Title Classic, The Prophecy and the Second City Saints fought against each other, as well as against the Briscoe Brothers and Generation Next, in ROH's first Ultimate Endurance match. The match was an elimination match, and after a team was eliminated the rules changed, essentially making it three matches in one. The first match, a submission match, ended with the elimination of Generation Next by The Prophecy. The second match, a scramble tag match, ended with the elimination of the Briscoe Brothers, again by The Prophecy. The Prophecy and the Saints then fought in a falls count anywhere match. The two teams fought all over the arena and used weapons such as chairs and tables to hurt each other. The Prophecy won after Maff gave Colt Cabana a Burning Hammer off the top rope, through a table. After the match, Dan Maff, knowing that Christopher Daniels won't return to Ring of Honor, convinced BJ Whitmer that they should drop The Prophecy name and go out on their own. Whitmer agreed and the two walked away from The Prophecy, as well as Allison Danger. The Prophecy was now officially ended. Aftermath Dan Maff and BJ Whitmer spent the next year feuding with Allison Danger, who was angry at them for leaving The Prophecy. She hired numerous wrestlers, including the Carnage Crew, to face the two in a series of hardcore matches. After Mick Foley made his ROH debut, he praise Whitmer and Maff for their hardcore work, and said that to him ROH stand for \\"Ring of Hardcore\\". Foley then feuded with Ricky Steamboat, who did not approve of hardcore wrestling. Foley chose Whitmer and Maff as his hardcore tag team, and the two faced Ricky Steamboat's pure wrestlers of Nigel McGuinness and Chad Collyer. At the Third Anniversary Celebration: Part , Maff and Whitmer defeated The Rottweilers (Ricky Reyes and Rocky Romero) to become two-time ROH Tag Team Champions. Their reign was short lived as Dan Maff was forced out of ROH a month later after having a falling out with his trainer Homicide. Whitmer then teamed with Jimmy Jacobs and once again became an ROH Tag Team Champion. Christopher Daniels made his long-awaited ROH return at Death before Dishonor III. Allison Danger came out earlier in the show to announce that Daniels was on his way back, and that he was going to reform The Prophecy. After the main event, when CM Punk won the ROH World Championship in his final match for ROH before leaving for WWE, he turned heel and said he was going to take the title with him when he left. He then challenged anyone in the locker room to try and stop him. While Punk watched the entrance ramp expecting to see someone like Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels (to a huge response from the audience) ran in through the crowd behind him. Daniels and Punk began to brawl while the fans chanted \\"Ring the Bell!\\" Punk ran out of the ring and out of the building, still holding the ROH title. Daniels tried for the next several shows to win the ROH title, but was unable to do so. Danger would resume her role as Daniels' manager for the rest of his ROH term. At Hell Freezes Over in 2006, BJ Whitmer attacked Christopher Daniels because he walked out of ROH and The Prophecy in 2004. The two fought at the Fourth Anniversary Show, but their match was ended after wrestlers from Combat Zone Wrestling took over the ring. Whitmer went on to become a member of \\"Team ROH\\" along with Samoa Joe, Adam Pearce and Ace Steel and helped fight off the CZW invasion. At The 100th, Daniels made ROH history as, for the first time ever, he respectfully shook Claudio Castagnoli's hand after their match, adhering to the \\"Code of Honor\\" (Castagnoli then betrayed ROH later that night and joined his best friend Chris Hero with CZW). Later in the year, Daniels became a two- time ROH Tag Team Champion, as he and Matt Sydal defeated The Kings of Wrestling (Hero and Castagnoli).

Its 79-year commercial service life began with towing sailing ships over the Columbia River bar, and ended with hauling bundled log rafts on the Strait of Juan de Fuca in 1968. Northwest Seaport now preserves the tug as a museum ship in Seattle, Washington. The tug's long service in the Pacific Northwest, including a role in the Klondike Gold Rush, was interrupted by preparations for war in early 1941. After delivering a drydock gate to Pearl Harbor the tug was chartered by Contractors Pacific Naval Air Bases, a consortium formed to build air fields on remote Pacific islands as the United States prepared for war. In June 1941 Arthur Foss was supporting construction on Wake Island and was there in November along with the smaller Justine Foss transporting construction materials from barges in the lagoon to the island. When the work was completed the tug was scheduled to return to Hawaii with two barges in tow. The captain, concerned about the warnings of war, left the island without refueling. The smaller tug had to refuel and remained to do so. Arthur Foss was about twelve hours into the voyage to Honolulu when word of the attack on Pearl Harbor was received. The tug's crew repainted the tug with what paint was available and kept radio silence. The tug, overdue and thought lost, was spotted by Navy patrol planes and made Pearl Harbor on 28 December with fuel for less than a day's operation left. The crew of Justine Foss were captured when the island was taken by the Japanese with all but one eventually executed. The Navy put Arthur Foss in service as a yard tug under the name Dohasan from early 1942 until February 1945. The tug was laid up until 1947 when it was returned to Foss and transported to its home area where it was rehabilitated for company service in 1948. It served the company for twenty more years until retirement in July 1968. Construction and early operations lightship in the background is probably on station at the Columbia River entrance. Wallowa was built in 1889 in Portland, Oregon for the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company (OR & N). The hull was designed by noted shipbuilder David Stephenson, and constructed by the shipyard/machinery firm of Willamette Iron and Steel Works. The twin inclined (or \\"bilge\\") steam engines for the new vessel came from an older tug, Donald, which was retired from service that year. As built, Wallowa was listed as long, with a beam of and a depth of hold of . According to another report, Wallowa was roughly long; this is in fact the overall length. The hull was launched in summer 1889, and fitting out was completed by September. On the 3rd, Captain George A. Pease, one of the most experienced pilots on the Columbia River, took Wallowa downriver from Portland to Astoria, Oregon. Although it is unknown if all were present for the maiden voyage, A.F. Goodrich and John S. Kidd served as engineers on the tug in its early years, as did John Melville. The first master of Wallowa in service was Captain R.E. Howes. Howes was born in 1846 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and had been captain of Wallowa predecessor Donald. Donald had been used to tow sailing vessels across the dangerous bar at the mouth of the Columbia River, and Wallowa was placed into the same service, operating out of Astoria. The new tug was taken on its first inspection trip across the bar on 23 September 1889, starting out from Astoria at 0300 hours. Present on board were a number of OR & N officials, including the chief of maritime and riverine operations, Captain James W. Troup. Wallowa returned to Astoria that afternoon, having been found to be fully satisfactory for bar service. The tug went on to successfully perform its intended duties in this dangerous service for the next nine years. Klondike Gold Rush service This early photograph of Wallowa towing is believed to have been taken somewhere in Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush (1898-1900). In 1898, caught up in the shipping boom caused by the Klondike Gold Rush, the OR & N leased Wallowa to the White Star Line to tow that company's large, famous sidewheeler Yosemite north up the Inside Passage to St. Michael, Alaska. (That town was a major gateway to the gold fields via the Yukon River.) An early return voyage to Seattle from Skagway towing the bark Columbia nearly resulted in the loss of Wallowa on 1 November 1898. A strong gale drove the tug ashore near Mary Island, north of Portland Canal on the southeast Alaska coast. Wallowa was found to have suffered no damage and was successfully refloated on the next high tide, but three days later Columbia was stranded at the mouth of Portland Canal and became a total loss. Wallowa was able to safely endure the rest of the stormy voyage to Seattle. Wallowa's strong construction continued to serve it in good stead. The tug made many subsequent voyages up the Inside Passage transporting supply barges and construction materials for the mining camps. By 1900, Wallowa was listed as working for the Pacific Clipper Line under Captain E. Caine, carrying mail and supplies between Juneau, Haines, Skagway, and Seattle. In 1903, the tug returned to Puget Sound and was sold into the timber industry a year later. There is only one other Alaskan gold rush vessel still in existence: the privately owned 1890 wooden tugboat Elmore. Puget Sound Mill & Timber Company service Hiram N. Chittenden Locks in Ballard. This photo was taken in August 1923 as Wallowa headed back into salt water. In 1904, Wallowa was purchased by lumber baron Mike Earles, owner of Puget Sound Mill & Timber Company (PSM & T Co.), based at Port Angeles. For the next 25 years, the tug towed log rafts from the Port Crescent \\"booming grounds\\" on the Olympic Peninsula to sawmills in Bellingham. At some point shortly after acquiring Wallowa, Earles had the tug refitted and re-powered with a new boiler and a new vertical double-expansion steam engine to replace the worn and obsolete inclined \\"bilge engines\\" originally fitted to the old Donald. Wallowa emerged from the refit with much more power and towing capability than before. It performed reliable work for the PSM & T Co. without any significant layups, except for a rebuild of the main deckhouse following a fire in 1927. During this period the vessel was mostly under the command of Captain Frank Harrington. In early 1929, Earles sold Wallowa to a neighboring timber concern: Merrill & Ring Logging Company, formed in 1886 by two families established in the lumber business back in Michigan and Minnesota. T.D. Merrill and Clark Ring had formed their joint venture after arriving in the Pacific Northwest to scout timberlands, acquiring large tracts around the Pysht River. The company still owns these today. Wallowa undertook the same types of jobs for Merrill & Ring as it had for the PSM & T Co., but operating primarily between booming grounds at Pysht and Port Angeles. However, after less than a year, Merrill & Ring decided to sell the tug. Foss Launch & Tug Company service (pre-war) Foss Launch & Tug Company (Foss) purchased Wallowa in late 1929, and the vessel became among the first of that company's large, seagoing acquisitions. To help pay off the large purchase, Foss donated a previously agreed-upon amount of towing services to Merrill & Ring, then in 1931 leased Wallowa to MGM Studios for filming the 1933 blockbuster hit Tugboat Annie. That film, the first major motion picture filmed in Washington state, became a huge success and made Wallowa (unofficially renamed \\"Narcissus\\" during filming) a movie star. Annual tugboat races have long been held at Puget Sound ports, but became more popular after the success of Tugboat Annie. After its 1934 rebuild, Arthur Foss (second from right) was always the favorite and frequent winner, capable of up to 13 knots. This photograph was taken in 1940 on Commencement Bay. Afterward, Wallowa was returned to Foss, which rebuilt and modernized the tug from its main deck up at company headquarters in Tacoma in 1934. The primary component of the rebuild was installation of a state-of-the-art, six cylinder, four-stroke, Washington Iron Works direct-drive diesel engine, which made the tug the most powerful on the West Coast. At re-launch, Foss renamed the tug Arthur Foss in honor of the company president and eldest son of company founder Thea Foss. Following successful trials, Arthur Foss went into commercial service as the Foss company flagship. However, steering troubles were presumably encountered, for a pneumatic power-steering assist system was installed in 1937. This was likely needed because increased right-hand torque from the propeller due to the more powerful engine made manual steering difficult for a single person. For nearly three years following modernization, Arthur Foss was utilized primarily for coastal tows to California, Oregon, and Alaska, based mostly out of Tacoma. The tug set several speed and tonnage hauled records, most notably while towing large lumber schooners down the coast to California. The most famous of these voyages occurred in 1936 under the command of Captain W. B. Sporman when, battling bad weather the whole time, Arthur Foss towed the large four-masted schooner Commodore, loaded with of lumber, from Oregon to Los Angeles in a record seven days. During this period the tug also frequently towed log rafts, ships, and barges along the Inside Passage as it had during the gold rush. Disaster struck on 18 February 1937, when a severe fire broke out in the forward crew quarters. In order to save Arthur Foss, Captain J.M. Bowers deliberately steered the tug into shallow water near Discovery Bay and sank it, extinguishing the fire. Several other vessels came to assistance, and Arthur Foss was refloated and taken to Tacoma for repairs. The large lumber schooner Commodore, in tow of the tugboat Arthur Foss, arrives at Los Angeles in record time, 1936. By late 1937, Arthur Foss was back in service with a new power steering system and a new, extremely skillful captain. In November both tug and captain, Martin Guchee, were commended for towing the disabled motorship Eastern Prince from Yakutat, Alaska to Seattle in just six days. Captain Guchee was also at the helm when Arthur Foss became in involved in the construction of two of the Northwest's most famous landmarks. In 1938, the tug made a long tow from San Francisco with the giant barge Foss No. 64, which had been used in the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. Foss No. 64 was needed up north for the construction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge which began in September 1938. The bridge was completed in 1940 and, after just a few months in service, collapsed in high winds due to aeroelastic flutter. Students of physics and structural engineering have been studying the infamous event ever since. In January 1939, construction of another famous bridge began on Lake Washington, the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge connecting Seattle to Mercer Island. Prior to construction, extensive testing of the pontoons' strength and stability occurred over a nine-month period in 1938. An experimental barge approximating the proposed bridge's configuration was anchored in the lake, and the most powerful tug on the West Coast was hired to put it to the test. Captain Guchee took Arthur Foss at full speed around and around the test barge, generating four-foot waves and simulating lake conditions in an wind. Engineers and technicians were on hand to take readings. The test barge held, but not satisfied with the amount of stress he was putting it under, Captain Guchee put Arthur Foss bow against the barge and \\"gave her full power\\". The anchoring system still held. Utilizing the data gathered during this unorthodox experiment and others, the world's first floating highway bridge was completed in 1940. To this day, there are only five similar floating spans in the world, and three are located in Washington State. After its involvement with the two soon-to-be-famous bridges, Arthur Foss returned to its normal towing duties up and down the coast. Captain Vince Miller was in command at this time. After a record barge tow of of lumber to Los Angeles in late 1940, on 8 February 1941 the tug departed Tacoma for Oakland, California to pick up a barge carrying a huge gate for one of the U.S. Navy's dry docks at Pearl Harbor. Arthur Foss and tow departed for Hawaii on 15 February 1941 and arrived without mishap two weeks later. The crew thought they were on just another routine job and would soon be returning home. World War II service Arthur Foss successfully delivered the drydock gate to the navy yard at Pearl Harbor in early March 1941. Instead of returning to the West Coast, the vessel was chartered by Foss to a consortium of civilian engineering firms: Contractors Pacific Naval Air Bases (CPNAB), which had been formed in January 1941 to begin construction of military bases on strategic Pacific atolls, including Wake Island. Arthur Foss's first assignment with CPNAB was towing gravel barges from Kaneohe to Honolulu for construction of airport runways. This work lasted until June, when the tug was assigned to a regular run between Hawaii and Wake towing barges of construction materials and military supplies for the airfield and barracks there. Meanwhile, the United States quietly prepared for the coming of war. In November, amid increasing U.S.-Japanese tensions, the tug was again dispatched from Honolulu under the command of Captain Oscar Rolstad to Wake towing two fully loaded barges. Upon arrival, Arthur Foss was joined by the smaller Justine Foss in the atoll harbor. Offloading the barges and lightering the equipment ashore occupied the two tug crews for the next few weeks. Upon completion of the work, Arthur Foss was scheduled to return to Honolulu towing two 1,000-ton fuel barges (empty). Departure from Wake was expected in the first week of December. Arthur Foss was the last vessel escape Wake Island on 8 December 1941 (7 December on the U.S. side of the International Date Line). This photograph was taken on 5 December. Work was completed on schedule. Arthur Foss needed to refuel before undertaking the voyage back to Hawaii. Captain Rolstad and the crew were extremely anxious to leave as soon as possible. By the early morning of 8 December 1941 (7 December on the other side of the International Date Line), three war warnings had been issued over the radio, and Captain Rolstad decided to forego refueling. He took Arthur Foss and tow to sea. Twelve hours out of Wake, news of the attack on Pearl Harbor was received. Japanese naval air forces simultaneously attacked Wake. Painted a highly visible white and green, Arthur Foss was a ripe target standing \\"out like a chain of coral islands on the empty sea\\", and Captain Rolstad was acutely aware of the likelihood of being bombed or torpedoed. While underway, the crew hastily mixed all white paint on board with engine grease to repaint the tug dark gray to help blend in with the ocean. All lights were blacked out and Arthur Foss proceeded under radio silence. Still towing the two barges at barely more than walking speed, the crew debated whether they should head for Alaska or Hawaii. No one was certain if they had enough fuel to reach either place, or whether when/if they arrived they would find the enemy in control. The decision was made to follow original orders and head to Honolulu at reduced speed to conserve as much fuel as possible. crucifix bitt, and bow with large \\"335\\" in white are visible behind the other tugboats in the foreground. The photograph was taken in 1947 after the tug was returned to Foss at Tacoma. Arthur Foss and tow were spotted by U.S. naval scout planes and escorted into Pearl Harbor on 28 December 1941, where Admiral Claude Bloch cited the crew for action beyond the call of duty. Due to the reduced speed of the voyage, they were a week overdue and had been presumed missing in action. According to Captain Rolstad's log, less than 500 U.S. gallons of fuel remained when they docked (this was the equivalent of running on fumes, as the main engine uses about 42 U.S. gallons per hour). Arthur Foss was ultimately the last vessel to escape Wake before Japanese forces captured the island on 23 December 1941, after a prolonged and bloody siege. After Arthur Foss departure, only a few flights of Pan Am flying boats carrying employees and some civilian contractors were able to escape. The crew of Justine Foss, which unlike Arthur Foss had remained to refuel, was captured and used as forced labor. Justine Foss itself was scuttled by the Japanese. All members of the crew except Thea Foss's grandson Drew (who had been removed to a prisoner of war camp in Burma) were executed along with all the remaining captives in 1943. Arthur Foss was placed in service by the U.S. Navy in early 1942, renamed Dohasan and designated YT-335 (harbor tug) and later YTM-335 (district harbor tug, medium). The tug continued to tow supply barges between bases in the Hawaiian archipelago and even ventured as far as French Frigate Shoals, northwest of Oahu. Dohasan towed a large grab dredge to the Shoals on 8 August 1942 for construction of an emergency landing strip there, then remained as a tender to the dredge as it removed material from the lagoon and deposited it ashore to build up and form a runway. The tug returned to Hawaii after three months of this work, but afterward apparently spent a lot of time idle as navy crews were unfamiliar with operation of the main engine. After the war ended in September 1945, Dohasan continued in naval service until being stricken from the Navy List on 7 February 1945 and lay up at Honolulu through 1946. The tug was finally returned to Foss Launch & Tug Company ownership in fall 1947, and renamed Arthur Foss. To return the worn-out tug to the West Coast, CPNAB secured it in a floating drydock and had it towed to Los Angeles. During the stormy voyage, rough seas knocked Arthur Foss off its keel blocks, heavily damaging the hull. Upon arrival back in Tacoma, Foss began a comprehensive rehabilitation of the tug which occupied it until August 1948. Foss Launch & Tug Company service (post-war) Between 1948 and 1968, Arthur Foss was kept hard at work towing bundled log rafts on the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Upon completion of repairs, the newly refurbished Arthur Foss was assigned to Foss's Port Angeles division with the task of towing log cribs and later bundled log rafts in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, mostly under contract to Crown Zellerbach, Rayonier, and Weyerhaeuser. Each raft averaged about of timber. Arthur Foss operated between Neah Bay, Sekiu, Clallam Bay, Pysht, Port Crescent, and Port Angeles; and continued this work for 20 years, setting the record for the longest uninterrupted towing service in the Straits. During this period the tug was almost exclusively under the command of captains Lynn Davis and Arnold Tweter. In 1964 during annual overhaul the tug was renamed Theodore Foss in honor of Thea Foss's eldest brother-in-law; a brand-new oceangoing tug took on the venerable name Arthur Foss that year. Upon retirement in July 1968, Theodore Foss was moved to Tacoma and sat idle for the next two years. In 1970, the vessel was donated to Northwest Seaport by Foss Launch & Tug Company and renamed Arthur Foss once again (since no longer part of the commercial fleet). Henry Foss himself, youngest and last surviving son of Thea Foss, presided at the official transfer ceremony. Museum ship and National Historic Landmark Arthur Foss, running with a volunteer crew, was a common and well-loved sight on Puget Sound and Elliott Bay until 2001, when operations ended pending a full-scale restoration. Northwest Seaport volunteers cleaned and organized the tug's interior and refurbished the main engine piece by piece, with the first official startup as a museum ship occurring in 1980. Afterward Arthur Foss regularly cruised Puget Sound waters during the summer months with a volunteer crew, participating in tugboat races, boat shows, and other maritime heritage events until 2001. The tug's excursions ended that year due to rising fuel and insurance costs, and increased safety concerns, in the wake of the 11 September attacks. Volunteer crew burnout, lack of organizational development, and the increasing need for major restoration work also played a part. Varying non-professional attempts at spot repairs over the years were superseded beginning in 2004 with larger but specifically focused restoration projects run by contracted professionals. However, a comprehensive restoration has not yet been attempted. Following extensive survey, documentation, and hull maintenance projects in 2017, planning and fundraising efforts are under way to restore the vessel to its 1940 appearance, in cruising condition. Arthur Foss was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a Seattle Landmark. The tug was also named a Washington State Centennial Heritage Flagship in 1989, when both tug and state celebrated their 100th \\"birthday\\".and Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for T , Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle.

A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In other usage, \\"dashboard\\" is another name for \\"progress report\\" or \\"report\\" and considered a form of data visualization. The ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù is often accessible by a web browser and is usually linked to regularly updating data sources. Well known dashboards include Google Analytics dashboards, used on 55% of all websites, which show activity on a website; such as visits, entry pages, bounce rate and traffic sources. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 brought other dashboards to the fore, with the John Hopkins coronavirus tracker and the UK government coronavirus tracker being good examples. The term dashboard originates from the automobile dashboard where drivers monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster. Benefits Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. In addition they enable ‚Äúrolling up‚Äù of information to present a consolidated view across an organisation. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a \\"snapshot\\" of performance. Benefits of using digital dashboards include: *Visual presentation of performance measures *Ability to identify and correct negative trends *Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies *Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends *Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected business intelligence *Align strategies and organizational goals *Saves time compared to running multiple reports *Gain total visibility of all systems instantly *Quick identification of data outliers and correlations *Consolidated reporting into one location *Available on mobile devices to quickly access metrics Classification Dashboards can be broken down according to role and are either strategic, analytical, operational, or informational.Stephen Few, Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data (O'Reilly, 2006) Dashboards are the 3rd step on the information ladder, demonstrating the conversion of data to increasingly valuable insights. Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice. Types of dashboards Digital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then drill down into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives. Three main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: desktop software applications, web- browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as desktop widgets. The last are driven by a widget engine. Desktop software providers include Tableau, Microsoft Power BI and Qlik. Web browser providers include Looker and Webtrekk. Both Desktop and Browser based providers enable the distribution of dashboards via a web browser. Specialized dashboards may track all corporate functions. Examples include human resources, recruiting, sales, operations, security, information technology, project management, customer relationship management, digital marketing and many more departmental dashboards. For a smaller organization like a startup a compact startup scorecard dashboard tracks important activities across lot of domains ranging from social media to sales. Digital dashboard projects involve business units as the driver and the information technology department as the enabler. The success of dashboard projects depends on the relevancy / importance of information provided within the dashboard. This includes the metrics chosen to monitor and the timeliness of the data forming those metrics; data has to be up to date and accurate. Key performance indicators, balanced scorecards, and sales performance figures are some of the content appropriate on business dashboards.  Business dashboard examples  * Manufacturing: a dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. * Human Resources: a dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment. * Sales ‚Äì a dashboard can show the sales made by individuals / teams / products and how they are comparing against sales targets and sales from a prior period for comparison purposes * Customer relationship management ‚Äì a dashboard can show the frequency of interactions with clients & prospects and highlight where contact may be overdue * Digital marketing ‚Äì a dashboard can show the performance of a website and also the effectiveness of email campaigns, combining with finance data to give a more accurate view of the ROI Dashboards and scorecards Balanced Scorecards and Dashboards have been linked together as if they were interchangeable. However, although both visually display critical information, the difference is in the format: Scorecards can open the quality of an operation while dashboards provide calculated direction. A balanced scorecard has what they called a \\"prescriptive\\" format. It should always contain these components: *Perspectives ‚Äì group *Objectives ‚Äì verb-noun phrases pulled from a strategy plan *Measures ‚Äì also called Metric or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) *Spotlight Indicators ‚Äì red, yellow, or green symbols that provide an at-a- glance view of a measure's performance. Each of these sections ensures that a Balanced Scorecard is essentially connected to the businesses critical strategic needs. The design of a dashboard is more loosely defined. Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted. Even when there is a strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards. However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.ZSL Inc., Dashboards Vs Scorecards ‚Äì An Insight ZSL Inc. (2006) Design Digital dashboard technology is available \\"out-of-the-box\\" from many software providers. Some companies however continue to do in-house development and maintenance of dashboard applications. For example, GE Aviation has developed a proprietary software/portal called \\"Digital Cockpit\\" to monitor the trends in aircraft spare parts business. Good dashboard design practices take into account and address the following: * the medium it is designed for (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet) * use of visuals over tabular presentation of data * bar charts: to visualize one or more series of data * line charts: to track changes in a number of dependent data sets over a period of time * sparklines: to show the trend in a single data set * scorecards: to monitor KPIs and trends * use of legends anytime more than one color or shape is present on a graph * spatial arrangement: place your most important view on the top left (if the language is written left to right) then arrange the following views in a Z pattern with the most important information following the top-to-bottom, left-to-right pattern * use colorblind friendly palettes with color used consistently and only where necessary A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible.Stacey Barr, 7 Small Business Dashboard Design Dos and Don'ts (Barr, 2010) Assessing the quality of dashboards There are a few key elements to a good dashboard:.Victoria Hetherington, Dashboard Demystified: What is a Dashboard? (Hetherington, 2009) # Simple, communicates easily # Minimum distractions...it could cause confusion # Supports organized business with meaning and useful data # Applies human visual perception to visual presentation of information # It can be accessed easily by its intended audience History The idea of digital dashboards followed the study of decision support systems in the 1970s. Early predecessors of the modern business dashboard were first developed in the 1980s in the form of Executive Information Systems (EISs). Due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling, it was soon realized that the approach wasn't practical as information was often incomplete, unreliable, and spread across too many disparate sources. Thus, EISs hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing, and online analytical processing (OLAP) allowed dashboards to function adequately. Despite the availability of enabling technologies, the dashboard use didn't become popular until later in that decade, with the rise of key performance indicators (KPIs), and the introduction of Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's Balanced Scorecard.Wayne W. Eckerson, Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business (Wiley , 2010) In the late 1990s, Microsoft promoted a concept known as the Digital Nervous System and \\"digital dashboards\\" were described as being one leg of that concept. Today, the use of dashboards forms an important part of Business Performance Management (BPM). Dashboard (web administration) A dashboard, in website administration, is typically the index page of the control panel for a website's content management system. Examples include the popular blogging software WordPress, and in the project management website Basecamp. A dashboard typically indicates items which require urgent actions at the top of the page, moving into less important statistics at the bottom. Dashboard is a design to show important data in more enhanced way.

Various paranormal research organizations, intent on capturing the paranormal activities at Goodleberg paraded carloads of investigators from neighboring counties, intent on capturing evidence of the paranormal. To date, there has been one death, which in part was blamed on the founder of a Western New York paranormal investigation team known as Paranormal and Ghost Society.

The lady in white is supposedly one of the patients who passed on and still roams the area. The Lady in White can be seen up the road and other areas surrounding the cemetery. Another myth is that a normal seeming person in his 20s will appear. He will do whatever it takes to get you to leave the surrounding areas. He had been described as having curly hair and wearing camouflage. If touched, it is said that he will disappear instantly. This is the spirit of a young Albert Speaker trying to protect what is his.

After playing college football for Texas Christian University, he was taken by the Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 1995 NFL Draft. He was elected to the Pro Bowl in 2002. He was the leader of the Raiders offensive line that led them to Super Bowl XXXVII. Professional career After playing college football for Texas Christian University, Robbins was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 1995 NFL Draft, with the 49th overall pick. In 1996, Mike White's last year as head coach, the second-year Robbins replaced Dan Turk in the lineup, becoming only the fifth starting center in Raider history, after Turk, Don Mosebar, Dave Dalby, and Jim Otto. The first sign of his mental health problems turned up during the season when he was found disoriented and wandering around the team hotel in Denver shortly before a match with the Denver Broncos. Robbins missed that game and was hospitalized.https://www.si.com/nfl/2015/12/16/untold-super- bowl-barret-robbins-raiders During the 2000 NFL season with Jon Gruden as head coach and Rich Gannon at quarterback, Oakland scored 479 points (29.9 points/game), 3rd of 31 teams in the NFL, thanks to a strong offensive line which included Robbins playing between Steve Wisniewski at left guard and Mo Collins at right guard in all 16 games (also both playoff games), finishing with a won-lost record of 12‚Äì4 and an AFC West title. In the divisional round of the 2000‚Äì01 NFL playoffs, Oakland shut out the Miami Dolphins 27‚Äì0, gaining 140 yards on the ground. An early sign of Robbins' future trouble was displayed when he went missing a week before the AFC championship game, though in this case he did show up 24 hours before the game started and played in the Raiders 16‚Äì3 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. During the 2001 NFL season, Robbins was injured, playing in only 2 regular season games, replaced by Adam Treu (also in both playoff games), when Oakland scored 399 points (24.9 points/game), 4th of 31 teams in the NFL, and won the AFC west again with a 10‚Äì6 record, defeating the New York Jets in a wildcard game but losing to the New England Patriots in the divisional round, in controversial fashion (see Tuck Rule Game). In the 2002 NFL season with Bill Callahan in his first year as head coach, Robbins rebounded strongly by starting all 16 regular season games and making the Pro Bowl. Oakland won the AFC west for the third straight year, with an 11‚Äì5 record, scoring 450 points (28.1 points/game), 2nd of 32 teams in the NFL. In the 2002‚Äì03 NFL playoffs, the Raiders defeated the New York Jets again with 399 total yards, with an offensive line composed of Robbins, Frank Middleton and Mo Collins at guard, Barry Sims and Lincoln Kennedy at tackle. The Raiders then beat with the same offensive line the Tennessee Titans in the AFC championship game, gaining 375 total yards. Then, inexplicably, the day before Super Bowl XXXVII, Robbins was reported as missing for most of the day before the game after not taking his depression medication. When he resurfaced that night, he was so incoherent that he didn't even know where he was. According to one of his teammates, Robbins didn't even recognize Callahan. Despite this, Al Davis still wanted Robbins in the game, and development coach Willie Brown had Robbins running sprints in the parking lot on the morning of the game to see if he could still play. Callahan had initially intended to let Robbins play, but not start. However, he ultimately decided to suspend Robbins for the game after concluding that he was not fit to take the field at all. He initially wanted to fly Robbins back to Oakland, but was unable to get him a plane ticket because he was missing his wallet and identification. He spent 30 days at the Betty Ford Center, during which time he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (or manic-depressive disorder). He'd been diagnosed with depression while at TCU, but it is common for the two to be confused in the early stages. It turned out that he had gone into a manic episode after not taking his medication. According to his wife, Robbins spent most of the day before the Super Bowl partying across the border in Tijuana, Mexico; he had thought the Raiders already won the game and he was celebrating their \\"victory.\\"Knapp, Gwen. 6 years later, Robbins still finding his way. San Francisco Chronicle, 2009-01-31. With Adam Treu as the starting center, the Raiders were blown out in an ugly loss in the Super Bowl to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 48‚Äì21. Robbins regained his starting job the next year in the 2003 NFL season with the same linemates, a disastrous 4‚Äì12 for the team. However, his name and those of several of his teammates were found on the list of clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative that had given performance- enhancing drugs to Marion Jones and others. The Raiders released him in the summer of 2004 after he tested positive for \\"the clear,\\" a steroid known to have come from the BALCO lab. Treu replaced him as the starting center. Post-football troubles A few months later, on Christmas Eve, he was arrested for punching a security guard who tried to keep him from going to a bar at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco. On January 15, 2005, Robbins was shot three times during a brawl with police in Miami Beach, and was subsequently charged with attempted murder for his role. Under a plea agreement, Robbins pleaded guilty to five charges, including the attempted murder charge, and was sentenced to five years' probation, ordered to receive treatment for his bipolar disorder, and to avoid alcohol. He has spent most of the last decade in jail or in rehab facilities due to problems with substance abuse. He ultimately ended up in a rehab facility in Houston in 2008, and was transferred to a halfway house in May 2009.ESPN.com: Robbins says he's looking to his future In a 2009 interview with HBO's Real Sports, Robbins told Andrea Kremer that before being diagnosed as bipolar, he had dealt with his mood swings by taking alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and steroids. He also said that he had been in a manic mood for both Raider playoff games prior to the Super Bowl. His ex-wife, Marisa, also interviewed for the story, said that before the diagnosis there were days where he had breakfast and went right back to bed.Gay, Nancy.

He was born in Virden, Illinois in 1914. He received his bachelor of science degree in 1935, his master's in 1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign.  Personal life  Warren Ambrose was a food and wine connoisseur, and also a fan of jazz saxophone player, Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker. He is noted for his work with MIT colleague, Isadore Singer, both of whom helped to shape the pure mathematics department at MIT. He retired from teaching at MIT in 1985, thereafter moving to France. Ambrose died in 1995 in Paris. He is survived by his wife, Jeannette (Grillet) Ambrose of Paris, two children from an earlier marriage, Adam Ambrose of Bisbee, AZ, and Ellen Ambrose of Laurel, MD, and four grandchildren, David and Adam Holzsager, Ari Ambrose, and Jennifer Laurent.  Career  Ambrose became an assistant professor at MIT in 1947, an associate professor in 1950 and full professor in 1957. He was several times between 1939 and 1959 a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Ambrose is often considered one of the fathers of modern geometry. He is noted for making changes in the pure mathematics undergraduate curriculum at MIT to reflect recent findings in differential geometry. For example, less than ten years after Andr√© Weil presented the differential form, Ambrose was using it in his undergraduate differential geometry courses. In the 1950s, Ambrose (together with I. M. Singer) made MIT into the only center in geometry in the United States outside the University of Chicago. His influence continued through his students, in particular Hung- Hsi Wu and John Rhodes, both of the University of California, Berkeley. In the 1960s Ambrose was a visiting professor at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is noted for his opposition of takeover of South American countries military regimes, specifically Argentina.  Political activism  In the summer of 1966, while a visiting professor at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, Ambrose was severely beaten along with Argentinian faculty members and students by Argentinian military police. This occurred shortly after a military regime took over public universities in Argentina. Ambrose responded by bringing several of the best and brightest students from the University of Buenos Aires back to MIT with him. Ambrose is often renowned amongst Latin American intellectuals for bringing attention to right-wing dictatorships in South America. In 1967, Ambrose signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.\\"An Open Letter\\" archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive ReferencesExternal links * Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:American tax resisters Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:1914 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Virden, Illinois Category:Geometers Category:Mathematicians from Illinois ","title":"Warren Ambrose"},{"id":"4166619","text":"Namhae Chemical Corporation is a large South Korean company which produces fertilizers and chemicals.

Early life Alsop was born and raised in Avon, Connecticut, from an old Yankee family. Alsop attended Groton School and Yale University. His parents were Joseph Wright Alsop IV (1876‚Äì1953) and Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886‚Äì1971). Through his mother, he was a grandnephew of Theodore Roosevelt. Early career After graduating from Yale in 1936, Alsop moved to New York City, where he worked as an editor for the publishing house of Doubleday, Doran.Merry, Robert W. Taking on the World : Joseph and Stewart Alsop‚ÄîGuardians of the American Century. New York: Viking, 1996. 70. World War II After the United States entered World War II, Alsop joined the British Army because his high blood pressure precluded his joining the US Army.Merry, 105. On June 20, 1944, Alsop married Patricia Barnard \\"Tish\\" Hankey (1926-2012), an Englishwoman. A month after the wedding, Alsop was allowed to transfer to the US Army, and he was immediately sent on a mission planned by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). For the mission, Alsop was parachuted into the P√©rigord region of France to aid the French Resistance. Alsop was later awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm for his work on that and other wartime missions.Merry, 118‚Äì120. Alsop worked with and for the OSS for the rest of the war. Journalism From 1945 to 1958, Stewart Alsop was co-writer, with his brother Joseph, of the thrice-weekly \\"Matter of Fact\\" column for the New York Herald Tribune. Stewart usually stayed in Washington and covered domestic politics, and Joseph traveled the world to cover foreign affairs. In 1958, the Alsops described themselves as \\"Republicans by inheritance and registration, and... conservatives by political conviction.\\"Alsop, Joseph and Stewart Alsop. The Reporter's Trade. New York: Reynal & Company, 1958. Foreword. After the Alsop brothers ended their partnership, Stewart went on to write articles and a regular column for the Saturday Evening Post until 1968 and then a weekly column for Newsweek from 1968 to 1974. He published several books, including a \\"sort of memoir\\" of his battle with an unusual form of leukemia, Stay of Execution. He wrote, \\"A dying man wants to die like a sleepy man wants to sleep.\\" At the end of his battle with cancer, he requested that he be given something other than morphine to numb the pain because he was tired of its sedative effect. His doctor suggested heroin. Family On June 20, 1944, Alsop married Patricia Barnard \\"Tish\\" Hankey (1926-2012), whom he met while training in England, where she lived.Merry, 118. Together, they had six children: Joseph Wright VI; Ian; Elizabeth Winthrop, a children's book author; Stewart II, an investor and pundit; Richard Nicholas, a missionary with FamilyLife; and Andrew Alsop. Legacy Alsop is interred at the Indian Hill Cemetery in Middletown, Connecticut. In Alsop's hometown of Avon, Connecticut, there is a public park that is named Alsop Meadows in his honor.

In prayer, it refers to the bowing at the waist from standing (qiyƒÅm) on the completion of recitation (qira æat) of a portion of the Qur'an in Islamic formal prayers (salah). There is a consensus on the obligatory nature of the ruk≈´ ø. The position of ruk≈´ ø is established by bending over till the hands are on the knees and remaining in that position until one attains a relaxed state while glorifying God ( sub·∏•ƒÅna rabbiya l- øa·∫ìƒ´m, \\"Glory be to my Lord, the Most Magnificent!\\") thrice or more in odd number of times. In Al-Ghazali's book Inner Dimensions of Islamic Worship, he wrote about the ruk≈´ ø by saying:Abu Hamid Muhammad Al-Ghazali. \\"Inner Dimensions of Islamic Worship \\" Sunnipath.com. taken from his Ihya Ulum al-Din :Bowing (ruk≈´ ø) and prostration (suj≈´d) are accompanied by a renewed affirmation of the supreme greatness of Allah. In bowing you renew your submissiveness and humility, striving to refine your inner feeling through a fresh awareness of your own importance and insignificance before the might and grandeur of your Lord. To confirm this, you seek the aid of your tongue, glorifying your Lord and testifying repeatedly to His supreme majesty, both inwardly and outwardly. Muslims in ruk≈´ ø :Then you rise from bowing, hopeful that He will be merciful towards you. To emphasise this hope within you, you say sami øa -llƒÅhu liman ·∏•amidah (, \\"God heeds to those who gratefully praises Him\\"). Acknowledging the need to express gratitude, you immediately add, rabbanƒÅ laka l-·∏•amd (, \\"grateful praise to You, our Lord!\\") To show the abundance of this gratitude, you may also say mal æa s-samƒÅwƒÅti wa-mal æa l- æar·∏ç (, \\"as much as the heavens and the earth contain\\"). Qur'anic subdivision The term ruk≈´ ø ‚Äî roughly translated to \\"passage\\", \\"pericope\\" or \\"stanza\\" ‚Äî is also used to denote a group of thematically related verses in the Quran. Longer chapters (surah) in the Qur'an are usually divided into several ruk≈´ øs, so that the reciters could identify when to make ruku in Salah without breaking an ongoing topic in the Quranic text. There are 558 ruk≈´ øs in the Qur'an. In some books, 540 have been mentioned which is actually misunderstood by some people with total rukus of quran recited in Tarawih prayer (special prayer in the Islamic month of Ramadan after the night prayer). This subdivision is not part of original revelation but adopted later-on to facilitate completion of Quran on the 27th night of Ramadan (i.e. on Laylatul Qadr) if one ruku is recited in each rakat of taraweeh prayers (20 x 27 = 540).

The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the 1990 Mid Staffordshire by-electionStaffordshire Mid 1990 and the 1991 Ribble Valley by-election, where they finished behind the OMRLP,Ribble Valley 1991 and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991Byron Criddle and Robert Waller, Almanac of British Politics (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councillor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the OMRLP ‚Äì the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \\"Loony\\" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. The party became effectively defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the OMRLP. It has not stood any candidates for a number of years and is not registered with the Electoral Commission.

The company was acquired by Computer Associates International in 2000 in a stock-for-stock transaction worth $3.3 billion. Computer Associates sold Sterling Software's Federal Systems Group to Northrop Grumman in 2000. It was known for its aggressive acquisitions, most notably the hostile take-over of Informatics General Corporation in 1985. Informatics was one of the first established software and services companies. It developed the MARK-IV Fourth-generation programming language in the 1960s. MARK-IV became the first software package exceeding $1 million in revenue, after IBM was forced in 1969 to unbundle software from their hardware. Helped by financing and counseled by Werner Frank, one of Informatics' founders who had left this company a year before, Sterling Software started the hostile take over by offering to shareholders an interesting price per share and increasing it slowly until the Informatics board was no longer able to reject it. Overnight, Sterling Software became a $200 million in revenue company up from $20 million. After only 2 years, they started again acquiring new companies. Acquired Reston, VA-based Systems Center, Inc. in 1993 in a stock-for stock transaction worth $185 million, Sterling Software's 20th acquisition. In the process of this acquisition, Sterling Software was completely restructured along lines of business, as opposed to the previous practice of absorbing acquired companies as essentially equivalent divisions. Acquired Atlanta-based KnowledgeWare in a stock-for-stock transaction worth $74 million in 1994, in the process eliminating about 250 jobs in the combined companies. KnowledgeWare's founder Fran Tarkenton joined the Sterling Software board of directors as part of the deal. Acquired Texas Instruments's Dallas-based software division (known as TI Software) for $165 million cash in 1997, about 66% of its previous year's revenue. The acquisition included the rights to CA Gen. Acquired Boston-based Cayenne Software for $11.4 million in cash in 1998, Sterling Software's 30th acquisition. Acquired Fremont, California-based Interlink Computer Sciences in 1999 for $64 million in cash, merging Interlink into Sterling's existing Network Management Division.

Origin The family was founded in Venezuela, by Carlos Francisco de Sucre Garrido y Pardo, a Flanders-born noble, son of Charles Adrien de Sucre y d'Yves, Marquess of Preux, of Flemish origin, and of Mar√≠a Buenaventura Carolina Isabel Garrido de S√°nchez y Pardo de Figueroa, Lady of Syssele, of Spanish origin. Carlos Francisco de Sucre Garrido y Pardo, served as a soldier of Catalunya to the Spanish Crown in 1689, and was later named Governor of Cartagena de Indias and Governor and Captain General of Cuba. On 22 December 1779, the family arrived in Venezuela as Sucre Garrido y Pardo was appointed Governor of New Andalucia, the easternmost province of the then Captaincy General of Venezuela and where the family would remain for almost all its history. He married Margarita de Flores y Trelles and had a son Antonio Mauricio de Sucre Pardo y Trelles, married to Josefa Margarita Francisca Garc√≠a de Urbaneja y S√°nchez de Torres, daughter of Francisco Manuel Garc√≠a de Urbaneja y Andrade and wife Teresa S√°nchez de Torres y Gobea. Their son Vicente de Sucre y Garc√≠a de Urbaneja married Mar√≠a Manuela de Alcal√° y S√°nchez Ram√≠rez de Arellano, daughter of Pedro de Alcal√° y Rend√≥n and wife Juana Jer√≥nima S√°nchez Ram√≠rez de Arellano y Vallenilla, and their son was Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Sucre y Alcal√°. Antonio Jos√© de Sucre Members of this family have excelled in modern Venezuelan history and have had a deep impact in that country's events. The most well-known member is General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. He was a prominent figure in the Spanish American independence movement against Spain and is considered a founder of Bolivia, the liberator of Ecuador, and the Grand Marshal of Ayacucho. During the Spanish regime, he was originally appointed as a lieutenant in the provincial armed forces of the Venezuelan republics, serving under General Santiago Marino. Sucre later became the first lieutenant to the liberator Simon Bolivar and was widely touted to replace Bolivar as the leader of the newly independent Latin American nations before his untimely death in the hands of royalist rebels in 1830. While Bolivar is described as the charismatic leader who rallied the independence forces to fight, historians recognize Sucre as the military genius behind him. Under Bolivar, he was involved in the purchase of armaments, issuing military orders, recruitment, and personnel assignments. Sucre also run a spy network against the royalists until they retreated into the highlands southwest of Lima. Sucre is particularly famous for the Battle of Pichincha in 1822, where he quashed the Spaniards and liberated Ecuador. There is also the case of the Battle of Ayacucho, where he triumphed over Royalist army despite being vastly outnumbered. His forces sustained 309 dead and 607 wounded to the Royalists' 1,400 dead and 700 wounded. His ability as a statesman was tested when he engaged in diplomatic missions, negotiating the armistice with Spain particularly in 1820. Recent history In the 20th century the family has once again become prominent in Venezuelan life as its members have taken roles in literature, politics, military and business. During the 1960s and 1970s the Sucre Figarella brothers were almost all involved in Venezuelan life serving in areas such as the military, public infrastructure, legislature, foreign service and literature. The oldest brother Juan Manuel Sucre was a general and served as Commander in Chief of the Army; his younger brother Leopoldo had the most active participation in politics as he was Governor and Senator of the state of Bolivar, Minister of Public Works, and as President of the state-owned Corporaci√≥n Venezolana de Guayana; the third brother Jose Francisco was a key member of the foreign policy community serving as Ambassador to the United Nations and a number of European countries such as Russia and Austria. During the early half of the 20th century, another member of the family, Jos√© Antonio Ramos Sucre, had achieved fame as a great poet. Nowadays, members of the family are mostly involved in private businesses.

These agreements later served as the basis for the Non- Importation Act, and subsequent Embargo of 1807 that was passed by the United States Congress in 1806 in an attempt to establish American nautical neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars between France and Britain. Throughout the 1760s, the American colonies found themselves in the midst of one of America‚Äôs early economic falls. Colonists living in this time found themselves low on money, with trade becoming increasingly difficult, and their debt to Britain growing larger. To add to the colonist's already pressing issues, Britain began to impose a host of acts against them. Paying debts In an attempt to gain some type of compensation for the colonist's debts, Britain created acts in an effort to offset expenses on their end due to activities mainly involving the protection of the colonists. Two of these were the Quartering Act and the Stamp Act. While the Quartering Act cut down on the cost of housing British soldiers, the Stamp act placed duties on any official papers or documents produced within the colonies in an attempt to create revenue with which to defray some of the colonist's debts. Taxes damage trade The Sugar Act in particular had a negative impact on imports regarding trade between the colonies and outside countries. It cut costs on importing molasses into the country by half. However, the American colonists had been evading the previous tax, and although the Sugar Act reduced duties on molasses, it came with a higher enforcement level. It also placed taxes on imports that were formerly not taxed and put Britain‚Äôs hand in important American exports such as lumber. Colonist resistance The taxation and legislation passed by the British upset the colonists. American patriotism became strong and the colonists decided to confront the situation. In an attempt to resist the Stamp Act, the Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty were born. Large portions of the protests were marked by riots, the burning of ‚Äústamped‚Äù papers and the tarring and feathering of British officials as well as those continuing to use British goods. American and homemade goods became the patriotic choice for consumers. Another notable act that led to violent opposition was the passing of the Tea Act. This act enraged the already volatile colonists and resulted in a group of people living in Boston enacting the infamous Boston Tea Party, where in three ships worth of tea barrels were dumped into the Boston Harbor. Britain's reaction In reaction to the colonists' actions regarding the Boston Tea Party, Britain decided to pass what were known as the Intolerable Acts. These acts were aimed at bringing the colonies back into compliance with the King‚Äôs wishes and included the outlawing of town meetings. Once again, the colonists were outraged. In response, twelve of the thirteen colonies formed the First Continental Congress, where they drafted a list of grievances against the crown and the provisions they would make until legislature was changed. One of these provisions were the non-consumption agreements, which stated that unless Britain repealed their previously passed acts, then the colonies would engage in neither the import of British goods nor export goods to Britain and its colonies. Split in the Colonies It is important to note, however, that the colonists were not wholly supportive of refusing to consume British goods. This was especially the case with many merchants whose stores were stocked full of British goods and feared the shock that their income would surely incur. The southern colonies were also a large group that was wary of the effect that refusing trade with Britain would bring, as they were more heavily involved in producing the goods, such as cotton, that England consumed more heavily than were the northern colonies.

In a case where both central and state law exist, central laws will be given priority over state laws through the doctrine of supremacy. This is usually applied in cases of post-colonial indirect rule.  Historical systems  In feudalism, paramountcy is a matter of suzerainty, generally vested in a sovereign monarch, as the summit of a vassalic pyramid of subject entities. Thus the Mughal Badshah (emperor) was the overlord, directly or indirectly, of many native princely states in pre-colonial India. In the colonial age and system, paramountcy could similarly be vested in (the crown) of the colonizing imperial power, insofar as it practices indirect rule over native rulers, but could also be delegated to chartered company. Thus the British paramountcy in British India over its princely states (first by the chartered British East India Company, later by the Colonial Office of the British imperial government) replaced or imitated the Mughal overlordship over a similar, growing list of native states, while some would be annexed. Similarly, the Dutch (first the Dutch East India Company, later the government) assumed suzerain paramountcy over the native rulers in the Dutch East Indies. In India, the princely state accepted the supremacy of British Raj but the East India company granted a certain amount of freedom in conducting their internal matters this is called paramountcy or suzerainty.

Since each coefficient w, x, y, z spans two real dimensions, the split-biquaternion is an element of an eight- dimensional vector space. Considering that it carries a multiplication, this vector space is an algebra over the real field, or an algebra over a ring where the split-complex numbers form the ring. This algebra was introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in an 1873 article for the London Mathematical Society. It has been repeatedly noted in mathematical literature since then, variously as a deviation in terminology, an illustration of the tensor product of algebras, and as an illustration of the direct sum of algebras. The split- biquaternions have been identified in various ways by algebraists; see below. Modern definition A split-biquaternion is ring isomorphic to the Clifford algebra C‚Ñì0,3(R). This is the geometric algebra generated by three orthogonal imaginary unit basis directions, } under the combination rule ::e_i e_j = \\\\Bigg{ \\\\begin{matrix} -1 & i=j, \\\\ \\\\- e_j e_i & i ot = j \\\\end{matrix} giving an algebra spanned by the 8 basis elements with (e1e2)2 = (e2e3)2 = (e3e1)2 = ‚àí1 and œâ2 = (e1e2e3)2 = +1. The sub-algebra spanned by the 4 elements } is the division ring of Hamilton's quaternions, . One can therefore see that :C\\\\ell_{0,3}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{D} where is the algebra spanned by the algebra of the split-complex numbers. Equivalently, :C\\\\ell_{0,3}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H}. Split- biquaternion group The split-biquaternions form an associative ring as is clear from considering multiplications in its basis {1, œâ, i, j, k, œâi, œâj, œâk}. When œâ is adjoined to the quaternion group one obtains a 16 element group :( {1, i, j, k, ‚àí1, ‚àíi, ‚àíj, ‚àík, œâ, œâi, œâj, œâk, ‚àíœâ, ‚àíœâi, ‚àíœâj, ‚àíœâk}, √ó ). Direct sum of two quaternion rings The direct sum of the division ring of quaternions with itself is denoted \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H}. The product of two elements (a \\\\oplus b) and (c \\\\oplus d) is a c \\\\oplus b d in this direct sum algebra. Proposition: The algebra of split-biquaternions is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H}. proof: Every split-biquaternion has an expression q = w + z œâ where w and z are quaternions and œâ2 = +1. Now if p = u + v œâ is another split-biquaternion, their product is : pq = uw + vz + (uz + vw) \\\\omega .! The isomorphism mapping from split-biquaternions to \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H} is given by :p \\\\mapsto (u + v) \\\\oplus (u - v) , \\\\quad q \\\\mapsto (w + z) \\\\oplus (w - z). In \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H}, the product of these images, according to the algebra-product of \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H} indicated above, is :(u + v)(w + z) \\\\oplus (u - v)(w - z). This element is also the image of pq under the mapping into \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{H}. Thus the products agree, the mapping is a homomorphism; and since it is bijective, it is an isomorphism. Though split-biquaternions form an eight-dimensional space like Hamilton's biquaternions, on the basis of the Proposition it is apparent that this algebra splits into the direct sum of two copies of the real quaternions.  Hamilton biquaternion  The split- biquaternions should not be confused with the (ordinary) biquaternions previously introduced by William Rowan Hamilton. Hamilton's biquaternions are elements of the algebra :C\\\\ell_2(\\\\mathbb{C}) = \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{C}.

The New Philadelphia Town Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009. In the late 20th century, a local history group recruited archaeologists to explore the long-abandoned town site. Teams from the University of Maryland, College Park, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and De Paul University have worked for years on research and excavations, collected data about residents from census and land records, and turned up thousands of artifacts. In addition they have trained students at summer field schools, and published reports, articles, and books on the history of McWorter, his family and his town. McWorter descendants donated the collected 11 volumes of documentation to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in February 2008. In addition the family donated a bronze bust of Frank McWorter by his great-great- granddaughter Shirley McWorter Moss. Biography Frank McWorter was born in 1777 into slavery in South Carolina to Juda, born in West Africa, abducted into slavery and transported to the colony. His father was likely her white master, George McWhorter, a Scots-Irish planter. According to family tradition, Juda had to convince McWhorter to allow his mixed-race son to live. In 1795 McWhorter moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky and took Frank to build and later manage his holdings there. Frank tended the farm, but McWhorter also leased him to work for neighbors as a laborer. From being hired out, Frank learned business skills and earned more money than his master required him to hand over. After McWhorter moved to Tennessee, he continued to have Frank manage his farm in Kentucky. Frank used his savings to create a saltpeter production operation, for which there was considerable demand during the War of 1812. Marriage and family In 1799 Frank married Lucy, an enslaved African American on a neighboring plantation. They had thirteen children born into slavery, of which four, Juda, Frank, Sally, and Solomon survived. By 1817 Frank had earned enough money to buy Lucy from her master for $800. She was pregnant at the time with their son Squire, and he was (later) freeborn. Two years after that, in 1819, Frank bought his own freedom at the same price. He then called himself Free Frank, which served notice that he was legally free, and that it was known to townspeople that he was free. (It was not uncommon for free black citizens to be kidnapped and enslaved.) In 1829 Free Frank traded his saltpeter plant in exchange for the freedom of his son Frank, who had fled to Canada and was a fugitive. (This allowed his son to return to the United States as a free man.) By this time he and Lucy also had three surviving freeborn children: Squire, Commodore and Lucy Ann.\\"New Philadelphia: A Multiracial Town on the Illinois Frontier\\", Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan, National Park Service.Christopher Fennell, \\"Historical Landscapes of New Philadelphia, Illinois\\", University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, accessed July 23, 2010. 'Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier.' Juliet E. K. Walker. 1983, The University Press of Kentucky. Move to Illinois In 1830 Frank, Lucy and their four free children moved to Pike County, Illinois. By the second year they started farming. In 1836 Frank filed a plat to create the village of New Philadelphia on which he had purchased from the federal government for $100. The town site, which was divided into 144 lots, was registered with government authorities in 1836. McWorter established residence in New Philadelphia with his family and sold other lots to new residents. Both blacks and whites settled there and supported an integrated school. It was the crossroads of an agricultural community and, when founded, proposed as being on the route of a planned Illinois-Michigan canal (which was never built.) In 1837, Free Frank petitioned the Illinois legislature (as was required) so that he could officially take the surname McWorter.\\"Free Frank McWorter\\", Teaching with Historic Places, National Park Service In that same year, the legislation was passed to \\"make 'Frank McWorter' his legal name.\\" This technicality enabled him to have certain rights normally reserved for white men in Illinois. He could bring lawsuits to court, and could legally marry his wife of over 40 years. But, he still could not vote.\\"Goebel-Bain, Angela, 2009, \\"From Humble Beginnings: Lincoln's Illinois 1830-1861,\\" The Living Museum 71 (1&2): 5-25; quotation on page 9. McWorter was the first black man in the United States to incorporate a municipality. He served as mayor of New Philadelphia, which was soon settled by African Americans and European Americans, for years. McWorter lived most of the rest of his life in western Illinois, with intervals in Kentucky before the American Civil War to buy freedom for his three grown children and grandchildren left in Kentucky. For instance, in 1835 he returned and purchased the freedom of his son Solomon. On each trip he risked capture by unscrupulous slave traders, despite his legally free status. McWorter died on September 7, 1854; by that time he had bought the freedom of eight more of his relatives. Through his work, he gained freedom for 16 members of his family. His heirs used his inheritance to free seven more relatives. Town's decline In 1869 the first railroad was built through Pike County, bypassing New Philadelphia to the north for Baylis, which had a train station. Businesses moved there for better access. The population of New Philadelphia rapidly declined. By the end of the nineteenth century, some of the townsite had been reverted to farmland for cultivation, but other areas were inhabited through the 1920s.

Jim produced over of diphtheria antitoxin in his career. However, on October 2, 1901, Jim showed signs that he had contracted tetanus and was euthanized. After the death of a girl in St. Louis was traced back to Jim's contaminated serum, it was discovered that serum dated September 30 contained tetanus in its incubation phase. This contamination could have easily been discovered if the serum had been tested prior to its use. Furthermore, samples from September 30 had also been used to fill bottles labeled \\"August 24,\\" while actual samples from the 24th were shown to be free of contamination. These failures in oversight led to the distribution of antitoxin that caused the death of 12 more children. This incident, and a similar one involving contaminated smallpox vaccine, led to the passage of the Biologics Control Act of 1902, which established the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Jim's misfortune, and the ensuing tragedy and reaction, thus established a precedent for the regulation of biologics, leading to the 1906 formation of the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.

Unlike interjurisdictional immunity, which is concerned with the scope of the federal power, paramountcy deals with the way in which that power is exercised. Nature of the doctrine Paramountcy is relevant where there is conflicting federal and provincial legislation. As Major J explained in Rothmans: Claims in paramountcy may arise from two different forms of conflict:COPA, par. 64 :* Operational conflict between federal and provincial laws, such that dual compliance is impossible. :* Where dual compliance is possible, but the provincial law is incompatible with the purpose of federal legislation, thus frustrating a federal purpose. To determine whether the impugned legislation frustrates a federal purpose, it is necessary to consider the regulatory framework that governs the matter in question. The party seeking to invoke the doctrine of federal paramountcy bears the burden of proof. History=Development The doctrine was first expressed in the Local Prohibition Case, and was subsequently described by Lord Dunedin in Grand Trunk v. Attorney General of Canada thus: Historically, the doctrine was interpreted very strictly. When there was any overlap between federal or provincial laws the federal law would always render the provincial law inoperative even where there was no conflict. It was over time that courts and academics began to interpret the power as only applying where conformity to one law would necessarily violate the other. The Supreme Court of Canada adopted the latter interpretation in the decision of Smith v. The Queen. The Court held that there must be an \\"operational incompatibility\\" between the laws in order to invoke paramountcy. The modern use of the paramountcy doctrine was articulated in Multiple Access v. McCutcheon. In that case, both the provincial and federal governments had enacted virtually identical insider trading legislation. The Court found that statutory duplication does not invoke paramountcy as the court had the discretion to prevent double penalties. Instead, paramountcy can only be invoked when the compliance with one means the breach of the other. A later example of this doctrine was in the decision of Law Society of British Columbia v. Mangat, where the Court found an operational conflict between the provincial Law Society Act prohibiting non- lawyers from appearing in front of a judge and the federal Immigration Act which allowed non-lawyers to appear before the immigration tribunal. Tensions in the two-branch test The extent to which each branch of the paramountcy test can apply was explored in several cases decided by the SCC in November 2015, which have come to be known as the \\"paramountcy trilogy.\\" The majority in each of these held that: #\\"Operational conflict\\" is to be construed broadly, using a more substantive, contextual, and purposive approach, and it is not necessary to consider whether dual compliance would be impossible. #\\"Federal purpose\\" requires a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of the federal statute in order to ensure that it is properly identified. To that end, decision makers should not search high and low for it, as too broad a characterization can have the unwanted effect of improperly impairing provincial legislative authority. C√¥t√© J wrote vigorous dissents in all three cases, arguing that the majority's interpretation of the first branch conflicts with the clear standard of impossibility of dual compliance as a result of an express conflict expressed in prior jurisprudence, which was succinctly expressed in Multiple Access as \\"where one enactment says 'yes' and the other says 'no'; 'the same citizens are being told to do inconsistent things'; compliance with one is defiance of the other.\\"Multiple Access Ltd, p. 191, quoted at Moloney, par. 100. As well, the majority's interpretation of the second branch conflicts with the Court's prior ruling in Mangat, in that \\"harmonious interpretation of both federal and provincial legislation cannot lead this Court to disregard obvious purposes that are pursued in federal legislation.\\"Lemare, par. 78, drawing on Mangat, par. 66  See also  * Federal preemption and the Supremacy clause for the US context * Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia ReferencesSignificant cases     Further reading  * * Category:Constitution of Canada Category:Federalism in Canada ","title":"Paramountcy (Canada)"},{"id":"4166867","text":"The aklys (Latin aclys, Greek agkulis) was a Roman javelin measuring approximately 2 m (79 in, 6.6 ft) in length, thrown with the aid of a leather strap or amentum, similar to a Swiss arrow.

It was developed in OKB-117 led by S. P. Izotov (now OAO Klimov) from 1968 with production starting in 1981. Previous generations of Russian supersonic fighters such as the MiG-21 and MiG-23 used turbojets, but western fighters such as the F-111 and F-4K introduced the use of afterburning turbofans in the 1960s which were more efficient. The RD-33 was the first afterburning turbofan engine produced by the Klimov company of Russia in the thrust class. It features a modular twin-shaft design with individual parts that can be replaced separately.  Variants  In early 1970s the RD-33 was selected for new light fighter jet, later becoming Mikoyan MiG-29, the other option was Tumansky R-67-300. Years of development has built an extensive engine family. A newly designed thrust vectoring nozzle (TVN) is now available. New models of the RD-33 family include BARK digital monitoring and control systems. Repair and maintenance of RD-33 engines takes advantage of an information and diagnostics system (IDS). RD-33 Baseline model developed in 1976 to power the MiG-29. Development work started in 1968 at the Klimov Design Bureau, led by Sergey Isotov. The first few engines for the 9.01 MiG-29 prototype were equipped with a longer nozzle, without the double wall design, which is featured on the current RD-33 and RD-33MK models. This design had an extra controllable section after the critical cross section in the Laval type nozzle. The reason was the control of the jet blast contour at high altitude, low ambient air pressure, where the exhaust gases over expanding after the exhaust section. Right after the first few example and the first few MiG-29 prototype models, this difficult control system was removed, due to the operational altitude limit of the upcoming fighter. The first few series of the basic RD-33 version had some issue with the oil system, where a leakage caused a series of problems for the test pilots, because the oil leakage generated toxic particles in the air conditioning system. After the production line was going, these kinds of teething problems were solved. The only disadvantage was a low service life, and heavy smoke, which was fixed only in the later models. RD-33B/NB A model without afterburner for various types of aircraft, such as the Il-102. RD-93 A variant used to power the JF-17 (FC-1). According to JF-17.com http://www.jf-17.com/engine/ \\"The most significant difference being the repositioning of the gearbox along the bottom of the engine casing.\\" The Klimov poster at Zhuhai 2010 airshow gave the thrust range of the engine to be 49.4 kN to 84.4 kN Wet. https://web.archive.org/web/20180524222821/http://i56.tinypic.com/n3vu4x.jpg This was designed specifically for FC-1 with increased thrust and relocated gearbox compared to base RD-33's, although the increase of thrust decreased the service life of RD-93 to 2200 hours from RD-33's 4000 hours.

Gnosticism is an ancient name for a variety of religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish-Christian milieux in the first and second century CE. The Mandaeans are an ancient Gnostic sect still active in Iran and Iraq with small communities in other parts of the world. The late 19th century saw the publication of popular sympathetic studies making use of recently rediscovered source materials. In this period there was also the revival of a Gnostic religious movement in France. The emergence of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 greatly increased the amount of source material available. Its translation into English and other modern languages in 1977 resulted in a wide dissemination, and as a result had observable influence on several modern figures, and upon modern Western culture in general. This article attempts to summarize those modern figures and movements that have been influenced by Gnosticism, both prior and subsequent to the Nag Hammadi discovery. A number of ecclesiastical bodies that identify as Gnostic have set up or re-founded since World War II as well, including the Ecclesia Gnostica, Johannite Church, Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, the Thomasine Church (not to be confused with the St. Thomas Christians of India), the Alexandrian Gnostic Church, and the North American College of Gnostic Bishops. Late 19th century Source materials were discovered in the 18th century. In 1769 the Bruce Codex was brought to England from Upper Egypt by the Scottish traveller James Bruce, and subsequently bequeathed to the care of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Sometime prior to 1785 The Askew Codex (a.k.a. Pistis Sophia) was bought by the British Museum from the heirs of Dr. Askew. Pistis Sophia text and Latin translation of the Askew Codex by M. G. Schwartze were published in 1851. Although discovered in 1896 the Coptic Berlin Codex (a.k.a. the Akhmim Codex), was not 'rediscovered' until the 20th century. Charles William King Charles William King was a British writer and collector of ancient gemstones with magical inscriptions. His collection was sold because of his failing eyesight, and was presented in 1881 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. King was recognized as one of the greatest authorities on gems.1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In The Gnostics and their Remains (1864, 1887 2nd ed.) King sets out to show that rather than being a Western heresy, the origins of Gnosticism are to be found in the East, specifically in Buddhism. This theory was embraced by Blavatsky, who argued that it was plausible, but rejected by GRS Mead. According to Mead, King's work \\"lacks the thoroughness of the specialist.\\"Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 8-9 Madame Blavatsky Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, co-founder of the Theosophical Society, wrote extensively on Gnostic ideas. A compilation of her writings on Gnosticism is over 270 pages long.Hoeller (2002) p. 167 The first edition of King's The Gnostics and Their Remains was repeatedly cited as a source and quoted in Isis Unveiled. G. R. S. Mead G. R. S. Mead became a member of Blavatsky's Theosophical Society in 1884. He left the teaching profession in 1889 to become Blavatsky's private secretary, which he was until her death in 1891. Mead's interest in Gnosticism was likely awakened by Blavatsky who discussed it at length in Isis Unveiled.Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 8 In 1890‚Äì1891 Mead published a serial article on Pistis Sophia in Lucifer magazine, the first English translation of that work. In an article in 1891, Mead argues for the recovery of the literature and thought of the West at a time when Theosophy was largely directed to the East. Saying that this recovery of Western antique traditions is a work of interpretation and \\"the rendering of tardy justice to pagans and heretics, the reviled and rejected pioneers of progress...\\"Goodrick-Clarke (2005) pp. 56‚Äì57 This was the direction his own work was to take. The first edition of his translation of Pistis Sophia appeared in 1896. From 1896‚Äì1898 Mead published another serial article in the same periodical, \\"Among the Gnostics of the First Two Centuries,\\" that laid the foundation for his monumental compendium Fragments of a Faith Forgotten in 1900. Mead serially published translations from the Corpus Hermeticum from 1900‚Äì1905. The next year he published Thrice-Greatest Hermes a massive comprehensive three volume treatise. His series Echoes of the Gnosis was published in 12 booklets in 1908. By the time he left the Theosophical Society in 1909, he had published many influential translations, commentaries, and studies of ancient Gnostic texts. \\"Mead made Gnosticism accessible to the intelligent public outside of academia\\".Hoeller (2002) p. 170 Mead's work has had and continues to have widespread influence.Goodrick-Clarke (2005) pp. 31‚Äì32 The Gnostic Church revival in France After a series of visions and archival finds of Cathar- related documents, a librarian named Jules-Beno√Æt Stanislas Doinel du Val- Michel (a.k.a. Jules Doinel) establishes the Eglise Gnostique (French: Gnostic Church). Founded on extant Cathar documents with the Gospel of John and strong influence of Simonian and Valentinian cosmology, the church was officially established in the autumn of 1890 in Paris, France. Doinel declared it \\"the era of Gnosis restored.\\" Liturgical services were based on Cathar rituals. Clergy was both male and female, having male bishops and female \\"sophias.\\"Pearson, J. (2007) p. 47Hoeller (2002) p. 176-8 Doinel resigned and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1895, one of many duped by L√©o Taxil's anti- masonic hoax. Taxil unveiled the hoax in 1897. Doinel was readmitted to the Gnostic church as a bishop in 1900. Early to mid-20th century=Carl Jung Carl Gustav Jung evinced a special interest in Gnosticism from at least 1912, when he wrote enthusiastically about the topic in a letter to Freud. After what he called his own 'encounter with the unconscious,' Jung sought for external evidence of this kind of experience. He found such evidence in Gnosticism, and also in alchemy, which he saw as a continuation of Gnostic thought, and of which more source material was available.Segal (1995) p. 26 In his study of the Gnostics, Jung made extensive use of the work of GRS Mead. Jung visited Mead in London to thank him for the Pistis Sophia, the two corresponded, and Mead visited Jung in Z√ºrich.Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 1, 30-1 Jung saw the Gnostics not as syncretic schools of mixed theological doctrines, but as genuine visionaries, and saw their imagery not as myths but as records of inner experience.Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 30 He wrote that \\"The explanation of Gnostic ideas 'in terms of themselves,' i.e., in terms of their historical foundations, is futile, for in that way they are reduced only to their less developed forestages but not understood in their actual significance.\\"Jung (1977) p. 652 Instead, he worked to understand and explain Gnosticism from a psychological standpoint. While providing something of an ancient mirror of his work, Jung saw \\"his psychology not as a contemporary version of Gnosticism, but as a contemporary counterpart to it.\\"Segal (1995) p. 30 Jung reported a series of experiences in the winter of 1916-17 that inspired him to write Septem Sermones ad Mortuos (Latin: Seven Sermons to the Dead).Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 31Hoeller (1989) p. 7 = The Jung Codex = Through the efforts of Gilles Quispel, the Jung Codex was the first codex brought to light from the Nag Hammadi Library. It was purchased by the Jung Institute and ceremonially presented to Jung in 1953 because of his great interest in the ancient Gnostics.Jung (1977) p. 671 First publication of translations of Nag Hammadi texts in 1955 with the Jung Codex by H. Puech, Gilles Quispel, and W. Van Unnik. French Gnostic Church split, reintegration, and continuation Jean Bricaud had been involved with the Eliate Church of Carmel of , the remnants of Fabr√©-Palaprat's √âglise Johannite des Chr√©tiens Primitifs (Johannite Church of Primitive Christians), and the Martinist Order before being consecrated a bishop of the √âglise Gnostique in 1901. In 1907 Bricaud established a church body that combined all of these, becoming patriarch under the name Tau Jean II. The impetus for this was to use the Western Rite. Briefly called the √âglise Catholique Gnostique (Gnostic Catholic Church), it was renamed the √âglise Gnostique Universelle (Universal Gnostic Church, EGU) in 1908. The close ties between the church and Martinism were formalized in 1911. Bricaud received consecration in the Villate line of apostolic succession in 1919. The original church body founded by Doinel continued under the name √âglise Gnostique de France (Gnostic Church of France) until it was disbanded in favor of the EGU in 1926. The EGU continued until 1960 when it was disbanded by Robert Amberlain (Tau Jean III) in favor of the √âglise Gnostique Apostolique that he had founded in 1958.Pearson, J. (2007) p. 131 It is active in France (including Martinique), Ivory Coast, and the Midwestern United States. Modern sex magic associated with Gnosticism The use of the term 'gnostic' by sexual magic groups is a modern phenomenon. Hugh Urban concludes that, \\"despite the very common use of sexual symbolism throughout Gnostic texts, there is little evidence (apart from the accusations of the early church) that the Gnostics engaged in any actual performance of sexual rituals, and certainly not anything resembling modern sexual magic.\\"Urban (2006) p. 36 note 68 Modern sexual magic began with Paschal Beverly Randolph.Urban (2006) p. 36 The connection to Gnosticism came by way of the French Gnostic Church with its close ties to the strong esoteric current in France, being part of the same highly interconnected milieu of esoteric societies and orders from which the most influential of sexual magic orders arose, the Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of Oriental Templars, OTO). Theodor Reuss founded the OTO as an umbrella occult organization with sexual magic at its core.Greer (2003) p. 221-2 After Reuss came into contact with French Gnostic Church leaders at a Masonic and Spiritualist conference in 1908, he founded Die Gnostische Katholische Kirche (the Gnostic Catholic Church), under the auspices of the OTO. Reuss subsequently dedicated the OTO to the promulgation of Crowley's philosophy of Thelema. It is for this church body, called in Latin the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC), that Aleister Crowley wrote the Ecclesi√¶ Gnostic√¶ Catholic√¶ Canon Miss√¶ (\\"Canon of the Mass of the Gnostic Catholic Church\\"),The Equinox III:1 (1929) p. 247 the central ritual of the OTO that is now commonly called the Gnostic Mass. The Gnostic Society The Gnostic Society, was founded for the study of Gnosticism in 1928 and incorporated in 1939 by Theosophists James Morgan Pryse and his brother John Pryse in Los Angeles.Pearson, B. (2007) p. 240Smith (1995) p. 206 Since 1963 it has been under the direction of Stephan Hoeller and operates in association with the Ecclesia Gnostica. Initially begun as an archive for a usenet newsgroup in 1993, the Gnosis Archive became the first web site to offer historic and source materials on Gnosticism. Mid-20th century The Gospel of Thomas, held to be the most complete of the Nag Hammadi texts, is the subject of the book The Mustard Seed by Indian mystic Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho. Ecclesia Gnostica Established in 1953 by Richard Duc de Palatine in England under the name 'the Pre-nicene Gnostic Catholic Church', the Ecclesia Gnostica (Latin: \\"Church of Gnosis\\" or \\"Gnostic Church\\") is said to represent 'the English Gnostic tradition', although it has ties to, and has been influenced by, the French Gnostic church tradition. It is affiliated with the Gnostic Society, an organization dedicated to the study of Gnosticism. The presiding bishop is the Rt. Rev. Stephan A. Hoeller, who has written extensively on Gnosticism. Centered in Los Angeles, the Ecclesia Gnostica has parishes and educational programs of the Gnostic Society spanning the Western US and also in the Kingdom of Norway. The lectionary and liturgical calendar of the Ecclesia Gnostica have been widely adopted by subsequent Gnostic churches, as have the liturgical services in use by the church, though in somewhat modified forms. = Ecclesia Gnostica Mysteriorum = The Ecclesia Gnostica Mysteriorum (EGM), commonly known as \\"the Church of Gnosis\\" or \\"the Gnostic Sanctuary,\\" was initially established in Palo Alto by bishop Rosamonde Miller as a parish of the Ecclesia Gnostica, but soon became an independent body with emphasis on the experience of gnosis and the balance of the divine masculine and feminine principles. The Gnostic Sanctuary is now located in Redwood City, California. The EGM also claims a distinct lineage of Mary Magdalene from a surviving tradition in France. Samael Aun Weor in South America Samael Aun Weor left the FRA after the death of Arnold Krumm Heller. He reports an experience of being called to his new mission by the venerable White Lodge (associated with Theosophy). Samael Aun Weor taught a \\"New Gnosis,\\" consisting of sexual union between man and woman, without the ejaculation of the sexual liquid. He called this the Arcanum AZF. For him it is \\"the synthesis of all religions, schools and sects.\\" Moving through Latin America, he finally settled in Mexico where he founded the Movimiento Gnostico Cristiano Universal (MGCU) (Universal Gnostic Christian Movement), then subsequently founded the Iglesia Gnostica Cristiana Universal (Universal Gnostic Christian Church) and the Associacion Gnostica de Estudios Antropologicos Culturales y Cientificos (AGEAC) (Gnostic Association of Scientific, Cultural and Anthropological Studies) to spread his teachings.Dawson (2007) p. 54-60 The MGCU became defunct by the time of Samael Aun Weor's death in December 1977. However, his disciples subsequently formed new organizations to spread his teachings, under the umbrella term 'the International Gnostic Movement'. These organizations are currently very active via the Internet and have centers established in Latin America, the US, Australia, Canada and Europe.Dawson (2007) p. 60-65 Hans Jonas The philosopher Hans Jonas wrote extensively on Gnosticism, interpreting it from an existentialist viewpoint. For some time, his study The Gnostic Religion: The message of the alien God and the beginnings of Christianity published in 1958, was widely held to be a pivotal work, and it is as a result of his efforts that the Syrian-Egyptian/Persian division of Gnosticism came to be widely used within the field. The second edition, published in 1963, included the essay \\"Gnosticism, Existentialism, and Nihilism.\\" Eric Voegelin's anti- modernist 'gnostic thesis' In the 1950s, Eric Voegelin entered into an academic debate concerning the classification of modernity following Karl L√∂with's 1949 Meaning in History: the Theological Implications of the Philosophy of History; and Jacob Taubes's 1947 Abendl√§ndishe Eschatologie. In this context, Voegelin put forward his \\"gnosticism thesis\\": criticizing modernity by identifying an \\"immanentist eschatology\\" as the \\"gnostic nature\\" of modernity. Differing with L√∂with, he did not criticize eschatology as such, but rather the immanentization which he described as a \\"pneumopathological\\" deformation. Voegelin's gnosticism thesis became popular in neo-conservative and cold war political thought.Weiss (2000) Gnosticism in popular culture Gnosticism has seen something of a resurgence in popular culture in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This may be related, certainly, to the sudden availability of Gnostic texts to the reading public, following the emergence of the Nag Hammadi library. * Philip K.

Thereafter, Br√ºckner joined the Heer (army), becoming an Oberst (colonel) by war's end. He died in August 1954 in Herbsdorf, Upper Bavaria. Life Br√ºckner was born and raised in Baden- Baden. He did his Abitur there. Afterwards he studied law and economics in Strasbourg (then Stra√üburg, Germany), Freiburg, Heidelberg and Munich. In the First World War, Br√ºckner was an officer in a Bavarian infantry regiment and was discharged as a lieutenant. After the war, he joined the Freikorps Epp and participated in Sch√ºtzenregiment 42 as a member of the Reichswehr in suppressing the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Towards the end of 1919 Br√ºckner was once again going to university, and worked for three years as a film recording technician. In late 1922 he joined the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (SA). On 1 February 1923, he became leader of the Munich SA Regiment. Br√ºckner was among those who were active in spurring on the Putsch. He warned Adolf Hitler early in November \\"We have so many unemployed in the ranks, men who have spent their last on uniforms, that the day is not far off when I won't be able to keep a hold on them unless you act. If nothing happens, we will lose control\\". Br√ºckner became Hitler's adjutant and one of his bodyguards. At the time there were only five men in the personal squad, including Ulrich Graf, Emil Maurice, Christian Weber, and Julius Schaub. Br√ºckner was \\"well liked\\" by the men. On 9 November 1923 Br√ºckner took part in the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, and was found guilty of aiding and abetting high treason. On 1 April 1924 he was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment. Pretrial confinement time was deducted from his sentence; he, along with Wilhelm Frick and Ernst R√∂hm walked out of the courtroom as free men on probation. As soon as they had left the room, the newly freed Br√ºckner shouted to his fellow supporters, \\"It's up to us now!\\" He once again took over his old SA regiment's leadership. From 1924 to 1928 he worked as the third general secretary at the Association for the German Community Abroad (Verein f√ºr Deutsche Kulturbeziehungen im Ausland/VDA). He was employed as a tennis and ski instructor, as well as a sales representative for sporting goods in Munich from 1927 until 1929 when he found work at the German Foreign Institute in Stuttgart. On 15 August 1933 while driving behind Hitler's car, he lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He suffered a broken leg, fractured skull and an injury to an eye. Fortunately for him, the driver of the car following Br√ºckner was the physician, Karl Brandt. Brandt drove Br√ºckner to a hospital in Traunstein, where he operated on his skull and removed one of his badly injured eyes. Brandt spent the next six weeks at Br√ºckner's bedside until his condition improved. It was through this action that Brandt later became Hitler's escort doctor. Br√ºckner was appointed Chief Adjutant to Hitler on 20 February 1934, and retained that role until being dismissed on 18 October 1940. In that role he supervised all of the F√ºhrer's personal servants, valets, bodyguards, and adjutants. He thereby counted among those who were in Hitler's innermost personal circle, playing as one of Hitler's closest confidants next to Joseph Goebbels and Sepp Dietrich in the propaganda film Hitler √ºber Deutschland (1932). On 9 November 1934, he was appointed an SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer by Hitler. On 15 January 1936, Br√ºckner became an honorary citizen of Detmold. (He was stripped of this honour by the city council on 9 November 1945.) Br√ºckner, who was well liked by applicants and everyday visitors at the Reich Chancellery for his straightforwardness and affability, lost ever more importance with the war's outbreak. He was replaced in October 1940 by Julius Schaub. Martin Bormann, then chief of staff in the office for Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess was behind Br√ºckner being replaced by Schaub, who was closer to Bormann. Br√ºckner joined the Heer (army), becoming a colonel by war's end. He died on 18 August 1954 in Herbsdorf, Upper Bavaria.

Louisiana Creoles share cultural ties such as the traditional use of the French, Spanish, and Louisiana Creole languages and predominant practice of Catholicism. The term cr√©ole was originally used by French settlers to distinguish persons born in Louisiana from those born in the mother country or elsewhere. As in many other colonial societies around the world, creole was a term used to mean those who were \\"native-born\\", especially native-born Europeans such as the French and Spanish. It also came to be applied to African-descended slaves and Native Americans who were born in Louisiana.Kathe Managan, The Term \\"Creole\\" in Louisiana : An Introduction , lameca.org. Retrieved December 5, 2013Bernard, Shane K, \\"Creoles\\" , \\"KnowLA Encyclopedia of Louisiana\\". Retrieved October 19, 2011Helen Bush Caver and Mary T. Williams, \\"Creoles\\", Multicultural America, Countries and Their Cultures Website. Retrieved February 3, 2009 The word is not a racial label, and people of fully European descent, fully African descent, or of any mixture therein (including Native American admixture) may identify as Creoles. Starting with the native-born children of the French, as well as native-born African slaves, 'Creole' came to be used to describe Louisiana-born people to differentiate them from European immigrants and imported slaves. People of any race can and have identified as Creoles, and it is a misconception that cr√©olit√©‚Äîthe quality of being Creole‚Äîimplies mixed racial origins. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the class of free people of color in Louisiana became associated with the term Creole and further identification with mixed race took place during the interwar period in the 20th century. One historian has described this period as the \\"Americanization of Creoles,\\" including an acceptance of the American binary racial system that divided Creoles into those who identified as mostly white and others as mostly black. (See Creoles of color.) Cr√©ole was used casually as an identity in the 1700s in Louisiana. Starting in the very early 1800s in Louisiana, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase, the term \\"Creole\\" began to take on a more political meaning and identity, especially for those persons of Latinate culture. These generally Catholic French speakers had a culture that contrasted with the Protestant English-speaking and Anglo culture of the new American settlers from the Upper South and the North. In the early 19th century, amid the Haitian Revolution, thousands of refugees (both whites and free people of color from Saint- Domingue (affranchis or gens de couleur libres) arrived in New Orleans, often bringing enslaved Africans with them. So many refugees arrived that the city's population doubled. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian √©migr√©s who had first gone to Cuba also arrived. These groups had strong influences on the city and its culture. Half of the white √©migrƒó population of Haiti settled in Louisiana, especially in the greater New Orleans area. Later 19th-century immigrants to New Orleans, such as Irish, Germans and Italians, also married into the Creole groups. Most of the new immigrants were also Catholic. There was also a sizable German Creole group of full German descent, centering on the parishes of St. Charles and St. John the Baptist. (It is for these settlers that the C√¥te des Allemands, literally \\"The German Coast\\", is named.) Over time, many of these groups assimilated, in part or completely, into the dominant French Creole culture, often adopting the French language and customs. Although Cajuns are often presented in the twenty-first century as a group distinct from the Creoles, many historical accounts exist wherein persons with Acadian surnames either self-identify or are identified by others as being Creole, and some nineteenth century sources make specific references to \\"Acadian Creoles\\". As people born in colonial Louisiana, people of Acadian ancestry could and can be referred to as Creole, and until the early-mid twentieth century Cajuns were considered a subcategory of Louisiana Creole rather than a wholly separate group. Today, however, some Louisianans who identify as Cajun reject association as Creole, while others may embrace both identities. Creoles of French descent, including those descended from the Acadians, have historically made up the majority of white Creoles in Louisiana. Louisiana Creoles are mostly Catholic in religion. Throughout the 19th century, most Creoles spoke French and were strongly connected to French colonial culture.Christophe Landry, \\"Primer on Francophone Louisiana: more than Cajun\\", \\"francolouisiane.com\\". Retrieved October 19, 2011 The sizeable Spanish Creole communities of Saint Bernard Parish and Galveztown spoke Spanish. The Malague√±os of New Iberia spoke Spanish as well. The Isle√±os and Malague√±os were Louisiana-born whites of Creole heritage. (Since the mid-20th century, however, the number of Spanish-speaking Creoles has declined in favor of English speakers, and few people under 80 years old speak Spanish.) They have maintained cultural traditions from the Canary Islands, where their immigrant ancestors came from.G. Armistead, Samuel. La Tradici√≥n Hispano ‚Äì Canaria en Luisiana (in Spanish: Hispanic Tradition ‚Äì Canary in Louisiana). Page 26 (prorogue of the Spanish edition) and pages 51 ‚Äì 61 (History and languages). Anrart Ediciones. Ed: First Edition, March 2007. However, just as with the Spanish Creoles, native languages of all Creole groups, whether French, Spanish or German, have declined over the years in favor of the English spoken by the majority of the population. The different varieties of Louisiana's Creoles shaped the state's culture, particularly in the southern areas around New Orleans and the plantation districts. Louisiana is known as the Creole State. While the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans, which centered mainly on French Creoles, has historically received much attention, the Cane River area in northwest Louisiana, populated chiefly by Creoles of color, also developed its own strong Creole culture. Other enclaves of Creole culture have been located in south and southwest Louisiana: Frilot Cove, Bois Mallet, Grand Marais, Palmetto, Lawtell, Soileau and others. These communities have had a long history of cultural independence. New Orleans also has had a significant historical population of Creoles of color as well, a group that was mostly free people of color, of mixed European, African, and Native American descent. Another area where many creoles can be found is within the River Parishes: St. Charles, St. John, and St. James. Many Creoles of German and French descent have also settled there. Most French Creoles are found in the greater New Orleans region, a seven parish-wide Creole cultural area including Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Charles, St. Tammany and St. John the Baptist parishes. Also, Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes in Acadiana also have large French creole populations of French descent, also known as French Creoles. History=1st French period Map of North America in 1750, before the French and Indian War (part of the international Seven Years' War (1756 to 1763)). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange). Through both the French and Spanish (late 18th century) regimes, parochial and colonial governments used the term Creole for ethnic French and Spanish born in the New World as opposed to Europe. Parisian French was the predominant language among colonists in early New Orleans. Later the regional French evolved to contain local phrases and slang terms. The French Creoles spoke what became known as Colonial French. Because of isolation, the language in the colony developed differently from that in France. It was spoken by the ethnic French and Spanish and their Creole descendants. The commonly accepted definition of Louisiana Creole today is a person descended from ancestors in Louisiana before the Louisiana Purchase by the United States in 1803. An estimated 7,000 European immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th century, one percent of the number of British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies along the Atlantic coast. Louisiana attracted considerably fewer French colonists than did its West Indian colonies. After the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, which lasted more than two months, the colonists had numerous challenges ahead of them in the Louisiana frontier. Their living conditions were difficult: uprooted, they had to face a new, often hostile, environment, with difficult climate and tropical diseases. Many of these immigrants died during the maritime crossing or soon after their arrival. Hurricanes, unknown in France, periodically struck the coast, destroying whole villages. The Mississippi Delta was plagued with periodic yellow fever epidemics. Europeans also brought the Eurasian diseases of malaria and cholera, which flourished along with mosquitoes and poor sanitation. These conditions slowed colonization. Moreover, French villages and forts were not always sufficient to protect from enemy offensives. Attacks by Native Americans represented a real threat to the groups of isolated colonists. The Natchez killed 250 colonists in Lower Louisiana in retaliation for encroachment by the Europeans. The Natchez warriors took Fort Rosalie (now Natchez, Mississippi) by surprise, killing many individuals. During the next two years, the French attacked the Natchez in return, causing them to flee or, when captured, be deported as slaves to their Caribbean colony of Saint- Domingue (later Haiti). =Casket girls= Aside from French government representatives and soldiers, colonists included mostly young men who were recruited in French ports or in Paris. Some served as indentured servants; they were required to remain in Louisiana for a length of time, fixed by the contract of service, to pay back the cost of passage and board. During this time, they were \\"temporary semi-slaves\\". To increase the colonial population, the government recruited young Frenchwomen, known as filles √† la cassette (in English, casket girls, referring to the casket or case of belongings they brought with them) to go to the colony to be wed to colonial soldiers. The king financed dowries for each girl. (This practice was similar to events in 17th-century Quebec: about 800 filles du roi (daughters of the king) were recruited to immigrate to New France under the monetary sponsorship of Louis XIV.) In addition, French authorities deported some female criminals to the colony. For example, in 1721, the ship La Baleine brought close to 90 women of childbearing age from the prison of La Salp√™tri√®re in Paris to Louisiana. Most of the women quickly found husbands among the male residents of the colony. These women, many of whom were most likely prostitutes or felons, were known as The Baleine Brides.National Genealogical Society Quarterly, December 1987; vol.75, number 4: \\"The Baleine Brides: A Missing Ship's Roll for Louisiana\\" Such events inspired Manon Lescaut (1731), a novel written by the Abb√© Pr√©vost, which was later adapted as an opera in the 19th century. Historian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that casket girls (considered among the ancestors of French Creoles) were transported to Louisiana. (The Ursuline order of nuns, who were said to chaperone the girls until they married, have denied the casket girl myth as well.) Martin suggests this account was mythical. The system of pla√ßage that continued into the 19th century resulted in many young white men having women of color as partners and mothers of their children, often before or even after their marriages to white women.Joan M. Martin, Pla√ßage and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre, in Creole, edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000. French Louisiana also included communities of Swiss and German settlers; however, royal authorities did not refer to \\"Louisianans\\" but described the colonial population as \\"French\\" citizens. Spanish period The French colony was ceded to Spain in the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762), in the final stages of the Seven Years' War, which took place on two continents. The Spanish were slow and reluctant to fully occupy the colony, however, and did not do so until 1769. That year Spain abolished Indian slavery. In addition, Spanish liberal manumission policies contributed to the growth of the population of Creoles of Color, particularly in New Orleans. Nearly all of the surviving 18th-century architecture of the Vieux Carr√© (French Quarter) dates from the Spanish period (the Ursuline Convent an exception). These buildings were designed by French architects, as there were no Spanish architects in Louisiana. The buildings of the French Quarter are of a Mediterranean style also found in southern France. The mixed-race Creole descendants, who developed as a third class of Creoles of color (Gens de Couleur Libres), particularly in New Orleans, were strongly influenced by the French Catholic culture. By the end of the 18th century, many mixed-race Creoles had gained education and tended to work in artisan or skilled trades; a relatively high number were property and slave owners. The Louisiana Creole language developed primarily from the influence of French and African languages, enabling slaves from different tribes and colonists to communicate. 2nd French period and Louisiana Purchase Painting of Creole Woman and Boy by Anna Maria von Phul, 1818 Spain ceded Louisiana back to France in 1800 through the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. Napoleon sold Louisiana (New France) to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, following defeat of his forces in Saint- Domingue. He had been trying to regain control of the island colony following a multi-year slave rebellion. Thousands of refugees from the revolution, both whites and affranchis or Gens de Couleur Libres, arrived in New Orleans, often bringing their African slaves with them. These groups had a strong influence on the city, increasing the number of French speakers, Africans with strong traditional customs, and Creoles of Color. The Haitian Revolution ended in the slaves gaining independence in 1804, establishing the second republic in the Western Hemisphere and the first republic led by black people. While Governor Claiborne and other officials wanted to keep out additional free black men, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian √©migr√©s who had first gone to Cuba also arrived. Many of the white Francophones had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for Bonapartist schemes in Spain.The Bourgeois Frontier : French Towns, French Traders and American Expansion, by Jay Gitlin (2009). Yale University Press. , pg 54 After the Purchase, many Americans were also migrating to Louisiana. Later European immigrants included Irish, Germans, and Italians. During the antebellum years, the major commodity crops were sugar and cotton, cultivated on large plantations along the Mississippi River outside the city with slave labor. Plantations were developed in the French style, with narrow waterfronts for access on the river, and long plots running back inland. Nearly 90 percent of early 19th century immigrants to the territory settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration from Cuba brought 2,731 whites; 3,102 Gens de Couleur Libres; and 3,226 enslaved persons of African descent, which in total doubled the city's population. The city became 63 percent black in population, a greater proportion than Charleston, South Carolina's 53 percent.\\"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries\\", In Motion: African American Migration Experience, New York Public Library. Retrieved May 7, 2008 The transfer of the French colony to the United States and the arrival of Anglo-Americans from New England and the South resulted in a cultural confrontation. Some Americans were reportedly shocked by aspects of the culture and French-speaking society of the newly acquired territory: the predominance of the French language and Roman Catholicism, the free class of mixed-race people, and the strong African traditions of enslaved peoples. They pressured the United States' first governor of the Louisiana Territory, W.C.C. Claiborne, to change it. Particularly in the slave society of the South, slavery had become a racial caste. Since the late 17th century, children in the colonies took the status of their mothers at birth; therefore, all children of enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of the race or status of their fathers. This produced many mixed-race slaves over the generations. Whites classified society into whites and blacks (the latter associated strongly with slaves). Although there was a growing population of free people of color, particularly in the Upper South, they generally did not have the same rights and freedoms as Creoles of Color in Louisiana under French and Spanish rule, who held office in some cases and served in the militia. For example, around 80 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the Battle of Baton Rouge in 1779.Charles Gayarr√©, History of Louisiana: The Spanish domination, William J. Widdleton, 1867, pp 126‚Äì132 And 353 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the Battle of New Orleans in 1812.\\"The Battle of New Orleans\\", wcny.org. Retrieved September 1, 2016 Later on, some of the descendants of these Creole of Color veterans of the Battle of New Orleans, like Caesar Antoine, went on to fight in the American Civil War. When Claiborne made English the official language of the territory, the French Creoles of New Orleans were outraged, and reportedly paraded in protest in the streets. They rejected the Americans' effort to transform them overnight. In addition, upper-class French Creoles thought that many of the arriving Americans were uncouth, especially the rough Kentucky boatmen (Kaintucks) who regularly visited the city, having maneuvered flatboats down the Mississippi River filled with goods for market. Realizing that he needed local support, Claiborne restored French as an official language. In all forms of government, public forums, and in the Catholic Church, French continued to be used. Most importantly, Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole remained the languages of the majority of the population of the state, leaving English and Spanish as minority languages. Ethnic blend and race Adah Isaacs Menken, Creole actress, painter and poet Colonists referred to themselves and enslaved Black people who were native-born as creole, to distinguish them from new arrivals from France and Spain as well as Africa. Native Americans, such as the Creek people, intermixed with Creoles also, making three races present in the ethnic group. Like \\"Cajun,\\" the term \\"Creole\\" is a popular name used to describe cultures in the southern Louisiana area. \\"Creole\\" can be roughly defined as \\"native to a region,\\" but its precise meaning varies according to the geographic area in which it is used. Generally, however, Creoles felt the need to distinguish themselves from the influx of American and European immigrants coming into the area after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. \\"Creole\\" is still used to describe the heritage and customs of the various people who settled Louisiana during the early French colonial times. In addition to the French Canadians, the amalgamated Creole culture in southern Louisiana includes influences from the Chitimacha, Houma and other native tribes, enslaved West Africans, Spanish-speaking Isle√±os (Canary Islanders) and French-speaking Gens de Couleur Libres from the Caribbean. As a group, mixed-race Creoles rapidly began to acquire education, skills (many in New Orleans worked as craftsmen and artisans), businesses and property. They were overwhelmingly Catholic, spoke Colonial French (although some also spoke Louisiana Creole), and kept up many French social customs, modified by other parts of their ancestry and Louisiana culture. The Creoles of Color often married among themselves to maintain their class and social culture. The French-speaking mixed-race population came to be called \\"Creoles of color\\". It was said that \\"New Orleans persons of color were far wealthier, more secure and more established than freed unmixed Black Creoles and Cajuns elsewhere in Louisiana.\\" Under the French and Spanish rulers, Louisiana developed a three-tiered society, similar to that of Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, Saint Lucia, Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Latin colonies. This three-tiered society included white Creoles; a prosperous, educated group of mixed-race Creoles of European, African and Native American descent; and the far larger class of African and Black Creole slaves. The status of mixed-race Creoles of color (Gens de Couleur Libres) was one they guarded carefully. By law they enjoyed most of the same rights and privileges as white Creoles. They could and often did challenge the law in court and won cases against white Creoles. They were property owners and created schools for their children. In many cases though, these different tiers viewed themselves as one group, as other Iberoamerican and Francophone ethnic groups commonly did. Race did not play as central a role as it does in Anglo-American culture: oftentimes, race was not a concern, but instead, family standing and wealth were key distinguishing factors in New Orleans and beyond. The Creole civil rights activist Rodolphe Desdunes explained the difference between Creoles and Anglo-Americans, concerning the widespread belief in racialism by the latter, as follows: > The groups (Latin and Anglo New Orleaneans) had \\"two different schools of > politics [and differed] radically ... in aspiration and method. One hopes > [Latins], and the other doubts [Anglos]. Thus we often perceive that one > makes every effort to acquire merits, the other to gain advantages. One > aspires to equality, the other to identity. One will forget that he is a > Negro to think that he is a man; the other will forget that he is a man to > think that he is a Negro.Christophe Landry, \\"Wearing the wrong spectacles > and catching the Time disease!\\" . Retrieved August 23, 2016 After the United States acquired the area in the Louisiana Purchase, mixed- race Creoles of Color resisted American attempts to impose their binary racial culture. In the American South slavery had become virtually a racial caste, in which most people of any African descent were considered to be lower in status. The planter society viewed it as a binary culture, with whites and blacks (the latter including everyone other than whites, although for some years they counted mulattos separately on censuses). While the American Civil War promised rights and opportunities for the enslaved, the Creoles of Color, who had long been free before the war, worried about losing their identity and position. The Americans did not legally recognize a three-tiered society; nevertheless, some Creoles of Color such as Thomy Lafon, Victor S√©jour and others, used their position to support the abolitionist cause.\\"Keep Up The Fight\\", theneworleanstribune.com.

During the Reconstruction era, Democrats regained power in the Louisiana state legislature by using paramilitary groups like the White League to suppress black voting. The Democrats enforced white supremacy by passing Jim Crow laws and a constitution near the turn of the 20th century that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and Creoles of color through discriminatory application of voter registration and electoral laws. Some white Creoles, such as the ex-Confederate general Pierre G. T. Beauregard, advocated against racism, and became proponents of Black Civil Rights and Black suffrage, involving themselves in the creation of the Louisiana Unification Movement that called for equal rights for blacks, denounced discrimination and the abandonment of segregation.Williams, pp. 282‚Äì84.name=\\"Monumental Heist: A Story of Race; A Race to the White House\\" The US Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 supported the binary society and the policy of \\"separate but equal\\" facilities (which were seldom achieved in fact) in the segregated South. Some white Creoles, heavily influenced by white American society, increasingly claimed that the term Creole applied to whites only. According to Virginia R. Dom√≠nguez: > Charles Gayarr√© ... and Alc√©e Fortier ... led the outspoken though desperate > defense of the Creole.

French-born painter Edgar Degas (a cousin of Creole engineer Norbert Rillieux), who visited New Orleans and painted scenes there Sybil Kein suggests that, because of the white Creoles struggle for redefinition, they were particularly hostile to the exploration by the writer George Washington Cable of the multi-racial Creole society in his stories and novels. She believes that in The Grandissimes, he exposed white Creoles' preoccupation with covering up blood connections with Creoles of Color. She writes: > There was a veritable explosion of defenses of Creole ancestry. The more > novelist George Washington Cable engaged his characters in family feuds over > inheritance, embroiled them in sexual unions with blacks and mulattoes and > made them seem particularly defensive about their presumably pure Caucasian > ancestry, the more vociferously the white Creoles responded, insisting on > purity of white ancestry as a requirement for identification as Creole. In the 1930s, populist Governor Huey Long satirized such Creole claims, saying that you could feed all the \\"pure white\\" people in New Orleans with a cup of beans and a half a cup of rice, and still have food left over! The effort to impose Anglo-American binary racial classification on Creoles continued, however. In 1938, in Sunseri v. Cassagne‚Äîthe Louisiana Supreme Court proclaimed traceability of African ancestry to be the only requirement for definition of colored. And during her time as Registrar of the Bureau of Vital Statistics for the City of New Orleans (1949‚Äì1965), Naomi Drake tried to impose these binary racial classifications. She unilaterally changed records to classify mixed-race individuals as black if she found they had any black (or African) ancestry, an application of hypodescent rules, and did not notify people of her actions. Among the practices Drake directed was having her workers check obituaries. They were to assess whether the obituary of a person identified as white provided clues that might help show the individual was \\"really\\" black, such as having black relatives, services at a traditionally black funeral home, or burial at a traditionally black cemetery‚Äîevidence which she would use to ensure the death certificate classified the person as black. Not everyone accepted Drake's actions and people filed thousands of cases against the office to have racial classifications changed and to protest her withholding legal documents of vital records. This caused much embarrassment and disruption, finally causing the city to fire her in 1965. Culture=Cuisine Louisiana Creole cuisine is recognized as a unique style of cooking originating in New Orleans, starting in the early 1700s. It makes use of what is sometimes called the Holy trinity: onions, celery and green peppers. It has developed primarily from various European, African, and Native American historic culinary influences. A distinctly different style of Creole or Cajun cooking exists in Acadiana. Gumbo (Gomb√¥ in Louisiana Creole, Gombo in Louisiana French) is a traditional Creole dish from New Orleans with French, Spanish, Native American, African, German, Italian, and Caribbean influences. It is a roux-based meat stew or soup, sometimes made with some combination of any of the following: seafood (usually shrimp, crabs, with oysters optional, or occasionally crawfish), sausage, chicken (hen or rooster), alligator, turtle, rabbit, duck, deer or wild boar. Gumbo is often seasoned with fil√©, which is dried and ground sassafras leaves. Both meat and seafood versions also include the \\"Holy Trinity\\" and are served like stew over rice. It developed from French colonists trying to make bouillabaisse with New World ingredients. Starting with aromatic seasonings, the French used onions and celery as in a traditional mirepoix, but lacked carrots, so they substituted green bell peppers. Africans contributed okra, traditionally grown in regions of Africa, the Middle East and Spain. Gombo is the Louisiana French word for okra, which is derived from a shortened version of the Bantu words kilogomb√≥ or kigamb√≥, also guingamb√≥ or quinbomb√≥. \\"Gumbo\\" became the anglicized version of the word 'Gombo' after the English language became dominant in Louisiana. In Louisiana French dialects, the word \\"gombo\\" still refers to both the hybrid stew and the vegetable. The Choctaw contributed fil√©; the Spanish contributed peppers and tomatoes; and new spices were adopted from Caribbean dishes. The French later favored a roux for thickening. In the 19th century, the Italians added garlic. After arriving in numbers, German immigrants dominated New Orleans city bakeries, including those making traditional French bread. They introduced having buttered French bread as a side to eating gumbo, as well as a side of German-style potato salad. Jambalaya is the second of the famous Louisiana Creole dishes. It developed in the European communities of New Orleans. It combined ham with sausage, rice and tomato as a variation of the Spanish dish paella, and was based on locally available ingredients. The name for jambalaya comes from the Occitan language spoken in southern France, where it means \\"mash-up.\\" The term also refers to a type of rice cooked with chicken. Today, jambalaya is commonly made with seafood (usually shrimp) or chicken, or a combination of shrimp and chicken. Most versions contain smoked sausage, more commonly used instead of ham in modern versions. However, a version of jambalaya that uses ham with shrimp may be closer to the original Creole dish.Jambalaya.\\" Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F. Mariani, Bloomsbury, 2nd edition, 2014. Credo Reference, https://login.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/bloomfood/jambalaya/0?institutionId=3205. Accessed October 23, 2019. Jambalaya is prepared in two ways: \\"red\\" and \\"brown\\". Red is the tomato-based version native to New Orleans; it is also found in parts of Iberia and St. Martin parishes, and generally uses shrimp or chicken stock. The red-style Creole jambalaya is the original version. The \\"brown\\" version is associated with Cajun cooking and does not include tomatoes. Red beans and rice is a dish of Louisiana and Caribbean influence, originating in New Orleans. It contains red beans, the \\"holy trinity\\" of onion, celery, and bell pepper, and often andouille smoked sausage, pickled pork, or smoked ham hocks. The beans are served over white rice. It is one of the famous dishes in Louisiana, and is associated with \\"washday Monday\\". It could be cooked all day over a low flame while the women of the house attended to washing the family's clothes. Music Creole women, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana\\" (1935 photo by Ben Shahn) Zydeco (a transliteration in English of 'zaric√¥' (snapbeans) from the song, \\"Les haricots sont pas sal√©s\\"), was born in black Creole communities on the prairies of southwest Louisiana in the 1920s. It is often considered the Creole music of Louisiana. Zydeco, a derivative of Cajun music, purportedly hails from L√†-l√†, a genre of music now defunct, and old south Louisiana jur√©s. As Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole was the lingua franca of the prairies of southwest Louisiana, zydeco was initially sung only in Louisiana French or Creole. Later, Louisiana Creoles, such as the 20th-century Ch√©nier brothers, Andrus Espree (Beau Jocque), Rosie L√©det and others began incorporating a more bluesy sound and added a new linguistic element to zydeco music: English. Today, zydeco musicians sing in English, Louisiana Creole or Colonial Louisiana French. Today's Zydeco often incorporates a blend of swamp pop, blues, and/or jazz as well as \\"Cajun Music\\" (originally called Old Louisiana French Music). An instrument unique to zydeco is a form of washboard called the frottoir or scrub board. This is a vest made of corrugated aluminum, and played by the musician working bottle openers, bottle caps or spoons up and down the length of the vest. Another instrument used in both Zydeco and Cajun music since the 1800s is the accordion. Zydeco music makes use of the piano or button accordion while Cajun music is played on the diatonic accordion, or Cajun accordion, often called a \\"squeeze box\\". Cajun musicians also use the fiddle and steel guitar more often than do those playing Zydeco. Zydeco can be traced to the music of enslaved African people from the 19th century. It is represented in Slave Songs of the United States, first published in 1867. The final seven songs in that work are printed with melody along with text in Louisiana Creole. These and many other songs were sung by slaves on plantations, especially in St. Charles Parish, and when they gathered on Sundays at Congo Square in New Orleans. Among the Spanish Creole people highlights, between their varied traditional folklore, the Canarian D√©cimas, romances, ballads and pan-Hispanic songs date back many years, even to the Medieval Age. This folklore was carried by their ancestors from the Canary Islands to Louisiana in the 18th century. It also highlights their adaptation to the Isle√±o music to other music outside of the community (especially from the Mexican Corridos).

Louisiana French (LF) is the regional variety of the French language spoken throughout contemporary Louisiana by individuals who today identify ethno-racially as Creole, Cajun or French, as well as some who identify as Spanish (particularly in New Iberia and Baton Rouge, where the Creole people are a mix of French and Spanish and speak the French language), African- American, white, Irish, or of other origins. Individuals and groups of individuals through innovation, adaptation, and contact continually enrich the French language spoken in Louisiana, seasoning it with linguistic features that can sometimes only be found in Louisiana. Tulane University's Department of French and Italian website prominently declares \\"In Louisiana, French is not a foreign language\\". Figures from U.S. decennial censuses report that roughly 250,000 Louisianans claimed to use or speak French in their homes. Among the 18 governors of Louisiana between 1803 and 1865, six were French Creoles and spoke French: Jacques Viller√©, Pierre Derbigny, Armand Beauvais, Jacques Dupr√©, Andre B. Roman and Alexandre Mouton. According to the historian Paul Lachance, \\"the addition of white immigrants to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population [in New Orleans] until almost 1830. If a substantial proportion of Creoles of Color and slaves had not also spoken French, however, the Gallic community would have become a minority of the total population as early as 1820.\\"Quoted in Jay Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier: French Towns, French Traders, and American Expansion, Yale University Press. p. 159 In the 1850s, white Francophones remained an intact and vibrant community; they maintained instruction in French in two of the city's four school districts.Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier, p. 166 In 1862, the Union general Ben Butler abolished French instruction in New Orleans schools, and statewide measures in 1864 and 1868 further cemented the policy. By the end of the 19th century, French usage in the city had faded significantly.Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier, p. 180 However, as late as 1902 \\"one-fourth of the population of the city spoke French in ordinary daily intercourse, while another two-fourths was able to understand the language perfectly,\\"Leslie's Weekly, December 11, 1902 and as late as 1945, one still encountered elderly Creole women who spoke no English.Gumbo Ya-Ya: Folk Tales of Louisiana by Robert Tallant & Lyle Saxon.

The Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration: 1938 pg 90 Today, it is generally in more rural areas that people continue to speak Louisiana French or Louisiana Creole. Also during the '40s and '50s many Creoles left Louisiana to find work in Texas, mostly in Houston and East Texas. The language and music is widely spoken there; the 5th ward of Houston was originally called Frenchtown due to that reason. There were also Zydeco clubs started in Houston, like the famed Silver Slipper owned by a Creole named Alfred Cormier that has hosted the likes of Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavais. On the other hand, Spanish usage has fallen markedly over the years among the Spanish Creoles. Still, in the first half of twentieth century, most of the people of Saint Bernard and Galveztown spoke the Spanish language with the Canarian Spanish dialect (the ancestors of these Creoles were from the Canary Islands) of the 18th century, but the government of Louisiana imposed the use of English in these communities, especially in the schools (e.g. Saint Bernard) where if a teacher heard children speaking Spanish she would fine them and punish them. Now, only some people over the age of 80 can speak Spanish in these communities. Most of the youth of Saint Bernard can only speak English. New Orleans Mardi Gras New Orleans Mardi Gras in the early 1890s Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday in English) in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a Carnival celebration well known throughout the world. It has colonial French roots. The New Orleans Carnival season, with roots in preparing for the start of the Christian season of Lent, starts after Twelfth Night, on Epiphany (January 6). It is a season of parades, balls (some of them masquerade balls) and king cake parties. It has traditionally been part of the winter social season; at one time \\"coming out\\" parties for young women at d√©butante balls were timed for this season. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Fat Tuesday (Mardi Gras in French), the day before Ash Wednesday. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the season. In the final week of Carnival, many events large and small occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities. The parades in New Orleans are organized by Carnival krewes. Krewe float riders toss throws to the crowds; the most common throws are strings of plastic colorful beads, doubloons (aluminum or wooden dollar-sized coins usually impressed with a krewe logo), decorated plastic throw cups, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Mardi Gras season activities on Bourbon Street and the French Quarter, none of the major Mardi Gras parades has entered the Quarter since 1972 because of its narrow streets and overhead obstructions. Instead, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. To New Orleanians, \\"Mardi Gras\\" specifically refers to the Tuesday before Lent, the highlight of the season. The term can also be used less specifically for the whole Carnival season, sometimes as \\"the Mardi Gras season\\". The terms \\"Fat Tuesday\\" or \\"Mardi Gras Day\\" always refer only to that specific day.  Creole places =Cane River Creoles While the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans has historically received much attention, the Cane River area developed its own strong Creole culture. The Cane River Creole community in the northern part of the state, along the Red River and Cane River, is made up of multi-racial descendants of French, Spanish, Africans, Native Americans, similar mixed Creole migrants from New Orleans and various other ethnic groups who inhabited this region in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The community is located in and around Isle Brevelle in lower Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. There are many Creole communities within Natchitoches Parish, including Natchitoches, Cloutierville, Derry, Gorum and Natchez. Many of their historic plantations still exist.\\"Cane River Creole Community-A Driving Tour\\" , Louisiana Regional Folklife Center, Northwestern State University.

This area is known for the False River; the parish seat is New Roads, and villages including Morganza are located off the river. This parish is known to be uniquely Creole; today a large portion of the nearly 22,000 residents can trace Creole ancestry. The area was noted for its many plantations and cultural life during the French, Spanish, and American colonial periods. The population here had become bilingual or even trilingual with French, Louisiana Creole, and English because of its plantation business before most of Louisiana. The Louisiana Creole language is widely associated with this parish; the local mainland French and Creole (i.e., locally born) plantation owners and their African slaves formed it as communication language, which became the primary language for many Pointe Coupee residents well into the 20th century. The local white and black populations as well as persons of blended ethnicity spoke the language, because of its importance to the region; Italian immigrants in the 19th century often adopted the language.Costello, Brian J.

This parish was established in 1750. The Creole community in Avoyelles parish is alive and well and has a unique blend of family, food and Creole culture. Creole family names of this region are: Auzenne, Barbin, Beaudoin, Biagas, Bordelon, Boutte, Broussard, Carriere, Chargois, DeBellevue, DeCuir, Deshotels, Dufour, DuCote, Esprit, Fontenot, Fuselier, Gaspard, Gauthier, Goudeau, Gremillion, Guillory, Lamartiniere, Lemelle, Lemoine, LeRoux, Mayeux, Mouton, Moten, Muellon, Normand, Perrie, Rabalais, Ravarre, Saucier, Sylvan and Tyler. A French Creole Heritage day has been held annually in Avoyelles Parish on Bastille Day since 2012.  Evangeline Parish Creoles  Evangeline Parish was formed out of the northwestern part of St. Landry Parish in 1910, and is therefore, a former part of the old Poste des Opelousas territory. Most of this region's population was a direct result of the North American Creole & M√©tis influx of 1763, the result of the end of the French & Indian War which saw former French colonial settlements from as far away as \\"Upper Louisiana\\" (Great Lakes region, Indiana, Illinois) to \\"Lower Louisiana's\\" (Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama), ceded to British America. The majority of these French Creoles and M√©tis peoples chose to leave their former homes electing to head for the only 'French' exempted settlement area in Lower Louisiana, the \\"Territory of Orleans\\" or the modern State of Louisiana. These Creoles and M√©tis families generally did not remain in New Orleans and opted for settlement in the northwestern \\"Creole parishes\\" of higher ground. This area reaches upwards to Pointe Coupee, St. Landry, Avoyelles and what became Evangeline Parish in 1910. Along with these diverse M√©tis & Creole families came West Indian slaves (Caribbean people). Still later, Saint-Domingue/Haitian Creoles, Napoleonic soldiers, and 19th century French families would also settle this region. One of Napoleon Bonaparte's adjutant majors is actually considered the founder of Ville Platte, the parish seat of Evangeline Parish. General Antoine Paul Joseph Louis Garrigues de Flaugeac and his fellow Napoleonic soldiers, Benoit DeBaillon, Louis Van Hille, and Wartelle's descendants also settled in St. Landry Parish and became important public, civic, and political figures. They were discovered on the levee in tattered uniforms by a wealthy Creole planter, \\"Grand Louis' Fontenot of St. Landry (and what is now, Evangeline Parish), a descendant of one of Governor Jean-Batiste LeMoyne, Sieur de Bienville's French officers from Fort Toulouse, in what is now the State of Alabama.Napoleon's Soldiers in America, by Simone de la Souchere-Delery, 1998 Many Colonial French, Swiss German, Austrian, and Spanish Creole surnames still remain among prominent and common families alike in Evangeline Parish. Some later Irish and Italian names also appear. Surnames such as, Ardoin, Aguillard, Mouton, Bordelon, Boucher, Brignac, Brunet, Buller (Buhler), Catoire, Chapman, Coreil, Darbonne, DeBaillion, DeVille, DeVilliers, Duos, Dupre' Estillette, Fontenot, Guillory, Gradney, LaFleur, Landreneau, LaTour, LeBas, LeBleu, LeRoux, Milano-Hebert, Miller, Morein, Moreau, Moten, Mounier, Ortego, Perrodin, Pierotti, Pitre (rare Acadian-Creole), Rozas, Saucier, Schexnayder, Sebastien, Sittig, Soileau, Vidrine, Vizinat and many more are reminiscent of the late French Colonial, early Spanish and later American period of this region's history.Louisiana's French Creole Culinary & Linguistic Traditions: Facts vs. Fiction Before And Since Cajunization 2013, by J. LaFleur, Brian Costello w/ Dr. Ina Fandrich As of 2013, the parish was once again recognized by the March 2013 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature as part of the Creole Parishes, with the passage of SR No. 30. Other parishes so recognized include Avoyelles, St. Landry and Pointe Coupee Parishes. Natchitoches Parish also remains recognized as \\"Creole\\". Evangeline Parish's French-speaking Senator, Eric LaFleur sponsored SR No. 30 which was written by Louisiana French Creole scholar, educator and author, John laFleur II. The parish's namesake of \\"Evangeline\\" is a reflection of the affection the parish's founder, Paulin Fontenot had for Henry Wadsworth's famous poem of the same name, and not an indication of the parish's ethnic origin. The adoption of \\"Cajun\\" by the residents of this parish reflects both the popular commerce as well as media conditioning, since this northwestern region of the French- speaking triangle was never part of the Acadian settlement region of the Spanish period.Dr. Carl A. Brasseaux's \\"The Founding of New Acadia: The Beginnings of Acadian Life in Louisiana,\\" 1765‚Äì1803 The community now hosts an annual \\"Creole Families Bastille Day (weekend) Heritage & Honorarium Festival in which a celebration of Louisiana's multi-ethnic French Creoles is held, with Catholic mass, Bastille Day Champagne toasting of honorees who've worked in some way to preserve and promote the French Creole heritage and language traditions. Louisiana authors, Creole food, and cultural events featuring scholarly lectures and historical information along with fun for families with free admission, and vendor booths are also a feature of this very interesting festival which unites all French Creoles who share this common culture and heritage.  St. Landry Creoles  St. Landry Parish has a significant population of Creoles, especially in Opelousas and its surrounding areas. The traditions and Creole heritage are prevalent in Opelousas, Port Barre, Melville, Palmetto, Lawtell, Eunice, Swords, Mallet, Frilot Cove, Plaisance, Pitreville, and many other villages, towns and communities. The Roman Catholic Church and French/Creole language are dominant features of this rich culture. Zydeco musicians host festivals all through the year.

Blood degree cannot be obtained through adoptive parents. The blood degree on previously issued CDIBs or on the base rolls in the filer's ancestry are used to determine the filer's blood degree (unless they challenge them as inaccurate). Information collected for the filing is held confidential by privacy laws, except if the CDIB is related to assigned duties. A CDIB can show only the blood degree of one tribe or the total blood degree from all tribes in the filer's ancestry. Some tribes require a specific minimum degree of tribal ancestry for membership, which might require the first type of certificate, while some federal benefits programs require a minimum total Indian blood degree so an individual might require the second type of certificate to qualify. For example, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires at least 1/16 degree of Eastern Cherokee blood for tribal membership, whereas the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Higher Education Grant for college expenses requires a 1/4 degree minimum. A Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood does not establish membership in a tribe. Tribal membership is determined by tribal laws and may or may not require a CDIB or may require a separate tribal determination of ancestry or blood degree.\\"Native American Tribal Enrollment.\\" Native American Rights Fund: National Indian Law Library. (retrieved 6 Feb 2011) The CDIB is controversial, from a racial politics perspective, and because non-federally recognized tribes are neither eligible for the card nor for the benefits which require one. Some groups, such as the Cherokee freedmen, were often not eligible for a CDIB because they are not Native American by blood or their degree of blood was not recorded in the base rolls (where Freedman was used instead of stating a degree).\\"Sample Freedman Documents.\\" African-Native American Genealogy.

Hein & Co., Inc., of New York City. Overview Created in 1976, the INLR was originally a reprint journal that served the scholarly community as an anthology of the most seminal law review articles on immigration and nationality. It included legislative summaries and a limited number of original contributions. Since its move to the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1999 from Western New England College School of Law, the journal has substantially expanded to include student casenotes, comments, book reviews and essays. Today, the INLR is one of only two major student-edited American law journals devoted exclusively to the study of immigration law, the other being the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal. The Journal publishes articles on timely issues by professors and practitioners, coordinates symposia on important topics, and produces thoughtful student notes and comments. The INLR's broad scholarly scope often transcends the subject of immigration and encompasses the related fields of constitutional and criminal law, human rights, international law, and ethnic conflict. Second and third year law students are responsible for coordinating the production of the journal under the guidance of Professor Bradford Mank, the INLR's faculty advisor. The journal consists of original immigration and nationality law articles, republications of immigration and nationality law articles, and original student submissions which are selected for their excellence. While primarily focused on immigration law, which seeks to define who may enter and reside in a country, INLR incorporates subject matter well beyond immigration. In particular, the INLR addresses issues of nationality which considers the formal relationship between a citizen of a nation and the nation itself. Since immigration and nationality work together to delineate citizenship and residency, they play an important part in the ongoing dialogue regarding national identity. Moreover, immigration and nationality frequently implicate issues of race, gender, class, and national security. External links *The Immigration and Nationality Law Review *INLR at William S.

Trees released only one album on MCA Records in 1982. Sleep Convention was produced by Dane Conover and engineered by Earle Mankey. The album is considered pop rock and has a length of just over 37 minutes It was a critical success but a commercial failure, which was likely due to poor promotion due to a big change in personnel at the label around the time of the album's release. The band also filmed five low budget music videos. After the album's commercial failure, Conover was released from his contract with MCA and moved on to other projects, such as 'Popgems' with his wife Marisa. This would later become the name of their current YouTube channel. Both are still active in writing and recording pop music, and collaborating with other musicians. America Records had temporary rights from MCA to re-release five songs from the album from 1982 to 1984. As of June 2007, Conover and his wife Marisa created a profile on YouTube and uploaded three of the Trees music videos. Two of the three had never been aired before, which were \\"Delta Sleep\\", and \\"India\\". \\"Shock of the New\\", however, aired on MTV2. In November 2007, he uploaded the \\"Red Car\\" music video, and on September 18, 2008, he uploaded the \\"Come Back\\" music video which also aired during the MTV2 A to Z Marathon of 2000.

It was created as a Varsity Scout program activity, open to Venturers and older Boy Scouts. It has continued since the disbanding of the Varsity Scout program at the end of 2017. The event is mainly held in the western United States, but has included Hawaii and New York. The basic idea is to have Scouts scattered across a particular area, located on mountain peaks or other prominent points within line of sight of each other. Using large signaling mirrors, they relay messages from peak to peak. Success in the event depends on team skills such as map-reading, compass skills, mirror-building, mirror signaling and teamwork. Many units spend time in the weeks or months before the actual event learning communications skills like ham radio and signaling. Reaching the peak can also be a challenge, requiring the boys to practice hiking, camping, and backpacking skills. They also need to consider what they will do if the clouds block the sun. The name \\"Operation On-Target\\" was chosen at its inception in 1980 because: \\"The purpose of the experience was to get the Scouts on target with the Varsity Scout program, and on target on the peaks with mirrors\\" - Doug Brewer , founder of Operation On-Target. Two main goals are to establish a signal link from the Mexico‚ÄìUS border to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, and to make a link from the Pacific Ocean to at least the continental divide. The event has been annual since 1981. As many as 5,000 scouts have participated in a single year, with participation from Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington, from Puget Sound in Washington to Catalina Island and San Diego in California. The annual event is held on the third Saturday in July and September. Areas with warmer climates typically see larger turnout on the latter date. A manual for this event was developed by the Great Salt Lake Council, was later reprinted in one of the Varsity Scout Program Helps books, and now is a chapter in the Boy Scouts of America Varsity Team Features Volume II handbook. While even small handheld mirrors, 3\\" to 4\\" on a side, can be seen 30 miles away, teams are encouraged to take along at least one large mirror. The classic large Operation On-Target signal mirror is a modular design with four square feet of reflecting area, transported in backpacks and assembled on-site. It consists of four 12\\"x12\\" mirrors bolted to a square of plywood with wing bolts and mounted on a light tripod. A small aimable signal mirror is taped to one edge as a sight.  Early beginnings  Operation On- Target was foreshadowed by the 1964-1965 \\"Signal Festival\\"\\"Scouts Plan Signal Event At Clearfield\\" Ogden Standard Examiner, July 21, 1965, page 12A organized by Glannin A. Cloward, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and World War II veteran. In 1964 Mr. Cloward led a group of 10 Explorer Scouts from Post 156 (Clearfield, Utah) to the top of Mt. Timpanogos; from there they flashed signals (reflected sunlight) down to the inhabitants of Utah Valley (see photos) using pieces of old mirrors from which Mr. Cloward had created signal mirrors patterned after those carried in military aircraft survival kits. Several dozen local residents, seeing bright flashes from the peak, improvised return signals using household mirrors from locations around the valley approximately 5 to 25 miles away. The following year a peak-to-peak signaling event was attempted between five peaks in northern Utah, but due to bad weather and inadequate planning communication was successful only between two of the five peaks. Mr. Cloward organized similar activities involving one to three scout units multiple times from 1965 to 1979 from various mountain peaks in central and northern Utah. In 1980 Mr. Douglas G. Brewer, Varsity Scout commissioner for the Great Salt Lake Council, and several other Scout Leaders built upon Mr. Cloward's experience to create Operation On-Target as a well coordinated, multi-council, multi-state activity in the nascent Varsity Scouting program.

There are around 7500 players and 55 clubs competing across 6 divisions, making \\"Subbies\\" the largest centrally administered rugby competition in the world. NSWSRU is truly the grassroots of rugby in Sydney. The major trophy in \\"Subbies\\" is the Kentwell Cup that is awarded to the first grade premiers of the first division competition. The NSWSRU selects representative sides to compete against New South Wales Country for the Maher- Ross Cup, and Queensland Suburban for the Barraclough Shield. History Football under rugby rules began to be played in the 1860s in Sydney's schools. Some of these former students wanted to go on playing and, along with an increasing population of new arrivals in Sydney, this led to the start of club football. After 1872, rugby football clubs grew rapidly in number. The first 'Junior' clubs: 1872 to 1900 Sydney rugby in the early years was played by Senior teams and Junior teams (where Junior denoted the second tier, not the age of the players). The Senior competition was run by the Southern Rugby Union (SRU, later to become the NSWRU) and had been in existence from 1874, but matches for Junior sides were arranged on an ad hoc basis until after the 1885 season. The SRU only began to involve itself in rugby for Junior teams in 1882, and only established a formal Junior competition in 1886. Some of the clubs in the original Junior competition were Petersham (who still exist in the Suburban competition today), Manly Federals, the Warrigals and Wentworth. Most of these clubs fielded one team and the competition received coverage in Sydney's newspapers under \\"Other matches\\". By 1896, in an early sign of what later led to the schism with rugby league, tensions emerged with suggestions that Senior clubs were trying to poach players with talent at Junior clubs using ‚Äòincentives‚Äô and that Junior players were being paid a match fee. A new branch of the NSWRU called the Metropolitan Rugby Union (MRU) was formed in 1897 to administer the Sydney competitions and re-organise the clubs along district lines. The previous Junior clubs and players were essentially merged into new district clubs. More than twenty Junior clubs, including foundation members of the union, vanished from the books in 1898. City and Suburban Association formed in 1901 Most clubs that were disenfranchised in the move to district football between 1897 and 1900 simply went out of existence but a few, such as Petersham, continued playing matches between themselves beyond the control of the MRU and NSWRU. In 1901 the competition was formally organised under the City and Suburban Association, making it the earliest forerunner of today's Subbies rugby. To counter this new rebel association, the MRU created its own Borough competition in 1902. Several of the leading City and Suburban clubs switched to this competition but, with the start of rugby league in 1908, it did not continue. With the advent of the Great War in 1914, most rugby union clubs ceased playing altogether and rugby league had won ascendancy in New South Wales. Post-war reformation in 1919 After the war was ended, the NSWRU established one competition for the 1919 season with divisions for both non-district and district clubs. The Mosman Rugby Club, as the winner of the Reserve Grade B division (effectively the first grade for non-district clubs), was presented with a cup donated by W.H. Kentwell in 1923. This began the long history of the Kentwell Cup which is now awarded to the NSWSRU first grade premiers in first division. The Burke Cup, was first presented to the Mosman club's second grade winning side in 1924 by James A. Burke, and is now contested by NSWSRU second grade teams in first division. Sub-Districts Rugby Union The NSWRU formed a separate non-district club competition in 1929, which became the Metropolitan Sub-Districts Rugby Union in 1933. The Whiddon Cup was inaugurated in 1933 by Horace Whiddon of the Briars Club, and is now awarded to the NSWSRU third grade premiers. At the start of the war in 1939 the NSWRU decided to cancel representative games but continue with club competitions. This was an attempt to ward off a repeat of the setback caused by the cessation of rugby during the previous war. All sports were ravaged during the war. Players and officials died or were injured during battle or as prisoners of war but, as at least a restricted form of the game was continued, rugby union was able to be successfully revived in 1946. After the war, Subbies rugby grew strongly. In 1966 Petersham made history as being the first club to circle the world on a rugby tour. The Sydney Sub-Districts Rugby Union was established in 1971, and the Subbies competition was rearranged into three divisions. New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union In 1990, the Subbies became known as the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union. The second division of the Sydney district competition was absorbed into Subbies in 1993 and 18 clubs contested the Kentwell Cup in that year. Drummoyne, Mosman, University of NSW and Hornsby, Hawkesbury Agricultural College, Canterbury, Dundas Valley, Hawkesbury Valley are former district clubs that moved to Subbies. Most current clubs are based on a local community, links with schools, or voluntary groups. Old Ignatians, St Patricks, Barker Old Boys, Knox Rugby Club, Waverley, Kings Old Boys, and Oakhill are or were formed from ex- students of schools. The Bronte and Manly Savers clubs are composed of members of surf lifesaving clubs. Promotion and relegation is based on club championship results down to third division. Recent events There have been problems in recent years fielding a 4th Division competition (clubs with 3 grade teams). 4th Division was disbanded after the 2008 season, where only six clubs participated, and was further weakened with the withdrawal of two of the 3rd grade teams. The 4th Division was resurrected in 2011, again with six clubs, but again was afflicted with the withdrawal of two 3rd grade teams, although a Halligan Cup team ‚Äì Colleagues Convicts ‚Äì stepped up into the grade. In 2012 the season was played without a 4th division competition again. The 4th Division competition was revived in 2014, but with it came the demise of the 5th Division (clubs with 2 teams). This means that clubs who were hoping to have 2 teams this year must either downsize to one team (Division 6) or hope for a 3rd grade team and push for the revived Division 4, making clubs either make players miss out on playing if unable to find a Halligan Cup fixture (lack of a 2nd grade) or trying to create a 3rd grade (possibly making players play 2 or more games of rugby).

The tape helped secure a recording contract with Creation Records, with most of the tracks ending up on the band's first batch of releases, including their debut album, Definitely Maybe. The Live Demonstration cassette was reissued in a limited amount on 12 April 2014 for the 20th anniversary of Definitely Maybe. The reissue appears almost identical to the original, down to the handwritten cassette label, Union Jack artwork, and Noel Gallagher's 1993 contact information; the notable differences are that the reissued spine says \\"Oasis\\" whereas the original says \\"Oasis Live\\", the copyright marking \\"‚ìÖ & ¬© 1993 Big Brother Recordings Ltd\\" on the cassette itself, and liner notes written by Mark Coyle on the inside of the J-card. Overview In 1992, Oasis were an up-and-coming live act in Manchester, with a small following, but no signs of a record contract. Realising their potential, Oasis guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher contacted Tony Griffiths of the Liverpool band The Real People. The two had met on a North American tour with the Inspiral Carpets, on which The Real People had been the opening act and Gallagher had worked as a roadie. Gallagher asked him if Oasis could use their studio to produce a professional sounding demo which they could then send to record companies. Griffiths and his brother Chris claim to have taught the band a lot about recording songs during that period. Around a dozen songs were recorded at the studio at Dock Road, Liverpool in Spring 1993, of which six songs ended up on the final demo tape. The versions of \\"D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman?\\" and \\"Married With Children\\" were recorded at the home of co-producer Mark Coyle. It is estimated that 10 cassette copies were sent out with a J-card insert depicting a swirling Union Jack and the now famous Oasis logo designed by Tony French. More cassettes were handed out without the picture sleeve, but with instead, a handwritten set of notes. In May 1993, the band were invited to play a gig at the famous Glasgow nightclub King Tut's, by a band who shared their rehearsal rooms.Vh1 Behind the Music Oasis found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey to Glasgow. Among the people at the club that night was head of Creation Records, Alan McGee, who knew some of the other acts playing. Upon seeing Oasis for the first time, he was apparently so impressed that after the show, he went up to the band and offered them a record deal on the spot. A copy of the demo tape was handed to McGee that night, of which the contents made McGee even more determined to sign up the band. A couple of months later, Oasis signed a 6-album deal with Creation Records. As Oasis' fame grew in the 1990s the tape soon became an item desired by collectors and copies started changing hands for hundreds of pounds. In the 2016 edition of \\"Rare Record Price Guide\\" published by Record Collector, an advertisement by Omega Auctions (on page 1) states a copy has since been sold for more than ¬£6,000. The strength of the tracks on Live Demonstration was proved by the fact that four of the tracks eventually ended up on Definitely Maybe; (\\"Married with Children\\", \\"Rock 'N' Roll Star\\", \\"Bring It on Down\\" and \\"Columbia\\"), with three others appearing as B-sides (\\"D'Yer Wanna Be a Spaceman?\\", \\"Fade Away\\" and \\"Cloudburst\\"). The other song, \\"Strange Thing\\", saw its first commercial release in May 2014, with the release of the 20th anniversary edition of Definitely Maybe.

Dogs displaying this trait can also be described as persevering, ready and willing, full of fight, spirited, or plucky. Dog fighting breeds In dog fighting breeds gameness is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack in baiting, despite ripped flesh, dehydration, exhaustion or broken bones. As one writer describes it, \\"Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs.\\" The scope and method of training to develop a game dog varies dramatically depending on the level and experience of the dog-fighter. Some famous \\"gamebred\\" dogs are the American Pit Bull Terrier and Bull Terrier. Working terrier breeds Pertaining to working terriers and other small hunting dogs, earthdog trials are used to determine the dog's gameness in hunting dangerous pest species underground. The American Working Terrier Association currently offers a Certificate of Gameness (CG) title as a basic instinct test (meaning that it is done without conditioning/training the dog, to see if the dog naturally exhibits gameness) for working terriers and dachshunds. In the past, the Irish Kennel Club required the now-discarded Teastas Mor certification for champion animals (intended for breeding) which involved \\"showing gameness in attacking badgers. Five minutes is the minimum period a terrier shall be in contact with the badger, except when the terrier draws the badger in less time.\\" \\"Drawing\\" meant pulling the badger out of the hole. The purpose of the Teastas Mor was to determine the dog's capabilities for work and fitness for breeding, not primarily for entertainment as in the blood-sports of baiting.

Lucrezia Aguiari (sometimes spelled Agujari) (1743/46 in Ferrara ‚Äì 18 May 1783 in Parma) was an Italian coloratura soprano. She possessed an unusually agile voice with a large vocal range that spanned slightly more than three and a half octaves; faculties that enabled her to perform the most difficult passage work. In a letter dated 24 March 1770 Leopold Mozart wrote of hearing her perform a C an octave above high C at the Ducal opera of Parma, \\"I could not believe that she was able to reach C soprano acuto, but my ears convinced me.\\"Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell. \\"Aguiari [Agujari], Lucrezia ['La Bastardina', 'La Bastardella']\\", Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Aldous Huxley also mentioned this event in his novel, Brave New World, (misspelt as 'Ajugari'). Biography Born in Ferrara, during her lifetime Aguiari was often referred to as \\"La Bastardina\\" or \\"La Bastardella\\". There are several different traditions explaining the origin of this nickname, one being that she was the illegitimate child of Leopoldo Aguiari or that of his wife with the Marchese Bentivoglio. Another possible explanation was that she was an abandoned child raised by Aguiari. Another curiosity about the soprano was that she possessed a pronounced limp that was reportedly the result of a dog or hog eating part of her leg while she was an infant. Aguiari studied with Brizio Petrucci in Ferrara and then was further educated at a convent in Florence, where she received singing lessons from Abb√© Lambertini. In 1764 she made her professional opera debut in Florence and the following year made appearances at the opera houses in Padua, Lucca and Verona. In 1766 she appeared in Genoa, Lucca, and Parma; ultimately becoming a Court singer in the latter city in 1768. That same year, in Naples, she sang the title role at the world premiere of Paisiello's Le nozze di Peleo e Tetide, (on the occasion of the wedding ceremony of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria). She also had several great successes in Milan, Paris, and London. There is no documentation to support reports that she was involved romantically with the composer Josef Mysliveƒçek during her early career, in spite of many reports that appear in musicological literature. No mention of a love affair with Mysliveƒçek pre-dates the publication of the fifth edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1954).This finding is documented in Daniel E. Freeman, Josef Mysliveƒçek, \\"Il Boemo\\" (Sterling Heights, Mich.: Harmonie Park Press, 2009). In 1780 Aguiari married the composer Giuseppe Colla (1731‚Äì1806). She left the stage after the close of the summer opera season at Genoa in 1782 due to ill health. Although it was rumoured that she was poisoned by a jealous rival, she actually died of tuberculosis in 1783 at the age of 40.

She is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) under her real name. She is also known for her first stint with WWE, appearing on the SmackDown brand and also known for her time with the developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling, under the ring name Serena. She also made appearances for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, where she was a six-time Women's Champion, Shimmer Women Athletes and Wrestling New Classic, where she is a one-time WNC Women's Champion.  Early life  Serena Deeb's love of wrestling began when she was eleven after watching a World Wrestling Federation show. However, her main passion as a child, from the age of five until she actively pursued wrestling at 18, was soccer. Serena Deeb graduated from Oakton High School, located in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Vienna, Virginia, in 2004. Though she began training for wrestling at age 18, she coupled this with an academic career, studying for her Bachelor of Arts in Spanish until graduating in 2008 from Indiana University Southeast. She has a desire to learn more languages, other than Spanish, and also enjoys Arabic, Thai, and Italian food which matches her interest in traveling.  Professional wrestling career = Ohio Valley Wrestling  Training and debut (2005‚Äì2006) = Serena started her wrestling career in the OVW Wrestling School, training from March until November 2005 after relocating on her own money from Virginia to Kentucky to attend the school. She debuted on the November 4 OVW house show, teaming with Fuji Cakes in a losing effort against Shelly Martinez and Beth Phoenix. Beth Phoenix and Shelly Martinez also defeated her in January even with the new tag team partner of Venus (Rosa Salvage). She picked up her maiden victory over Shelly Martinez in February and over Beth Phoenix the following month. Her misfortune in tag team action continued though, as she and Fuji Cakes lost to Cherry Pie and Roni Jonah. Unhappy with the loss, Serena changed her partners and teamed with Roadkill and Kasey James for a mixed tag team match with The Untouchables, including Cherry Pie, but lost once more. Later that month, a dark match between her and Beth Phoenix ended in a no contest and was changed into a tag match, which Serena and Shelly Martinez lost to Beth Phoenix and Maria. Serena then began to feud with ODB. In early June, Martinez guest refereed a tag team match where she and Daisy Mae defeated ODB and Sosay. At OVW's Six Flags event, ODB scored a return victory as she and Venus defeated Serena and Daisy. In her television debut at the June 21 tapings, Serena came out to save the participants of OVW's first bikini contest, who had been attacked by ODB. She defeated ODB in a singles match at another Six Flags show at the end of June but the two continued to feud, exchanging victories in mixed tag team and six-man tag team matches. Eventually, ODB declared herself the inaugural Women's Champion, supposedly after winning a tournament in Rio de Janeiro. ODB retained the title in an eight-woman Battle Royal on the September 6 television tapings but in a four-way match, Serena finally managed to win the Women's Championship during the main event of the September 13 episode of OVW TV involving ODB, Beth Phoenix and Katie Lea. = Women's Champion (2006‚Äì2008) = When she became champion, Serena was targeted by Beth Phoenix. She managed to retain her title on September 16's house show but lost a televised rematch on October 4. Serena instantly set her sights on winning back the title and commandeered an all female six-man tag team victory over Beth Phoenix and her team three days later before interfering in Beth's title defence, spearing her to end the match in disqualification just as Phoenix was about to pin ODB. Though she would continue to interfere with Phoenix, Serena never had the chance to win back the title as Katie 'The Kat' Lea won the championship in the penultimate round of a gauntlet match Phoenix had to contest, losing on the sixth match while a refreshed Kat only had Serena to defend against. Serena tried to contend with The Kat once more for the title but the match ended in disqualification. To settle their dispute, Serena, The Kat and Beth Phoenix closed out the year with a non-title no- disqualification three way, which Serena won. During 2007, Serena spent many weeks in a variety of tag team matches in an attempt to gain an opportunity at the Women's Champion and Phoenix too before competing in the Miss OVW Divalympics, though ODB would eventually win this competition. Serena went on an undefeated streak in March and April but this was brought to a halt by Lea in May. On May 11 she and her team lost a 2/3 tug of war contest, but beat them in the wrestling tag match immediately afterwards. It would not be until September before she received another shot at the title. Milena Roucka picked up the victory in this six-way match-up, while Serena also lost a non-title match the following week in an attempt to prove her contendership. After spending the opening months of 2008 on a losing streak, Serena disappeared in February from the promotion. During her hiatus, Serena got a nose job and breast implants in an attempt to get closer to a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. Serena made a surprise return in late May when reigning champion Josie issued an open challenge, which Serena answered to win her second title. At the June 4 TV tapings, Serena stated her intentions to defend the title at all times, under 24/7 rules. Josie, who had assaulted her during the speech, took advantage of the rule in early July when Serena defended her title successfully against Reggie, only for Josie to attack her straight afterwards and win the title. Serena avenged this loss by similarly attacking Josie during a speech and winning the title back. The ruling proved too chaotic ‚Äì at one point Serena gave a speech during which Josie and Melody attacked her, almost double-pinning her only for Reggie to come out and pin all three of them to win the title for a matter of minutes until Serena speared Reggie and won it back ‚Äì and by August the 24/7 ruling was deactivated after Serena won the title back for an unprecedented sixth time. After this, wrestler Moose sought Serena's affections, eventually winning a right to a date after defeating Lumpy Magoo in late September. After being rebuffed by Serena on the date, Moose turned sour and tried to interfere in a championship defence against Josie only for Magoo, who was accompanying Serena, to make sure his interference did not cost her the title. On October 29, Serena teamed with Magoo and defeated Moose and Women's Championship contender Reggie in a tag team match. On November 12, Serena lost the championship to Melody in a four-way match with Josie and Reggie. = The Insurgency (2009) = In 2009, Serena turned heel for the first time in her career. This was signalled when she appeared on January 14 with The Insurgency (Ali Akbar, Turcan Celik and Bin Hamin) to help them win a non-title match against the Southern Tag Team Champions Totally Awesome. With Serena in their corner, The Insurgency went on a winning streak, though Serena herself could not emulate this as her title match with Melody on February 25 saw Melody retain the title via disqualification. On the 500th episode of OVW, she challenged Melody once again, this time in a steel cage match, but failed to win the championship.  Shimmer Women Athletes  Early feuds (2006‚Äì2007) = On October 22, 2006, Serena began working for Shimmer Women Athletes at Volume 5 where she lost to Amber O'Neal in her debut match after O'Neal used Serena's tights to keep her down. She gained a victory in a rematch during Volume 6 with a roll-up pin. Despite this win, she went on a losing streak in both tag team and singles competition until she reversed Lexie Fyfe's Attitude Adjuster into a roll-up during Volume 10. Later at Volume 14: Hot Summer Nights Fyfe defeated Daffney and, after exposing her long-suffering knee injury, proceeded to assault her after the match with Experience tag team partner Malia Hosaka. Daffney's friend MsChif and Serena, having history with Fyfe, came to clear the ring leading to a match-up between Hosaka and Serena after the others had been chased off. Serena pinned Hosaka after a spear but her revenge was short lived as The Experience pinned her after a double inverted suplex slam, despite help from Allison Danger. = Pursuit of the Shimmer Championship (2007‚Äì2009) = Serena failed to win the Shimmer Championship, but earned the respect of champion MsChif En route to the tournament to crown the inaugural Shimmer Champion, Serena was involved in a car crash and thus could not participate. An interview with her opened Volume 12, where she revealed her desire to challenge the eventual Shimmer Champion having missed out on her tournament opportunity, but still could not maintain a winning streak, falling victim to Rain and later her tag team partner Jetta. After being eliminated from a 20-woman Battle Royal to determine the Shimmer Championship contender during Volume 19, Serena pinpointed champion Sara Del Rey for her next match, but came up short. On Volume 21, Serena maintained she demanded another title match, blaming her loss on an injury. Sara Del Rey refused, calling her \\"bottom of the barrel\\" but an impromptu brawl turned into a sanctioned match, in which Serena once again put up a strong effort but lost. The event closed with Serena talking backstage about how the defeat would not stop her in trying to become champion at which point MsChif, the Shimmer Champion, commended her drive and ambition and offered her a match on the condition of beating Del Rey. At Volume 22 Del Rey's manager, Larry Sweeney, announced she did not need to face Serena having beaten her twice already and that Del Rey's only goal was to reclaim the Shimmer Championship. After the main event closed, Del Rey hit the ring and attacked MsChif until Serena appeared to fight in MsChif's corner; the referee quickly declared their impromptu bout another match where, after taking yet another severe beating, Serena finally managed to defeat Del Rey. After another post-match assault, MsChif came to save Serena making the event end with the Shimmer Champion raising Serena's hand. Despite a storied build up over the years, including a seldom used video package to hype the main event, Serena was unsuccessful in her match. Though she failed to win her title match, it seemed her rivalry with Del Rey wasn't over. As well as bouncing back over Cat Power, she had a competitive victory over Mercedes Martinez. After her match, Del Rey and Amazing Kong had a Shimmer Tag Team Championship shot against Ashley Lane and Nevaeh, which ended when they started using chairs against the champions. Despite having just wrestled, Martinez assisted Serena in clearing the ring and keeping Del Rey at bay. Their attempts at Volume 26 to form a successful tag team saw them come undone against Del Rey and Kong's brutish power.  Wrestlicious (2009)  Also in early 2009, Serena appeared in the fledgling all-female Wrestlicious promotion. In the camp show, Take Down she was known as \\"Webmistress\\" Paige Webb and debuted on the second episode of their television show which, while being recorded in early 2009, was not broadcast until March 2010 after she had begun to appear in WWE. In her first singles match she lost to \\"Ice Princess\\" Autumn Frost and won her first match on the fifth episode, where she teamed with Charlotte to take on the team of Hope and Faith.  World Wrestling Entertainment  On the May 19, 2009 episode of World Wrestling Entertainment's ECW on Sci Fi, Serena was seen standing backstage while Finlay was walking to the ring. Though Serena initially denied she signed with WWE, Shimmer promoter Dave Prazak confirmed that a contract had been negotiated on July 1, 2009. = Florida Championship Wrestling (2009‚Äì2010) = Serena made her debut on July 15, 2009 at a Florida Championship Wrestling house show where she teamed with Maria and Angela Fong to win against the team of Natalya, Layla and Alicia Fox in a six Diva Tag match. In her televised debut match, Serena defeated Layla. Her ring name was soon changed to Serena Mancini and once again to Mia Mancini, portraying the character of a mafia boss's daughter. On 14 August, Mancini pinned April Lee in a four-way match during the TV taping for FCW's fiftieth episode to win a future opportunity to compete against Angela for her Queen of FCW crown. She followed up on September 3, though it would not air until October 4, with a win over Angela to become the second Queen of FCW. While defending her crown, Mancini began taking on WWE Divas from the televised roster, defeating Tiffany, Natalya, Savannah and Gail Kim. Later in September, Mancini was involved in a backstage segment which was unacknowledged by the commentary team where a mysterious man told her to lose her match against Angela, though she would refuse to. At the February 4, 2010 FCW television tapings, AJ Lee defeated Serena, who incorporated her SmackDown character into the Mancini role, to become the new Queen of FCW. When Matt Martlaro announced that there would be a creation of the FCW Divas Championship, Serena competed in the tournament to determine the inaugural Champion, during which she defeated Aksana and AJ Lee en route to the final where she was defeated by Naomi Night. = The Straight Edge Society (2010) = The Straight Edge Society (left to right): Serena, CM Punk and Luke Gallows On the January 22, 2010 edition of SmackDown, Serena appeared, playing the part of an audience member, before jumping over the crowd barrier to join CM Punk's group of straight edge followers; as part of the initiation, she agreed to have her head shaved bald. In a later podcast interview with wrestling journalist Brady Hicks, Serena said of the head shaving: \\"It was a really unique opportunity. Seeing a woman getting her head shaved was so rare, you don't see it all that often in the history of wrestling. Getting to do it as my debut was really, really cool, and really powerful. I was also very scared about what I was going to look like. There were a lot of uncertainties, but it ended up being really, really great for my career.\\" One week later, she reappeared with Punk and Luke Gallows, now as a member of villainous group the Straight Edge Society, for their match against D-Generation X for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship. However, Theodore Long changed the title match and instead set up a singles match between Punk and Triple H, during which she and Gallows attacked Triple H, disqualifying Punk in the process. On the July 2, 2010 edition of SmackDown, Serena unwillingly showed video security footage of her drinking alcohol at a bar as an alibi for Punk's whereabouts, raising the ire of The Society; she was forgiven by Punk the next week, though Gallows showed signs of disapproval. This incident was the first of many signs of trouble within the group, leading to Serena's first and only televised match in WWE on August 20 (taped August 17). In a match where she and Gallows would be expelled from The Society if they lost, the duo took on Big Show and Kelly Kelly in a mixed tag team match, where Serena used a gutbuster to pin Kelly. On August 20, Serena was released from her WWE contract, reportedly for not \\"living out\\" her straight edge persona in public. Because SmackDown was pre-recorded, her release was not revealed immediately, which gave her one last appearance, airing on August 27 as a valet to Punk and Gallows in separate matches.  Return to Shimmer (2010‚Äì2011; 2013)  On September 11, 2010 at the Volume 33 taping for Shimmer, Serena made a surprise return to the promotion, answering Kellie Skater's open challenge and defeating her in a singles match. She then had a verbal confrontation with former partner Portia Perez who accused her of selling out by going to WWE which led to a match at Volume 35 where Serena submitted to a crossface after the referee was distracted from seeing Serena reaching the ropes. She then rekindled her rivalry with Sara Del Rey, who made a speech criticizing her, leading to Serena main eventing Volume 36 in a Four- on-Four Tag Team Elimination match where Serena was eliminated second after Tomoka Nakagawa. In March 2011, Serena defeated Daizee Haze on Volume 37 and was victorious in a tag team match on Volume 38. Serena continued her rivalry with Portia Perez on Volume 39, defeating her via DQ. On Volume 40, Serena defeated Portia Perez, Cheerleader Melissa, and LuFisto in a four corner survival match to earn a shot at the Shimmer Championship. She got her shot on Volume 41 in October but was defeated by Madison Eagles. Serena lost to Nicole Matthews on Volume 42 after interference from Portia Perez. Serena finished her rivalry with Portia on Volume 43 by defeating her in a no holds barred match. After 18 months off due to injury, Serena made her return for Shimmer Women Athletes as part of WrestleCon on April 6, 2013. In her return match at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view, Serena teamed with Allison Danger and Leva Bates to defeat The Midwest Militia (Jessicka Havok, Nevaeh and Sassy Stephie) in a six-woman tag team match, pinning Nevaeh for the win. Afterwards, Serena was attacked by Havok.  Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2015)  Due to Shimmer's working relationship with Ring of Honor (ROH), Serena began to make occasional appearances for ROH in 2007 as part of February's Fifth Year Festival, she teamed up with MsChif in a losing effort to the Dangerous Angels (Danger and Del Rey). In the middle of the year she was similarly unsuccessful against Lacey at United We Stand and afterwards received a beating from her Age of The Fall partners Rain and Jimmy Jacobs until Haze saved her. She also came out on the losing end of a Shimmer guest match at 2008's Southern Hostility in a four corner survival match. She returned to ROH for their year-end internet pay-per-view Final Battle 2010 teaming with long-term rival Del Rey against Daizee Haze and Amazing Kong, winning the match after taking out Kong with a spear to let Del Rey pin Haze. Serena appeared at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's pay-per-view Slammiversary in June 2008, where she took part in Awesome Kong's $25,000 Fan Challenge in a three-minute squash match, as did fellow OVW and Shimmer wrestler Josie, who signed a contract with the company. In November 2008 at a Pro Wrestling Syndicate show, Serena wrestled Daffney for the vacant NWA France Women's Championship, which she won. After winning the title, Serena travelled to France to defend the title under the International Catch Wrestling Alliance the following month. At Revolution V in Lille, she defended the title against three-time champion Bella Punk. Despite landing her Spear finisher, Punk's accomplice Gangrel turned the lights out in the arena from which Punk took advantage and pinned Serena after a spike DDT. Serena accompanied Joe E. Legend in the main event against Gangrel, which the latter won. Serena Deeb wrestling at Paris in March 2009 Serena found herself back in France during March 2009 for American Wrestling Rampage's nine-day tour of France. For most of the events, Serena wrestled fellow Shimmer wrestler Portia Perez, who was the only other woman on the tour. After two losses, Serena managed to pick up a victory but would only gain one more from their eight singles matches. On the final night, she teamed up with Scotty The Hotty to gain a third victory over Perez and Chris Masters in a tag team match. In November 2010, Serena debuted for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU), and established herself as a villainess by cutting a promo stating that she should be handed a title shot because she was in WWE. Serena would later gain a victory over Traci Brooks on WSU's first internet pay-per-view (iPPV). Serena followed up by winning a Four Way match over Alicia, Portia Perez and Jana to become number one contender to the WSU Championship. Deeb would target WSU Champion Mercedes Martinez by attacking her after a title defense late that evening and cutting some of Martinez's hair. Serena received her title shot in the main event of WSU's 4 Year Anniversary show where she was defeated by Mercedes.

She remained undefeated by beating Makoto on Smash.13, Kana on Smash.17, Tomoka Nakagawa on Smash.19 in the first round and Syuri on Smash.20 in the semifinals of a tournament for the Smash Diva Championship. On September 8, Serena suffered her first loss in Smash, when she was defeated by Kana in the finals of a tournament to crown the first ever Smash Diva Champion.

It was enacted in response to two incidents involving the deaths of 22 children who had contracted tetanus from contaminated vaccines. This law paved the way for further regulation of drug products under the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. Biologics control is now under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). History U.S. Marine Hospital Service at Stapleton, Staten Island, New York. From 1887 to 1891, the Laboratory was located in the attic of the Marine Hospital on Staten Island. When the large scale production of vaccines began in the late 19th century, the United States had no government regulations on biological products. In 1901, a 5-year-old girl died of tetanus in St. Louis, Missouri after being given a diphtheria anti-toxin. Investigations found that the St. Louis Board of Health produced the contaminated vaccine using the blood of a horse infected with tetanus. While the infected horse, Jim, was killed, the Board of Health continued to use the serum to treat diphtheria. It was later discovered that 12 other children had died from the same contaminated vaccines in St. Louis. That same year, 9 children in Camden, New Jersey died from contaminated smallpox vaccines. These incidents led the Hygienic Laboratory and the Medical Society of the District of Columbia to propose a law regulating the production of biological products. On July 1, 1902, Congress passed the Biologics Control Act.  Contents of the Act  The Biologics Control Act established a board to oversee the implementation of regulations of biological products. The board consisted of the Surgeon-General of the Army, the Surgeon-General of the Navy, and the Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital Service, and was to be overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury. This board was given the power to issue, suspend, and revoke licenses to produce and sell biological products. The Biologics Control Act also mandated that all products be labeled accurately with the name of the product and the address and license number of the manufacturer. Laboratories could be subjected to unannounced inspections by the Treasury Department. The punishment for the violation of this law was a fine of up to $500 or up to a year in prison.  Institutions  The Laboratory of Hygiene of the Marine Hospital Service, established on Staten Island, NY, in 1887, was in charge of testing biologics before the Biologics Control Act. It was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1891, and renamed the Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in 1902. The Hygienic Laboratory was responsible for renewing licenses annually, testing products, and performing inspections. In 1930, the Ransdell Act transformed the Hygienic Laboratory into the National Institute of Health and gave it a larger role in public health research. In 1948, the name was changed again to the National Institutes of Health, as it encompassed many institutes and centers dedicated to biomedical research. In 1972, biologics regulation was moved to the Food and Drug Administration and later became known as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).  Impact  The Biologics Control Act set a precedent for the federal regulation of biologics such as vaccines and blood components. With the development of biotechnology, the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has taken a larger role in reviewing and approving new biological products intended for medical purposes, including probiotics, xenotransplantation and gene therapy.

Tellenbach also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of the medieval nobility and helped establish a new field of research dedicated to mapping social networks and familial ties among medieval elites (Personenforschung). After studying history at the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg, he taught in Gie√üen, M√ºnster, and finally the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t in Freiburg, where he served as Rektor (chancellor) in 1949‚Äì1950 and again in 1957‚Äì1958. From 1962 to 1971, he was director of the German Historical Institute in Rome, a state-sponsored research center dedicated to German-Italian studies and the history of the Papacy in the Middle Ages. Scholarly influence Given his extraordinarily long and productive career, Tellenbach ranks as one of the most influential German historians of the twentieth century. At Freiburg, as well as during his tenure as director of the German Historical Institute in Rome, he trained and served as a mentor to a large number of students of medieval history who went on to receive important academic chairs throughout Germany. His most famous student was Karl Schmid (1923‚Äì1993), who further developed Tellenbach's research on medieval noble families and pioneered important new techniques in prosopography and source criticism using monastic necrologies and memorial books. Tellenbach's intellectual formation before World War I, and his scholarly maturation following the catastrophe of the Second World War, also lent his scholarship a unique perspective. Tellenbach's research in church history, as well as in political and social history, broke with long-standing nationalistic and highly confessional and politicized accounts and instead stressed long-term structural changes as well as intellectual and cultural forces in society. His conception of the Investiture Controversy as an epochal clash of opposing ideologies about \\"right order in the world,\\" (hierocratic vs. monarchic) was certainly formed as a young scholar witnessing the vicious political conflicts that engulfed the universities in the 1930s and 1940s. Throughout his career, and particularly in his publicly visible role as university Rektor, he remained a thoughtful and forceful advocate of academic and intellectual freedom as critical components of liberal democracy. His brother, Reinhard Tellenbach, a very successful surgeon in Munich, has created a wonderful exhibition about his brothers' life and work. He lives in Munich with his wife and their three children Christina, Stefan and Anna. Selected works *Libertas.

The novel's genre is not easily classifiable but has elements of horror, thriller and new age mysticism about it, together with some coherent themes interlaced regarding consumerism, the environment, the sacredness of nature and the pitfalls of religious faith.  Plot summary Aaron, a wealthy amateur scholar, hires sexagenarian private investigator Howard, whom he meets at a chess club in Chicago to which they both belong, to investigate the gods Baal, Ashtoroth and Moloch, that were worshipped for centuries in Israel during a period of antiquity when the God of Abraham had fallen into disfavor. As Aaron says to Howard while proposing the task, referring to story of Exodus of the Old Testament: Although Howard initially turns down the case, thinking Aaron is either crazy or a fool, Aaron is dogged, and increases his offer of reward until Howard eventually relents. However, Howard only agrees to work on the problem for one month to test whether any inroads can be made into the peculiar case. It is indeed a problem ‚Äî how to even begin investigating a trail that is centuries cold. Howard turns to a psychic for help, who using a Tarot card reading, sets Howard on a path which leads him to a young boy named Tim from Indiana, in whom the gods have taken an interest. Tim's father, who was in the midst of a mid-life crisis, has recently disappeared. Howard helps Tim in his quest to locate and determine what has become of his father. In their quest they are dogged by supernatural events that are eventually revealed as the workings of the gods who may be \\"false,\\" but who are, nevertheless, real.

In 1806, he moved to Sheldon, New York with his family, He attended the common schools and Middlebury Academy located in the village of Wyoming, New York before serving as a teacher at the Academy. He became inspector of the common schools, and in 1825, he served as the deputy sheriff of Le Roy, New York. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1827. He began the practice of law in Le Roy and served as supervisor of Le Roy in 1830. Political career In 1832, he served as a Whig member of the New York State Assembly. He declined to be a candidate for renomination. He was elected as an antislavery member of the twenty-sixth and twenty seventh U. S. Congresses, serving from March 4, 1839 to March 3, 1843. While in Congress, he drafted the protest signed by the Whigs in Congress against the annexation of Texas. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection. In 1843, he moved to Warsaw, New York, and continued the practice of law. He was also engaged in the lumber trade and a merchant. In 1848, on the Barnburners and Free Soil ticket, and in 1852, on the Free Democratic ticket, he was twice an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York. Due to his pronounced hostility to slavery, a southern planter offered $500 for his apprehension. From 1851-1865, he was the secretary of the Wyoming County Insurance Company. In 1861, he was appointed postmaster at Warsaw, serving until 1870. Death and legacy Gates died on August 24, 1877 in Warsaw, and is interred in Warsaw Cemetery. His home, the Seth M. Gates House, at Warsaw, New York was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

The district serves most of Lake Township (including the village of Hartville) except for the southwestern quarter of the township, which is served by the North Canton City School District. The district also serves very small portions of Marlboro Township, and Suffield Township in Portage County. The schools in this district include: Lake High School, Lake Middle School, Lake Elementary, Hartville Elementary, and Uniontown Elementary. The superintendent of the Lake Local School District is Kevin Tobin.  Bond Issue 14  On Tuesday, May 5, 2015, the voters of Lake township passed Lake Local Schools Issue 14. The issue passed with voter counts of 2,922 votes yes and 2,509 votes no. Including 44 voters who abstained, overall turnout was 39.4% of the township electorate. The levy was proposed as a $34.6 million bond issue over 36 years. Included with the bond were two operating levies:a $1.5 million permanent levy and a $.5 million continuous levy. Homeowners would pay $221 in additional taxes if they owned a $100,000 home, which would result in approximately $2.5 million in new revenue for the school district.  Structural Deficiencies  Hartville Elementary was 93 years old in 2015 and structurally deficient to contemporary standards. Lake Elementary, attached to Hartville, would need to be replaced in conjunction. At the middle school building, issues included air quality, the dissolving conditions of the supporting west wall, and other logistical issues caused by the design of the then 36-year-old building. The repairs of such issues would cost approximately $14 million and a replacement of the school comparatively $21 million. Project architects believe that the levy is justified by state standards which suggest a school should be replaced when renovation costs are two thirds or greater of the replacement cost. The high school requires $15 million in renovations. These come after a 1999 construction project that largely focused on the high school and not the middle school. A replacement of the high school at the time of the bond issue was $39 million.  Proposed Building improvements  The district will restructure its schools and the grades they will contain. Lake Elementary and Hartville Elementary will be combined into a single school containing grades 2‚Äì6. Uniontown Elementary will house the districts k-2 school. The high school will now include 7th and 8th grades. Uniontown Elementary will be receiving a 9,700 square foot addition and 49,000 square feet of complete renovation of the current building. The additions at Uniontown include a new gymnasium, media center, and lunchroom. The new 2-6 building includes a 135,000 square foot addition and will receive a new mailing address. The 7-12 building will feature 64,000 square feet of renovations and 110,123 square feet of additions.  Funding Issues  Officials of the campaign to pass bond issue 14 promoted the issue believing $58 million of Ohio School Facilities Commission would be coming from a tobacco company lawsuit from 2007. The settlement in 2007 resulted in $4.1 billion for the commission. A spokesman for Ohio Facilities Construction Commission confirmed that these funds were exhausted in fiscal year 2011, four years prior to the passage of bond issue 14. The spokeswoman for Lake Local schools Karen Koch claimed after that the school wouldn't have promoted the tobacco lawsuit money if they had known it wasn't available. The funding for the project would come from state dollars, now backed by bonds sold by the Ohio general revenue fund and money allocated by legislators. > ‚ÄúWe had no idea whatsoever... Back in 2009 and 2011 when the schools tried > to pass those bond issues, that (tobacco settlement) money was there, (We) > were not aware that the money was not still available in 2015...

The district currently consists of one 9-12 grade high school, one 4-8 grade middle school, and three K-3 grade neighborhood elementary schools. The Massillon City School District is one of five school districts located in and around the city of Massillon. History In 1848 the citizens of Massillon passed a school levy to build the first public school in the city called Union School. With the growth of the city due to the canal port and the arrival of the railroad, a second school was built on the city's west side called West Massillon Union School in 1866. With more people moving to the city in search of jobs, more schools were constructed to accommodate the influx of children into the city. Cherry Street Elementary was built in 1881, West Main School in 1884, Lincoln Elementary school in 1888, and State Street School in 1896. In 1894, Massillon Union High School played its first football game against Canton Central High School. The football team mascot became the Tigers, the same mascot used by the Massillon Tigers professional club team. The Massillon Tigers would celebrate their first undefeated season in 1909. Oak Park elementary school was built in 1901 and was renamed Emerson Elementary in 1913, and Harvey Elementary school was built in 1910. In 1912 a new high school was built near downtown and was named Washington High School in honor of the country's first president. In 1915, West Brookfield School (constructed in 1905) located on the city's far west side became part of the Massillon city school district. Edmund A. Jones Junior High School and Horace Mann Elementary School were both opened in 1920, and Lorin Andrews Junior High (named for Lorin Andrews) and Longfellow Junior High School (site of the original Union School) opened in 1923. In 1929, Vinedale School located on the city's far east side (built in 1905) became part of the Massillon school district and was renamed Lewis E. York Elementary School. Lewis E. York Elementary was replaced with a new building in 1939, along with the construction of Whittier Elementary (replacing the State Street school) and a new building replacing the original Emerson Elementary school. The year 1939 was also the year a new 18,000 seat football stadium was constructed on the city's east side to accommodate the success of the Massillon Tiger football team, which was coached by Paul Brown during this period. The stadium was named Tiger Stadium, replacing Massillon Athletic Field built and dedicated in 1924 with Paul Brown in attendance as a Junior QB on Massillon team. The stadium was renamed Paul Brown Tiger Stadium in 1976 in honor of Paul Brown. In 1957, Franklin Elementary and Gorrell Elementary schools were built. A new Lincoln Elementary school building was built in 1958, and Bowers Elementary school was built in 1965 on the city's far west side replacing the West Brookfield school. L. J. Smith Elementary was built in 1966. The 1970s and 80s was a trying time for the city and the school district, when the city experienced a steep decline in its manufacturing and steel industry. The first downsizing of district school buildings in the history of the school system resulted in the closing of Horace Mann elementary school in 1974, Jones Junior High School in 1980, and both Harvey and Lincoln elementary schools in 1981. The 1990s was the start of a new era in the Massillon City School District with voters passing a levy in 1991 to construct a new Washington High School next to Paul Brown Tiger Stadium on the city's east side. Voters approved another levy in 2005 to construct a new 5-8th grade middle school on the city's west side, replacing both Longfellow and Lorin Andrew Junior High Schools. However, in 2012 the school district closed three elementary schools: Bowers, Emerson, and Smith. Along with Washington High School and the new Massillon Middle School, the district continues to operate three elementary schools: Franklin, Whittier, and Gorrell. Massillon Middle Middle School Changed into a 4th-6th grade Intermediate School and a 7th-8th Jr. High School.

On the 6th of September of 2018, the province became the √ëuble Region. History The √ëuble province was created in 1848 with the San Carlos Department of Maule Province and Chill√°n Department of Concepci√≥n Province. In 1884, the departments of Bulnes and Yungay, were created from the Chill√°n Department. In 1927, the provincial limits were modified and the Itata Department was added from Maule. Later, in 1976, the communes of Coelemu and R√°nquil from Concepci√≥n Province, and the commune of Tucapel from B√≠o B√≠o Province, were added. Following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami, at least eight small communities and two towns were abandoned by residents, who took up makeshift camps in the hills, fearful of further tsunamis. Over 800 residences in the town of Quirihue were destroyed, leaving little for townspeople to return to. In 2015 the √ëuble Region law which converts the √ëuble Province into a Region, was proposed. In August 2017 a law to create the new territorial division was promulgated by the President of the Republic in Chill√°n. It became operational on 6 September 2018.

Expectation It can be shown that :\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon\\\\right]=\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left[\\\\Lambda \\\\Sigma\\\\right] + \\\\mu^T\\\\Lambda\\\\mu where \\\\mu and \\\\Sigma are the expected value and variance-covariance matrix of \\\\varepsilon, respectively, and tr denotes the trace of a matrix. This result only depends on the existence of \\\\mu and \\\\Sigma; in particular, normality of \\\\varepsilon is not required. A book treatment of the topic of quadratic forms in random variables is that of Mathai and Provost.  Proof  Since the quadratic form is a scalar quantity, \\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon). Next, by the cyclic property of the trace operator, : \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon)] = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon\\\\varepsilon^T)]. Since the trace operator is a linear combination of the components of the matrix, it therefore follows from the linearity of the expectation operator that : \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon\\\\varepsilon^T)] = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\varepsilon\\\\varepsilon^T)). A standard property of variances then tells us that this is : \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda (\\\\Sigma + \\\\mu \\\\mu^T)). Applying the cyclic property of the trace operator again, we get : \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda\\\\Sigma) + \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda \\\\mu \\\\mu^T) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda\\\\Sigma) + \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mu^T\\\\Lambda\\\\mu) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda\\\\Sigma) + \\\\mu^T\\\\Lambda\\\\mu. Variance in the Gaussian case In general, the variance of a quadratic form depends greatly on the distribution of \\\\varepsilon. However, if \\\\varepsilon does follow a multivariate normal distribution, the variance of the quadratic form becomes particularly tractable. Assume for the moment that \\\\Lambda is a symmetric matrix. Then, :\\\\operatorname{var} \\\\left[\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon\\\\right] = 2\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left[\\\\Lambda \\\\Sigma\\\\Lambda \\\\Sigma\\\\right] + 4\\\\mu^T\\\\Lambda\\\\Sigma\\\\Lambda\\\\mu . In fact, this can be generalized to find the covariance between two quadratic forms on the same \\\\varepsilon (once again, \\\\Lambda_1 and \\\\Lambda_2 must both be symmetric): :\\\\operatorname{cov}\\\\left[\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda_1\\\\varepsilon,\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda_2\\\\varepsilon\\\\right]=2\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left[\\\\Lambda _1\\\\Sigma\\\\Lambda_2 \\\\Sigma\\\\right] + 4\\\\mu^T\\\\Lambda_1\\\\Sigma\\\\Lambda_2\\\\mu. Computing the variance in the non-symmetric case Some texts incorrectly state that the above variance or covariance results hold without requiring \\\\Lambda to be symmetric. The case for general \\\\Lambda can be derived by noting that :\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda^T\\\\varepsilon=\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\Lambda\\\\varepsilon so :\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda}\\\\varepsilon=\\\\varepsilon^T\\\\left(\\\\Lambda+\\\\Lambda^T\\\\right)\\\\varepsilon/2 is a quadratic form in the symmetric matrix \\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda}=\\\\left(\\\\Lambda+\\\\Lambda^T\\\\right)/2, so the mean and variance expressions are the same, provided \\\\Lambda is replaced by \\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda} therein. Examples of quadratic forms In the setting where one has a set of observations y and an operator matrix H, then the residual sum of squares can be written as a quadratic form in y: :\\\\textrm{RSS}=y^T(I-H)^T (I-H)y. For procedures where the matrix H is symmetric and idempotent, and the errors are Gaussian with covariance matrix \\\\sigma^2I, \\\\textrm{RSS}/\\\\sigma^2 has a chi- squared distribution with k degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter \\\\lambda, where :k=\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left[(I-H)^T(I-H)\\\\right] :\\\\lambda=\\\\mu^T(I-H)^T(I-H)\\\\mu/2 may be found by matching the first two central moments of a noncentral chi-squared random variable to the expressions given in the first two sections.

This location, owned by Imperial Oil, includes a Tim Hortons drive-thru and an RBC bank machine. On the Run is a flagship convenience store brand developed by ExxonMobil, used at Exxon and Mobil stations in the United States, BP and Mobil in Australia and at Esso and Mobil stations internationally. Alimentation Couche-Tard acquired the On the Run trademark and franchise network in the U.S. in 2009, and Parkland Fuel did the same in Canada in 2016; ExxonMobil retains full ownership of the brand in the rest of the world. On the Run stores are described as larger and having more products than older-model convenience stores, featuring \\"fresh snacks, fill-in groceries, health & beauty supplies, plus quick meal options\\".http://www.esso.ca/Canada- English/Products/Fuels/PS_F_ConvenienceStores.asp The name \\"On the Run\\" is used, untranslated, around the world. Locations in the Canadian province of Quebec utilize similar branding as March√© Express; Imperial Oil faced criticism in 2007 when it planned to rebrand the locations as On the Run (beginning with a new location at a Mount Royal Esso station), but threats of boycotts by the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, as well as sanctions from the Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise (which enforces legal protections of the French language), caused the company to backtrack on this decision. Divestments On April 29, 2009, Canadian convenience store company Alimentation Couche-Tard, which operates stores in the United States under the Circle K name, acquired the 450-store On the Run franchise network (the stores themselves remain with local franchisees) plus 43 ExxonMobil-owned and operated stores in the Phoenix, Arizona area. In August 2011, 7-Eleven announced it was acquiring 51 ExxonMobil-owned and operated On the Run locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; the convenience stores were re- branded as 7-Eleven, but will still sell Exxon-branded gasoline. Houston-area On The Run locations (81 total) were rebranded either as a Timewise (Landmark Industries) or Star Stop (the retail division of Panjwani Energy LLC) convenience store since 7-Eleven does not operate franchises in the Houston Metro area. In 2016, Imperial Oil began to divest its retail locations in Canada; various Esso locations in Ontario and Quebec were sold to Couche-Tard (being rebranded as Circle K and Couche-Tard), and 7-Eleven acquired 148 locations in Alberta and British Columbia for $2.8 billion. Parkland Fuel acquired the remaining On the Run/March√© Express franchise network and associated trademarks in Canada, and has since begun to utilize the brand (including a refreshed version of the concept introduced 2018) in conjunction with its own retail brands (such as Pioneer).  Operations  On the Run has locations in over 1789 stores in 40 countries.  Australia  On The Run (abbreviated as OTR) is an umbrella brand of 24-hour convenience stores coupled with service stations owned and operated by the family-owned Peregrine Corporation. Peregrine founder Fred Shahin opened his first service station in 1984 and the company now owns over 160 sites across South Australia. Although the sites were originally branded Mobil, they initially switched to On the Run branding (with minor acknowledgement of selling Mobil fuels\\", then to OTR branding, with a switch to BP fuels. Many OTR outlets operate alongside other brands such as Subway, Brumby's Bakeries, Oporto and Wendy's. In 2018 the chain received significant criticism from consumers and environmental groups for a decision to ban reusable coffee cups, amongst growing concerns of the negative effect of the 1.2 billion disposable cups that end-up in landfill in Australia each year. Also in 2018, On The Run became the inaugural title sponsor of the Supercars Championship event The Bend SuperSprint at the Peregrine-owned The Bend Motorsport Park.  Ireland  Ireland has many On the Run stores. Most of them used to have a food company called Nine-One-One in them, but they were ordered by the High Court to withdraw in 32 stores.  United Kingdom  Esso's company-operated convenience stores in the UK were run through ROC UK,http://www.exxonmobil.com/UK- English/HRoc/HR_Roc_Homepage.asp a subsidiary of Esso Petroleum Company Limited and ExxonMobil. Initially branded Snack & Shop, the stores were gradually converted to the On The Run format after Exxon acquired Mobil. Between 2011 and 2015 Esso/ROC sold off 359 of its company outlets in regional tranches to three large independent operators - Euro Garages, MRH (GB), and Rontec, although it continued to supply them with Esso branded fuel through an independent wholesaler, Greenergy.Forecourt Trader, 15 January 2015 None of the new owners continued to use On the Run. Euro Garages mainly used third party names, notably Spar and - for food offerings - Greggs, Subway, Burger King and KFC; MRH used a mix of third party names and its own Hursts C-store branding; and Rontec initially mainly used its own Shop'n Drive name, but occasionally Spar and a discount format, Family Shopper. Esso retained ownership of around 200 sites that have Tesco Express stores where the site is leased to Tesco but sells Esso branded fuel.  Egypt  In Egypt, On the Run convenience stores are located at Mobil stations in Cairo, Giza and Alexandria. They are open 24 hours, 7 days a week. https://fuels.mobil.com.eg/our-stores  Awards  In 2003, On the Run was named Chain of the Year by Convenience Store Decisions (CSD) magazine.

Biography After having played for a few years with various English-speaking rock groups, Rudy Caya and Michel Vaillancourt decided to plunge into more Francophone waters by playing with Les Taches from 1982 to 1986. Determined to push this Francophile experience even further, they started their own band. Vilain Pingouin was born in Montreal in 1986 during a boom in Francophone rock music. Along with singer-songwriter Rudy Caya and drummer Michel Vaillancourt, the group included guitarist Rodolphe Fortier, harmonica player Claude Samson and bassist Fr√©d√©ric Bonicard. A few months after its formation, Vilain Pingouin performed in the spring 1987 Rock en Vol contest and at the first International Rock Festival in Montreal (FIRM). Audiences responded well to the band's enthusiastic, raw, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîoriginal music, which brought Vilain Pingouin to the finals of the L'Empire des Futures Stars contest the following year. In 1989, Vilain Pingouin recorded their first single, \\"Fran√ßois,\\" under the Audiogram label, to which the band has remained faithful throughout its career. \\"Fran√ßois\\" was a hit, remaining on MusiquePlus' rotation for twelve weeks. The same year another single, \\"Salut Salaud\\", propelled Vilain Pingouin to the top of the Radio-Activity charts. After completing its first provincial tour of Quebec, the group released its refreshing debut album, \\"Vilain Pingouin\\" on September 12, 1990. With tracks whose sounds evoked everything from U.S. country music to 60s pop, \\"Vilain Pingouin\\" transformed the Quebec music scene and achieved gold status in 1991. Several tracks, including \\"Sous la Pluie\\", \\"Les Belles Ann√©es\\" and \\"Marche Seul\\" became hits. Vilain Pingouin was named \\"Group of the Year\\" at ADISQ in 1991. The same year they also took home the awards for video of the year and best editing for \\"Marche Seul\\" at the first MusiquePlus Gala. Their self- titled album is often considered to be their most acclaimed and well-known. Riding a wave of popularity, Vilain Pingouin embarked on a major tour of over two hundred shows in Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick. Despite their hectic schedule, they still managed to record and release their second album, \\"Roche et Roule\\", in the fall of 1992. \\"Roche et Roule\\" was acclaimed as both more varied and more \\"authentic\\" than their previous work. Its songs ranged from the folksy \\"Passe-Moi le Celt\\" and \\"Chu tu Seul √† Soir\\", to jazz-influenced \\"Festin de Pingouins\\" and \\"Le Bleu de Papier Blanc\\", to the Cajun-accented \\"P'tite Vie, P'tite Mis√®re\\". The album won Vilain Pingouin many new fans and consolidated the band's popularity. In spring 1993, the group participated in the Rock Le Lait tour alongside Jean Leloup and France D'Amour and won the F√©lix \\"Album of the Year - rock\\" award at the ADISQ Gala. The same year, Vilain Pingouin's popularity crossed the Atlantic when \\"Roche et Roule\\" was released in France under the Boucherie Production label. In spring 1994, the band performed 15 concerts spread across \\"the six corners\\" of France. The \\"Tour de France\\" was a success, winning Vilain Pingouin both popular and critical acclaim in the country. With Vilain Pingouin at its peak, its members felt the need to relax and work on some personal projects. In November 1994, they announced that they would take a hiatus after a farewell show titled \\"Pingouins sur Glace\\" at Snatches Electric in December 1994. Rudy Caya took advantage of this pause to record a solo album, \\"Mourir de Rire,\\" in 1995, which included the single of the same name. Recorded with Claude Samson, the album demonstrated the creative energy of the band's leader. But when Vilain Pingouin's \\"Roche et Roule\\" went gold that same year, Caya gathered the band back together with all the original members except bassist Fred Bonicard, who was replaced by Michel Bertrand. The group released its third album \\"Y'√© Quelle Heure?\\" in spring 1998, featuring a more \\"heavy\\" sound. The band toured for a year and a half as part of the Rock Le Lait tour. The band's eclectic sound, influenced by jazz, hip-hop, reggae, and alternative music, once again attracted large crowds and frenzied fans. During the tour, guitarist Rodolphe Fortier and bassist Michel Bertrand were replaced by Alain Godmer and Michel Turcotte, respectively. History In 1982, singer/guitarist Rudy Caya and drummer Michel Vaillancourt, having previously played in a number of English- language bands, formed a Francophone band, Les Taches (\\"The Stains\\" in English). In 1986, they expanded, adding Rodolphe Fortier on guitar, Claude Samson on guitar and harmonica and Frederik Bonicard on bass. They called the new band Vilain Pingouin. In 1989, they released the song \\"Fran√ßois\\". The video for this song played for 12 weeks on MusiquePlus, a Canadian francophone music station. They followed it with a song called \\"Salut Salaud\\" which topped the charts. Line-Up The initial line-up of the band was: *Rudy Caya (Vocals, Guitar) *Fr√©d√©ric Bonicard (Bass) *Rodolphe Fortier (Guitar) *Michel Vaillancourt (Drums) *Claude Sampson (Mandoline, Harp, Accordion, Guitar) Bonicard left and was replaced by Michel Bertrand (Guitar). Later, Michel Bertrand and Rodolphe Fortier left the band, being replaced by Michel Turcotte and Alain Godmer. Michel Turcotte is now no longer with the band, with Michel B√©langer taking his place.

Created by Mike Mignola, John Arcudi and Guy Davis, Daimio first appeared in B.P.R.D.: The Dead #1 (December 2004). A formerly dead United States Marine, Daimio suffers from a curse that transforms him into a horrific jaguar-like creature. A version of Daimio appeared in the 2019 film reboot of Hellboy played by Daniel Dae Kim. Fictional character biography As revealed in the second issue of B.P.R.D.: The Universal Machine, Captain Ben Daimio was a Japanese-American who was the former leader of a squad of 8 U.S. Marines assigned to a rescue mission in the Bolivian jungle (numbered D16F8-4188) on June 10, 2001 to save the nuns apparently captured by a fundamentalist group called the True Path, though the True Path was a peaceful political group that never engaged in violent activities beforehand. The mission went awry when the true culprits, a native jaguar cult who murdered the nuns, attacked the group. Shortly thereafter, a shapeless entity made itself known and slaughtered them until only Daimio remained, the incident leading him to be severely scarred on the left side of his face. He then collapsed and died from his injuries, while he received horrific visions of a giant jaguar-like spirit who told Daimio that his new life was to begin. Three days later, Daimio's corpse was recovered and scheduled for autopsy. However, he returned to life just prior to the procedure, cutting his way out of his body bag. After a brief period of recovery, Daimio was transferred to The Pentagon's Special Ops and began acting as an informal consultant to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. In 2004 after Dr. Kate Corrigan and Abe Sapien requested leave during B.P.R.D.: The Dead Daimio left the Pentagon and joined the B.P.R.D as Field Team Commander. He spearheaded the relocation of the Bureau from Fairfield, Connecticut to the mothballed Center for Defense Research and Development in the Colorado mountains a secret facility he became aware of during his time in the Pentagon. The move was not without difficulties and Daimio's blunt attitude, callousness and preference for force over diplomacy caused friction within the team, particularly with Liz Sherman. Daimio still displays serious facial trauma from the events that killed him in 2001, including a gaping tear in his left cheek and missing left ear. It is unknown whether he has refused reconstructive surgery, or if such surgery has proved impossible due to his unclear medical status. After the events of The Dead, Daimio has begun undergoing medical treatments with an apparition he calls \\"Chinaman\\". These mysterious treatments seem linked to a bizarre, monkey-like specimen in a jar Daimio recovered that had once belonged to his grandmother, an Imperial Japanese agent known as The Crimson Lotus. The embalmed creature appears identical to one Daimio saw in his visions just before his death in the jungle. In B.P.R.D.: Killing Ground, after years of faithful service to the Bureau, Daimio's loyalty was called into question by Johann Kraus, who uncovered Daimio's relation to the Crimson Lotus and resulted in Daimio beginning to act erratically, which led to his supposed death by a mysterious invader who launched a rocket at his room. However, Daimio emerged from the flames as a monstrous, jaguar-like creature which twice attempted to kill Liz Sherman, but was thwarted first by Abe Sapien and Agent Devon, and then by Johann Kraus, whose ghostly spirit was in possession of a superhuman host at the time. However, before escaping, Daimio tore off the jaw of Kraus' host body, effectively killing it, but leaving Kraus' spirit unharmed. The final issue reveals that Daimio was changed by the jaguar spirit while he was in Bolivia, causing him to involuntarily transform into a were-jaguar at night. His treatments with the \\"Chinaman\\" were supposed to suppress this transformation, but eventually it became too strong and he could no longer contain it. It is also revealed that he caused all of the deaths inside B.P.R.D. headquarters during this mini-series, contrary to the initial belief that it was a rampaging wendigo. Guilt-ridden with his actions, Daimio is last seen in the Colorado wilderness, standing before the now released Wendigo, Daryl, as revealed in B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth: The Long Death, as Johann tracked him down to the Canadian wilderness. After having approached Daryl, Daimio lost control of his transformation and attacked the normally placid Wendigo in his were-jaguar form. This forced Daryl to fight back. After an extended fight, the were-jaguar walked away after having seemingly slain Daryl, only for the Wendigo to recover and launch a surprise attack. Daimio was killed by the Wendigo off-panel, though it is unknown if his spirit inhabits his killer. In other media Ben Daimio appeared first time in the Hellboy reboot where he was portrayed by Korean American actor Daniel Dae Kim. ReferencesExternal links * Hellboy Zone. Dark Horse Comics.

Despite a lack of any concurring scientific evidence, HEV light has sometimes been claimed to be a cause of age-related macular degeneration. Some sunglasses and beauty creams specifically block HEV, for added marketing value. Currently The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) report from 2019 supports the 2010 result on the toxicity of blue LED light (400-450nm spike) to the eye, which can lead to impaired vision. It highlights short term effects on the retina linked to intense exposure to blue LED light, and long term effects linked to the onset of age-related macular degeneration. Harvard Health Publishing additionally asserts that exposure to blue light (especially blue LED light, but also broad-spectrum blue light), at night, has a stronger negative effect on sleep. This is also supported by the American Medical Association in a June 14, 2016 press release, which concludes that there are negative health impacts from the unrestrained use of LED street lighting in general.  Background  Blue light is a range of the visible light spectrum, defined as having a wavelength between 400‚àí525 nm. This includes wavelengths between violet and cyan in the spectrum. Narrow-spectrum blue light (a.k.a. blue LED light, or short-wavelength light) is a type of high-energy visible light, defined as having a wavelength between 400 and 450 nm. This light is common in LEDs (even when used in illumination products, unfortunately) as a carry-over from computer screen technology. Blue light is an essential component of white light. White can be made from either narrow-spectrum or broad-spectrum blue. For example, LED technology tends to combine narrow- spectrum blue and yellow, while other technologies include more cyan and red. Fluorescent coatings generate violet and cyan spikes, in addition to having a smaller narrow-spectrum blue component. Natural light has a much more even distribution of blue wavelengths than most artificial light.  Blue LED light  Blue light, a type of high-energy light, is part of the visible light spectrum Blue LED light sources are becoming increasingly common in today's environment. Exposure to blue light comes from a variety of technologies including computers, televisions, and lights. Much of the harmful exposure arises from light emitting diodes (LEDs). Today, many white LEDs are produced by pairing a blue LED with a lower-energy phosphor, thereby creating solid- state light (SSL). This is often considered ‚Äúthe next generation of illumination‚Äù as SSL technology dramatically reduces energy resource requirements.US. Department of energy. (2013). Solid-State Lighting Technology Fact Sheet (Optical Safety of LEDs). Available at: https://www.lightingglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf- manager/82_opticalsafety_fact-sheet.pdf Increasingly, people are exposed to blue LED light via everyday technology. The 2015 Pew Research Center study found that 68% of U.S. adults own a smartphone and 45% own a tablet. The study also found that levels of technology ownership vary by age; 86% of Americans 18-29 and 83% of those 30-49 own smartphones. Younger Americans also use high rates of blue light technologies. The survey of Common Sense Media in 2013 also demonstrated that 72% of children age 0‚Äì8 years old used mobile devices for watching videos and playing games. Moreover, 93% of teens owned a computer or had access to one at home. In contrast, computer ownership rates are lower for older Americans. Concerns regarding prolonged exposure to blue LED light= On eye health  Blue-light hazard is the potential for photochemically-induced retinal injury resulting from electromagnetic radiation-exposure at wavelengths primarily between 400 and Researchers have not studied the phenomenon in humans, but only (and inconclusively) in some rodent, primate, and in vitro studies. Photochemically-induced retinal injury is caused by the absorption of light by photoreceptors in the eye. Under normal conditions, when light hits a photoreceptor, the cell bleaches and becomes useless until it has recovered through a metabolic process called the visual cycle. Absorption of blue light, however, has been shown in rats and in a susceptible strain of mice to cause a problem in the process so that cells become unbleached and responsive again to light before they are ready. At wavelengths of blue light below 430 nm this greatly increases the potential for oxidative damage. For blue-light circadian therapy, harm is minimized by employing blue light at the near-green end of the blue spectrum. \\"1-2 min of 408 nm and 25 minutes of 430 nm are sufficient to cause irreversible death of photoreceptors and lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. [...] The action spectrum of light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells was found to peak at approximately 450 nm, a range with lower damage potential, yet not completely outside the damaging range.\\" A 2014 study found that LEDs cause retinal damage even in settings where they are used indirectly, such as in household light- bulbs. One study has given more insight into the blue-light hazard: permanent damage to the eye cells, as reported by a research-team from Toledo University The CIE published its position on the low risk of blue-light hazard resulting from the use LED technology in general lighting bulbs in April 2019 Concerns regarding blue LEDs are related to the difference between the photopic luminous flux and radiometric radiance. Photometry is concerned with the study of human perception of visible light, while radiometry is concerned with the measurement of energy. At the outer edges of the range of light perception, the amount of energy as light required to register as a perception increases. The perception of the brightness of different frequencies of light is defined according to the CIE luminosity function V(Œª). The peak efficiency of light perception is defined at 555 nm, having a value of V(Œª)=1. Blue LEDs, particularly those used in white LEDs, operate at around 450 nm, where V(Œª)=0.038. This means that blue light at 450 nm requires more than 26 times the radiometric energy for one to perceive the same luminous flux as green light at 555 nm. For comparison, UV-A at 380 nm (V(Œª)=0.000 039) requires 25 641 times the amount of radiometric energy to be perceived at the same intensity as green, three orders of magnitude greater than blue LEDs. Studies often compare animal trials using identical luminous flux rather than radiance meaning comparative levels of perceived light at different frequencies rather than total emitted energy. As interest in LED backlighting has increased, so has the technology developed. Studies often select low-quality generic LEDs from little-known brands with a high proportion of blue light, especially selecting low CRI LEDs which are not suitable for either lighting or backlight technologies. LCD screens and LED lighting generally use much higher CRI LEDs as consumers demand accurate color reproduction. White LEDs are designed to emulate natural sunlight as closely as is economically and technologically possible. Natural sunlight has a relatively high spectral density of blue light making exposure to relatively high levels of blue light not a new or unique phenomenon despite the relatively recent emergence of LED display technologies. IOLs (Intraocular lenses) are the ideal test model in-vivo on human models. They cannot be removed and are persistently active 24/7 owing to the fact that they are permanently implanted into the eye. A Cochrane Review found no evidence of any effect in 51 trials with yellow tinted intraocular implants. None of the studies reviewed provided any reliable statistical evidence to suggest any effect regarding contrast sensitivity, macular degeneration, vision, color-discrimination or sleep disturbances. A particular study claimed a large difference in observed fluorescein angiography examinations concluding they observed markedly less \\"progression of abnormal fundus autofluorescence\\" however the authors failed to discuss the fact that the excitation beam is filtered light between 465-490 nm, is largely blocked by blue light filtering IOLs but not clear IOLs present in the control patients. =Aggressive marketing = Aggressive advertisements may contribute to the public perception of the dangers of blue light. A sponsored post on NewGradOptometry promoted sales training from Essilor and their product range (including the moral benefits), then segued into the amoral nature of upselling unnecessary lenses, finishing by arguing that patients will go blind without blue-filtering lenses. Essilor provided a pair of free glasses to a fashion blogger who did not need prescription glasses but nonetheless quoted a large number of Essilor marketing pitches including the blindness-preventing promises of their blue-light filtering technology. The Essilor website claims that one may experience vision loss without their special filtering lenses, whether one requires prescription glasses or not. Zeiss offers a similar product yet does not make nearly as extreme claims. The UK's General Optical Council has criticised Boots Opticians for their unsubstantiated claims regarding their line of blue-light filtering lenses; and the Advertising Standards Authority fined them ¬£40,000. Boots Opticians sold the lenses for a ¬£20 markup. Trevor Warburton, speaking on behalf of the UK Association of Optometrists stated: \\"...current evidence does not support making claims that they prevent eye disease.\\" Despite the problem of deceptive marketing practices, the aforementioned ANSES report, from 2019, \\" highlights [the] disruptive effects to biological rhythms and sleep, linked to exposure to even very low levels of blue light in the evening or at night, particularly via screens\\", thus there are legitimate concerns as to the unconstrained use of LED lighting. Apple's and Microsoft's operating systems include options to reduce blue-light emissions by adjusting color temperature to a warmer gamut. These settings dramatically reduce the color gamut of the display, Much of this marketing fails to distinguish between the sharp, 400-450nm blue spike in mainstream LED bulbs, versus the broad-spectrum blue (up to 525nm cyan) present in other lighting technologies (including pre-LED technologies, and very new, cyan-rich LED technologies that go beyond the older CRI metrics), and natural light. Benefits of broad-spectrum blue light Broad-spectrum blue light (for example, including cyan wavelengths, such as in natural light or most fluorescent lights) is essential to wakefulness. Because it stimulates melanopsin receptors in the eye. This suppresses daytime melatonin, enabling wakefulness. Working in blue-free light (aka yellow light) for long periods of time disrupts circadian patterns because there is no melatonin suppression during the day, and reduced melatonin rebound at night. Dermatology Blue light within the range 400-450 nm has been reported in a number of studies to be effective as local treatment of eczema and psoriasis, as it purportedly helps dampen the immune response. Recent studies have also shown improvement of facial acne upon exposure to a LED emitting at 414 nm. A combination of exposure to red and blue lights is used more and more in clinical dermatologic therapies. Constructors such as Philips currently develop devices and techniques emitting in the blue visible spectrum to be used in dermatologic therapy.

Edwards, Jr., Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 (2004), p. 199 Imperial overstretch, also known as Imperial overreach, is a hypothesis which suggests that an empire can extend itself beyond its ability to maintain or expand its military and economic commitments. Arguably, this was true of the Roman Empire, which was strong and effective in the first and early second centuries CE, despite a few setbacks (Germany in 9CE; Scotland in the 80s CE) but lost territories (e.g. Dacia and Mesopotamia) after that and could not keep the Saxons, Huns and other 'barbarians' out in the 4th and 5th centuries. Clearly, this was true of the Napoleonic Empire, which made rapid gains by conquest in the first decade after Napoleon became dictator of France, but became over- extended militarily when it attempted to conquer Russia in 1812. Likewise the German Reich in 1942. The idea was popularised by Yale University historian Paul Kennedy in his 1987 book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.  Criticism  Paul Kennedy's view has been criticised from many directions, including the postmodern historiographer Hayden White,Western Journal of Communication, 56 (Fall 1992), 372-393, The Rhetoric of American Decline: Paul Kennedy, Conservatives, and the Solvency Debate, KENNETH S.

H Block of the Forth Street Campus Otago Polytechnic provides career-focused education and training, offering a range of New Zealand accredited postgraduate qualifications, degrees, diplomas and certificates at levels 2‚Äì10. History Otago Polytechnic traces its ancestry back to the Dunedin Technical School, which was established in 1889 to provide evening classes for working people. In 1909 it expanded to offer day classes for secondary school pupils. In 1914 the name was changed to the King Edward Technical College. In 1921 the college took over the Dunedin School of Art, which was New Zealand's first art school established in 1870. The college expanded further by taking on the evening and day time education of apprentices, technicians and professionals. In 1966 the college was split into a secondary school (later renamed Logan Park High School) and Otago Polytechnic, which opened on 1 February 1966. On 1 April 2020, Otago Polytechnic was subsumed into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs). Locations Otago Polytechnic is spread over a large geographical area with campuses in Dunedin and Central Otago, as well as a campus for international students in Auckland. The Polytechnic also carries out distance- based learning in areas ranging from Veterinary Nursing to Midwifery, work- based learning for mature students through Capable NZ and an online micro- credentialing service called EduBits. Dunedin campuses thumb The Dunedin campus is situated on Forth Street, Union Street, Riego Street and Anzac Avenue in Dunedin North, and Cumberland Street in central Dunedin. The Forth Street campus buildings are situated between University of Otago campus and the Forsyth Barr Stadium, close to the edge of Logan Park. The Schools of Architecture, Building and Engineering and Natural Sciences are located on the old Rehabilitation League site on Anzac Avenue, and the Dunedin School of Art is located on Riego Street. Otago Polytechnic's library is the Robertson Library on Union Street, which it shares with the University of Otago College of Education. In 2009, Otago Polytechnic vacated buildings in Tennyson Street, close to Stuart Street in the central city. These buildings had previously housed the School of Hospitality, Languages and Fashion, and are owned by the Ministry of Education. In 2014, a $12 million redevelopment of Otago Polytechnic's F and H Blocks began to transform the space into a contemporary learning environment and Hub. Mason and Wales were the architects for this project. In 2016, Aoraki Polytechnic merged with Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology to form Ara Institute of Canterbury, and Otago Polytechnic took over the teaching of Aoraki's Dunedin-based programmes. These included beauty therapy, hairdressing, early childhood education, journalism, photography, and film and television. Technique training restaurant is located on Harbour Terrace and is an initiative established by Otago Polytechnic's School of Hospitality and its Food Design Institute, training future chefs, hotel managers and restaurant staff under the guidance of industry professionals. The restaurant uses produce from local suppliers and Otago Polytechnic's Living Campus gardens. The restaurant offers lunchtime and evening dining to members of the public and hosts a wide range of themed events throughout the year, including midwinter Christmas dining. There is also a Community Learning Centre in Mosgiel which delivers computer training to the public, as well as holding short computing courses. Central Otago campus Otago Polytechnic's Central Otago campus is located in Cromwell on the corner of Molyneux Ave and Erris St, with additional facilities at Bannockburn Road. Plans are underway to consolidate these sites at the Bannockburn Road block. Programmes on offer include long and short courses in Cookery, Business, and Horticulture. Qualifications in Ski and Snowboard Instruction and Avalanche Safety are delivered from Cardrona Alpine Resort and Mount Aspiring College. Otago Polytechnic's Central campus launched a qualification in high country farming in 2014, which is the only one of its kind in New Zealand. There are two Community Learning Centres which hold computing courses as well as being able to provide career guidance and study assistance for Otago Polytechnic students ‚Äì these are on the Central Otago Campus and in Queenstown. In 2009, the two Community Learning Centres in Wanaka and Alexandra were closed. Auckland International campus The Auckland International Campus caters to international students and offers professional qualifications in Business and Management, Information Technology as well as National Diplomas in Construction Management and Quantity Surveying. Classes are taught in English. The Auckland International Campus is located on Queen Street in downtown Auckland.  Student accommodation  In 2018, Otago Polytechnic officially opened its new 231-bed student accommodation complex, Te PƒÅ Tauira - Otago Polytechnic Student Village, at its Dunedin campus. It features dorm rooms, studios and apartments. The $22 million building, designed by Mason & Wales architects, is the largest timber- framed construction in New Zealand at 6000 square metres. The sustainable, cross-laminated timber structure won two awards at the Property Council New Zealand Rider Levett Bucknall Property Industry Awards 2018: Award of Excellence for Green Building and an Award of Merit for Multi-Unit Residential Property. At its Central Otago campus in the same year, the Polytechnic opened its $3 million, 25-bed student housing complex of fully self-contained units. International students Otago Polytechnic offers education and training to both New Zealand and international students. In 2017, Otago Polytechnic had 1252 equivalent full-time international students. Otago Polytechnic's English Language Centre offers academic and general English courses, aimed at international students, or migrants to Dunedin. Otago Polytechnic's Central Otago and Auckland International campuses also offer English Language courses.  Research and postgraduate  Its EPICentre is a multidisciplinary workshop studio, available to staff and students as a research facility.  Student exchange programmes and international partnerships  Otago Polytechnic offers a range of student exchange programmes, available to Otago Polytechnic and international students through its Study Abroad and Explore More initiatives. International programmes include English language teaching internships, summer school scholarship programmes, winter school scholarship programmes, and partnerships with tertiary institutions in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Otago Polytechnic also runs an education scholarship programme with its sister-city, Shanghai. Staff at Otago Polytechnic Otago Polytechnic has a workforce totalling 543 permanent staff as at the end of 2017. Its pay equity gap in 2017 sat at 4.8 per cent, considerably lower than the national average of 11 per cent. All Otago Polytechnic staff are required to undergo up to date training on New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi. Sustainability Otago Polytechnic has a sustainable campus. During the past three years, Otago Polytechnic has steadily increased the amount of cardboard, glass and plastic they recycle. Otago Polytechnic now recycles the following materials: paper; cardboard; glass; aluminium and steel cans; plastic types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; cooking oil and organic waste. The Polytechnic has also managed to reduce its amount of general waste by over two-hundred cubic metres. Since 2012, Otago Polytechnic has implemented some significant changes to reduce its ecological footprint, including creating an internal offset scheme for staff air travel. Otago Polytechnic also recently replaced coal- fired boilers with local woodchip boilers. As well as utilising a renewable energy resource, the potash will be used on the Living Campus gardens. The Living Campus project is the first of its kind in Australasia and involves turning Otago Polytechnic‚Äôs existing Dunedin campus into an open-air and interactive museum, a vibrant community garden and a sustainable model of urban agriculture. In 2015 Otago Polytechnic became the first polytechnic in New Zealand to achieve fair trade status. The institution has been awarded the Fair Trade status in recognition of its commitment to sell only Fair Trade products such as tea, coffee, sugar and chocolate drinks in its cafes and other commercial outlets, and sourcing Fair Trade materials for its schools where appropriate. This is in line with the city of Dunedin's stance towards Fair Trade practice. Dunedin was formally recognised by the Fair Trade Association as New Zealand's first Free Trade city in 2009.  Partnership with KƒÅi Tahu  In 2004, Otago Polytechnic signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the four Araiteuru Papatipu R≈´naka, or local MƒÅori councils: Te R≈´nanga ≈ç Moeraki, KƒÅti Huirapa R≈´naka ki Puketeraki, Te Runanga≈ç ≈åtƒÅkou, and Hokonui R≈´nanga. It was reviewed, revised and re-signed by all parties in 2013. The Memorandum guides the Polytechnic's goals and activities, underpinning its MƒÅori Strategic Framework. The MoU's principal objectives are to support and contribute to the achievement of MƒÅori development aspirations, and work together to identify specific educational needs of KƒÅi Tahu.  The Charity House Project  Otago Polytechnic‚Äôs Charity House project is a yearly initiative involving the Polytechnic's architecture, building and engineering students. It has been running since 2007, and has raised in excess of $1 million for charity, with the help of over 20 local businesses that donate time, materials and craftsmanship. At the end of the year, the house is auctioned off. The proceeds go to United Way NZ, a non-profit organisation which distributes the funds to Otago charities. Student services Otago Polytechnic offers a range of student services, both itself and in conjunction with University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic Students' Association. These include internal services such as a Childcare Centre, Student Learning Centre, Student Health Centre, Student IT Services and Te Punaka ≈åwheo, its dedicated MƒÅori centre. In partnership with Otago University, Polytechnic students have access to UNIPOL Recreation Centre and the Robertson Library. All enrolled Otago Polytechnic students may consider themselves members of the Otago Polytechnic Students' Association, an independent organisation run by the students and offers support, social events and clubs, access to facilities and services, and the free student magazine, Gyro. Students' association The Otago Polytechnic Students' Association provides access to many facilities and services like the student ID card, Clubs & Societies centre, a second-hand bookshop, UNIPOL Sports Centre, a free student newspaper (Gyro), free pool tables, free campus telephones, the Student Discount Directory, social events, and Student Job Search. The students' association also provides support services like advocacy, campaigns, representation, financial assistance and advice. OPSA is often involved with local authorities representing a student view, especially in transportation and housing issues. The students' association also advocates everyone's right to tertiary education, and that user-pays education creates a significant barrier to this right. It seeks a return to free tertiary education as it was before 1989. In 2008 and 2009 the Otago Polytechnic Students' Association took the unusual move of expelling its members involved in illegal violence at the Undie 500. In 2009 the students' association campaigned against the government's removal of student representation from polytechnic councils.

Today, 98% of Djibouti's 490,000 inhabitants are Muslims. According to Pew, 77% follow the denomination of Sunnism (primarily adhering to the Shafi'i legal tradition), whilst 8% are non- denominational Muslim, and the remaining 13% follow other sects such as Quranism, Shia, Ibadism etc.. After independence, the nascent republic constructed a legal system based in part on Islamic law.  History  The Al Sada Mosque in Djibouti City in the 1940s Islam was introduced to the Horn region early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. Zeila, in adjacent Somalia's two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn, dates to the 7th century and is the oldest mosque in the city. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate (with Zeila as its headquarters) dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the Benadir region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring Abyssinia.  Contemporary Islam  Many diverse forms of Islam are practised in Djibouti. Djibouti's population is predominantly Sunni Muslim. Islam is observed by 94% of the nation's population, while the remaining 6% of residents are spread between Roman Catholics, Protestants, Ethiopian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses, Hindus, Jews, Bahais, and atheists. The non-Muslim population consists generally of foreign-born citizens and mostly live in Djibouti City.  Politics  Djibouti mostly colored dark-blue (Shafi'i Sunni) Article 1 of the Constitution of Djibouti names Islam as the sole state religion, and Article 11 provides for the equality of citizens of all faiths and freedom of religious practice. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution does not allow for religious based political parties. Most local Muslims adhere to the Sunni denomination, following the Shafi'i school. The non-denominational Muslims largely belong to Sufi orders of varying schools.Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation retrieved 4 September 2013 According to the International Religious Freedom Report 2014, while Muslim Djiboutians have the legal right to convert to or marry someone from another faith, converts may encounter negative reactions from their family and clan or from society at large, and they often face pressure to revert to Islam. In 2012, a law was passed that grants the Ministry of Religious Affairs increased oversight of Djibouti‚Äôs mosques, including of messages disseminated during Friday prayers. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs reportedly used the new law that regulated mosques to replace imams and temporarily close some mosques. Some imams reported being questioned by security services following sermons with strong political and social justice themes. There were also reports of plainclothes officers monitoring the content of Friday sermons and the activities of people attending mosque services. In 2014, the government issued a decree executing a law on state control of mosques which converted the status of imams into civil service employees under the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and transferred ownership of mosque properties and other assets to the government. The Secretary General of the Ministry of Religious Affairs stated the decree aims to eliminate political activity from mosques and provide greater government oversight of mosque assets and activities. Government officials also indicated the law was designed to counter perceived foreign influence in mosques. According to article 23 of the Family Code, a non-Muslim man may marry a Muslim woman only after converting to Islam. Non-Islamic marriages are not legally recognized by the government, which only recognizes marriages performed in accordance with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs or the Ministry of the Interior. There are approximately 40 private Islamic schools nationwide, which are managed by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The public schools remain secular, although the Ministry of Islamic Affairs instituted a program in which religious leaders visit the secular schools for an hour to answer religious questions in non- mandatory events.

It has made over 50 voyages, and is best known as the support vessel of the Mir submersibles. The vessel is owned by the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, and is homeported in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. Named after the Soviet mathematician Mstislav Keldysh, it usually has 90 people on board (45 crew members, 20 or more pilots, engineers and technicians, 10 to 12 scientists and about 12 passengers). Among its facilities are 17 laboratories and a library. The ship was built in Rauma, Finland by Hollming Oy for the USSR Academy of Sciences (now the Russian Academy of Science). Construction of the vessel was completed on 28 December 1980. It started operations on 15 March 1981 for the Soviet Union. The Mir submersibles were added to her equipment in 1987. Keldysh was involved in the search for Soviet submarine K-278 Komsomolets, lost off the northeastern coast of Norway in 1989 after fire broke out on board. In addition to its nuclear reactor's core material, the submarine was carrying two nuclear torpedoes. Concern over the potential effects of the high-energy nuclear material on the rich fishing areas in which it lay prompted an effort to locate the sub's wreckage and ascertain its condition. Two months after the sinking, Keldysh located the wreckage of K-278 in June 1989 and Soviet governmental representatives labeled the risk of leaks to be \\"insignificant\\". Nevertheless, Keldysh mounted two expeditions to the wreck of K-278 (1994 and 1996) to seal fractures in the sub's hull. Among recent voyages, the Keldysh has made expeditions to two famous wrecks, the British liner Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck. Filmmaker James Cameron led three of those expeditions: two to the Titanic, in 1996 (for his film Titanic, which featured the Keldysh in present-day scenes) and 2001 (for his 2003 documentary film Ghosts of the Abyss), and one to the Bismarck in 2002 (for the Discovery Channel special Expedition: Bismarck). Cameron also led an expedition from the Keldysh for his 2005 documentary Aliens of the Deep.James Cameron's Aliens of the Deep (2005) The Keldysh also provided its significant deep diving submersibles MIR 1 and MIR 2 for the expedition in 1998 to film the expected recovery of gold from the World War II Japanese submarine I-52. Although 14 dives were made on the wreck, at a depth of over , no gold was recovered. A National Geographic crew consisting of director Mark Stouffer and director of photography Bill Mills and six others filmed the search for a National Geographic Special entitled Search for the Submarine I-52.

The initial line-up of the band included McMahon on vocals, John Guardico on guitar, Dennis DeVito on bass and Brian Dempsey on drums. The band has released a string of singles in between the late 1970s and early 1980s, before entering to a hiatus and reforming in 1988, with guitarist Rick Christyson and keyboardist Trent Reznor, the founder of the industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails. In 2004, McMahon reformed Lucky Pierre as a solo project to release its debut album, ThinKing. History The band started as Lakewood native Kevin McMahon's solo project. He started recording demos in 1974, while his brother, Brian McMahon, was a member of the protopunk band Electric Eels. The first line-up of the band as an act included John Guardico on guitar, Denis DeVito on bass and Brian Dempsey on drums. The band started performing in 1976 during the early new wave scene, which included the likes of Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Hammer Damage, Chi-Pig, and Devo. The band was also associated with Pere Ubu, a band which they performed with. Nevertheless, the band struggled to find venues for most of the time, as the band played McMahon's own compositions. After three years, Dempsey left the band to pursue other interests. Gary Shay briefly joined the band as a drummer and the band released \\"Fans & Cameras\\"/\\"Idlewood\\" single, on their own record label Unadultered Records, which sold more than a thousand copies. Shay left the band soon after and Dempsey was asked to return. The band now consisted of McMahon, Dempsey, Guardico, DeVito and Tom Lash who was brought in on bass plus Tom Miller on Keyboards. DeVito switched to rhythm guitar after the addition of bassist Tom Lash, who was a music director at WCSB, the college radio station of Cleveland State University. He played the band's demo on the station, which helped their music to be exposed to a receptive audience. This version of the band played out for about a year mostly at The Coach House in Cleveland Hts and its old stomping grounds, The Pirate's Cove. It disbanded after McMahon came into a rehearsal stating he was moving to California and that the band could either stay together and rehearse in case something happened (a contract) or do whatever they wanted but that he could no longer live in a city where no one appreciated his music. McMahon left town and the band members decided to go their separate ways. Some time passed and McMahon returned to Cleveland. By this time John Guardico was living in California and Dempsey was playing in several projects, The band reformed with DeVito on lead guitar, Lash on bass, McMahon and newcomer Dave Zima on drums. This was followed by \\"Into My Arms\\", which featured a b-side \\"Match\\", which was recorded live on July 16, 1980 at the band's only WMMS Coffee Break Concert. The group then added the keyboardist Tom Miller to its line-up. After releasing the third single, \\"Stetson's\\"/\\"Once A Child\\", in 1981, the band opened for the Plasmatics at Cleveland Agora. The gig ended harshly, with Plasmatics lead singer Wendy O. Williams being arrested for indecent exposure. The band also opened for Peter Frampton at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland in 1982. Following this performance, DeVito left the band, leaving the guitar duties to McMahon and the new band member Tom Sheridan. The band remained active until 1984; soon McMahon moved to San Francisco, leaving the band inactive for four years. In 1988, McMahon returned to Cleveland to reform Lucky Pierre. The new line-up featured previous members Lash and Zima, as well as guitarist Rick Christyson and keyboardist Trent Reznor of Exotic Birds and The Innocent, who would be known for his future music act, Nine Inch Nails. The band recorded one EP Comminuque, which featured a guest appearance by the past member John Guardico, at the same year. Trent Reznor performed with the band for six months, before being immersed in the recording of Nine Inch Nails' debut album, Pretty Hate Machine. He left the band in 1989 to concentrate on it and the band's manager, John Malm Jr. started to manage Nine Inch Nails. In 1990, the band officially disbanded after a final gig. After Lucky Pierre, McMahon formed the industrial rock band, Prick, featuring guitarist Chris Schleyer and Stabbing Westward drummer and Exotic Birds frontman Andy Kubiszewski. The band signed to Trent Reznor's own vanity record label, Nothing Records and released a self-titled album, produced by Reznor. The band was then dropped by Nothing's parent label, Interscope Records and released its second album The Wreckard independently in 2002. In 2004, McMahon reformed Lucky Pierre as a sole member and released its debut album, ThinKing, via his own record label Lucky Pierre Music.

He is currently on the faculty of Harvard University. He has co- authored over 450 papers, edited four volumes, and holds over 60 US patents. Biography Federico Capasso received the doctor of Physics degree, summa cum laude, from the University of Rome, Italy, in 1973 and after doing research in fiber optics at Fondazione Bordoni in Rome, joined Bell Labs in 1976. In 1984, he was made a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff and in 1997 a Bell Labs Fellow. In addition to his research activity Capasso has held several management positions at Bell Labs including Head of the Quantum Phenomena and Device Research Department and the Semiconductor Physics Research Department (1987‚Äì2000) and Vice President of Physical Research (2000‚Äì2002). He joined Harvard on January 1, 2003. He and his collaborators made many wide-ranging contributions to semiconductor devices, pioneering the design technique known as band-structure engineering. He applied it to novel low noise quantum well avalanche photodiodes, heterojunction transistors, memory devices and lasers. He and his collaborators invented and demonstrated the quantum cascade laser (QCL) (Faist, J; Capasso, F; Sivco, DL; Sirtori, C. ; Hutchinson, Al; Cho, AY \\"Quantum Cascade Laser\\" Science 264, 553-556 (1994)) . Unlike conventional semiconductor lasers, known as diode lasers, which rely on the band gap of the semiconductor to emit light, the wavelength of QCLs is determined by the energy separation between conduction band quantized states in quantum wells. In 1971 researchers postulated that such an emission process could be used for laser amplification in a superlattice (Kazarinov, RF; Suris, RA (April 1971). \\"Possibility of amplification of electromagnetic waves in a semiconductor with a superlattice\\". Fizika i Tekhnika Poluprovodnikov 5 (4): 797‚Äì800). The QCL wavelength can be tailored across a wide range from the mid- infrared to the far infrared by changing the quantum well thickness. The mature technology of the QCL is now finding commercial applications. QCLs have become the most widely used sources of mid-infrared radiation for chemical sensing and spectroscopy and are commercially available. They operate at temperatures in excess of 100 C and emit up to several Watts of power in continuous wave. Capasso's current research in quantum electronics deals with very high power continuous-wave QCLs, the design of new light sources based on giant optical nonlinearities in quantum wells such as widely tunable sources of terahertz radiation based on difference frequency generation and with plasmonics. He and his group at Harvard have demonstrated a new class of optical antennas and plasmonic collimators that they have used to design the near-field and far-field of semiconductor lasers, achieving ultrahigh intensity deep subwavelength size laser spots, laser beams with greatly reduced divergence and multibeam lasers. His group showed that suitably designed plasmonic interfaces consisting of optically thin arrays of optical nano-antennas lead to a powerful generalization of the centuries-old laws of reflection and refraction. They form the basis of \\"flat optics\\" based on metasurfaces. Federico Capasso has made major contributions to the study of quantum electrodynamical forces known as Casimir forces. He used the Casimir effect (the attraction between metal surfaces in vacuum due to its zero point energy) to control the motion of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). He demonstrated novel devices (Casimir actuators and oscillators), setting limits to the scaling of MEMs technology and with his collaborators Jeremy Munday and Adrian Parsegian was the first to measure a repulsive Casimir force. Awards and honors His honors include membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences and honorary membership in the Franklin Institute. In 2004, he received the Chisesi-Tomassoni award for his pioneering work on the quantum-cascade laser. In 2005 he received, jointly with Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek (MIT) and Anton Zeilinger (University of Vienna), the King Faisal International Prize for Science for his research on quantum cascade lasers. The citation called him \\"one of the most creative and influential physicists in the world.\\" On behalf of the American Physical Society, he was awarded the 2004 Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science, endowed by the NEC Corporation, for \\"seminal contributions to the invention and demonstration of the quantum cascade laser and the elucidation of its physics, which bridges quantum electronics, solid-state physics, and materials science.\\" SPIE, the international society of optics and photonics, selected Capasso to receive the 2013 SPIE Gold Medal, the highest honor the society bestows. (See Capasso video on the award.) In addition, the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), the world's largest technical professional organization, named Capasso the recipient of the 2004 IEEE Edison Medal with the following citation, \\"For a career of highly creative and influential contributions to heterostructure devices and materials.\\" He is also recipient of the John Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute, the R. W. Wood prize of the Optical Society of America, the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society W. Streifer Award for Scientific Achievement, the Materials Research Society Medal, the Rank Prize in Optoelectronics (UK), the Duddell Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics (UK), The Willis Lamb Medal for Laser Science and Quantum Optics, the Newcomb Cleveland Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the 1995 Moet Hennessy- Louis Vuitton \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" Prize (France), the Welker Memorial Medal (Germany), the New York Academy of Sciences Award, the IEEE David Sarnoff Award in Electronics, and the Goff Smith prize of the University of Michigan. In 2010 he received the Berthold Leibinger Zukunftspreis for research in applied laser technology and the Julius Springer Prize in Applied Physics. In 2011 he received the Jan Czochralski Medal of the European Materials Research society for his lifetime achievements in Materials Science. In 2016 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Applied Photonics \\"For his pioneering work in the quantum design of new materials with specific electronic and optical features, which led to the realization of a fundamentally new class of laser, the Quantum Cascade Laser; for his major contributions in plasmonics and metamaterials at the forefront of photonics science and technology\\". He received the Matteucci Medal in 2019 from the Italian National Academy of Sciences for his invention of the quantum cascade laser. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Institute of Physics (UK), the Optical Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, IEEE and SPIE. He holds honorary doctorates from Lund University, Sweden, the Diderot University (Paris VII), France, the University of Bologna, Italy and the University of Torvergata (Roma II), Italy.

There are three configurational isomers with this structure, that differ by the arrangement of the four C‚ÄìC single bonds adjacent to the double bonds. Each pair of single bonds can be on the same side (cis,Z) or on opposite sides (trans, E) of the double bond's plane; the three possibilities are denoted cis,cis, trans,trans, and cis,trans; or (Z,Z), (E,E), and (Z,E). (Because of overall symmetry, trans,cis is the same configuration as cis,trans.) Generally abbreviated COD, the cis,cis isomer of this diene is a useful precursor to other organic compounds and serves as a ligand in organometallic chemistry. It is a colorless liquid with a strong odor. 1,5-Cyclooctadiene can be prepared by dimerization of butadiene in the presence of a nickel catalyst, a coproduct being vinylcyclohexene. Approximately 10,000 tons were produced in 2005.  Organic reactions  COD reacts with borane to give 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, commonly known as 9-BBN, a reagent in organic chemistry used in hydroborations: :450px COD adds SCl (or similar reagents) to give 2,6-dichloro-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane: :2,6-Dichloro-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, synthesis and reactions The resulting dichloride can be further modified as the diazide or dicyano derivative in a nucleophilic substitution aided by anchimeric assistance.

Metal-COD complexes are attractive because they are sufficiently stable to be isolated, often being more robust than related ethylene complexes. The stability of COD complexes is attributable to the chelate effect. The COD ligands are easily displaced by other ligands, such as phosphines. Ni(COD) is prepared by reduction of anhydrous nickel acetylacetonate in the presence of the ligand, using triethylaluminium : [Ni(CHO)] + 2 COD + 2 Al(CH) ‚Üí Ni(COD) + 2 Al(CH)(CHO) + CH + CH The related Pt(COD) is prepared by a more circuitous route involving the dilithium cyclooctatetraene: :LiCH + PtCl(COD) + 3 CH ‚Üí [Pt(CH)] + 2 LiCl + CH + CH :Pt(CH) + 2 COD ‚Üí Pt(COD) + 3 CH Extensive work has been reported on complexes of COD, much of which has been described in volumes 25, 26, and 28 of Inorganic Syntheses. The platinum complex is a precursor to a 16-electron complex of ethylene: :Pt(COD) + 3 CH ‚Üí Pt(CH) + 2 COD COD complexes are useful as starting materials; one noteworthy example is the reaction: :Ni(COD) + 4 CO ‚Üí Ni(CO) + 2 COD The product Ni(CO) is highly toxic, thus it is advantageous to generate it in the reaction vessel upon demand. Other low-valent metal complexes of COD include cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer, cyclooctadiene iridium chloride dimer, and Fe(COD)(CO), and Crabtree's catalyst. The M(COD) complexes with nickel, palladium, and platinum have tetrahedral geometry, whereas [M(COD)] complexes of rhodium and iridium are square planar. (E,E)-COD :E,E-COD synthesis (St√∂ckmann et al. 2011) The highly strained trans,trans isomer of 1,5-cyclooctadiene is a known compound. (E,E)-COD was first synthesized by Whitesides and Cope in 1969 by photoisomerization of the cis,cis compound. Another synthesis (double elimination reaction from a cyclooctane ring) was reported by Huisgen in 1987. The molecular conformation of (E,E)-COD is twisted rather than chair-like. The compound has been investigated as a click chemistry mediator.

The area is often thought of as excluding the states and territories bordering the Pacific Ocean, which formed the Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). The campaign classification established by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the InteriorU.S. National Park Service, Civil War Battle Studies by Campaign. is more fine-grained than the one used in this article. Some minor NPS campaigns have been omitted and some have been combined into larger categories. Only a few of the 75 major battles the NPS classifies for this theater are described. Boxed text in the right margin show the NPS campaigns associated with each section. Activity in this theater in 1861 was dominated largely by the dispute over the status of the border state of Missouri. The Missouri State Guard, allied with the Confederacy, won important victories at the Battle of Wilson's Creek and the First Battle of Lexington. However, they were driven back at the First Battle of Springfield. A Union army under Samuel Ryan Curtis defeated the Confederate forces at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas in March 1862, solidifying Union control over most of Missouri. The areas of Missouri, Kansas, and the Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma) were marked by extensive guerrilla activity throughout the rest of the war, the most well-known incident being the infamous Lawrence massacre in the Unionist town of Lawrence, Kansas of August 1863. In the spring of 1862, Confederate forces pushed north along the Rio Grande River from El Paso, Texas through the New Mexico Territory, but were stopped at the Battle of Glorieta Pass (March 26‚Äì28, 1862). In 1863, General Edmund Kirby Smith took command of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, and unsuccessfully tried to relieve the Siege of Vicksburg by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on the opposite eastern banks of the Mississippi River in the state of Mississippi. As a result of the long campaign / siege and surrender in July 1863 by Gen. John C. Pemberton, the Union gained control of the entire Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. This left the Trans- Mississippi Department almost completely isolated from the rest of the Confederate States to the east. It became nicknamed and known as \\"Kirby Smithdom\\", emphasizing the Confederate Government's lack of direct control over the region. In the 1864 Red River Campaign, a U.S. force under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks tried to gain control over northwestern Louisiana, but was thwarted by Confederate troops commanded by Richard Taylor. Price's Raid, an attempt led by Major General Sterling Price to recapture Missouri for the Confederacy, ended when Price's troops were defeated in the Battle of Westport that October. On June 2, 1865, after all other major Confederate armies in the field to the east had surrendered, Kirby Smith officially surrendered his command in Galveston, Texas. On June 23, Stand Watie, who commanded Southern troops in the Indian Territory, became the last Confederate general to surrender. Principal Union Commanders of the Trans-Mississippi TheaterPrincipal Confederate Commanders of the Trans-Mississippi TheaterTrans-Mississippi Department The Confederate States Army's Trans-Mississippi Department was formed May 26, 1862, to include Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), and Louisiana west of the Mississippi River. It absorbed the previous Trans-Mississippi District (Department Number Two), which had been organized January 10, 1862, to include that part of Louisiana north of the Red River, the Indian Territory (later State of Oklahoma, 1907), and the states of Missouri and Arkansas, except for the country east of St. Francis County, Arkansas, to Scott County, Missouri. The combined department had its headquarters at Shreveport, Louisiana, and Marshall, Texas. Commanders * Maj. Gen.

Residents in the southern portions of this Territory adopted a secession ordinance of their own and requested that Confederate States of America military forces stationed further east in nearby Texas assist them in removing Union Army forces still stationed there. The Confederate Territory of Arizona was proclaimed by Col. John Baylor after victories in the First Battle of Mesilla on July 25, 1861, at Mesilla, New Mexico, and the capture of several Union forces. Southern forces advanced northward through the Rio Grande Valley, capturing Albuquerque and Santa Fe in March 1862. Attempts to press further northward in the territory were unsuccessful, and Confederate forces withdrew from Arizona completely in 1862 when Union reinforcements arrived from California. The Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 26‚Äì28, 1862, was a relatively small skirmish in terms of both numbers involved and losses (140 Union, 190 Confederate). Yet the military/political strategic issues were large, and the battle was decisive in resolving them. The Confederates might well have taken Fort Union further north in the Rio Grande river valley and even Denver, the territorial capital of the northern Colorado Territory had they not been stopped at Glorieta. As one Texan put it, \\"If it had not been for those devils from Pike's Peak, this country would have been ours.\\" This small battle dissolved any possibility of the Confederacy taking New Mexico and the far west territories. In April, the California Column, Union volunteers from California, pushed the remaining Confederates out of present-day Arizona at the Battle of Picacho Pass. In the Eastern United States, the fighting dragged on for three more years, but in the Southwest the war against the Confederacy was over, but the war against the Apache, Navaho and Comanche continued for the California garrisons until they were replaced by U. S. Army troops after the Civil War ended. Several battles occurred between Confederate soldiers and or militia within Confederate Arizona, the height of the Apache campaigns against rebel forces was during mid to late 1861. Missouri, Arkansas, and Kansas Though a slave state with a highly organized and militant secessionist movement, thanks to the pro- slavery \\"border ruffians\\" who battled antislavery militias in Kansas in the 1850s, Missourians sided with the Union by a ratio of two or three to one. Pro-Confederate Governor Claiborne F. Jackson and his small state guard under General Sterling Price linked up with Confederate forces under General Ben McCulloch. After victories at the Battle of Wilson's Creek and at Lexington, Missouri, Confederate forces were driven out of the state by the arrival of large Union forces in February 1862 and were effectively locked out by defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 6‚Äì8. A guerrilla conflict began to wrack Missouri. Gangs of Confederate insurgents, commonly known as \\"bushwhackers\\", ambushed and battled Union troops and Unionist state militia forces. Much of the fighting was between Missourians of different persuasions; both sides carried out large-scale atrocities against civilians, ranging from forced resettlement to murder. Historians estimate that the population of the state fell by one-third during the war; most survived but fled or were driven out by one side or the other. Many of the most brutal bushwhacker leaders, such as William C. Quantrill and William T. \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson, won national notoriety. A group of their followers remained under arms and carried out robberies and murders (which they may have considered to be ongoing guerilla resistance) for sixteen years after the war, under the leadership of Jesse James, his brother Frank James, and Cole Younger and his brothers. By most measures, the Confederate guerrilla insurgency in Missouri during the Civil War was the worst such conflict ever to occur on American soil. By one calculation, nearly twenty-seven thousand Missourians died in the violence. Historians have offered various explanations for the anomalously high level of guerrilla activity in Missouri, including the possibility that the violence was linked to thousands of court-ordered sales of property belonging to the state's Confederate sympathizers, beginning in 1862 and continuing throughout the war. The property sales arose from court judgments for defaulted debts incurred early in the war to arm rebel troops.Geiger, Mark W. Financial Fraud and Guerrilla Violence in Missouri's Civil War, 1861‚Äì1865. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010. . Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861, three months before the opening battle of the war at Fort Sumter. In August, 1863, Quantrill led his raiders into Kansas destroying much of the city of Lawrence and murdering over 150 unarmed men and boys in what became known as the Lawrence Massacre. On October 25, 1864, during Confederate Major General Sterling Price's raid into Kansas and Missouri, in three interconnected actions, Price's forces were defeated at the Battles of Marais des Cygnes, Mine Creek (one of the largest cavalry engagements of the war), and a final battle at Marmiton River, sealing the fate of Price's campaign and forcing his withdrawal into Indian Territory, and eventually Texas, before returning to Arkansas. Texas and Louisiana The Union mounted several attempts to capture the trans-Mississippi regions of Texas and Louisiana from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east under blockade or captured, Texas in particular became a blockade-running haven. Referred to as the \\"back door\\" of the Confederacy, Texas and western Louisiana continued to provide cotton crops that were transferred overland to the Mexican border towns of Matamoros and the port of Bagdad, and shipped to Europe by means of blockade runners in exchange for supplies. Determined to close this trade, the Union mounted several invasion attempts of Texas, each of them unsuccessful. Confederate victories at Galveston, Texas, the Battle of Sabine Pass and the Second Bayou Teche Campaign repulsed invasion forces. The Union's disastrous Red River Campaign in western Louisiana, including a defeat at the Battle of Mansfield, effectively ended the Union's final invasion attempt of the region until the fall of the Confederacy. Jeffery Prushankin argues that Kirby Smith's \\"pride, poor judgment, and lack of military skill\\" prevented General Richard Taylor from potentially winning a victory that could have greatly affected the military and political situation east of the Mississippi River.Prushankin, p. 233. Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued at a low level in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several months after Lee's surrender in April 1865. The last battle of the war occurred at Palmito Ranch in southern Texas from May 12‚Äì13. The battle ended in a Confederate victory. Indian Territory Indian Territory occupied most land of the current U.S. state of Oklahoma and served as an unorganized region set aside for Native American tribes of the Southeastern United States after being removed from their lands more than thirty years before the war. The area hosted numerous skirmishes and seven officially recognized battles involving Native American units allied with the Confederate States of America, Native Americans loyal to the United States government, and Union and Confederate troops. A campaign led by Union General James G. Blunt to secure Indian Territory culminated with the Battle of Honey Springs on July 17, 1863. Though his force included Native Americans, the Union did not incorporate Native American soldiers into its regular army.American Civil War Resource Database Officers and soldiers supplied to the Confederacy from Native American lands numbered at 7,860 and came largely from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole nations.Confer, Clarissa. The Cherokee Nation in the Civil War (University of Oklahoma Press, 2007) pg.4 Among these was Brig. Gen. Stand Watie, a Cherokee who raided Union positions in Indian Territory with his 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles regiment well after most of the Confederate forces abandoned the area. Watie led his troops in guerrilla warfare by attacking Union positions, supply wagons, and by attacking other Cherokee and Native Americans who supported the Union. He became the last Confederate General to surrender when he signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives on June 23, 1865.

English-dubbed versions have been released under several titles, including The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon, Prince in Wonderland and Rainbow Bridge. Based on the Shint≈ç myth of the storm god Susanoo's battle with the Yamata no Orochi, the color, \\"T≈çeiScope\\" anamorphic format film is scripted by Ichir≈ç Ikeda and Takashi Iijima and directed by Y≈´go Serikawa. It is considered one of the very best of the T≈çei D≈çga features and a landmark in anime and animated features in general, placing 10th in the list of the 150 best animated films and series of all time compiled by Tokyo's Laputa Animation Festival from an international survey of animation staff and critics in 2003. It features distinctively modernist, abstracted character, background and color design, formalised the role of animation director, performed here by Yasuji Mori, in the Japanese system and drew attention to the talents of key animators Yasuo ≈åtsuka and Y≈çichi Kotabe (whose key animation for the film, though he is credited in it as an in-betweener, is his first) and assistant directors Isao Takahata and Kimio Yabuki. The score, composed by Akira Ifukube, is also acclaimed. Plot This anime film tells the story of the god Susano'o (as a cute boy), whose mother Izanami has died. He is deeply hurt by the loss of his mother but his father Izanagi tells him that his mother is now in heaven. Despite Izanagi's warnings, Susano'o eventually sets off to find her. Along with his companions, Akahana (a little talking rabbit) and Titan B≈ç (a strong but friendly giant from the Land of Fire), Susano'o overcomes all obstacles in his long voyage. He eventually comes to the Izumo Province, where he meets Princess Kushinada, a little girl whom he becomes friends with (he also thinks that she is so beautiful that she looks like his mother). Kushinada's family tells Susano'o that their other seven daughters were sacrificed to the fearsome eight-headed serpent, the Yamata no Orochi. Susano'o is so infatuated with Kushinada that he decides to help her family protect her and slay the Orochi once and for all and he, Akahana and B≈ç prepare for the showdown. Notes This film eschewed the soft, rounded look of previous T≈çei animated features for a more stylized one. It is also one of the few animated films to have music by famed composer Akira Ifukube, the other being the posthumously-released Tetsujin Nij≈´hachi-g≈ç feature Hakuch≈´ no Zangetsu. A symphonic suite of five movements based on the score's cues was created by Ifukube in 2003, the first recording of which was performed by the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Tetsuji Honna and released on Compact Disc by King Records within the same year. Some of the film's music was also redeployed in the 1st and 32nd episodes, first broadcast in 1972 and 1973 respectively, of the T≈çei Animation television series Mazinger Z. The film's theme song, , is also composed by Ifukube, with lyrics by Takashi Morishima, and is sung by Setsuko Watanabe. The original, monaural soundtrack recording has been released three times on Compact Disc, two of which are now out of print. The first was a two disc set released by Futureland in 1992, which paired it with a disc of alternate takes and Ifukube's score for Mitsubishi's Expo '70 exhibit. The second release was part of a ten disc collection of T≈çei Animation soundtracks released by Nippon Columbia in 1996, it featured better audio quality but lacked the alternate takes. On May 23, 2018, Japanese record label Cinema-kan released the score for a third time as a remastered two disc set, titled The Naughty Prince's Orochi Slaying Original Soundtrack (CINK-51-52). The first disc contains the complete score while the second disc contains alternate takes, sound effects and trailer music.

Dol Said or in full Dato' Abdul Said was a 19th-century Malay leader of an area called Naning, which was then part of Malacca on the Malay Peninsula. He opposed taxation by the British's taxation policy in the area and refused to pay it. This was a direct cause of a conflict known as the Naning War. Dol Syedsxs defiance led the British to send 150 soldiers led by Captain Wyllie to capture Naning in early August 1831. Naning however successfully defended itself by fighting a guerilla conflict and aid from other Malay allies, which included the chiefdoms of Seri Menanti, Rembau, Sungai Ujong, Johol and Muar. The British realised that the rebelling forces could not be easily suppressed, and requested reinforcement from the Yamtuan Muda Raja Ali in Rembau. Raja Ali agreed to send 600 troops to assist British in suppressing the revolt. Later in March 1832, British sent a larger force, consisting of 1200 soldiers to defeat Dol Said's men. In the second attack, Naning failed to receive military aid from its neighbours, and along with the presence of a huge British expedition force, caused Dol Said to retreat to Sri Menanti before surrendering himself to the British, effectively ending the conflict. The British then incorporated Naning into their colony of Malacca. Until today, Dol Said is still remembered and regarded as a nationalist hero in Malaysia who stood up to foreign aggression and colonialism.http://www.melaka.gov.my/eng/history2.asp References Category:Malaysian rebels Category:Malaysian people of Malay descent Category:People from Malacca Category:1773 births Category:1849 deaths Category:History of Kedah Category:People of British Malaya Category:1830s in British Malaya ","title":"Dol Said"},{"id":"4167685","text":"Irene McGee (b. 1976) is a podcaster who created and hosted No One's Listening, a podcast about the mass media.Fong-Torres, Ben. \\"Radio Waves\\".

The plan is currently being delivered by Brisbane City Council at an estimated total cost of over $10 billion across five stages. According to the Brisbane City Council website, TransApex is \\"the biggest urban road project proposed in Australia\\". Background Brisbane is well known for its significant long-term population growth, and this growth combined with the city's proximity to the high growth areas of the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast puts major pressure on the road and public transport network, with peak hour congestion on parts of the Brisbane road network.‚Äô'2007 Brisbane Urban Corridor Strategy'‚Äô, Department of Transport and Regional Services, Commonwealth of Australia, 2010, Despite the visible impacts of the high growth on the road network, road infrastructure and public transport in south- east Queensland has failed to keep up with the resulting increase in vehicular demand.\\"State of Australian Cities 2010\\", Commonwealth of Australia, March 2010, , page 54 (Section 4) Brisbane's road network operates essentially as a 'hub', with the city's major roads feeding directly into the CBD. In 2004, when TransApex was first proposed, there was only one corridor that traffic could use to bypass the city centre (the former Gateway Bridge), which lies to the east of the CBD as the crow flies. Original plan=Labor proposal During the tenure of former Lord Mayor Jim Soorley, Labor had investigated a number of tunnels throughout Brisbane, including the future Clem Jones Tunnel and Airport Link, though none had progressed past feasibility studies by the time of the 2004 election. Liberal proposal As the Liberal lord mayoral candidate in the 2004 Brisbane local government election, Newman proposed a transport infrastructure plan which would \\"revolutionise cross-town travel for motorists and provide for the creation of cross-suburban bus routes for public transport patrons... while its resultant free-flowing road network will mean shorter trips, reduced fuel consumption and decreased vehicle emissions.\\" Newman's original proposal was a system of five tunnels to be constructed in two stages: ::Stage One (2004‚Äì2013, $3.2 billion) # The East/West Distributor: a four-lane tunnel (including a river tunnel) linking Logan Road and Old Cleveland Road at Stones Corner, the South East Freeway and Ipswich Road at Woolloongabba and the Western Freeway at Toowong (now East-West Link) # The North/South Distributor: a , four-lane tunnel running under Main Street and the Story Bridge, linking Ipswich Road, the South East Freeway, Logan Road and Old Cleveland Road with Bowen Bridge Road and the Inner City Bypass at Bowen Hills (now Clem Jones Tunnel) # The Northern Link: a , four-lane tunnel connecting the Western Freeway with the Hale Street Inner City Bypass route. This tunnel will also serve as a link between the East/West Distributor and the North/South Distributor, completing Brisbane's first inner ring road system (now Legacy Way) # The Hale Street/South Brisbane Connection: a 600-metre, four-lane tunnel linking Hale Street with Merivale and Cordelia Streets at South Brisbane. This tunnel represents a pre-emptive move against an expected growth in traffic in the area caused by the West End Urban Renewal Program (now Go Between Bridge) Stage Two (2014‚Äì2018, $800 million) # The Kingsford Smith Drive Duplication: a tunnel linking the Inner City Bypass at the Breakfast Creek Hotel with the new alignment of the Gateway Arterial Road. This tunnel ensures that each of the city's main arterial roads is directly connected to the inner ring road system (now split into two distinct projects: Airport Link and Kingsford-Smith Drive widening) The two stages of TransApex were proposed to be funded by a combination of a toll of $2 (including GST) per segment link and contributions from Federal, State and Local governments. Current structure The final implementation strategy of the plan is significantly different from what was originally proposed, and now consists of four tunnels and one bridge linking various parts of the city. The Kingsford Smith Drive Tunnel is likely to be abandoned and replaced by two projects ‚Äì a tunnel linking the end of the North South Bypass Tunnel to the Brisbane Airport (part of the Airport Link project) and a staged surface upgrade of Kingsford Smith Drive. The five projects (in chronological order of project commencement) are: *Clem Jones Tunnel (CLEM7) *Airport Link *Go Between Bridge (formerly Hale Street Link) *Legacy Way (formerly Northern Link) *East-West Link Construction of the Clem Jones Tunnel, Legacy Way, Go Between Bridge and Airport Link has been completed, construction is currently underway on Stage 1 of the Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade. Discussions are still underway regarding the East-West Link and Stages 2 and 3 of the Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade and as of June 2011 firm construction dates for these projects have not been announced. TransApex projects=Clem Jones Tunnel (North South Bypass Tunnel) This tunnel was the largest project in the original TransApex proposal, and commenced construction in 2006 after the Royal Queensland Show in August. It links Woolloongabba to Bowen Hills via Kangaroo Point under the Story Bridge. This project was delivered as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) by the Rivercity Motorway consortium at a final cost of $3.2 billion. The tunnel was opened on 18 March 2010, with traffic able to use the tunnel toll- free for 3 weeks due to its early opening. When the $3.95 toll was instated, poor initial patronage forced the operators to reduce the toll to $2 to encourage usage. The toll has since returned to its original value of $3.95. Airport Link This project was not part of the original TransApex proposal, and was first proposed by Soorley as Stages 2 and 3 of the North- South Bypass Tunnel. The tunnel originates at the northern end of the Clem Jones Tunnel at Bowen Hills and links the CBD to the Brisbane Airport via Kedron. For ease of construction, this tunnel was built in conjunction with the Northern Busway project and the Airport Roundabout Upgrade project. Airport Link was constructed by Brisconnections and also used the PPP model. Construction costs for the project were estimated to be $4.8 billion and the toll is expected to be $4.90 per trip when full tolling commences in November 2013. The Airport Link project is the largest road infrastructure project in Australia and is the most expensive of the TransApex projects. Go Between Bridge Although originally proposed as a tunnel, a feasibility study favoured a bridge for economic and engineering reasons. It connects the western end of the Inner City Bypass with Merivale and Cordelia Streets in South Brisbane to the west of the existing William Jolly Bridge. The bridge was constructed by the Hale Street Link Alliance at a final cost of $338 million. As of 1 July 2011 the toll will be $2.35 (adjusted for CPI), which is the lowest of all the TransApex projects. Legacy Way This tunnel links the Western Freeway at the Toowong roundabout to the Inner City Bypass near Victoria Park golf course. The Transcity joint venture commenced construction in April 2011 and the project was finished in mid-2015 at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, including over $1 billion borrowed from the State Government and $500 million of federal funding. The toll was set at $3 for the first year after opening and as of April 2020, the toll is $5.19 per trip. East-West Link This tunnel is proposed to link the Western Freeway at the Toowong roundabout to the Pacific Motorway at Buranda. It is currently expected to commence sometime around 2026 but may be brought forward depending on the findings of a review currently underway by Brisbane City Council. The project does not appear in the Queensland State Government South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program running to 2031. As of June 2011 the proposed delivery model and toll and construction costs for the project have not been released. Controversy Despite the TransApex projects being a significant factor behind Newman's 2004 election victory, the initial support has been largely negated by community backlash and financial concerns regarding the projects' long term viability. Financial Australian tunnel operators have a poor financial track record, with Connector Motorways (Lane Cove Tunnel, Sydney) and Cross City Motorway (Cross City Tunnel, Sydney) both going into receivership. Of the TransApex tunnels, Rivercity Motorways went into receivership in February 2011 and BrisConnections in January 2012. Speculated causes for the financial difficulties include underestimated costs and overestimated revenue; the Clem Jones Tunnel was originally budgeted at $2 billion. Prior to the finish of construction, Airport Link constructors Leighton Holdings forecast a pre-tax loss of $430 million on the project. Tolls The current toll prices are all higher than the $2 per link proposed in the initial plan, and none of the remaining projects are likely to have tolls below this figure. Research has shown that tolling new infrastructure can actually discourage people from using it, keeping volumes high on the congested surface roads.

She was later renamed Patchogue (PC-586), the second U.S. Navy ship of the name, but never saw active service under that name.  Career  Patchogue was laid down on 29 May 1942 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan; launched as USS PC-586 on 15 July 1942; and commissioned on 5 October 1942. After sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico, PC-586 transited the Panama Canal and served as an escort craft along the west coast of the United States. Her coastal operations were ultimately extended to the Hawaiian Islands, and during the period of 1 August through 31 December 1943, she was assigned to Commander, Hawaiian Sea Frontier, for duty. During this time she rendered valuable service as a training craft in the area of Pearl Harbor. She likewise performed patrol and convoy escort missions in Hawaiian waters. A convoy escort mission took PC-586 to Saipan on 23 July 1944. With the end of hostilities, the submarine chaser continued to bolster Fleet readiness by briefly serving in a training capacity out of Pearl Harbor, and then along the east coast at both Charleston, South Carolina and Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone. PC-586 decommissioned and went into reserve at Norfolk, Virginia in January 1950. She was named Patchogue on 15 February 1956, the second U.S. Navy ship of the name. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1959, and shortly thereafter sold to Potomac Shipwrecking Company for scrapping. Awards Patchogue received one battle star for World War II service.

The park is spread across the Pocono Mountains. The park is easily accessible from Interstate 476 and Interstate 80. Hickory Run State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". Recreation The park supports many activities, some of which vary seasonally. During the summer months, swimming is available in Sand Spring Lake, which is partially bordered by a sand beach. No lifeguards are stationed at the site. In winter, the frozen lake can be used for ice skating. Seasonal hunting is permitted in many areas of the park, with white-tailed deer, black bear, and squirrels among the game that may be hunted legally. Additional hunting opportunities are available in nearby state game lands, some of which directly border the park. Hiking The park contains of trails that offer a variety of hiking experiences. For example, the long \\"Shades of Death\\" Trail follows the course of Sand Spring Run through dense rhododendron bushes that bloom from mid-June through mid-July. The run is dammed at certain points, creating lakes. The Fireline, Gould, and Pine Hill Trails are suitable for cross-country skiing in winter. A short walk on the Hawk Falls trail leads to a popular waterfall. Biking is prohibited on all trails.

The field comprises about ( or ) in area ( east-west by north-south). The top of the boulder layer is virtually level with the approaching path. This boulder field, known as the Hickory Run boulder field, is the largest of its kind in the Appalachian region. It consists of a very gently sloping expanse of boulders that occupies axis of a small valley with approximately of relief.Smith, H.T.U., 1953. The Hickory Run boulder field, Carbon County, Pennsylvania. American Journal of Science, 251(9), pp. 625-642. A coniferous forest with stony loam soils surrounds the Hickory Run boulder field.Natural Resource Conservation Service, 2014, Soil Survey Geographic database for Pennsylvania. Forth Worth, Texas: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. The boulders in the Hickory Run boulder field range from less than to more than in length. They consist of hard, gray-red, medium-grained sandstone and conglomeratic sandstone from the Catskill Formation which forms the adjacent ridgelines. The boulders at the northeast, upslope, end of the boulder field are generally more angular than those found downslope to the southwest. In the southwest part of the boulder field, boulders are typically subrounded and overlie a layer of small, polished clasts with a red weathering rind. To the southeast, there is a distinct group of boulders, which are less than long. They appear to be bedrock that is shattered in situ.Wedo, A.M., 2013, Boulder orientation, shape, and age along a transect of the Hickory Run Boulder Field, Pennsylvania [M.S. Thesis]. Newark, Delaware, University of Delaware, 76 p.Denn, A.R., Bierman, P.R., Zimmerman, S.R., Caffee, M.W., Corbett, L.B. and Kirby, E., Cosmogenic nuclides indicate that boulder fields are dynamic, ancient, multigenerational features. GSA Today, 28(3-4), pp. 4-10. doi: 10.1130/GSATG340A.1. One of two processes, both involving periglacial processes, explains the formation of boulder fields, such as the Hickory Run boulder field. First, boulder-size blocks are generated from the fracturing of an upslope bedrock outcrop by alternating freeze and thaw. As boulders accumulate at the base of the rock slope, periglacial ice-catalyzed heaving and sliding transports them downslope during cold climatic periods to form boulder fields. Finally, boulder fields are also formed by the exhumation of corestones. Initially, corestones form underground by the action of spheroidal weathering on jointed bedrock. Later, the weathered rock, which is called saprolite and formed by the alteration of rock, is progressively removed by erosion from around the corestones to expose them as isolated boulders. In time, these boulders are altered and redistributed over time by the accumulation of unconsolidated soil and sediment; freeze and thaw; and perhaps by periglacial action or glaciation during cold periods to form boulder fields.Andr√©, M.F., Hall, K., Bertran, P. and Arocena, J., 2008. Stone runs in the Falkland Islands: Periglacial or tropical?. Geomorphology, 95(3-4), pp. 524-543. The presence of glacial erratics south of the area of the Hickory Run boulder field indicate that this area has been covered by an ice sheet at least once, although the timing of the ice sheet or multiple ice sheets is uncertain. The most extensive ice sheet to cover the area containing this boulder field occurred prior to 900,000 years ago as evidenced by reversed magnetic polarity glacial deposits found south of the boulder field. Proglacial deposits of normal polarity suggest the occurrence of another glaciation extensive enough to covered this area sometime after 740,000 years ago. The last glaciation to have covered the area of the Hickory Run boulder field is mapped as Illinoian, about 150,000 years ago. However, it is possible that this ice sheet is somewhat older than this at about 400,000 years agoBraun, D.D., 2004. The glaciation of Pennsylvania, USA. Developments in Quaternary Sciences 2, Part C, pp. 237-242. However, cosmogenic nuclide studies demonstrate that some boulders of the Hickory Run boulder field have been exposed at the near surface for about 600,000 years. The interpretation of this data concluded that this boulder field has survived multiple glacial- interglacial cycles and possibly at least one glaciation. This conclusion would indicate that it and other boulder fields are dynamic features that persisted through multiple glacial-interglacial cycles because of the resistance of boulders to weathering and erosion. The large size of Hickory Run boulder field likely reflects multiple periods of periglacial activity during a number of glacial periods.

He was married to historian Patricia Herlihy; one of their sons is the historian of bicycles, David V. Herlihy. Topics of his included domestic life, especially the roles of women, and the changing structure of the family. He studied for his bachelors at the University of San Francisco, received a doctoral degree from Yale University and taught at Bryn Mawr College, Wisconsin, Harvard and Brown. His study of the Florentine and Pistoiese Catasto of 1427 is one of the first statistical surveys to use computers to analyze large amounts of data. The resulting book examines statistical patterns in tax-collecting surveys to find indications of social trends. The University of San Francisco history department named their annual award for the best student-written history paper the David Herlihy Prize, and Brown University has established a David Herlihy University Professorship.

January 1937, previously known as Hong Kong Prison at Stanley) is one of the six maximum security facilities in Hong Kong. History Built in 1937, Stanley Prison is currently the oldest institution still in service (the oldest prison built in Hong Kong was Victoria Prison, which ceased operation on 24 December 2005) and houses both male adult convicted prisoners and male adult remand prisoners. It was set up by the then Prisons Department, and is now administered by the Correctional Services Department. The maximum capacity of the prison is 1,511 and it has over 800 staff and officers. Stanley Prison, at the time of its construction, was considered to be one of the finest prisons in the British Empire. It was a modern structure built of stone, concrete and steel and consisted of six cell blocks set behind an 18-foot wall. It was originally designed to house 1,500 prisoners. Before Hong Kong officially abolished the death penalty in 1993, Stanley Prison had been a place of execution that saw the execution of criminals between 1946 and 1966. Although the law did not change until 1993, the last execution that was carried out in Stanley Prison was in November 1966.The last execution in Hong Kong was carried out on 16 November 1966 when Wong Kai-Kei, age 26, was hanged at Stanley Prison. See: \\"Demise of the Death Penalty\\", South China Morning Post, 23 March 2004. Official Notebook of Mr R.V Brimmicombie-Wood recording executions in 1966. On display at Hong Kong Correctional Services Museum. (This figure (122) does not include the large number of prisoners who were killed by the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong in World War II‚Äîsee below.) The area which once housed the gallows has now been replaced with the prison hospital. Japanese occupation Hong Kong fell to the invading Japanese on Christmas Day 1941 following a brief but brutal conflict. During the Japanese occupation, the grounds of the prison were used as part of Stanley Internment Camp. It was a place of torture and execution, with Mateen Ansari, who was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his heroism in resisting the Japanese, as one of the most famous victims. During the Japanese invasion of China, refugees crawled across the border to Hong Kong and many became hawkers on the streets. Those who were caught were sent to Stanley Prison and soon the inmate population grew to over 3,000, well over its limits. Hong Kong Correctional Services Museum Adjacent to Stanley Prison is the Hong Kong Correctional Services Museum. The museum is housed in a two-storey building next to the parade ground of the Staff Training Institute of the Correctional Services Department in Stanley. It has an area of 480 square metres with a collection of some 600 artefacts.
