Originally, it was used as the mandibular equivalent of a cast, to fix the jaw in place while a fracture healed. Today, jaws may also be wired for weight- loss purposes, to prevent the ingestion of solid food.  Mechanism  Jaw wiring is performed by attaching orthodontic brackets to the teeth, and wrapping pliable wire either around or through the brackets. The wiring may be configured to place the patient‚Äôs lower jaw in a semi-closed resting position. This permits a moderate amount of jaw movement and relatively clear speech, but inhibits the ingestion of solid foods, forcing patients to adhere to a liquid diet.  Types of jaw wiring = Inter-maxillary fixation = The type of jaw wiring used in patients with mandibular fractures, or those who need orthognathic surgery to correct deformed jaws, is known as inter- maxillary fixation (IMF) or maxillo-mandibular fixation (MMF). It is performed by an oral surgeon, who attaches an \\"arch bar\\" to the upper jaw and another to the lower jaw with thin wires that are threaded between and around the teeth. The arch bars completely enwrap the dental arch. The upper and lower arch bars are connected to each other with elastics, compressing the upper teeth against the lower teeth and preventing jaw movement. IMF is an invasive procedure performed under general anesthesia. Once the bones have set (usually after 8‚Äì10 weeks), the wiring is removed under local anesthesia or nitrous oxide sedation. = Orthodontic jaw wiring = The second type of jaw wiring is called orthodontic jaw wiring (OJW) or dental jaw wiring, and can be used as a treatment for obesity and compulsive overeating. In this procedure, a dentist or orthodontist attaches braces to certain teeth (typically the canines and premolars) and inserts wiring, but not elastics, between the upper and lower teeth in a figure-8 pattern. The wiring is removed periodically to allow the jaw joints to move freely, especially in the vertical direction. The procedure is not invasive and does not require anesthesia. Unlike inter-maxillary fixation, OJW does not keep the upper and lower teeth in contact. The sole purpose of the wiring is to limit the extent to which the jaws may open. In the resting position, the teeth are parted 2‚Äì4 millimeters, with the lips lightly touching. Orthodontic jaw wiring is removed when the patient has achieved their weight loss goals.

It is one of four ethnic studies centers established at UCLA that year, all of which were the first in the nation and have advanced our understanding of the essential contributions of people of color to U.S. history, thought, and culture. The centers remain the major organized research units in the University of California system that focus on ethnic and racial communities and contribute to the system's research mission. Organization The CSRC serves the entire campus and supports faculty and students in the social sciences, life sciences, humanities, and the professional schools. Its research addresses the past and also growing Chicano and Latino population, which now constitutes nearly one-third of California and one-half of Los Angeles, but continues to have disproportionately low access to higher education. The CSRC is one of four ethnic studies centers established at UCLA in 1969 that are now part of the Institute of American Cultures (IAC),Institute of American Cultures (IAC) which reports to the Office of the Chancellor at UCLA. The CSRC is also a founding member of the national Inter- University Program for Latino ResearchInter-University Program for Latino Research (IUPLR, est. 1983), a consortium of Latino research centers that now includes twenty-five institutions in the United States. Facilities The CSRC houses a library, special collections archive, an academic press, research programs, community-based partnerships, and two competitive grant/fellowship programs organized through the IAC. Each year the CSRC is able to augment grants and fellowships through funds created specifically for research at the CSRC. These include Los Tigres del Norte Fund, the Tamar Diana Wilson Fund, and the Carlos M. Haro Scholarship Fund. Since the 1970s, the CSRC holds six \\"institutional FTE\\" or faculty positions that are placed on loan to departments. These positions were originally designed to increase the center's research capacity, but they also allow the center to serve as a vital force across campus for diversifying the curriculum and the faculty. Press Since its founding, the CSRC has played a pivotal role in the development of scholarly research on the Chicano-Latino population. The UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press publishes research by and about Mexican Americans. The Press was partly responsible for the founding and flowering of Chicano studies in the 1970s‚Äîlaunching the careers of young academics who could not find mainstream publishers. The press has published the journal of record in the field, Aztl√°n: A Journal of Chicano Studies,Aztl√°n: A Journal of Chicano Studies for over thirty-five years. It has also published over 100 scholarly books, research reports, reference guides, policy briefs, newsletters, and DVDs. Four books published by the CSRC in 2012 won 10 awards in eight different categories at Latino Literacy Now's 15th annual International Latino Book Awards. As of 2013, the Press has received a total of 24 book awards. Three CSRC Press series are of special note. The A Ver: Revisioning Art HistoryA Ver: Revisioning Art History book series is a ground-breaking effort to document the work of prominent individual Latino artists. As of 2013, the published volumes are on Gronk, Yolanda M. Lopez, Celia √Ålvarez Mu√±oz, Mar√≠a Brito, Carmen Lomas Garza, Malaquias Montoya, Rafael Ferrer, and Ricardo Valverde. The Chicano Archives book series includes reference guides to UCLA library special collections on Chicanos, with histories and finding aids. Subjects include the renowned community arts organization Self Help Graphics & Art in East Los Angeles, the Robert Legorreta‚ÄìCyclona Collection, the Mexican Museum of San Francisco Papers, the Oscar Castillo Papers and Photograph Collection, the Latino Theatre Initiative/Center Theatre Group Papers, and the Arhoolie Foundation's Strachwitz Frontera Collection of Mexican and Mexican American Recordings. The Chicano Cinema & Media ArtsChicano Cinema & Media Arts series is an effort to preserve the many important Chicano films and videos that are no longer available. The first DVD is about the two earliest Chicano art documentaries; subsequent DVDs have focused on the video work of individual Chicano artists, including Laura Aguilar, Harry Gamboa Jr., and Gronk. Through its many publications, the press has shaped opinion, policy, and research on the Chicano population, both nationally and internationally. Library Established in 1969, the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Library was the first library in the United States to focus on the Mexican- descent population. Today, it continues to serve the needs of students and faculty at UCLA and around the world. The CSRC is a non-circulating library, though most materials may be photocopied within the premises. The Library's holdings consist of monographs, subject files, dissertations and theses, films, videotapes, audio recordings, and manuscript collections. The Library has also entered partnerships to provide online digital collections of music, photography, and the visual arts. The Library hosts art exhibitions, film screenings, and meetings, and it works closely with other UCLA libraries, community-based resources, and other Latino archives.  Archive  The CSRC Archive is considered to hold among the most important national and international research collections in existence on the Chicana and Chicano experience. The Archive holds over 120 collections including periodicals, original prints by Chicana/o artists, photographs, slides, papers, and records. Of special is the Archive's collection of monolingual and bilingual English and Spanish newspapers and journals published throughout the southwestern U.S. from the nineteenth century onward. The Archive has recently taken on digital archive projects, and works with UCLA based libraries to provide access.

If G is defined over a field k, then LG is an extension of the absolute Galois group of k by a complex Lie group. There is also a variation called the Weil form of the L-group, where the Galois group is replaced by a Weil group. Here, the letter L in the name also indicates the connection with the theory of L-functions, particularly the automorphic L-functions. The Langlands dual was introduced by in a letter to A. Weil. The L-group is used heavily in the Langlands conjectures of Robert Langlands. It is used to make precise statements from ideas that automorphic forms are in a sense functorial in the group G, when k is a global field. It is not exactly G with respect to which automorphic forms and representations are functorial, but LG. This makes sense of numerous phenomena, such as 'lifting' of forms from one group to another larger one, and the general fact that certain groups that become isomorphic after field extensions have related automorphic representations. Definition for separably closed fields From a reductive algebraic group over a separably closed field K we can construct its root datum (X*, Œî,X*, Œîv), where X* is the lattice of characters of a maximal torus, X* the dual lattice (given by the 1-parameter subgroups), Œî the roots, and Œîv the coroots. A connected reductive algebraic group over K is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by its root datum. A root datum contains slightly more information than the Dynkin diagram, because it also determines the center of the group. For any root datum (X*, Œî,X*, Œîv), we can define a dual root datum (X*, Œîv,X*, Œî) by switching the characters with the 1-parameter subgroups, and switching the roots with the coroots. If G is a connected reductive algebraic group over the algebraically closed field K, then its Langlands dual group LG is the complex connected reductive group whose root datum is dual to that of G. Examples: The Langlands dual group LG has the same Dynkin diagram as G, except that components of type Bn are changed to components of type Cn and vice versa. If G has trivial center then LG is simply connected, and if G is simply connected then LG has trivial center. The Langlands dual of GLn(K) is GLn(C). Definition for groups over more general fields Now suppose that G is a reductive group over some field k with separable closure K. Over K, G has a root datum, and this comes with an action of the Galois group Gal(K/k). The identity component LGo of the L-group is the connected complex reductive group of the dual root datum; this has an induced action of the Galois group Gal(K/k). The full L-group LG is the semidirect product :LG = LGo√óGal(K/k) of the connected component with the Galois group. There are some variations of the definition of the L-group, as follows: *Instead of using the full Galois group Gal(K/k) of the separable closure, one can just use the Galois group of a finite extension over which G is split. The corresponding semidirect product then has only a finite number of components and is a complex Lie group. *Suppose that k is a local, global, or finite field. Instead of using the absolute Galois group of k, one can use the absolute Weil group, which has a natural map to the Galois group and therefore also acts on the root datum. The corresponding semidirect product is called the Weil form of the L-group. *For algebraic groups G over finite fields, Deligne and Lusztig introduced a different dual group. As before, G gives a root datum with an action of the absolute Galois group of the finite field. The dual group G* is then the reductive algebraic group over the finite field associated to the dual root datum with the induced action of the Galois group. (This dual group is defined over a finite field, while the component of the Langlands dual group is defined over the complex numbers.) Applications The Langlands conjectures imply, very roughly, that if G is a reductive algebraic group over a local or global field, then there is a correspondence between \\"good\\" representations of G and homomorphisms of a Galois group (or Weil group or Langlands group) into the Langlands dual group of G. A more general formulation of the conjectures is Langlands functoriality, which says (roughly) that given a (well behaved) homomorphism between Langlands dual groups, there should be an induced map between \\"good\\" representations of the corresponding groups. To make this theory explicit, there must be defined the concept of L-homomorphism of an L-group into another. That is, L-groups must be made into a category, so that 'functoriality' has meaning. The definition on the complex Lie groups is as expected, but L-homomorphisms must be 'over' the Weil group. References *A.

This was a concept album of sorts, as Bing covered some of his musical rivals' big hits, such as Al Jolson's \\"April Showers\\" and Nat King Cole's \\"Mona Lisa\\". The jazz historian Will Friedwald wrote that the album \\"was essentially Crosby's way of acknowledging that he wasn't the only male singer to create hits and standards\\". Crosby recorded the songs in April 1956 in Los Angeles, with orchestrations by arranger Jack Pleis. Longtime record producer Milt Gabler came up with the concept. All 12 tracks from Songs I Wish I Had Sung were released by Sepia Records on the 2011 CD Through the Years: Volume Nine (1955). Bing Crosby Enterprises and Universal Music issued a deluxe, 22-track version of Songs I Wish I Had Sung in 2014 which added many radio tracks to the original LP.

At the time, as Under Secretary of the Navy, Livingstone oversaw a large management portfolio, which included lawyers in the Navy General Counsel's office and investigators at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service who raised concerns about the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Livingstone is a native of Carthage, Missouri and grew up in an Air Force family. She graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1968 with an A.B. degree and completed an M.A. in political science at the University of Montana in 1972. She also holds a graduate degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Livingstone served at the Veterans Administration from 1981 to 1989 in a number of positions, including Associate Deputy Administrator for Logistics and the Associate Deputy Administrator for Management. Prior to her Executive Branch service, Livingstone worked for more than nine years in the Legislative branch on the personal staffs of both a Senator and two Congressmen. From 1989 to 1993, during the George H. W. Bush administration, Livingstone served as Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment). In that position, her responsibilities included military construction, installation management, energy and environmental issues, domestic disaster relief and restoration of public infrastructure to the people of Kuwait following Operation Desert Storm. From 1993 to 1998, Livingstone worked for the American Red Cross as Vice President of Health and Safety Services, as Acting Senior Vice President for Chapter Services, and as a consultant for Armed Forces Emergency Services. Prior to being nominated as the Under Secretary of the Navy, she had held the post of CEO of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) and deputy chairman of its Council of Trustees. She also served as a vice president and a member of the Board of the Procurement Round Table, as well as a consultant on policy and management issues. Livingstone served as Under Secretary of the Navy from July 26, 2001 to February 28, 2003. As the Under Secretary of the Navy, Livingstone was cited by General Counsel of the United States Navy, Alberto J. Mora for revoking Department of Defense regulations, authorized by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, that allowed the use of coercive interrogation techniques on detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. After the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Director David Brandt briefed Mora on alleged maltreatment of detainees at Guantanamo, Mora says he turned to Livingstone after his appeals to the Department of Defense General Counsel's office failed. In a memorandum to Navy investigators, Mora wrote of a January 3, 2003 meeting with Livingstone that \\"this was the first of almost daily conversations or meetings that I had with Under Secretary Livingstone on [detainee interrogation]. Her views and mine [in opposition to the treatment and policy] coincided, and she provided great support ...\\" On January 15, 2003, Rumsfeld suspended authority for the approved interrogation techniques. Since leaving the Navy, Livingstone has worked as a policy management consultant and has served as a member of the National Security Studies Board of Advisors, a board member of the Procurement Round Table and the NASA Return-to-Flight Task Group for safe return of Space Shuttle flights.

He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993. Early life Gilmer was born in Birmingham, Alabama, where he attended and played high school football at Woodlawn High School. Gilmer often utilized the technique of leaping high into the air to pass the ball because, as a child, he often played pickup games with teammates who were much older and thus taller than he was; Gilmer was then one of the first players to popularize the \\"jump pass\\" when he continued using the technique at the collegiate level.Groom, 2000, p. 79. College career After high school, Gilmer played college football at the University of Alabama, where he was the left halfback from 1944 to 1947.

He had 79 rushing attempts with an average gain of 7.0 yards and a passing percentage of .648 on 88 attempts. His total offense, 1,457 yards, was second in the nation. Gilmer also spent time as a punter and kickoff returner and, in his junior year, he returned 37 punts; his average, 14.5 yards, led the nation. During that season, Gilmer led Alabama to the 1946 Rose Bowl, where they beat the University of Southern California 34‚Äì14. In his career Gilmer passed for 26 touchdowns and ran for 24. He passed for 2,894 yards and rushed for 1,673. His punting average was 36.4 yards. He averaged 28.7 yards on kickoff returns, 13.5 on punt returns.

She met and married the actor-producer Seymour Hicks in 1893, and the two collaborated on many projects for the stage and screen. The daughter of the actor William Terriss, Ellaline made her London stage debut at the age of 16 in Cupid's Messenger at London's Haymarket Theatre. Impressed with her performance, the producer Charles Wyndham gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in Why Women Weep. In 1892 Terriss starred in Faithful James (by B. C. Stephenson) and the following year she starred in the title role of Cinderella, produced by Henry Irving. She was featured in W. S. Gilbert's His Excellency in 1894, followed the next year by a starring role in the George Edwardes production of the musical The Shop Girl, playing alongside her husband. The next year she starred in another musical hit, The Circus Girl. In 1897, her father was murdered by a deranged actor. As a result, she received much public sympathy, returning to the stage to star in A Runaway Girl in 1898, one of her most successful shows. In the 1900s, she starred in a series of long-running hits, including Bluebell in Fairyland (1901), Quality Street (1902), The Catch of the Season (1905) and The Beauty of Bath (1906). After 1910, Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours. Her unsuccessful return to musical comedy, Cash on Delivery (1917), confirmed the wisdom of this new career course. Her later career also included film roles. She began in the silent films Scrooge and David Garrick (both from 1913) and made a successful transfer to talkies; her last film was The Four Just Men in 1939. She died in Hampstead, England, at the age of 100. Early life Terriss was born in Port Stanley, Falkland Islands.Taylor, C.M.P. Terriss, Ellaline. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 7 January 2012. Her father, William Lewin, became a well-known actor in London under the name William Terriss. He loved the adventurous, outdoor life, and had previously tried his hand at various professions, including farmer, merchant seaman and silver miner. Shortly after Ellaline's birth, he gave up farming and moved his family back to England where, because of his swashbuckling style, was known as \\"Breezy Bill\\".Bartlett, Steve. \\"'A fairy, elfish thing' - Ellaline Terriss\\", The Stage, 16 November 2005; accessed 10 April 2012. Her brother Tom became an actor and then a well-known film director. Her mother Isabel (n√©e Lewis) also acted under the stage name Amy Fellowes.Smythe, Arthur J.

In 1887, she appeared in pantomime at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool.Broadbent, pp. 319‚Äì20 Petite, pretty and talented, she attracted the praise of both critics and the public. She came to the attention of Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who signed her to make her professional London debut in the role of Mary Herbert in Cupid's Messenger, in 1888 at the Haymarket Theatre. Impressed by this performance, Charles Wyndham gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in Why Women Weep. She also attracted the attention of a promising young actor, Seymour Hicks, and they married in 1893. In 1892, Terriss starred in Faithful James, by B.C.

They brought this production to America under the management of George Edwardes. The following season, Terriss played a supporting role in the W.S. Gilbert and Frank Osmond Carr comic opera His Excellency. In 1895, Terriss was a replacement in the original London production of George Edwardes's hit, The Shop Girl, joining her husband as co-star. They toured America in 1895, where they befriended the American novelist Richard Harding Davis. At the instance of Gilbert, Hicks wrote a drama called One of the Best, a vehicle for Terriss's father William Terriss at the Adelphi Theatre, based on the famous Dreyfus trial. The Hickses were frequent guests of Gilbert at his estate in Grim's Dyke. Terriss next played the title role, May, in My Girl (1896 at the Gaiety).Hollingshead, p. 74 Another early success for the young couple was The Circus Girl (1896; Terriss made Lionel Monckton's song, \\"A Simple Little String\\" into a major hit). =Tragedy and triumph= Illustration from Bluebell in Fairyland In December 1897, while Terriss was still playing in The Circus Girl, two tragedies befell her. Her father was stabbed to death by a deranged and disgruntled unemployed actor, Richard Archer Prince, as he was about to enter the stage door of the Royal Adelphi Theatre. Her mother died shortly afterwards. The murder, and Prince's trial, filled the country's newspapers for weeks. Already the most popular couple on the London stage, Terriss and Hicks received an outpouring of sympathy. They moved on, becoming even more famous over the next decade. She next starred in the title role of a new show co-authored by Hicks, A Runaway Girl (1898), which became one of the Gaiety Theatre's most successful shows. This was followed by With Flying Colours (1899). The couple adopted a daughter, Mabel, in 1889, and Terriss gave birth to another child, Betty, in 1904. In early 1900, the Hickses played in their only Broadway show together, My Daughter-in-law, at the Frohman brothers' old Lyceum Theatre.My Daughter- in-law, IBDB, accessed April 11, 2012 They then joined forces with the producer Charles Frohman and, in his company over a period of seven years, they played the leads in a series of musicals written by Hicks, including: Bluebell in Fairyland (1901), which was continually revived as a Christmas entertainment for the next four decades; The Cherry Girl (1902); The Beauty of Bath (1906), which opened the Hicks Theatre (later renamed the Globe) and included additional lyrics by a newcomer, P.G. Wodehouse, and music by Jerome Kern, which became one of Terriss's best-loved roles; and The Gay Gordons (1907). Hicks and Terriss also starred in J.M. Barrie's play Quality Street in 1902. At that time, they moved to a new home, the Old Forge, at Merstham, Surrey. Their cul-de-sac was renamed \\"Quality Street\\".Nairn, Ian and Nikolaus Pevsner. Surrey, p. 361, The Buildings of England series, Yale University Press (1962; 2nd Ed. 1971) =Later career= Terriss with daughter Betty The couple performed constantly, both in London and on tour in America, except when Terriss was pregnant with Betty. In 1905, Terriss took over the role of Angela in her husband's The Catch of the Season, which had been created by Zena Dare during Terriss's pregnancy. Later Terriss ceded the role to Dare's sister, Phyllis. In 1907, Terriss reduced the grueling acting schedule she had kept up for almost twenty years. She did continue to appear in a limited number of plays, including The Dashing Little Duke (1909; with C. Hayden Coffin, Courtice Pounds and Louie Pounds), which was less successful. She played the title role in that production (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role - possibly the only case in the history of the musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role.Lamb, Andrew. Leslie Stuart: The Man Who Composed Florodora, pp. 206‚Äì209, London: Routledge After the failure of Captain Kidd (1910), Hicks and Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours, including a tour of South Africa in 1911 and later a tour of France following the outbreak of World War I, to give concerts to British troops at the front. Their unsuccessful return to musical comedy, Cash on Delivery (1917), confirmed the wisdom of their new career course. After 1917, Terriss returned to the stage only on special occasions. In December 1925, she appeared at the Lyceum with her husband in The Man in Dress Clothes, a French farce he had translated and in which their daughter made her stage debut. It was intended only to run for a short season, but it was such a success that its run was extended. \\"The Theatre World\\" reported in January 1926: =Film career= Terriss, c. 1896 Terriss appeared in over a dozen British films, generally in which her husband was involved as an actor, writer or director. These included the silent films Scrooge (1913), David Garrick (1913), Flame of Passion (1915), A Woman of the World (1916), Masks and Faces (1918), Always Tell Your Wife (1923), Land of Hope and Glory (1927) and Blighty (1927).\\"Terriss, Ellaline\\", British Film Institute; accessed 7 January 2012. She made a successful transition to talkies, including Atlantic (1929), A Man of Mayfair (1931), Glamour (1931), The Iron Duke (1934), Royal Cavalcade (1935) and The Four Just Men (1939). =Retirement and death= In 1940, Terriss and Hicks went to the Middle East with \\"ENSA\\", to entertain the British troops in World War II. After the war, Terriss retired from the stage. She and Hicks moved to South Africa, where she took up painting and was tutored by the marine artist George Pilkington. So good were her works that an exhibition was held at Foyle's Art Gallery, London, in February 1959. Hicks, who was knighted in 1935, died in 1949, and Terriss survived him by 22 years. She was the subject of an episode of This Is Your Life in 1962 when host Eamonn Andrews surprised her while she was sketching in the garden of her home in Richmond, Surrey.\\"Ellaline Terriss\\", Big Red Book, accessed July 14, 2015 Terriss died at the Holy Family Nursing Home, Hampstead, London, at the age of 100 as a result of a hip fracture sustained during a fall.

An opponent of the British East India Company during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, information concerning her is sparse and mostly comes from folklore. Through this she is claimed to have been a member of the Lodhi caste and has been used as an icon in LODHI politics in the 21st century.  British interference  Said in folklore to be a member of the Lodhi caste, Avantibai was the queen of Lakshman Singh of Ramgarh estate, which now lies in Dindori district, Madhya Pradesh. Upon the death of her husband in 1851, Avantibai attempted to act as regent for her son, Vikramjeet Singh, who was a minor. The British authorities did not accept this and the Court of Wards appointed an administrator to oversee his affairs.  Indian rebellion of 1857  When the revolt of 1857 broke out, Avantibai raised and led an army of 4000. Her first battle with the British took place in the village of Kheri near Mandla, where she and her army were able to defeat the British forces. However, stung by the defeat the British came back with vengeance and launched an attack on Ramgarh. Avantibai moved to the hills of Devharigarh for safety. The British army set fire to Ramgarh, and turned to Devhargarh to attack the queen. Avantibai resorted to guerilla warfare to fend of the British army. She took the sword from guards sword snd pierced it into herself and thus committing suicide on 20 March 1858 when facing almost certain defeat in battle.  Legacy  After independence, Avantibai has been remembered through performances and folklore. A folk song of the Gondi people, an adivasi tribe of the region, says: She is among the viranganas (heroic women) lauded by Dalit groups as part of an invented tradition surrounding the events of 1857, other examples of whom include Asha Devi, Jhalkari Bai, Mahabiri Devi and Uda Devi. Charu Gupta notes of these traditions that \\"scattered, often thin, evidence is cited and quoted by Dalits repeatedly\\". Although little is known of Avantibai except through folklore, her story merited a brief inclusion in the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) history textbooks from 2012 as a participant in the 1857 rebellion, after parliamentary protests from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The BSP, in particular, had been using the story of Avantibai, along with accounts of other Dalit folk heroines, as a means to promote the image of Mayawati, with her biographer, Ajoy Bose, noting that she is cast as their \\"modern avatar\\". The Narmada Valley Development Authority named a part of the Bargi Dam project in Jabalpur in her honour.

The protocol builds upon the 4:2:2 digital video encoding parameters defined in ITU-R Recommendation BT.601, which provides interlaced video data, streaming each field separately, and uses the YCbCr color space and a 13.5 MHz sampling frequency for pixels. The standard can be implemented to transmit either 8-bit values (the standard in consumer electronics) or 10-bit values (sometimes used in studio environments). Both a parallel and a serial transmission format are defined. For the parallel format, a 25-pin D-Sub connector pinout and ECL logic levels are defined. The serial format can be transmitted over 75-ohm coaxial cable with BNC connectors, but there is also a fibre-optical version defined. The parallel version of the ITU-R BT.656 protocol is also used in many TV sets between chips using CMOS logic levels. Typical applications include the interface between a PAL/NTSC decoder chip and a DAC integrated circuit for driving a CRT in a TV set.  Data format  A BT.656 data stream is a sequence of 8-bit or 10-bit words, transmitted at a rate of 27 Mword/s. Horizontal scan lines of video pixel data are delimited in the stream by 4-byte long SAV (Start of Active Video) and EAV (End of Active Video) code sequences. SAV codes also contain status bits indicating line position in a video field or frame. Line position in a full frame can be determined by tracking SAV status bits, allowing receivers to 'synchronize' with an incoming stream. Individual pixels in a line are coded in YCbCr format. After an SAV code (4 bytes) is sent, the first 8 bits of Cb (chroma U) data are sent then 8 bits of Y (luma), followed by 8 bits of Cr (chroma V) for the next pixel and then 8 bits of Y. To reconstruct full resolution Y, Cb, Cr pixel values, chroma upsampling must be used.

It is an adaptation of Semb√®ne's 1973 novel of the same name. The film depicts El Hadji, a businessman in Senegal, who is cursed with crippling erectile dysfunction upon the day of his marriage to his third wife. The film satirizes the corruption in African post-independence governments; El Hadji's impotence symbolizes the failure of such governments to be useful at all. Plot El Hadji Abdoukader Beye, a Senegalese businessman and a Muslim, takes on a third wife, thereby demonstrating his social and economic success. On the wedding night he discovers that he is incapable of consummating the marriage; he has become impotent. At the beginning, he suspects that one or both of his first two wives have put the spell on him, without realizing that he walks by the true guilty party every day (beggars and people he has stolen from). The film criticizes the African leaders' attitude after Independence, underlining their greed and their inability to step away from foreign influences.FCAT  Characters  * El Hadji Abdoukader Beye, a Senegalese businessman * Rama, Beye's daughter with his first wife * Adja Awa Astou, Beye's first wife * Oumi Ndoye, the second wife * Ngon√©, the third wife * Modu, El Hadji's chauffeur * S√©rigne Mada, a marabout * The president of the chamber of commerce * Dupont-Durand, the president's chaperone ReleaseReception=Critical reception Criticism = Scholar Aaron Mushengyezi writes: \\"I posit that in Xala, he evokes two problematic binary oppositions: between the corruption and decadence of foreign influence and the purity and morality of African tradition, the former represented as 'corrupting' and the latter 'redemptive'; and between strong, revolutionary 'masculine' women and villainous, weak, 'feminine' men.\\" Another scholarly perspective is from Harriet D. Lyons: \\"I shall argue that in Sembene's work the \\"covertness\\" of the folk material takes the form of suppression of detail combined with the retention of essential values. Sembene is thereby able to use folk elements in such a way as to give the work political implications that go well beyond the preservation and/or revival of a local tradition.

Bing Sings Whilst Bregman Swings was a stylistic departure for Crosby, marking the first time he recorded an album with an orchestra similar to Songs for Swingin' Lovers! by Frank Sinatra, an album recorded with Nelson Riddle and released earlier the same year by Capitol Records. The songs are also among the few that Crosby had never recorded. Buddy Bregman contributed the orchestrations, conducted a hand-picked group of Hollywood's foremost musicians, and came up with the idea of the album. In an interview with In Tune International magazine in 2001, Bregman said, \\"Yes, this was my idea. Bing was at the end of his long contract with Decca, and although he re-signed, it was on a non-exclusive basis, which meant he was free to record with whom he chose. I'd recently worked with Gary Crosby on a Decca session and become friendly with him and I had Bing's private home telephone number so I rang him to ask about doing an album with me at Verve. I went over to the house and played some things over to him on the piano. He agreed to do it and a deal was worked out, and I was given carte blanche with the arrangements and musicians. He didn't even insist on his regular pianist Buddy Cole being on the date. The only thing Bing stipulated was that he had to record at nine o'clock in the morning, because his voice was best at that time of day.\\" The album was released on CD by Verve in 2001. Reception A reviewer for Variety wrote, \\"Bing Crosby's first wax trip away from Decca in more than 20 years is a happy musical excursion...Altogether it is quite a musical package - muscular and tender, driving and romantic, pulsating and lyrical. For Bing Crosby, the artist, it is a somewhat different testament to add to the many already on record and, as you will hear, an ingeniously varied and durable one.\\" Billboard liked it, too, saying, \\"This is Bing's first album on Verve, and he draws support from a modern, swinging group of musicians. ‚Äì The package contains a list of great tunes which Bing never recorded before; reason enough to make this attractive to the faithful. Tunes include 'Mountain Greenery', 'Blue Room', 'Have You Met Miss Jones', and other great ones, most dating from the golden age of show music. Bregman orchestrated the songs brightly, and Bing sings them with his casual charm and technical perfection.\\" In its review Time magazine said, \\"After 22 years of making records for Decca ‚Äî plus a few before even Decca latched onto him ‚Äî Bing Crosby steps out with a handful of oldies on a new label, proves himself virtually indestructible. It is only when he tries to swing too high that he begins to sound his age (52).\\" Record producer Ken Barnes, wrote, \\"This popular album has been re-issued many times on various labels over the years. As an example of Crosby's art it is something of an enigma. On the one hand the choice of songs is impeccable ‚Äì beautifully written standards like 'They All Laughed,' 'The Song Is You,' 'Have You Met Miss Jones', and 'September in the Rain' and Bing's singing, for the most part, is exemplary. But, on the other hand, it is very difficult to accept Buddy Bregman seriously as a reliable orchestral accompanist. His writing can be reasonably tasteful on tracks like 'They All Laughed,' 'Mountain Greenery', and 'The Blue Room', but his brass scoring is ham‚Äìfisted and bitterly distracting in 'Cheek to Cheek' and 'I've Got Five Dollars'. And one wonders how Bing ever managed to stay on pitch in the middle of 'Heat Wave' where Bregman has the orchestra playing suspect chords. Despite all these faults, it was refreshing at the time to hear Crosby with a modern-sounding orchestra and while this album is no match for Sinatra's 'Songs for Swingin' Lovers' classic LP, it was a step ‚Äì albeit a hesitant one ‚Äì in the right direction.\\" Track listingPersonnel Conrad Gozzo, Pete Candoli, Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, Maynard Ferguson (trumpets); Francis Howard, George Ulyate, Milt Bernhardt, George Roberts (trombones); Bud Shank, Maurice Stein, Ted Nash, Bob Cooper, Chuck Gentry (saxophones); Paul Smith (piano); Barney Kessel (guitar); Joe Mondragon (bass); Alvin Stoller (drums).

The estimated population of Woss and the Nimpkish Valley is 200. The town of Woss lies about 3 km north of Woss Lake, a long, narrow lake stretching about 10 km in a primarily north-south direction with a maximum width of about one km, the southern portion of which is part of Woss Lake Provincial Park. Woss is a member municipality of the Regional District of Mount Waddington, which also includes Alert Bay, Port Alice, Port McNeill, Hyde Creek, Coal Harbour, Holberg, Malcolm Island, Quatsino and Port Hardy. Woss has regular telephone service, and acquired cellular phone services in early 2016. Woss had one elementary school for many years, that was closed up after its 2015-2016 school year. Until the mid 1960s, Woss was accessible only by rail from Beaver Cove on the Englewood Railway. During this time, most of the loggers were housed in bunkhouses heated with wood-fired steam. One of the original steam powered locomotives is currently used as a working tourist attraction. Nearby Woss Lake is the main summer recreational playground for Woss residents and the original community campground at the lake is now Woss Lake Provincial Park. Tage Wickstrom, the school principal until his death in 1986, built the only 440 dirt oval track and field on the north island at his school in Woss. For many years Woss Lake School hosted all of the track and field competitions for School District #85 which included communities from Woss to Port Hardy. The track and field are now known as the \\"Tage Wickstrom Track and Field\\" in honour of the educator who built them. Geology Woss is on the dividing line between a pluton of Jurassic granodiorite and a mass of Triassic basalt; mountains to the north are basaltic while ranges to the west, south and east are mostly granitic. Surficial deposits in the community are coarse with abundant gravel and stones. Muller, J.E. and Roddick, J.A. (1980). Geology Alert Bay - Cape Scott Map 1552A. Ottawa: Geological Survey of Canada.

It was formerly the residence of the Heungseon Daewongun a prince regent of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century, and father of Emperor Gojong. Gojong himself also lived in this residence until age 12 when he assumed the throne. It is currently a museum and is open to the public free of charge. History thumb thumb The site dates from the 14th century. Early buildings were damaged or destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598), but some of the early construction remains. Under the direction of Queen Mother Jo, Unhyeongung was converted into a grander complex with four gates. Although the residential complex was taken from the Heungseon Daewongun's descendants under Japanese colonial rule, it was returned in 1948, and in 1993 they sold it to the Seoul government. It subsequently underwent three years of renovations to restore it to its earlier appearance. Today's complex is smaller than its previous extent, as Duksung Women's University now occupies part of its grounds, as well as other smaller businesses including Unhyeon Kindergarten and Byeolhadang hanok guesthouse. The remaining complex includes: Structures Some of the interiors have been refurnished, and contain mannequins dressed in typical clothing styles for various stations of life in Korean history. The complex also contains a small museum. The residence is open to the publicÔºåfree of charge. =Norakdang Hall= Norakdang is the largest building within the complex and is the site of wedding of King Gojong and Empress Myeongseong. Norakdang also was as one of the two residence buildings for women. The most notable structure inside Norakdang is the kitchen, which was most likely used for food preparation when hosting important events. The hall held many important events such as birthday parties and related ceremonies. A reenactment of a traditional wedding ceremony continues to be held at Norakdang. Sujiksa at Unhyeongung =Noandang Hall= Noandang was where the Heungseon Daewongun received his guests and also served as the leisure quarters for the men. The hall was not just a place of leisure and entertainment. The Heungseon Daewongun, as the father of a young Emperor, carried out all his business from Noandang. =Irodang Hall= Irodang is one of two woman's residences on the residence complex. =Sujiksa= Sujiksa is a small row of rooms to the right from the entrance.

He created monumental works of sculpture for the Jesuits and the Dominicans and found himself centre stage of the two most prestigious artistic campaigns of his era, the Altar of Saint Ignatius of Loyola in the Ges√π and the cycle of the twelve huge Apostle statues in the nave of the Lateran basilica. Le Gros' handling of the marble attracted powerful patrons like the papal treasurer Lorenzo Corsini (much later to become Pope Clement XII) and Cardinal de Bouillon, as Dean of the Sacred College the highest ranking cardinal. He also played a prominent role in more intimate settings like the chapel of the Monte di Piet√† and the Cappella Antamori in San Girolamo della Carit√†, both little treasures of the Roman late baroque not known to many because they are difficult to access. Le Gros was the most exuberant baroque sculptor of all his contemporaries but eventually lost his long battle for artistic dominance to a prevailing classicist tendency against which he fought in vain. Name and family While he himself always signed as Le Gros and is referred to in this way in all legal documents, it has become common practice in the 19th and 20th centuries to spell the name Legros. Scholars frequently add a suffix like 'the Younger' or 'Pierre II'Fran√ßois Souchal, French Sculptors of the 17th and 18th Centuries. The Reign of Louis XIV, vol. II, Oxford (Cassirer) 1981, vol. IV, London (Faber) 1993. to distinguish him from his father, Pierre Le Gros the Elder, who was also a sculptor of renown to the French king Louis XIV. Le Gros was born in Paris into a family with a strong artistic pedigree. Jeanne, his mother, died when he was three, but he stayed in close contact with her brothers, the sculptors Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy, whose workshop he frequented and eventually inherited at the age of fifteen.Thomas Hedin, The Sculpture of Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy, Columbia (University of Missouri Press) 1983, pp. 232‚Äì233. His initial training as a sculptor lay in the hands of his father while he learned drawing from the engraver Jean Le Pautre, the uncle of his stepmother, Marie Le Pautre. His half brother Jean (1671‚Äì1745) was to become a portrait painter.Legros (Le Gros), Jean, in: Ulrich Thieme, Felix Becker (editors): Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart, XXII, Leipzig (E. A. Seemann) 1928, p. 575. Student Vetturie, 1692‚Äì1695, Paris, Tuileries Garden As a student of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture Le Gros was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome to study at the French Academy in Rome, where he arrived in 1690. There, he renewed his close friendship with his cousin Pierre Lepautre, also a sculptor, and struck a friendship with the Academy's other fellow, the architect Gilles-Marie Oppenordt.Anatole de Montaiglon and Jules Guiffrey (eds.), Correspondance des directeurs de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie de France √† Rome avec les surintendants des b√¢timents, vol. I-XVIII, Paris 1887‚Äì1912. His time there from 1690‚Äì1695 was fruitful but not untroubled. The academy was plagued by a constant financial crisis, and the premises at the Palazzo Capranica were also a rather ramshackle affair, far from the grandeur the academy would later enjoy after a move in the 18th century to the Palazzo Mancini under the directorship of Le Gros' friend Nicolas Vleughels, and eventually to the Villa Medici. Keen to prove himself by carving a marble copy of an antique statue, after much lobbying Le Gros was eventually granted permission to do so by the director of the academy Matthieu de La Teuli√®re and his superior in Paris, √âdouard Colbert de Villacerf. His model was the then so-called Vetturie, an ancient sculpture then in the garden of the Villa Medici in Rome (today in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence), chosen by La Teuli√®re as a good example for female Roman dress ‚Äì which Le Gros, nevertheless, improved upon following La Teuli√®re's instructions, by introducing dress details found in engravings after Raphael. Finished in 1695, she was finally shipped to Marly some twenty years later and came to Paris in 1722 where she was placed in the Tuileries Garden. Early independence=The chapel of Saint Ignatius= In the same year 1695, Le Gros took part in a competition for a marble group to be placed on the altar of Saint Ignatius of Loyola which the Jesuit Order was erecting to its founder in their Roman mother church Il Ges√π. The enterprise turned out to be the most ambitious and prestigious sculptural project Rome saw in decades.Pio Pecchiai, Il Ges√π di Roma, Rome 1952, pp. 139‚Äì196 (in Italian). The altar's architecture was designed by Andrea Pozzo who also provided oil paintings of the sculptures and reliefs as guides to their composition while leaving the details to the individual sculptors. Religion Overthrowing Heresy Le Gros' participation was mediated by the French engraver Nicholas Dorigny and was to be kept strictly secret. Only after being firmly commissioned (his contract is also signed by Dorigny as a witness) was Le Gros allowed to tell the French Academy's director. La Teuli√®re took the news with surprise, told him off for his disloyalty to his benefactor, the French king, and saw no other choice than to dismiss him from the French Academy, but did continue to support him. At the same time, La Teuli√®re could not help being a little proud of his prot√©g√© who managed to beat the cream of sculptors in Rome. In particular he stressed that the models the much older Jean-Baptiste Th√©odon submitted for the pendant group had to be corrected several times while Le Gros' model (today in Montpellier, Mus√©e Fabre) was spot on from the outset. Le Gros' subject was Religion Overthrowing Heresy, a dynamic group of four over-lifesize marble figures on the altar's right hand side. With her cross and a bundle of flames, the towering Religion, meaning Catholic religion, drives out heresy, personified by an old woman tearing her hair and a falling man with a serpent. To leave no doubt as to who specifically are considered heretics, three books bear the names of Luther, Calvin and Zwingli, whose book is torn apart by a putto. Le Gros based the facial expressions on examples for the passions developed by Charles Le Brun. While the figure of Religion appears like a statue, the old woman melts into the wall decoration, the man tips over the edge of the architectural framework towards the spectator and the snake, an anecdotal detail very typical for Le Gros, hisses directly at the viewer. This work has always been compared to Th√©odon's counterpart Triumph of Faith over Idolatry, carved in a much more classicising, rigid style. The rivalry between the two Frenchmen was to play out repeatedly over the next few years. The sheer panache and virtuosity of this group launched Le Gros' career. He was in great demand and, indeed, the busiest sculptor in Rome at the time. Silver statue of St. Ignatius In 1697, with his group nearly complete, he won the competition for the altar's main image, the silver statue of St. Ignatius. It was a peculiar competition as the twelve sculptors taking part had to decide the winner themselves by pointing out the best model of their competitors. When Le Gros' victory was announced his compatriots were ecstatic and carried him through the streets in triumph. The statue was cast in silver by Johann Friedrich Ludwig and finished in 1699. A century later it fell victim to an act of barbarism when, in 1798, it was dismantled and the head, arms and legs as well as the accompanying angels melted down for their material value during the Roman Republic. Le Gros' chasuble was left intact and the missing parts remade with slight variations in silver coated plaster from 1803‚Äì04 under the supervision of Antonio Canova by one of his assistants. =Other early works for the Jesuits and Dominicans= At the same time, Le Gros was already busy with another major Jesuit commission for the monumental altar relief of the Apotheosis of the Blessed Luigi Gonzaga in the church of Sant'Ignazio (1697‚Äì99). This altar was also designed by Pozzo, and Le Gros again had a great deal of freedom to elaborate on the composition. Building on an early idea of Pozzo's, which envisages a statue instead of a relief, Le Gros carved the figure of the saint nearly fully in the round. A superbly fine polish brings out the whiteness of the statuesque saint and gives it emphasis in the centre of the elaborately detailed relief. He also started his extensive work for Antonin Cloche, the Master of the Dominicans. Apart from also being a Frenchman, Cloche was probably introduced to the sculptor by his secretary, the painter and Dominican friar Baptiste Monnoyer, who was a friend of Le Gros' at the Acad√©mie Royale in Paris. With the canonisation process initiated, Cloche commissioned the Sarcophagus for Pope Pius V (1697‚Äì98) of verde antico marble which was to be integrated into the existing papal tomb monument in the Cappella Sistina in Santa Maria Maggiore. Its main function is to contain the saint's body and make it visible to the faithful for veneration on limited occasions. Usually, however, it was to be hidden by a flap made of gilded bronze which bears his effigy in very shallow relief. To fulfil all these concurrent commissions Le Gros required assistants and a suitable workshop. With the help of the Jesuits, he had found an ideal space in 1695 in a back wing of the Palazzo Farnese which he was to occupy for all his life.Olivier Michel, L‚ÄôAccademia, in: Le Palais Farn√®se, Rome 1981, Vol. I/2, pp. 567‚Äì609, in particular pp. 572‚Äì579 (in French). High hopes The Arts Paying Tribute to Pope Clement XI, 1702, Rome, Accademia di San Luca. All his work so far as an independent master had a clearly defined deadline: the celebrations of the Holy Year 1700. =Married life= In 1701, Le Gros married a young woman from Paris, Marie Petit. She died in June 1704 leaving Le Gros with his first son (a second son only lived for a week) who was in need of a mother. So he immediately married again in October 1704. His bride was another French woman, Marie-Charlotte, daughter of the outgoing director of the French Academy in Rome, Ren√©-Antoine Houasse. Witness to this wedding was Vleughels who at the time lived at Le Gros' studio. The couple was to have two daughters and a son (Filippo Juvarra was his godfather in 1712) who lived to be adults while his first son with Marie Petit died as a child in 1710. =Pope Clement XI= At the end of the year 1700, it fell to Cardinal de Bouillon as the longest serving cardinal to consecrate his friend, the art loving Giovanni Francesco Albani, as Pope Clement XI. The many years of papal frugality were over, and Le Gros decided that this was the time to be ambitious. Elected a member of the Accademia di San Luca in 1700, he presented the terracotta relief The Arts Paying Tribute to Pope Clement XI as his reception piece in 1702. The iconography of this flattering scene was telling and unmistakably expressed the high hopes Le Gros had for the patronage of the newly elected pontiff. =Antonin Cloche as patron= He also remained the sculptor of choice for Cloche who was eager to promote the status of the Dominicans. Following the death of Cloche's friend Cardinal Girolamo Casanate, who left his substantial collection of books and an endowment for expanding his library to the Dominicans, Le Gros was commissioned to create the cardinal's tomb in the Lateran Basilica (1700‚Äì03) and subsequently the Statue of Cardinal Casanate in the Biblioteca Casanatense (1706‚Äì08).Gerhard Schuster, Zu Ehren Casanates. P√®re Cloches Kunstauftr√§ge in der Fr√ºhzeit der Biblioteca Casanatense, in: Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz, Vol. 35, 1991, pp. 323‚Äì336. When the new pope offered the many niches in Saint Peter's to the religious orders to erect an honorary statue to their founders, Cloche jumped at the opportunity and commissioned the Statue of Saint Dominic from Le Gros (1702‚Äì06). It epitomises his dynamic mature style. Since no other religious order saw the necessity to hurry, Saint Dominic was the very first and for decades the only monumental statue of a founder in Saint Peter's. =Other important commissions= Le Gros also continued to be employed by several branches of the Jesuit order for work such as the statue of St Francis Xavier (1702) in the church of Sant'Apollinare, Rome, \\"a marvel of delicate marble work\\". It shows the saint reunited with his beloved crucifix which was brought back to him by a crab after it had been lost in the sea. The terracotta model in St. Petersburg, Hermitage Museum, presents an alternative idea in which the Jesuit missionary appears much fiercer, probably preaching, with the right arm raised. For the mellower mood displayed in Sant'Apollinare, Le Gros decided on a mirror image of that pose. Also in 1702, the board of the Monte di Piet√† in Rome, presided by the papal treasurer Lorenzo Corsini, continued the steady embellishment of their chapel which already boasted an altar relief by Domenico Guidi and had in time for the Holy Year 1700 found its architectural completion with the dome by Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri. They were now looking to commission two large reliefs for the side walls and made a list of sculptors currently in the limelight. Their choice was to stage another head to head of Le Gros, who was to carve the relief of Tobit Lending Money to Gabael, and Th√©odon, creating its companion piece, Joseph Distributing Grain to the Egyptians, on the opposite wall (both 1702‚Äì05). =Stanislas Kostka= The polychrome statue of Stanislas Kostka on his Deathbed (1702‚Äì03) is today Le Gros's best-known work. Since his normal practice was to evoke naturalistic impressions by an extraordinarily fine surface treatment of a monochrome white marble, this multi-coloured tableau-like depiction is quite untypical for Le Gros. But it would be untypical for any sculptor because it is unique in the history of sculpture on the whole. Unapologetically, the statue was created to emotionally move the visitor in the room where the blessed (soon to be canonised) Jesuit novice died, next to a chapel in the Jesuit novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale. The pope honoured the new devotional site with his visit ‚Äì on foot ‚Äì the day following its inauguration in 1703. The figure still moves to this day, and much of the effect is due to the aura created with the staging. The site is not something one would stumble across by accident like a chapel in a church, one has to seek it out. A visitor would enter the quiet, dimly lit rooms carefully with a sense of apprehension and awe, and then see the striking silhouette of a motionless life size figure on a bed, approachable without a barrier. It is astonishing that one of the first things a first time visitor mentions is that Kostka looks so lifelike when, in fact, the statue couldn't be more artificial. Head, hands, feet and pillows are of white Carrara marble, the thin shirt is of a different white stone and the habit is of a black stone at the time known as \\"paragone\\". The saint's head would originally have been emphasised by a nimbus, he held an image of the Madonna in his left hand and a large crucifix would have extended from his right hand into the crook of his right elbow. Stanislas would be looking at the crucified Christ with eyes already delirious. With the large crucifix missing, an important iconographic dimension is lost today, i.e. the connection between Stanislas and Christ (similar to the statue of St. Francis Xavier of the same time) which would also round up the composition. The mattress, bed cover with bronze fringes and bed step are from coloured ornamental stones common to Roman baroque art but used in a highly original and effective manner. =Bouillon Monument= Le Gros' project for the Tomb Monument for the duc de Bouillon and his family. Detail of an engraving by Beno√Æt Audran the Elder after a drawing by Gilles-Marie Oppenordt, published 1708. At some point after 1697, Le Gros was employed by Emmanuel-Th√©odose de La Tour d'Auvergne, cardinal de Bouillon to create the dynastic monument for his family to be erected in a funerary chapel in Cluny Abbey, of which the cardinal was the abbot. Apart from being a compatriot, Bouillon might have known the sculptor through the Jesuits as he habitually lived as their guest in the Jesuit novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale. Le Gros's work was completed by 1707 and sent to Cluny, where it arrived in 1709. He worked on this project in as much a French manner as he ever would and invented a spectacular sepulchral monument, at once continuing in the French baroque tradition as well as opening up new formal and iconographic avenues. The chapel was meant to receive several family members, including the cardinal himself, but first and foremost his parents, Fr√©d√©ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon and √âl√©onor de Bergh, Duchesse de Bouillon. Depicted as the main characters in the centre of the monument their grouping and gestures allude to the fact that √âl√©onor was instrumental in converting her husband to catholicism. Another important component was the heart of the duke's brother, the national hero Turenne, enclosed in a heart shaped container of gilded silver and carried towards heaven by a youthful angel who rises from a heraldic tower of white marble which links the family name La Tour to the biblical tower of David. Together with some other sculptures outside the chapel (not planned to be made by Le Gros and, in fact, never executed), the iconographic message was the postulation of a royal rank and sovereignty of the family dating back to the 9th century, the same message Cardinal de Bouillon tried to support by commissioning a written history of his ancestry from the historiographer √âtienne Baluze, published in 1708 and containing an engraving of the envisaged funeral chapel with an idealised view of Le Gros's monument. None of this highly original concept influenced the development of monumental funerary sculpture. Apart from a thorough inspection by royal officials to determine whether they expressed any pretentious dynastic claims, the sculptures were not even unpacked in Cluny due to the fact that Cardinal de Bouillon so completely fell out with his cousin, the Sun King, that he was declared an enemy of the state and all construction stopped. Le Gros' marbles and bronzes were stored, undisturbed in their sealed crates, for nearly 80 years. In the aftermath of the French Revolution they were in danger of being sold as stone material together with Cluny abbey but saved by Alexandre Lenoir who wanted them for his Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais. The animated marble figures of the Duke and Duchess de Bouillon together with the angel (minus Turenne's heart) and a finely detailed relief showing the duke as a battle hero never made it to Paris and are today installed at the H√¥tel-Dieu in Cluny. A fragment of the heraldic tower is kept in the granary of the abbey.See also: Mary Jackson Harvey, Death and Dynasty in the Bouillon Tomb Commissions, in: Art Bulletin 74, June 1992, pp. 272‚Äì296. =Lateran Apostles= At the end of 1702, Pope Clement XI announced his intention to finally have Borromini's colossal niches in the Lateran basilica filled with twelve heroic-scaled figures of the Apostles. Clement's idea was very similar to filling the niches of St. Peter's initiated at the same time: get your church embellished but find others to pay for it. So, he called on prelates and princes to sponsor individual statues but handed the task to choose sculptors to a committee created to run the project. The statue of St. Peter he intended to finance himself and had Th√©odon commissioned. Like Th√©odon, Le Gros was given not only one but two statues: Saint Bartholomew (1703‚Äì12) who displays his own flayed skin, sponsored by the pope's treasurer Lorenzo Corsini, and Saint Thomas (1703‚Äì11), sponsored by King Peter II of Portugal. From the outset it was recognised that the overall unity of all the Apostle statues was of paramount importance. The architect Carlo Fontana acted as a consultant to work out an appropriate size of the proposed sculptures and, more importantly, the ageing painter Carlo Maratti, the pope's favourite artist, was given the task to achieve a stylistic unity by preparing drawings for each statue which were then given to the sculptors as a guideline. This forced submission enraged many of them who, in 1703, voiced their discontent, Th√©odon even resigned because of it, eventually returning to France in 1705.. Le Gros went one step further and decided to challenge Maratti's authority by submitting a model which was radically different from the latter's sober, classicising style. With his model for Saint Thomas from around 1703‚Äì04, the most intricate and detailed terracotta he ever produced, he harked back to the highly emotional baroque of Gianlorenzo Bernini's St. Longinus. He was undoubtedly aware that, if he prevailed and his model was accepted by the pope's committee, all the other sculptors would have to follow suit stylistically. So this, in effect, was Le Gros' attempt to establish himself as the artistic leader of the Eternal City. His model was not approved and the Late Baroque classicism, as WittkowerRudolf Wittkower, Art and Architecture in Italy 1600‚Äì1750 (The Pelican History of Art), Harmondsworth (5th ed.) 1982, p. 436. calls it, prevailed. While Le Gros was the only sculptor who was not held to work from drawings by Maratti, he must have been forced into an act of self-censorship. While essentially the same figure, each and every exuberance was ironed out in his monumental marble figure: the drapery is more ordered, the head lost its visionary vigour, the unruly pages of the book gave way to a carpenter's square, the naturalistic rock became a flat plinth, the weathered tomb stone turned pristine and, of course, the putto vanished. A dynamic group of a saint with a putto in the landscape became a solid statue in a niche. While Le Gros was put in his place, he was not down and out. When it transpired that the undistinguished Florentine sculptor Antonio Andreozzi would not finish his Saint James the Greater, efforts were made in 1713 to win over Louis XIV to take on the patronage and employ Le Gros, but to no avail. Later works Monument of Pope Gregory XV and his cardinal-nephew Ludovico Ludovisi, c. 1709‚Äì14, Rome, Sant'Ignazio Le Gros thrived on playful invention. When, some time between 1706 and 1715, he was asked by the Portuguese ambassador to add heads, hands and legs to a fragmented antique group of Amor and Psyche, he deliberately turned the love story on its head and transformed it to the tale of Caunus and Byblis in which Caunus vehemently defends himself against the sexual advances of his sister. Le Gros' creation quickly became popular and triggered a rafter of drawings, reproductions and copies by for example Pompeo Batoni, Francesco Carradori, Martin Klauer and, best known of all, Laurent Delvaux who carved two marble versions. Le Gros' work soon ended up in Germany where several plaster casts were made. Some time later it was purified back to Amor and Psyche but later destroyed in a fire. The most faithful impression of what it looked like is the plaster cast in Tiefurt House near Weimar.Gerhard Bissell, Haud dubi√® Amoris & Psyches imagines fuerunt statu√¶ ist√¶, in: Max Kunze, Axel R√ºgler (ed.), Wiedererstandene Antike. Erg√§nzungen antiker Kunstwerke seit der Renaissance (Cyriacus. Studien zur Rezeption der Antike, Band 1), Munich 2003, pp. 73‚Äì80. In 1708‚Äì10 Le Gros collaborated with his close friend, the architect Filippo Juvarra, in the creation of the Cappella Antamori in the church of San Girolamo della Carit√†, Rome. His statue of San Filippo Neri is set against a large backlit coloured glass window and seems to dematerialise in the warm yellow orange glow. Drawings by both Le Gros and Juvarra demonstrate that each of them contributed to finding the right composition for the sculpture and tried a number of different poses.Gerhard Bissell, A \\"Dialogue\\" between Sculptor and Architect: the Statue of S. Filippo Neri in the Cappella Antamori, in: Stuart Currie, Peta Motture (ed.), The Sculpted Object 1400‚Äì1700, Aldershot 1997, pp. 221‚Äì237. Le Gros also made many putti and cherubim and two plaster reliefs for the ceiling showing scenes from Neri's life. The exquisitely crafted chapel is one of the very few traces of Juvarra's activities in Rome. With the vast, lavish Monument to Pope Gregory XV and cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi in Sant'Ignazio, Le Gros conceived his last work for the Jesuits between about 1709‚Äì14. It singularly combines the tombs of both the pope and his cardinal- nephew and celebrates their merits from a pronounced Jesuit point of view as the inscription explains: ALTER IGNATIUM ARIS. ALTER ARAS IGNATIO (one raised Ignatius to the altars, the other erected altars for Ignatius). This alludes to the facts that Gregory canonised the saint and Ludovico built the church of Sant'Ignazio. The concept is highly theatrical with a large curtain (made from coloured marble) being drawn back by two Famae (both the work of Pierre- √âtienne Monnot from designs by Le Gros) to reveal the protagonist. This curtain obscures the wall behind and creates the illusion that the monument has the rare quality of being free standing rather than attached to the wall as is the norm. The composition also makes use of the monument's location in the only chapel with a side entrance to the church (to the right of the monument) by turning several figures directly towards visitors entering from there and inviting them in ‚Äì an effect which today is hard to appreciate as the door is no longer in use. From 1711‚Äì14 followed the Cappella di S. Francesco di Paola in San Giacomo degli Incurabili, for which Le Gros was the architect ‚Äì which basically means he was in charge of all its decoration ‚Äì and the sculptor of a large relief showing the saint in adoration of an old venerated image of the Madonna and child, intervening to cure the sick. Decline In 1713, he managed to alienate the Jesuits by stubbornly repeating his proposal to transfer his own statue of Stanislas Kostka on his Deathbed into the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale as a centrepiece for the newly decorated chapel of saint Stanislas.See also: Francis Haskell, Pierre Legros and a Statue of the Blessed Stanislas Kostka, in: Burlington Magazine, vol. 97, 1955, pp. 287‚Äì291. At the same time, all efforts of deciding who should be commissioned with the last Lateran apostle were at a stalemate with, it seems, three serious contenders: Le Gros, Angelo de' Rossi and Rusconi. The latter had already produced three apostles and was by then clearly favoured by Pope Clement XI, but no decision was made. In 1714, Le Gros' father died in Paris and he himself was close to death's door, suffering from gall stones. =Paris= In order to have an operation done and also to settle his inheritance, in 1715 he travelled to Paris, where he stayed with his great friend Pierre Crozat who managed to arrange his travel on a royal ship. Very rich, but with humorous irony nicknamed Crozat le pauvre (Crozat the poor) because his brother Antoine was even wealthier, he was a renowned collector and patron of the arts. His house was at the centre of artistic life for connoisseurs and established as well as up and coming artists. There, Le Gros would certainly have met the ageing Charles de la Fosse who lived with Crozat but also his young prot√©g√© Antoine Watteau. In addition Le Gros renewed his friendships with Oppenordt and Vleughels. Crozat had Le Gros decorate a cabinet in his Parisian house and the chapel in his magnificent country retreat, the Ch√¢teau de Montmorency (both destroyed). Both Crozat and Oppenordt were on good terms with the Regent, so Le Gros would have had a good start had he decided to stay in Paris. He also acted as a go-between in Crozat's long negotiations (1714‚Äì21) to acquire the art collection of Queen Christina of Sweden for the regent. But he had great trouble with the art establishment, and the Acad√©mie royale would not admit him easily into their ranks despite his status as an internationally acclaimed artist. Rebuffed, Le Gros returned to Rome in 1716. =Rome= Back in Rome, the last sad chapter of his life unfolded. His absence had been a great excuse to give the last Lateran apostle to Rusconi. The reason given was that de' Rossi was dead, Le Gros abroad, and therefore Rusconi the only good sculptor available. It was, however, of far greater consequence what happened at the Accademia di San Luca. Lead by Marco Benefial and Michelangelo Cerruti (both non-academicians), a protest arose in 1716 against newly introduced rules of the academy which subjected non-members to financial injustice. Francesco Trevisani and three other academicians (Pasquale de' Rossi, Giovanni Maria Morandi and Bonaventura Lamberti) distanced themselves from subscribing to these new rules, and Le Gros sided with them on his return. As a result, all five were unceremoniously expelled. This meant that they were then unable to carry out any more public commissions in Rome in their own right. The rich Roman art market was effectively closed to Le Gros, and he had to settle for a few works outside. After being first approached by the Benedictine abbey of Montecassino in 1712, in 1714 he gave in and took on three statues for the abbey's Chiostro dei Benefattori at a bargain price. These now became his main focus. At the time of his death, the statue of Pope Gregory the Great was finished and Emperor Henry II only needed finishing touches. The third, Charlemagne, was hardly started and subsequently taken on by Le Gros' loyal assistant Paolo Campi as his own work. During the heavy bombing of Montecassino in World War II, Pope Gregory was nearly completely destroyed and is now heavily restored while Henry II suffered less damage and remains recognisable as a work by Le Gros. Without doubt due to the intervention of Juvarra, who was by then architect to the Duke of Savoy, Le Gros created two female saints for Juvarra's facade of the church of S. Cristina in Turin (c. 1717‚Äì18). Upon their arrival, the statues of Saint Christina and Teresa of Avila were considered too beautiful to be exposed to the elements and brought into the church's interior (1804 transferred to Turin Cathedral) and to be replaced on the facade by copies by a local sculptor. This flattery was probably intended to be a reminder of a similar honour which was bestowed on Bernini half a century earlier with regards to his two angels for Ponte Sant'Angelo. In a letter from 6 January 1719 to Rosalba Carriera, hoping to introduce the two on her planned visit to Rome, Crozat described Le Gros as \\"without question the best sculptor there is in Europe, and the most honest man and the most endearing there is.\\"Le Gros \\"sans contredit, est le meilleur sculpteur qu‚Äôil y ait en Europe, et le plus honn√™te homme et le plus aimable qu‚Äôil y ait\\", as quoted by Vittorio Malamanni, Rosalba Carriera, in: Le Gallerie Italiane 4:1896‚Äì97, p. 51. While Le Gros' great achievement was appreciated elsewhere, he would wait in vain for a similar adulation in Rome. Rusconi received a knighthood from Clement XI for his contribution to the Lateran project in late 1718 while Le Gros went empty handed. Pierre Le Gros died from pneumonia half a year later on 3 May 1719 and was buried in the French national church in Rome. If we believe Pierre-Jean Mariette, disappointment advanced his early death: > \\"If he was indisposed against the Parisian academy, he was even more piqued > by the honours conferred on Camillo Rusconi for the figures this able > sculptor has made for Saint John Lateran. He expected to at least share them > with him, and that would have been right; ... one more miserable cross might > have preserved him for us, because one suspects that the chagrin has > advanced his days.\\"\\"S‚Äôil fut indispos√© contre l‚ÄôAcad√©mie de Paris, il √©toit > encore plus piqu√© des honneurs qu‚Äôavoient procur√©s √† Camille Ruscone les > figures que cet habile sculpteur avoit faites pour Saint-Jean de Latran. Il > s‚Äôattendoit √† les partager du moins avec lui, et cela √©toit juste; ... Une > mis√©rable croix de plus nous l‚Äôauroit peut-√™tre conserv√©, car on soup√ßonne > que le chagrin avoit avanc√© ses jours.\\" Pierre-Jean Mariette, \\"Abecedario\\", > vol. III, edited by Philippe de Chennevi√®res and Anatole de Montaiglon, in: > Archives de l‚ÄôArt Fran√ßais 6, 1854‚Äì56, p. 120. Only in 1725, with the painter Giuseppe Chiari being its principe, were the five dissenters rehabilitated and reinstated as members of the Accademia di San Luca, four of them posthumously as only Trevisani was still alive at the time. Importance Cappella Antamori with San Filippo Neri in Gloria, 1708‚Äì1710, San Girolamo della Carit√†, Rome Today, Le Gros is largely forgotten but shares this fate with almost all the artists working in Rome in his time. After a blanket condemnation of the Baroque period by critics from the 18th to well into the 20th century, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and a few other 17th century artists have now been given their rightful place in the pantheon of artistic geniuses. But even the great Alessandro Algardi, while certainly given his dues by art historians,First and foremost Jennifer Montagu, Alessandro Algardi, New Haven (Yale University Press) 1985. is not anchored in the public consciousness,See Montagu's remarks in her interview with Jo√£o R. Figueiredo in Forma de vida. much less so the following generations of Maratti or Fontana, and then Le Gros and Rusconi. During their lifetime however, they were regarded throughout Europe as outstanding figures, valued as exemplary by generations of young artists. An impartial look shows Le Gros as a driving force in an international environment. While family life was very French, close friends included painters such as the Dutch Gaspar van Wittel, the Frenchmen Vleughels and Louis de Silvestre as well as the Italian Sebastiano Conca, architects such as the Italian Juvarra and the Frenchman Oppenordt, and the sculptors Angelo de' Rossi as well his loyal students and right hand men Campi and Gaetano Pace. In addition, the need for assistants brought a bevy of young sculptors and painters from all over Europe to his studio over the years like the Englishman Francis Bird and the Frenchman Guillaume Coustou who frequented his workshop before 1700, both eventually becoming significant artists in their home countries. In the 1710s we find in his workshop the German painter Franz Georg Hermann and the still very young Carle van Loo who studied drawing with Le Gros. In addition to passing on his style through students, copies and versions of important statues such as his St. Dominic, St. Ignatius or the Apostle Bartholomew can be found all over Europe and engravings were disseminated of his Luigi Gonzaga and Stanislas Kostka. Le Gros' influence didn't end with his death as his works were also studied much later as evidenced in sketches by Edme Bouchardon. Even in the second half of the 18th century connoisseurs in Paris described his Vetturie as an exemplary masterpiece, the quality of which far exceeds the ancient model. The importance of Le Gros for European art in the 18th century is, therefore, beyond question. That said, because of his nearly exclusive presence in Rome, he must be seen within the context of Italian art history and made virtually no direct impact on the development of French art of his own time.Michael Levey, Painting and Sculpture in France 1700‚Äì1789, (Yale University Press) 1993, p. 82 (originally published as part of the Pelican History of Art: Wend Graf von Kalnein and Michael Levey, Art and Architecture of the Eighteenth Century in France, Harmondsworth 1972 and several new editions). His French contemporaries would have heard about him but wouldn't have seen his works. His Vetturie, a student work, arrived in France 20 years overdue and the Bouillon Monument was not even unpacked until the end of the 18th century and, therefore, not known to anybody. Moreover, the exuberance of Le Gros' work would have met with reserve or even disapproval in Versailles just as Bernini's did in the 1660s. At the same time, it is impossible to characterise his art as purely Italian. His artistic training at the Acad√©mie royale and the experience in the workshops of his father and uncles gave him a very different starting point. He built on this experience and mixed it with an admiration for Bernini's high baroque. His love for fine detail is something he shared with older French sculptors like Fran√ßois Girardon and Antoine Coysevox. Imbued with the French academic practice of searching for exemplary prototypes, Le Gros looked very closely at all the art around him and found solutions by today less well known sculptors like Melchiorre Caf√† and Domenico Guidi but also painters like Giovanni Battista Gaulli helpful, and he adapted them for his own work, often transformed to such a degree that the prototype is hard to pinpoint. There were only very few artists who worked successfully in a similarly playful style as Le Gros in early 18th century Rome, namely Angelo de' Rossi, Bernardino Cametti and Agostino Cornacchini. But the mood of the time drifted more and more towards classicism and made them a dying breed. =Style= Medallion of Ludovico Ludovisi, c. 1709‚Äì1713, detail of the Ludovisi Monument in Sant'Ignazio Accordinig to Gerhard Bissell, Le Gros was a sculptor of brilliant technical ability: > The most virtuoso marble worker of his time, he excelled in convincing the > eye to see the depicted materials rather than stone. His surfaces are so > nuanced they nearly appear as different colours. And yet, he achieved that > very rare feat of integrating these fine details into monumental sculptures > without appearing grotesque.Gerhard Bissell, On the Tercentenary of the > Death of Pierre Le Gros, Italian Art Society blog, 2 May 2019 He always tended to compose his sculptures like a relief. For his picturesque approach, an expansive shape mattered more to him than the distribution of mass and space. While the detail as well as the large form are very three- dimensional, their volume is usually tied into a system of layers. This leads by no means to a single point of view. Quite the contrary because Le Gros developed all his composition into space and entices the viewer to go around the figure. While a classicist like Rusconi linked a spatial development closely to the anatomy of the figure, Le Gros achieved this with an abundance of highly malleable drapery and extrovert gestures. In addition, he showed a keen sense for nuanced effects of light and shadow, whether it was to make the heavily polished, white as snow figure of Luigi Gonzaga stand out, or to cast Filippo Neri into a mystical shade. All of Le Gros' work is characterised by a dynamic of far and near view. It is worth getting close up to even his most heroic-scale figures.

In the 1970s and early 1980s it was one of the most popular local bands in the state.Metro Magazine, July 2000 - Legendary Rockers Unite Arrogance made a run of appearances at Raleigh's Village Subway, and was the first group to play some chords at the Pier back in 1973.Candid Slice, April 2015 - Arrogance: Remembering The Village Subway Music Scene The group has released six full length albums in its history and an early non-LP single. In 1983 the group entered a dormant period and the members did not perform together again until 2000, when the band reunited for a few select concerts and gigs in the Triangle area in celebration of Arrogance's 30th anniversary. The most notable was the \\"Reunion\\" concert at the North Carolina Museum of Art Amphitheatre in Raleigh in 2000. After large turnouts at the band's 2000 performances, Arrogance began performing again in local clubs, bars, and at special events, averaging about one show a year. The band's current lineup consists of Rod Abernethy, Don Dixon, Scott Davison, Robert Kirkland, and Marty Stout. History Arrogance began in a dorm room at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when Don Dixon and Robert Kirkland began singing together in 1969.Arrogance Biographies The band's success has inspired numerous other North Carolinian bands to emerge in search of national fame.Gaff Music - Arrogance arrogance ‚Äúone of the architects of the alternative trend of the 1980s‚Äù. . All Music Guide Robert Kirkland and Don Dixon started singing and making music together in an Aycock dorm room at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in the fall of 1969. It sounded pretty good so, along with Robert's roommate, Mike Greer, and a drummer from East Carolina University, Jimmy Glasgow, they formed a band and began playing. The first sets included an interesting mix of covers from artists like The Beatles, Black Sabbath, Muddy Waters, Cream and Mountain. They dubbed the group Arrogance, a concept of Dixon's referring to their reputation of upstaging other bands. A few months later at Crescent City Studios in Greensboro, the band made its first recording‚Äîa 45-rpm single of two original tunes, ‚ÄúBlack Death‚Äù and ‚ÄúAn Estimation‚Äù, that was released in the summer. This rare recording has since become a collector's item. As the artistic partnership between Dixon and Kirkland strengthened, the band personnel changed, with Mike and Jimmy leaving and being replaced by pianist Marty Stout and percussionist Ogie Shaw; with this change the music became more acoustic. Arrogance's debut album, the self-released, self-produced LP Give Us a Break , came out in 1973. A more acoustic folk style had, by then, replaced the early hard-rock, but the trademark vocals, harmonies and smart lyrics were very much in evidence. The sound became more upbeat when percussionist Ogie Shaw was replaced by drummer Steve Herbert and the result was Arrogance's second self-labeled LP, Prolepsis, coming out in 1975. The band's wry wit and perspective shows in the record's title, meaning preparation for anticipated things to come, and the music reflected a new level of talent and professionalism, not only in the songs, which were an amalgamation of rock, country and folk, but in the outstanding arrangements and production values of the recording. Late in 1974, before the release of Prolepsis, Steve Herbert left the band and was replaced by Steve Ball Band drummer, Scott Davison. By now Arrogance was amassing a substantial following of dedicated fans and headlining at regional clubs like Town Hall, The Pier and The Cat's Cradle even though they insisted on playing original music ... unheard of by audiences in those days and unfathomable to club owners, but Arrogance was good enough to make it work. As one fan said, \\"They could knock you down, not with volume but with sheer intelligence and taste and, really, a sense of history.\\" Arrogance's strategy of building a regional following and releasing their own music was not only unparalleled, it was radical, but it finally brought them national attention by the end of 1975 when the band signed with Vanguard Records. Rumors was released in 1976 but unfortunately Vanguard, then a New York City independent label, was ill- equipped to properly support and promote an up-and-coming rock band since its roster was primarily folk artists. And it probably didn't help that, early the following year, Fleetwood Mac released a multi-platinum album using the English spelling of the same title, ‚ÄúRumours.‚Äù But for whatever reasons, Rumors‚Äô launch was less than successful. Arrogance parted from Vanguard after the one release. By this time folk rock was waning in popularity, so the band changed its focus back to its roots in rock and roll. Rod Abernethy, the final member of Arrogance, joined on lead guitar in 1976. \\"We needed something to help spice us up a bit,\\" said Scott. And that Rod certainly did, bringing an electric British pop influence to the music. The addition of Rod pushed the band to its live-performance peak. As Dixon and Robert matured as songwriters, the band's distinctive sound flourished. The harmonies were tight and sophisticated, the music energetic, original and masterfully arranged. Marty had developed an inimitable, indefinable style - an amalgamation of classical and early rock & roll piano with just the right amount of jazz mixed in - that contributed significantly to the band's unique sound. Consistent, steady and always interesting, Scott held the beat, drove the band and kept the rock n‚Äô roll alive, while doubling as Arrogance's comedian and class clown. Arrogance had become a truly great live band and the fans were numerous and loyal. Playing to huge crowds, Arrogance was the most popular band in the region. Describing those days Robert said, \\"We were enjoying big crowds at that time and it was quite thrilling to be the center of attention. Onstage we still kept it interesting because we never wore anything out by rehearsing it to death.\\" And Dixon agreed, \\"In the late '70s, we were cranking,\\" adds Dixon. \\"I was likely to climb up on my amp and scream 'til I passed out.\\" In 1980, Arrogance signed a label agreement with Warner Brothers new Curb Records division and were off to California to record Suddenly. Again the band's tongue-in-cheek humor shows itself in an album title, since it was far from suddenly that Arrogance was appearing on the national scene. Although this seemed like the long-awaited break, once again the timing was bad. Although the LP was an excellent pop-rock recording with more than one potential single, the label's attention had turned to post-punk power pop and Arrogance was pushed down on their list of priorities (along with the B-52s and the Talking Heads). Arrogance returned to playing for live audiences when the Warner/Curb relationship failed and recorded a live album documenting their tour on the independent label Moonlight Records in 1981 and entitled it Lively. Included was an EP from the band's alter ego, Dogbreath, containing an eclectic array of upbeat covers from ‚ÄúWipe Out‚Äù to ‚ÄúWooly Bully.‚Äù In 1982, still trying to find the proper label for their music, the band recorded a stunning mix of twelve new wave-flavored rock and bouncy, soulful pop songs. They distributed the demo under the name of 5‚Äô11‚Äù (the average of the combined heights of all the members) hoping the name change might improve their luck, but to no avail. In October 1983, the group played its last gigs in the North Carolina Triangle area and disbanded. But that was not the end of Arrogance. In spring of 2000 Dixon, now a well respected producer, engineer, songwriter and performer, decided to re-release the Arrogance recordings on CD for the group's 30th Anniversary. Two Reunion Shows were planned, one May 20 for the group to play its folk-rock repertoire at the Carrboro, N.C., Arts Center, and one June 10 featuring their electric music. Arrogance, N.C.‚Äôs greatest rock n‚Äô roll band, took the stage at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh and played to a packed house. And they didn't stop there. In August 2002, then Charlotte-based GAFF Music released the long overdue 1982 recordings and a compilation of other previously unreleased Arrogance tunes (including Dixon's pop anthem ‚ÄúPraying Mantis‚Äù) as The 5‚Äô11‚Äù Record to critical acclaim. ‚ÄúAfter 20 years have passed, it may amaze the first-time listener that they didn't succeed, since the songwriting quality is so good, with catchy melodies and clever lyrics, the playing is sterling . . . an excellent overview of an unjustly forgotten regional band that deserved better,‚Äù wrote William Ruhlmann of \\"All Music Guide\\". Or as entertainment critic Godfrey Cheshire, a long time fan and friend of the band said, \\"Everybody that gets out there and plays original songs at the Cat's Cradle and puts out their own records is following in Arrogance's footsteps in North Carolina.\\" On May 13, 2017, the band performed a show at Kings in Raleigh.

During World War I, he served as a correspondent on the Serbian front and his imagery became more dramatic but, after another visit to Paris, he returned to his Impressionist tendencies. From 1920 until his retirement in 1932, he served as a professor at his alma mater, the University of Fine Arts. In 1924, he was one of the founders of the \\"\\" (New Society of Artists, whose acronym \\"K√öT\\" means \\"fountain\\" in Hungarian). In 1926, he was commissioned to paint murals at the Biological Institute in Tihany. When he retired, he had already been suffering from heart disease for several years so, as it worsened, he made plans to settle permanently in the rural village of Tata, where he owned a villa and had spent many summers painting. These plans were thwarted by his sudden death, in Budapest, but Tata still became his final resting place. A street and an elementary school there are named after him.

History The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and Built Environment, a long-established part of the Robert Gordon University, has provided professionally accredited surveying courses since 1918. It was formed by the merging of the School of Construction, Property and Surveying and the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture. The School takes its name from Tom Scott Sutherland, an Aberdeen Architect and Entrepreneur, who gifted the School's Victorian Mansion house and grounds overlooking the River Dee in 1956, as well as making a generous bequest which is used to help finance study tours and visiting lecturers. More detailed information is available at the main Robert Gordon University article. The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and the Built Environment celebrated its 50th anniversary on the Garthdee site. Campus The RGU campus is located in a parkland setting on the north bank of the River Dee, in the south-west suburbs of Aberdeen, with a number of campus buildings designed by prominent architectural firms such as BDP (Sir Ian Wood building, formerly known as Riverside East) and Norman Foster's Foster + Partners (Business School building). The School is based in the Scott Sutherland Building, which is a modern building constructed in phases between the 1950s and early 1970s. The School also uses part of the 19th century Garthdee House (as originally donated by Tom Scott Sutherland), which is physically connected to the Scott Sutherland Building. However, new accommodation for the School is due to open in September 2015 as an extension to the university's Sir Ian Wood building. The School has a close relationship with the adjacent Gray‚Äôs School of Art where students are encouraged to use the extensive workshop facilities. The Scott Sutherland School has a student- led lecture series which has run since 1988 and is called 5710, after the latitude of Aberdeen. New Buildings BDP is to design the campus for the Robert Gordon University and six of its buildings, including a new building to house the School of Architecture. The university‚Äôs director of estates Mike Berry said that while it was unusual for one architect to design all the buildings within a masterplan, this approach would help to avoid \\"the mad eclecticism\\" associated with new campuses designed by several architects. He said: \\"We‚Äôre a long way from unpacking this ‚Äî it‚Äôs a 10 year vision. We want to create a sustainable campus in the fullest sense and we‚Äôve appointed an organisation with the resources to do that.\\" BDP landed the commission to design the ¬£115 million Garthdee campus, west of the city centre, beating competition from Foster & Partners, RMJM, Edward Cullinan Architects, Capita Architecture, Pascall+Watson, Richard Murphy Architects and Sheppard Robson. The practice‚Äôs Glasgow office will oversee the university‚Äôs move to the campus ‚Äî a project that involves working up an earlier masterplan by RMJM. John McManus, a director at BDP Glasgow, said: \\"Designing a new building for the schools is a dream project. Many of my colleagues are graduates of the school that they will help to redesign.\\" Associate Head of School, Dr Bassam Bjeirmi, also welcomed BDP‚Äôs appointment to design a new building for his department, adding: \\"We‚Äôll use the design and building process as a teaching aid for our students. It‚Äôs going to be very useful from a research point of view.\\" Program The current head of School is Professor David McClean. The School offers a Master of Architecture (MArch) programme as a first degree in architecture, and BSc Honours degrees in Surveying, Architectural Technology and Construction Design and Management. Postgraduate courses include the Graduate Diploma in Surveying and MSc courses in Advanced Architectural Studies, Construction Project Management, Property Development and Visualisation in Architecture and the Built Environment. The School undertakes world leading research, including a PhD programme. Research at the School includes work concerning sustainable design, visualisation, collaborative and participatory design, pedagogy and project management. Staff from be school regularly contribute to leading academic journals and conferences, and much of the research activity is undertaken in association with public and private sector partners from across Europe. In the UK Research Excellence Framework 2014, over 60% of research in the School was judged to be at World Leading and International level. As the most northerly school of architecture in the UK, the School works closely with the North East of Scotland community but maintains links with both the rest of the UK and Europe. The student lecture society, appropriately named 57 10 (after the latitude of Aberdeen), hosts many luminaries from the architecture profession.

History On November 30, 1863, the United States Department of War authorized Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton to raise one regiment of infantry composed of African Americans. On December 3, the state's adjutant general issued orders to begin accepting enlistments, which began December 24. On January 12, 1864, the War Department notified Morton that the regiment would be called the \\"28th Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops.\\" Reverend Willis Revels and Garland H. White, both ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Indianapolis, Indiana was the chief recruiting officer. Recruits trained until the end of March at a camp established on land owned by Calvin Fletcher, a prominent citizen. The camp was named \\"Camp Fremont\\" in honor of John C. Fr√©mont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee and Union army general. Placed in charge of the newly formed unit was Charles Sawyer Russell, a captain of the 11th U.S. Infantry Regiment who was (on 1 May 1864) appointed Lieutenant Colonel and battalion commander of the six organized companies. On April 25, the six companies of the 28th left Indianapolis for Washington, D.C., where they were attached to the capital's defenses. The 28th sustained heavy casualties in the Battle of the Crater at the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia, on July 30, 1864, when nearly half of its soldiers were killed or wounded. William Fox (see references) put the 28th's losses at 11 killed, 64 wounded and 13 missing, a total of 88. Following the Battle of the Crater, the depleted ranks of the 28th were filled with four more companies of recruits raised in Indiana and sent to make the command a full regiment. The commander, Lieutenant Colonel Russell, was reappointed as the regimental commander with the rank of Colonel on 23 August 1864. Russell was also brevetted Brigadier General on 30 July 1864 in recognition of the 28th's performance at The Crater. After the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, the 28th was moved to the Mexican border in Texas as part of the American response to the French intervention in Mexico. The 28th was formally mustered out in Corpus Christi, Texas on November 8, 1865.\\"The Union Army\\" by Federal Publishing Company, 1908 - Volume 3 It returned to Indianapolis January 6, 1866, to a reception in its honor. According to Frederick H. Dyer (see references), the regiment suffered a total of 212 fatalities: two officers and 45 enlistees killed and mortally wounded in combat and one officer and 164 enlistees who died of disease.

Founded March 28, 1995, the station is owned by Azteca Broadcasting Corporation, a company unrelated to the Azteca Stations Group or Azteca International Corporation, the parent company of Azteca America. Unlike many low-powered stations, it is seen on Channel 98 through Comcast cable in the Salt Lake City area in addition to its low powered signal.  History  Older station logo. The station began with an original construction permit issued to Rolando Collantes on March 28, 1995 to build a low-power station on UHF channel 21 to serve the Ogden, Utah, area. Station K21ET was licensed on March 1, 1996, with programming mostly from the Univision network. A month later, the station took the call letters KSVN-LP; Collantes also owned KSVN radio (730 AM). In 1999, Collantes formed a new company, Azteca Broadcasting Corporation, and moved the station's license under the new entity. In September 2000, facing displacement from channel 21, the station moved to channel 49 and in December 2000, upgraded to a Class A license. They changed their call letters to KSVN-CA a month later. In July 2002, the station dropped Univision and joined Azteca America. On October 16, 1995, Collantes was issued a construction permit to build a low-power translator station on UHF channel 66 to serve Salt Lake City. The station, given callsign K66FN, was also licensed on March 1, 1996. Like KSVN-CA, K66FN served as a Univision affiliate until switching to Azteca America in 2002. In July 2006, the station applied for permission to move to UHF channel 39. As of January 19, 2010, K66FN is off air on channel 66 and has begun broadcasting digitally on channel 39. Digital television June 12, 2009, was the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations in the United States, and does not apply to low power stations. Therefore, KSVN-CD had been able to convert to digital broadcasts on their own schedule. K66FN, which served the Salt Lake City area, has been replaced by a digital signal, K39JS-D channel 39.1.

Biography Although born in Devizes (Wiltshire, England), Harris never lived there, being raised and schooled in the Wiltshire village of Pewsey. He left Pewsey Vale School at 15, and tried several dead end jobs before beginning an apprenticeship as an electronics engineer in 1984. At the age of seventeen, Harris was recruited by New Model Army to replace original bass player Stuart Morrow (1980‚Äì85) who had left the band midway through the 1985 'No Rest For The Wicked' tour. He toured extensively with the band over the next five years, playing at venues across Europe, the United States and Japan. He also contributed to New Model Army's milestone albums, The Ghost of Cain (1986) and Thunder and Consolation (1989), before leaving in 1990, when he was replaced by Peter \\"Nelson\\" Nice. In late 1992 he joined punk/goth rock band, The Damned. Having recorded the Not of This Earth album with them during 1994, he left in mid-1995 following the dissolution of that line-up. When the band reformed in 1996, he was replaced by former The Damned and Eddie and the Hot Rods bassist, Paul Gray. After The Damned split in 1995, Moose moved away from music as a professional career, but still maintained a relationship with the business through music tuition, session work and music production. Although Dave Vanian offered Moose a chance to return to The Damned in 1996, the promised tour never materialised, and Vanian's future wife Patricia Morrison took over as bass guitarist soon after. Between 1996 and 2007, Harris was the bass guitarist for Pants with former Lurkers drummer, Dan Tozer, guitarist Fal and a succession of singers including Sean Wratten, Ivor Richards and Ian Oliver. When Pants split, Harris and Oliver collaborated on the self-described \\"retro-futurist synth rock\\" duo The Pieshop Boys, appearing sporadically between 2008 and 2013. Pants reformed in 2014 and still perform occasionally. Since 2000 he has contributed to a number of diverse projects, including live and studio work with folk-rock group Pig Country, nine-piece ska band Ska Trouble, and punk band Bastard Squad. He also assisted with the restoration of the hitherto unreleased album by Raspberry Parade, a psychedelic work masterminded by Steve Marshall, using the long lost recordings of Brian Heddon. In 2005, he became one-third of the band Sleeper Cell, an unusual full-band project for singer/songwriter and acoustic guitarist Nick Harper. Sleeper Cell also featured Dan Tozer on drums. The band toured briefly in the Autumn of 2005, including an appearance at the Beautiful Days Festival. In 2011, director Matt Reid interviewed Moose at his home for a documentary about New Model Army. The finished film, Between Dog and Wolf: the New Model Army Story premi√®red in London on 5 October 2014, at Piccadilly Vue, as part of the Raindance Film Festival 2014.

War Resisters' International (WRI), headquartered in London, is an international anti-war organisation with members and affiliates in over 30 countries. History War Resisters' International was founded in Bilthoven, Netherlands in 1921 under the name \\"Paco\\", which means \\"peace\\" in Esperanto. WRI adopted a founding declaration that has remained unchanged: It adopted the broken rifle as its symbol in 1931. Many of its founders had been involved in the resistance to the First World War: its first Secretary, Herbert Runham Brown, had spent two and a half years in a British prison as a conscientious objector. Two years later, in 1923, Tracy Dickinson Mygatt, Frances M. Witherspoon, Jessie Wallace Hughan, and John Haynes Holmes founded the War Resisters League in the United States. Notable members include Dutch anarchist Bart de Ligt, Quaker Richard Gregg and Tolstoyan Valentin Bulgakov. The group had a close working relationships with sections of the Gandhian movement. In January 1948, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi attended a preparatory meeting for the World Pacifist Meeting he called, at the behest of WRI, and which eventually took place in December 1949. It took the form of 50 international pacifists meeting with 25 of Gandhi's close associates in an \\"unhurried conference\\" in Santiniketan, West Bengal.Prasad, Devi: War is a Crime against Humanity: The story of War Resisters' International, pp. 272‚Äì276.

The warden of the home, Professor Jos√© Brocca is standing third from left in the photograph. In the 1930s and 1940s, WRI helped to rescue people from persecution under Francisco Franco and under the Nazis and found them safe homes with WRI members in other countries.Brock, Peter and Socknat, Thomas Paul, Challenge to Mars: Essays on Pacifism from 1918 to 1945. p.173. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1999. One of the leaders of the Norwegian branch of WRI (FmK), Olaf Kullmann, was arrested by the German Occupiers for his pacifist agitation; he was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he died in 1942.Brock and Socknat, p. 402-3. During the Cold War, WRI consistently sought out war resisters in the Soviet bloc: first individuals, and later groups. After the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, WRI organised protest demonstrations in four Warsaw Pact capitals. Fink, Carole, Gassert, Philipp, and Junker, Detlef. 1968: The World Transformed, p.449. Cambridge University Press, 1998. Daniel Ellsberg's attendance at a talk by Randy Kehler (as Kehler was preparing to submit to his sentence for draft resistance) at the WRI's 13th Triennial Meeting, held at Haverford College in August 1969, was a pivotal event in Ellsberg's decision to copy and release the Pentagon Papers. (It was Ellsberg's release of the Pentagon Papers which led President Nixon to create a group of in-house spies, who undertook the ill-fated Watergate break- in, which led to Nixon's resignation).The Most Dangerous Man in America In 1971, when Pakistani troops were blockading what was then East Pakistan, WRI launched Operation Omega to Bangladesh. More recently, the International Deserters Network associated with WRI has offered support for people resisting the Gulf War of 1991 and, on a much larger scale, the wars in the Balkans, where it was also engaged with several other peace organisations in an experiment in international nonviolent intervention, the Balkan Peace Team. In 1988, a WRI advert was cited as one of the reasons for the seizure of an edition of the Weekly Mail in South Africa, after the banning of the local End Conscription Campaign. The WRI office in London has supported three programmes: work on conscientious objection, supporting nonviolent movements against war and countering youth militarisation. Organisation War Resisters' International is a network of member groups. An international conference takes place at least once every four years. The Chair has been elected at international conferences (Assembleys) or by postal vote in advance of the international conference.

He was 58.\\" The son of a farmer, he was born in the village of Beaunay in the northerly Seine Maritime d√©partement. He began riding horses at a young age and competed in show jumping and cross-country equestrianism. He began his professional racing career driving horses in harness racing then after serving as a flat racing apprentice, obtained his license as a trainer in 1964. Fran√ßois Boutin was the trainer for the stables of Jean-Luc Lagard√®re and for the Stavros Niarchos family. During his more than thirty-year career he was the leading money winner in France seven times (1976, 1978‚Äì81, 1983‚Äì84). Although victory eluded him in France's most prestigious horse race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Boutin won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains on six occasions and most every other important race in the country multiple times. Racing outside France Boutin's horse Sagaro was the first to win England's Ascot Gold Cup three years in a row. As well, Boutin-trained horses won the 1982 English 2,000 Guineas, the 1987 1,000 Guineas and the Matron Stakes in Ireland (Nureyev, ridden by stable jockey Philippe Paquet, finished first in the 1980 Two Thousand Guineas, but was later disqualified). Fran√ßois Boutin trained April Run for Diana M. Firestone who won in France plus had back-to-back wins in the 1981-82 Grade I Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational at Belmont Park. Boutin is best remembered in the United States as the trainer of the Hall of Fame filly Miesque who had back-to-back wins in the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1987 and 1988 and for Arazi, whose breathtaking victory in the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile was followed by his shocking upset in the 1992 Kentucky Derby. From his first marriage he had one son, Eric, and two daughters, Patricia and Nathalie. A widower, he remarried in 1989 to Princess Lucy Young Ruspoli, the daughter of William T.

It is named after the French mathematician Paul L√©vy and the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov; Prokhorov introduced it in 1956 as a generalization of the earlier L√©vy metric. Definition Let (M, d) be a metric space with its Borel sigma algebra \\\\mathcal{B} (M). Let \\\\mathcal{P} (M) denote the collection of all probability measures on the measurable space (M, \\\\mathcal{B} (M)). For a subset A \\\\subseteq M, define the Œµ-neighborhood of A by :A^{\\\\varepsilon} := \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in M ~|~ \\\\exists q \\\\in A, \\\\ d(p, q) < \\\\varepsilon \\\\\\\\} = \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\in A} B_{\\\\varepsilon} (p). where B_{\\\\varepsilon} (p) is the open ball of radius \\\\varepsilon centered at p. The L√©vy‚ÄìProkhorov metric \\\\pi : \\\\mathcal{P} (M)^{2} \\\\to [0, + \\\\infty) is defined by setting the distance between two probability measures \\\\mu and u to be :\\\\pi (\\\\mu, u) := \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\varepsilon > 0 ~|~ \\\\mu(A) \\\\leq u (A^{\\\\varepsilon}) + \\\\varepsilon \\\\ \\\\text{and} \\\\ u (A) \\\\leq \\\\mu (A^{\\\\varepsilon}) + \\\\varepsilon \\\\ \\\\text{for all} \\\\ A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}(M) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. For probability measures clearly \\\\pi (\\\\mu, u) \\\\le 1. Some authors omit one of the two inequalities or choose only open or closed A; either inequality implies the other, and (\\\\bar{A})^\\\\varepsilon = A^\\\\varepsilon, but restricting to open sets may change the metric so defined (if M is not Polish). Properties * If (M, d) is separable, convergence of measures in the L√©vy‚ÄìProkhorov metric is equivalent to weak convergence of measures. Thus, \\\\pi is a metrization of the topology of weak convergence on \\\\mathcal{P} (M). * The metric space \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{P} (M), \\\\pi \\\\right) is separable if and only if (M, d) is separable. * If \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{P} (M), \\\\pi \\\\right) is complete then (M, d) is complete. If all the measures in \\\\mathcal{P} (M) have separable support, then the converse implication also holds: if (M, d) is complete then \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{P} (M), \\\\pi \\\\right) is complete. In particular, this is the case if (M, d) is separable. * If (M, d) is separable and complete, a subset \\\\mathcal{K} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{P} (M) is relatively compact if and only if its \\\\pi-closure is \\\\pi-compact.

It is one of the world‚Äôs largest makers of allergy immunotherapy products (also known as ‚Äòallergy vaccines‚Äô) with 81% of its revenue coming from sales in Europe. History ALK-Abello dates back to 1923 when Denmark‚Äôs first allergen extracts were produced at the pharmacy of the Copenhagen University Hospital. The company was subsequently established as Allergologisk Laboratorium K√∏benhavn. The company has since focused on mapping the mechanisms of allergic impact on the immune system in order to develop new and improved allergy therapies. The research focuses on prevention, treatment, and management of allergies, especially hay fever and asthma. In 1925 Juan Abello Pascual founded Abello Pharmaceuticals in Spain. In 1978, ALK released the first standardized line of products for the treatment of allergies. In 1992 ALK and Abello merged. In the 1990s, ALK was the first company to launch sublingual immunotherapy drops (allergy immunotherapy administered as droplets under the tongue). In recent years, ALK‚Äôs research and development strategy has been focused on introducing a range of sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-tablets). The first, for grass pollen allergy, was launched in 2006, and was followed by SLIT-tablets for ragweed pollen allergy in 2014 and house dust mite allergy in 2016. The company is part-owned by the Lundbeck Foundation, however is also a publicly traded entity. Corporate information ALK‚Äôs stock is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen Stock Exchange. As of February 7, 2017, the current members of ALK‚Äôs board of directors are: Steen Riisgaard (chairman of the board, chairman of the remuneration committee and chairman of the nomination committee) Jacob Kastrup (employee elected) Lars Holmqvist (member of the remuneration committee) Andreas Slyngborg Holst (employee elected) Anders Gersel Pedersen (chairman of the scientific committee, member of the remuneration committee) Jakob Riis (chairman of the audit committee) Lene Skole (member of the audit committee and the nomination committee) Katja Barnkob Thalund (employee elected) Per Valstorp (member of the audit committee) As of February 7, 2017, the members of ALK‚Äôs board of management are: Carsten Hellmann (President and Chief Executive Officer) Henrik Jacobi (Executive Vice President, Research and Development) S√∏ren Niegel (Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations) Flemming Pedersen (Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President) Helle Skov, Executive Vice President, Product Supply Operations ALK employs 2,300 people worldwide. The company‚Äôs global headquarters and its main research and development center are on the Scion DTU science and technology park in H√∏rsholm, Denmark, in the Capital Region of Denmark. The company is present in 32 countries, either directly or via partnerships, and works with distributors in a number of other markets. Other ALK facilities include: *European production facilities in H√∏rsholm, Denmark, in Vendeuil and Varennes-en-Argonne, France, and in Madrid, Spain. *North American production facilities in Port Washington, New York, in Post Falls, Idaho, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and in Mississauga, Ontario. Products Allergy immunotherapy products account for 89% of ALK‚Äôs revenues and comprise three types of product: * Sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-tablets) covering grass pollen, ragweed pollen and house dust mite allergies. * Sublingual immunotherapy drops (SLIT-drops). A droplet-based allergy vaccine marketed under various brand names and covering approximately 40 different allergens and combinations of allergens, including pollens, molds, mites and pets. * Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). An injection-based allergy vaccine marketed under various brand names and covering the most common allergens such as pollens, molds, mites, pets, bees and wasps. The aforementioned allergy immunotherapy products are purified from natural allergen sources then combined with excipients during formulation. Other ALK products include an emergency adrenaline autoinjector for people who experience anaphylaxis, allergy diagnostic kits, for example, skin prick tests, and bulk allergen extracts, mostly sold in the US to allergy specialists for use in their practices. Partnerships and collaborations From 2006 until 2016, ALK had a strategic alliance with Merck & Co to develop and commercialize ALK‚Äôs SLIT- tablet products in the United States, Canada and Mexico, granting Merck exclusive rights to develop, market and distribute the tablets for grass pollen allergy, house dust mite allergy and ragweed allergy in those markets. In June 2016, ALK and Merck & Co announced that the partnership would end by the end of 2016. The company also has an alliance with Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd to develop and commercialize ALK‚Äôs house dust mite allergy immunotherapy products in Japan. The agreement covers the house dust mite SLIT-tablet, an injection-based immunotherapy product, and diagnostic products for house dust mite allergy. In addition, it established a research and development collaboration to develop a SLIT-tablet product for Japanese cedar pollen allergy. In China, ALK had a collaboration with Eddingpharm which covered ALK‚Äôs diagnostic skin prick test for house dust mite allergy, and a subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) product, also for house dust mite allergy. Under the agreement, Eddingpharm handled sales and distribution, while ALK provided medical and scientific expertise. Announced in April 2014, the collaboration was to run for an initial seven years, provided certain performance targets were met. However, the agreement was terminated by ALK in 2016 in favor of a collaboration with a new distributor. ALK also has a collaboration with Abbott covering Russia and selected emerging markets, under which Abbott gains rights to distribute and commercialize ALK's SLIT-tablets for grass, ragweed, tree and house dust mite allergies. The agreement with Abbott was expanded in 2016 allowing Abbott to register and sell ALK‚Äôs house dust mite SLIT-tablet in seven markets in South-East Asia: Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. ALK also signed a collaboration with bioCSL (now name Seqirus) covering Australia and New Zealand which grants it exclusive rights to promote and sell ALK‚Äôs SLIT-tablets against house dust mite and grass pollen allergy and its adrenaline auto-injector. Sponsorships ALK is one of the founder sponsors of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). It also sponsors and organizes an invitation-only biennial scientific symposium, the Symposium on Specific Allergy (SOSA). Since 2000, the company has sponsored the WAO Henning L√∏wenstein Research Award which is awarded to a young scientist who has shown excellence within the field of allergy. Since 2005, the award has been made every two years. The 2013 winner received ‚Ç¨10,000 (or an educational grant of corresponding value) and a travel grant to attend the 2013 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)/World Allergy Organization (WAO) Congress in Milan, Italy.

Scripts were by Marian Lines and Joy Whitby. The first interactive children's television programme. Using technology developed by Peter Schrek, children had a wand to indicate objects on the screen. Overview The programme was set in a scientific observatory inhabited by Giddy, a friendly alien who flew around on a magic pink pencil, setting simple games and puzzles. Redvers Kyle provided the voice for Giddy, although the little alien sounded very different from the familiar and distinctive sound of Kyle in his regular role as programme announcer for Yorkshire Television. The other characters that inhabited the observatory were a stupid but lovable gorilla called Gorilla (voiced by Bernard Bresslaw), and a professor called Gus (voiced by Richard Vernon). Games graphics were by John Sharp and Avram Buchanan.
