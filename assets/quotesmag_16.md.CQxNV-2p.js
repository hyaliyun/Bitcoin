Release Released as a single early in 1970, it was also included on the band's Looking On album later that year. With its aggressive guitar riff and growling vocal, the song marked a major shift in sound compared to their previous, more pop-orientated single \\"Curly\\", presumably Roy Wood's attempt to put some distance between the band and former vocalist Carl Wayne, whose \\"Middle of the road\\" leanings caused disagreements with the other members. This song was the first Move recording made after former Idle Race front man Jeff Lynne had joined, and he contributed guitar and piano. Lynne had been recruited into the group with the main aim of developing the embryonic Electric Light Orchestra, though they were contractually required to keep The Move (with their proven track record as a hit singles outfit) functioning in order to help finance the new project. This single (including its B-side, \\"Lightning Never Strikes Twice\\") was the only Move production after Lynne's addition that was credited solely to Wood; all subsequent releases (including the first ELO album) were credited to both Wood and Lynne. When The Move promoted it on Top of the Pops on BBC TV, Wood - who had never appeared on television as the group's frontman before - appeared in the makeup that he would later develop two years later as the leader of Wizzard. Cover versions *Tim Curry, of The Rocky Horror Picture Show fame, recorded a version of this in 1978 on his first solo album, Read My Lips. *Cheap Trick recorded a cover which was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of their 1997 self-titled album. It was also released as a B-side to the single \\"Baby No More\\". *The guitar solo from \\"Brontosaurus\\" was used in Cheap Trick's cover of another The Move song, \\"California Man\\", which appeared on their 1978 album Heaven Tonight. *The Supernaturals covered the song on their 1997 single The Day Before Yesterday's Man.

The song is notable in the history of the Contest; it was the first entry composed by Eurovision veteran Ralph Siegel, who would go on write 19 ESC entries throughout the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s - 14 for Germany including 1982 winner \\"Ein bi√üchen Frieden\\", 3 for Luxembourg, 1 for Switzerland, Montenegro in 2009, The Social Network Song for San Marino in 2012 and most recently \\"Crisalide (Vola)\\" for San Marino in 2013. \\"Bye, Bye, I Love You\\" is a mid-tempo ballad in which Sheer sings about ending a relationship with a man she appears to have met on a holiday. She sings that \\"I didn't really speak French\\" and that \\"you can't say a word in English\\", but despite the language barrier, the two were able to enjoy a happy relationship for some time. Her lover, however, was not entirely faithful - thus, regardless of her feelings, she ends the relationship. Sheer recorded the song in three languages, French, English and German - all with the title \\"Bye Bye I Love You\\". The song was performed ninth on the night (following Sweden's ABBA with \\"Waterloo\\" and preceding Monaco's Romuald with \\"Celui qui reste et celui qui s'en va\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 17. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1975 Contest by G√©raldine with \\"Toi\\".

(1976) p.2-3 Gospel magic does not claim to invoke spirits or paranormal powers. Gospel magic is intended to present the Christian good news through \\"visual parables\\"Thompson, AD (2001) p9; the trick or illusion is used to present theological points in an entertaining way with the intention that people will remember the message.Oswald, G and Anderson K. (2007) p. 3 Gospel magic is generally presented as stage magic or platform magic, but it can be adapted to close-up magic or micromagic situations.  History  The first modern use of Gospel magic is in the ministry of the Italian Catholic priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco (Don Bosco, 1815-1888). His autobiography lists many dozens of magic tricks used for the purpose of offering religious instruction to children and youth. Don Bosco has been seen as the Patron Saint of Catholic Magicians and, specifically, Catholic Gospel Magicians.Magicians Want Don Bosco Declared Their Patron, Zenit News Agency, 29. January 2002. In 1910, C. H. Woolston published Seeing Truth: Object Lessons with Magical and Mechanical Effects which aimed to help adults working with children in church. Other texts were soon written that incorporated Gospel messages with magic. In 1953, the International Fellowship of Christian Magicians began in the USA. This rapidly spread the use of the creative arts to teach the Gospel. Many Gospel Performers, dealers and authors made their first attempts at magic under their tuition. There are now chapters in many US and Canadian cities as well as in the UK, Germany and Hong Kong. An International magazine is published The Voice of the FCM every two months. Annual Conventions are held in USA, UK and Germany.http://www.fcm.org = In the Bible = The word \\"magic\\" never appears in the Bible. Daniel is called the \\"chief of the magicians\\" or \\"master of the magicians.\\" Daniel 4:9 The Bible condemns sorcery, astrology, speaking to spirits and witchcraft, but never does it condemn \\"magic.\\" = The arts and ministry = The arts have long been used to present Christian teachings. Icons, parables, music, song, dance, poetry, sculpture, painting, stained glass, theater, radio, film, television, the Internet, stage magic and illusion have all been used. Today this often includes story-telling, drama, puppetry, ventriloquism, balloon-modelling and juggling.

Some of these early hospitals were located in Baghdad and among those was the bimaristan Al-'Adudi. The hospital came to be when King of the Buyid Dynasty, 'Adud al-Dawla, decided to construct the hospital a few years before he died. Al-'Adudi was considered one of the most innovative and modern hospitals of the medieval Islamic time period. Amongst well-known physicians of the time period, this hospital was known as an institution for learning and practicing medicine.  Construction  King 'Adud al-Dawla provided the funding for the hospital from the properties that he owned. Before the construction of the building and its quarters, well-known physician, Al-Razi, was chosen to decide the ideal location for Al-'Adudi. In order to make the appropriate choice, it is said that different areas of the city were tested by hanging meat and choosing the place that resulted in the minimal amount of decay of the meat. The completion of the construction of Al-'Adudi was in 981 A.D. on the western banks of the Tigris River. The Al-'Adudi Hospital was reconstructed twice after its initial development. The first time the Al-'Adudi was destroyed occurred in 1068 due to a flood of the Tigris River. After it was rebuilt, it is said the hospital improved in its facilities and the care provided to patients. However, visitors who passed through the hospital shared that Al-'Adudi did not actually treat patients with the same quality care. Some shared that the physicians only visited patients a couple times a week. The Al-'Adudi Hospital was destroyed for the second time during the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. The hospital was not rebuilt for a third time. Medical institution Al-'Adudi served as more than a place in which infections were cured. The hospital was both a medical institution and an institution for learning medicine. As it was a Bimaristan, it served individuals of all backgrounds regardless of sex and other identities. Males and females were treated at the hospital by expert physicians of different areas of medicine that created set plans for patients. In Al-'Adudi, there were twenty-four physicians hired as well as nurses that cared for patients that shared the same sex. After the second construction of Al-'Adudi, the number of physicians increased to twenty-eight. Among the physicians, were specialists such as surgeons, ophthalmologists, orthopedics, oculists and future physicians. Some of the physicians cared for patients and also taught students of medicine. A traveler named, Ibn Jubayr, is said to have described the hospital to be made of many quarters that had large rooms for different purposes. Al-'Adudi was said to resemble characteristics of palaces. It also held some of the most recent pharmaceutical developments. Although the Al-'Adudi Hospital had its main location of function and work for physicians, Ibn Sina, who was a leader and well-known physician, asked that prisons also schedule organized regular medical checkups for the prisoners. He gave the physician, Sinan bin Thabit, the job to assign medical officers frequent visits to the prisons.  Learning institution  The way of learning for medical students today is similar when compared to the approach for learning medicine in early Islamic hospitals. Al-'Adudi was among the first hospitals that emphasized the importance for medical students to have direct contact with patients. Al-'Adudi began as one of the hospitals that would work as a place in which students could learn and practice their specialty. The education of medicine became significant during the period of hospitals like Al-'Adudi for the goal of having students move beyond the classroom. Al-'Adudi was modeled after hospitals like those in Jundi-Shapur. Medical students in Al-'Adudi were able to participate in rounds, attend lectures, and have discussions with other medical professionals. As there were physicians of different areas of expertise, students were, for example, able to view the skills of surgeons who practiced in optometry and orthopedics among other areas of medicine. One way in which the medical knowledge of students was assessed would be by directly asking students questions relating to the medical conditions of the patients in their presence. Among the physicians that taught and assessed students was Hibat Allah Ibn al-Tilmidh. Portrait of physician known as Rhazes (Al-Razi). He was involved in choosing the location of the 'Al-Adudi Hospital.  Physicians  There were numerous experts of medicine throughout the existence of Al-'Adudi that helped the hospital from the beginning of its founding until the end. Among those were Al-Razi, who helped King 'Adud al-Dawla choose the location of the hospital. Before the death of King 'Adud al-Dawla, Ibn Mandevaih worked under his reign for a salary. During Ibn Mandevaih's time at 'Al-Adudi, he was able to prove his medical knowledge, which allowed him to work further outside of the hospital. A physician who received his medical education at Al-'Adudi was Ibn Jazlah. He studied under Ibn Hibat Allah and continued his medical career by contributing to the field with works such as Taqwim al-Abdan fi Tadbir al-Insan (The Almanac of Bodily Parts for the Treatment of People). Ibn al-Tilmidh also contributed to Al-'Adudi during the early part of the 12th century in which he served as the chief of the hospital. Among the medical specialists that worked at Al-'Adudi were also Al-Dakhwar (optometrist), Ibn Tufail (surgeon), and Ibn Butlan, who received an education from the institution.

Background  The Nadew Command was one of four commands, or army corps, of the Ethiopian Second Revolutionary Army. Led by Colonel Getaneh Haile, it was composed of three infantry divisions and accompanying support units, and some sources state it had between 20,000 and 22,000 soldiers. Gebru Tareke, noting that the morale of the soldiers was at an all-time low, and none of the divisions \\"had even half of the numbers that would normally constitute an Ethiopian division ‚Äì ten to twelve thousand men\\", quotes Ministry of Defense reports to state that there were 15,223 men in the three divisions.Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009), p. 251. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) had attacked the Nadew Command a few months previously, with limited success. On 8 December 1987, the EPLF had attacked one of the divisions of the Command, the Twenty-second, with a force that may have contained as many as five infantry brigades, one mechanized battalion and three heavy-weapon battalions. On the second day of the assault, Eritrean infiltrators destroyed the divisional control center. It required the assistance of the Nineteenth Mountain Infantry Division and the 45th Infantry Brigade to halt further advances and repel the EPLF forces. Ethiopian losses in this preliminary engagement were 842 killed, 291 wounded and 615 missing; Eritrean losses have been estimated at 125 killed and 269 wounded. However, the Ethiopian side suffered even graver losses in the aftermath: on Mengistu Haile Mariam's order twenty senior officers were transferred and the commander of the Nadew Command, General Tariku Ayne, who had been absent from Afabet for medical treatment, was executed outside of Asmara on 15 February 1988. The death of one of Ethiopia's most prominent generals surprised even the EPLF, whose Radio of the Masses broadcast that the Derg had \\"cut off its right hand with its left hand\\". The Twenty-second Division was moved to Keren, and replaced with the Fourteenth Infantry Division. By mid-March 1988 the Nadew Command had planned to launch an offensive campaign against the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF); however, they were pre-empted by the EPLF.  Battle  On the morning of 17 March 1988, the EPLF deployed troops on three sides around Hedai Valley to encircle the Ethiopian garrison. The first unit attacked was the newly arrived Fourteenth Division. Upon their attack, the Ethiopian forces began to withdraw but were cut off. The battle continued while the Ethiopian garrison from Keren tried to reinforce their position, which was thwarted by the EPLF. A stumbling block for the EPLF was on the left flank, where their Eighty-fifth Division was held up by the dogged resistance of the Ethiopian Twenty-ninth Mechanized Brigade. It fought without reinforcement for most of a day until its commander gambled on a retreat to Afabet. Lacking time for careful reconnaissance before its withdrawal, the brigade was halted when a tank and truck were disabled by Eritrean 100mm guns, the burning vehicles blocking the road. The Ethiopians were forced to destroy their weaponry to prevent them from falling into EPLF hands.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopian Revolution, p. 254 Ethiopian aircraft even bombed their own troops. The commander of the Second Revolutionary Army came to the battlefield himself to supervise opening the road to Afabet \\"until he allegedly 'escaped on a camel' just before the fall of the garrison.\\"Gebru Tareke, Ethiopian Revolution, p. 256 Once the Ethiopian troops were routed in Hedai Valley, the EPLF stormed and captured Afabet. As the town was a major garrison the EPLF also captured a large cache of weapons in addition to those captured in the valley. Killion estimates that by the end of the three-day battle, the Eritreans had killed or captured over 18,000 Ethiopian soldiers. One Ethiopian to survive the battle was the commander of the Nadew Command, Colonel Getaneh Haile, who had fought his way to Keren with a single tank and four armored cars. The colonel thanked God for his escape; Gebru Tareke laconically comments that \\"the deities were not as kind to most of his men, who remained trapped in the town\\".  Aftermath  Not long after this defeat, Berhane Woldemichael wrote in the periodical Review of African Political Economy, : The significance to the Ethiopian regime of the loss of Afabet cannot be overstated. In this single battle, Ethiopia lost whole divisions of its best trained and armed troops. Worse still, it left behind a weapons stockpile that it had amassed to carry out what it believed was to have been 'a decisive offensive' against the EPLF. That 'decisive offensive' was being planned by Soviet military advisors. As it was, the EPLF, clearly outsmarting the Soviets, turned around the 'planned offensive' to their advantage. The Soviet Union had always denied direct involvement in Eritrea but was caught red- handed by the EPLF at Afabet by the capture of three Soviet military personnel, another one was killed in the combat.Berhane Woldemichael, \\"Ethiopian Military in Disarray,\\" Review of African Political Economy, No. 44, Ethiopia: 15 Years on (1989), p. 61 The victory over the Nadew Command is considered by the historian Basil Davidson to be the most significant victory for any liberation movement since the Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu. It has also been described as the largest battle in Africa since El Alamein. However, the Ethiopian historian Gebru Tareke disagrees with this comparison to Dien Bien Phu, pointing out that Davidson made his observation from the field as a guest of the EPLF, and that \\"the Ethiopian armed forces continued to fight, at times quite vigorously, for another three years.\\"Gebru Tareke, Ethiopian Revolution, p. 248 He concludes, \\"From a global perspective, Afabet was an event whereas Dien Bien Phu was eventful.\\"Gebru Tareke, Ethiopian Revolution, p. 260  References  Category:Battles of the Ethiopian Civil War Category:1988 in Eritrea Category:1988 in Ethiopia Category:Battles involving Ethiopia Category:Battles involving Cuba Category:Conflicts in 1988 Category:Eritrean War of Independence Category:March 1988 events in Africa Category:Ethiopia‚ÄìSoviet Union relations ","title":"Battle of Afabet"},{"id":"7718573","text":"\\"Toi\\" (English translation: \\"You\\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975, performed in French by Irish singer Geraldine.

It was established on 28 February 1965 in Failaka Island and was the only Kuwaiti club to have been established outside mainland Kuwait at that time. The club was relocated to mainland Kuwait after the 1990‚Äì1991 Gulf War, which resulted in the displacement of many inhabitants belonging to Failaka's island settlements. Therefore, due to inadequate facilities after the liberation of Kuwait, it was inevitable that the team had to move to a better and more sustainable location. Other reasons, aside the Gulf War, for the relocation of the club was due to the insufficient means of transportation for teams and players to travel to Failaka Island for away matches during the regular season. Al Yarmouk is mostly famous for its football team, which gave rise to a plethora of talented Kuwaiti football players during the course of its history. The club has only achieved 4 trophies since it was first established, 2 of which were the Prince Cups in 1970 and 1973, which is usually regarded as the most prestigious and important trophy in Kuwaiti football. The other 2 trophy achievements were the Second division titles won in 1968 and 1989. Al Yarmouk sports club went through a major renovation project since 2006, as part of a grand scheme to regenerate interest within the local Mishref community. A new stadium was built and is also planned for a second phase of renovation. Al Yarmouk also built new swimming facilities as well as an indoor arena for basketball, handball, volleyball and other indoor sports such as table tennis. A track and field team is also widely financed from the club's department. There is also an extra outdoor football field for training and for youth matches. The Mishref stadium is planned to be an all- seater, and there are also plans to make seating expansions and a roof around all the stands. The club's main two colors are navy blue and white, representing the sea, which was a major part of Failaka Island's culture. The logo represents the ancient Greek ruins located in Failaka Island, also known as 'Ikaros' during the times of Alexander the Great. Al Yarmouk club have since used this logo and color as a representation of their potential strength to success. The club isn't as popular as Kuwait's big five elite (Kuwait SC, Al-Arabi SC, Qadsia SC, Kazma SC and Salmiya SC), however, it is usually supported primarily by people in the surrounding area of the club's location. Prior to the Gulf War, it was supported by the local inhabitants of Failaka Island. After its relocation, however, it shifted away from Failaka's fanbase and is now attracting fans mostly from the Mishref residential area, although it also attracts supporters from other nearby areas such as Salwa and Bayan. People expect Al Yarmouk to have a bright and successful future with its ambitious new board.

The club was to represent the local inhabitants of Failaka. The club was officially declared on 28 February 1965 and was formally conceived by the Kuwaiti football association board on 7 March 1965. The name of the club roots back to the legendary Islamic battle of 'Al Yarmouk', which took place near the Yarmouk River, now the border between Jordan and Syria, between Arab-Muslims and Byzantine- Christians. The reason why this name was chosen is that Al Yarmouk holds various Greek ruins, which reminded the local people of the Byzantine Empire and how strongly it influenced Northern Arabia before Islamic times, making them appreciate the battle of Yarmouk, thus deciding on naming it after the battle which resulted in the triumph of Muslims over Christians. The club badge/emblem represents a reminder of Failaka's history as Ikarus, the name given to it by the ancient Macedonians during Alexander the Great's reign over this region, and his establishments in the island which is reflected today by the appearance of many old Greek ruins.

The British camp was built in Sulaibikhat during the British mandate, and consisted of approximately 200 bungalow-style residential units, contained within a fenced area on the Persian Gulf. After being deserted by the British at the end of the British mandate in 1961, the camp was occupied by senior government employees (doctors, engineers, pharmacists, veterinarians, lawyers, judges, etc.) working for the Government of Kuwait. The Camp had its own police station. It had its own supermarket (the \\"Salwa Market\\"), and at one stage a laundry outlet and a hairstylist. The Camp had a Club for the residents in the area with an outdoor swimming pool, three tennis clubs, a football field, and a cinema house. It was the gathering point of the youth on festive occasions. That continued to be the case until 1980, when the residents were relocated and the camp was demolished. The Camp had its own chilled water cooling facility that pumped chilled water to all 200 houses. Fan units in the houses located in each room of the house maintained cool temperatures for the occupants. The children who grew up in that camp formed a Facebook group in 2007.

He played for the Los Angeles Angels (1962‚Äì64), Detroit Tigers (1964‚Äì66), and Atlanta Braves (1970). The 5'11\\", 190 lb. right- hander with the nickname \\"Whiplash\\" was acquired by the Angels from the San Francisco Giants organization on September 2, 1962. Navarro made his major league debut in relief on September 3, 1962 against the New York Yankees in game 2 of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. He pitched three innings and gave up two earned runs in the 6‚Äì5 Angels victory. He struck out one batter, Roger Maris. He won his first major league game the very next day with 1.1 scoreless innings against New York. He retired Bobby Richardson to end the 8th, L.A. scored in the top of the 9th, and then he got Roger Maris, Elston Howard, and Johnny Blanchard to close out the game. He pitched seven more games that month, ending with a 4.70 ERA. The next season, 1963, was Navarro's best statistically. He teamed with 40-year-old Art Fowler to give the Angels a pair of dependable closers. Navarro finished in the American League top ten for games pitched (57), saves (12), and games finished (30). He was 4‚Äì5 with an ERA of 2.89. Navarro began the 1964 season in excellent fashion. He relieved in five games for the Angels with a 1.93 ERA, then was traded to the Detroit Tigers for outfielder/pitcher Willie Smith on April 28. He was never the same after that, pitching decently for Detroit but not with the degree of effectiveness he had shown with Los Angeles. He was out of the big leagues after 1966 but returned in 1970 to make 17 appearances for the Atlanta Braves. Career totals include a 7‚Äì9 record in 130 games, 1 game started, 66 games finished, 17 saves, and an ERA of 3.65. He had 151 strikeouts in 212.1 innings pitched for a 6.40 K/9IP, higher than the major league average during his era. Very good defensively, he handled 49 out of 50 total chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .980. He is the father of former major league pitcher Jaime Navarro. Navarro died peacefully January 24, 2018 in Orlando, Florida surrounded by his beloved wife and children.Fallece el exlanzador de Grandes Ligas Julio Navarro References External links *Retrosheet Category:1936 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:People from Vieques, Puerto Rico Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Los Angeles Angels players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Chicago Cubs scouts Category:Hawaii Islanders players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Cocoa Indians players ","title":"Julio Navarro (baseball)"},{"id":"7718745","text":"Al Tadhamon SC is a Kuwaiti football club based in Al Farwaniya.

More recently, the term has also been applied to a style of contemporary folk that draws from post-Bob Dylan folk music and adds new layers of musical and lyrical complexity, often incorporating various ethnic influences. History =Origins of the term= The original meaning of progressive folk came from its links to the progressive politics of the American folk revival of the 1930s, particularly through the work of musicologist Charles Seeger.G. W. Haslam, A. R. Haslam, and R. Chon, Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California (University of California Press, 1999), p. 70. Key figures in the development of progressive folk in America were Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, who influenced figures such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez in the 1960s. All mixed progressive political messages with traditional folk music tunes and themes.H. Zinn, A. Arnove, Voices of a People's History of the United States (Seven Stories Press, 2004), p. 353. In Britain, one of the major strands that emerged from the short-lived skiffle craze of 1956‚Äì9 were acoustic artists who performed American progressive material. Vital in the development of progressive folk was the emergence of the American counterculture and British underground scenes of the mid-1960s. The term progressive began to be used by radio stations to describe psychedelic music, including pop, rock and folk, that emerged from this scene.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 26. =Psychedelic folk= The first musical use of the term psychedelic is thought to have been by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of 'Hesitation Blues', a popular blues standard, in 1964.M. Hicks, Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions (University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 59‚Äì60. Psychedelic music spread rapidly in the beat folk scenes of both the east and west coast of the mid-1960s.P. Auslander, Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music (University of Michigan Press, 2006), p. 76. San Francisco produced bands such as Kaleidoscope, It's a Beautiful Day and Peanut Butter Conspiracy. From New York city's Greenwich Village came groups such as Jake and the Family Jewels and Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys. Chicago's major contribution was H. P. Lovecraft. Many of these psychedelic folk groups followed the Byrds into folk rock from 1965, are now as a result more widely remembered, including Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service.R. Unterberger, Turn! Turn! Turn!: The '60s Folk-rock Revolution (Backbeat, 1985, 2nd edn., 2005), pp. 183‚Äì230. From the mid-1960s, partly as a result of the British Invasion, this trend ran in parallel in both America and Britain and as part of the inter-related folk, folk rock and rock scenes. Folk artists who were particularly significant included the Scottish performers Donovan, who combined influences of American artists like Bob Dylan with references to flower power, and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences into their acoustic based music, including medieval and eastern instruments. There was a brief flowering of British and Irish progressive folk in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with groups like the Third Ear Band and Quintessence following the eastern Indian musical and more abstract work by groups such as Comus, Dando Shaft, Trees, Spirogyra, Forest, and Jan Dukes De Grey. =Folk baroque= The situation in Britain was made more complex by the second folk revival, which created a network of folk clubs across the country, mostly in urban centres, from the late 1950s.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival 1944‚Äì2002 (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), p. 114. In the early 1960s much of the music performed in these venues was American traditional and progressive folk, but this was increasingly discouraged from the mid-1960s as British traditional music began to dominate 'policy clubs'.G. Boyes, The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival (Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 237. Most psychedelic folk artists, particularly in London, relied more heavily on coffee houses and clubs like UFO and Middle Earth as their venues, but a number of artists occupied a musical territory between traditional and progressive music. This was particularly notable with artists like Davy Graham, Martin Carthy, Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who fused various styles of American music with English folk to create a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as 'folk baroque'.B. Swears, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005) pp. 184‚Äì9. Using medieval, jazz and blues elements in their playing, this was an overt attempt to push British folk music into new territory, and can be seen as a forerunner of progressive rock. Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from early 1970s artists like Nick Drake, Tim Buckley and John Martyn.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock: the definitive guide to more than 1200 artists and bands (Rough Guides, 2003), pp. 145, 211‚Äì12, 643‚Äì4. =Country folk= Country folk emerged as a hybrid subgenre of progressive folk and country after Dylan's visit to Nashville to record \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" in 1966. Developing as a gentler form of country with more emphasis on song writing, it continued some of the political traditions of progressive folk, being taken up in the 1970s by artists such as John Denver and Emmylou Harris and more recently contributing to the development of the progressive country subgenre.[ Country Folk], Allmusic, retrieved 28 January 2011. =Decline= In the early 1970s, psychedelia began to fall out of fashion and those folk groups that had not already moved into different areas had largely disbanded. Although artists like Dylan and Baez continued their careers with considerable success in the 1970s as American folk music began to fragment with groups focusing on areas such as blues, bluegrass and oldtime, progressive folk began to disappear as a term and its major themes shifted into 'contemporary folk', focusing on new singer- songwriters using the coffee-house circuit, including such artists as Chris Castle, Steve Goodman, and John Prine.R. Rubin, J. P. Melnick, American Popular Music: New Approaches to the Twentieth Century (University of Massachusetts Press, 2001), pp. 209‚Äì10. In Britain, folk groups also tended to electrify, as did acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, which became the electric combo T. Rex.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 40. This was a continuation of a process by which progressive folk had considerable impact on mainstream rock.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 134‚Äì5. Others, probably influenced by the British folk rock pioneered by Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span from 1969, moved towards more traditional material, a category including Dando Shaft, Amazing Blondel, and Jack the Lad, an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne. Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived (but later reunited) Comus and, more successfully, Renaissance, who combined folk and rock with classical elements. In the early 2010s, the band Moulettes was one of the most prominent progressive folk artists in the United Kingdom.

It shares many similarities with the 1986 adaptation of The Fly, and was conceived by Ray Cannella, Manager of Program Acquisition for the Syfy Channel. He and other two colleagues began producing films for the channel feeling that they could do better than the films they bought from independent producers. Plot Dr. Jennifer Allen in Baltimore, Maryland wants to find a cure for a disease known as the Gillen virus, a disease similar to, yet more deadly than, the \\"Fire Rising virus.\\" She and a colleague capture infected mosquitoes and give them small doses of radiation. She explains that the levels have to be exact because if the mosquitoes receive too much radiation, the results could be more devastating than the virus itself. A convict named Ray Erikson joins Dr. Allen's program in exchange for his lifelong prison sentence. He takes a hostage and convinces Dr. Allen to open the door to the experiment room. The security guards open fire and cause an explosion that showers Ray and Dr. Allen with the chemicals and the genetically altered mosquitoes. Ray manages to flee the scene. He begins to transform into the titular monster, a deformed chimera, half man, half mosquito, yet he manages to find his way to his ex-girlfriend's apartment, where the process continues. When the ex comes home, she finds it in ruins. She and Ray have a short, anxious conversation before Ray's transformation is complete and he kills her. Meanwhile, Dr. Allen returns home with her boyfriend, Baltimore Police Lieutenant Tom Randall. That evening, she notices her wrist is red and raw-looking. She thinks little of it, but by the next morning, it has spread to her entire arm. Later, while kissing Tom, she has a sudden craving for blood and bites him. He is called to Ray's girlfriend's apartment and leaves. Dr. Allen rushes into the bathroom to find her arm bleeding. She convulses, falls to the floor and her skin starts to bubble. Tom arrives at the crime scene and is puzzled by the way Ray's girlfriend died. He is called to investigate another crime scene, where he encounters Mansquito. The monster seems unstoppable, until Tom shocks him with a stun gun, making him flee in pain. Tom's partner doesn't believe him at first but puts a bulletin out on the creature. At the research station, Dr. Allen discovers she is also changing into a human-mosquito hybrid, but more slowly as she received a smaller dose than Ray. Mansquito appears but doesn't try to kill her, and after she faints, the monster leaves. Tom takes her to the hospital. The doctor wants to give Dr. Allen a blood transfusion to slow down the transformation, but she replies that nothing can stop the mutation. She believes the monster sensed that she is turning into a creature like him and that once the transformation is complete, he will want to mate with her. Outside, a guard falls victim to the monster and Tom leaves to investigate. Mansquito undergoes another transformation, this time growing wings. Dr. Allen also undergoes another transformation and alerts the officers of Mansquito's arrival. They fail to stop him. The monster heads for Dr. Allen, but she manages to escape. Tom fires a rocket launcher at the oxygen tanks behind Mansquito and assumes the creature was killed by the explosion, but that is not the case. Meanwhile, back at the lab, Dr. Allen undergoes yet another transformation and releases the last batch of genetically altered mosquitoes, which have been perfected. Tom arrives and Dr. Allen tells him that Mansquito is still alive. She tries to commit suicide by stabbing herself with a syringe, because without a mate, Mansquito will die. The monster arrives and Tom fights him to no avail. Dr. Allen is seriously injured by Mansquito, who is now focused on killing her rather than mating with her. Tom uses the stun gun and once again, it works. Seeing this, Dr. Allen breaks an electrical line and electrocutes Mansquito, sacrificing herself.

Reception Dread Central awarded the film a score of 3 out of 5. Noting the film's shortcomings and rudimentary plot but complimented the film's creature design, and gore effects, stating \\"Mansquito is a fun throwback to the b-movies of yore that‚Äôs more entertaining than it has any right to be. Perhaps it was just dumb luck or maybe the law of averages finally caught up with them but the Sci-Fi Channel finally produced a winner.\\" Chris Carle from IGN gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"a lurching mess of silly logic, odd casting, bad CG and 1960's Japan-quality monster suit effects.\\" HorrorNews.net while noting the film's faults, the reviewer felt that the makers did a decent enough job with the film to make it enjoyable. Felix Vasquez from Cinema Crazed gave the film a mostly positive review, writing, \\"This is another one of those so bad they‚Äôre good films with a really ridiculous concept, but overall you can‚Äôt help but like it a lot. With some great special effects, good gore, hilarious moments, and bad acting, you can‚Äôt take this too seriously. Enter with an open mind and you‚Äôll enjoy it, like I did.\\" David Cornelius from eFilmCritic awarded the film 2/5 stars, writing, \\"It pains me to say that none of this is nearly as fun as it should have been. Any movie with a plot this insane must, by all accounts, be either outrageously stupid or deliciously, self-consciously entertaining. Mansquito is neither. Aside from a few moments of uncontrollable idiocy (mostly involving the grand miscasting of nice guy Nemic as badass cop), there's very little here that manages to do anything other than bore.\\" References External links  Parker Lewis Star Swats Mansquito, Corin Nemec Category:2005 films Category:2005 television films Category:2000s monster movies Category:2000s science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:Horror television films Category:American science fiction television films Category:American monster movies Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:Nu Image films Category:Syfy original films Category:American science fiction horror films ","title":"Mansquito"},{"id":"7718874","text":"Louis Boisrond Tonnerre on a Haitian postage stamp for the 150-year anniversary of the Haitian Revolution, (1804-1954). Louis F√©lix Mathurin Boisrond-Tonnerre (born 6 June 1776; executed 24 October 1806), better known as simply Boisrond-Tonnerre, was a Haitian writer and historian who is best known for having served as Jean-Jacques Dessalines' secretary. Boisrond- Tonnerre was educated in Paris until 1798 when he returned to Haiti (Daut 56). He is the author of the 1804 Independence Act of Haiti, which formally declared Haiti's independence from the colonial rule of France. He is also known for his work chronicling the Haitian Revolution, M√©moires pour Servir √† l'Histoire d'Ha√Øti. Boisrond-Tonnerre was born Louis Boisrond in Torbeck in southwest Haiti. He acquired the name \\"Tonnerre\\", French for \\"thunder\\", as an infant when his cradle was hit by lightning. His father, a carpenter named Mathurin Boisrond (see Daut below), amazed that his infant son was unharmed, gave him the name \\"Tonnerre\\". Boisrond-Tonnerre studied in France before returning to Haiti, where he took part in the Haitian Revolution. Boisront- Tonnerre became a victim of post-revolutionary infighting and was executed in October 1806. According to the Haitian author Christophe Phillippe Charles, Boisrond-Tonnerre scribbled the following quatrain on the walls of his cell before his execution on either the night of 23 or 24 October 1806: > Humide et froid s√©jour fait par et pour le crime > O√π le crime en riant immole sa victime > Que peuvent inspirer tes fers et tes barreaux > Quand un c≈ìur pur y go√ªte un innocent repos? (Christophe 35). Translation : > Cold and humid internment crime has both fashioned and formed > Where crime, laughing, immolates and consumes its servant > But what [fear] can your iron bars hope to inspire > When a pure heart wrests from them a peaceful rest? (Christophe 35) Dessalines had been assassinated seven or eight days prior on 17 October in Port-au-Prince.

The first boat was located 43 nautical miles north of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, while the second was detected approximately 15 nautical miles northwest of Desecheo Island, Puerto Rico. Both vessels were transiting the Mona Pass without navigational lights. Coast Guard Watchstanders in Sector San Juan diverted the Escanaba to interdict the suspect vessels. Shortly thereafter, the Escanaba interdicted a 20-foot makeshift boat with 19 adult migrants on board. The Escanaba crew embarked 14 men and five women, who claimed Dominican nationality. Following the first interdiction, the Escanaba proceeded to intercept the second migrant vessel. Once on scene, an Escanaba small boat crew and a CBP Caribbean Air and Marine interceptor surface unit stopped a 25-foot makeshift boat with 21 adult migrants on board.

It was ported to the Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore 16 and Plus/4. The game is set in the Wild West, and its name is a reference to the main character of the film High Noon. It consists of four distinct scenes, although some versions only contain two. A sequel was released in 1988. Gameplay The player takes the role of sheriff of the town of Kane. The game is split into four levels, two of which are shooting games using an on-screen target and two of which are side- scrolling action sequences on horseback. Only the shooting levels are present in all versions of the game. These may be played separately in the practice mode (with only one try given), but in order to complete and win the game, they must be played successively. The progress in the first scene defines the tries given in the next scenes. Scene 1 on the Commodore 64Scene 4 on the ZX SpectrumScene 1: The player controls a target and must shoot birds with a bow and arrow in order to trade with the Indians. The birds appear at varying altitude from the left and fly horizontally to the right. At higher difficulty levels the speed also varies. The player starts with ten arrows. As the arrows take time to reach the target and the birds are moving, the player must anticipate the position the birds will be when the arrow reaches them. If the shot is successful, the arrow returns to the quiver, but arrows that miss are lost. It is possible to take down more than one bird with a single shot if the falling bird hits another as it plummets. The player can kill no more than forty birds or no more than forty birds can be let away (a tally of each is kept on screen). After the limit is reached or the quiver is empty, the player proceeds to the next scene, provided he has killed enough birds to trade for at least one 'peace token'. The number of birds required for a token depends on the difficulty level, beginning with three. The tokens earned in this scene act as the lives for the following scenes. Scene 2: The player is on horseback and must ride to the town of Kane in a set time limit. The player must canter left to right or gallop to overcome wide obstacles. There are a number of obstacles (bushes, rocks, etc.) that the player must avoid by jumping over. The peace tokens are spent if the horse collides with an obstacle, and if the last medal is spent, the rider gives up and it is game over. Scene 3: When the player reaches the town, he is ambushed by outlaws. The player controls the aim of a revolver, but unlike the first scene, the character on screen also moves left and right with the aim movement. The outlaws appear from cover at varying positions in the town and shoot at the player. The player must shoot ten outlaws, avoiding being shot himself. At higher difficulty levels, the bandits are quicker and more accurate. The players' revolver has six bullets. At any time the player can move to the rightmost position to reload the weapon, but he is still vulnerable when reloading. The peace tokens are spent if the player is shot. Scene 4: The player is on horseback again and must catch a moving train, this time moving from right to left. The train is travelling at the horse's canter speed, so the player must gallop faster than the train to reach the steam-engine and stop the train. As in scene 2, the horse must jump obstacles. These are more diverse and complicated and require a perfect knowledge of their order. At higher levels the player starts further from the engine and has to gallop longer. The peace tokens are spent if the horse collides with an obstacle. After successfully completing the scenes, the game then repeats with greater difficulty. Release The game was first released on the Commodore 64 in early 1986. It was then ported to Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum, featuring all four scenes, and Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, and Commodore 16/Plus/4 with only the shooting scenes included (scenes 1 and 3 in the original game). Despite this, the BBC/Electron inlay gives instructions for all four scenes. This was corrected on the C16/Plus 4 inlay. All releases were in Mastertronic's ¬£1.99 range. Reception Reviews for the game were mixed, possibly reflecting the relative quality of the different versions of the game. The original version on the C64 was given a generally positive review in Zzap!64 with particular praise being given to the sampled sound effects and animation of the main sprites (although they alleged that the main character is stolen from Impossible Mission). The music comes in for criticism with the backgrounds and short nature of the game also being questioned but the game is recommended as \\"worth every penny of the measly two quid asking price\\" with an overall score of 63%.Kane review, Zzap!64, March 1986 In direct contrast, their review of the C16 version in the Zzap!C16 supplement, the background graphics are praised but they claim \\"the movement of the main sprite leaves a little to be desired\\" giving an overall score of 48%.Kane review, Zzap!C16 supplement, Zzap!64, August 1987 The Amstrad version (which is the most similar to the original) was particularly well received, scoring 70% in both Amstrad Action and Amtix!.Kane at The Amstrad CPC Games Resource The Spectrum version gained less favourable reviews. Your Sinclair was particularly critical, giving a score of only 3/10, complaining of the \\"luridly coloured\\" background graphics and the \\"dreadfully repetitive\\" gameplay.Kane review, Your Sinclair, September 1986 Graham Taylor of Sinclair User could find only the character animation worthy of praise saying \\"the rest stinks\\", giving a score of 2/5.Kane review, Graham Taylor, Sinclair User, October 1986 Crash gave a slightly higher score of 54% but were still mostly dismissive and did not recommend the game, claiming it was inferior to the original: \\"Mastertronic seem to have taken their time translating this to the Spectrum - and to be honest they shouldn't have bothered\\".Kane review, Crash, October 1986 Jon Revis of Electron User was also unimpressed with the Acorn version, criticising the unresponsive controls and especially the fact that scenes 2 and 4, as described in the inlay, are missing from the game: \\"It's a pity the programmer didn't read [the inlay]. The game may only cost ¬£1.99 but I can't help feeling Mastertronic will receive a few letters of complaint about this one\\". The game was given a score of 4/10 for playability but an overall score of 6/10.\\"Kane In For A Caning\\", Jon Revis, Electron User, December 1986 Legacy Kane 2 was released in 1988 for the C64 but was not ported to any other machines. It is very similar to the first game with almost identical graphics and gameplay. Scene 1 is a riding and shooting level, scene 2 is a shooting level (like scene 3 in the first game), scene 3 is a challenge to tame a bronco and scene 4 is a riding level. The lack of improvement over two years after the original lead to negative reviews. Zzap!64 gave a score of 33% and said \\"It's not abysmal, it's just that it doesn't really approach the standards required of a good budget program these days.

On 1 October 2013, the unit was renamed in the course of adaptations to the new structure of the German Air Force. JG 74 provides air defence duties for southern Germany. The wing operates two squadrons of Eurofighter Typhoons, the Falken (Falcons) squadron and the Viva Zapata squadron. History JG 74 was activated as the last West German fighter wing on 5 May 1961. It was equipped with the F-86K Sabre interceptor and first based at Leipheim in 1960 as JG 75. It moved to Neuburg Air Base a short time later after this base had been opened and was renamed JG 74. In the period from 1964/66 JG 74 received the F-104G Starfighter. The Starfighter proved to be a troublesome aircraft for the Luftwaffe, which lost 292 of 916 Starfighters, 116 pilots died. JG 74 also lost several of them until the wing converted to the F-4F Phantom II in 1974. The F-4F was a downgraded F-4E which could not fire the medium range AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. The use was forbidden until Germany became fully sovereign in 1990. Since then the F-4Fs were upgraded to F-4F ICE standard in the 1990s and were finally equipped to use the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. Due to the smoke generated by the F-4's General Electric J79 engines, the German pilots dubbed the F-4F the \\"Air Defence Diesel\\". The last of the F-4Fs was retired on 12 June 2008. From 2006 to June 2008 JG 74 transitioned to the Eurofighter Typhoon. M√∂lders 32 years after the crash and death of the German World War II fighter ace Werner M√∂lders, JG 74 received the honorary name of \\"JG 74 M√∂lders\\" on 22 November 1973. However, the German parliament decided in 1998 that it is not proper to name organizations after people who were active in the Legion Condor. The German Military History Institute researched M√∂lders conduct and concluded that he concurred in his actions with the Nazi government, and never opposed any actions taken by the Nazis. Therefore, the name \\"M√∂lders\\" was dropped by JG 74 on 11 June 2005.:de:Werner M√∂lders Gallery File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F027408-0001, Flugzeug F-86 K Sabre des JG 74.jpgAn F-86K Sabre of JG 74.

Inaugural congress 2006 The founding congress of the ITUC was held from 1 to 3 November 2006 in Vienna, Austria. The first day of the congress saw the formal creation of the ITUC followed by an address by Juan Somavia, the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Day two included Pascal Lamy, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) responding to panel discussions on the impact of globalisation, including the topics \\"Cohesion and chaos - the global institutions\\" and \\"Global unions - global companies\\". Technical difficulties limited Lamy's satellite video link participation. Leadership and officers were elected on the final day of the congress. Guy Ryder, the former general secretary of the ICFTU, was elected to the same position in the new organisation. Sharan Burrow was elected president. A Governing Council was established, with 70 elected members, and 8 additional seats reserved for youth and women‚Äôs representatives. A Council of Global Unions was also formed on the final day of the congress. It was established jointly with ten global union federations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC). Second congress 2010 The second congress of the ITUC was held from 21 to 25 June 2010 in Vancouver, Canada. On 25 June 2010, at the conclusion of the congress, Sharan Burrow (then ITUC President) was elected General Secretary, succeeding Guy Ryder (who had been elected as Deputy Director General of the International Labour Organization). In anticipation of her election, Burrow had resigned from her position as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions effective 1 July 2010. Speaking to the Congress after her election, Burrow paid tribute to her predecessor and emphasised the continuing role of organised labour in the world's emergence from the Global Financial Crisis. She also made special mention of the significance of her election as the first female leader of the world's largest trade union (against a background of high workforce participation by women and a Congress 50% of whose delegates were women): > I am a warrior for woman and we still have work to ensure the inclusion of > women in the work place and in our unions. The struggles for women are > multiple ‚Äì too often within their families for independence, then in the > workplace for rights and equal opportunity, in their unions for access and > representation and then as union leaders. But the investment in and > participation of women is not only a moral mandate it is an investment in > democracy and a bulwark against fundamentalism and oppression. Organising > woman is and must continue to be a priority for the ITUC. Organisation Countries in light blue have an ITUC affiliate The Pan- European Regional Council (PERC), a European trade union organisation within the ITUC was formed 19 March 2007. It consists of 87 national trade union centres and a total membership of 87 million. It works closely with the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). The ITUC raises capital through charging dues to its member organisations.

Over the years, development changed hands several times with PCSX- Reloaded (PCSXR) now being the main version. PCSX has a high compatibility rate and is currently available for a number of different operating systems including Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. It is released under the GNU General Public License.  History  The emulator was first released for the PC on August 31, 2000. Official development ceased on September 17, 2003, and development shifted to the new PlayStation 2 emulator, PCSX2. PCSX-df was created in 2006 and added new features, a new GTK-based interface, AMD64 support, and corrected some bugs, but was developed mainly with only Linux compatibility in mind. Version 1.10 was released on March 29, 2009. PCSX- Reloaded is a new project created in mid-2009, which is based on the work of the PCSX-df branch, completely independent, and works on bug fixes while maintaining Windows and OS X compatibility alongside Linux. PCSX-df and PCSX- Reloaded coexisted for a while, with PCSX-df merging changes of PCSX-Reloaded back into df.  Features  PCSX supports network play and external plugins as used by ePSXe. As with many modern emulators PCSX-Reloaded supports savestates and also has Save Rewind feature (currently only OSX and Linux version), Support for ECM files (currently only OS X and Linux version), Support for Libarchive (currently only OSX and Linux version), widescreen hack and makes use of plug-ins to emulate GPU, SPU, and CD-ROM drive functions, a model first established in PSEmu Pro, it uses Peops OpenGL plugin for graphics on default but can also use Pete's OpenGL2, gpuBladeSoft, PCSX2 graphics plugin GSDX, AmiDog GPU plugin, Asmodeans PSXFX shader pack, input plugins such as Lilypad and Pokopom Pad Plugin. It also has multi-track cue support and is the only PS1 emulator with compatibility with anti-jitter options in graphics plugins, such as GTE accuracy in the default Peops OpenGL plugin, or Improved coordinate accuracy in Edgbla's gpuBladeSoft and it also supports PeteOpenGL2Tweak plugin. Additionally, PCSX seeks to simulate the functionality of the PlayStation BIOS and consequently does not require a BIOS file dump to operate, making it easier to emulate legally, however Bios emulation is still incomplete so its better to use dumped BIOS to avoid various bugs and reduced compatibility.  Ports and commercial usage  Linux, macOS/OS X, and Microsoft Windows on x86-based computers are the main development focus of PCSX-Reloaded but various PCSX iterations have been ported to other platforms as well, including Dreamcast, GameCube, PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox, and various ARM-based platforms (PCSX-Rearmed fork) such as BlackBerry Playbook and Nintendo 3DS. = Usage = PCSXR was used for an official port and commercial re-release of N2O: Nitrous Oxide on Steam on June 29, 2015.Console Classics Update on steamcommunity.com \\"Hi all! Thanks so much for trying out N2O! We‚Äôre really excited with our first release of a classic game on Steam\\"First psx emulated game on steam N2O: Nitrous Oxide on emutalk.net by LyonHrt (July 1st, 2015) It is also used as the emulator on Sony's PlayStation Classic dedicated console.

It replaced stamp mills for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare. However, the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer, more easily hydrated, and more fibrillated cellulose fibers; thus increasing the resulting paper's strength. The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material, resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper. Further, the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another. These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called foxing. thumb In turn, the Hollander was (partially) replaced by the conical refiner or Jordan refiner, named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan, who patented the device in 1858. A Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate, similar to the construction of a water wheel or timing pulley. Under power, the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry. The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the beater. The objective of using a beater (rather than another process like grinding, as many wood-pulp mills do) is to create longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for hydrogen bonding). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the \\"blades\\" are not what might be thought of as \\"sharpened\\", and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.

It is known for former Memleben Abbey, the site of a medieval Kaiserpfalz. Geography It is located southwest of Nebra on the Unstrut River. The former municipality was merged with the neighbouring villages of Bucha and Wohlmirstedt into Kaiserpfalz on 1 July 2009. Memleben from the bridge over the river Unstrut Nowadays the village has about 800 inhabitants. It also has an animal exhibition park with a small circus. History A settlement called Mimelebo was already documented in a 780 register of the Hersfeld Abbey estates, issued by Archbishop Lullus of Mainz. In the 10th century the Pfalz or villa regia of Memleben, a kind of seasonal king's court, was one of the favourite places of the German king Henry the Fowler and his son Emperor Otto I. Henry the Fowler died here, probably by a stroke, on 2 July 936; his son Emperor Otto I also used Memleben as a temporary residence and died here on 7 May 973. According to the Res gestae saxonicae by the contemporary chronicler Widukind of Corvey, his intestines were buried in a Memleben church. On behalf of Emperor Otto II, son of Otto I, the Benedictine Memleben monastery was built there from about 979 to honour the memory of his father. The Imperial abbey became one of the most important monasteries in the German kingdom for a short time, until in 1015 Emperor Henry II ceded it back to the monks of Hersfeld Abbey. The monastery buildings were devastated during the German Peasants' War in 1525. After the Protestant Reformation the abbey was finally dissolved in 1548, its estates were seized by the Electorate of Saxony and ceded to the newly established Pforta state school. Remains of the church and the monastery are still to be seen.

Early life and education He was born at Sedgwick Park, near Horsham, Sussex, the third child of Robert and Emma Henderson.Appeasing Hitler: The Diplomacy of Sir Nevile Henderson, 1937‚Äì39, Peter Neville, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, p. 1. His uncle was Reginald Hargreaves, who married Alice Liddell, the original of Alice in Wonderland.Sir Nevile Henderson, Water Under the Bridges, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1945, p. 10. https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.524087/2015.524087.Water- Under#page/n221/mode/2up Henderson was very attached to the countryside of Sussex, especially his home of Sedgwick, and wrote in 1940: \\"Each time that I returned to England the white cliffs of Dover meant Sedgwick for me, and when my mother died in 1931 and my home was sold by my elder brother's wife, something went out of my life which nothing can replace\\". Henderson was extremely close to his mother, Emma, a strong-willed woman who had successfully managed the estate at Sedgwick after her husband's death in 1895 and developed the gardens of Sedgwick so well that they were photographed by Country Life magazine in 1901. Henderson called his mother \\"the presiding genius of Sedgwick\\" who was a \\"wonderful and masterful woman if ever there was one\\". He was educated at Eton and joined the Diplomatic Service in 1905. He was, as one historian notes, \\"something of a snob\\", although another historian states that his snobbishness mostly derived from the death of his mother. Henderson had a great love of sports, guns, and hunting, and those who knew him noted he was always most happy when he was out on the hunt. Henderson was also known for his love of clothing and always wore the most expensive Savile Row suits and a red carnation. He was considered to be one of the most best dressed men in the Foreign Office, being obsessed with the proper fashion even during long-distance rail voyages. Henderson's obsession with his wardrobe, social etiquette, and hunting was part of a carefully cultivated image that he sought for himself as a polished Edwardian gentleman. Henderson never married, but his biographer, Peter Neville, wrote that \\"women played an important role in his life\\". Henderson's lifelong bachelorhood did not cause questions about his sexuality; Baron Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, wrote in his diary that Henderson was a \\"ladies' man\\". Ambassador to Turkey In the early 1920s, Henderson was stationed at the embassy in Turkey, where he played an important role in the often difficult relations between Britain and the new Turkish Republic. Henderson had wanted a posting in France, rather than Turkey, where he constantly complained to his superiors about being sent. During his time in Turkey, Henderson played a major role in the negotiations about the Mosul dispute, which had been caused by Turkish President Mustafa Kemal's claim to the Mosul region of Iraq. Henderson was forceful in upholding the British claim to the region. but was prepared to yield to Turkish demands for Constantinople. He argued that Britain had been shown to have a very weak hand by the Chanak Crisis in 1922, which revealed that public opinion in Britain and its dominions was unwilling go to war over the issue. Ambassador to France and Yugoslavia Henderson served as an envoy to France in 1928 to 1929 and as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1935. He did not want the latter post, whose British legation was considered to be an unglamorous post, compared to the \\"grand embassies\\" in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Moscow, Vienna, Madrid and Washington. He had been lobbying for a major post in the Paris embassy and, expecting to move back to Paris soon, continued to pay the rent for his apartment there for some time after moving to Belgrade. During his time in Belgrade, Henderson became a very close friend of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who shared his love of hunting and guns. In January 1929, having been a constitutional monarch, Alexander had staged a self-coup, abolished democracy and made himself the dictator of Yugoslavia. Henderson had a strong tendency towards hero worship and found in Alexander a hero worthy of his admiration who could do no wrong. Henderson's dispatches from Belgrade took on a notably pro-Yugoslav tone. His friendship with Alexander notably increased British influence in Yugoslavia, which first brought him attention in the Foreign Office. As would be the case during his time in Berlin, Henderson took exception to any negative remark in the British press about Yugoslavia and wrote to the Foreign Office to ask if anything could be done to silence such criticism. After Alexander's assassination in Marseilles, France, in October 1934, Henderson wrote: \\"I felt more emotion at King Alexander's funeral than I felt at any other except my mother's\\". Henderson wrote to a friend in Britain in 1935: \\"My sixth winter in the Belgrade trenches is the worse of all. The zest has gone out of it with King Alexander gone. It interested me enormously to play Stockmar to his Albert and that made all the difference\\". Henderson was also in close confidence with Prince Paul, the regent of Yugoslavia on behalf of Alexander's son, Peter II, who was only a boy. In January 1935, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Robert \\"Van\\" Vansittart sharply rebuked him for a letter he had written to Paul in which Henderson strongly supported Yugoslavia's complaints against Italy. Vansittart complained particularly about Henderson's claim that the Italian government supported Croat and Macedonian separatist terrorists and that Italy had been involved in Alexander's assassination: \\"Are we convinced of this and do we wish Prince Paul to think that we are convinced of it\\". Ambassador to Argentina In 1935, he became ambassador to Argentina. Ambassador to Germany On 28 May 1937, Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden appointed him ambassador in Berlin. After he had been prime minister, Harold Macmillan, wrote of that appointment: Eden wanted an ambassador in Berlin who could get along well with dictators, and Vansittart gave him a list of three diplomats who had shown a strong partiality towards autocratic leaders: Henderson, Sir Percy Loraine and Sir Miles Lampson. In his 1956 memoirs, The Mist Procession, Vansittart wrote about the appointment of Henderson: \\"Nevile Henderson... made such a hit with the dictator [King Alexander] by his skill at shooting that he was ultimately picked for Berlin. All know the consequences\\". Henderson's promotion from being the ambassador in Buenos Aires to being the ambassador in Berlin, which was regarded as one of the \\"grand embassies\\" in the Foreign Office, was a major boost to his ego. Henderson wrote at the time that he believed he had been \\"specially selected by Providence for the definite mission of I trusted, helping to preserve the peace of the world\\". As he crossed the Atlantic on a ship to take him back to Britain, Henderson read Mein Kampf in the original German version to acquaint himself with the thinking of Adolf Hitler. Henderson wrote in his 1940 The Failure of a Mission that he was determined \\"to see the good side of the Nazi regime as well as the bad, and to explain as objectively as I could its aspirations and viewpoint to His Majesty's Government\\". Upon arriving in London, Henderson met the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, who was due to replace Stanley Baldwin as prime minister the next month, for a briefing about the Berlin mission. Some controversy has ensued over just what precisely Chamberlain told Henderson. In his book Failure of a Mission, Henderson wrote that Chamberlain \\"outlined to me his views on the general policy towards Germany and I think I may honestly say to the last and bitter end I followed the general line which he set me, all the easily and faithfully since it corresponded so closely with my own private conception of the service I could best render in Germany to my own country\\". Henderson was to claim that Chamberlain had authorised him to commit \\"calculated indiscretions\\" in the pursuit of peace, but the German-born American historian Abraham Ascher wrote that no evidence has emerged to support that claim. T. Philip Conwell-Evans, a British historian who taught German history at K√∂nigsberg University, later claimed that Henderson had told him that Chamberlain had made him his personal envoy to Germany who was to bypass Vansittart by taking orders directly from Chamberlain's office. Regardless of what Chamberlain said to Henderson in April 1937, Henderson always seemed to have regarded himself as directly answerable to 10 Downing Street and showed a marked tendency to ignore Vansittart. A believer in appeasement, Henderson thought Hitler could be controlled and pushed toward peace and cooperation with the Western powers. Like almost all of the British elite in the interwar era, Henderson believed that the Treaty of Versailles was far too harsh on Germany and that if only the terms of Versailles were revised in Germany's favour, another world war could be prevented. Neville wrote that the charge that Henderson was pro-Nazi was incorrect since Henderson had advocated the revision of Versailles in Germany's favour long before Hitler had come to power. By contrast, Ascher credited Henderson's beliefs on avoiding war to his desire to uphold white supremacy and to avoid another \\"fratricidal\\" war between white peoples while Asian, black and brown peoples started to demand equality. Ascher cited Henderson's dispatch to Eden on 26 January 1938 that warned that another Anglo-German war \\"would be... absolutely disastrous - I cannot imagine and would be unwilling to survive the defeat of the British Empire. At the same time, I would view with dismay another defeat of Germany, which would merely serve the purposes of inferior races\\". Shortly after arriving in Berlin, Henderson started to clash with Vansittart, who complained that Henderson was exceeding his brief and becoming too close to the Nazi leaders, especially Hermann G√∂ring, who became Henderson's best friend. Henderson first met G√∂ring on 24 May 1937 and admitted to having a \\"real personal liking\\" for him. The same tendency towards hero worship that Henderson had displayed towards King Alexander in Belgrade reasserted itself in Berlin towards G√∂ring, as Henderson had a fascination with militaristic authority figures. G√∂ring shared Henderson's love of hunting and guns, and both frequently went off together on hunting trips in the forests of Germany. Eden sharply criticised Henderson for not challenging G√∂ring's statement that the German people should not look upon Britain as \\"an enemy in their path\\" and that closer Anglo-German ties were needed, as the statement implied that current British foreign policy was anti- German. In one of his \\"calculated indiscretions\\", Henderson broke with the unwritten rule in the Foreign Office that ambassadors should never criticise their predecessors by telling G√∂ring that Sir Eric Phipps had been too insensitive towards German concerns. In June 1937, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King visited Berlin to meet Hitler. Mackenzie King told Henderson that Hitler had said that \\"they all liked him and felt he had a good understanding of German problems\\", a remark that appealed much to Henderson's vanity. Hitler called Henderson \\"the man with the carnation\\", in reference to the red carnation Henderson that always wore, and despised him. He found Henderson to be too superior in his manners for his liking. In contrast to his close friendship with G√∂ring, Henderson's relationship with Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was extremely antagonistic. Henderson detested Ribbentrop and wrote to King George VI that Ribbentrop was \\"eaten up with conceit\\". Henderson argued that the Nazi regime was divided into factions, which he called the \\"moderates\\" and the \\"extremists\\". Henderson regarded G√∂ring as the leader of the \\"moderates\\", which also included the Wehrmacht officer corps, the Reichsbank officials, the professional diplomats of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt and the officials of the Economics Ministry, and the \\"extremists\\" were Ribbentrop, Josef Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler. Henderson argued that Britain should work to revise the international system established by the Treaty of Versailles in favour of Germany, which would strengthen the \\"moderates\\" in Germany and weaken the \\"extremists\\", as the best way of preventing another world war. Henderson regarded all aims of the \\"moderates\\", such as the return of the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Corridor, Upper Silesia, the lost colonies in Africa, the Anschluss with Austria and the Sudetenland joining Germany as being reasonable and just. When Henderson accepted G√∂ring's invitation to attend the 1937 Nazi Party Rally in Nuremberg without consulting the Foreign Office, Vansittart was furious and wrote that it was \\"extraordinary\\" that Henderson should \\"not only take an important decision like this off his own bat without giving us a chance at consultation... but also announce it to a foreign colleague as a decision\\". Vansittart wrote to Henderson that he should not attend the Nuremberg Rally since \\"you would be suspected of giving countenance or indeed eulogy (as alleged by one Member of Parliament) to the Nazi system\\", and the Foreign Office would be accused of having \\"fascist leanings\\". Henderson wrote back that \\"one has to be empirical to a certain degree and since Nazism could not be wished away, what was the point of being discourteous to Hitler and unnecessarily irritating to him?\\" Henderson's attendance at the rally was widely interpreted by the Nazis as granting his official approval of their ideology. At the same time, Henderson described the \\"Strength Through Joy\\" movement and the labour camps for young people as showing the \\"beneficial\\" aspects of Hitler's rule and ensured that the young Germans developed properly-patriotic attitudes towards the fatherland. Henderson called the rally (10-11 September 1937) a most impressive event attended by some 140,000 Germans, who were full of enthusiasm for the regime. Henderson wrote that his hosts in Nuremberg went out of their way to be friendly towards him by giving him a luxurious apartment to stay in and inviting him to sumptuous meals with the best German food and wine being served. From Nuremberg, Henderson reported to London: However, Henderson saw no reason for alarm and wrote that \\"we are perhaps entering the quieter phrase of Nazism, of which the first indication has been the greater tranquility of the 1937 meeting [at Nuremberg].\\" Henderson spoke with Hitler at Nuremberg and described him as seeking \\"reasonableness\\" in foreign affairs with a special interest in reaching an \\"Anglo-German understanding\\". Because Hitler's speech at Nuremberg had demanded that Britain and France return the former German colonies in Africa, Henderson came away with the impression that for Hitler, the restoration of the German colonial empire in Africa was his principal foreign policy interest. The British historian Andrew Crozier wrote that the thesis developed by the German historian Klaus Hildebrand of \\"colonial blackmail\\" that for Hitler, the demands for lost colonies in Africa were meant to \\"blackmail\\" Britain into giving Germany a \\"free hand in the East\\" to be well supported by the available evidence. On 16 March 1938, Henderson wrote to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, to set out his view: \\"British interests and the standard of morality can only be combined if we insist upon the fullest possible equality for the Sudeten minority of Czechoslovakia\\". Unlike Basil Newton, the British minister in Prague, Henderson initially advocated plans to turn Czechoslovakia into a federation and wrote to Halifax \\"how to secure, if we can, the integrity of Czechoslovakia\\". At a meeting with Vojtech Mastny, the Czechoslovak minister in Berlin, on 30 March 1938, Henderson admitted that Czechoslovakia had the best record for the treatment of its minorities in Eastern Europe but criticised Czechoslovakia for being a unitary state, which he argued caused too many problems in a state made up of Czechs, Slovaks, Magyars, Germans, Poles and Ukrainians. Henderson told Mastny that he felt that becoming a \\"Federal State\\" was Czechoslovakia's best hope and wanted Czechoslovakia to reorient its foreign policy upon \\"Prague-Berlin-Paris axis\\", instead of the existing \\"Prague-Paris-Moscow axis\\". In the spring of 1938, Henderson formed an alliance with Newton to work together to persuade decisionmakers in London to side with Germany against Czechoslovakia. When Henderson sent Newton a private letter praising him for his pro-German dispatches on 19 May 1938, the latter replied with a letter saying that he hoped Henderson would \\"be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and when that is done, I hope I may receive honourable mention. You have much the hardest job\\". During the May Crisis of 20-21 May 1938, Henderson was badly shaken by the partial Czechoslovak mobilisation, which, for Henderson, proved that President Edvard Bene≈° was dangerous and reckless. At the same time, Henderson formed alliances with Baron Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt; Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, the French ambassador in Berlin; and Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian ambassador in Berlin to work together to \\"manage\\" Germany's return to great power status peacefully. Acting independently of their own national governments, Weizs√§cker, Attolico, Henderson and Fran√ßois-Poncet all worked together in a common front on one hand to sabotage the plans of Hitler and Ribbentrop to attack Czechoslovakia and to ensure that the Sudetenland, the ostensible object of the German- Czechoslovak dispute, was handed over to Germany. Attolico, Weizs√§cker, Henderson and Fran√ßois-Poncet would meet in secret to discuss in French to share information and to devise strategies to stop a war in 1938. Weizs√§cker and Henderson both wanted a peaceful \\"chemical dissolution of Czechoslovakia\\", instead of the \\"mechanical dissolution\\" of war, which was favoured by Hitler and Ribbentrop. During Henderson's time in Berlin, he was closer to Weizs√§cker than to any other German official except G√∂ring. Henderson with Chamberlain and Ribbentrop at Hotel Petersberg, September 1938 Despite his earlier pro- Yugoslav views, Henderson started to display strong anti-Slavic views during his time in Berlin. He wrote writing to Lord Halifax on 22 August 1938, \\"The Teuton and the Slav are irreconcilable-just as are the Briton and the Slav. Mackenzie King told me last year after the Imperial Conference that the Slavs in Canada never assimilated with the people and never became good citizens\\". As the crisis over the Sudetenland region intensified in September 1938, Henderson became convinced that Britain should not fight a major war with Germany, which jeopardised the British Empire, over the Sudetenland, especially since he believed that it had been \\"unjust\\" in the first place for the Treaty of Versailles to have assigned the Sudetenland to Czechoslovakia. In September 1938, Henderson, along with Halifax and Sir Horace Wilson, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the government, were the only ones aware of Chamberlain's Plan Z to have the Prime Minister fly to Germany to meet Hitler personally and to find out just exactly it was that he wanted with the Sudetenland. After Hitler gave his keynote speech at the 1938 Nuremberg Party Rally on 12 September 1938 demanding Bene≈° to allow the Sudetenland to join Germany or Czechoslovakia to be invaded, Henderson who had attended the rally, reported to London that Hitler \\"driven by the megalomania inspired by the military force which he has built up... he may have crossed the borderline into insanity\\". In the same dispatch, Henderson wrote he could not speak with \\"certitude\\" over what Germany might do as \\"everything depends on the psychology of one abnormal individual\\". Henderson spoke with Hitler after he gave his speech at the rally and reported that Hitler \\"even while addressing the Hitler Youth\\" was so nervous that he could not relax, which led to Henderson to conclude, \\"His abnormality seemed to me even greater than ever\\". Despite Henderson's belief that Hitler might have actually gone mad, he still found much to admire about him and wrote that he had \\"sublime faith in his own mission and that of Germany in the world\\" and \\"he is a constructive genius, a builder and no mere demagogue\\". Henderson did not believe that Hitler wanted all of Czechoslovakia and wrote to Halifax that all that Hitler wanted was to secure \\"fair and honorable treatment for the Austro- and Sudeten Germans\\", even at the price of war, but Hitler \\"hates war as much as anyone\\". Henderson was ambassador at the time of the 1938 Munich Agreement and counselled Chamberlain to agree to it. Shortly thereafter, he returned to London for medical treatment, returning to Berlin in ill health in February 1939 (he would die of cancer less than four years later).Appeasing Hitler: The Diplomacy of Sir Nevile Henderson, 1937‚Äì39, findarticles.com; accessed 2 October 2014. Sir Oliver Harvey, Halifax's Private Secretary, wrote in September 1938, \\"Nevile Henderson's very presence here is a danger as he infects the Cabinet with his gibber\\". In October 1938, Henderson was diagnosed with cancer, which causes him to leave for London. From October 1938 to February 1939, the British Embassy in Berlin was run by the charg√© d'affaires, Sir George Ogilvie-Forbes, a member of the Scottish gentry and a proteg√© of Vansittart. The dispatches from Berlin changed markedly as Ogilvie-Forbes stated his belief that Hitler's aims went beyond revising the Treaty of Versailles towards winning Germany \\"world power status\\". Ogilvie-Forbes wrote to London 6 December 1938 that based on the information that he received, he believed that Hitler would start a war sometime in 1939 with Hitler divided only about whatever it would be in Western Europe or in Eastern Europe. Unlike Henderson, who tended to gloss over the sufferings of German Jews, Ogilvie- Forbes gave far more attention to Nazi anti-Semitism. Ascher, himself a German Jew, noted in Ogilvie-Forbes's dispatches to London that there was a real sense of personal empathy with the sufferings of German Jews, which Henderson never displayed. After Hitler gave his \\"Prophecy Speech\\" to the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, Ogilvie-Forbes predicated that the \\"extermination\\" of Jews in Germany \\"can only be a matter of time\\". Henderson, by contrast, wrote that \\"Jews and Communists\\" were the principal \\"warmongers\\"; British Jews caused Germanophobia in Britain; Jews around the world would \\"move heaven and earth\\" to cause an Anglo-German war and \\"Jews, Communists and the intelligentsia\\" were the chief troublemakers in the world. To counter the negative reaction caused in Britain by the Kristallnacht pogrom, Henderson during his stay in London suggested to Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the Court of St James's for the persecution of German Jews to be \\"regularized in an orderly and systematic manner\\" to reduce the offence of British public opinion. When Henderson returned to Berlin on 13 February 1939, his first action was to call a meeting of the senior staff of the British embassy, where he castigated Ogilvie-Forbes for his negative tone in his dispatches during his absence and announced that all dispatches to London would have to conform to his views, and that any diplomat who reported otherwise would be removed from the Foreign Office. On 18 February 1939, Henderson reported to London: \\"Herr Hitler does not contemplate any adventures at the moment... all stories and rumours to the contrary are completely without foundation\\". In February 1939, Henderson cabled the Foreign Office in London: On 6 March 1939, Henderson sent a lengthy dispatch to Lord Halifax that attacked almost everything that Ogilvie-Forbes had written while he was in charge of the British embassy. Besides disallowing Ogilvie-Forbes, Henderson also attacked British newspapers for negative coverage of Nazi Germany, especially the Kristallnacht, and demanded foe the Chamberlain government impose censorship to end all negative coverage of the Third Reich. Henderson wrote: \\"If a free press is allowed to run riot without guidance from higher authority, the damage which it may do is unlimited. Even war may be one of its consequences\\". Henderson praised Hitler for his \\"sentimentality\\" and wrote \\"the humiliation of the Czechs [at the Munich conference] was a tragedy\\", but it was Bene≈°'s own fault for failing to give autonomy to the Sudeten Germans while he still had the chance. Henderson called Kristallnacht a \\"disgusting exhibition\\", which was, however, \\"comprehensible within limits. The German authorities were undoubtedly seriously alarmed lest another Jew, emboldened by the success of Grynszpan should follow his example and murder either Hitler or one of themselves\\". After Wehrmacht troops on 15 to 16 March 1939 occupied the remaining territory of Czechoslovakia in defiance of the Munich Agreement, Chamberlain spoke of a betrayal of confidence and decided to resist German aggression. Henderson handed over a protest note and was intermittently recalled to London. Henderson wrote, \\"Nazism has crossed the Rubicon of the purity of race\\" by creating the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia and that the seizure of the \\"Czech lands\\" of Bohemia and Moravia \\"cannot be justified on any grounds\\". By late March 1939, there was a feeling in the cabinet that Henderson could no longer effectively represent Britain in Berlin, but Henderson was kept on for the want of a suitable \\"grand embassy\\" to send him to as a replacement. There was talk of sending Henderson to Washington, but there were objections that Henderson's tendency to commit \\"calculated indiscretions\\" would not mix well with the American press, which was inclined to report any indiscretions by public figures, whether they were calculated or not. The US State Department made it clear to the Foreign Office that it felt that Henderson would be an embarrassment in Washington. When Henderson asked for leave to visit Canada in the spring of 1939, he was told that he would have to give to the Foreign Office copies of any planned lectures before he gave them since no one in the Chamberlain government still trusted Henderson to \\"speak sensibly\\" about Germany. On 29 April 1939, the French ambassador in Berlin, Robert Coulondre, reported to Paris that when Germany occupied the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939, that Henderson, \\"always an admirer of the National Socialist regime, careful to protect Mr. Hitler's prestige, was convinced that Great Britain and Germany could divide the world between them\\" but was very angry when he learned that the Reich had just violated the Munich Agreement, as it \\"wounded him in his pride\\". Coulondre went on to write: \\"Yesterday, I found him exactly as I knew him in February\\". Coulondre added that Henderson had told him that the German demand for the Free City of Danzig to be allowed to rejoin Germany was justified in his view and that the introduction of conscription in Britain did not mean that British policies towards Germany were changing. Coulondre concluded that \\"it appears that events barely touched Sir Nevile Henderson, like water over a mirror.... It would seem that he forgot everything and failed to learn anything\\". Henderson's relations with Coulondre were unfriendly and cold as the latter distrusted both Henderson and Weizs√§cker, and unlike Fran√ßois-Poncet, Coulondre refused to join the \\"group of four\\" that had met in 1938 to stop a war. By early May 1939, Henderson reported to London that Hitler still wanted good relations with Britain but only it ended \\"the policy of encirclement\\". Henderson also added that he believed in the \\"justice\\" of Hitler's demand for the Free City of Danzig to return to Germany and wrote that Danzig was \\"practically a wholly German city\\" and that Hitler did not want a war with Poland, but one might break out \\"if his offer to Poland was uncompromisingly rejected\\". During the Danzig Crisis, Henderson consistently took the line that Germany was justified in demanding the return of the Free City of Danzig and that the onus was on the Poles to make concessions to Germany by allowing it to \\"go home to the Reich\\". Henderson wrote to Halifax about Danzig and the Polish Corridor: \\"Can we allow the Polish government to be too uncompromising with them?\\" Henderson felt the Versailles had been unjust towards Germany by creating the Free City of Danzig and giving the Polish Corridor and part of Silesia to Poland, and his preferred solution to the crisis would be Britain to pressure the Poles into concessions. However, Henderson also believed that Britain needed to deter Germany from attacking Poland while Britain pressured Poland into concessions and so favoured the \\"peace front\\" with the Soviet Union, despite his distrust, as the best form of deterrence. On the eve of the Second World War, Henderson came into frequent conflict with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Henderson argued that Britain should rearm secretly, as public rearmimg would encourage the belief that Britain planned to go to war against Germany. Cadogan and the Foreign Office disagreed with Henderson. The signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 and the Anglo-Polish military alliance two days later made war imminent. On the night of 30 August, Henderson had an extremely-tense meeting with Ribbentrop. Ribbentrop presented the German \\"final offer\\" to Poland at midnight and warned Henderson that if he received no reply by dawn, the \\"final offer\\" would be considered to have been rejected. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described the scene: \\"When Ribbentrop refused to give a copy of the German demands to the British Ambassador at midnight of 30‚Äì31 August 1939, the two almost came to blows. Ambassador Henderson, who had long advocated concessions to Germany, recognised that here was a deliberately conceived alibi the German government had prepared for a war it was determined to start. No wonder Henderson was angry; von Ribbentrop on the other hand could see war ahead and went home beaming\\".A World At Arms by Gerhard Weinberg, p. 43. Henderson leaves for Berlin, Croydon Airport, August 1939 While negotiating with Polish Ambassador J√≥zef Lipski and advising accommodation over Germany's territorial ambitions, as he had during the Anschluss with Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia, Germany staged the Gleiwitz incident, and the invasion of Poland began on 1 September. Henderson had to deliver Britain's final ultimatum on the morning of 3 September 1939 to Ribbentrop that if hostilities between Germany and Poland did not cease by 11 a.m. that day, a state of war would exist between Britain and Germany. Germany did not respond and so Chamberlain declared war at 11:15 a.m. Henderson and his staff were briefly interned by the Gestapo before they returned to Britain on 7 September. Later life Henderson's memorial in St Andrew's Church, Nuthurst, West Sussex After he had returned to London, Henderson asked for another ambassadorship, but was denied. He wrote Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937‚Äì1939, which was published in 1940. He spoke highly of some members of the Nazi regime, including Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring but not Ribbentrop. He had been on friendly terms with members of the Astors' Cliveden set, which also supported appeasement. Henderson wrote in his memoirs how eager Prince Paul of Yugoslavia had been to illustrate his military plans to counter Mussolini's projected assault on Dalmatia when the main body of the Italian Royal Army had been sent overseas.Jukic, Ilija, The Fall of Yugoslavia, New York and London, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1974, pp. 14-15. The historian A. L. Rowse described Failure of a Mission as \\"an appalling revelation of fatuity in high place\\". Death Henderson died on 30 December 1942 of cancer from which he had suffered since 1938. He was then staying at the Dorchester Hotel, in London.Peter Neville: ‚ÄòHenderson, Sir Nevile Meyrick (1882‚Äì1942)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011, accessed 1 Nov 2014 Informed by his doctors that he had around six months left to live, he wrote an anecdote-filled diplomatic memoir, Water Under the Bridges, which was posthumously published in 1945. Its final chapter defends his work in Berlin and the policy of \\"appeasement,\\" praises Chamberlain for being \\"an honest and brave man\\" and argues on behalf of the Munich Agreement on the grounds that Britain was too weak militarily in 1938 to have stood up to Hitler. It also asserts that if Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, the latter would have fallen within a few months.Sir Nevile Henderson, Water Under the Bridges, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1945, p. 5; pp. 209-221. https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.524087/2015.524087.Water- Under#page/n221/mode/2up References = Primary sources =  Secondary sources      External links Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937 ‚Äì 1939 * Category:1882 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia Category:British people of World War II Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Argentina Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Paraguay Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Germany Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:People educated at Eton College ","title":"Nevile Henderson"},{"id":"7719153","text":"Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez (May 6, 1809 - February 26, 1878) was an Argentine statesman, jurist, surveyor, historian, critic, and poet. He was a major figure in Argentine liberalism and one of the most prominent promoters of Argentine culture during the 19th century. His oeuvre includes novels, Costumbrist dramas, biographies, literary criticism, and scientific works. His political career began after the fall of Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1852. He represented Entre R√≠os at the Argentine constitutional convention the following year. Between 1854 and 1856 he served as minister of foreign relations for the Argentine Confederation. Along with Esteban Echeverr√≠a, he was one of the founders of the Asociaci√≥n de Mayo, an intellectual movement of the Rio de la Plata region. Guti√©rrez was also a major figure of science and technology within Argentina. He was rector of the University of Buenos Aires from 1861 until his retirement in 1874. During his tenure, numerous distinguished European professors joined the university's faculty. Along with Hermann Burmeister, he launched the study of natural sciences in Argentina. :\\"Fortunately I have a malleable character and always find as much promise in a book of poetry as in a book of mathematics.\\" - Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez :\\"By virtue of his heart's loftiness and his spirit's luster, Guti√©rrez was a poet without compromising himself as a mathematician. This yields the precious alliance of good taste and good sense that pervades his intelligence.\\" - Juan Bautista Alberdi Biography Guti√©rrez was acquainted with letters from an early age, but did not disdain the sciences, and was especially fond of mathematics. He studied engineering as much as he did law. He earned his doctorate in jurisprudence at age 27 with the thesis Sobre los tres poderes p√∫blicos (\\"On the three public powers\\"). He was exempt from paying tuition due to his family's poor economic standing, but chose to pay his own way as a surveyor and engineer with the Topographical Department, by producing translations, and by contributing to literary journals. He formed and presided over the Association of Historical Studies and regularly attended meetings of the Literary Salon founded by Marcos Sastre. In 1837 he delivered his lecture Physiognomy of Spanish learning. During the rule of Juan Manuel de Rosas, Guti√©rrez's support for Argentine exiles in Montevideo led to his dismissal and imprisonment. He himself moved to Uruguay in 1840 when it was discovered that he had collaborated anonymously to El Iniciador, a periodical critical of Rosas. At the same time he continued to produce works as an engineer and topographer. Along with Juan Bautista Alberdi and Esteban Echeverr√≠a, he founded the Asociaci√≥n de Mayo. In 1843 he and Alberdi traveled through the Americas and Europe. During a sojourn in Valpara√≠so, Chile, Guti√©rrez devoted himself to teaching and writing. Among his works from this period was the critically acclaimed Am√©rica Po√©tica. He became the first director of the Naval Academy in Valpara√≠so. He published biographies translated from the French, as well as the results of his investigations of the new world. The fall of Rosas in 1852 allowed Guti√©rrez to return to Argentina, where he attended the Constitutional Convention of 1853 as a supporter of the San Nicol√°s Agreement. As minister of foreign relations of the Argentine Confederation under Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, he contributed to the success of the San Jos√© de Flores Agreement in 1859, which reunited Buenos Aires and the provinces of the Argentine Confederation. Guti√©rrez began a career as a journalist in Buenos Aires and also served as a national deputy. President Bartolom√© Mitre appointed him rector of the University of Buenos Aires, in which capacity he served from 1861 to 1874.; he established the university's School of Engineering in 1866. He later attended the Constitutional Convention of Buenos Aires between 1870 and 1873.

The story first appeared in the February 1959 issue of Satellite Science Fiction and was reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Plot summary A theoretical physicist and his son work on the theory of time travel, and experiment with a method of reaching back into time and retrieving objects (as also occurs in \\"The Ugly Little Boy\\" and \\"Button, Button\\"). More by serendipity than design, they manage to retrieve a nest of dinosaur eggs which in due course hatch. They keep on working but are unable to repeat the experiment. In the meantime, the dinosaurs grow and are kept as pets. But when one of them accidentally gets electrocuted, they can't resist tasting the flesh beneath the scales and find that it tastes delicious. The two men decide to raise the dinosaurs to be killed for food and open the first of a successful chain of restaurants dedicated to serving \\"dinachicken.\\". The ironic twist of the title is that the physicist is remembered not for his scientific achievements, but for his culinary discovery.

Harris was among the seminal writers of Southern humor, and has been called \\"the most original and gifted of the antebellum humorists.\\"Michael Dunne, Calvinist Humor in American Literature (Louisiana State University Press, 2007), p. 8. His work influenced authors such as Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor. Harris moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, as a child, where he worked variously as a silversmith, riverboat captain, and farmer. His earliest works were political satires published in the Knoxville Argus around 1840, and his earliest attributable works were four sporting stories published in the New York Spirit of the Times in 1843. He wrote his Sut Lovingood tales for various newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s, twenty-four of which he compiled and published as his only book, Sut Lovingood: Yarns Spun By a Nat'ral Born Durn'd Fool, in 1867. Harris died in Knoxville in 1869 after mysteriously falling ill on a train ride. Biography =Early life= The details of Harris's early life are obscure. His father, George Harris, and a companion, Samuel Bell, moved to Pennsylvania in the 1790s. Bell's son, also named Samuel, was born in 1798.Donald Day, \\"The Life of George Washington Harris,\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. 6, No. 1 (March 1947), pp. 3-38. After the elder Bell died, Harris married his widow, Margaret Glover Bell, and they gave birth to George Washington Harris in Allegheny City (now part of Pittsburgh) in 1814. In 1819, Harris's half-brother, the younger Samuel Bell, completed an apprenticeship at an arms factory and moved to Knoxville to open a jewelry store. Harris went with him and was apprenticed at the shop. In 1826, a steamboat known as the Atlas became the first to reach Knoxville from the Mississippi River. Harris built a small model of the Atlas and dazzled an audience by sailing it across the so-called \\"Flag Pond\\" on the north side of town. At age 15, Harris rode horses in \\"quarter races\\" (i.e., races over a quarter of a mile) at tracks in the Knoxville vicinity. In 1835, he was hired as captain of the steamboat Knoxville. As captain of this vessel (later renamed the Indian Chief), Harris took part in the Cherokee removal in 1838. =Early writing career= In 1839, Harris left the steamboat business and purchased a farm near Maryville. Around 1840, he published his first political satires in the Knoxville Argus (later renamed the Standard), a Democratic-leaning newspaper edited by Elbridge Gerry Eastman (1813-1859), with whom Harris would form a lifelong partnership. Since articles in the Argus were typically published under generic pseudonyms, it is not known with certainty which articles Harris wrote. By early 1843, Harris had moved back to Knoxville to operate a metalworking shop. That same year, he published four \\"Sporting Epistles,\\" the earliest known works attributable to him, in the New York Spirit of the Times. In 1845, he published \\"The Knob Dance: A Tennessee Frolic,\\" in response to a Mississippi writer who had derided East Tennessee as bland and overly obsessed with religion. Over the next two years, he wrote several more stories for the Spirit, culminating with, \\"There's Danger In Old Chairs\\" in 1847. In the late 1840s, Harris turned to inventing and claimed to have prepared several articles for Scientific American, but no such articles have been found. Over the subsequent decade, he engaged in various enterprises, which included the founding of a glassworks and the cofounding of a sawmill, both of which apparently failed. He was elected an alderman for Knoxville in 1856 and appointed the city's postmaster the following year. =Later career= Sut Lovingood, as drawn in Harris's 1867 book, Sut Lovingood's Yarns Around 1854, Harris surveyed several copper mines in the Ducktown area in southeast Tennessee. While working in the area, it is believed he met a local farmer, William \\"Sut\\" Miller (d. 1858), who inspired his best-known character, Sut Lovingood. In November 1854, Harris published his first Sut Lovingood tale, \\"Sut Lovingood's Daddy, Acting Horse,\\" which would also be his last entry in the Spirit of the Times. For the remainder of the decade, his preferred outlet was the Nashville Union and American, edited by his old friend, Elbridge G. Eastman. As the rift between the North and South widened in the years leading up the Civil War, Harris, an ardent Democrat and secessionist, moved to Nashville and began writing political satires in support of the South. These included his four-part story \\"Love-Feast of Varmints,\\" which lampooned the Opposition Party's March 1859 Nashville convention, and three Sut Lovingood tales in 1861 that attacked President Abraham Lincoln. In early 1862, Harris fled Nashville ahead of invading Union forces and spent the remainder of the war evading the Union Army. After the war, Harris, with the help of future Chattanooga congressman William Crutchfield, was appointed president of the Wills Valley Railroad (which operated in Georgia and Alabama). In 1866, he published \\"Sut Lovingood Come to Life,\\" an attack on the Radical Republicans. The following year, he published his only book-length work, Sut Lovingood: Yarns Spun By a Nat'ral Born Durn'd Fool, which was a collection of twenty-four Sut Lovingood tales, sixteen of which had been published in various newspapers prior to the war. =Death= Following the success of Sut Lovingood Yarns, Harris made plans to publish a new collection of stories entitled High Times and Hard Times.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 46-7. In late November 1869, he travelled from his new home in Alabama to Lynchburg, Virginia, to show his manuscript to a prospective publisher. On December 11, while riding the train back to Alabama, Harris fell gravely ill somewhere near Bristol, Tennessee. When the train stopped in Knoxville, Harris, unconscious, was taken to the Atkin Hotel, which stood on North Gay Street. At the Atkin, Harris was examined by a doctor, who issued a preliminary diagnosis of apoplexy. Later in the evening, four other doctors arrived, including Harris's brother-in-law, John Fouche. These doctors rejected the initial diagnosis and suggested a possible morphine overdose. Around 10:00 PM, Harris briefly regained consciousness and managed to say one final word: \\"poisoned\\". He died shortly afterward, with the official cause listed as \\"unknown.\\" No copy of his manuscript High Times and Hard Times has ever been found. Writing =Early writings= Harris's earliest attributable works in the Spirit of the Times were four letters, or \\"epistles,\\" to the Spirit's editor, William T. Porter. The first of these, entitled \\"Sporting Epistle from East Tennessee,\\" was an account of a raccoon hunt in which the hunters mistook a bulge in a tree for a raccoon.George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"Sporting Epistle from East Tennessee\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 16-18. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 11 February 1843. The second involves a mountaineer who travels several miles to watch a quarter-race in south Knox County but misses the race due to drinking.George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"Quarter Racing in Tennessee\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 19-22. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 15 April 1843. The third epistle is a collection of anecdotes and observations, and mentions a 100-pound fish caught at Forks-of-the-River in east Knox County.George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"Sporting Epistle from East Tennessee\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 23-27. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 17 June 1843.

Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"Sporting Epistle from East Tennessee\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 28-31. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 2 September 1843. One of Harris's earliest successes was \\"A Snake-Bit Irishman,\\" which appeared in the Spirit of the Times in 1846. The story involves several hunters in Morgan County who play a prank on an Irishman who had invited himself into their camp. The story relies on Irish stereotypes common at the time.George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"A Snake-Bit Irishman\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 54-58. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 17 January 1846.Ormonde Plater, \\"Before Sut: Folklore in the Early Works of George Washington Harris\\". Southern Folklore Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 2 (June 1970), pp. 104-115. In \\"A Sleep- Walking Incident,\\" also published in 1846, Harris claimed to have once spent the night with a farm family in northeastern Tennessee, during which he sleep- walked his way into bed with the farmers' daughters. While the enraged farmer threatened to shoot Harris, he allowed him a brief headstart on his horse, and Harris managed to escape.George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), \\"A Sleep-Walking Incident\\". High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 59-66. Originally published in the Spirit of the Times, 12 September 1846. =Sut Lovingood= Women attack a \\"hard-shell preacher\\" who tries to break up a dance in Harris's \\"Bart Davis's Dance\\" Sut Lovingood, Harris's best-known figure, is a caricature of a stereotypical farmer of rural Southern Appalachia. Knoxville historian Jack Neely describes Sut as \\"Huck Finn on amphetamines, a manic, perverse child of some backwoods holler where Idiocy and Genius fuse into one.\\" Sut considers himself (somewhat proudly) to be a \\"durnder fool\\" than anyone, save his own father.George Washington Harris, Sut Lovingood: Yarns Spun By a Nat'ral Born Durn'd Fool (New York: Dick and Fitzgerald, 1867), pp. 21, 30, 67, 129, e.g. He is fond of drinking whiskey and chasing girls, and relishes exposing hypocritical circuit riders and other religious figures and politicians.David Estes, \\"Sut Lovingood at the Camp Meeting: A Practical Joker Among the Backwoods Believers,\\" Southern Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Winter 1987), pp. 53-65. Revenge pranks are a common theme in the Sut Lovingood tales. In \\"Parson John Bullen's Lizards,\\" for instance, Parson Bullen, a fire-and-brimstone preacher, beats Sut with a club after catching him in the bushes with a girl at a camp meeting. Later, when Bullen is preaching to a large crowd, Sut releases several lizards, which crawl up Bullen's legs, prompting him to strip off his clothes in terror. Another target of Sut's revenge is Sicily Burns, a mountain woman who tricks Sut into drinking baking soda. In response, Sut causes a bull to wreak havoc at Sicily's wedding.George Washington Harris, Sut Lovingood: Yarns Spun By a Nat'ral Born Durn'd Fool (New York: Dick and Fitzgerald, 1867), pp. 75-98. Sut's dialect is an exaggerated version of the South Midland dialect, commonly called \\"Appalachian English\\". Appalachian characteristics that frequently occur in Sut's speech include r-intrusion (e.g., \\"orter\\" for \\"ought to\\"), h-retention (e.g., \\"hit\\" instead of \\"it\\"), short \\"e\\" pronounced as short \\"o\\" (e.g., \\"whar\\" for \\"where\\"), and trailing t-intrusion (e.g., \\"onct\\" for \\"once\\").Carol Boykin, \\"Sut's Speech: Dialect of a 'Nat'ral Borned' Mountaineer.\\" The Lovingood Papers (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1965), pp. 36-42. =Political satires= Harris was a strong Democrat, and his political writings either extolled Democratic leaders or lampooned leaders of opposing parties, namely the Whigs and Republicans.Donald Day, \\"The Political Satires of George W. Harris,\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 4 (December 1945), pp. 320-338. In his 1856 story, \\"Playing Old Sledge For the Presidency,\\" Harris has Sut Lovingood recount a dream in which presidential candidates James Buchanan, Millard Fillmore, and John C. Fr√©mont play a card game for the presidency. Harris's 1859 story \\"Love-Feast of Varmints\\" mocked the Opposition Party's state convention using anthropomorphic animals to portray party leaders such as John Bell, Henry S. Foote and Neill S. Brown.Leroy Graf, \\"Sut Lovingood's Love-Feast of Varmints Held at Nashville March 28 and 29,\\" The Lovingood Papers (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1963), pp. 13-19. In 1861, Harris published his three-part attack on Abraham Lincoln entitled \\"Sut Lovingood Travels With Old Abe as His Confidential Friend and Advisor.\\" His first writings after the Civil War included \\"Sut Lovingood's Dream\\" and \\"On the Puritan Yankee,\\" which defended Southern values. In 1868, Harris published \\"The Forthcoming Early Life of Sut Lovingood, By His Dad,\\" which was a response to \\"The Early Life of Grant, By His Father,\\" which had appeared in the New York Ledger earlier that year. One of Harris's last political stories, entitled \\"Well! Dad's Dead,\\" was an allegory bemoaning the decline of the Southern way of life. Influence and legacy Authors Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor all acknowledged inspiration from George Washington Harris's work. In 1867, Mark Twain wrote a review of Sut Lovingood's Yarns for a San Francisco newspaper in which he suggested the book would \\"sell well in the west, but the eastern people will call it course and possibly taboo it.\\"Henning Cohen, \\"Mark Twain's Sut Lovingood,\\" The Lovingood Papers (Athens, Tenn.: The Sut Society, 1962), pp. 19-24. Faulkner read the Sut Lovingood yarns with \\"amused appreciation,\\"Robert Hamblin and Charles Peek (eds.), A William Faulkner Encyclopedia (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1999), p 189. and O'Connor ranked him among the top American \\"grotesque\\" writers.Milton Rickels, George Washington Harris (Twayne Publishers, 1966), p. 131.

The mid-20th century brought revived interest in Harris's work. Literary historians compiled biographical materials regarding Harris's life, and scoured old newspapers to find and catalog Harris's work. In 1967, Thomas Inge published a collection of Harris's known works that did not appear in Sut Lovingood's Yarns in 1867. The book was entitled, High Times and Hard Times, after Harris's lost manuscript.M. Thomas Inge, High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 3-5. In 2008, George Washington Harris's final resting place was discovered in Brock Cemetery, Wildwood, Georgia. The literary/detective team was a group of scholars and writers from several states including Calhoun Community College faculty members located in Decatur, Alabama; a local historian from Decatur; and a writer based in Georgia. On April 20, 2008, a monument in his honor was erected at his burial site by Sigma Kappa Delta, an honor society for students studying English at two-year colleges.Deangelo McDaniel, \\"Calhoun Group Plans Marker for Author\\".

Thillens' idea was to have a baseball park that anyone can use, rent-free. It cost Thillens a total of $6 million to build the park. In 1940 the ballpark erected lights for night use. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s both Little League games and men's 16-inch softball games were televised from the park by WGN-TV, with Jack Brickhouse announcing. It was during a Little League telecast in the 1950s that the centerfield camera, now a staple of all baseball telecasts, was first used. According to Brickhouse, \\"One of our cameramen, Chuck Seatsema, told me that the center- field scoreboard was only a couple hundred feet away. He had a feeling that if he put a camera out there, we'd get a nice shot of the little catcher giving signs and the little batter's face over the pitcher's shoulder.\\" The centerfield scoreboard contained a picture of the Thillens armored truck. Starting in 1974, if any player hit the sign, they would win a $5,000 savings bond. In 1993, Mel Thillens, Sr. died, but his family continued to operate the field and a non-profit charitable foundation supported it. Over time, the foundation could not afford expenses and, in March 2005, Thillens Stadium closed. The city of Chicago and the Chicago Cubs combined to invest $1.5 million in repairs and the stadium reopened its doors in June 2006.Fran Spielman, \\"Ball drops at iconic stadium,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, June 21, 2013. The park has since been renamed The Stadium at Devon and Kedzie. An area landmark was the giant baseball with the name Thillens on a large pole in the front of the ballpark on Devon Avenue. The ball was moved from Boys World, a clothing store on Devon that closed in the 1950s. Originally, the ball spun on the pole. Several years after the Chicago Park District took over the field the Thillens family requested that their family name be removed from the field. Mel Thillens, Jr. was quoted as saying the field wasn't being maintained and the Thillens family and business no longer wanted to be associated with it. The Chicago Park District claims to have maintained Thillens so it can ‚Äúcontinue as a place of historical significance‚Äù that ‚Äúthousands of children enjoy‚Äù each year. They obliged Mr. Thillens' request, removing the name from the field. At about the same time, the 60+ year-old giant baseball was removed, as it was deemed unsafe. Events The annual Chicago Celebrity Softball games are hosted at Thillens Stadium. Those games have featured Michael Jordan, Chris Chelios, Minnie Mi√±oso, Rich Melman, Ferguson Jenkins, Randy Hundley, Billy Williams and Moose Skowron. On July 28, 2009, the Chicago Bandits played the USSSA Pride in a National Pro Fastpitch women's softball game.

The building was completed in 1926 and is now recognized as one of the most important works by architect Rudolf Schindler, second only to the Schindler House, built four years earlier for his family as a show house and studio. Both of these early houses by Schindler are considered landmarks of early modern architecture in America.Other works by RMS MAK Center for Art and Architecture at the Schindler House The residence is on the ocean front, not far from The Wedge at Newport Harbor, in a tightly packed neighborhood of buildings. The house is sheltered from the street on the west side by raising the living quarters above the ground level. The open space below reveals the reinforced concrete frames that were formed in the shape of a figure 8. Two stairways pass through the openings in the frames leading to the kitchen and the main entry. The garage is on the north side of the ground floor and the garden is on the south side, between the house and the beach. The interior is arranged around a two-story living/dining room, with full height, curtain wall windows on the east and south side facing the ocean. The kitchen and breakfast area are located on the north side of the first floor, with a terrace on the ocean side over the garden. Lamps and built-in furniture were provided as part of the original design. Bedrooms on the second floor are connected by a corridor overlooking the main living room. Each of the bedrooms originally had access to an open sleeping porch, but these were enclosed by Schindler in 1928. Context The client for the project, Philip M. Lovell, was inspired by a style of healthy living, with guidelines for proper diet and exercise. Schindler also adopted these principles and addressed these concerns in the design of the beach house.Schindler House/Studio MAK Center: Schindler House The arrangement of the living quarters on the north side of the house maximizes the circulation of fresh air. Each bedroom is furnished with windows for cross ventilation to eliminate the need for air conditioning. Lovell also commissioned another house in Los Angeles. The Lovell \\"Health House\\" was completed in 1929 on Dundee Drive in Los Angeles, three years after the Beach House was finished. This commission was awarded to Richard Neutra, who was living with his wife in a part of Schindler's House and studio between 1926 and 1930. These two architects created houses that became classic forms of the new California residential design, and icons of the Modern movement in America. Historic significance The Los Angeles branch of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) documented the house in 1968. The house today has much the same appearance as the photographs taken during the survey. The significance of the house was already apparent at the time: > The Lovell Beach House is generally considered one of the greatest works of > pioneering modern architect, R. M. Schindler. It demonstrates an early use > of concrete which predates and predicts the post-war Brutalist style, in > which concrete is left unsurfaced, and structure is distinct from enclosure. > ... The house is lifted above its beach site and cradled in five concrete > frames in the shape of figure 8's. These were poured in place. The enclosed > areas were shop-fabricated and hoisted into position. The play of forms in > the advancing and receding planes are related to the De Stijl movement begun > in the Netherlands in 1917.

The trans-Atlantic shipping competition between Collins and UK shipping magnate Samuel Cunard as caricatured by Frank Bellew in 1852 Early life He was born on August 5, 1802 in Truro, Massachusetts to Israel Gross Collins (1776‚Äì1831) and Mary Ann Knight (c.1780-c.1802). His mother was a niece of Sir Edward Knight and she died shortly after Edward was born. His aunts then raised him. His father moved to New York City. At age thirteen in 1815, Collins left Truro for New Jersey to attend school. He then went to New York City as an apprentice clerk in the counting house of McCrea and Slidell. Within a few years, Edward moved to Delaplaine and Company. Shipping career In 1821 he joined his father's company and in January 1824 he became a partner in I. G. Collins & Son. In 1827 they started the first regularly scheduled packet service between New York City and Veracruz, Mexico. In 1826, Collins married Mary Ann Woodruff, the daughter of Thomas T. Woodruff. They had a son, Edward K. Collins II, as well as a daughter and at least one other child. After his father's death in 1831 he became involved with the cotton trade between New Orleans and New York. He bought his first shipping line in 1831. In 1836, he launched the Dramatic Line of sailing packets, which quickly became a major presence on what was then the world‚Äôs most important shipping route, between New York and Liverpool. He received a government subsidy in 1847 to carry mail on that same route, for which purpose he formed the New York and Liverpool United States Mail Steamship Company (the \\"Collins Line\\") to compete with Britain's Cunard Line. The new Line‚Äôs inaugural voyage took place in April 1850, and for the next six years its steamships were the biggest, fastest and most luxurious on the Atlantic. They were hugely expensive to operate, however, and in 1852 Collins was forced to go back to Congress to secure a major increase in his subsidy for carrying mail. This left him in a very vulnerable position when the increase was canceled in 1856 after two of the Line's four steamships sank: the Arctic had sunk in 1854 while carrying his wife and two of his children., and less than two years later the Pacific disappeared without a trace on her way back from Liverpool to New York. The Collins Line struggled on for another couple of years, using the insurance payouts for its two lost ships to build an even bigger steamer called the Adriatic. But after its subsidy was reduced it simply could not make ends meet, and in February 1858 the Line finally folded. Later life Collins moved to his summer home, \\"Collinwood\\" in Wellsville, Ohio, where he engaged in coal mining and oil drilling. He remarried, to Sarah Browne, and by 1862 he had moved back to New York City, where he died on January 22, 1878. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.

(see list) Cable in the Classroom was an American division of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association that assisted the cable television industry in providing educational content to schools. The organization was founded in 1989. A Canadian organization, also called \\"Cable in the Classroom\\" (\\"La c√¢blo-√©ducation\\" in French), was founded in 1995, and held the same scope as the US organization. Cable stations broadcast educational television programs at specific times (usually early in the morning) commercial-free and notified Cable in the Classroom as to when the shows would air, which maintained a master list for educators to reference. This way, educators were able to record the programs for free and use them in school as learning tools for children. Copyrights were cleared so that educators could use the content of the listed programs as they wished for their syllabi and learning plans. Over the years however, many networks discontinued any effort at promoting Cable in the Classroom or setting aside programming for the organization's purposes, ceding more to direct marketing of their educational television programming to teachers and school districts via their home video departments, their Internet sites, or in the cases of networks such as ABC Family, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network, removing their involvement altogether, commensurate with the Internet ending other cable services tied to traditional scheduling such as \\"near video on demand\\". Another factor was likely the decline in VHS recorders, as DVRs with non- portable storage became the recording format of choice over DVD recorders, the equivalent successor to VCRs. Streaming video also played a factor in the reduction of Cable in the Classroom, as educators can now access and play content at any time via computers connected to in-classroom televisions and video projectors rather than on a set schedule. In 2014, Cable in the Classroom was entirely discontinued in the United States with CNN Student News the only program left under the effort, and the NCTA redirected the former Cable in the Classroom portal to promote their \\"Cable Impacts Foundation\\" charity arm instead. The Canadian effort ended as vertically integrated cable and satellite providers purchased networks and campaigned successfully for the CRTC to relax Canadian content restrictions that defined them to schedule programming in a certain manner, including educational programming.

The game runs on Amstrad CPC, MSX and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Overview The hero of the game is Carlin, a naked man who has been mugged and stripped, and needs to find all of his clothes. Carlin is in a town on the planet Zuggi, which resembles a town in Earth in many ways, with locations including an hotel, a cafe, a supermarket and a chemist's shop. As Streaker finds more clothes, he is able to enter more and more locations. The game is won when he is fully dressed. The game is an arcade adventure, somewhere between a puzzle-based adventure game and an action game. Gameplay is controlled through a nested menu system, as in Mastertronic's Spellbound. There are a multitude of items in the game, many of which can be used and some of which seem to have no purpose. Streaker can pick up keys to open doors, eat food items to raise his hunger levels, and needs to solve a number of simple puzzles. Game setting While most aspects of life on Zuggi are very similar to Earth, there are a number of fantastic elements in the world. For example, Streaker may teleport (\\"beam transfer\\") by using a number of different coloured beamers. These will teleport Streaker to the location of the corresponding beampad. These beampads can be moved by Streaker and are a good way to avoid thieves. Nice touches include Streaker's ability to advance time by acquiring a stopwatch (the game is played in real time, and you often need to wait for a particular location to open) and the \\"Save\\" and \\"Load\\" options appearing after Streaker picks up a Tape Recorder. In-game characters An in-game screenshot Streaker's quest is made more difficult by the presence of a number of thieves. They will steal Streaker's clothes on contact, or cause him to lose a life if he is naked. The clothes may be regained from the thieves by finding and offering the thief an item that he wants.

It features adolescent orphan twins who are \\"trouble\\" and an eccentric older couple who adopt them and take them back to live in \\"magical\\" Ruby Holler (hollow). Creech won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognizing the year's best children's book published in the U.K. (Bloomsbury Children's Books). In a retrospective citation, the librarians call it \\"a beautifully written story about love and trust and how the strength and goodness of human beings can overcome all the odds\\". Creech was the first American winner of the British award and the first person to win both the American Newbery Medal (Walk Two Moons, 1994) and the British Carnegie. Plot The story starts in the Boxton Creek Home, an 'orphanage' run by the Trepids - a strict and dishonest husband and wife. An imaginative thirteen-year-old boy named Dallas and his sassy and bold twin sister Florida have been living in the Home for a long time, often punished for breaking rules that the Trepids post all over the house. Over the years, the twins have been adopted many times and quickly returned to the Home. Because of this, they have been named the \\"trouble twins.\\" They have a plan to run away and take a train to a destination far from Boxton. Outside of Boxton, on a plot of land called Ruby Holler, Tiller and Sairy Morey, a very old couple whose children have grown up and moved away, are discussing their plans for a new adventure. The two decide to foster children, and they adopt Dallas and Florida. Although Sairy, a very kind and trusting old lady, is excited about having children at Ruby Holler again, Tiller - a \\"crotchety old boot\\" - is doubtful. The twins enjoy the freedom and adventure they find in the holler, but they're still suspicious and think that Tiller and Sairy will mistreat them the way others have - although their suspicions soon prove false. Tiller and Sairy tell Dallas and Florida they have been planning separate trips, and they want the twins to come: Dallas with Sairy to explore an island, and Florida with Tiller on a rafting trip. All four are uneasy about a separation from their life-long partner, but they don't speak about this. Tiller and Sairy use their \\"understone funds,\\" underground savings that they've kept for years, to pay for their travels. Meanwhile, Mr. Trepid hears about the understone funds from Dallas and Florida when they run into each other in Boxton, shopping for trip supplies. Mr. Trepid promises to pay a shady man called Z, who is a neighbor of Tiller and Sairy, to map out Ruby Holler. He doesn't say why he needs a map and Z feels uneasy because he likes Tiller and Sairy. He slowly begins the map while also helping the Ruby Holler family prepare for their trips. Dallas and Florida, however, still think that Tiller and Sairy are trouble and they decide to take some supplies and equipment and run away. They don't get far from the cabin. Sairy and Tiller \\"find\\" them camping out, and tell the twins it was a good idea to test the supplies and equipment. They suggest taking practice trips together, closer to home. While on their practice trips, Tiller and Sairy learn about the twins' past and realize that the Trepids are not trustworthy people. The four start out on their trips to the river and the island. Z continues to stall with production of Mr. Trepid's map, feeling more protective of the kids since he believes that Dallas and Florida may really be his biological children: he sees their birth certificate and it looks as if their mother was Z's runaway wife. Eventually he gives Mr. Trepid a map that shows possible hiding places, but Z has removed the understone funds to protect them from Mr. Trepid. On Tiller and Florida's small trip while rafting down a river, their boat capsizes and Tiller suffers a heart attack. Luckily, Dallas, Sairy, and Z find them in time and Tiller is taken to a hospital where he recovers. Z bonds with the twins and they set up traps for Mr. Trepid who looks for the understone funds but fails to find them. In the end, two of Tiller and Sairy's biological children visit the Holler to check on Tiller's health and suggest that the twins go back to the Boxton Creek Home. Dallas and Florida hear their conversation and run away again before hearing Tiller and Sairy's denial. In the morning, Dallas and Florida smell their breakfast cooking as usual and return home to the cabin in Ruby Holler. Characters Dallas: Dallas is one of the protagonists of the novel. He is thirteen years old and was abandoned by his mother as an infant and lived at the Boxton Creek Home for his whole life, except when he was adopted and sent back by families that saw him and his sister as trouble. He is very imaginative and silent, often letting Florida speak for them both. He often thinks situations will turn out for the best, although he is often proven wrong. When a resident of the Boxton Creek Home was dying, Mr. Trepid told Dallas to save him, but he fails and the child dies. He somewhat admires Z and is close friends with Sairy. Florida: Florida is Dallas's twin sister. Like him, she was abandoned to the orphanage at a young age and was sent to many homes with Dallas and then returned, and the two are very close to each other. She is very bold and outspoken, and very hateful of almost everything. She often thinks that she and Dallas can take care of themselves, although she does sometimes show care for others. When Florida first enters Ruby Holler, she is very suspicious of Tiller and Sairy, thinking they will be like other families before. She does not know how to swim, which is unfortunate when she falls out of the boat on a rafting trip, although she knows basic CPR, which she uses to revive Tiller after his heart attack. Sairy: Sairy is an old woman who lives in Ruby Holler with her husband. She is very kind and compassionate, especially with children. She also is very trusting. Her dream is to have another adventure before she dies. She once lived in New York City, and Tiller wrote to her every week from Ruby Holler. Eventually she left the city and married Tiller. She has four children that are adults and have left Ruby Holler. Tiller: Tiller is Sairy's cranky husband. He is about her age and, unlike her, is distrusting and doubtful, much like Florida. He was born on a houseboat and then lived in Ruby Holler all his life. When all his children left, he planted a tree in their memory, but it is accidentally chopped down by Dallas and Florida. His plan is to build a boat with Florida and take a rafting trip down a river. During the trip, the boat falls over in rough waters and he suffers a heart attack, although he eventually recovers. Z: Z (whose full name is never revealed) is Tiller and Sairy's neighbor. He's described as a shady figure who helps Mr. Trepid find the understone funds in exchange for a large amount of money. He is not very responsible, but he easily learns helpful information. He helps the Ruby Holler family prepare for their trips, during which he learns that Dallas and Florida are his children when he sees Dallas's birth certificate and sees his ex-wife's name listed as his mother. He is very good friends with Tiller and Sairy and helpful to them. Mr Trepid: Mr. Trepid co-runs the Boxton Creek Home with his wife and assistant. He is very strict, posting rules in every room of the house and punishing the children who break the rules with chores or time in the basement \\"thinking corner.\\" He is also greedy, dreaming of expensive luxuries and an easy life. When he hears about Tiller and Sairy's understone funds, he hires Z to help him find the money. Mrs Trepid: Mrs. Trepid is Mr. Trepid's wife, who also runs the orphanage. Like her husband, she is strict with children and dreams about an easier life. She often claims to suffer from constant migraines and is suspicious of her husband's actions to earn more money. Reception In a contemporary review for The Guardian, Philip Pullman remarked on Ruby Holler's \\"larger-than-life, brighter-than- natural quality\\" and concluded that while neither great literature nor the author's best work, \\"it's a book that shows how very satisfying unobtrusive craftsmanship can be, even working with slight materials, and it's fun, and it celebrates kindness and decency.\\" Regarding the main plot line, he observed that \\"it's not hard to predict that there will be problems to overcome and dangers to face, but that they'll all live happily ever after.\\" Creech makes it work for all kinds of readers by \\"a complete certainty of tone\\" and by \\"putting the camera in the right place\\". In particular, and unusually for a children's book, she \\"distributes her attention equally among the adults and the children. She looks at whatever is interesting, whatever moves the story forward, and tells us what she sees, and never tells us more than we need.\\" \\"Satisfyingly scary monsters\\". Philip Pullman. The Guardian, July 5, 2002. Retrieved 2012-10-07. Creech traveled to London for five days in July 2003 to receive the Carnegie Medal. Concluding online coverage for The Guardian, Dina Rabinovitch called Ruby Holler \\"an old-fashioned tale of two children in peril rescued by the wisdom of two old folk. What sets it apart is Creech's typical lightness of touch; the glancing way she writes means you barely realise that, even in this solid love story of older folk, the wife is less sure of marriage than the man.\\" \\"Author of the month: Sharon Creech\\".

Career Robert Cawdrey did not attend university, but became a school teacher in Oakham, Rutland, in 1563. In 1565, Cawdrey was ordained deacon and priest in 1570, and on 22 October 1571, he was made rector of South Luffenham in Rutland. However, Cawdrey was sympathetic to Puritan teachings, and got in trouble with the Church authorities. In 1576 he was chastised for not reading the approved texts in his sermons, and in 1578 he performed a marriage even though he was not authorized to do so, and was briefly suspended. His suspension lasted only a few months but, in 1586, he was again in trouble for violating the rules and was called before his bishop, Richard Howland. He had powerful friends, among them his patron Lord Burghley, who tried to defend him, but he was deprived of his rectory in 1588 and had to return to teaching to support himself. Writing With the assistance of his son Thomas Cawdrey (1575‚Äì1640), who was a school teacher in London, Robert Cawdrey decided to create an instructional text; the Table Alphabeticall, which appeared in 1604 when Cawdrey was living in Coventry. As many new words were entering the English language in the 16th century, Cawdrey became concerned that people would become confused. Cawdrey worried that the wealthy were adopting foreign words and phrases, and wrote that \\"they forget altogether their mothers language, so that if some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to tell or understand what they say.\\" He also described how \\"far journied gentlemen\\" learn new words while in foreign lands, and then \\"pouder their talke with over-sea language.\\" Thomas Cawdrey worked on improvements to the Table Alphabeticall. While he was a rector, Robert Cawdrey wrote A Short and Fruitefull Treatise of the Profit of Catechising in 1580. He revised this work and published a second edition in 1604. Cawdrey also published A Treasurie or Store-House of Similes in 1600, and again in 1609. A Table Alphabeticall The full name of his famous dictionary is His dictionary contained about 2,500 words. He was careful to explain the alphabetical order to his readers, which even the most literate of his readers would not know or expect; \\"Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with (a) then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the end.\\" Cawdrey dedicated the Table Alphabeticall to five daughters of Lucy Sidney, Lady Harington; Sarah, Lady Hastings, Theodosia, Lady Dudley, Elizabeth, Lady Montagu, Frances, Lady Leigh, and Mary, Lady Wingfield.Rebecca Shapiro, Fixing Babel: An Historical Anthology of Applied English Lexicography (Lewisburg, 2017), pp. 8, 10. Life Robert Cawdrey had many sons. His youngest son Daniel Cawdrey (ca. 1588-1664) was a Puritan minister.

The district includes the towns of Huntley, Worden, Ballantine, and Pompeys Pillar. Since the Huntley Project was established, the district's main cash crops have been sugar beets and alfalfa. Silage for the local cattle industry is also important. History Bison-hunting Plains Indians, especially the Cheyenne, Crow, and Sioux, frequented this region south of the Yellowstone River from the 17th century. William Clark passed through in July 1806 with members of the Corps of Discovery and inscribed his name on Pompey's Rock. The Yellowstone River provided a route into this sagebrush-covered country for white fur trappers, hunters, and settlers. The U.S. Army made war on the Indian tribes over several decades, and the famous Battle of Little Bighorn took place nearby in June 1876. The district that now includes the Huntley Project was designated as part of the Crow Indian Reservation under a treaty ratified on May 7, 1868. This preserved the area from occupation by white homesteads and cattle ranches, but by 1880 the virtual extinction of the bison made the traditional Crow economy impossible to sustain. By 1895 Crow farmers successfully irrigated and farmed part of the reservation, which had been considered an arid wasteland. In 1882 the city of Billings, linked to the Northern Pacific Railroad, was founded within a few miles of the Crow reservation. In 1904 the United States government obtained the northern part of the reservation by cession from the Crow Indians. Congress authorized the Reclamation Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior to survey the land for a possible irrigation project. The Huntley Project, the fifth federal project to convert arid western land to farmland, was authorized in April 1905, and construction began in October. Despite cost overruns and unforeseen problems, the Pryor Division of the project, including Worden and Ballantine, was completed and receiving water by 1907. The project took its name from the town of Huntley, a station on the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1907 the new Huntley Project townsites of Worden, Ballantine, and Pompeys Pillar were laid out at intervals of about six miles along the railroad. On May 21, 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Pryor Division to be open for settlement. Farm units were distributed by lottery, but the pace of settlement may have been slowed by \\"lottery fanatics\\" from nearby Billings who drew numbers out of idle curiosity, with no intention of settling on the land. Of the first 1,000 names drawn, only 76 applied for a farm unit. The population of Huntley Project farms rose to 2,107 in 1917, but fell again to a probable low of 1,015 in 1923. Much of the irrigation infrastructure of the Huntley Project had been poorly designed and cheaply built, and replacements were soon needed. Growing demand for water required more irrigation canals and an auxiliary pumping station, and by 1913 problems with inadequate drainage had caused hundreds of acres of arid land to become waterlogged. Settlers found that alkali in the soil made it difficult to profitably farm the area, and many farms failed in the recession following World War I. Poor crop yields made it difficult for farmers to pay their portion of the district's costs, so Reclamation refused to fund needed improvements. Tensions between Reclamation and the district farmers peaked during the 1920s, until on January 2, 1927 the two sides settled their dispute with a new contract. Low water and dry weather in the 1930s led to the construction of the first retention dam, then a concrete weir in 1934. The Anita Dam and Reservoir project, about six miles southeast of Ballantine, was completed in 1937 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers.

The , right-hander was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent before the season. He went 34-34 with a 4.07 earned run average in four seasons in their farm system when he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles on January 31, . The White Sox had sent Larry Doby, Jack Harshman and Jim Marshall to the Orioles for Billy Goodman, Tito Francona and Ray Moore on December 3, . When it was discovered by the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ordered the Chisox to send either $20,000 or an acceptable player to the Orioles. Heman was sent to Baltimore to complete this deal. Heman went 9-12 with a 3.20 ERA for Baltimore's triple A affiliate, the Vancouver Mounties in 1958. After the season, he was dealt to the Cleveland Indians for Bobby √Åvila. This trade also ran into some complications when Avila retired from baseball just after the deal. Eventually, the deal was worked out, and Heman went 6-12 with a 4.26 ERA for the Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres in . One of those six wins was a no-hitter against the Mounties. After one more seasons in the minors, he made the big league club out of Spring training . His major league debut came in the sixth game of the season on April 20, against the Detroit Tigers at Cleveland Stadium. He pitched two innings, and gave up three earned runs in the 11-4 Indians loss. He struck out one batter, pitcher Frank Lary. From there, he settled down, earning his only big league save in his next appearance three days later against the Kansas City Athletics at Municipal Stadium. He only allowed one earned run over the remaining eight innings he pitched for the Tribe. He was sold to the Los Angeles Angels on June 5 in order to make room on the roster for Dick Stigman, who was returning from the disabled list. He made six appearances in just over two weeks with the club, giving up three runs (two earned) in ten innings pitched. On June 22, he and shortstop Ken Hamlin were sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for second baseman Billy Moran. Heman finished out the season with Toronto, and pitched two more seasons in the minors before calling it a career. Season and career totals include twelve games pitched, all in relief, a 0-0 record and one save. In twenty innings, he allowed twelve hits and 10 walks for a very low WHIP of 1.100.

It was recorded after his collaboration with Michael Bloomfield and Stephen Stills on the 1968 album Super Session. Background After ten years of session playing, collaborations and playing in other bands, Kooper released his first solo album in February, 1969. It is an eclectic mix of country, soul, blues, and rock with a dose of psychedelia mixed throughout. It is a continuation of Super Session in its mix of disparate covers from the likes of Bill Monroe, Harry Nilsson and Traffic, and with originals running the gamut of feelings. Unlike the Super Session album, however, the spotlight is on Kooper alone and Kooper's alternate utilization of orchestras and professional Nashville studio musicians; the tracks are far more focused, all within two and five minutes. \\"Camille\\" is lifted from \\"Overture to Le Domino Noire\\" by French composer Daniel Auber. Most tracks are bridged with sound effects taken from albums issued by Elektra Records. The Overture begins with a collage of sound effects also taken from those albums. While it seems distracting now, it is a product of the era that it was recorded in. The album was on the Billboard 200 charts for 13 weeks, peaking at #54 on March 15, 1969.

Originally designed to carry ore, the ship was converted into an automobile carrier in 1925. She was trapped in ice on Lake Superior November 30, 1926, and after multiple salvage attempts, Bangor was declared a total loss. Shipwreck City of Bangor was captained by William J. Mackin. On the night of November 30, 1926, Bangor was carrying 248 new Chrysler automobiles from Detroit, Michigan to Duluth, Minnesota, when a severe storm drove her onto the rocks of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Eighteen cars that were spiked to the deck of the ship slipped overboard and were lost. During the same storm, Thomas Maytham, which was carrying 20,000 tons of grain from Duluth to Toledo, Ohio, went aground on the other side of the peninsula. Rescue The next morning, after the winds had subsided, Bangors crew managed to free the lifeboats, and by afternoon all the men had made it ashore. They began to walk to the nearest village, Copper Harbor, which was about 15 miles away, but became lost in the unfamiliar territory. They spent the night with a fire but no shelter, inadequate clothing, and no food. The next day, a United States Coast Guard rescue lifeboat, out of Eagle Harbor Life Saving Station, came around the point while carrying Thomas Maythams crew, and discovered Bangors crew. The Coast Guard captain dropped off the men from Thomas Maytham at Copper Harbor and returned for the men from City of Bangor. The men were exhausted and suffering from hypothermia; several were hospitalized with frostbite. The majority of the Chryslers were in the hold, separated from the flooded engine room by a strong partition. A visual inspection of the hold showed that the cars were in good condition. When the water around the wrecked ship had frozen solid, an ice ramp was constructed, and the cars were driven off the ship.Billock (2014), p. 90 The area around the Keweenaw Peninsula was heavily forested and buried in about of snow, so the cars were driven along the icy banks of the lake to Copper Harbor. When the roads opened in the spring, the cars were driven to Calumet, Michigan, loaded onto trains, and taken to Detroit for repair and re-sale.Billock (2014), p. 90 City of Bangor herself was a total loss, but 202 of the vehicles were salvaged from the wreck and sold. The City of Bangor wreck site is now part of the Keweenaw Underwater Preserve, established in 1991, along with the nearby wrecks of Altadoc and Scotia, and she can be visited by scuba divers.Billock (2014), p. 89 The only remaining part of the Eagle Harbor Life Saving Station, the boathouse, is now a museum containing shipwreck memorabilia including one of the 1927 Chryslers from City of Bangor.Billock (2014), p. 80 References  Sources  * External links * Maritime History of the Great Lakes: Shipwrecks: City of Bangor Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Maritime incidents in 1926 Category:1896 ships Category:Ships built in Bay City, Michigan ","title":"City of Bangor (ship)"},{"id":"7719562","text":"L√©l√© is a town in southern Cameroon, near the junction of the borders of Cameroon, Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville.

The princess was a professional vertical motorcyclist and secret agent of the Lubyanka. Prince Kirill, in Tashkent province, Soviet Union (now Uzbekistan) in 1919 Early life As the daughter of Prince Romanovsky-Iskander, n√© , and his first wife, Olga Iosifovna Rogowska (b 1893; disappeared in the USSR; d c. 1962, daughter of Iosif Rogowski) Romanovskaya- Iskander was the granddaughter of Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich, the disgraced grandson of Tsar Nicholas I; thus, she was a patrilineal great- great-granddaughter of Nicholas I. Her date of birth is disputed, and has been reported as 10 February 1916, 3 February 1917, or 17 February 1910. Grand Duke Constantine Nicholaevich's son, Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich, was exiled to Central Asia in disgrace for stealing his mother's diamonds. Grand Duke Nicholas established a palace in Tashkent and lived in grand style where he sired a son, whom Tsar Alexander III (his great-uncle) granted the title Prince Iskander (Iskander was the Arabic form of AlexanderBehind the Name). This prince, Alexander Nikolaievich (15 November 1887 N.S. ‚Äì 26 January 1957) who granted the name of Iskander and the rank of a Noble of the Russian Empire by Imperial Ukase 1889 and that of Hereditary Noble by Imperial Ukase 1899, also granted the title of Prince Romanovsky-Iskander with the qualification of Serene Highness by the Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia, who became the grandfather of Princess Natalia in absentia, in 1925, in turn, fathered the Princess Iskander. Alexander Nikolaievich only had issue by his first wife. Natalia Androsova was born in Tashkent, a member of the Constantinovichi branch of the Russian Imperial Family. She had an older brother, Prince Kirill Romanovsky-Iskander (1914‚Äì1992). Her parents, who had been married since 5 May 1912, separated and in 1924 Natalia and her brother moved with their mother to Moscow (first moved to Plyushchikha Street, later to Old Arbat), where Olga remarried to Nicholas Androsov. Natalia's stepfather adopted her and her brother so Princess Iskander was renamed Natalia Nikolaievna Androsova (). Her father remarried also, to Natalia Hanykova (b Saint Petersburg; 30/20 December 1893; d Nice 20 April 1982), dau of Maj.-Gen. Constantin Nikolaievich Hanykov and his wife Natalia Efimovna Markova, on 11 October 1930 in Paris. After the Russian Revolution, Natalia and her brother Kirill were the only two Romanov descendants in the male line in the USSR; the rest either left or were killed. They lived their entire lives in the USSR.Interview with Eleonora Dostal-Oru√ß (1999-2000's archive) Sabah News 29 January 2000, retrieved 19 June 2011. She was married to Nicholas Vladimirovich Dostal (1909 - 22 April 1959) and had a daughter Eleonora Nikolaievna Dostal-Oru√ß (27 January 1937 - 2009). Her daughter was a socialite, philanthropist, noblewoman and an example of the modern phenomenon of the celebutante who rose to fame not because of her talent but because of her inherited wealth and controversial lifestyle in Turkey. The biographical novel The White Night of St. Petersburg (2004) was written by her second cousin Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark about her grandfather, Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich of Russia, and was based on Natalia's memories of him. She was a friend of Alexander Galich, Yuri Nikulin, Yuri Nagibin, and Alexander Vertinsky.About the family by Andrei Voznesensky includes –ö–Ω—è–∑—å –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ì—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π \\"–ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ö–Ω—è–∑—è –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–∞\\" and –û.–õ—É–Ω—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ \\"–ö–Ω—è–∂–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –º–æ—Ç–æ—Ü–∏–∫–ª–µ\\". Princess Natalia is also known for her brave personality. She was a motor-cyclist in motor- cyclist-circus. Besides, in the war time she was a driver in army. Russian Revolution and Civil war When the revolution progressed, the Iskander family decided that it was safer in Central Asia and joined the old grand duke in Tashkent; the place where Natalia's early childhood had been spent. Natalia was barely one year old when her grandfather was killed by local revolutionaries, the first grand duke to die in the Red Terror. The family never discussed the circumstances of his death, and now no one knows exactly what happened. Her father and uncle Artemi left home to join the Whites, and for a time the two Iskander princes were lost in the swirling havoc of civil war. Prince Alexander was reported missing in action. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries forced Natalia, her brother Kirill and her mother Olga to leave the grand ducal palace, but they did not persecute them. Adult life The family were helped by the fact that their name was Iskander, not Romanov, but even more by the preoccupation of the revolutionaries with their own survival in a bitter seesaw civil war. After the war, the palace became a museum and little Natalia would visit it, aware of the fact that it had once been her home and that all its treasures-armor, sculpture, paintings-had once belonged to her family. The lavish rose garden, shielded by its high walls from Asian dust and harsh desert winds, continued to bloom. And in the cellar, a few hunting dogs still lived. Their master was gone, but they waited for his return. Peace meant that the Bolsheviks would have the opportunity to become interested in the Iskander family, conspicuous because of the memory of the grand duke. Nicholas Constantinovich had spent his own personal funds to build canals for irrigating the crops essential for sustaining the life of the people. But Natalia's mother knew she could expect no gratitude from the Bolsheviks and decided that she would take her family to Moscow. Giving up her husband for lost, she married and changed the name of her children immediately to that of her new husband. Thus Natalia dropped Iskander for Androsova. Moscow offered new jobs and also safety in anonymity of big city life. Former tsarist officers, bureaucrats, professors and merchants hoped to find privacy and security in the bustling new capital of the Soviet regime. The new- Androsovs found a spacious apartment, but a neighbor, apparently wanting the place himself and learning who they really were, threatened to report them to the secret police. The family fled to the Arbat District downtown near the Kremlin and to the squalor of a cramped basement apartment. Because they were neither peasants nor workers, the state gave them the status of lishentzy, people regarded as socially alien, having no right to vote and therefore unable to secure good jobs. Yet they survived. Natalia had grown up to be dazzling in appearance and dashing in manner. Tall and svelte, with finely chiseled (and also very Romanov) features, she had radiant blue eyes, long blond hair and a captivating smile. Her mother, despite changing her name, never tried to conceal the past from Natalia. All the family photographs sat on a shelf in the shabby Androsov apartment: Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich, his brother K.R. and Natalia's father, Prince Alexander Iskander. Natalia would proudly tell close friends of her real origins. Everyone was astonished; one of the friends said disgustedly, \\"Put those pictures away; it is indecent to keep them!\\" But the Androsovs were bold. Friends returning from Siberian exile, political pariahs, always knew that they could spend a few nights with the Androsovs. Natalia perhaps inherited some of her grandfather's propensity for adventure. She did not conceal that she was a Romanov. Motorcyclist She chose a wild career, that of a professional motorcyclist. She joined the famous sports club Dynamo and became a prominent motorcycle racer. Then the troubles came. It was 1939; Russia was experiencing Joseph Stalin's Great Terror, when millions were taken away to die, often inexplicably. Natalia was twenty-two. A young mechanic from Dynamo came courting her. When she boasted of her imperial lineage, he tried to blackmail her into sleeping with him. When she refused, he threatened to report her to the Lubyanka. Married and the mother of one, Natalia slapped him hard across the face. He was very tall and muscular, but \\"I was a very strong woman,\\" she said proudly. Still, she panicked and burned all of her family papers. She changed her sports club and went to another famous one, Spartak. But in several weeks the Lubyanka summoned her. The secret police people were explicit. She had only two options, they said. Either she became a secret agent or she would be shot. Agent Under the codename Lola, Natalia began to work for Stalin's secret police. Her Lubyanka supervisor came regularly to the Arbat where they met, not in her apartment but in the shadows of an archway outside. Years later Natalia learned that her file at the Lubyanka described her in the most flattering terms. She was young, intelligent and attractive. She had, in short, all the qualities of an excellent agent except one: She did not want the job. Her friends knew nothing of her Lubyanka affiliation. But she knew which of them would be arrested and when. Many people found Natalia's manner pleasingly raffish; she dressed in men's jackets and leggins. She smoked. She was proud of her ancestry, especially her grand ducal grandfather. She liked to whisper the guests that she was a Romanov, a descendant of tsars. Soon she became known as the Queen of the Arbat, a district that was taking on some of the character of New York's Greenwich Village. Visitors found hers a warm hearth in a cold and gray metropolis. She embarked on an extraordinary career as a vertical motorcyclist at Gorky Park. She drove the machine up a wall. The secret to success, she said, was to feel the vehicle and to look only forward, never at the wheels. Then the war broke out. World War II In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded Russia. In the fall of that year, when the enemy came very close to capturing Moscow and the Soviet Government fled, Natalia stayed in the city. She was in charge of her neighborhood fire brigade, on the alert for incendiary bombs dropped by German aircraft. When these bombs hit the ground, they exploded and shot out a sea of flames. One had to catch the moment of impact and throw sand over the bomb to smother it before the explosion. Impatient Natalia would often seize the hissing bomb itself and throw it into the sand. Sometimes the white-hot bodies of bombs buried themselves deeply into the asphalt, setting even that aflame, and at night explosions and fires burst out everywhere, with people shouting and horses neighing in terror. Natalia also joined a paramilitary militia as a motorcyclist courier. When she came to her Arbat neighborhood dressed exotically in a brown velvet jacket, army boots and breeches, some passerby, unused to such extravagant dress, detained her as \\"German saboteur.\\" Natalia took another job, driving a truck, delivering bread to the troops at the front and clearing snow from downtown streets afterward. She discovered that she had talent for mechanical matters and she could keep her truck in good repair. As early as the summer 1942, Stalin, feeling more secure about the course of the war, decided that it was time to cheer up his people. He ordered more performances in Moscow; theater, concerts, opera and the circus. After the war Natalia returned to her earlier career as a vertical motorcyclist. In the summer of 1953, just after Stalin's death, they gave her a new assignment, promising it would be her last. Her career as a motercyclist soared. She was at the top of her profession and toured of the USSR. She used the world's best motorcycles such as Harley Davidsons and Indian Scouts. But her performance, called \\"Fearless Flight\\" by people around her, was always dangerous. Sometimes she would spend a month in the hospital nursing broken bones. Natalia became friendly with the leading Moscow bohemians of the day, and they dedicated their poems and stories to her. In July 1964, eligible for a pension, she retired. But when she stopped performing, the world began to forget her and her life took on a smaller dimension. In the late 1998, in her tiny studio apartment, the last Romanov in Russia and the only Russian among Romanovs, lived with her puppy dog which she found dying in the street. The dog was suffering from pneumonia and had been severely beaten. She picked him up, remembering the mournful howls of her grandfather's dogs when the grand duke was gone. She named the dog \\"Malysh\\" (Baby) and Malysh has grown up a healthy ginger-colored mongrel, friendly to visitors, passionately attached to Natalia. On her crutches she took the dog for walks herself, even in wintertime when the sidewalks were frozen. Throughout this term, her daughter and stepsons took care of her. She owned little of the great Romanov treasure, only her grandfather's crested silver spoons, a silver cup made for the coronation of Empress Elizabeth in 1742, a small decorative box, a cross and a tiny hinged icon. Whatever else of value she inherited, she had to sell in hard times. But material objects seemed not of great importance to her. In 1999 she died of old age at the age of 82.

The central shrine has a square superstructure (Shikhara) called Brahmachhanda girva-shikhara. The west and east facing shrines have superstructures called the Rudrachhanda griva- shikhara and Vishnuchhanda griva-shikhara respectively. The design of the superstructures speaks of the artistic taste of the builders. They are three- dimensional, with the first tier (tala) measuring a third of the total height of the tower, and the second tier measuring one half the height of the first. Each of the three shrines have individual vestibules (or half hall or ardhamantapa) which open to a large common open hall called the mahamantapa or navaranga, whose ceiling is supported by four ornate central pillars. At the entrance to the shrines (bilpitha) are the guardians to the \\"eight directions\\"(ashtadikpalaka; ashta - \\"eight\\", dik - \\"directions\\", palaka - \\"keeper\\") with their consorts and vehicles (vahana) The entire complex is oriented towards the impressive Brahmadeva pillar and faces north. The main central shrine houses the image of Adhinatha, the first Jain tirthankara (Teaching God). The west (right) and east (left) facing shrines have the images of later day tirthankaras, Shantinatha and Neminatha respectively. The images appear to be of well-polished steatite material and could be later day replacements. According to Robert J Del Bonto who conducted research at the site, the two shrines that form the later day additions are a twin construction, are lateral (face each other), have individual vestibule and a closed mantapa (hall) and open into a common open pillared porch (open mantapa). The art critic M.H. Dhaky calls them as \\"Shantinatha Basadi\\" and regards them a good example of the \\"terminal\\" stage in Western Ganga art.Sarma (1992), p. 166 The temple exhibits fine sculptures of Jain Yakshas (male benevolent spirits) and Yakshis (their female counterparts) of the Western Ganga and Hoysala periods. According to the art critic and historian S. Settar, generally, Brahmadeva pillars found in front of ancient Jain temples do not house sculptures of the Brahma Yaksha or the god Brahma, rather they find their origins in the Manasthambha (sthambha lit, \\"pillar\\") and have images of the Sarvanubhuti Yaksha. The base of this pillar is square and exhibits looped garland decorations, and at the top supports a two handed seated image of east facing Siddhayika.Sarma (1992), p. 167Settar in Shah (1987), p. 19 The overall composition of the temple, according to Sarma, is one of \\"clarity in structure and function\\" without any emphasis on over decoration.

He was the son of Otto Carl Friedrich Westphal (1800‚Äì1879) and Karoline Friederike Heine and the father of Alexander Karl Otto Westphal (1863-1941). He was married to Klara, daughter of the banker Alexander Mendelssohn.  Academic career  After receiving his doctorate, he worked at the Berlin Charit√©, and subsequently became an assistant in the department for the mentally ill under Wilhelm Griesinger (1817‚Äì1868) and Karl Wilhelm Ideler (1795‚Äì1860). In 1869 he became an associate professor of psychiatry, as well as a clinical instructor in the department for mental and nervous diseases, In 1874 he attained the title of full professor of psychiatry.  Achievements in medicine  Westphal's contributions to medical science are many; in 1871 he coined the term \\"agoraphobia\\", when he observed that three male patients of his displayed extreme anxiety and feelings of dread when they had to enter certain public areas of the city.Narrating social order by Shelley Zipora Reuter He is credited with providing an early diagnosis of \\"pseudosclerosis\\", a disease known today as hepatolenticular degeneration. He also demonstrated a relationship between tabes dorsalis (nerve degeneration in the spinal cord) and paralysis in the mentally insane. Westphal is credited with describing a deep tendon reflex anomaly in tabes dorsalis that later became known as the \\"Erb‚ÄìWestphal symptom\\" (named with neurologist Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840‚Äì1921). His name is also shared with neurologist Ludwig Edinger (1855‚Äì1918) regarding the Edinger‚ÄìWestphal nucleus, which is an accessory nucleus of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve number III; CN III). He was the first physician to provide a clinical description of narcolepsy and cataplexy (1877). French physician Jean-Baptiste-√âdouard G√©lineau (1828‚Äì1906), also described the two maladies, coining the term narcolepsie in 1880. A large portion of his written work dealt with diseases of the spinal cord and neuropathological issues. He trained a number of prominent neurologists and neuropathologists, including Arnold Pick, Hermann Oppenheim, Karl F√ºrstner, Carl Moeli and Karl Wernicke. His son, Alexander Karl Otto Westphal (1863‚Äì1941) was also a psychiatrist, and is associated with the Westphal-Piltz syndrome (neurotonic pupillary reaction). Westphal, in addition to his multiple contributions to neurology and neuroanatomy, has been credited with introducing rational and non-censorious treatment to psychiatric hospitalization in Germany. Michel Foucault credits Westphal for the birth of the modern homosexual, with his paper published in 1870 on 'contrary sexual feeling', in which he describes two people dealing with what would later come to be known as homosexuality. This appears to be one of the first medical accounts of sexuality as a psychiatric disorder.Foucault, Michel. The History of Sexuality Vol. 1: The Will to Knowledge.

Considering the broad cultural sequencing, the Chicama Valley can be considered as an archaeological microcosm. The research benefits from the favourable environmental and topological conditions for material conservation. Huaca Prieta is the earliest part of the complex but the biggest constructions on the site belong to the Moche culture. In this area, there are also the remains of the later Lambayeque and Chim√∫. Early Intermediate Period The development of the Brujo Archaeological Complex during the Intermediate Period falls within a context of early complex societies construction. During the Moche era, monumental religious and socio- political centers usually named huacas were built. Although the architecture, the iconography and the practice of sacrifice relate the Brujo Complex to a ceremonial, ritual and funerary site, the constructions are considered as the result of labor the ‚Äúcaciques‚Äù controlled. The huacas of the Early Intermediate Period (200 B.C. 600 A.D.) seem to have exerted a polymorphous and centrifugal power, yet the complex is located in a difficult weather condition area. The Brujo Complex is represented by three major huacas. The Huaca Prieta mound dates back to the preceramic times. Huaca Cortada and Huaca Cao Viejo (the largest) are stepped truncated pyramids constructed at the northern corners of the terrace during the EIP. Building archaeology unveils seven phases of construction spanning the early and middle phases of Moche era. Huaca Cao Viejo is famous for its polychrome reliefs and mural paintings, and the discovery of the Se√±ora de Cao, whose remains are currently the earliest evidence for a female ruler in Peru. Both appeared in National Geographic magazine in July 2004 and June 2006. The site officially opened to the public in May 2006, and a museum exhibition was proposed for 2007. Post- Moche Era The abandonment of the Huacas at the end of the Early Intermediate Period could have been linked to the political instability and upheavals of the Southern sphere of the Moche. Some archaeologists also point out the extreme climatic events at the end of the Intermediate Period that could have led to the decline of the culture. However, the informations relating to the end of the period are limited. The Lambayeque Culture arose in the Chicama Valley around 900 A.D. before being successively incorporated in the Chimu and the Inca expansive empires. Nevertheless, The Brujo Archaeological Complex remained a ceremonial and funerary area dedicated to the collective memory. 17th-century A 17th-century letter found during excavations at the site may contain translations of numbers written in Quingnam or Pescadora using the decimal system, the first physical evidence for the existence of these languages (if they are not different names for the same language). Archaeologists believe that the language was influenced by Quechua, an ancient tongue still spoken by millions of people across the Andes.

He most recently served head coach of Brescia in the Serie B league in the final weeks of the 2016‚Äì17 Serie B season.  Playing career  Cagni made his Serie A debut for Brescia in 1970, in a league match lost 4‚Äì0 to Cagliari. He played only eight Serie A matches, but gained a deep experience of Serie B, where he played 483 matches and scored 5 goals. Having played 483 matches in Serie B, he is currently the player with the most appearances in Serie B.  Managerial career  After a season as youth team coach in his home team Brescia, Cagni coached Centese of Serie C2 in 1989‚Äì90, and successively signed for Piacenza of Serie C1 in 1990‚Äì91, becoming one of the main authors of Piacenza's first appearance in Serie A, in 1993. Cagni stayed at Piacenza until 1996, when he moved to Hellas Verona F.C., again in Serie A. However, Cagni was not able to maintain his team to the top division, and Verona was relegated. Since then, Cagni mostly served for Serie B teams, with the exception of Piacenza, who rehired him in 2002‚Äì03 in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid relegation. In January 2006, after the dismissal of Mario Somma, Empoli appointed Cagni as head coach. Under his tenure, the experienced boss was able to lead the team up to tenth place, then become seventh following the Calciopoli scandal. His contract with Empoli was extended in March 2007 for another year, following impressive performances which led the team to fight for and eventually gain a spot in the next UEFA Cup, the first appearance in a continental competition for both the small Tuscan club and Cagni himself. However a poor start in the Serie A 2007‚Äì08, and a UEFA Cup elimination in the first round to FC Zurich convinced Empoli's management to sack Cagni, appointing Alberto Malesani as replacement. On 31 March 2008 he was re-called at the helm of Empoli, following the club board's decision to fire Malesani too, but he did not manage to save the club from last matchday relegation. He resigned after the verdict. On 29 May 2008, it was announced that Cagni signed a two-year contract with Parma and was to coach the club in their first season in Serie B in 18 years. However, on 30 September 2008 he was fired by his team, Parma, and replaced by Francesco Guidolin. On 6 October 2011 he became the new coach of Vicenza in Serie B, in place of the sacked Silvio Baldini. On 4 March 2012 he was sacked, but on 29 April 2012 he was recalled by Vicenza, but he could not save the team from relegation. He then served as Walter Zenga's assistant at Sampdoria for a short period at the beginning of the 2015‚Äì16 season, being sacked from his position in September 2015. On 12 March 2017, he was named new head coach of his hometown club Brescia in the Serie B league, taking over from outgoing manager Cristian Brocchi. Under his tenure, he managed to save Brescia from relegation, and left by the end of the season to make room for new head coach Roberto Boscaglia.

It was the last published of the seven Chrestomanci books (1977 to 2006).Chrestomanci series at ISFDB. It revisits Chrestomanci Castle and the character of Cat Chant from her first Chrestomanci book, but also introduces the character of Marianne Pinhoe, who lives in the village near the castle and whose family practices a rather different sort of magic from any that Chrestomanci or his charges have encountered. The Chrestomanci books are collectively named for a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours, who supervises the use of magic ‚Äîor the Chrestomanci, an office that requires a powerful enchanter and is responsible for supervising. The Pinhoe Egg is set in our time, during the tenure of Christopher Chant, who is Chrestomanci in five of the seven books and is often called Chrestomanci as a personal name. Plot Marianne Pinhoe's family tries to keep their magic a secret. They don't want the \\"Big Man\\", or Chrestomanci, interfering, as he tends to do when people misuse magic. And the Pinhoes certainly are guilty of that. Gammer, the head of the Pinhoe clan, has ostensibly gone mad, but Marianne doesn't believe that she's completely 'round the twist. She's sure that Gammer's the one sending plagues to the Farleighs, a related clan that also wishes to stay out of the sights of the \\"Big Man\\". Until recently, the Farleighs and the Pinhoes had been working together, but it seems that Gammer has started a war, and it'll be hard to keep their operations under wraps for long. Meanwhile, up at the Castle, Cat acquires a horse. He also meets the man who was bootboy at the Castle when the current Chrestomanci was a lad, Jason, and helps him and his new wife choose a house. They finally settle on Woods House, Gammer's old place, and Marianne, while showing Cat around, gives him an old egg from the attic, an egg with strong \\"Don't Notice\\" spells placed on it. An egg that is sure to arouse the interest of the \\"Big Man\\" up at the castle ‚Äì something the rest of the Pinhoe clan, and Gammer in particular, doesn't want at all. Characters Marianne Pinhoe: Marianne is the main protagonist of the book. She is set to be the next Gammer of the Pinhoe clan, but that isn't what she wants at all. She has very strong magic, but, like many of Jones' characters, doesn't know it. She is an enchantress, although her mother trains her up to be a witch. She seems to have a lot of \\"dwimmer,\\" which is a sort of magic. Joe Pinhoe: Marianne's brother is sent to work as a bootboy (and spy) up at Chrestomanci Castle. He isn't really interested in the work, however, and mostly idles about. He is a disappointment to the family, but he'd fixed it that way on purpose. He likes to fix up contraptions using magic and machinery, and he and Roger try to turn it into a lucrative business scheme. Eric \\"Cat\\" Chant: In the first Chrestomanci book, Cat is a very lonely character, clinging to his older sister and, later, to Janet, and distrusting the adults of the Castle. In this book, we see that he has not only grown to like and trust the people of the Castle, but he forms many new friendships, both with characters older than himself (Jason the former bootboy and his wife, Irene), and characters of his own age (Marianne). He acquires a horse (Syracuse) whom he has an intimate friendship with, and a griffin (Klartch), although Klartch had been a mistake, hatched from an egg Marianne had given him. Roger Chant: Roger is the son of Chrestomanci (Christopher Chant) and Millie (the Living Asheth from The Lives of Christopher Chant). He, like his sister, is quite fat. Instead of wishing for a horse, he acquired a bicycle. He makes quite good friends with Joe Pinhoe, and together create a flying machine, which they work on in secret. Julia Chant: Julia is the daughter of Chrestomanci and Millie. She caught the horse fever from Janet, and tried to ride Syracuse, but found she couldn't deal with his temperament, so he became Cat's horse. She used to have a crush on Jason, and is upset that when she learns that he is married. Janet Chant: Janet is the other world equivalent of Cat's sister, Gwendolen. She used to live in the normal world (suspected to be our world) and got to Cat's world by the works of Gwendolen. Although she can get fiery sometimes, she is usually kind and sympathetic. Janet discovers she is one of those people afraid of horses. She, like Julia, had been infatuated with Jason, but was much more devastated than Julia when he showed up married, seeing as she had been planning to marry him in the future. Irene: Irene is the woman who married Jason. She is described as having an \\"Egyptian profile, with dark hair.\\" She, by her faithful gardener and Marianne, is called \\"Princess Irene.\\" She is the kind of woman that most people end up liking, even Janet and Julia. She is a Pinhoe, and ends up buying Gammer's old house. It is strongly implied that she will become the next Gammer, seeing as she has a lot of dwimmer. Chrestomanci: Also known as Christopher Chant. Referred to as \\"The Big Man\\" by the Pinhoes. 'Chrestomanci' is the title of the post held by a nine-lived enchanter who keeps order in the magical realms. Father of Roger and Julia Chant, and guardian of Janet Chant. Cat is apprenticed to him to become the next Chrestomanci. Millie: Chrestomanci's wife, a kind, loving woman and a powerful enchantress.

History The Landsmanshaft organizations aided immigrants' transitions from Europe to America by providing social structure and support to those who arrived in the United States without the family networks and practical skills that had sustained them in Europe. Toward the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th centuries, they provided immigrants help in learning English, finding a place to live and work, locating family and friends, and an introduction to participating in a democracy, through their own meetings and procedures such as voting on officers, holding debates on community issues, and paying dues to support the society. Through the first half of the 20th century, meetings were often conducted and minutes recorded in Yiddish, which was the language that all members could understand. As Jewish immigration declined, most landsmanshaft functions faded into the background, but the organizations nevertheless continued as a way of maintaining ties to life in Europe as well as providing a form of life insurance, disability and unemployment insurance, and subsidized burial. Members paid dues on a regular basis, and if they lost their jobs, became too sick to work, or died, the society paid the member or their family a benefit to keep them afloat during that time. When the funds were not needed to support members, landsmanshaftn frequently invested the money in funds that supported the Jewish community in others ways, such as Israel Bonds.Weisser, Michael R., A Brotherhood of Memory: Jewish Landsmanshaftn in the New World, Cornell University Press, 1985, , p. 14-23. Most landsmanshaftn were based in New York City, where the majority of Jews settled and conditions were conducive to sustaining these types of organizations, though they sometimes relocated as the membership migrated to the suburbs. Types There were different types of landsmanshaftn, including Jewish burial societies known as chevra kadisha, societies associated with a particular synagogue or social movement, and \\"ladies auxiliary\\" societies for women.Weisser, Michael R., A Brotherhood of Memory: Jewish Landsmanshaftn in the New World, Cornell University Press, 1985, , p. 13-14. (Landsmanshaftn frequently admitted only men as members, with the understanding that their wives and children were covered by their membership and received equivalent benefits, or had a ladies' auxiliary group for women). The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring is a mutual aid society with more than 200 branches, but because it is not based on geography or members' hometowns, is not strictly a landsmanshaft even though it largely functions as one. In 1938, a federal Works Progress Administration project identified 2,468 landsmanshaftn in New York City, where the overwhelming number in the United States were located. The number of landsmanshaftn began to decline in the 1950s and 1960s as their members died and were not replaced by the next generation of their members' children. The vast majority became defunct, though some societies continue to meet regularly into the 21st century, and operate scores of burial plots in cemeteries in the New York metropolitan area. Decline Over time, landsmanshaftn lost members as they aged and died, and many became defunct. The next generation felt less need of a connection to Europe, relied on the national programs of the New Deal if they needed financial support during difficult times, and because they were not immigrants, didn't need landsmanshaftn to socialize or meet others. When officers were not replaced, it sometimes resulted in difficulties for the relatives of members who died, because the officers were required to issue burial permits to the cemeteries in which their plots were located. The state of New York, particularly the Department of Insurance, stepped in to take over these functions for some groups. Many records of defunct landsmanshaftn eventually made their way from the New York State Department of Insurance to the archives of YIVO.

He also served as one of the key advisors in instituting Maria Theresa's reforms. Haugwitz attempted to bring both centralization and economic reform to the Habsburg lands.  Biography  In this position, Haugwitz presided over the hereditary lands of the Habsburg Monarchy. After 1760, the chancery also dealt in the affairs of Bohemia.Robert A. Kann, History of the Habsburg Empire 1526-1918 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), 173. The Directorium in publicis et cameralibus became a centralized agency established with the advisement of Haugwitz to deal with matters such as ‚Äúinternational administration and taxation, public safety, social welfare, education, church matters, mining and commerce‚Äù.Grete Klingenstein, ‚ÄúBetween Mercantalism and Physiocracy‚Äù in State and Society in Early Modern Austria, ed. Charles W. Ingrao (West Lafayette, Indiana: Purdue Research Foundation 1994), 204. It is clear from Maria Theresa's testament that Haugwitz was one of her most valued advisors. ‚ÄúHe was truly sent to me by Providence, for to break the deadlock I needed such a man, honorable, disinterested, without predispositions, and with neither ambition nor hangers-on, who supported what was good because he saw it to be good‚Ä¶‚ÄùMaria Theresa, \\"Testament,\\" in The Habsburg and Hohenzollern Dynasties in The Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, ed. C.A. Macartney (New York: Walker and Company 1970), 118. Haugwitz‚Äô father was a general in the service of Saxony.Maria Theresa (Bloomsbury Reader), Edward Crankshaw, 1969, chapter 7 As a young man‚Äô Haugwitz went to Rome and then entered the civil service in Silesia. This job came to an end when Frederick II invaded Silesia and Haugwitz escaped to Vienna. Maria Theresa sent him to the remaining part of Silesia under her rule to get the finances in order.crankshaw chapter 7 Haugwitz, as a student of the Austrian cameralist, Wilhelm von Schr√∂der, learned hostility towards the wealthy estates. Haugwitz was also an admirer of the reforms and new administration in the Prussian province of Silesia.H.M. Scott, ‚ÄúReform in the Habsburg Monarchy,‚Äù in Enlightened Absolutism Reform and Reformers in Later Eighteenth-Century Europe, ed. H.M. Scott (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 1990), 152. He intended to change economic and administrative institutions through compartmentalization of government functions, education, centralization of the economy and provision of economic information to the monarchy. In terms of compartmentalization, Haugwitz instituted a separation of judicial matters from political and fiscal matters by instituting a new High Court (Oberste Justizstelle).Scott, 154. Regional courts functioned directly beneath the Empress with each departmental chief supervising his own affairs.Reverend James Franck Bright, Maria Theresa 3rd ed. (London: Macmillan, 1920), 191. Haugwitz also focused on another important initiative to bring modern economic thought to students. Maria Theresa had established the Theresianum to train noble children for civil service. Through this institution, Haugwitz planned to bring about economic modernization. To catalyze this modernization and establish Vienna as a place of economic discourse, Haugwitz brought Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi to Vienna, first to teach German as the language of administration and later to train students according to both German Kameralism and modern economic theories and practices. As both a former soldier in Prussia and a Protestant, Justi was not well liked in Vienna. Because of this mistrust, Justi lacked the access to pertinent economic data required to execute his theories.Klingenstein, 204. Society was also not prepared for modern economic thought because of the traditionally Jesuit nature of scholarship and the division of the Habsburg economy into various regional and local economies.Klingenstein, 192. In 1746, under the direction of Haugwitz, in an attempt to bring about economic centralization, the Directorium was established as a central agency to supervise the lands in the monarchy and make recommendations about economic improvements.Herman Freudenberger \\"Introduction\\" in State and Society in Early Modern Austria, ed. Charles W. Ingrao (West Lafayette, Indiana: Purdue Research Foundation, 1994), 144. In 1749, the government established Representationen und Cammern as local offices of the Directorium chiefly as mechanisms for supervising tax policy. Because of this economic centralization, Haugwitz provided Emperor Joseph II with an unprecedented amount of information about the economies of the states over which he would reign. As part of Joseph II's education, he received an extensive overview of the economic makeup of each state. Such a report was unprecedented because it would traditionally have been viewed as an intrusion in the affairs normally reserved to the estates.Klingenstein, 194. All of these reforms helped to bring about the eventual peak of mercantilism in the 1760s.Ingrao 144. Military reforms complimented Haugwitz's economic initiatives. Due to his belief in the need for ‚Äúimmediate supremacy of the sovereign over the army, and the maintenance of an adequate body of troops even in time of peace,‚Äù Haugwitz contributed to military reform in both funding and the development of a standing army.Bright, 68. To protect the monarchy, Haugwitz recommended a standing army of 108,000 supported by contributions by the estates of 14 million gulden. To avoid the previous issues in estates' withholding of contributions, or the tedious process of frequent appeals to the estates, Haugwitz instituted the Ten Years‚Äô Recess. Under this program, despite the resistance of the estates, the estates would guarantee payment for ten years. This period abolished the previous fluctuations in finances.Bright, 68-72. Previously, when taxes were levied from the estates, the estates disagreed amongst themselves over the amount levied, divided the sum among the various estates, collected taxes from the peasantry, deducted from these taxes and then distributed the remainder to the monarchy. In this reform, Representationen und Cammern collected the taxes in order that the greatest portion of the levy would be distributed to the monarchy.Olwen H. Hufton, Europe: Privilege and Protest 1730-1789, 2nd Ed. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), 119. In addition to these military finance reforms, Haugwitz instituted reforms within the military. A policy quite close to conscription was established. Uniform dress was required of soldiers in order to foster national spirit. Haugwitz advocated the usage of Prussian fighting tactics. A training school was founded to train officers in these tactics.G. P. Gooch, Maria Theresa and Other Studies (London: Longmans, Green and Company, 1951), 5. Despite the large-scale nature and depth of Haugwitz's reforms, their efficacy was not as great as he had intended. Haugwitz's attempt to transform the monarchy from a ‚Äúfeudal aristocracy‚Äù to a ‚Äúwell- organised-despotism‚Äù was incomplete. (Franck p. 190) The superior court system that established local judges, while initially an attempt at both centralization and organization brought about the opposite due to the tremendous autonomy of each departmental chief.Bright, 191. Furthermore, the reforms had limited scope, because they were not aimed at nor did they have any effect on Hungary, Transylvania, Austria, the Netherlands, or Lombardy.Scott, 155. The beginning of the Seven Years‚Äô War in 1757 thwarted the development of many of the reforms.Longmans, 9. In false defense of his failing policies, Haugwitz argued that the reforms ‚Äúwere only for peacetime‚Äù. Eventually, Haugwitz's Directorium was stripped of its military and financial functions and renamed the Bohemian and Austrian Court Chancellery.Scott, 155-166. Most power now became centered in the Council of State headed by Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz. Kaunitz, a historic foe of Haugwitz, replaced him in instituting policies. However, Haugwitz's policies would have an effect throughout the reign of Maria Theresa and later in the reign of Joseph II. Early in his career the composer Joseph Haydn was briefly in Count Haugwitz's employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz.Rita Steblin, 'Haydns Orgeldienste \\"in der damaligen Gr√§fl. Haugwitzischen Kapelle\\"', in: Wiener Geschichtsbl√§tter 65/2000, p. 124-34.  Death  In the summer of 1765, he moved to one of his castles in Miroslavsk√© Kn√≠nice, where, due to dysentery, his health worsened. He died on 30 August 1765. His body was taken to N√°mƒõ≈°≈• nad Oslavou, where he was buried on 1 September 1765 in the crypt of the Church of St. John the Baptist. Later, his remains, along with those of his wife, were moved, on 19 February 1768, to a crypt in the Capuchin church near the castle in N√°mƒõ≈°≈•.

(For example: it would, perhaps, be preferable to lower a wealthy person's income in order to increase a poorer person's income by the same amount.) Here any characteristics that define each person (skills, aptitudes, etc.) are distinguished from the rest of the social state and put on a par with conventional measures of wealth insofar as they affect an extended sympathy judgment. In his seminal work on social choice theory, Kenneth Arrow (1963) mentions the ancient lineage of extended sympathy in ethical writings and its basic, if informal, character in many welfare judgments. Arrow's book itself (p. 9) uses individual preference orderings rather than real-valued measures of preferences. This excludes interpersonal comparisons of welfare in a precise sense (invariance of social choices to linear cardinalizations of individual preference orderings). Extended-sympathy interpersonal comparisons of welfare relax that constraint (Arrow, 1983, pp. 151‚Äì2). Such comparisons expand the informational base of welfare-theoretical decisions, as Amartya Sen (1982) has emphasized. Still, variants of Arrow's dictatorial result persist in reformulation (Suzumura, 1997, p. 221).  References  * Kenneth J. Arrow, 1951, 2nd ed.,1963, Social Choice and Individual Values, ch.

She was commissioned 11 May 1996 and decommissioned 1 December 2007. Stricken from the Navy list 1 December 2007, sold by U.S. General Services Administration for scrap, 8 May 2014. Black Hawk was of the MHC 51 class of ships, which are the world's largest glass reinforced plastic (GRP) ships and the first U.S. Navy ships designed solely for mine hunting; the technique of locating mines with sonar and neutralizing them with a remotely controlled underwater vehicle or divers. The ship's mission was to clear harbor, coastal, and ocean waters of acoustic, magnetic and pressure/contact type mines utilizing reconnaissance, classification and neutralization tactics. Exceptionally low magnetic and acoustic signatures protect the ship against detonations during mine hunting operations. Black Hawk (MHC-58) was the eighth ship in the U.S. MHC 51 (Osprey) Class Coastal Minehunter Program and the third U.S. Navy ship to bear that name. Black Hawk's keel was laid on September 3, 1992 and her christening and launching was on August 27, 1994 at Intermarine USA Corporation, Savannah, Georgia. USS Black Hawk (MHC-58) was commissioned in ceremonies held on May 11, 1996, at Pier Two at the Naval Education Training Center, Newport, R.I.frame Shield and crest The ship's shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy to reflect the sea and excellence. Black is indicative of strength and stability. Blue denotes loyalty and devotion. White is emblematic of integrity and is symbolic of sea foam and breakers. The two mines recall the two previous ships of the same name and underscore the Black Hawk's mine hunting capabilities. The stylized paddlewheel is reminiscent of the first Black Hawk (a sidewheel steamer which served as flagship for Rear Admiral D.D. Porter and S.P. Lee, successive commander of the Mississippi Squadron). The paddle wheel further simulates a maritime compass suggesting leadership, guidance and alludes to navigation and the far reaching scope and mission of the past and present USS Black Hawk. The annulets incorporated into the paddle wheel suggest continual efforts. The paddle wheel, together with the two mines, symbolize the three ships bearing the name Black Hawk. On the ship's crest, the waves of the sea denote the coastal waters, harbors, waterways and Navy theater of operations. The stylized black hawk reflects the continuous aggressiveness of the Black Hawk and its crew in carrying out their mission of minehunting, fueling, repairing and keeping combatant vessels in fighting trim. The name Black Hawk was derived from Indian Chief Black Hawk mentioned in history as the leader of the Sac & Fox tribes during the Black Hawk War. The star on the hawk's wing is commemorative of the battle star received by the second Black Hawk for her service in World War II. Previous namesakes Two previous U.S. Navy ships have borne the name Black Hawk. The first Black Hawk was a side-wheeler river steamer that served as flagship of the Mississippi Squadron from December 1862 through May 1864. On 22 April 1865, she burned and sank. Her wreck was raised and sold in April 1867. The second Black Hawk was commissioned 16 May 1918, and assigned as tender and flagship to the Mine Force in Inverness, Scotland from June 1918 until the end of World War I, when her base was shifted to the North Sea. She was designated a destroyer tender in November 1920 and she tended destroyer squadrons until 1942. She was decommissioned 15 August 1946. Black Hawk received one battle star for her service in World War II.

There are approximately 16 different species in L. brevis group.Pavlova, S. I., Kilic, A. O., Kilic, S. S., So, J. S., Nader‚ÄêMacias, M. E., Simoes, J. A., & Tao, L. (2002). Genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Journal of Applied Microbiology, 92(3), 451-459. It can be found in many different environments, such as fermented foods, and as normal microbiota. L.brevis is found in food such as sauerkraut and pickles. It is also one of the most common causes of beer spoilage. Ingestion has been shown to improve human immune function, and it has been patented several times. Normal gut microbiota L.brevis is found in human intestines, vagina and feces. L. brevis is one of the major Lactobacillus species found in tibicos grains, used to make kefir, and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the polysaccharide (dextran) that forms the grains. Major metabolites of L. brevis include lactic acid and ethanol. Strains of L. brevis and L. hilgardii have been found to produce the biogenic amines tyramine and phenylethylamine. History E.B.Fred, W.H. Peterson, and J.A. Anderson initially discovered the entire Lactobacillus species in 1921 and the species was categorized based on the ability to metabolize certain carbon and sugars. This early study showed that this can produce acetic acid, carbon dioxide and large amounts of mannitol. Mannitol which is another carbon source that can be used to produce lactic acid.FRED, E.B., PETERSON,W.H., AND ANDERSON,J. A., J.Biol. Chem., 48, 385 (1921) Growth L. brevis has been shown to actively transport glucose and galactose. When fructose was used as a carbon source there was only some growth and L. brevis was able to partially metabolize the fructose to mannitol. Normal growth follows the lactic acid pathway that is commonly used by most lactic acid bacterium. There are some strains that poorly metabolize glucose, whereas other strain are able to easily metabolize the sugar. As stated, this is considered a lactic acid pathway.Lactic acid fermentationBy using the fermentation pathway the end result is lactic acid.Annuk, H., Shchepetova, J., Kullisaar, T., Songisepp, E., Zilmer, M., & Mikelsaar, M. (2003). Characterization of intestinal lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates. Journal of Applied Microbiology, 94(3), 403-412. It appears that under high temperature conditions, 50 degrees Celsius and in acidic environments the survival of this bacteria is longer than most bacteria under acidic conditions, the bacteria can live about 45 minutes.Saarela, M., Rantala, M., Hallamaa, K., Nohynek, L., Virkaj√§rvi, I., & M√§tt√∂, J. (2004). Stationary‚Äêphase acid and heat treatments for improvement of the viability of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Journal of applied Science. Antibiotic resistance is acquired through conjugation, a method of bacterial reproduction. Conjugation permits a sharing of DNA allowing the bacterium to learn about various antibiotics through exposure and this information is passed down through replication between bacteria. Conjugation L. brevis produces more organic acids, specifically acetic acid and ethanol. This means that this bacterium produces an increased acidic environment and alcohol. Growth conditions all depend on the location of the bacterium within the intestines. It does seem that they are unable to significantly replicate in anaerobic environments.  Metabolic pathway  Metabolic pathways are defined to mean the chemical process that occurs within an organism. L. brevis uses the glycolysis process to metabolize carbon sources by active transport, which moves material against the concentration gradient, normally this occurs is a movement from a high to low concentration. This pathway is used in probiotics and food preservation. glycolysis, a schematic overview.  Food preservation  L. brevis is found in food such as sauerkraut and pickles. It is also one of the most common causes of beer spoilage. The hop, which is an antimicrobial bitter flavoring agent in beer, fails to suppress some strains of L. brevis because they produce a transporter that pumps the active agents of hops out of the bacterial cell.Sami, M., Yamashita, H., Hirono, T., Kadokura, H., Kitamoto, K., Yoda, K., & Yamasaki, M. (1997). Hop-resistant Lactobacillus brevis contains a novel plasmid harboring a multidrug resistance-like gene. Journal of fermentation and bioengineering, 84(1), 1-6.Schmalreck, A.

Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 21(2), 205-212. L. brevis is one of the major Lactobacillus species found in tibicos grains (aka water kefir grains), and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the polysaccharide (dextran) that forms the grains. Major metabolites of L. brevis include lactic acid and ethanol. Strains of L. brevis and L. hilgardii have been found to produce the biogenic amines tyramine, which is found by the fermentation metabolic pathway and is commonly found in spoiled or fermented foods and phenylethylamine, which is found in chocolates but can also produce a fishy odor in other foods. Crushed hop  Microbial physiology  As a bacterium there are some physical attributes that are common for all bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria consists of an external plasma membrane, followed by periplasmic space and finally a peptidoglycan layer, which faces the interior of the bacteria. The external plasma membrane is very important for bacteria because this is how cells recognize the possible pathogenesis of the bacteria. Peptidoglycan is also called murein and is made up of a series of sugars. Within gram-positive bacteria the peptidoglycan layer is much thicker than gram-negative bacteria. The actual lattice that comprises peptidoglycan is referred to as the S-layer; this lattice is linked to the peptidoglycan layer. Unfortunately, the S-layer is normally lost when processing the bacteria under laboratory conditions, which can affect measuring adhesion. When the S-layer is dissolved with high concentration levels of substances that break down hydrogen bonds the S-layers have a survival time of about 20 minutes with each generation. L.brevis contains approximately two promoters within this area, meaning that there is significant transcription of the S-layer by high levels of transcribing of the sIpA gene.S√°ra, M., & Sleytr, U. B. (2000). S-layer proteins. Journal of Bacteriology, 182(4), 859-868. SipA is a gene that has been found to aid in the coding for the production of murin (peptidoglycan) within the bacteria. The purpose of transcription is to copy DNA into a mRNA, which is used to create proteins. The promoter is used during transcription to identify the appropriate location to begin transcribing. Within probiotics it is actually the S-layer that attaches to the cellular wall of the gastrointestinal tract Hy√∂nen, U., Westerlund-Wikstr√∂m, B., Palva, A. and Korhonen, T.K. (2002) Identification by flagellum display of an epithelial cell- and fibronectin- binding function in the SipA surface protein of Lactobacillus brevis. Infect. Immun. 184, 3360‚Äì3367. Gram-positive cellwall-schematic Probiotics Ingestion of probiotics has been shown to improve human immune function, and L. brevis has been patented several times. L. brevis has been shown to survive in the gastrointestinal tract in humans and can therefore be used as a probiotic. Currently the bacterium does not have the ability to convert milk to yogurt however, they are appropriate to be used as an alternative to other probiotics in yogurts. Within the geriatric population use of the bacteria in milk has been shown to increase cellular immunity. Dietary probiotic supplementation enhances natural killer cell activity in the elderly (an investigation of age-related immunological changes). L. brevis is considered appropriate for probiotic use because there is significant growth at pH's 4‚Äì5, pH 5 is normally the appropriate range for milk and yogurts. Biotherapies There are significant vaginal bacteria that are found within the vagina and L. brevis is included in this microbiome, which is a collection of various bacteria. The bacteria collaborate on protecting the vagina and vaginal maintenance. Women of childbearing ages have a significant amount of L.brevis and this is normally found in a healthy vagina.V√°squez, A., Jakobsson, T., Ahrn√©, S., Forsum, U., & Molin, G. (2002). Vaginal Lactobacillus flora of healthy Swedish women. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 40(8), 2746-2749. For some illnesses or disruptions of the vagina this bacteria can be used in aiding to restore the microbiome. Most of the Lactobacillus species of bacteria have been found useful in preventing urinary tract infections. The efficiency in which a bacterium can defend the body is: (1) Their symbiosis with potential pathogens. (2) Their capability of producing antibacterial materials, such as hydrogen peroxide, to limit pathogen growth. (3) Their production of biosurfactants that inhibit pathogen adherence. (4) Their ability to prime macrophages, leukocytes, cytokines, and other host defenses. Raz, R., & Stamm, W. E. (1993). A controlled trial of intravaginal estriol in postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections. New England Journal of Medicine, 329(11), 753-756. During normal childbirth, it appears that newborns after a period of days receive transmission of L. brevis from the mother. It appears that the transmission occurs through breast feeding or through natural child birth.Matsumiya, Y., Kato, N., Watanabe, K., & Kato, H. (2002). Molecular epidemiological study of vertical transmission of vaginal Lactobacillus species from mothers to newborn infants in Japanese, by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction. Journal of Infection and chemotherapy, 8(1), 43-49. In infants, this resistance is also helpful with protecting the gut against various bile and acids. Helicobacter pylori, which is a common gut pathogen in humans, studies have shown that certain strains of L.brevis are successful at combating this pathogen. Vaginosis is the most common form of bacterial infection this is commonly diagnosed as a yeast infection or trichomoniasis, which is a sexually transmitted parasite commonly acquired during intercourse. L.brevis along with Lactobacillus jensenii has been shown to produce high levels of hydrogen peroxide which may be able remediate the bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.Eschenbach, D. A., Davick, P. R., Williams, B. L., Klebanoff, S. J., Young-Smith, K., Critchlow, C. M., & Holmes, K. K. (1989). Prevalence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus species in normal women and women with bacterial vaginosis. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 27(2), 251-256.L. Brevis is a commonly used ingredient in pharmaceutical materials used to treat vaginosis. An evaluation of clue cells is one method of assessing vaginosis; this assessment is performed by mounting clue cells and vaginal discharge onto a slide then adding sodium chloride followed by a microscopic assessment which involves bacteria identification. In addition to surviving within the gut of an organism, L.Brevis can also act to inhibit the pathogenic effects of certain gut pathogens and can also proliferate in the presence of additional bacteria. Some strains are resistant to certain antibiotics, specifically erythromycin and clindamycin.Delgado, S., Fl√≥rez, A. B., & Mayo, B. (2005). Antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract. Current Microbiology, 50(4), 202-207. This antibiotic resistance may be helpful in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome when taking prescribed antibiotics. Clue cells - CDC PHIL 3720 References Jayaram, S., Castle, G. S.

Pratt was born in Anson County, North Carolina on March 5, 1902. She attended Queens College in Charlotte, North Carolina from 1918 to 1920. In 1923, Pratt worked as an editor for the Montgomerian newspaper in Troy, North Carolina. In 1924, she was hired as an administrative assistant for Congressman William C. Hammer. Following Hammer's death in 1930, Pratt worked for a succession of North Carolina representatives: Hinton James, J. Walter Lambeth and William O. Burgin. When Burgin died in office in 1946, Pratt was elected as a Democrat to fill the vacancy. She served from May 25, 1946, to January 3, 1947, and was not a candidate in the 1946 general election. During her time in office, Pratt was appointed to three committees: Pensions, Territories, and Flood Control.

On 29 October 1953, the flight was conducted by a Douglas DC-6 named Resolution and registered in Australia as VH-BPE. The propliner crashed during its initial approach towards San Francisco International Airport, killing all 19 people on board, including the American pianist William Kapell.\\"19 Killed in B.C.P.A. Crash In U.S.A.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì 31 October 1953, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 17 August 2012  History of the flight  The aircraft was flying the Honolulu ‚Äì San Francisco leg with a crew of 8, and 11 passengers (10 adults and 1 child). The estimated flying time was 9 hours and 25 minutes. Captain Bruce N. Dickson (aged 34) and his crew took over the plane in Honolulu as scheduled. Dickson and his First Officer, Frank A. Campbell (aged 28), each had several thousand hours of flight time in the DC-6. Both pilots had made more than 100 approaches into San Francisco Airport, many of which were instrument approaches. On 29 October the weather in the San Francisco area did not present adverse flight conditions, but visual reference with the ground was prevented by the overcast foggy conditions so an instrument approach was required. As the flight neared the California coast, the crew contacted San Francisco Air Route Traffic Control (ARTC). At 8:07 am Pacific Standard Time, it was cleared to descend in accordance with Visual Flight Rules and to maintain at least on top of clouds, which the crew acknowledged. At 8:15 am, the flight reported that it was starting its descent, and at that time was given the San Francisco weather report. Just after 8:21 am, ARTC cleared the flight to the San Francisco instrument landing system (ILS) outer marker beacon via the Half Moon Bay fan marker direct to the San Francisco outer marker, with instructions to maintain at least above all clouds and to contact San Francisco approach control after passing the Half Moon Bay fan marker. At 8:39 am, the crew called San Francisco approach control and advised that it was over Half Moon Bay, on top of clouds. Approximately three minutes later, the crew reported \\"southeast, turning inbound\\". At 8:45 am, a call to the flight was unanswered as were all subsequent calls. Local resident George Bordi heard the plane fly overhead in thick fog, then moments later heard the tremendous \\"crump\\" sound of the plane impacting on nearby terrain. William Kapell, a New York pianist who was returning from a concert tour in Australia, was among the eleven passengers and eight crewmembers who lost their lives. Kapell was the only US citizen on the plane. All the crew and 7 passengers were from Australia. Two passengers were from the United Kingdom, and one from Canada.  Search and recovery  Many hours after the crash, members of search parties, who had difficulty getting through a dense wood at the base of King's Mountain, said they could find no survivors. Red Cross volunteers and emergency personnel, including what would become the first forensic investigation team in the United States, recovered bodies and wreckage, used dental records to identify remains, and put out three forest fires started by the crash. The Redwood City Armory was used by the sheriff's department as a makeshift morgue. Except for the body of William Kapell, which was quickly transported by family members back to his home state of New York, bodies were cremated at Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California and returned to their families. Two did remain in the cemetery, passenger Williaam (sic) Cox in a standard plot, while purser Knight's ashes were placed in a niche in the columbarium at Cypress Lawn. Investigation Accident Investigation Report: Diagram of the instrument approach procedure and crash site The Civil Aeronautics Board investigated the accident. The investigation began immediately after the wreckage was located in the mountainous area southwest of San Francisco, about seven and a half miles southeast of the town of Half Moon Bay. The aircraft was almost entirely destroyed by impact and ensuing fire. It had initially struck the top of several large redwood trees, shearing off one of its landing gear and leaving it hung in an oak. It then continued across a narrow ravine and crashed against the side of a steeply rising slope approximately half a mile beyond the first tree strike. The main wreckage area was at about above sea level. The landing gear was down and locked at the time of impact. There was no evidence of mechanical or structural failure prior to the impact. The accident site was between the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker and the San Francisco ILS Outer Marker, and it appeared that the flight had not maintained at least on top of clouds between those points but had descended in weather conditions which precluded reference to the ground. In addition, the flight had reported being over the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker at 8:39 am and then \\"Southeast, turning inbound\\" at about 8:42 am. In this time interval it would not have been possible for the flight at normal speed to have flown from the Half Moon Bay Outer Marker to the ILS Outer Marker, make the required turn and return to the site of the crash in accordance with Civil Aeronautics Authority approved instrument approach procedure. Thus it was likely that when the pilot reported he was \\"Southeast, turning inbound\\", he was in fact southwest of the airport. The investigation then stated it was probable that the captain, after reporting he was over Half Moon Bay, either saw the terrain momentarily through an unreported break in the overcast foggy conditions or because of a radio navigational error became convinced his position was farther northeast and started to descend over what he believed was the proper area. It was therefore concluded that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of the crew to follow prescribed procedures for an instrument approach. Memorials The plaque commemorating the victims of the crash in El Corte de Madera Creek Open Space Preserve. Today, the crash site is part of the El Corte de Madera Creek Open Space Preserve, which includes the \\"Resolution Trail\\", named for the plane. Park rules restrict visitors to the trail and visitors are also requested to respect this historical site by leaving any artifacts where they find them. Over fifty people attended a plaque's dedication on June 27, 2009, near the junction of the Fir & Vista Point trails, near Vista Point - the site of where a military H-19 'Chickasaw' recovery helicopter landed on the day of the crash. The latest remembrance day was the 65th. anniversary of the crash, held on October 29th., 2018. Visiting the plaque that day was the brother of co-pilot Campbell, Alan Campbell, who had flown in from Cairns, Australia. He placed an Australian flag before the granite memorial and made a somber visit to the impact point. References Further reading Fyshwick, Australia. pp. 200\\\\.

He is best remembered for his eleven-volume Etudes sur l'Histoire d'Ha√Øti (Studies on the History of Haiti), published in the 1850s and 60s.The first volume is available at this link: http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k828725 His Etudes have served as a valuable resource for later historians. Beaubrun Ardouin also wrote the first Haitian textbook, G√©ographie de l'Ile d'Ha√Øti (Geography of the Island of Haiti) and Instruction sur le Jury. Ardouin's historical writing attempted to put the Haitian Revolution in the context of other nationalist revolutions in the Americas. He was a man of Euro-African ancestry, from a family that was free before the revolution. He has been criticized by 20th-century scholars for championing free people of color as the leaders both of the revolution and of post-independence Haiti. The historian Thomas Madiou, who sought to repair the reputation of the great black heroes of the Haitian revolution, especially Toussaint Louverture, and to portray the revolution as a successful slave uprising instead of as a national independence movement, is often cited as Ardouin's intellectual opponent.See the work for David Nicchols and Colin Dayan on this debate among nineteenth-century Haitian historians. Historian and writer H√©nock Trouillot describes the conflict between nineteenth-century Haitian historians in more complex terms in his biography of Ardouin, claiming that Ardouin lacked historical resources to assess the significance of Louverture. Trouillot also describes Ardouin's intense involvement in Haitian politics in the 1840s and his exile to Paris.Beaubrun Ardouin, H√©nock Trouillot, 1950. https://books.google.com/books?id=UdU6MwEACAAJ&dq;=h%C3%A9nock+trouillot+ardouin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=wt5WU9i_KsjPsASmkYDYBA&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAA While in Paris, Ardouin was responsible for editing and publishing Emeric Bergeaud's novel Stella with Dentu in 1859, one year after Bergeaud's death. The novel is widely known as Haiti's first and portrays the Haitian Revolution as a movement demonstrating the unity of Haitian citizens and the importance of the formation of Haiti as an antislavery state.Emeric Bergeaud, Stella, Paris: Dentu, 1859. A digitized version of its 2nd edition is located here: http://www.dloc.com/UF00089373/00001?search=stella. A translated critical edition is forthcoming with NYU Press, edited and translated by Lesley S. Curtis and Christen Mucher. Beaubrun Ardouin was elected Senator in 1832 and served on the Council of Secretaries of State in 1845. Growing up during the revolutionary period, Beaubrun Ardouin was not able to attend school regularly; he was self-taught. He had a strong interest in French literature, especially the works of Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Ardouin's brothers, C√©ligny and Coriolan, were also well-known; C√©ligny as a politician and historian, Coriolan as a poet. The three Ardouin brothers, along with the Nau brothers, Emile and Ignace, were members of the literary society \\"The School of 1836,\\" which was founded by Ignace Nau. Coriolan died young in 1836, while C√©ligny ran afoul of Faustin-√âlie Soulouque's government and was executed in 1849. Beaubrun published C√©ligny's Essais sur l'Histoire d'Ha√Øti (English: Essays on the History of Haiti) in 1865, just before his own death.

The building stands at the intersection of Eugenie Street and Cleveland Avenue. The church was built as a haven for German immigrants who were outcasts in Old Chicago. In addition, the town's main church, St. Joseph's Church, was overcrowded. The Redemptorists were invited to administer the parish in 1860 and a large brick church was finished in 1869. When completed, its tower made it the tallest building in Chicago and the United States, a distinction it held until the old Chicago Board of Trade Building was completed in 1885. History The church was one of seven buildings to 'survive' the path of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, albeit heavily damaged. While most of Old Chicago's infrastructure was made of wood, the church was made of brick which helped it survive the fire. Portions of the building survived‚Äîthe stone walls of St. Michael's being the only structures standing in the Old Town area. The church was quickly rebuilt.

Washington New Technology High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, is a high school named after the educational pioneer Booker T. Washington. Caddo Parish Public Schools operates the school. History In 1945, educational facilities for blacks were reported by community activists and students to have been in \\"deplorable\\" condition. Construction of a new high school was proposed as a solution to the matter. Enrollments were overcrowded at Central Colored High School and the Milam Street Trade School. Booker T. Washington High School was born at a site across from the trade school. Completed in 1949, it was named for the founder of Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 2015, Booker T. Washington was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. (with 52 photos and four maps ) The Milam Street Trade School became a junior high school when Booker T. Washington High School opened on January 23, 1950. Booker T. Washington High School was considered a model school for blacks, being featured in the October 1950 issue of Life magazine. In the October 1950 Life Magazine feature, the school was highlighted for its innovative architecture, accommodations for traditional academics, and career, technical, and industrial education programs. Built at a cost of $1,514,065 for the physical plant and $500,000 for equipment, Booker T. Washington became one of the most modern schools in Louisiana, having individual lockers for all students, central heating, movable desks, modern laboratories, administrative offices, asphalt tile floors, and fluorescent lighting. A massive renovation took place in 1991; another remodeling to facilities occurred in July 2014 after a fire damaged the main wing. An additional 3,000 capacity gymnasium complete with health classrooms, a laundry area, as well as dressing rooms for both the home and opposing teams was completed in the fall of 2006. The girls basketball team became in 1989 the first in northwestern Louisiana to win a state championship. The team would repeatedly win Class 4A championships in 1990 and again in 1991. The men's basketball team won its first LHSAA Class 4A championship in 1973. The school hosted coaches such as Leonard \\"Jitterbug\\" Barnes and George T. Brown, and continues to be prominent in both athletics and academics. Traditions at Booker T. Washington High School include the annual Soul Bowl, featuring the Booker T. Washington High School Lions and the Green Oaks Giants; and baccalaureate services for graduating seniors. Academics The initial curriculum offered basic high school/college prep academic courses in English, literature, music, social science, health, general science, biology, algebra, geometry, chemistry, and physical education, as well as numerous vocational courses to supplement the work at the Milam Street Trade School. New vocational courses included commercial baking, laundry and dry cleaning processes, typing, shorthand and bookkeeping, auto mechanics (including machine body and fender repair), masonry and cement work, graphic arts, carpentry, electrical name mechanics, sheet metal working, pottery and clay, landscape gardening and hot-house horticulture, leather- craft, home laundry, cooking, sewing, needle-craft, shoe-craft, and beauty culture (later cosmetology). In the fall of 2011, Booker T. Washington added seventh and eighth grades to its original 9‚Äì12 configuration. Seventh and eighth grades are no longer part of the configuration as of 2017, when Fair Park High School became a middle school, merging its 9-12 population with Booker T. Washington. Enrollment now tops 1,100 students. The school incorporates an intensive technology focus into the core subjects of math, science, English/language arts and social studies, through the use of grant funded laboratories and technology. Teachers currently participate in the Teacher Advancement Program Model. By the spring of 2013, Booker T. Washington High School had made enough academic progress to be removed from the state \\"Academically Unacceptable\\" list on which it had been included for the preceding seven years. The school currently offers three magnet programs to eligible students in Caddo Parish: telecommunications, barbering, and cosmetology. Booker T. Washington High School is currently accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which is recognized as a regional accrediting agency by the United States Department of Education. Booker T. Washington first gained accreditation in 1961 and will be up for renewal in 2019. Athletics Students at Booker T. Washington participate in the following athletic programs.

Al- Mina (Arabic: \\"the port\\") is the modern name given by Leonard Woolley to an ancient trading post on the Mediterranean coast of northern Syria, in the estuary of the Orontes River, near Samandaƒü, in Hatay Province of Turkey. Archaeology The site was excavated in 1936 by Leonard Woolley, who considered it to be an early Greek trading colony, founded a little before 800 BC, in direct competition with the Phoenicians to the south. He argued that substantial amounts of Greek pottery at the site established its early Euboean connections, while the Syrian and Phoenician cooking pottery reflected a cultural mix typical of an emporium. Disappointed in not finding a Bronze-Age port, Woolley soon moved his interests to the earlier, more urbane site of Alalakh. Woolley's critics point out that he discarded coarse undecorated utilitarian wares, and that the relative numbers of Greek, Syrian and Phoenician populations have not been established.Lehmann (2005) The controversy whether Al Mina is to be regarded as a native Syrian site, with Syrian architecture and cooking pots and a Greek presence, or as an Iron Age Greek trading post, has not been resolved.R. Kearsley, \\"Greeks Overseas in the 8th Century B.C.: Euboeans, Al Mina and Assyrian Imperialism,\\"; J. Boardman, \\"The Excavated History of Al Mina,\\" in Ancient Greeks West and East, ed. G. Tsetskhladze (Leiden, Boston, 1999); Waldbaum (1997) Al-Mina has been largely overlooked in popular surveys.Such as Eric M. Meyers (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Archaeology in the Near East 1997, which barely makes passing reference Later work considered Al-Mina as key to understanding the role of early Greeks in the east at the outset of the Orientalizing period of Greek cultural history. Woolley identified Al-Mina with Herodotus' Posideion, but more recent scholarship places Posideion at Ras al-Bassit.Waldbaum (1997), Lane Fox (2008) remarks on the frequency of Posideion as a Greek placename along coastlines. Robin Lane FoxLane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer 2008:97ff has made a case for the Greek name of the site to have been the Potamoi Karon that is mentioned in Diodorus Siculus'Diodorus Siculus, 19.79.6 account of Ptolemy I Soter's ravaging of the coastline in 312 BC; he notes its unusual word order and suggestively links it to karu, \\"trading post\\", in the inscription text of Tiglath-Pileser III's conquests, which would give \\"River(s) of the Trading Posts\\".Lane Fox gives as a parallel the Greek Koile Syria, which A. Schalit (1954) and M. Sartre (1988) correctly identified as a Greek transcription of Aramaic kul, \\"whole, entire\\" (Lane Fox 2008: notes to ch. 7, p 378f). Woolley, on separate grounds, dated the final extinction of the Al-Mina settlement to the late fourth century BC, perhaps damaged during construction of the port of Seleucia Pieria just to the north. Lane Fox suggests instead this same voyage of coastal destruction was undertaken by Ptolemy in 312 BC. Significance Al-Mina served as an outpost for cultural influences that accompanied trade with Urartu and the shortest caravan route to Assyrian cities of upper Mesopotamia.The impact of north Syrian techniques and objects on Greek craftsmen of the 8th and 7th centuries in Aegean islands and the mainland had already been established, for example, in F. Poulsen, Der Orient und der fr√ºgriechischen Kunst 1912, as noted by Lane Fox 2008:99 note 5. Through Al-Mina and Greek traders in CyprusGreek traders are also present at Tarsos and somewhat later at Tell Sukas, see Burkert (1992), p. 11. the Phoenician alphabet and other technology were transmitted to Euboea and mainland Greece in the eighth century BC.Burkert (1992) Al-Mina was destroyed about 700 BC, perhaps by Sennacherib, who repressed a rebellion at Tarsos in 696 BC, but it was immediately rebuilt. Pottery recovered from later levels of the site shows that a Greek presence remained at Al-Mina through to the fourth century BC, with pottery imported from Miletus and deftly imitated locally, apparently by Greek potters.

Plot A young interracial couple is hospitalized after the husband, Jeremy, attacks robbers who threaten his wife, Tracy. Her airway closes and she collapses, apparently experiencing anaphylaxis. Dr. House, however, is distracted by the sight of Dr. Wilson chatting to an attractive new nurse, Wendy, in the hallway; House is convinced that Wilson is dating her. Chase suggests that Tracy and Jeremy have smoked marijuana tainted with salmonella, so House orders treatment with fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Tracy develops a rash in response to this antibiotic, so House extrapolates that the anxiety of being attacked caused Tracy to secrete too much adrenaline and go into an exercise-triggered anaphylaxis. While Foreman tests this hypothesis by having her run on a treadmill, Jeremy becomes angry and begins experiencing chest and stomach pain. The team wonders whether to attribute their common stomach pain to a shared infection or a shared environment. Upon inspecting their small apartment, Chase and Foreman find only a package of condoms. Meanwhile, House sees a patient named Michael Tritter (David Morse) during his clinic hours. When House refuses to run tests on Tritter's rash, attributing it to dehydration, a confrontation ensues. Tritter trips House, House swabs the rash, and House leaves Tritter with a thermometer inserted in his rectum while House leaves for the day. While discussing Tracy and Jeremy's case, House breaks into Wendy's locker and guesses that a jazz festival flier in a locker full of novels means that she is indulging Wilson's interest in jazz. He bets Foreman $200 that the nurse and Wilson are in a relationship. House takes Tracy off the steroids, reasoning that, if she develops a fever, the problem is an infection and that, if she doesn't, the problem is environmental. Tracy experiences a hallucination of Jeremy's late father, who was violently opposed to their relationship; she screams. Foreman arrives to find her lapsing into a dissociative coma. After comparing Tracy's MRI to Jeremy's earlier chest X-ray, House suspects sarcoidosis and tells the team to perform a brainstem biopsy for confirmation. Concerned about the procedure's risks to Tracy and the potential conflict of interest in asking Jeremy to consent on her behalf, Cameron asks Cuddy to have a guardian ad litem represent Tracy. Tracy's condition worsens too quickly so Wilson is asked to present Jeremy with the options. Jeremy requests that they withdraw his treatment so that they can biopsy him, instead. Cuddy calls House to her office, where clinic patient Tritter is waiting. Tritter demands an apology from House, but House flatly refuses and leaves the office. Meanwhile, Jeremy's condition has worsened; but, instead of brain swelling, his lactic acid levels are rising, which should mean his intestines have begun to rot. House speculates that he and Tracy do not share the same disease, after all. He orders that Tracy be treated for porphyria and that Jeremy's bowel be biopsied. Foreman discovers that Jeremy's bowels are not rotting at all. House learns that Jeremy and Tracy grew up as neighbors and ran off at age 16 to escape Jeremy's father and his opposition to the relationship. House muses on Tracy's and Jeremy's green eyes and realizes that they share hereditary angioedema, a rare hereditary condition that prevents their bodies from producing a vital protein, and that they are probably half-siblings. House orders Foreman to tell them. Reluctantly, Foreman does so. Tracy reacts badly. Later, Chase (Jesse Spencer) asks Foreman (Omar Epps) to cover some of his weekend on-call hours; but Foreman refuses, saying evasively that he is going out of town. When Foreman admits he is going to a jazz festival with the new nurse, House reluctantly pays him the $200. As Foreman leaves, he sees that Tracy has moved out of the hospital room she shared with Jeremy, so Foreman stays with the devastated young man for a while. Meanwhile, Cuddy is observed with a pregnancy test, which, to her dismay, reads negative. House speeds home on his motorcycle. He is pulled over by a police officer who turns out to be Michael Tritter. Tritter arrests him for possession of narcotics.  Trivia  After stopping House for speeding, officer Tritter reasons that House is under the influence of narcotics, based on his observation that House's pupils are dilated. House, however, uses Vicodin, a hydrocodone-containing drug which, if anything, would cause pupillary constriction (miosis).http://www.rxlist.com/zohydro-er- drug/clinical-pharmacology.htmhttp://www.news-medical.net/health/Opioid-Side- Effects.aspx  Music  *Walter Reed by Michael Penn References External links *FOX.com-House official site *\\"House M.D.\\" IMDB Profile Category:House (season 3) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes fr:L'Amour de sa vie ","title":"Fools for Love"},{"id":"7720140","text":"Albert Gallatin was a U.S. Revenue Cutter that grounded on Boo Hoo Ledge off Manchester, MA on 6 January 1892.

The film has little plot to speak of, but is instead divided into three short episodes, each of which opens with a man desperately running away before being trapped in a dead end, where something out-of-the-ordinary occurs. The episodes include a musical number, a Mexican stand-off and a police pursuit. Plot The first episode begins with an extended scene showing a man desperately running through an urban landscape, before coming to a dead end in a dark backstreet ally. When he hears approaching footsteps, he attacks his presumed pursuer with a metal bar. He is shocked to find that he has instead killed a young woman. However, the woman comes back to life, and sings and dances with the man in the style of a musical film, telling him how they were fated to meet and how tragic it is that their love has to be so short. Once again she dies, and while the man grieves over her body, his pursuer appears and shoots him. The man's and woman's bodies lie next to each other on the tarmac. The second episode also begins with a fleeing man who gets trapped in a dead end, where he becomes involved in a protracted Mexican stand-off with another man. The scene is intercut with a similar stand-off involving two different armed men in the same location. Both stand-offs end with the two protagonists laughing at their predicament and entering a friendly embrace, before trying to shoot the other man. All the men receive gunshot wounds and die, their bodies falling in positions similar to the couple in the first episode of the film. The third episode starts with three police officers chasing a suspect. The suspect flees to the top of a tall building, where a young woman is sitting. The edge of the roof is, in effect, a dead end. The suspect takes the woman hostage. After a stand-off, she manages to take the suspect's gun, and to everyone's surprise points it at her own head, threatening suicide. When the suspect tries to knock the gun out of her hand, they fall together from the roof. Although they expect to die, they actually land in a lorry carrying a cargo of feathers. The episode ends with the couple lying together in a similar physical position to the couples in the previous episodes, except that this time both characters are still alive.

Prior to 1875, Hoyne had led a political career in which he had occupied numerous state and municipal offices. Life and career Hoyne moved to Chicago in 1837, where he turned his back on the mercantile life he had been leading and studied law, being admitted to the bar in 1839. He was elected Chicago city clerk in 1840.Carter, Orrin N. ‚ÄúThe Early Courts of Chicago and Cook County.‚Äù Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, vol. 7, no. 2, 1914, pp. 7‚Äì38.

In 1863, Hoyne traveled to New York and then to Boston to acquire a lens for a telescope for the University of Chicago. In Boston, he met with Alvan Clark and purchased an 18¬Ω-inch lens and mounting for the Dearborn Observatory, at the time, the largest refracting telescope ever built. By 1866, he became one of the founding members of the Chicago Astronomical Society and served as the organization's secretary. Following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Hoyne presided at the meeting that established a free library in Chicago and sat upon its board of directors, eventually writing the first history of the Chicago library system. In 1875, the city of Chicago adopted the Cities and Villages Act of 1872, which called for municipal elections to be held in April, instead of November. Harvey Doolittle Colvin, the current mayor, was informed by his attorneys that his term should be considered extended to the new elections. While the charter did not explicitly extend his term, it also failed to include the office of mayor in a call for special elections to fill the period from November to May. =Mayoral race= In April 1876 there was an election and neither the Republicans nor the Democrats nominated anyone for mayor. Running as an independent, Hoyne received 33,064 of the 40,000 votes cast for mayor and was declared the Mayor of Chicago. Colvin, however, refused to relinquish the office and was supported by the city comptroller. Although Hoyne presided over council meetings and gave an inaugural address, the Circuit Court declared his election null and void. Colvin continued to serve until the courts called for a special election on July 12, 1876. =Death and legacy= Hoyne was killed in a July 27, 1883 railroad collision on the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg railroad near Carlton StationChicago's Mayors: A Collection of Biographies Of All Chicago‚Äôs Mayors by Elaine C.

It is the third in a tetralogy of novels beginning with Love Medicine that explores the interrelated lives of four Anishinaabe families living on an Indian reservation near the fictional town of Argus, North Dakota. Within the saga, Tracks is earliest chronologically, providing the back-story of several characters such as Lulu Lamartine and Marie Kashpaw who become prominent in the other novels. As in many of her other novels, Erdrich employs the use of multiple first-person narratives to relate the events of the plot, alternating between Nanapush, a tribal patriarch, and Pauline, a young girl of mixed heritage. Plot Tracks alternates between two narrators: Nanapush, a jovial tribal elder, and Pauline, a young girl of mixed heritage. In Nanapush's chapters the point of view is that of Nanapush telling stories to his granddaughter, Lulu, several years after the main events in the novel occur. When Lulu was ten years old, her mother, Fleur Pillager, sent her away to a government school. Because of this, Lulu is now estranged from her mother. Nanapush, therefore, narrates the story in attempt to reconcile mother and daughter by telling Lulu about the events between 1912 and 1924 that led Fleur to her decision. Nanapush first meets Fleur in 1912 when he rescues her in the middle of winter and nurses her back to health from consumption ‚Äì a recent epidemic among the Anishinaabe. Because of their shared grief at losing so many from their community, Nanapush and Fleur develop a friendship and begin to see one another as family. The next year, Fleur goes to the nearby town of Argus and takes a job at a butcher's shop, where she meets Pauline Puyat ‚Äì the novel's second narrator. After beating a group of men from the shop one night at a game of poker, Fleur is beaten and raped. She leaves town, but the next day a tornado strikes Argus. Mysteriously, no one in town is harmed in the storm with the exception of the men who raped her ‚Äì whose bodies are found locked in the freezer of the butcher shop, where they had taken refuge. Fleur returns to her family home on the reservation, where she meets Eli Kashpaw while hunting in the woods one day. Much to his mother's dismay, Eli falls in love with Fleur and moves in with her. Soon, Fleur begins to show signs that she is pregnant and, although the true paternity is unknown, Eli takes responsibility of the child as his own. A new family unit begins to form at the Pillager home ‚Äì Fleur, Eli and their daughter, Lulu, as well as Eli's mother, Margaret, and her second son, Nector. Throughout the novel, Margaret and Nanapush, whom Fleur regards as a father, also develop an intimate relationship. Together, the family faces trials of hunger, tribal conflict, and ultimately the loss of their land to the government. In the meantime, Pauline has also left Argus. She stays with a widow named Bernadette Morrissey, from whom she learns the art of tending the sick and dying. She stays in Argus and visits Nanapush and the family home as an unwanted guest. Pauline serves as a midwife to Fleur during an early birth. She becomes increasingly jealous of Fleur and her relationship, and in an attempt to break them up, feeds a sort of love potion to Eli and a younger girl named Sophie, inducing them to copulate passionately in the forest. Claiming to have received a vision, she decides to join a convent, where she only delves further into obsession. She devotes herself to the cause of converting Fleur and the others, but is generally regarded as a nuisance. She develops several unusual habits as a means of self-inflicting suffering to remind herself of Christ's suffering. Her behaviors are frowned upon by the superior nun, and she is eventually sent away to teach mathematics at a Catholic school. Pauline's narratives deal with her own personal story and also provide a second perspective on many of the same events described by Nanapush. Major themes =Traditional beliefs vs. Christianity= One major theme in Tracks is the tension between traditional Anishinaabe culture and beliefs and the Westernizing influence of white, Christian America. This clash can clearly be seen in the two characters of Fleur and Pauline; as Michelle R. Hessler writes, \\"Fleur upholds the traditions of her ancestors and attempts to save their land from the rapid advance of white civilization, whereas Pauline enters a cloister, denies her Native American heritage, and brings death and destruction to the reservation.\\" =Narrative structure= Contradictions, lies, and \\"double-voiced-ness\\" have also been identified as major themes in Tracks by some critics. As the plot unfolds, the narrator Nanapush is able to use his gift of speech to negotiate with government representatives on behalf of his people, but he often tells contradictory stories and even outright lies. Similarly, Pauline's narrative is unreliable and often contradictory. Some critics view Nanapush as a reliable narrator. As critic Susan Stanford Friedman argues, \\"the novel overtly sets up a contrast between Nanapush as the reliable narrator who retains his Anishinabe religion and the unreliable narrator, the convert Pauline whose self-hatred takes the form of a denial of her Indian heritage and the adoption of a self-destructive Catholicism.\\" Nanapush is a critical character in the tension between the Anishinaabe and the whites because of his trickster qualities and ability to navigate both sides of the conflict through talking. Anishinaabe scholar Lawrence W. Gross points out that Nanapush's association with the mythical figure Nanabozho helps him to survive by enabling him to adapt white culture to his own traditions and interests, arguing that \\"it is the tricksters who survive to build a new world on the ashes of the old.\\" Literary critic Sheila Hassel Hughes further expands on this notion by commenting on Nanapush's duplicitous speech, which, \\"like that of the prophet or the trickster, works simultaneously to undermine the power of the privileged oppressor and to appeal for his or her re-alignment on the side of the oppressed.\\" Maria DePriest also points out that, while Fleur is obviously the central character in the book, she does not get to narrate her own story. Fleur must battle two fronts - not only the external conflict of white America that threatens to take away her ancestral land, but also internal betrayals from her own people ‚Äì but her story is told at a distance by Nanapush and Pauline, both of whom are unreliable narrators. =Hauntings and madness= Fleur has been described as \\"one of the most haunting presences in contemporary American literature\\", and Tracks is also characterized by the theme of haunting. Fleur is described as having mystical, shamanistic powers and at one point even travels to the spirit world to negotiate for the life of her second child. Several references are made to the manitou (including Misshepeshu, the lake spirit who is said to be a guardian of the Pillager family) and the windigo. For instance, in the first chapter of the novel, Nanapush describes his and Fleur's descent into grief at the loss of so many of their people to consumption, saying, \\"We had gone half windigo. I learned later that this was common, that there were many of our people who died in this manner, of the invisible sickness. There were those who could not swallow another bite of food because the names of their dead anchored their tongues.\\" Their grief is characterized as a gripping depression, verging on madness. Madness itself is also a motif in the novel ‚Äì manifesting most notably in the characters of Pauline (with her masochistic self-mortification methods) and Fleur (particularly following the death of her second child). Beidler notes that madness is associated with the characters' emotional distress at the destruction of their environment by the white logging company. Development history Tracks is part of a cycle of books all set in the same fictional community and dealing with many of the same characters and families ‚Äì the Kashpaws, Pillagers, and Morrisseys. Other books in the saga include Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, The Bingo Palace, Four Souls and The Painted Drum. Tales of Burning Love, which features Sister Leopolda (Pauline), is also loosely related. Erdrich's method of writing these related histories of families from the same community has been compared to William Faulkner and his creation of Yoknapatawpha County. After her success with Love Medicine and The Beet Queen, Erdrich was unsure of what to write about next. She had a 400-page manuscript that was to be the foundation for Tracks, but regarded it as her \\"burden\\". With the help of her husband, Michael Dorris, she decided she could use the story to continue the saga of Love Medicine and The Beet Queen. =Publication history= The first edition of Tracks was published in 1988, but several of its chapters had been published previously as short stories. These include: *Chapter Two: Originally published as \\"Fleur\\" in Esquire in August, 1986. This chapter, narrated by Pauline, relates the events of Fleur's rape in Argus. *Chapter Five: Narrated by Nanapush, this chapter deals with the aftermath of Eli's infidelity with Sophie, and was originally published as \\"Snares\\" in Harper's, May 1987 and in Best American Short Stories, 1988. *Chapters One and Three: Originally published together as \\"Matchimanito\\" in The Atlantic in May 1988. In these chapters, Nanapush tells the story of the beginnings of his relationship with Fleur - how he rescued her from the sickness, helped Eli to woo her, and adopted Lulu as his granddaughter. Reception Tracks received mixed reviews at the time of its publication, with most critics identifying Erdrich's vivid language and narrative structure as either effective or not. R.Z. Sheppard criticized Erdrich's use of alternating narratives as too \\"schematic\\" and forced ‚Äì and characterized her graphic descriptions as too \\"grandiose\\". \\"Crammed into a short, intense novel\\", Sheppard wrote, \\"her characters are too busy hauling symbolic freight to reveal their humanity.\\" Similarly, The New Statesman and Society criticized the novel for being too vivid and heavy- handed with language, writing, \\"[Erdrich's] linguistic profusion veers toward sentimentalizing a people and their history.\\" In The New York Times Book Review, Jean Strouse found Tracks to be \\"a bit more didactic and wrought\\" than Erdrich's previous novels, and more political as well. She also highlighted concerns over whether or not Tracks could even be considered a true novel, since four of its nine chapters had been previously published as short stories ‚Äì including one, \\"Snares\\", which was controversially published in Best American Short Stories, an anthology that claims it does not admit novel excerpts. Nonetheless, Strouse also praised Erdrich for \\"centering on life instead of self\\" in the novel, and called Tracks \\"a welcome contrast\\" to much of mainstream 1980s fiction. Other reviewers responded positively to the novel, including Barbara Hoffert, who called it \\"splendid\\", and wrote that Erdrich's prose is \\"as sharp, glittering, and to the point as cut glass.\\" Christopher Vecsey, in Commonweal, compared her writing to the magical realism employed by writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Andrew Welsh-Huggins placed her in the company of contemporary writers like Anne Tyler, John Updike and Toni Morrison. The reviewer for Choice compared her writing style to William Faulkner, identified by Erdrich as one of her favorite authors.

Upon her entry into the Southeast Asia combat zone on 3 April 1971, Meyerkord became the first ship named after an American serviceman killed in the Vietnam War to return to act in a supporting role. She participated in an ASW exercise in the Indian Ocean with the ASW group. Meyerkord returned to Long Beach in July 1971. Meyerkord began her second deployment on 25 July 1972. After transiting to Subic Bay, Meyerkord was independently assigned to Naval Gunfire Support duties. During this seven-month deployment, Meyerkord acted as a mutual support destroyer in three separate assignments involving gunfire support. On 16 October 1973, Meyerkord began her first regular overhaul in Long Beach. In addition to general maintenance, the ship received several significant alterations. These included modifications to the ship's sonar, the addition of the Basic Point Defense Missile system, and alterations to the hangar to accommodate a manned helicopter (as opposed to the unmanned Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH). Meyerkord reported to her new homeport, San Diego, California, in July 1974. On 3 January 1975, Meyerkord departed San Diego for her third WESTPAC deployment. After arrival at Subic Bay, the ship answered a distress signal from Gulf Banker, a sinking Panamanian registered merchant ship. Meyerkord rescued 31 ship's crew members and monitored Gulf Banker until it sank to ensure it would not become a hazard to navigation. Meyerkord participated in the evacuations of Cambodia and Vietnam as well as fleet towing exercises and a joint exercise with the Royal Thai Navy.

They mounted an eight-round ASROC launcher between the 5-inch (127 mm) gun and the bridge. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two twin Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The ships were equipped with a torpedo- carrying DASH drone helicopter; its telescoping hangar and landing pad were positioned amidships aft of the mack. Beginning in the 1970s, the DASH was replaced by a SH-2 Seasprite LAMPS I helicopter and the hangar and landing deck were accordingly enlarged. Most ships also had the 3-inch (76 mm) gun replaced by an eight-cell BPDMS missile launcher in the early 1970s.Friedman, pp. 360‚Äì61; Gardiner, Chumley & Budzbon, p. 598 Service history On 17 October 1989, hours after the Loma Prieta earthquake, Lang left Treasure Island for Hunters Point, where she provided wet steam to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

The turnpike forms a partial beltway around the south and east sides of Tulsa, Oklahoma's second largest city. The Creek Turnpike's western terminus is at the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, while its northeastern terminus is at the Will Rogers Turnpike in Fair Oaks; both ends of the Creek Turnpike connect with Interstate 44 (I-44). Along the way, the highway passes through the cities of Sapulpa, Jenks, Tulsa, and Broken Arrow, and the counties of Creek, Tulsa, Wagoner and Rogers. The road is maintained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA), except for a brief free section shared with U.S. Route 64 (US-64) and US-169. This free section is maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT). The first section of the Creek Turnpike, from US-75 in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first authorized in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along the route of the highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands and endangered species being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, over the course of the first half of 1992. Further extensions to both the east and the west followed in later years after several years of false starts under the administrations of two different governors. Expansion of the highway was finally approved in 1998. The extension to the west, linking the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, opened December 15, 2000. The extension to the east opened in three parts over the course of 2001 and 2002. Flat-rate tolls are collected at three mainline toll plazas along the turnpike, as well as at several entrances and exits. Both cash and the Pikepass electronic toll collection system are accepted as payment. Route description Map of Creek Turnpike (bright red) through the Tulsa metro area The Creek Turnpike begins at I-44 (Turner Turnpike) exit 217 in the city of Sapulpa. This interchange only provides access from eastbound I-44 to the Creek Turnpike and from the Creek Turnpike to westbound I-44. The turnpike runs in a general southeast direction from this terminus towards the Creek‚ÄìTulsa county line, crossing over Polecat Creek. Upon crossing into Tulsa County, the toll road turns to a more easterly course. The highway enters Jenks less than one mile (approximately 1.6 km) east of the county line. In Jenks, the highway has a modified cloverleaf interchange at US-75; the westbound Turnpike to southbound US-75 ramp is a directional ramp rather than a loop ramp. The Creek Turnpike then passes through the first of three barrier toll plazas. Near the interchange with Elm Street (signed as \\"Peoria‚ÄìElm\\"; Elm Street is named Peoria Avenue outside of Jenks), the highway bridges Polecat Creek again, before crossing the Arkansas River into Tulsa. In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an interchange at Memorial Drive, which carries US-64 south of the toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway. US-169 also begins at this interchange, heading north from here toward its other end in Virginia, Minnesota. As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering Broken Arrow, where it crosses over Haikey Creek. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns back east. In southeast Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike crosses the county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, followed by the Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through the third and final barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner‚ÄìRogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway. Exit numbers are absent along the Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange, which is numbered as exit 28. Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange, continuing until the highway's terminus (exits 33A‚ÄìB). The Creek Turnpike's exit numbering is used for the final two exits on the westbound Will Rogers Turnpike‚Äîthe westbound-only Pine Street exit (exit 35) and the westbound I-44 ramp (exit 34). The entirety of the Creek Turnpike has been recognized as important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by its inclusion in the National Highway System. In 2011, the highest average annual daily traffic (AADT) count was 26,900 vehicles eastbound and 26,476 vehicles westbound between the Yale Avenue and Memorial Drive interchanges. The lowest AADT counts, 4,426 vehicles eastbound and 4,463 vehicles westbound, were recorded between the 11th Street interchange and the northeastern terminus. Law enforcement along the Creek Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop XE, a special troop assigned to the turnpike. History Signage at exit 31 =Planning for the first segment= As early as the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system included a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had plans to build a toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117. A south Tulsa turnpike was first authorized by OTA in 1987, the same time as three other turnpikes that would ultimately become the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and John Kilpatrick turnpikes. Eleven possible routings were researched before OTA settled on the 96th Street corridor as the site of the proposed turnpike. On February 16, 1989, OTA sold $558.4 million in revenue bonds (about $ in dollars) to cover the cost of all four proposed turnpikes. As originally planned, the Creek Turnpike was to begin at US-75 and end at Memorial Drive, for a total length of . ODOT would then build a $26 million (approximately $ in dollars) freeway connection from the eastern terminus of the turnpike at Memorial Drive to tie in with the south end of the Mingo Valley Expressway. OTA intended the turnpike to be built on a \\"fast track\\", with construction to be complete by the close of 1991. The estimated cost to construct this first segment of the Creek Turnpike was $85 million (about $ in dollars). Initially, the highway was planned to have an median with a Jersey barrier, which would meet minimum AASHTO requirements of . Later plans expanded this to a grass median. Four toll plazas were planned, with one mainline plaza collecting a fifty-cent toll no matter what distance was traveled. =Tulsa requests changes= Tulsa mayor Rodger Randle's committee on the Creek Turnpike submitted a report to OTA on April 13, 1989, requesting that the agency make 47 changes to the turnpike. Among the changes proposed by the city was a shift in the route of to the north between Yale Avenue and Sheridan Road to accommodate a greenway along both sides of the turnpike. The committee also recommended wider overpasses to accommodate future expansion of surface streets such as Delaware Avenue, moving the mainline toll plaza farther east to minimize impact on the surrounding area, and better compliance with local flood prevention ordinances. In addition, the report suggested better pedestrian access, including pedestrian bridges on both sides of the Arkansas River and near Hunter Park, and various sidewalks and pedestrian tunnels. OTA immediately agreed that some of the more minor changes to the turnpike's plans could be made, but expressed doubt that more major alterations would be made. Several of the proposed changes, including the greenway, were highlighted as major expenses. Nonetheless, OTA agreed to evaluate the city's proposals. Board member (and future Tulsa mayor) Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr., said \\"We are not set in stone, but it's a matter of economics.\\" Mayor Randle stated his desire for a written agreement regarding the changes to be drawn up and signed by the city and OTA before ground was broken on the turnpike. On June 18, 1989, OTA officials announced that the majority of the city's proposed amendments to the Creek Turnpike would be incorporated into the design. The alterations added $6 million (about $ in dollars) to the cost of the project. However, the revised plan required the demolition of only 41 houses, six fewer than originally planned. Further alterations were negotiated throughout the latter half of 1989, with OTA and Tulsa reaching an agreement on December 29. The plans were adapted to include flood and noise control provisions. To meet these requirements, the highway would be lowered, with some sections below-grade. In exchange, the City of Tulsa agreed to pay $1.3 million in annual maintenance costs until 2020. The deal also included a land swap, with the city giving OTA land from Hunter Park and receiving land along the right-of-way to construct recreational trails. =Construction= OTA began filing condemnation suits for homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, the process by which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990. Drainage work was in progress by late February 1990. Construction was underway on turnpike bridges by March 1990. While federal environmental permits were being secured, the construction process was delayed; by October 1990, the bridge construction was only at the point that had been planned to have been completed in May, and grading and paving work had yet to begin. In December 1990, contractors on the Creek Turnpike project were given \\"notice to proceed\\", as the permits had been granted. By that time, construction had only progressed to the point that it was supposed to have been at in late July. Nevertheless, by April 1991, OTA's chief executive officer, Richard Ridings, described the project as \\"moving very well\\" and said \\"My own personal opinion is it's up to the contractors. If they want to produce, it can be open by the end of the year.\\" The first section of the Creek Turnpike to open was a segment from Delaware Avenue to its eastern terminus at Memorial Drive, which opened to traffic at 7 p.m. on March 13, 1992. Tolls were waived until 12:01 a.m. on March 16. The next section to the west, from Elm Street in Jenks to Delaware Avenue, including the Arkansas River bridge, opened the afternoon of April 15. The final leg of the first segment of the turnpike, from US-75 to Elm Street, opened at noon on July 30. The Creek Turnpike was initially posted with a speed limit, due to the National Maximum Speed Limit law then in effect. Traffic levels on the new highway were about double what was expected, with an average of 9,000 vehicles per day using the turnpike in August 1992; a 1988 estimate predicted only 3,000 to 5,000 vehicles would use the road each day. =Opposition= The Creek Turnpike was opposed by area residents from its conception. Forming a group called \\"Tulsans Against Turnpikes\\", around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16, 1989, to discuss the proposed toll road. Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns. \\"What I am concerned about is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa. It would no longer be a residential area,\\" said Tom Taylor, an area resident. Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase. On March 22, 1989, three Will Rogers Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a surprise appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes press conference to offer support to the opposition movement, expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike. The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards. In late June 1989, opponents of the turnpike boycotted local businesses that were members of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, which was in favor of the turnpike. Some turnpike protesters removed their names from the customer list at Mazzio's Italian Eatery on June 23. On June 24, about forty protesters picketed the Bank of Oklahoma, and around six closed their accounts. The chief executives of both businesses were on the board of the Chamber of Commerce. In response to the boycott, Mayor Randle issued a statement accusing Tulsans Against Turnpikes of \\"seeking to wage economic coercion against businesses\\" and described their tactics as \\"[working] as a kind of economic blackmail to silence debate\\", as well as \\"allowing differences of opinion to degenerate into intimidation against those who have taken public stands unpopular with [Tulsans Against Turnpikes]\\". Randle also canceled a planned meeting with the group, refusing to meet with them until they ceased the boycott. A Tulsans Against Turnpikes board member publicly replied to the mayor's statement by denying that a boycott was taking place, stating that the group only recommended that members not do business with Mazzio's and Bank of Oklahoma because of their support for the Creek Turnpike project via their activity with the Chamber of Commerce. He also suggested that Randle was simply looking for an excuse to avoid the meeting. The environmental group Greenpeace became involved with the opposition movement in October 1989. Holding a joint rally with Tulsans Against Turnpikes and several environmental groups at Hunter Park, a Greenpeace spokeswoman said on October 20 that the Creek Turnpike's construction \\"will be setting up Oklahoma as a hazardous waste dumping ground\\". Greenpeace's regional coordinator was scheduled to speak at an area library on the same day, but his appearance was canceled when the organization's bus ran out of fuel. A local resident at the Hunter Park forum was quoted as being concerned that the turnpike may allow eastern states such as New York to ship AIDS-contaminated freight through the area. In November 1989, Jenks resident Gary Medlin and two Jenks city councilmen drafted a letter to OTA requesting that the agency cease all work on the Creek Turnpike. The letter was approved by the Jenks City Council on November 20. The letter also included a petition in opposition to the turnpike with over 1,000 signatures. A grand jury petition, bearing over 1,400 signatures across 134 pages, was filed with the Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined that there was no evidence to support the allegations and no need for further investigation. Some protesters resorted to illegal means to demonstrate their opposition to the project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M. J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M. J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading \\"Death to OTA\\", \\"Death to [Governor Henry] Bellmon\\" and \\"Death to Bartlett\\" (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud on the side of a water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated \\"We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor[...].\\" In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief. Lawsuit The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was exempt from requirements to have a federal environmental impact study (EIS) conducted on the Creek Turnpike project. As part of their opposition to the turnpike, Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right. The group announced in April 1989 that if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies. Tulsans Against Turnpikes, joined by an area homeowners' association, John Reidel (a homeowner whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits as early as the 1950s to stop the turnpike's construction), and several other affected individuals, filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on August 10. Defendants in the suit included the federal agencies, state transportation and environmental agencies, and the city of Tulsa. That November, Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike. On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett dismissed seven of the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid because there was no change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration. At a hearing on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett announced his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue at the heart of the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies. =Environmental concerns= Presence of the endangered interior least tern near the path of the Creek Turnpike caused worries its construction would have to be delayed. Initial turnpike plans included environmental mitigation features to reduce the amount of disruption the finished road would cause to the local environment. In the Jenks area, OTA planned to replace destroyed wetlands with new wetlands of equal or greater size. Landscapers were expected to plant two trees for every one removed to build the road. In March 1990, these plans were augmented to provide wetlands mitigation at a rate of three to one, for a total of of new wetlands. Additionally, of pasture would be allowed to revert to its natural state to create \\"dedicated natural succession areas.\\" On July 21, 1989, OTA approved a contract to transplant approximately 290 live trees in the path of the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree (equivalent to $ in dollars). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) objected to the construction of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs. OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA. A Tulsa-area supervisor with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented upon environmental issues pertaining to the Creek Turnpike in a 19-page letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dated February 9, 1990. USACE was responsible for issuing three essential permits (which OTA had applied for on November 6, 1989) that would allow construction to continue, and was required to consider input from the service. In the letter, supervisor Stephen Forsythe recommended that the permits be denied and further studies conducted into alternate routes for the turnpike and the environmental impact on roads that connected to the turnpike. However, USACE only had the authority to review the impacts the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland areas. Governor Bellmon publicly criticized Forsythe for focusing on concerns beyond USACE's jurisdiction. Bellmon's Transportation Secretary, Neal McCaleb, publicly stated \\"I think [Forsythe] is out of line[...] and would say so to Mr. Forsythe.\\" Bellmon and McCaleb discussed the letter in a private meeting with the Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan, although Lujan neither commented nor committed to any action regarding the letter. In response to Bellmon's criticism of the letter, Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued a public statement, saying \\"Running behind closed political doors like that demonstrates the governor is an environmental hypocrite,\\" contrasting his statements with a letter he wrote assuring a constituent in Jenks that the project would be \\"the most aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sound facility that can be constructed\\". In a letter sent to OTA in March 1990, USACE identified issues with the Creek Turnpike project, such as modifications to Polecat Creek's channel, impacts on the Arkansas River floodplain and levee system near Jenks, and loss of of wetlands. In two other letters sent in May 1990, USACE requested alterations to the project, detailing further concerns about destruction of a unique type of wetland near the turnpike's planned intersection with Yale Avenue, OTA's plan to temporarily drain Mill Creek Bridge Pond, and emergency access to homes only accessible by crossing the pond on a wooden bridge. USACE warned that, should the changes the corps requested not be made, the turnpike plans may violate federal law, which would result in USACE withholding the necessary permits. The corps also required \\"absolute assurance\\" that new wetlands constructed as part of the project's mitigation efforts would not be built on land that was formerly the site of a landfill. On March 29, USACE held a public hearing as part of the permit process. The hearing had around 500 attendees, with over fifty of them giving five-minute speeches against the turnpike. One speaker compared the highway's environmental impact to that of the wreck of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez. No citizens spoke out in favor of the project. OTA announced plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations because they did not meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway. Another letter, dated June 21, 1990, was sent by FWS to USACE, reporting that at least eight interior least terns, an endangered species, had been found on a small island in the Arkansas River approximately south of the site of the proposed turnpike bridge. Although the bridge was not yet under construction at the time, the anticipated eighteen-month period of bridge construction had the possibility of interfering with the terns' nesting period, which runs from mid-May to mid-August. FWS was also in favor of requiring OTA to prepare a full EIS, a process that could have taken up to three years. Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project appeared inevitable in October 1990, as a new area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered in the path of the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying \\"God only knows when [the Creek Turnpike will] be completed,\\" describing the project as a \\"total disaster\\" and commenting \\"If we had it all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project.\\" OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it. One stipulation the USACE placed on the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge as quickly as possible to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns. =Extensions= The possibility of extending the Creek Turnpike beyond its original termini at US-75 and Memorial Drive was raised as early as 1993. On May 28, 1993, Governor David Walters announced a proposed $3.1 billion (around $ in dollars) turnpike package, one part of which was the extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike to the west and the Will Rogers Turnpike in the east. As a result of negotiations between Walters, other lawmakers, and OTA, the package was ultimately pared down to $675 million (about $ in dollars); among the cuts was the eastern extension of the Creek Turnpike. This version of the package was approved by OTA on August 18, 1994. The package was ultimately killed almost two months later, when the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission voted 4‚Äì2 to stop the sale of the bonds associated with the project on October 3. Reasons for opposition to the package were varied, including concerns over OTA's debt level, toll increases necessary to fund the package, the state of the bond market, a federal investigation examining previous OTA bond sales, lack of details given about the package, the size of the package, and the proposed method by which the bonds would be sold. Another Creek Turnpike expansion proposal, connecting it again to the Turner Turnpike in the west, but only extending it as far as the Muskogee Turnpike in the east, was put forward by Walters's successor, Governor Frank Keating, in 1996. This proposal, accompanied by a proposed extension to the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City, was to be funded by increasing tolls by 10 percent statewide in 1999. Keating's turnpike package, too, encountered trouble from the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission. The body unanimously voted on July 25, 1996, to postpone an up-or-down vote on the projects, which together carried a price tag of $525 million (approximately $ in dollars), until more information was made available to its members. Keating declared the package dead in response to the commission's action. The Creek Turnpike extensions resurfaced in a 1998 turnpike expansion plan. OTA approved a $724 million (about $ in dollars) bond package at its meeting on January 9, 1998. This package, which carried the support of both Governor Keating and legislative leaders, included a extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner and Will Rogers turnpikes, extension of the Kilpatrick Turnpike, and a new toll road which would become the H.E. Bailey Turnpike Norman Spur. The plan, which was to be funded by a 15% systemwide toll increase, was approved by both the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission and Executive Bond Oversight Commission on January 29, 1998. Construction of the portion of the highway between the eastern terminus and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike. While construction of the other two sections of the turnpike ran according to schedule, progress on the Broken Arrow south loop lagged behind. Cost overruns due to higher-than-estimated land acquisition costs caused delays as the project was revised to save money. The project was stalled further by the May 3, 1999, tornado outbreak, as utility contractors were pulled off the project to contribute to service restoration efforts in the Oklahoma City area. By August 1999, the south loop was six months behind schedule. Despite the cost- saving measures, the south loop remained over budget by $16 million (around $ in dollars) in July 2000. The western extension was also over budget; OTA discovered over 100 abandoned oil wells that needed to be capped and leftover piping in the turnpike corridor. Budget overruns on the western leg of the turnpike were $5 million (about $ in dollars) in July 2000. The western extension was the first to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free until noon on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow, opened at 3 p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained toll-free until 7 a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of the other half of the south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2 p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year. =Later history= A new interchange at Aspen Avenue in Broken Arrow opened on May 18, 2012. The project was completed three weeks ahead of schedule at a cost of $6.137 million, of which $1.75 million was paid by OTA, with the rest coming from the City of Broken Arrow. The new interchange was expected to attract retail, dining, and entertainment development to the area around the interchange. A construction project that started in May 2012 expanded the turnpike to six lanes total, or three lanes in each direction, between US-75 and Memorial Drive. Throughout the project, speed limits along the turnpike were reduced to . The project was completed in October 2013. The Creek Turnpike originally bore no numbered designation. On March 10, 2014, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission unanimously approved a motion to apply the SH-364 designation to the turnpike. Tolls The Creek East toll plaza , motorists driving two-axle vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, pay tolls of $3.35 in cash, or $3.00 if Pikepass electronic tolling is used, to drive the entire length of the Creek Turnpike. Drivers of vehicles with more than two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls; six-axle vehicles are charged rates of $13.30 ($12.25 with Pikepass). Tolls are collected at three mainline toll plazas along the road, one between the US-75 and Peoria‚ÄìElm interchanges, one west of the Olive Avenue interchange, and one (labeled as the Creek East plaza) south of the 31st Street South interchange. Additional fares for traveling beyond the barrier tolls are collected at toll gates located at each exit; as at the mainline plazas, Pikepass customers receive a discounted rate at these gates. The Creek Turnpike is equipped with open-road tolling for Pikepass customers. The turnpike has been completely automated since early 1996; no human toll collectors are present. Cash customers pull to the right and deposit coins into toll baskets. Change machines capable of changing $1 and $5 bills are available, as well as machines that produce receipts for customers requiring them.

She was named in honor of Commodore Daniel Todd Patterson (1786-1839), who performed distinguished service at New Orleans during the War of 1812. Patterson was built at Westwego, Louisiana by Avondale Shipyard. She was commissioned on 14 March 1970, conducted shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in June and August 1971 made her first overseas deployment, a trip to northern Europe. Her next deployment, to the Mediterranean Sea for service with the Sixth Fleet, took place during the first half of 1974. When all newer escort ships were reclassified as frigates in mid-1975, Patterson became FF-1061. At about this time she was also updated, receiving enlarged helicopter facilities and the Basic Point Defense Missile System, whose launcher for eight \\"Sea Sparrow\\" guided missiles was installed on her afterdeck. Patterson made another Mediterranean cruise from late 1976 to mid-1977 and a third in 1978 and early 1979. In September and October 1979 the ship returned to northern European waters and in mid-1980 she provided help to the West Indies island of St. Lucia after it was hit by a devastating hurricane. After steaming east to the Mediterranean in October 1980, Patterson voyaged onward to make a tour of the Persian Gulf during the last months of that year and the first month of 1981. A fifth Sixth Fleet cruise followed from late in 1981 into 1982, with Red Sea operations at the end of the deployment. The frigate earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her activities during this time. In June 1983 Patterson was assigned to the Naval Reserve Force, based at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She remained in this non-deploying status for the next eight years, making frequent cruises in the western Atlantic area, from Canada to the West Indies, to keep Naval Reservists' training up to date. In late 1990 Patterson conducted counter- narcotics operations in the Caribbean, taking a two-way passage through the Panama Canal as part of her work. A final cruise, to Bermuda in May 1991, was followed by decommissioning on 30 September 1991. After more than three years in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Patterson was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995. Though later considered for transfer to Greece as a source of spare parts, she remained in U.S. Navy custody until late September 1999, when a contract was let for her scrapping. The ship was broken up at Baltimore, Maryland, during the rest of 1999 and the first half of 2000.

Biography He was born in New York City and attended the Bronx High School of Science. He did his undergraduate work at MIT and his Ph.D. in psychology at Princeton University's Department of Psychology under John Tukey and Silvan Tomkins. From Princeton, Abelson went to Yale, where he stayed for the subsequent five decades of his career. Arriving during the Yale Communication Project, Abelson contributed to the foundation of attitudes studies as co-author of Attitude Organization and Change: An Analysis of Consistency Among Attitude Component, (1960, with Rosenberg, Hovland, McGuire, & Brehm). While at Yale, Abelson was briefly a bass in the Yale Russian Chorus. With Milton J. Rosenberg, he developed the notion of ‚Äúsymbolic psycho- logic,\\" an early attempt, using an idiosyncratic kind of adjacency matrix of a signed graph, at a descriptive (rather than prescriptive) psychological organization of attitudes and attitude consistency, which was key to the development of the field of social cognition. The notion that beliefs, attitudes, and ideology were deeply connected knowledge structures was contained in Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding (1977, with Roger Schank), a work that has collected several thousand citations, and led to the first interdisciplinary graduate program in cognitive science at Yale. His work on voting behavior in the 1960 and 1964 elections, and the creation of a computer program modeling ideology (the ‚ÄúGoldwater machine‚Äù) helped define and build the field of political psychology. He was the author of Statistics As Principled Argument which includes prescriptions for how statistical analyses should proceed, as well as a description of what statistical analysis is, why we should do it, and how to differentiate good from bad statistical arguments. He was a co-author of several other books in psychology, statistics, and political science. In 1959, Abelson published a paper to elucidate different ways in which an individual tends to resolve his \\"belief dilemmas\\" (Abelson ¬´Modes of Resolution of Belief Dilemmas¬ª Journal of conflict Resolution 1959). Abelson received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from APA, the Distinguished Scientist Award from SESP, and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the International Society of Political Psychology. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. He died of complications of Parkinson's disease.

The free rotating rollers (dark gray) allow the wheel to slide laterally A molded plastic omni wheel Omni wheels or poly wheels, similar to Mecanum wheels, are wheels with small discs (called rollers) around the circumference which are perpendicular to the turning direction. The effect is that the wheel can be driven with full force, but will also slide laterally with great ease. These wheels are often employed in holonomic drive systems. A platform employing three omni wheels in a triangular configuration is generally called Kiwi Drive. The Killough platform is similar; so named after Stephen Killough's work with omnidirectional platforms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Killough's 1994 design used pairs of wheels mounted in cages at right angles to each other and thereby achieved holonomic movement without using true omni wheels. They are often used in intelligent robot research for small autonomous robots. In projects such as VEX Robotics, Robocup and FIRST Robotics, many robots use these wheels to have the ability to move in all directions. Omni wheels are also sometimes employed as powered casters for differential drive robots to make turning faster. Omniwheels are often used to allow for movement on the horizontal axis on a drivetrain, as well as forward and backward movement. Usually, this is achieved by using an H-drive. Omniwheels combined with conventional wheels provide unique performance properties, such as on a six-wheeled vehicle employing two conventional wheels on a center axle and four omniwheels on front and rear axles.\\"EZWheel Mechanics\\".

His father, from whom he received his first musical instruction in violin and piano, was a secondary school music teacher, his mother was active in church music, and his brother Arthur went on to a successful career as a professional cellist. In the Hadley home, the two brothers played string quartets with their father on viola and the composer Henry F. Gilbert on second violin.Tawa, From Psalm to Symphony, p. 262 Hadley also studied harmony with his father and with Stephen Emery, and, from the age of fourteen, he studied composition with the prominent American composer George Whitefield Chadwick. Under Chadwick's tutelage, Hadley composed many works, including songs, chamber music, a musical, and an orchestral overture. In 1893, Hadley toured with the Laura Schirmer-Mapleson Opera Company as a violinist. But he left the tour when the company encountered financial difficulties and was unable to pay his salary. In 1894, he travelled to Vienna to further his studies with Eusebius Mandyczewski. Hadley loved the artistic atmosphere of the city, where he could attend countless concerts and operas, and where he occasionally saw Brahms in the cafes. He heard Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony while there, and it made a strong impact on him.Tawa, From Psalm to Symphony, p. 263 During this period Hadley also befriended the German-American conductor Adolf Neuendorff, who gave him advice regarding his compositions. Professional life He returned to the United States in 1896 and took a position as the musical instructor at St. Paul's Episcopal School for Boys in Garden City, New York, where he worked until 1902. He wrote some of his important early compositions during his time there, including his overture In Bohemia, and his first and second symphonies. He also found prominent conductors to perform them, such as Walter Damrosch, Victor Herbert, John Philip Sousa, and Anton Seidl. Hadley made his own debut as a conductor on 16 January 1900, at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, leading a program mostly made up of his own works. In an age when American orchestras preferred European conductors to home grown ones, Hadley felt that he needed to establish himself in Europe. So he returned to Europe in 1904 to tour, compose, and study with Ludwig Thuille in Munich. It is possible that his studies with Thuille were suggested by Richard Strauss, whom Hadley met shortly after arriving in Europe. Hadley composed his symphonic poem Salome in 1905, not realizing that Strauss, whom he greatly admired, was working on an opera on the same subject. The work was eventually performed in at least 19 European cities, and he was invited to conduct it, along with his newly finished third symphony, with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1907. In the same year, he obtained a position as an assistant conductor at the opera house in Mainz. In April 1909, his first opera, Safi√©, premiered in Mainz under his baton. =Conducting= Later that year he returned to the United States to take a position as conductor of the Seattle Symphony. In 1911, he became the first conductor of the San Francisco Symphony. Hadley encountered some difficulties in San Francisco, where he tried to turn a group of theater musicians into a first rate orchestra. He brought a number of excellent musicians from the east, including his brother Arthur, to be principals in the new orchestra, but this created some resentments among the locals. Nonetheless, by his departure in 1915, the orchestra had made great strides. Hadley returned to New York in 1915, where he made many appearances as a guest conductor, and premiered many of his best known works. In 1918 he married the lyric soprano Inez Barbour, whom he had met in San Francisco, and who recorded his music as early as 1915. She thereafter sang many of her husband's works. Between 1917 and 1920 three of Hadley's operas received high-profile premieres, including Cleopatra's Night which bowed at the Metropolitan Opera on 31 January 1920. Hadley conducted some of the performances, becoming the first American composer to conduct his own opera at the Met, and the opera was revived the following season. Several critics judged it the best among the ten American operas to appear at the Met to that point. In 1921 Hadley was invited to become the associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic, the first American conductor to hold a full-time post with a major American orchestra. During his years there, his conducting received excellent reviews. As well as occasionally taking the helm for regular Philharmonic concerts, Hadley was assigned to lead stadium concerts during the summer, where he selected many works by American composers. He was eventually asked to regularly select American works for the Philharmonic to perform. He remained in this post until 1927, when he resigned. In that same year, Hadley was invited to conduct the first half of the season of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Buenos Aires, the first American to conduct the orchestra (the second half was conducted by legendary Clemens Krauss). In 1929, Hadley was invited to become the conductor of the newly formed Manhattan Symphony Orchestra. He led the orchestra for three seasons, including an American work in every concert. He then stepped down due to his frustrations with fundraising for the orchestra in the wake of the stock market crash. In 1930, was invited to conduct six concerts with the New Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo. His visit to Asia was met with great enthusiasm, and he composed a new orchestral suite, Streets of Pekin, inspired by a side trip to China, and led its world premiere with the Japanese orchestra. =Composing= Henry Hadley was one of the most performed and published American composers of his day. He considered himself first and foremost an orchestral composer, to which his many overtures, symphonic poems, orchestral suites, and symphonies attest. He also wrote brief concertos for both cello (his ') and piano (his Concertino, Op. 131). Yet he also wrote a large number of stage works, including several operettas and musicals, along with his five operas. Though his operas Azora and Cleopatra's Night received the most attention, his comedy Bianca, which won a prize offered by the American Society of Singers for the best chamber opera in English, perhaps due to its modest demands, received a number of performances during Hadley's lifetime and a few afterwards, even in Japan in the early 1950s. During his years in San Francisco, Hadley made friends among the city's elite, which led him to become a member of the exclusive Bohemian Club, for which he wrote three \\"music dramas\\", designed to be given a single performance outdoors at the Bohemian Grove in Northern California. These works were very similar to operas, but also contained some spoken dialogue. Hadley later adapted music from these works to be performed as orchestral suites. He also wrote a number of chamber works, although \\"he had no compelling desire\\" to compose it.Tawa, From Psalm to Symphony, p. 268 He produced a violin sonata, two string quartets, and two piano trios. According to Tawa, his most noteworthy chamber effort was the quintet in a minor for piano and strings, Op. 50, written in 1919. Hadley also wrote a large number of cantatas and oratorios, some of them, such as Resurgam, conceived on a very large scale. His work as a song composer is also noteworthy. Villamil claims that \\"Of his nearly 200 songs many can still be recommended for their unaffected, buoyant lyricism.\\"Villamil, pp. 192‚Äì193 She praises their \\"supple vocal lines\\" that are \\"sensitive to poetic concerns\\" and accompaniments that \\"can be inventive and provocative.\\" One of his choruses from The New Earth titled, \\"Song of the Marching Men,\\" has been recorded. Hadley was also a pioneer in film music. He was invited by Warner Bros. to conduct The New York Philharmonic for the soundtrack music for its 1926 film, Don Juan with John Barrymore; this was the first feature film with synchronized music and sound effects. He was also filmed with the New York Philharmonic conducting the overture to Wagner's opera Tannh√§user. He wrote a complete original score for the 1927 Barrymore film When a Man Loves. Final years In 1933, Hadley founded the National Association for American Composers and Conductors, which exists to this day. In spite of a cancer diagnosis in 1932, he decided to pursue his dream of establishing a summer classical music festival. =Berkshire Symphonic Music Festival - Tanglewood= In the Spring of 1934 Hadley scouted the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts for a site and support for his seasonal music festival. The region's well known Gilded Age summer colony had not entirely faded in spite of the Great Depression. Hadley's inquiries led to the formidable and cultured Gertrude Robinson Smith. Within a few months they staged three days of concerts in August with Hadley conducting sixty-five members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. The first concert on August 23 was under the stars before an audience of 3,000, including Mrs. James Roosevelt, the President's mother. For two more summers Hadley and Smith worked to achieve their vision of an permanent seasonal music festival. Initially known as the Berkshire Symphonic Music Festival, it soon became known as Tanglewood. Hadley's cancer surgery was initially successful, and he continued his career as a composer and guest conductor. However, his popularity as a composer began to wane, as popular and especially critical opinion turned against the robust romanticism which Hadley's music embodied. The quick success of the Berkshire Philharmonic Festival's first three seasons was a dream fulfilled at the end of his life. Hadley's cancer recurred, and he died in New York City on September 6, 1937. Awards During his lifetime he was awarded several honors: an honorary doctorate from Tufts University in 1925, membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Order of Merit from the French government. Legacy The majority of Hadley's personal papers and scores are housed in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. During his lifetime, Hadley's music was immensely popular, and was a regular part of the repertory of America's top orchestras, and was also performed in Europe. Many legendary conductors performed his music, including Gustav Mahler, Leopold Stokowski, Serge Koussevitzky, and Karl Muck. In recent years his music has been largely neglected, although a few recordings of his music have been issued. An enduring aspect of his legacy is Tanglewood, the realization of his dream to create a classical summer music festival. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

In July 1971, following shakedown training in the Caribbean area and a surveillance mission off Haiti, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and installation of the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which featured short-range \\"Sea Sparrow\\" guided missiles in an eight-round launcher on her afterdeck. Trippe was the Navy's first destroyer-type ship to receive this later-widespread contribution to shipboard protection against air and missile attack. The first months of 1972 were spent testing her new weapons and participating in exercises. In June the ship passed through the Panama Canal en route to Southeast Asian waters, where she provided Vietnam War aircraft carrier escort and naval gunfire support services during July and August. Trippe then went to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas, visiting many ports in a region that would see increasing U.S. Navy activity in the coming decades. She returned to the U.S. East Coast in December 1972, after a deployment that had taken her completely around the World. During an overhaul in 1973, Trippe was refitted to allow her to operate the larger helicopters of the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS). From August of that year into January 1974 she made her first tour with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. A second cruise to the Indian Ocean and Middle East followed in January‚ÄìMay 1975. Reclassified in mid-year as a frigate, with the new designation FF-1075, she spent the last three months of 1975 and the first five of 1976 in shipyard hands. Trippe returned to the Middle East Force in March‚ÄìJuly 1977 and went back to the Mediterranean for her second Sixth Fleet deployment in April‚ÄìOctober 1978. The next year she cruised around South American as part of exercise \\"Unitas XX\\" and operated off West Africa. thumbnail The busy frigate made four more Mediterranean deployments during the following decade, in 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1987. Some of her 1983 tour also involved visiting ports in West Africa, the southern Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean. In the mid-'80s she was also modernized, receiving a seakeeping-enhancing bulwark on her bow and the Close-In Weapons System. The latter's fast shooting radar-controlled 20 mm gun mount was installed on her afterdeck to improve her defenses against cruise missiles. On 19 April 1989, Trippe collided with fleet oiler off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida resulting in a below the waterline tear in the hull and the smashing of the auxiliary diesel generator's exhaust vent, which rendered the ship completely powerless.2 Ships Collide During Refueling. 20 APR 1989. Trippe was towed to Charleston SC by an ocean going tug boat. This was the same day as the USS Iowa turret explosion, also part of FLEETEX 3-89.Elsewhere in Atlantic, 2 Other Ships Collide. 20 APR 1989. Shot from USS Stump DD 978 just prior to connecting tow line She spent most of the late 1980s and the early 1990s operating in the Caribbean Sea area, with counter-narcotics service taking much of her effort. At the end of July 1992, Trippe was decommissioned and leased to Greece. The Hellenic Navy placed her in commission in April 1993 as Thraki, and she was formally sold to that nation in 2001.Naval Historical Center - DE1075 A major lube oil fire occurred while at Naval Dock Crete in 2003 melting the superstructure and destroying the interior of the ship.

She was named for Vice Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr. (1883‚Äì1965), former chief of the Naval Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research, who was deceased at the time of her commissioning. Admiral Bowen's son and namesake, Harold G. Bowen, Jr., who also retired as a vice admiral, presided over the U.S. Navy's 1969 inquiry into the Pueblo incident. Service history Bowen was built by Avondale Shipyard at Westwego, Louisiana. Bowen was laid down on 11 July 1969 and launched on 2 May 1970. The frigate was delivered on 17 May 1971. She was commissioned on 22 May 1971. Commanded by Commander Arthur Drennan, Bowen was part of the expeditionary force deployed off the coast of Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. In early September 1983, United States Marines at the Beirut International Airport came under artillery fire. After repeated warnings, Bowen was ordered to fire in defense of the Marines. On 8 September 1983, Bowen opened fire with her 5-inch gun, destroying several artillery pieces and a fire control tower in the mountains, southeast of Beirut. Bowens action received international media attention as the ship became the first warship to engage in hostile fire in the Mediterranean Sea since World War II. In all, Bowen made six firing runs, firing a total of 75 shells at hostile targets. For their actions, Bowens crew was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, the Navy Expeditionary Medal and proudly adopted the slogan \\"First to Shoot in Beirut\\". In early October 1983, after one month on the \\"Gun Line\\", Bowen was relieved by the battleship . Bowen was decommissioned on 30 June 1994 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995.

She was the fourth vessel named for John Cushing Aylwin. Aylwin was laid down on 13 November 1969 at Westwego, La., by the Avondale Shipyard, Inc.; launched on 29 August 1970; sponsored by Mrs. Charles K. Duncan; and commissioned on 18 September 1971 at the Boston Naval Shipyard, Comdr. Dan E. Fenn in command. Service history =1971-1973= Early in December, the destroyer escort sailed for her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, and arrived there on 10 December. After spending the holidays in port, Aylwin headed for Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, for shakedown training. While en roue, Aylwin stopped at Andros Island, Bahamas, for weapons testing. Arriving at Guantanamo Bay on 24 January 1972, the ship began four weeks of intensive training. She visited Santo Domingo for a liberty call before returning to Norfolk for post-shakedown availability. Late in October, the vessel participated in LAN-TREDEX 2-72 and then made final preparations for her first overseas deployment. On 1 December, Aylwin departed Norfolk to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Her first stop was at El Ferrol, Spain. Departing that port on 13 December, she transited the Strait of Gibraltar and proceeded to Athens, Greece, where she spent the holiday season. On 6 January 1973, Aylwin got underway for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) operations to be held in the eastern Mediterranean in conjunction with Task Force (TF) 60. The ship pulled into Golfe-Juan, France, on 17 January, then continued on to Gibraltar. Next came ASW operations in the eastern Mediterranean followed by a visit to Naples, Italy, for a two-week tender availability. The destroyer escort then visited Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. On 17 February, she participated in NATO Exercise \\"National Week,\\" held in conjunction with British, Italian, and Turkish warships. She arrived at Alanya, Turkey, on 28 February and then stopped at Athens; La Maddalena, Italy; Alicante, Barcelona, and Valencia, Spain; Tunis, Tunisia; Villefranche, Cannes, and Toulon, France; and Gibraltar. On 20 June, Aylwin got underway once more for the United States. She paused at the Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, Virginia, on 27 June, to unload her weapons and returned to Norfolk the next day ending an absence of seven months. The ship was dry-docked from 19 July to 20 August. She received the light air multi-purpose system (LAMPS) modification during a yard period lasting through 26 October. A tender availability came in November, and December found the ship in a stand-down period. =1974-1975= The destroyer escort sailed on 19 February 1974 for refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. While there, she took part in ASW exercises in addition to testing her new LAMPS equipment. She returned to Norfolk on 27 April to make final preparations for her second overseas deployment. On 17 June, Aylwin set sail for the Mideast and the Indian Ocean. Her first stop was Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, where she held gunnery exercises. She then proceeded to Trinidad for a refueling stop. Aylwin next put into Recife, Brazil, for a brief liberty period. She got underway again on the 28th to cross the Atlantic and arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 2 July. Aylwin's next stop was Luanda, Angola. Her visit there was curtailed by an outbreak of violence associated with that country's bid for independence from Portugal. The vessel weighed anchor on 13 July, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, and entered the Indian Ocean. Aylwin arrived in Port Louis, Mauritius, on 26 July, and continued on to Reunion Island on 31 July. Her next stop was Moroni, Great Comoro Island. On 6 August, she arrived at Mombasa, Kenya. The destroyer escort got underway again on the 17th and spent the next two months patrolling the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. She made brief stops at Djibouti, Afars and Issas; Masirah, Oman; Bahrain; Bandar Abbas, Iran; and Massawa, Ethiopia. After final calls at Mombasa and Port Louis, Aylwin sailed on 8 November to return to the United States. She retraced her earlier course and made stops at Recife, Brazil, and Roosevelt Roads before reaching Norfolk on 13 December. =1975-1976= The ship returned to sea in mid-February 1975 with a series of exercises in the Virginia capes area. On 17 March, she sailed from Norfolk, bound for the Narragansett Bay operating area to conduct a LAMPS test. During the cruise, she visited New York City and Albany, N.Y., before returning to Norfolk on 28 March. The next two months were occupied by a series of inspections. On 12 June, Aylwin sailed for Newport, R.I., to conduct a midshipman training cruise. While on this assignment, Aylwin was officially reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1081 on 1 July. She returned to Norfolk on 3 July. The ship sailed on 7 August for Guantanamo Bay and the fleet exercise CARIBEX. The next day, she experienced mechanical difficulties and proceeded to the Charleston Naval Shipyard for repairs. After two more attempts to sail to the Caribbean, Aylwin turned back to Norfolk on 27 August. After a month of repairs and preparations, the frigate sailed on 3 October for the Mediterranean. She reached Rota, Spain, on 13 October and was scheduled to take part in exercises. However, a boiler problem necessitated a run to Naples, Italy, for a two-week availability alongside tender . With the repairs completed, Aylwin set sail for Toulon, France, on 2 November to join NATO forces in Exercise \\"Isle d'Or.\\" Following this operation, Aylwin arrived in Palermo, Sicily, on 20 November. Additional visits were made at Athens, Greece; Souda Bay, Crete; and Kusadasi, Turkey. Aylwin returned to Naples on 22 December 1975 for the Christmas holidays. On 7 January 1976, Aylwin got underway with Task Group (TG) 60.1 for ASW exercises. She then sailed to the ports of Piraeus, Greece; Souda Bay; Bodrum, Turkey; Catania, Sicily; Valencia, Spain; Palma, Majorca; and Gaeta and Genoa, Italy. Aylwin briefly stopped once again at Rota on 17 April, then left the Mediterranean, bound for Norfolk where she spent May and early June in leave and upkeep. A week of ASW exercises came in mid-June. On 26 July, Aylwin proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she entered drydock at the naval shipyard on 8 August for overhaul. =1977-1978= The frigate departed Philadelphia on 6 June 1977 and steamed to her new home port, Charleston, S.C. There, she became a unit of Destroyer Squadron 20. During the next six weeks, Aylwin conducted local operations; and, on 18 July, she headed for the Caribbean and refresher training. She was back in Charleston on 20 September and spent the rest of the year in training exercises and inspections. Aylwin put to sea on 3 January 1978 to provide submarines and services as a target as they sharpened their hunting skills. The next day, she was directed to proceed to the Key West, Florida, area to conduct surveillance operations and relieve destroyer . She finished these duties on 10 January and arrived back at Charleston on the 11th. The next three months were devoted to local operations and preparations for overseas movement. Aylwin rendezvoused with other units of Cruiser- Destroyer Group 12 off Bermuda on 7 April and sailed across the Atlantic to Malaga, Spain. A series of ASW exercises followed; and, on 29 April, the frigate moored alongside tender at La Maddalena, Sardinia, for an availability. On 14 May, Aylwin put to sea, bound for Souda Bay. There, she joined NATO forces for Exercise \\"Dawn Patrol\\". Following that operation, the ship anchored at Skiathos, Greece, on 1 June. Her other ports of call during the cruise were Barcelona, Spain; Golfo di Palmas, Sardinia; St. Tropez France, Alexandria, Egypt, Haifa, Israel, Piraeus, Greece, Palma, Mallorca and Toulon, France. The last exercise of the deployment was Exercise \\"Display Determination,\\" which lasted from 26 September to 8 October. Following a final stop at Malaga, Aylwin set sail on 14 October for Charleston. She arrived at her home port 11 days later and spent the remainder of 1978 there undergoing upkeep. =1979= The ship devoted January and February 1979 to training and inspection and, on 26 February, began a restricted availability. She got underway again on 6 April for a dependents' cruise and, 10 days later, proceeded to Puerto Rico for refresher training. From 1 to 8 May, Aylwin took part in SUBASWEX 3-79. After completing this exercise, she sailed to New York City for the celebration of Armed Forces Week. The frigate returned to Charleston late in May and commenced a series of tests and inspections prior to beginning her next overseas deployment. On 1 August, Aylwin got underway for another Mideast cruise. She made refueling stops at Bermuda and Ponta del Gada before reaching Rota on 11 August. From Rota, she headed to Malaga and then continued eastward. She passed through the Suez Canal on 19 August and arrived in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, on the 22nd. She moved south on 1 September to the Gulf of Aden, thence steamed around the Arabian peninsula and through the Strait of Hormuz to reach Bahrain. The frigate got underway on the 4th to operate in the Persian Gulf and pulled into Dammam, Saudi Arabia, on 16 September for two days of liberty. Aylwin took part in a joint exercise with Saudi forces, then stopped at Bahrain for refueling. She proceeded to the Seychelles Islands on 8 October, but her stay was shortened by civil unrest. On 13 October, Aylwin sailed for Djibouti. From there, she headed into the Gulf of Aden to conduct an exercise with warships of the French Navy on 22 October. Aylwin steamed eastward and then north around the Arabian peninsula to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, where she participated in an exercise with naval forces from Oman. The frigate then sailed to Bahrain for a two-week upkeep period. That respite ended abruptly on 4 November when she got underway only two hours after learning that militant Iranian students had stormed into the United States embassy in Tehran and made captives of American diplomatic and military personnel. The frigate headed back into the Persian Gulf for surveillance and patrol duties that lasted until 9 December. On that day, Aylwin began the long voyage home. She paused at Djibouti to refuel, then sailed north, transited the Suez Canal, and continued across the Mediterranean to Rota, Spain, where she arrived on 23 December. After celebrating Christmas in that Spanish port, Aylwin sailed for Charleston on 28 December 1979. Following a stormy Atlantic crossing, she stood into Charleston, S.C., on 7 January 1980. =1980-1982= The frigate completed post-deployment stand-down on 6 February and spent the next two weeks making minor repairs. On the 19th, Aylwin returned to sea to conduct drills with Atlantic Fleet submarines. She carried out such routine training missions along the eastern seaboard until the end of April. On the 28th, the warship departed Charleston and set course for Brooklyn, N.Y., where she entered the yard at the Coastal Drydock & Repair Corp. for a major overhaul. The repairs ‚Äî which included major work to her main propulsion plant, a period in drydock, and many lesser modifications ‚Äî lasted a year almost exactly. She conducted sea trials on 29 and 30 April 1981 and returned to Charleston on 3 May 1981. Soon thereafter, Aylwin embarked upon a lengthy period of operations out of Charleston. Those operations consisted of a series of exercises preparatory to certification in the operation of her propulsion system and of her varied ordnance systems. Refresher training in the West Indies followed qualification preparations early in September. The frigate concluded refresher training late in October and reentered her home port on the 25th. Duty out of Charleston continued through the end of 1981 into February 1982. Late in February, Aylwin suffered damage to her high-pressure turbine that interrupted her training schedule until mid-April. The warship resumed exercises on 12 April with READEX 5-82 in preparation for a deployment to the Mediterranean planned for June. =1982= On 8 June 1982, the frigate steamed out of Charleston on her way across the Atlantic. In spite of damage she suffered in a collision with support ship during an underway refueling operation, Aylwin continued on to Rota, Spain, and arrived there on the 19th. She entered the Mediterranean Sea on the 20th,but ended up in Marseilles France for shipyard repair. and joined a carrier task group built around carrier . The warship's arrival in the Mediterranean came in the immediate aftermath of the 6 June Israeli drive into Lebanon against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) based there. Serious though conditions in Lebanon were, Aylwin carried out normal 6th Fleet operations, including a freedom of navigation mission across Libyan president Muammar al-Gaddafi's \\"Line of Death\\" into the Gulf of Sidra, until the latter part of August. By then, American diplomat Philip Habib had defused the situation in Lebanon by extracting an agreement from the contending parties which called for the departure of the PLO from Lebanese soil. Aylwin served as escort for two of the merchant ships providing transportation. On 21 and 22 August, she convoyed the Greek ship from Beirut to Cyprus with the first contingent of PLO evacuees. Returning to Beirut on the 23d, the frigate shepherded thence through the Suez Canal to Aden where the ships arrived on 29 August. Reversing course that same day, Aylwin stopped in Djoubti, Djoubti to refuel and take on supplies before retransiting the canal and headed for a liberty call at Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The warship put to sea again on 14 September to conduct antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises in the western Mediterranean. That same day, the Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel lost his life to assassins. That event and the massacres it sparked prompted France, Italy, and the United States to reconstitute the multinational force that had overseen the PLO evacuation. As a consequence, Aylwin broke off from Operation \\"Display Determination\\" and hurried east in company with carrier to support the reentry of the multinational force into Lebanon. Except for an 11-day visit to Gaeta, Italy, in mid-October, for repairs and liberty, the frigate patrolled the waters off Lebanon until the middle of November. Following a liberty call at Piraeus, Greece, between the 18th and the 21st, Aylwin headed for the strategic Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. Passing through the Straits, she conducted training evolutions with destroyer in the Black Sea before calling at Istanbul, Turkey, on 26 November. The warship passed through the Straits again on the 28th and conducted operations south of Crete until 7 December when frigate relieved her. Aylwin then laid in a course for Rota, Spain, on the first leg of the voyage back to the United States. The stop at Rota took up two days, and, on 12 December, she embarked upon the Atlantic passage in company with 15 other Navy ships. Aylwin reached Charleston on 22 December. =1983-1985= For most of the first five months of 1983, the frigate carried out no operational activity. Post-deployment standdown lasted well into January while an extended maintenance period occupied February and the better part of March. On 23 and 24 March, she made an overnight passage from Charleston to Norfolk where she entered the drydock on the 24th. Work on her hull and sonar dome took up the next five weeks after which Aylwin returned to Charleston to prepare for a deployment to northern European waters. On 29 May, she stood out of Charleston on her way to participate in Operation \\"United Effort/Ocean Safari '83\\" which included operations in the Baltic Sea. During that tour of duty the warship also made port calls at Portsmouth, England, on two occasions, and at Malmo, Sweden, and Aalborg, Denmark, once each. Aylwin returned to Charleston on 25 July and stayed there until the beginning of September. The frigate put to sea again on 2 September and headed south for a four-week assignment in the Caribbean Sea that included calls at a number of tropical ports that include the Bahamas, St. Kitts, Antigua, Venezuela, and Colombia. Back in Charleston on 4 October, she spent the remainder of 1983 engaged in operations along the east coast. During the first three months of 1984, Aylwin left Charleston only once, as part of a task group built around to conduct a readiness exercise during the first three weeks of February. Otherwise, she carried out maintenance and repair work that included the removal of her basic point defense surface missile system and its replacement with the phalanx close-in weapons system for antiaircraft defense. Between her return to Charleston from the readiness exercise late in February to the beginning of April, the warship concentrated on preparations for her impending assignment to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. She stood out of Charleston on 2 April in company with , , and . Aylwin and her three traveling companions made the Atlantic passage in 10 days and joined the 6th Fleet on 13 April. In the course of her six-month tour of duty in the Mediterranean, the frigate participated in two NATO exercises, a number of exercises with units of the 6th Fleet, and the ubiquitous independent ASW evolution. She punctuated her training duties with port visits throughout the \\"middle sea.\\" Relieved by at Tangier, Morocco, Aylwin got underway to return home on 24 October. She arrived back in Charleston on 2 November and, after a somewhat abbreviated leave and upkeep period, entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard on the 26th for a three-month availability that stretched into four. On 8 April 1985, Aylwin returned to sea to carry out refresher training in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The frigate completed that mission in mid-May and spent a week in Charleston before heading back to the West Indies on 24 May on a midshipman training cruise. She concluded her second cruise to the tropics at Charleston on 12 June and launched into a routine of inspections, upkeep, and minor repairs. During the first part of August, Aylwin voyaged to Vieques Island, near Puerto Rico, for shore bombardment drills. Back in Charleston on 12 August, she began preparations to visit northern European waters and the Baltic Sea. She embarked upon that two-month assignment on 26 August participating in Exercise \\"Ocean Safari '85 during the Atlantic crossing. After a call at Dublin, Ireland, between 22 and 27 September, the frigate sailed to the Baltic Sea. She stopped at Copenhagen, Denmark, and at Kiel, Germany, before carrying out training operations in the Baltic Sea. Aylwin made a final European port visit at Aalborg, Denmark, from 21 to 27 October and then got underway to return to the United States. She arrived back at Charleston on 6 November. Aylwin stayed at Charleston through the end of 1985 and for the first month of 1986. She went back to sea on 3 February 1986 to participate in FLEETEX 2-86 as part of the ASW screen for . =1986= The frigate returned to Charleston on 25 February and began two weeks of feverish activity preparing for an early deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. On 10 March, she stood out of Charleston in company with USS America once again and shaped a course for the Strait of Gibraltar. Aylwin and her colleagues passed into the Mediterranean on the 19th and became part of the 6th Fleet. Five days later, the warship joined in another freedom of navigation operation near Muammar al-Gaddafi's so-called \\"Line of Death.\\" That evolution ended on the 28th, and the frigate followed it up with port visits to the Sicilian ports Taormina and Catania. She then conducted ASW operations south of Malta until 13 April when she rejoined America's screen. Aylwin provided antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection for America while the carrier's air group combined with Air Force bombers to strike targets in Libya in retaliation for apparent Libyan involvement in terrorist attacks carried out against United States' citizens. The latest Libyan interlude ended on 27 April and, after another port call at Taormina, the frigate resumed more conventional 6th Fleet activities. In the ensuing weeks, she took part in two major exercises, and her crew enjoyed liberty in a number of ports. Aylwin completed turnover formalities at Tangier, Morocco, once again and got underway for the United States on 31 August. The warship reentered Charleston on 10 September. Except for two brief periods underway in December, she spent the rest of 1986 in port. =1987-1991= The Aylwin started 1987 home ported in Charleston, SC. Upon completion of the overhaul in June 1988, Aylwin steamed north to her new homeport of Newport, Rhode Island. Settled in Newport, Aylwin began a series of exercises and intensive training to help her prepare for an upcoming deployment. She spent eight weeks on a shakedown cruise in Guantanamo bay, Cuba going through refresher training before participating in US law enforcement operations with the US Coast Guard in November 1988. On 31 May 1989, Aylwin started her eighth major deployment and participated in eastern Mediterranean contingency operations in support of national objectives. Port visits to Cartagena, Spain; Alicante, Spain; Theoule-sur-Mer, France; Marseille, France; Naples, Italy; and Haifa, Israel. During this period Aylwin was nominated for the navy expeditionary medal. She returned to Newport, on 10 November 1989. In January 1990 USS Aylwin arrived in Boston for a four-month repair period. After five weeks of refresher training and law enforcement operations, Aylwin was ready for her ninth and final deployment. On 1 July 1991, Aylwin departed for UNITAS XXXII under the command of USCOMSOLANT circumnavigating the South American continent. While traveling throughout South America, Aylwin visited nine countries, crossed the equator and transited the straights of Magellan. Aylwin returned home to Newport on 13 December 1991. =Decommissioning and transfer to Taiwan= ROCN Ning Yang (FFG-938) Shipped in Keelung Port Aylwin was decommissioned 15 May 1992 at Newport, and struck on 11 January 1995 to be disposed of through the Security Assistance Program (SAP), transferred, Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) Section 516, Southern Region Amendment, to Taiwan on 29 April 1998 as Ning Yang (FFG-938).

Subsequent to this initial voyage overseas, McCandless adopted a regular schedule of deployments which took her to the waters of the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, Caribbean, and Persian Gulf. McCandlesss last tactical missions were in support of Operation Desert Storm‚Äîa US-led coalition force of 34 nations against Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait‚Äî from January through May 1990, and June through December 1991. McCandless was awarded the Kuwait Liberation Medal by Kuwait for her efforts during these deployments. 31 December 1991 marked McCandlesss assignment to the Naval Reserve Force, Atlantic (Norfolk, Virginia) where she was reclassified as a training frigate (FFT-1084). McCandless was one of only eight ships of her class subject to this redesignation. Simultaneously decommissioned and leased to Turkey under the new name of TCG Trakya (F-254) on 6 May 1994, McCandless was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January. Turkey purchased the vessel in February 2002. She was decommissioned in 2003 and scrapped.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is perhaps the legislation with the most significant influence in the development of ethics and compliance programs; similar ideas are encoded in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) marked the early beginnings of compliance programs in the United States. In the mid-1970s, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations discovered that a significant number of American companies participated in bribery overseas. ‚ÄúOver 400 U.S. Companies admitted to making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials, politicians and political parties.‚Äù (United States Department of Justice 2006) One of the most infamous cases of its time was the admission by a Lockheed executive, to the Multinational Corporations Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that Lockheed had paid bribes in the amount of $22 million to Japanese government officials in the course of trying to sell its aircraft. This revelation came on the heels of the U.S. Government providing Lockheed with a $250 million emergency loan guarantee (Hishikawa 2003). In an effort to restore faith in American business, in December 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law. This anti-bribery provision makes it ‚Äúunlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.‚Äù (United States Department of Justice 2006) The law also requires publicly traded companies ‚Äúto maintain records that accurately and fairly represent the company‚Äôs transactions. Additionally, it requires these companies to have an adequate systems of internal accounting controls.‚Äù (United States Department of Justice 2006) Following the passage of the FCPA, in 1988, the Congress became concerned that American companies were operating at a disadvantage because their foreign counterparts were, as a matter of practice, paying bribes to foreign officials and deducting those bribes as business expenses on their taxes. (United States Department of Justice 2006) Subsequently, the Executive Branch began negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a 34-member nation coalition consisting of the United States and 33 other countries, to enact legislation similar to FCPA. In 1997, the OCED signed the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. (http://www.oecd.org/document/21/0,2340,en_2649_34859_2017813_1_1_1_1,00.html) This regulation requires member nations to designate the payment of bribes to foreign offices as a crime and to follow the rules and regulations that govern bribery in international transactions. The U.S. ratified this convention and enacted implementing legislation in 1998. At this time, the FCPA was amended to include territorial jurisdiction over foreign companies and nationals. A foreign company or person is now subject to the FCPA, if the company or person either directly or indirectly through agents, engages in acts which further the facilitation of corrupt payments taking place within the territory of the United States.  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  In response to the FCPA and its requirement to implement internal control programs, in 1985 a private-sector initiative was formed called the National Committee on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (commonly known as the Treadway Commission). This Commission recommended that its organizational sponsors work together to develop guidance on internal controls. Subsequently, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) was formed, and in conjunction with the CPA firm Coopers & Lybrand, COSO authored and published in 1992 the ‚ÄúInternal Control-Integrated Framework\\". This framework has become the de facto standard in the accounting industry for auditing, evaluating and monitoring internal control systems. The COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework is now widely used by most organizations as the basis for ‚Äúestablishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting‚Äù ( 15 USC ¬ß 7262) and for the assessment of control effectiveness under section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley.  United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations  In 1984 Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act, which created a set of mandatory federal sentencing guidelines (Campbell & Bemporad 2006). As part of the Act, the United States Sentencing Commission was formed and delegated the responsibility ‚Äúto provide ‚Äúcertainty‚Äù and ‚Äúfairness‚Äù in sentencing, avoiding ‚Äúunwarranted sentencing disparities‚Äù while ‚Äúmaintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentencing when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors (Campbell & Bemporad 2006).‚Äù On May 1, 1991, as an extension of the Sentencing Reform Act, the United States Sentencing Commission submitted to Congress the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations] (FSGO), a set of standards that govern the sentences federal judges impose on organizations convicted of federal crimes. Enacted on November 1, 1991, core to the guidelines was the Commission's intent to ‚Äúprevent and deter organizational wrongdoing‚Äù through its design of the organizational sentencing guidelines. These guidelines describe the elements of an organization's compliance and ethics program that are required to be considered for eligibility for a reduced sentence if convicted. In general, the FSGO require an organization to establish standards to guide its employees and agents. These standards must reflect government regulations and industry standards and apply to almost all types of organizations including corporations, partnerships, unions, non-profit organizations and trusts. In 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to amend its existing organization guidelines to make the criteria for an effective compliance and ethics program more stringent. Two major standards were identified in the amended guidelines. The amended guidelines stated the need for directors and executives to take an active role in the management of its compliance and ethics program and the importance of promoting an organizational culture that is compliant with the law and demonstrates ethical culture. The amended guidelines outline minimum requirements for an effective compliance and ethics program and the amended FSGO has become synonymous with an effective compliance program. The FCPA, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines represent just a fraction of the standards and requirements organizations need to consider today when developing and implementing their compliance programs. ‚ÄúSince the passage of SOX, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), have all proposed and implemented new rules relating to compliance programs (Martin 2004).‚Äù Organizations today are increasingly accountable to mandated laws, regulations and standards on a number of dimensions, which include geographical/regional considerations, as well as industry and functional discipline concerns. These regulations and standards apply to a variety of financial and non-financial areas. Adding to this complexity are the ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù boundaries, which organizations have individually established such as organizational commitments, values, and contractual obligations. As a result of these dynamics, organizations at the very core of their business strategy need to establish the capacity and the capability to effectively address the conditions mandated by these external requirements and internally generated operating principles while still meeting their business objectives. History set the tone for increasing regulations and rising standards. Over time, organizations will need to be more proactive in anticipating and addressing these considerations while simultaneously protecting and building the enterprise. More and more organizations will need to translate, integrate and simplify these various standards and requirements into a cohesive approach.  Designing an effective compliance and ethics program  Designing an effective compliance and ethics program requires implementing a detailed plan that will make sure the business achieves their ethics objectives. The organization must have ways of managing, evaluating, and controlling business ethics and compliance programs. There are five items which can affect the success of the compliance and ethics program: (1) the content of the company's code of ethics, (2) the frequency of communication regarding the ethical code and program, (3) the quality of communication, (4) senior management's ability to successfully incorporate ethics into the organization, (5) and local management's ability to do the same. Compliance and ethics program with regulatory requirements and the organization's own policies are a critical component of effective risk management. An organizations program is recommended to include monitoring and auditing systems that allow detection of criminal and other improper context to be found easily. Maintaining the compliance and ethics program is one of the most important ways for an organization to maintain its ethical health, support its long-term prosperity, and preserve and promote its values. A compliance and ethics program supports the organization's business objectives, identifies the boundaries of legal and ethical behavior, and establishes a system to alert management when the organization is getting close to (or crossing) a boundary or approaching an obstacle that prevents the achievement of a business objective. Management should continuously improve its compliance and ethics program. This will enable it to better prevent, detect, and respond to similar misfeasance and/or malfeasance in the future. The compliance and ethics program should strive to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes to the organization. Every organization is unique and has its own objectives. As such, several objectives of the compliance and ethics program will be unique as well. There are a few universal program outcomes/objectives that a compliance and ethics capability should deliver. These include an enhanced culture of trust, accountability and integrity; prevention of noncompliance, preparation for when (not ‚Äúif‚Äù) noncompliance occurs, protection (to the extent possible) from negative consequences, detection of noncompliance, response to noncompliance and improvement of the program to better prevent, protect, prepare, detect and respond to noncompliance. An important aspect of a high-performing program, and one that cannot be overstated, is enhancing an ethical culture. A strong ethical culture that provides important benefits would including a ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù for when formal controls are weak or absent, and an open environment of trust, ingredients that help drive overall workforce productivity. A well-designed compliance and ethics program is only half the picture. Critical to its success and its ability to meet the challenges of constant change, increasing complexity, rapidly evolving threats, the need for continuous improvement requires organizations to have the commitment of both senior management and the board, adequate authorization and funding, the appropriate tools to facilitate measurement and rolling-up information, comprehensive training on the measurement process and an early socialization of approach.  Effective program implementation  Implementation is often the most difficult aspect of any program. This is the juncture where most failure occurs. However, if executed well, it can represent the biggest opportunity for positive influence on the organization's performance and culture. The engaged involvement of key stakeholders is critical to a successful implementation or major enhancement of a compliance and ethics program, i.e. the dialogue and agreement up front, by all the major parties, regarding the objectives, goals, and overall purpose of the program will be critical to the project's eventual impact. By working together, compliance and ethics officers, executive management, and the board can help ensure a compliance and ethics program not only contributes to the improvement of the organization's governance practices but the success of its company's strategy as well. One of most important conditions for an ethics program to be effectively implemented is the existence of a feeling of trust from the employees toward the organization. Organizations that present high levels of misconduct will experience lack of trust from its employees, which possible will cause high turnover among its workforce. Integrate compliance and ethics - Address the ‚Äúletter of the law‚Äù while promoting the ‚Äúspirit of the law‚Äù. For some companies this means making a breach of company policy as serious as breaching laws, resulting in ‚Äúinternal‚Äù standards being as important as ‚Äòmandatory‚Äô standards. Embed compliance and ethics risk management processes into the business - Organizations must systematically assess and prioritize present and emerging compliance and ethics risks. Such analysis should take into account the organization's culture, compliance and ethics history, as well as industry issues. Business processes should incorporate compliance and ethics program needs. Boards should routinely discuss these risks, and how they are addressed, with management. Demonstrate leadership - The board should ensure senior management consistently communicates and models the organization's values and behavioral expectations identified in the compliance and ethics program. Require accountability and ownership - In order to have the compliance and ethics program ‚Äúmake a difference‚Äù, it should foster a corporate culture that places responsibility on individuals for their actions and motivates everyone. The board and management should ensure employees have appropriate training and information and should participate in such training themselves. Provide an open culture - Issues and problems should be, and in some cases are, required by law to be investigated and proactively managed to resolution. Unethical or illegal behavior should be addressed promptly. Employees must be required to raise and resolve violations of compliance or ethics standards. To do so, they must feel confident that they can take action without fear of retaliation. Such fears have been reduced, but not eliminated, with the introduction of the ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù protections of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Canadian equivalents. The board should inquire of management the steps they are taking to create this open culture. Measure performance and results - Compliance and ethics processes and results should be monitored and measured. Objective data should support evaluations that are more subjective. Evaluation results should provide the basis for continually improving the program.  Measuring program performance  By using accurate, timely data on the organization's performance, managers know whether they are moving the entity closer to its objectives. Measuring compliance and ethics program performance help organizations gauge their improvement and learn whether the company's tactics are contributing to the success of the company's strategy. Keeping the board informed is a critical activity and robust performance reporting facilitates that important effort too. An organization's compliance and ethics program should be measured like any other critical capability. There are numerous benefits and challenges to measuring the performance of a program. A well-known maxim is \\"what gets measured gets done.‚Äù The compliance and ethics program and capability is no different. The Open Compliance and Ethics Group, OCEGTM, a non-profit organization that provides a performance framework for integrating governance, compliance, risk management and culture, has developed a Measurement and Metrics Guide (MMG) for assisting in measuring and reporting on the performance of compliance and ethics programs. This measurement platform advocates that program objectives be aligned with and contribute to the enterprise objectives in a tangible way. In order to achieve desired program outcomes, an organization should design processes and practices that effectively measure program dimensions on three key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness. = Effectiveness describes the quality of a program along two dimensions: design effectiveness and operational effectiveness. = * Design effectiveness describes the degree to which a system or process is logically designed to meet legal and other defined requirements. Does the system or process contain all the necessary elements to thoroughly evaluate risk? Has it been designed for maximum effectiveness? If not, what features must be added to improve the system? Design effectiveness is very much a logical test that considers all requirements, risks and boundaries and determines if the system is appropriately designed. * Operational effectiveness describes the degree to which a system or process operates as designed. If the system has been well designed, does it function correctly? Does it operate the way it was designed? If not, how must it be managed to elevate its level of operation? Operational effectiveness helps management understand if, given a strong design, the system is operating as it is intended. = The concept of efficiency captures the cost of the process or system ‚Äì not simply financial efficiency, the amount of money spent but also the cost of human capital expended. = * Financial efficiency describes the total amount of financial capital required to execute a process. * Human capital efficiency describes the type and level of individual(s) required to participate in the process. While human capital costs can be partially captured in purely financial terms, intangible opportunity costs must also be captured. In other words, if the program relies too heavily on senior executive time and focus, it may represent more than just purely financial costs (salary, benefits, and other overhead). An organization must also recognize the intangible costs of the loss of executive time and focus on other strategic objectives such as growth, profitability, talent retention, and customer loyalty. = Responsiveness should be looked at on two dimensions ‚Äî the system's ability to operate quickly and flexibly in response to changing circumstances. = * Cycle time describes the number of total hours and/or total duration that it takes to execute a process. * Flexibility/adaptability describes the degree to which the system can integrate changes including new requirements (e.g. a new law, rule or regulation) and/or new business units (due to merger and acquisition activity.) These changes may be internal; as managers study the results of past performance evaluations and make needed alterations. Or they may be external. New regulatory environments, changing market conditions, or altered public perceptions and concerns require the organization to make adjustments. A responsive system adapts quickly to changes in the environment. It also develops a long-range perspective, foreseeing more distant changes and preparing for them. A solid measurement system and approach should be implemented that embodies these principles: * Focused on Business Objectives, * Outcome-Oriented and a * Simple Measurement System. Key metrics and indicators should be specific/simple, measurable, actionable, relevant and timely. * Balance of Leading and Lagging - Lagging indicators show how the company has already done (revenue growth in the past quarter; number of workplace accidents in the last year). Leading indicators are those that may predict future performance. Examples are on-time delivery rate, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction ratings and, in turn, more sales to existing customers. * Indicators should provide visibility into both short-term and long-term objectives. Overemphasis on short-term objectives can stifle a company's long-term growth, by short-changing new product development. Emphasis on short-term financial results, such as quarterly profits, can lead to reduction in spending on research for new product development, or purchasing cheaper components to raise profit margins, leading to lower product quality, more product returns, complaints from customers, and loss of business. * Focus on Internal Trends before External Benchmarks - Program metrics and measurement should help management understand internal trends. Once internal trends are understood, the use of external benchmarks will be more meaningful. Performance measurement system should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis. It is only by gaining experience measuring performance that the organization can really refine and improve the system.  Future outlook for ethics and compliance programs  Compliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures, or ethical standards. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of the Bank's clients may be ambiguous or untested. This risk exposes the institution to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities, reduced expansion potential, and an inability to enforce contracts. Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) management capability is the solution to addressing increasing stakeholder expectations. Solid financial results are no longer sufficient. Stakeholders are demanding more. They want to know about non-financial results and the intangibles that will ensure financial growth. They want increased reporting and transparency and insight into an organization's strategy, risks, and operations along with an understanding of the manner in which business is conducted. As with the quality movement of the mid-1980s to early 1990s, these stakeholder demands are becoming baseline expectations. Compliance and ethics practices can no longer be viewed in isolation of the rest of the organization, as some function off to the side to keep an organization out of jail. It must become part of the overall business strategy and operations, pervasive throughout the entire organization. Ultimately, taking this integrated approach will lead to better overall performance and compliance will become less of a burden on the business.

Its purpose is to alleviate traffic problems within the city center. Background Proposals for the construction of the Underwater Artery have received heated debate since at least the early 90s. Proponents suggest that the project will create a bypass for most of the East-West car traffic, which currently has to cross the congested city centre (given that Thessaloniki is especially linear as a city). Opponents cite the high construction cost, question the efficacy of such a solution and voice concerns about effects on the urban environment. The contracts between the State and the contractor were signed on October 31, 2006. They were ratified by the Parliament on February 8, 2007.http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=777495&lngDtrID;=244 The project has a budget of 472 million euro, of which 66.5 million are to be provided by publichttp://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=9073372 and the rest by private funding.

It opened in December 1929 at a cost of $2.5 million. One year before, the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel opened in June 1928. Now the largest branch of the Caliente casino chain, the renovated building houses a casino with race betting, hundreds of slot machines, a restaurant and a Starbucks caf√©. The complex includes the Estadio Caliente sports and concert stadium. Like the resort, the racetrack was designed by Wayne McAllister and built by wealthy Americans Baron Long, a Los Angeles nightclub owner, Wirt Bowman, owner of the Tijuana gambling establishment, The Foreign Club, and James Croffroth, a member of the local Tijuana horseracing establishment. Some sources note the fourth partner was Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez, Military Commander and Governor of Baja California, and future President of Mexico. The lavish resort and racetrack on the Mexican border was popular among Americans, particularly Hollywood celebrities, because drinking, gambling and horse racing were still illegal in most of the neighboring U.S. states. The first manager of the track was Tommy Gorman, who had previously been involved in ice hockey. Although President L√°zaro C√°rdenas outlawed gambling in 1935 and closed the resort and casino, the Agua Caliente Racetrack continued to operate for many years. It was the site of several industry firsts, including starting gates, safety helmets, and ‚Äúpick six‚Äù wagering. Both Phar Lap and Seabiscuit ran and won the Agua Caliente Handicap, which for a time was the richest in North America. Such riders as Aureliano Noguez, Humberto Enriquez, Francisco Mena, Antonio Castanon and David Flores graced the jockeys' quarters throughout the days of horse racing. The race track is the originator of the Pick 6 (on the North American continent). Then known as the 5-10 and later on the 4-9'er. Some racetrackers called it the Big Six. The original grandstand structure was destroyed by fire in 1971, but was rebuilt and continues to operate today, though just a shadow of its opulent beginnings. It is currently owned by millionaire politician Jorge Hank who renamed it \\"Hip√≥dromo de Agua Caliente\\". It has not hosted horse racing since 1992, but presents greyhound races. The building was renovated in the 2010s and the Estadio Caliente stadium was built in the grounds. References Bibliography * Vanderwood, Paul J.

Barbey, widow of Vice Admiral Barbey; and placed in commission at Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 11 November 1972, Comdr. Theodore B. Shultz in command. Operational history =Pacific= After fitting out and completing sea trials at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Barbey got underway on 4 February 1973 for shakedown training in the Hawaiian Islands. Before post-shakedown availability at Long Beach, which commenced on 12 May, the ship enjoyed a three-day liberty at Acapulco, Mexico, plane guarded for and conducted acoustic tests at Seattle. The availability included a drydock period from 5 June to 9 October during which workers at Long Beach Naval Shipyard modified her flight deck and hangar to accommodate a light airborne multi-purpose system (LAMPS) helicopter and installed an experimental controllable-pitch propeller (CPP). Testing and adjusting the new propeller system occupied the ship through January 1974. After further acoustic trials near Seattle in February and two days as plane guard for Hancock in early March, Barbey embarked the Commander, Destroyer Squadron 13, on 8 March for the joint U.S.-Canadian Navy exercise COMPTUEX 2B-74. During the next six days, the destroyer escort stood by to rescue pilots from . She returned to San Diego for upkeep and minor repairs which included the installation of a steel ball 35-feet in diameter on the helo hangar and the correction of an oil leak in the CPP hub. On 2 May, towed her to drydock at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for ten days of further repairs to her CPP. On 16 May, she returned to San Diego for local operations that included plane guarding for . In late June, Barbey joined for three days of operations near Seattle before returning to San Diego on the 28th. On 12 July, the destroyer escort departed the west coast for several weeks of refresher training in Hawaii, her crew honing their antisubmarine warfare skills en route. On 30 August, following her return to San Diego, Barbey lost all of the blades of the CPP during tests and had to be towed by to Long Beach Naval Shipyard. =Redesignation= Hwai Yang Shipped in No.11 Pier of Zhongzheng Naval Base ROCN Hwai Yang, former USS Barbey During the first six months of 1975, the warship reinstalled the CPP and subjected the new propeller to extensive trials at sea. During late May and early June, she interrupted this routine to undergo refresher training at Pearl Harbor prior to returning to San Diego. On 30 June 1975, Barbey and all other destroyer escorts were reclassified frigates, and she was redesignated FF-1088. Local operations, training, and upkeep kept the ship busy until 17 November when she commenced removal of the equipment associated with CNO project DS 523 (the 35-foot ball). During the first five days of December, Barbey conducted sonar sound trials and engineering drills before serving as an engineering and ASW school for most of the ensuing two weeks. On 6 January 1976, the warship entered drydock at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs and modifications which primarily entailed the removal of the experimental CPP in favor of a standard, fixed- blade propeller. Following sea trials and deperming, Barbey conducted refresher training from 26 April to 7 May, then returned to San Diego for a month of preparation for upcoming inspections and tests. She completed a combat readiness test in mid-June before participating in readiness exercises in the eastern Pacific during the last week in June. Tests, inspections, and training in preparation for her upcoming Pacific deployment consumed the entire month of July. On the 30th, the frigate embarked a detachment of ASW helicopters and got underway accompanied by , , , , , and . Barbey took part in the exercise Comptuex 1-77 in the Hawaiian Islands and then put in at Pearl Harbor from the 12th to the 17th. During the frigate's passage to the Philippines, her crew guided the ship through multi-ship ASW exercises and various tactical drills. Following her arrival at Subic Bay on 6 September, nearly three weeks of intensive upkeep readied the warship for the combined Exercise \\"Kangaroo II\\" with the Australians off the east coast of Australia from 12 to 25 October. She visited Geelong, Australia during the first week of November before returning to Subic Bay for upkeep and replenishment until 11 December. The remainder of the deployment primarily involved exercises in the South China Sea. In December, the warship participated in ASW exercises, Exercise \\"Multiplex 1-77\\" and missile exercises, returned to Subic Bay for upkeep, and then closed out the year with a liberty call at Hong Kong. In mid- January 1977, Barbey served as plane guard for Enterprise during readiness exercises. Three weeks of upkeep and replenishment at Guam and briefings at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, preceded the ship's participation in the Exercise \\"Sharkhunt XX\\" in late February. Following a brief liberty at Kaohsiung and a sojourn at Subic Bay, the frigate returned to San Diego, where she arrived on 21 March. During the first two weeks of June, the warship sailed to the Pacific northwest for tactical exercises and a goodwill visit to Portland, Oreg. With the exception of a brief respite at Aberdeen, Wash., in mid- October, she remained in or near San Diego for the remainder of the year engaging in various exercises and drills designed to maintain the ship in a high state of readiness. On 23 January 1978, Barbey commenced an eleven-month overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which became her homeport while the overhaul lasted. During the overhaul, the warship received a Harpoon missile system among the improvements to her combat systems and engineering plant. In late November and early December, Barbey conducted sea trials to assess her engineering and sonar capabilities. Upkeep, training, and drills occupied the ship through the first half of 1979 culminating in the successful completion of her operational propulsion plant examination (OPPE) in late June. In July, the ship underwent refresher training until a problem with the emergency diesel generator forced her to return to San Diego for another overhaul on the 27th. Upon completion of the overhaul on 24 September until mid-October, Barbey participated in fleet exercises which she interrupted for a brief liberty at New Westminster, British Columbia. Following a month of upkeep at San Diego, she completed readiness exercises in November, including a combat systems readiness test, and the Exercise \\"Comptuex 1-80\\" in early December as a prelude to her upcoming Pacific deployment. On 11 January 1980, Barbey set sail for Pearl Harbor where she became a dedicated escort of a forming Thirty First Marine Expeditionary Unit, along with the guided missile cruiser in support of three three marines who served as reserve for Operation Eagle Claw in Iran April 24. All hands received respective Expeditionary Medals. Diego Garcia atoll on 5 May. Barbey began the return voyage to San Diego which included stops at Fremantle, Australia; Subic Bay, Guam, and Pearl Harbor. After arriving at San Diego on 12 July, she resumed the usual routine of upkeep, availability, inspections, and training during the remainder of 1980. In June 1990 Barbey sailed from her homeport of San Diego on a regularly scheduled deployment to the Persian Gulf. During her transit to the Western Pacific she made port visits in Hawaii, the Philippines, Singapore and Penang, Maylasia. She arrived at her destination on 1 August 1990. Barbey and her crew transitioned from a peacetime deployment in a moderate threat environment, to a wartime deployment when the forces of Iraq, under the orders of Saddam Hussein, invaded the Emirate of Kuwait.e Barbey, and her sailing mate for the transit, USS England, were immediately employed in Naval Operations to enforce the sanctions specified by UN Resolutions. During her deployment in the AG, Barbey and her embarked helicopter detachment, HSL-35 \\"Magus 32\\" provided support for the UN Resolutions and performed more surface ship interdiction intercepts than any other fleet unit in the AG during the period. Throughout the buildup of forces in support of Operation Desert Shield, Barbeys assets were utilized in interdiction and escort operations until she was relieved by USS Marvin Shields. Upon detaching from COMMIDEASTFOR she made her way back home with stops in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Hawaii. Barbey arrived in San Diego on 21 December 1990 and commenced a repair availability. In April 1991 Barbey deployed in support of Law Enforcement and Drug Interdiction Operations to the coast of Baja California and Central Mexico. During this period Barbeys crew and her embarked Helicopter detachment SH2-F \\"Sea Snake 11\\" conducted three at sea rescues, of which, two were from merchant ships of foreign registry. Upon completion of her LEO assignment Barbey participated in several fleet exercises and then entered another repair availability. ROCN Hwai Yang (FFG-937) Barbey was decommissioned on 20 March 1992 and struck from the Navy list on 11 January 1995. She was disposed of through the Security Assistance Program, foreign military sale to Taiwan on 29 September 1999, where she served as ROCS Hwai Yang (FFG-937). =In Taiwanese service= A naval version of the CS/MPQ-90 Bee Eye radar known as the ‚ÄúSea Bee Eye‚Äù was installed aboard ROCN Hwai Yang (FFG-937) for testing with the TC-2N missile.

Ainsworth (1886‚Äì1960). Ainsworth (DE-1090) was laid down at Westwego, Louisiana, on 11 June 1971 by Avondale Shipyards, Inc.; launched on 15 April 1972; sponsored by Mrs. Katherine Gardner Ainsworth, the widow of Vice Admiral Ainsworth; and commissioned on 31 March 1973 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, Lt. Comdr. Terrence E. Siple in command. Service history =Initial cruise= Following fitting out, the new ocean escort departed her home port, Norfolk, on 11 June and headed for Port Everglades, Florida, to prepare for sensor tests and calibration. She then proceeded to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba for shakedown training. While the members of her crew were becoming familiar with their ship and their duties, Ainsworth visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and then proceeded on to La Guaira, Venezuela, where she joined warships of four other navies in a voyage to Maracaibo to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, a naval victory which helped Venezuela to win her independence. En route home, the ship made recruiting stops at New Orleans and Miami before reaching Norfolk on 16 August and beginning preparation for her post-shakedown overhaul. She got underway on 16 October and, two days later, entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard in South Carolina. Less than a week after the work started, it was interrupted by rising tension in the Middle East; and Ainsworth was placed in a 36-hour ready standby status so that she would be able, if necessary, to race to the Mediterranean. However, the stressful situation soon eased sufficiently for her to resume the repairs which were completed late in February 1974. The escort operated along the east coast and in the West Indies until 18 July when she began a voyage in which she would circumnavigate South America, sailing south via the West Indies to Brazil and then proceeding on down the coast. Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo were among her ports of call before the ship rounded Cape Horn. While returning north in the Pacific, she visited Valparaiso and Callao before reentering the Atlantic through the Panama Canal. After stops at La Guaira and Cumona, Venezuela, she proceeded home via Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, and reached Norfolk on 16 December 1974. =1970s= Following leave and upkeep, the ship underwent tender availability alongside and then prepared for operations in the Caribbean which lasted until 24 March 1975 when Ainsworth again headed home. She arrived in Hampton Roads on 27 March and, but for a midshipmen training cruise during the latter half of June and a run back to the West Indies from 22 to 29 August, she worked in the Norfolk‚ÄìVirginia Capes area until early autumn. During that summer the ship was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1090 on 30 June 1975. On 3 October, the ocean escort headed across the Atlantic for her first visit to the Mediterranean, beginning a routine of alternating deployments to the 6th Fleet with operations on the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean. She reported to the 6th Fleet at Rota, Spain, on 13 October and relieved the frigate . During the remainder of the month, she visited Tangier, Morocco; conducted operations in the western Mediterranean; and made a port call at M√°laga, Spain. She left the Mediterranean on the last day of October and devoted the next three weeks to Operation \\"Ocean Safari\\" in the northern Atlantic and then spent from 22 to 28 November at Portsmouth, England, in company with the frigate . She headed back toward Gibraltar on the latter day and rejoined the 6th Fleet at Rota on 3 December. Her operations during the next five months took her almost the full length of the Mediterranean as she visited ports in Italy, Greece, Turkey, France, and Spain before she headed home on 26 April 1976. After reaching Norfolk on 5 May, the frigate operated in the Hampton Roads‚ÄìVirginia Capes area for the remainder of the year with the exception of a trip up the Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis in late September and early October for a visit to the Naval Academy. On 17 January 1977, Ainsworth sailed for the Caribbean. She stopped at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Fort- de-France, Martinique; and San Juan, Puerto Rico, before taking part in Exercise \\"CARIBEX 1‚Äì77\\" from 11 to 21 February. Upon her return to Norfolk on George Washington's Birthday, the ship readied herself for another deployment to European waters and got underway across the Atlantic on the last day of March. After reaching Rota on 12 April, she sailed for Skaramangas, Greece on 16 April; reached there on 21 April; and remained at that port for a month before proceeding via Souda Bay, Crete, to the Ionian Sea. There she took part in a series of 6th Fleet operations which‚Äîbut for runs to nearby ports‚Äîkept her busy until mid-July. On 15 July, she sailed for the Levant and visited Haifa, Israel, from 20‚Äì24 July. Then, after sailing westward, she reached Naples on 29 July and underwent a tender availability there until 11 August. Three days at Augusta Bay, Sicily, preceded her participation in 6th Fleet Exercise \\"National Week XXIII\\" from 16 to 22 August. During her ensuing operations in the western Mediterranean, she called at ports in France, Spain (Alicante), and Portugal (Lisbon) before sailing for home on 10 October. The ship reached Hampton Roads on 21 October and remained there until getting underway on 28 November for MARCOTT 3/77, a joint exercise with Canadian warships which kept her busy until she returned to Norfolk in mid-December. The frigate devoted the full month of February 1978 to the Atlantic Fleet's annual readiness exercise and then spent the first 12 days of March in upkeep at Norfolk before representing her sister frigates in Exercise \\"Shamrock,\\" a combined weapons test and training exercise. carrier , guided missile cruiser , and destroyer also took part in this demonstration which was observed by President Jimmy Carter. On St. Patrick's Day, she arrived at Jacksonville, Florida, and spent the rest of March in that vicinity supporting advanced underway training of surface warfare officers. She returned to Norfolk on 1 April to serve off the Virginia Capes as deck landing qualifications ship for LAMPS Squadrons 30, 32, and 34. During the five-day procedure 725 landings were made while 94 pilots were qualified. Then, following further operations in the Norfolk-Virginia Capes area, Ainsworth entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul which kept her busy until 1 March 1979. Underway for her home port the following day, she arrived at Norfolk on 3 March and conducted local operations until getting underway on 10 May for refresher training in the Caribbean. This West Indies cruise, which lasted through mid-summer, took her to the Bahamas, Guantanamo Bay, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Then, with fighting skills again honed to a keen edge, she returned to Norfolk on 23 August and operated locally until putting to sea on 1 October for 12 days of combined underway training exercises along the east coast and in waters off Puerto Rico. Upon returning home on 13 October, the ship began preparations for another deployment, got underway on 10 November, and proceeded via the Azores to Rota. After entering the Mediterranean, she continued on‚Äîvia the Suez Canal and the Red Sea‚Äîto the Persian Gulf and transited the Strait of Hormuz on 9 December. While in the Middle East she visited Jidda, Saudi Arabia; Djibouti, Afars and Issas; and Sitra, Bahrein. Ainsworth departed the latter port on 22 December 1979 and began 84 consecutive days of service underway at sea ready to act in any emergency which might arise in the area which might result from the prolonged crises precipitated by Iran's capture and occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the imprisonment of the American citizens who worked there. =1980s= Left to Right: Ainsworth, , and pier-side in Mina Salman, Bahrain in the summer of 1981. Coronado, the flagship of the U.S. Middle East Forces at the time, was painted white as is tradition for flagships since the Great White Fleet.On 11 March 1980, the ship finally put into Muscat, Oman, for fuel as she began her voyage homeward. Three days later, Ainsworth topped off her oil bunkers at Djibouti and continued on through the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean, to Gibraltar. Following brief stops in the Azores and at Bermuda, she ended the deployment upon her arrival at Norfolk on 17 April. After a month of leave and upkeep, the ship took part in COMPUTEX 4‚Äì80 and carried out naval gunfire support qualifications. At the end of a four-day visit to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, she got underway for home on 19 June and proceeded via Port Everglades to Norfolk which she reached on the 23d. Two days later, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability which lasted until 11 August. The vessel then began preparations for overseas movement and got underway on the 29th for Exercise \\"United Effort\\" and \\"Teamwork 80\\" which kept her at sea in the North Atlantic and the North Sea until she arrived at Copenhagen, Denmark, on 24 September. She also put into Oslo, Norway, Leith and Rosyth, Scotland, and Portsmouth, England, en route home which she reached on 2 November. After remaining in the Norfolk area into the new year, the frigate sailed on 6 January 1981 for Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, where she supported submarine training until 9 January. She then prepared for READEX 1‚Äì81 and gunfire qualifications which kept her busy until 17 February when work began on making the ship ready for another deployment to the Middle East. She got underway on 18 March and reached Rota on 29 March. After transiting the Suez Canal and the Red Sea from 14 to 17 April, she entered the Indian Ocean and headed back toward the Persian Gulf. After refueling at Sitra, Bahrain, she operated near the Strait of Hormuz until 11 May and then took part in Exercise PASSEX in the Gulf of Oman with the British vessels and . Next came battle group operations with the aircraft carrier and a visit to Kenya. En route to Mombasa, the ship crossed the equator on 23 May. Upon finishing another PASSEX on 3 June, an exercise conducted with two fast patrol boats of the Kenya Navy, she sailed for Sitra, Bahrain, in company with the aircraft carrier , en route to the Persian Gulf, and conducted operations with that carrier's battle group. Following almost a month's labors in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, she sailed for Djibouti on 8 July‚Äîbeginning the first leg of her voyage home‚Äîand took part in further exercises with Bacchante and Minerva in the Gulf of Oman and in operations with America in the Arabian Sea. She reentered the Mediterranean on the 19th and reached Haifa, Israel, two days later. Heading eastward on the 24th, she stopped at Palermo, Sicily, from 27 July to 8 August and then operated with carriers and until 19 August. On the last two days of those operations, she took part in a missile exercise in the Gulf of Sidra, in international waters off the coast of Libya. After arriving at Rota on 22 August, Ainsworth took part in Exercises \\"Ocean Venture\\" and \\"Magic Sword\\" before sailing for home on 4 September with the battle group built around Forrestal and reached Norfolk on 15 September. Following a month in leave and upkeep status at Norfolk, the ship moved to the York River on 15 October to take part in ceremonies celebrating the bicentennial of the American victory at Yorktown. On 20 October, she headed for the Bahamas to serve as a schoolship in antisubmarine warfare training for future commanding officers on the AUTEC Range at Andros Island. She returned to Norfolk on 2 November and, three days later, entered the Home Brothers' Shipyard for a selected restricted availability. This work was completed on 4 January 1982; and, but for short operations in the Caribbean during the latter half of February and the first half of October, the frigate spent most of the year in the vicinity of Norfolk. She again weighed anchor on 27 December 1982 shortly after departure from Norfolk the ship is believed to have struck a whale and blew out her sonar dome. She proceeded to Brooklyn Naval Shipyard where an emergency replacement of the dome took place taking approximately thirty days and proceeded eastward across the Atlantic, via Bermuda and the Azores, to Rota where she arrived on 7 January 1983. The next day, she pushed on toward the Levant to serve as a naval gunfire support ship backing the multi-national, peace-keeping force at Beirut, Lebanon. She served off that troubled land from 13 to 29 January and then proceeded via the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden for the Arabian Sea. Following a tender availability at Masirah, Oman, she got underway with carrier America's battle group for \\"Weapons-Week\\" operations in the vicinity of Diego Garcia, the American naval base in the Indian Ocean. Following these exercises, she arrived at Male, Maldive Islands, on 7 March for a port visit. Underway again on 13 March, she worked her way back with Americas battle group to Masirah which she reached on 26 March. Two days later, she sailed for Kenya and put into Mombasa on 5 April. On ll April, the ship headed back toward the northern Arabian Sea in company with America and, en route, participated in Exercise \\"PASSEX\\" which included Australian warships. She also took part in submarine exercises with the submarine . The ship transited the Suez Canal on 30 April and conducted special operations in the central Mediterranean with Nimitzs battle group before she was detached from the 6th Fleet on 10 May to return home. She pulled into Norfolk on the 20th and began a post deployment leave and upkeep period. Her ensuing operations along the east coast took her to New England waters before she departed Hampton Roads on 10 August for an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. The yard work, which included upgrading of the ship's sonar equipment and installation of a close-in weapon system lasted into the spring of 1984. Ainsworth sailed for Norfolk on 28 March and reentered her home port the next day. But for a run to the Bahamas during the second week of July for acoustic trials on the AUTEC range, the ship operated on the east coast for the remainder of the year and well into 1985. Late in March 1985, she traveled south to Florida and thence to the West Indies where she conducted shore bombardment practice at Vieques Island. Returning north to Norfolk in mid- April, Ainsworth operated in the immediate vicinity until late summer. On 27 August, the frigate stood out of her home port bound for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. For the next seven months, the warship escorted the carriers of the 6th Fleet as they traveled the length and breadth of the Mediterranean. She participated in a number of exercises testing the fleet's readiness and its ability to operate with elements of allied navies. When not so engaged, the frigate called at a variety of ports on goodwill missions. She completed turnover formalities at Rota, Spain, early in April 1986 and then set out across the Atlantic on 6 April. Ainsworth stood into Norfolk again on 16 April. Following the usual month of post-deployment leave and upkeep, the warship entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. to begin a 12-week repair period. Emerging from the yard again on 12 August, she operated in the immediate vicinity of Norfolk‚Äîeither in the lower Chesapeake Bay or just off the Virginia Capes‚Äîuntil early in October. On 4 October, Ainsworth headed south to the coast of Florida where she occupied the rest of the month carrying out refresher training. The frigate returned to Norfolk on 31 October and spent the remainder of 1986 in port. On 30 September 1990, Ainsworth was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and was reclassified as a training frigate (FFT-1090); one of only eight ships of her class subject to this redesignation. On 27 May 1994, she was decommissioned and leased to Turkey where she was renamed as TCG Ege (F-256). Ainsworth was stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995. = TCG Ege (F 256) = The frigate served in the Turkish Navy and was involved in many NATO operations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during 1990s. She joined the STANAVFORMED task force in the Adriatic Sea as a warship for search and patrol missions in 13 August 1995 for three months.https://www.dzkk.tsk.tr/data/icerik/22/SNMG2_EN.pdf She also participated in Dynamic Mix International Naval Exercise in 1998.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dynamic-mix-1998.htm The ship was decommissioned on 21 March 2005; she is currently preserved as a museum ship at ƒ∞nciraltƒ± Sea Museum, in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey.http://izmirmuzegemiler.dzkk.tsk.tr/en References External links * Category:Ships built in Bridge City, Louisiana Category:Knox-class frigates Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Turkish Navy Category:1972 ships Category:Museum ships in Turkey Category:Museums in ƒ∞zmir ","title":"USS Ainsworth"},{"id":"7720399","text":"Memory work is a process of engaging with the past which has both an ethical and historical dimension.(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. \\"The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich\\" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. History and memory The premise for memory work or travail de memoire is that history is not memory. We try to represent the past in the present through memory, history and the archives. As Paul Ricoeur argued, memory alone is fallible.(1955) Ricoeur, Paul. History and Truth. Translated by C. A. Kelbley. Evanston: Northwestern University press. (2nd edition 1965) Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare, uninterpreted facts. Historians construct and use archives that contain traces of the past. However, historians and librarians determine which traces are preserved and stored. This is an interpretive activity. Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to ‚Äúfacts that can be asserted in singular, discrete propositions that usually include dates, places, proper names, and verbs of action or condition‚Äù.(2000) Ricoeur, Paul. La M√©moire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli: l'ordre philosophique: √âditions du Seuil, p.226 Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective. Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed. Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped. A group's communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond, a sense of belonging and identity. Professional historians attempt to corroborate, correct, or refute collective memory. Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of at-risk groups. The concept of memory-work as distinguished from history-as- memory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso.(1991) Rousso, Henry. The Vichy Syndrome: History and Memory in France since 1944. Translated by A. Goldhammer. Cambridge/London: Harvard University Press. His title uses medical lexicon to refer to history-memory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history. This calls for an expanded archive that includes the \\"oral and popular tradition\\"(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. \\"The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich\\" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. p. 11 as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives. Pierre Nora on memory work Pierre Nora, introduced 'lieu de m√©moire' about 25 years ago, he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nation-state to the revisiting of distorted histories of the anti-Semitic Vichy France (1940-1944) following the death of Charles de Gaulle in 1970.(2002) Nora, Pierre. \\"The Reasons for the Current Upsurge in Memory.\\" Transit-Virtuelles Forum.22 Retrieved Access 2002. Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974. Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs Gulag Archipelago which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past. 'Lieu de m√©moire' closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory, instead of opening up perspectives. He associated memory with place, and location. During memory work, the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary, is central. Therefore, the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions.*(2008), Haug, Frigga. \\"Australian Feminist Studies\\" in Memory Work. Volume 23, 537-541. Jacques Derrida on memory work After meeting at Yale University in 1966, Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of Paul de Man'spage 1 until de Man's death in 1983. In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures, including one at Yale University on the art of memory. In Memories:for Paul de Man described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this often-cited passage. Barbara Gabriel on memory work Barbara Gabriel provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating unheimlich within the heimlich, in a Freudian 'one within the other structure'.(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. \\"The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich\\" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. As point of departure Gabriel examined Edgar Reitz's eleven-part West German television series entitled Heimat. Reitz' work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the Holocaust followed viewed by millions. As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s, artists like G√ºnter Grass and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided, post-Holocaust Germany. Gabriel developed the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost, far away, nostalgic place, a utopic homeland. \\"How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be, whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers?\\"(1982) Kristeva, Julia. Powers of Horror. New York: University Press. In other words, that which we fear as 'other' is within ourselves through our shared humanity. Repressed memories haunt all of us. Artistic and Activist Memory Work After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town, South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas, Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward, created a performance piece called Site in Melbourne Watch House in 2006. She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street, Cape Town, South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization, the largest of its kind in the South Africa. Post-colonial views The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a post-national point of view. Expanding on Norbert Loeffler: The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question, not as an answer. Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons. Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the Pied-noir, or French colonials in Algeria, who returned to France following the Algerian War. Examples of such thinkers include Jacques Derrida and H√©l√®ne Cixous. Another major writer in this field, Julia Kristeva, also moved away from the country of her birth, having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24.

Hart (FF-1092) was a , named for Admiral and Senator Thomas C. Hart. Thomas C. Hart (DE-1092) was laid down on 8 October 1971 at Westwego, La., by Avondale Shipyards, Inc.; launched on 12 August 1972; sponsored by Mrs. Reginald Bragonier, eldest granddaughter of Admiral Thomas C. Hart; and commissioned on 28 July 1973, Lt. Comdr. Ronald J. Forst in command. Initial cruises The last combatant ship commissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard, Thomas C. Hart conducted sea trials off the east coast before being homeported in Norfolk, Va. Following shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, she returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 1 February 1974, where she underwent a major structural conversion, altering her after superstructure to accommodate the new Light Airborne Multi-purpose System (LAMPS) facilities. She then steamed out for post-repair trials off the Virginia Capes. Deploying to the Caribbean, Thomas C. Hart conducted weapons systems tests and antisubmarine exercises and, upon completion of these duties, called at Port- au-Prince, Haiti, before returning to Guantanamo Bay for further training. After naval gunfire support qualification at Roosevelt Roads, she cruised to Bermuda for a three-day visit. She left Port Royal Bay on 3 September, having to do a \\"quick step\\" to avoid the tropical storm which later became Hurricane Delores, and arrived at Norfolk on 5 September. In October, following type training in the Narragansett Bay area, the ship qualified for a certificate for unrestricted operations. With Capt. W. R. Smedburg IV, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 10, and his staff embarked, Thomas C. Hart got underway on 18 November for Composite Task Unit Exercise 4-75 and nine days of intensive exercises. The following month, the ship passed her Nuclear Weapons Acceptance Inspection on 11 December and thus became a nuclear-qualified ship. Deployment The early months of 1975 were spent in preparation for Thomas C. Hart's first Mediterranean deployment. This deployment, which lasted from 16 June to 22 December, consisted primarily of operations with and other escorts while making a number of port visits in company with . On 1 July 1975, the ship was reclassified as FF-1092. Thomas C. Hart spent the first six months of 1976 engaging in two major fleet exercises in preparation for her four and one-half month, unsupported participation in Unitas XVII later in the year. The first exercise, \\"Safepass,\\" lasted from 6 to 26 March and involved complex NATO fleet operations out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The second exercise, \\"Solid Shield,\\" occurred during the period 13 to 18 May and involved operations off the coast of the Carolinas in support of a full amphibious landing on Onslow Beach. Following an intensive month-long preparation period in June, Thomas C. Hart commenced Unitas XVII on 9 July. During the next 18 weeks, the ship circumnavigated the South American continent and operated with host ships from Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. The frigate returned to her home port of Norfolk on 21 November and spent the remainder of the year in post-deployment stand down and holiday leave period. Early 1977 found Thomas C. Hart experiencing a period of maintenance, alteration, and testing. Of most significance was the installation of the Harpoon system, a highly sophisticated surface warfare missile which greatly extended Thomas C. Hart's reach against surface contacts. Most of September was spent in Norfolk preparing for the ship's second Mediterranean deployment. She departed CONUS on 27 September and engaged in seven months of operations with the 6th Fleet before returning to Norfolk again on 26 April 1978. Ports of call included Rota, Spain; Alexandria, Egypt; Istanbul, Turkey; Piraeus, Greece; Venice, Gaeta, and Naples, Italy; and‚Äîfinally‚ÄîMajorca; Valencia, and Rota, Spain. Following post- deployment stand down, Thomas C. Hart engaged in CORTRAMID 78, an underway training period for midshipmen, which lasted from mid-June through early July. In late September 1978, Thomas C. Hart's home port was shifted to Philadelphia in anticipation of the commencement of her first regular overhaul since commissioning. Thomas C. Hart entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for this purpose on 26 October, and she remained there into 1979. On 30 August 1993 the ship was transferred to Turkey as TCG Zafer (F253). Decommissioned, the ship was sunk as a target ship as part of Turkish Navy exercise Beyaz Fƒ±rtƒ±na 2016.

Anatomy One of the principal means of distinguishing the closely related black-tailed deer and white-tailed deer is the growth habit of the buck's antlers. In the case of the Black Tail and California mule deer, the antlers fork in an upward growth, whereas the other species' antlers grow in a forward direction.Taylor, Walter P., \\"The Deer of North America\\" Stackpole Company. Harrisburg, PA. (1956) Distribution This subspecies, O. h. californicus, is widespread throughout northern and central California in the California coastal prairie, as well as inner coastal ranges and interior mountains, especially the Sierra Nevada. This deer is much less frequently found on the floor of the interior valleys, and then mostly frequently in riparian zones. Habitat Generally, the California mule deer has a preference for hill terrain, especially an oak woodland habitat. It is a browser and typically takes over 90% of its diet from shrubs and leaves and the balance from grasses. Diet and behavior California mule deer usually browse close to lakes or streams providing their water. From that water source, they may roam 1-2 mi, and typically make their beds in grassy areas beneath trees within such a one-mile radius from both water and forage. Repeatedly used beds often are scratched to a nearly level surface, about 2 m in diameter. Less regularly used bedding areas are seen as flattened grass. On hot summer days, California mule deer often seek shade and rest in the midday. In summer, California mule deer mainly browse on leaves of small trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, but also consume many types of berries (including blackberry, huckleberry, salal, and thimbleberry). In winter, they may expand their forage to conifers (particularly twigs of Douglas fir), aspen, willow, dogwood, juniper, and sage. Year-round, they feed on acorns; grasses are a secondary food source. Where humans have encroached on historic deer habitat by suburban development or orchards, California mule deer diversify their diet with garden plant material, tree fruit, and occasionally, pet food. Fawns and does tend to forage together in familial groupings, while bucks tend to travel singly or with other bucks. California mule deer browse most actively near dawn and dusk, but also forage at night in open agricultural areas or when experiencing hunting pressure. A doe and her fawns in Auburn, California Breeding Rutting season occurs in autumn when the does come into estrus for a period lasting only several days. Males exhibit aggressive behavior in competing for mates. Does begin estrus again if they do not become pregnant. The gestation period is about 200 days, with fawns arriving in the spring; the young remain with mothers throughout the summer and are weaned in the autumn. The buck's antlers fall off in the winter, and commence growing once more in spring in anticipation of next autumn's rut. A buck during the rut in rural Auburn Human interactions Since prehistoric times, the Native American indigenous peoples of California are known to have hunted California mule deer. Thus, since about 12,000 BCE, Gage suggests that human populations have served as a control to the numbers of California mule deer. In the modern era, since European colonists and Euro- Americans settled in California, hunting pressure intensified as the human population expanded and hunting became an activity not just associated with food supply. In addition, human population growth (through urban development) in California has consumed large amounts of natural habitat of the California mule deer starting in the late 19th century and continuing through the present.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 1 February 1989. Kerry is Mavis and Harold Bishop's (Ian Smith) only daughter and David Bishop's (Kevin Harrington) sister. Kerry left home when she was young to travel the world. She met Eric (John Ley) and fell pregnant with their daughter, Sky (Stephanie McIntosh). Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Kerry began a relationship with Joe Mangel (Mark Little) and they eventually married. Kerry adopted Joe's son and fell pregnant again. However, while out protesting a duck hunt, Kerry was shot and she and her unborn child died. Kerry departed on 10 September 1990, but Hartley-Clark returned in 2004 and 2006 to record voice-overs. She also made an appearance in 2005 as Kerry's look-alike Gabrielle Walker. Casting Producers introduced the character of Kerry in 1989 to rescue Des Clarke (Paul Keane) from depression and eventually become his second wife. However, when Kerry began to interact with Joe Mangel (Mark Little), they became popular with viewers who wanted them to get together and the producers agreed with their opinion. Development =Characterisation= Kerry is the only daughter of Mavis and Harold Bishop (Ian Smith). After arriving in Erinsborough, Kerry moved into Number 24 with Harold. However, their very different personalities and views soon became a problem. Kerry had a daughter, Sky (Miranda Fryer; Stephanie McIntosh), out of wedlock and did not care for religion, which shocked Harold, who was a Christian. =Departure= When her contract came up for renewal in mid-1990, Hartley-Clark realised that she was fed up of working long hours, so she decided to quit the role after twenty months. Of her reason to leave, she stated \\"Once you start to get out of bed and sit in the toilet at five in the morning wailing, 'I don't want to go!' I think it's time to get out.\\" Hartley-Clark filmed her final scenes as Kerry in July 1990. She stated that Kerry had been a \\"wonderful\\" character to portray and she felt she had had a rewarding experience during her time on Neighbours. The decision was taken to kill Kerry off and Hartley-Clark thought that the end was \\"certainly final.\\" The actress believed it was the \\"only logical way\\" to write her character out, as Joe and Kerry would not have just ended their marriage. She quipped, \\"If you're going to go, you might as well go with a bang! Producers had months to plan Kerry's death and Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, noted that they chose to make it as poignant as possible.Monroe 1996, p.100. On-screen, a newly wed Kerry became pregnant, she was finally accepted into the Mangel family by her stepson Toby (Finn-Greentree Keane; Ben Guerens), and she was persuaded to return to her campaigning roots.Monroe 1996, p.103. On 10 September 1990, a heavily pregnant Kerry went to protest against duck hunting with her friend Amber Martin (Alison Whyte). Kerry was hit by a stray bullet and both she and her unborn child died. Kerry became the second regular character to die in Neighbours, following Daphne Clarke's (Elaine Smith) death in 1988. Hartley-Clark reprised her role as Kerry to voice letters to her on-screen daughter, Sky in 2004 and 2006. Hartley-Clark rejoined the cast in 2005 in the guest role of Kerry's look-alike Gabrielle Walker. Storylines Kerry is the youngest child of Harold and Mavis Bishop. She was a free spirit, in great contrast to her brother David (Kevin Harrington) who had inherited most of Harold's uptight qualities. When Kerry decided to rebel against Harold's way of life, it caused a great deal of friction and Kerry left home to travel the world. Kerry fell pregnant by fellow hippy Eric (John Ley) and they had a daughter, Sky. Kerry wanted to settle down, but Eric didn't and so he left them. Kerry is first seen in the coffee shop when Edith Chubb (Irene Inescort) complains to Harold about her bringing her own food in. Harold is about to reprimand her but soon recognises Kerry. Harold invites Kerry back to stay with him at Number 24 with him, his wife, Madge (Anne Charleston) and her son Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan). Kerry accepts. When Kerry meets Joe Mangel who lives across the road, there is an instant attraction as both are free spirits and have had to contend with stuffy parents. When it transpires Kerry has spent the night with Joe, Harold is appalled as he doesn't think Joe is suitable for Kerry and she decides to leave. Joe, at the last minute talks Kerry out of leaving and she repairs her relationship with Harold After a while, Kerry and Joe become engaged and later marry in an unorthodox ceremony in a butterfly house and adopt each other's children, Sky and Toby, respectively. The following year, Tragedy strikes when a heavily pregnant Kerry goes to protest against duck hunting in the marshes with her friend Amber Martin. Kerry is hit by a stray bullet and is rushed to hospital. Joe and Harold are devastated when the doctor tells them Kerry and the baby have died due to the severe blood loss from the shooting. Sixteen years after Kerry's death, Sky gives birth to a baby girl and names her Kerry in honour of her mother. Reception For her portrayal of Karry, Hartley-Clark won the 1989 Penguin Award for Best Actress in a Drama Serial. A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website stated that Kerry's most notable moment was \\"Marrying Joe Mangel in the butterfly enclosure at the zoo.\\" Robin Oliver from The Sydney Morning Herald branded Kerry \\"the greenie martyr\\". A columnist for the Sunderland Echo named Kerry's death as one of Neighbours' memorable moments. The columnist said it was \\"One of the most unexpected deaths the show has ever had\\". Tim Teeman and James Jackson from The Times also named Kerry's death as one of Neighbours' most memorable moments. They said \\"As the ducks quack all around and Joe gathers her in his befleeced arms, Neighbours eco-hippy Kerry Bishop dies saving ze animals\\".

Commissioned in the United States Navy from 1974 to 1991, she was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named for a Spanish-descended American war hero. In 1998, Valdez was leased to Taiwan and renamed Yi Yang (FF-939). Namesake Valdez was named in honor of Hospitalman Phil Isadore Valdez. Born on 13 April 1946 in Dixon, New Mexico. He graduated from Espanola High School, Espanola, New Mexico. On 1 November 1965 he reported to Recruit Training and then attended Naval Hospital Corps Schools San Diego, California. He was assigned to Naval Hospital Key West, Florida; and then on 19 December 1966 transferred to Bravo Co., 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force in the Republic of Vietnam, near Danang. Hospitalman Valdez was killed in action on 29 January 1967 while serving as corpsman with the Third Platoon when that unit was flown in by helicopter to provide support for the embattled Hotel Co., 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Upon landing Valdez‚Äô unit came under heavy sniper fire, and several Marines were wounded. Valdez sprang into action running across open land to an injured Marine while being raked by enemy fire. After helping the first Marine to cover and treating his wounds, Valdez returned to the open and rushed to the aid of a second Marine. Positioning himself as to protect the wounded Marine Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy sniper fire. As a result of his exceptional courage he was posthumously advanced in rank to Petty Officer Third Class and awarded the Navy Cross. Operational history =United States Navy= USS Valdez was laid down on 30 June 1972 at Oswego, Louisiana, by the Avondale Shipyard; launched on 24 March 1973; sponsored by Mrs. Manuelita Valdez, the mother of Hospitalman Third Class Valdez; and commissioned on 27 July 1974 at Charleston, South Carolina, Comdr. Joe D. Peden in command. The Valdez was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named for a Spanish-descended American war hero. Valdez spent the following three months in Charleston fitting out and completing final trials. She departed Charleston on 27 October, bound for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, whence she operated for the next seven weeks. Upon completion of her shakedown cruise, she returned to Charleston for a month of leave and upkeep followed by inspections and preparations for post-shakedown availability. That availability began on 25 February 1975 and ended on 11 April. At that juncture, she began normal operations out of Charleston and, later, participated in Exercise \\"Solid Shield,\\" an amphibious landing and convoy protection exercise conducted during the last week in May and the first week in June near Morehead City, North Carolina. On 6 June, the ocean escort returned to Charleston and resumed the normal routine until 18 August. During that period, she was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1096 on 30 June 1975. On 18 August, the frigate steamed out of Charleston for her first overseas deployment. She changed operational control to the 6th Fleet upon arrival at Rota, Spain, on 29 August. From there, the frigate moved into and across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt. She transited the Suez Canal on 5 September and the next day reported for duty with the Middle East Force at Djibouti in the French Territory of the Afars and Issas. During her tour of duty with the Middle East Force, Valdez participated in bilateral exercises with units of the naval forces of France, Iran, Abu Dhabi, and Pakistan as well as of the Air Force of Kuwait. She also embarked officers of the Saudi Arabian Navy for training and participated in the multinational CENTO exercise codenamed MidLink-75.

She recrossed the Mediterranean Sea and arrived back in Rota on 5 February where she remained until 8 February. Between 11 and 14 February, she visited Brest, France, where she participated in a gun salute symbolic of the first salute ever fired to the flag of the independent United States. From there, she set course‚Äîvia the Azores and Bermuda‚Äî to return to Charleston. Valdez reentered her home port on 25 February. After leave and upkeep, she resumed normal 2nd Fleet operations out of Charleston. That duty lasted until September when she began preparations for another 6th Fleet deployment. On 4 October, she stood out of Charleston and arrived in Rota 10 days later. On 16 October, Valdez reentered the Mediterranean. The ship spent the remainder of the year and the initial months of 1977 engaged in operations with the 6th Fleet. Valdez returned to Charleston on 21 April and commenced 30 days of leave and upkeep. Following a summer devoted to operations off the east coast, the fleet frigate began preparations for another overseas period, this time a deployment to the North Atlantic. She departed Charleston on 27 September to join a NATO task group for Exercise \\"Combined Effort.\\" During the next two months, Valdez engaged in other NATO exercises at sea interspersed with port visits. Her ports of call included Lisbon, Portugal; Portsmouth, England; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Bremerhaven, Germany; and Cherbourg, France.

Its mission is to overcome stereotypes and to foster mutual respect and understanding among Jewish, Christian, and Muslim women. The first group was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, in 2002. Groups then formed in Cambridge, Newton, Massachusetts, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts (at Boston College), and Washington, DC.  Mission  The purpose is to increase respect for all of the Abrahamic religions by reading books that teach about faith traditions and the practice of the respective faiths. The group members are committed to building relationships with each other. Daughters of Abraham is not a dialogue group, but a book group focused on discussions of books that explore the three faith traditions.  Membership  Any Jewish, Christian or Muslim woman who shares the Daughters' purpose can join.  Founding  The Daughters of Abraham was the inspiration of Edie Howe. She attended an interfaith service on the evening of September 11, 2001 and sat with Jewish, Christian and Muslim women. Looking around, she wondered what she could do to respond to the tragic events of that day. She decided to form a book group of women from the three Abrahamic faiths. This first group has been meeting since September 2002.  Meaning of name  In all three of the religious traditions, Abraham is revered as the first monotheist. In this sense, he is the \\"father\\" and the members can be thought of as his \\"daughters.\\" Even though they are \\"daughters\\" of different \\"mothers,\\" Sarah and Hagar, Abraham is the father of all three religions. By naming themselves Abraham's daughters, the group members are saying that there is more holding them together than separating them.  Meetings  Group members listen and speak respectfully to one another, do not monopolize the conversation, and speak from personal experience rather than making sweeping statements. Members suggest books at the meetings. Periodically, they review all the suggestions, then by consensus, choose the books that will be read. If anyone strongly objects to reading a particular book, it is not read.

He was granted a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation between 1967 and 1968. He moved to Indiana University in 1969, and eventually became the Mahlon Powell Professor of Philosophy as well as that university's first Dean of Latino Affairs, a position he held from 1978‚Äì1981. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences from 1981‚Äì1982. Philosophical work =Guise theory= Casta√±eda started from the fact that thoughts about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination, it is still a thought, and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of abstract objects (he calls it \\"abstractist ontology\\") that included both the real and the imagined.Casta√±eda, H., \\"Thinking and the Structure of the World: Discours d'Ontologie\\", Critica, 6(18) (1972): 43‚Äì86; reprinted as \\"Thinking and the Structure of the World,\\" Philosophia 4(1) (1974): 3‚Äì40. He referred to these objects collectively as \\"guises\\", and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties. He went on to develop the guise theory of intentionalityOn the importance of Castaneda by William J. Rapaport [who penned Castaneda's entry in the 'Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers'] at Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog (posted on February 16, 2015). and analyse all of language and perception in terms of these guises, ultimately developing an entire metaphysics based on them. One noted critic of guise theory was Alvin Plantinga, who developed his own rival theory involving a realm of abstract objects.Plantinga, A.: 1983, \\"Guise Theory\\", in Tomberlin, James E. (ed.): 1983, Agent, Language, and the Structure of the World: Essays in Honor of Hector-Neri Casta√±eda With His Replies, Hacket Publishing Company, Indianapolis.Edward N. Zalta, \\"Two (Related) World Views\\", No√ªs, 29(2) (1995): 189‚Äì211. Both theories were in fact based on even earlier work developed by Alexius Meinong.Uwe Meixner, The Theory of Ontic Modalities, Walter de Gruyter, 2013, p. 32. They differed, however, in the details of their metaphysical system and in how they regarded the basic building blocks of their respective systems. Casta√±eda's theory was temporarily undermined by the problem posed by Romane Clark's paradox, a paradox in naive predication theory.Romane Clark, \\"Not Every Object of Thought has Being: A Paradox in Naive Predication Theory\\", No√ªs, 12(2) (1978), pp. 181‚Äì188.William J.

Casta√±eda worked out a solution to block the paradox.Casta√±eda, H., \\"Philosophical Method and the Theory of Predication and Identity\\", No√ªs 12(2) (1978): 189‚Äì210.Palma (2014), p. 75. =Deontic logic= In deontic logic, Casta√±eda rejected Ross's paradox \\"on the grounds that the inference is only pragmatically odd in ways that are independently predictable by any adequate theory of the pragmatics of deontic language.\\"Casta√±eda, H., \\"The Paradoxes of Deontic Logic: The Simplest Solution to All of Them in One Fell Swoop\\", in Risto Hilpinen (ed.), New Studies in Deontic Logic, Dordrecht: Reidel, 1981, pp. 37‚Äì85. =Quasi-indexical= Casta√±eda introduced the concept of the quasi-indexical (or quasi-indicator), a linguistic device by which one person can attribute an indexical reference to another. His discussion on this matter strongly influenced John Perry's theory of indexicals, an influence which Perry acknowledged in the first footnote of the paper \\"The Problem of the Essential Indexical\\" (1979). Awards and honors In addition to his other academic honors, Casta√±eda received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. He served as President of the American Philosophical Association Central Division from 1979‚Äì1980, and was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. Casta√±eda was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by the Government of Guatemala in 1991.

S. Sims (FF-1059) was a of the United States Navy named for William Sims. She was in commission from 1970 to 1991. Construction and commissioning W. S. Sims was laid down on 10 April 1967, by Avondale Shipyards, Inc., Westwego, Louisiana. She was launched on 5 January 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. Hopkins (daughter of Admiral Sims), and commissioned on 3 January 1970, with C. M. Plumly in command. History Following an extended fitting-out period at the Charleston Naval Shipyard and a restricted availability at Jacksonville Shipyard for correction of minor construction faults, W. S. Sims became fully operational in June 1970, and proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for shakedown training. After a two and one-half month post-shakedown availability at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to correct deficiencies uncovered during shakedown and to install additional equipment, W. S. Sims was put to sea in November to evaluate the feasibility of installing the light airborne multi-purpose system (LAMPS). She was the first ship of her class to have a manned helicopter land on her deck and, during the next four days, she successfully demonstrated the capability of these new ships to operate manned helicopters. Upon completion of the testing, the escort proceeded to her home port, Mayport, Florida, for the holiday season. On 11 January 1971, W. S. Sims left Mayport with personnel from the Key West Testing and Evaluation Detachment embarked. The project consisted of six cruises, numbered 0 to 5, where W. S. Sims operated with various types of submarines in order to determine the capabilities and limitations of the installed long range underwater sound detection equipment. The tests continued throughout the year and took the escort to such ports as New Orleans; Fredriksted, St. Croix; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Nassau, Bahamas. The ship returned to Mayport in time for Thanksgiving and, between 22 November and 31 December 1971, was involved in a fleet standdown period, during which officials representing the squadron, flotilla, and type commanders conducted a series of inspections. The final cruise for the Key West testing project began on 4 January 1972. W. S. Sims returned to Mayport on 15 January and spent the next month preparing for operations with the 6th Fleet. On 15 February 1972, the ocean escort sailed for the Caribbean to participate in \\"LantFltRedEx 2-72\\" and then proceeded on to the Mediterranean. On 10 March, W. S. Sims inchopped to the 6th Fleet and took part in various antisubmarine exercises besides visiting Barcelona, Spain, and Naples, Italy. From 27 March to 6 April, the destroyer escort and maintained a close surveillance of Soviet naval units in the south central Mediterranean. W. S. Sims visited Gaeta, Italy, and Golfe Juan, France, before taking part in Operation \\"Quickdraw\\", a combined United States and Italian naval exercise held on 17 April. A visit to Sanremo, Italy, and tender availability at Naples followed the exercise. On 8 May 1972, the ship joined in a combined naval exercise, Operation \\"Dawn Patrol\\", with British, French, and Italian warships. After visiting Sfax, Tunisia, W. S. Sims conducted special surveillance operations on Soviet submarines from 23 May to 10 June. The ship then participated in Operation \\"Good Friendship\\" with the Turkish Navy and a second Operation \\"Quick Draw\\" with the Italian Navy. During August, the crew enjoyed leave at Sanremo, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; and Theoule, France. When relieved W. S. Sims late that month, the latter headed home and returned to Mayport on 5 September. Upon completing a month-long standdown period, the ship commenced an extended availability at the Jacksonville Shipyards, Jacksonville, Florida, which lasted through the end of the year and the first three months of 1973. The ship then carried out post-availability sea trials. The discrepancies which the testing uncovered were corrected by 9 April. The following day, the ocean escort steamed south to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, and joined the surface missile fleet in gunfire support exercises conducted at the Atlantic Fleet weapons range, Culebra Island. On 8 May 1973, W. S. Sims arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training, but an engineering casualty soon forced her to return to Mayport for repairs. When the corrections had been made, she returned to Cuba and conducted refresher training from the end of May to mid- June. Upon returning to Mayport, the ship executed a LAMPS workup from 17 June to 9 July. From 12 to 26 July, W. S. Sims participated in \\"LantRedEx 1-74\\" in the Caribbean. As her next assignment, the ship evaluated the basic point defense missile. The ocean escort returned to her home port on 10 August, enabling the crew to enjoy a period of leave and liberty. W. S. Sims sailed for North Atlantic and Mediterranean operations on 14 September. Upon arrival, the ship held a LAMPS demonstration for the Royal Netherlands Navy in Amsterdam. At the time of W. S. Sims' inchop to the 6th Fleet, the Middle East was in a state of war. For the first month and one-half, the ocean escort's duties involved operations in support of United States interests in the Middle East crisis. From 26 November to 30, W. S. Sims guarded the King of Morocco embarked on the French luxury liner Roussilion en route to the Arab oil conference held in Algiers, Algeria. The King, as a gesture of gratitude, sent the officers and men a gift of three tons of oranges, tangerines, sardines, and orange juice. After visiting Naples, Italy, and Rota, Spain, W. S. Sims spent the 1973 holiday season at Valencia, Spain. On 4 January 1974, W. S. Sims stood out of Valencia harbor to operate with . After a visit to Rota and exercises with , the escort ship participated in a search for survivors of a small British trawler; and four of six missing sailors were recovered. On 25 January, she proceeded via Gibraltar to Casablanca, Morocco, where she arrived on 1 February. The following day, the Soviet military attache came on board for a special tour of the ship. After brief stops at Rota and at Bermuda, W. S. Sims arrived at Mayport on 14 February. =1975‚Äì1980= During March and April, the ship took part in interim-sea-control ship-evaluation operations in waters between Jacksonville and Charleston. She returned to her home port on 27 April and underwent various inspections. The escort ship commenced tender availability on 6 May. On 1 July 1975, W. S. Sims was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1059. On 7 August, W. S. Sims sailed for the Portsmouth (New Hampshire) Naval Shipyard for repairs in drydock. She returned to Mayport on 19 September and spent the rest of the year and the first part of 1975 in training and in improving the physical condition of the ship. On 15 April 1975, the frigate joined in Fleet Exercise \\"Agate Punch\\" which involved naval air, surface, subsurface, and land forces. The exercise ended on the 27th, and W. S. Sims proceeded to the naval weapons station where she offloaded weapons in preparation for going into the shipyard in June. The ship suffered an engineering casualty on 30 April and was towed to Charleston for repairs. Upon her arrival back at Mayport on 8 May, W. S. Sims commenced a month-long tender availability. The escort ship got underway on 11 June for Philadelphia for a nine-month overhaul. The ship went into drydock on 21 June and remained there until 8 December; and, after she was refloated, work renewing the ship continued into the spring of 1976. After tests and sea trials in the Virginia capes area, the ship returned to Mayport on 14 April 1976. From the 23rd to the 27th of that month, W. S. Sims was moored at Port Everglades and then got underway for Andros Island and trials to evaluate new antisubmarine warfare equipment. She next returned to Mayport and conducted operations in the Jacksonville area. W. S. Sims arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 23 May and spent the next five weeks in intensive training. After an operational readiness evaluation and gunfire support qualifications at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the ship returned to Mayport on 2 July. Tender availability occupied the month of July and continued into August. After completing several inspections, W. S. Sims got underway on 2 September for a North Atlantic crossing. En route, she participated in Operation \\"Joint Effort\\", a series of exercises conducted in a task group environment. On 14 September, W. S. Sims was aft of when collided with that carrier and searched the nearby waters for any men who might have been thrown overboard. The North Atlantic cruise was divided into four separate operations. \\"Joint Effort\\", conducted during the crossing, was a workup phase. \\"Teamwork 76\\" was a major NATO exercise involving the forces of the United States, Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway. It included a show of strength in the North Cape area. \\"Baltic Operations\\" was conducted in the Baltic Sea and was an exercise in fleet steaming in a confined area. \\"Bonded Item\\", the final exercise, was an exercise designed around an amphibious assault at Jutland. On 27 October 1976, W. S. Sims departed Edinburgh, Scotland; headed home and arrived at Mayport on 9 November. The ship spent the remainder of 1976 and January 1977 in availability. Shipyard work and underway training occupied February. On 1 March, a propulsion examining board embarked; and the ship passed in all respects. During the remainder of the month, the escort ship prepared for an upcoming deployment. W. S. Sims departed Mayport on 30 March, bound for Lisbon, Portugal, and a six and one-half month Mediterranean deployment. A severe storm with 20- to seas, encountered en route, damaged the main mast to the point where it had to be supported by riggings of mooring lines. As a result, the ship arrived in Rota rather than Lisbon and remained there from 12 April to 13 May undergoing repairs. The destroyer escort then conducted operations in the areas of Crete, Greece, Tunisia, and Sicily. W. S. Sims arrived at Alexandria, Egypt, on 8 August and, during her visit there, was visited by the American consul general, the Governor of Alexandria, and the Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Navy. She then departed for Augusta Bay, Sicily. \\"National Week XXIII\\" began on 15 August and consisted of intensive war games involving both 6th Fleet task groups, elements of the Italian Navy, and American Air Force planes. The exercise concluded on 22 August, when the fleet anchored off Taranto, Italy, for debriefing. The crew enjoyed a port visit to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, before going to sea for \\"Bystander\\" operations near Gibraltar. After a tender availability at Naples, W. S. Sims joined the NATO Exercise \\"Display Determination\\"‚Äîalready in progress‚Äîon 24 September. When the exercise ended, the escort ship acted as the sole escort for as they visited Malaga and Rota, Spain. On 14 October, W. S. Sims, along with Independence and several other ships, departed Rota and arrived at Mayport on the 21st. The ship spent most of November undergoing tender availability and, on the 28th, participated in Operation \\"Marcot\\", a joint operation with the Canadian Navy. On 3 December, while operating near Bermuda, the ship lost all power due to an engineering failure. The ship had no power to any equipment except those powered by batteries. An aircraft responded to distress flares and contacted surface ships in the area. responded and came alongside, \\"skin to skin\\" on the high seas, with all lines tripled. In the midst of six-foot swells, there began heavy movement between the two ships causing frequent contact, buckling several frames in the midships section, and causing considerable superficial damage to the starboard side. After temporary repairs were made, all lines were cleared, and W. S. Sims returned to home port for repairs. The year 1977 ended with the destroyer escort in restricted availability, conducting repairs on both diesels and structural repairs to the starboard side. W. S. Sims remained in restricted availability into March 1978. On the 8th, she joined units of the 2d Fleet in the Caribbean for Exercise \\"Safepass \\"78\\". The ship then proceeded north to provide services for . After refueling at New London, Connecticut, W. S. Sims arrived back at Mayport on 24 March and began an upkeep period until 6 April. After successfully undergoing an operational propulsion plant exam, the frigate got underway for the Caribbean and Exercise \\"Comptuex;\\" then headed up the Cooper River to moor at the Charleston Naval Station on 27 April. After onloading weapons, the ship returned to her home port for availability and upkeep which lasted through 5 June. W. S. Sims conducted tests and inspections at sea, followed by an in port period from 13 to 28 June, during which she completed preparations for the upcoming Mediterranean cruise. On 29 June, the frigate sailed for her fourth and longest Mediterranean cruise. Following her Atlantic crossing, the ship arrived in Malaga on 9 July. After a brief run to Naples, she received on board Admiral H. E. Shear, Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe. The ship got underway on 29 July for Augusta Bay, Sicily, and for operations in the Ionian Sea. \\"National Week XXV\\" was held from 23 July to 5 August. After visiting ports in Greece, she participated in \\"Anti-Aircraft Warfare Week\\" and returned to Naples on 21 August. During the last week of August, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Thomas B. Hayward, paid a visit to tour the ship. The month of September found W. S. Sims taking part in Operation \\"Ocean Missilex\\" in the eastern Mediterranean; Operation \\"Display Determination-78\\", a combined NATO operation; and conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises with a Greek destroyer squadron and an opposing Greek submarine. The end of the month found W. S. Sims conducting tests with French submarine Daphne and NATO's oceanographic research ship Maria Paola Gee. Upon returning to La Spezia, Italy, on 2 November 1978, the ship took part in \\"Antisubmarine Warfare Week\\" from 7 November to 14 and then underwent intermediate maintenance availability at Cartagena, Spain. The frigate arrived at Toulon, France, on 9 December for a 10-day visit. W. S. Sims spent the holiday season from 21 December until the year ended in Alicante, Spain. Late in January 1979, W. S. Sims departed Malaga; and she arrived at Mayport in February. She remained at her home port through May preparing for an upcoming shipyard period. After a brief visit to Portland, Maine, W. S. Sims reported to the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 7 May 1979 for an overhaul. She was scheduled to return to Mayport in March 1980 and resume operations. :[1979-1991] Decommissioning and disposal W. S. Sims was decommissioned on 6 September 1991 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995. She was transferred to Turkey on 21 December 1999 as a parts hulk. On March 15, 1991 at 2100 hours the USA WS SIMS suffered a boiler explosion due to Officers ignoring the warnings of the Engineering Enlisted personnel to light the boiler during a ‚ÄúSoft BECCE‚Äù ( Basic Engineering Casualty Control Exercises ). The lighting of the boilers resulted in an explosion due to excess fuel oil. The ship was called to General Quarters at 2100 hrs lasting until almost 0500 am. A distress call was sent that a possible action of abandoning ship was imminent. The crew acted valiantly to save their home and the fire was out approximately at 0500am on March 22, 1991. A US Coast Guard Cutter arrived on scene and rendered assistance and towed the USS WS SIMS until a US Navy tug who was originally on route to Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico was diverted to relieve the Coast Guard Cutter and to take the USS WS Sims to Puerto Rico. The crew of the USS WS SIMS saved their ship over for four days with no power, retrieving water from four decks below by hand pumping and carrying buckets to the flight deck. No fatalities occurred and only minor injuries were suffered while fighting the fire. Flames as long as thirty feet were witnessed bellowing from the exhaust vents atop the mack ( Main mast and Exhaust stack ).

Early years Charles Francis Hurley was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to John and Elizabeth (Maker or Mahar) Hurley. He attended public schools in Cambridge, then Boston College High School. His mother died when he was seven, and his father when he was twelve. He was then raised by the family housekeeper, with a former United States district attorney as his legal guardian.Hurley Orphan at 12 He studied for two years at Boston College, before becoming a salesman for athletic goods. He entered the United States Navy in the First World War, serving in a radio intelligence unit stationed at Harvard University. After the war Hurley entered the real estate business, in partnership with James M. Conley. In 1924 he married Conley's daughter Marion; the couple had five children.Hannon, p. 249 Hurley was member of a number of social and fraternal organizations, including the American Legion, the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the Hibernian Society, and the Irish National Foresters. Political career Hurley's entry into politics was in 1919, when he won election to the Cambridge school committee, on which he served until 1931. In 1930 he ran as a Democrat for the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer, winning three consecutive two-year terms. Each year he defeated his Republican opponent by wide margins, leading to calls for him to stand for governor. Governor Joseph B. Ely appointed Hurley to the state administration's committee which distributed federal New Deal relief money, and was aligned with the Democratic Party faction opposed to James Michael Curley, the powerful Mayor of Boston. This faction was generally opposed to the influx of federal money,Trout, pp. 142, 144-145 and the party infighting meant that Hurley minimized the number of Curley supporters the committee engaged,Trout, pp. 158-159 and that the distribution of relief aid was hampered by the ongoing dispute.Trout, pp. 158-161 In 1936 he won the Democratic Party nomination for governor (Curley, the incumbent, was seeking a Senate seat), and then won the general election, defeating Republican John W. Haigis. Governor Hurley's administration was a brief departure from the increasing ethnic conflict between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics in political machines, party control, and business influence which had marked the state's early 20th century history. As a result of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th century, the predominant power of the native American classes had first eroded in Boston and then the state with brief checks and restoration of Yankee power in the interim. While Irish immigration had been reduced to a trickle with the Immigration Act of 1924 further immigration was negligible and the state turned to a process of assimilation and competition between the two groups for remaining power. Hurley represented the more legitimate side to Irish American politics and he attempted to prove the Americanization of his ethnic community by turning away from ethnic spoils which had marked his predecessors. Included amongst his program of cleaning up the civil service were the regulation of labor practices and emphasis on individual rights. Hurley building, Boston, 2011 first ball as Boston Red Sox manager Joe Cronin and New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy watch, at Fenway Park on April 23, 1937 During Governor Hurley's administration the Fair Trades Laws were passed which regulated the use of private police in strikes, imposed a minimum wage for women and children, and further regulated industrial work. While these practices endeared him to both ethnic groups, his administration also marked a departure from past practices with its increasing liberalism. Although both Yankee and Irish American voters had favored it, he vetoed a law to require teachers to take loyalty oaths. Additionally he raised the ire of Georgia's Governor Eurith D. Rivers by refusing to extradite James Cunningham who had escaped from a Georgia chain gang thirteen years earlier. Hurley further upset Yankee and Irish interests which had a long tradition of local representative democracy when he also approved a fifth form of municipal government in Massachusetts, called Plan E. This allowed for an appointed city manager and a city council drawn from a proportional representation of the vote, rather than a collection of majority elected precinct candidates. Yankee interests in several cities, such as Boston, had cherished their old Charter government from both historical precedence and the ability of ward representatives in protecting their interests in the majority Irish American city. The later in turn had long used the form of government in defending their interests when they were a minority and saw its abolition as a direct threat to their way of conducting business. Hurley oversaw the state response to the New England Hurricane of 1938, one of the worst natural disasters to strike the state. Later years and legacy When Hurley ran for reelection, he was opposed by James Curley, who had lost the 1938 Senate race. Curley rallied the state labor establishment to his side, and defeated Hurley in the primary. Curley was defeated in the general election by Leverett Saltonstall. Hurley then returned to private life, serving as a trustee of the Cambridge Public Library from 1941 until his death. He died on March 24, 1946. The Charles F. Hurley Building in Boston's Government Center complex is named after him.

Application  Groshongs may be left in place for extended periods and are used when long-term intravenous therapy is needed, such as for chemotherapy. Similar to the Hickman line, the tip of the catheter is in the superior vena cava, and the catheter is tunneled under the skin to an incision on the chest wall, where the distal end of the catheter exits the body. In contrast to the Hickman line, the tip of a Groshong line has a three-way valve, which is formed by a slit in the sidewall of the catheter tip. The valve opens outward during infusion, and opens inward during blood aspiration. When not being accessed, the valve remains closed.  Handling  The insertion of a central Groshong line is usually done under local anesthetic by an interventional anaesthesiologist, interventional radiologist or surgeon. Throughout the procedure, ultrasound and X-rays may be used to confirm placement. When a central venous catheter is inserted, a chest radiologic examination is usually performed to confirm the position of the catheter and absence of pneumothorax.

As a conservative Democrat, Ely was active in party politics from the late 1910s, helping to build, in conjunction with David I. Walsh, the Democratic coalition that would gain an enduring political ascendancy in the state. From 1931 to 1935, he served as the 52nd Governor. He was opposed to the federal expansion of the New Deal, and was a prominent intra-party voice in opposition to the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1944 he made a brief unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Early years Joseph Buell Ely was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, to Henry Wilson Ely and Sarah Naomi Buell Ely. His grandfather, Joseph Miner Ely, was one of the founders of Westfield's important whip industry, and his father, a lawyer, was active in Democratic party circles in heavily Republican western Massachusetts. Ely attended local schools, and then Williams College, where he helped organize student support for William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 presidential election. He graduated from Williams in 1902, and then received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1905. He returned to Westfield, where he joined his father's law firm. In 1906 he married Harriet Zelda Dyson, a schoolteacher; they had one son.Gentile, p. 474 Governor David I. Walsh appointed Ely to serve as District Attorney for the Western District of Massachusetts in 1915; he was elected in his own right to this position the next year, serving until 1920. Political career Ely was active in the state Democratic Party, and was in 1922 put forward as a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts; he placed a distant third in the primary, which was won by John \\"Honey Fitz\\" Fitzgerald. In 1924 he was delegate to the national Democratic convention, where he supported the Progressive Al Smith. In 1926 he was tapped by the party leadership as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but lost the primary in an unusual quirk. His primary opponent, Harry Dooley, had been asked to withdraw so that the party could present an ethnically diverse and geographically balanced ticket, but his name remained on the ballot, and he ended up winning the nomination because of the support of Irish Americans. Dooley offered to surrender the nomination in favor of Ely, but the latter refused, believing the means to be an embarrassment.Huthmacher, p. 124 Ely again supported Smith at the 1928 Democratic National Convention. In 1930, Ely again stood for the Democratic nomination for governor. He was opposed in this by the aging Honey Fitz, who was little more than a proxy candidate for former Boston mayor James Michael Curley. Curley loudly accused the Yankee Protestant Ely of being anti-Irish, which Ely countered by pointing out Curley's own public criticisms of Irish- American politicians in his campaigns. Al Smith campaigned for Ely, who won the nomination by a narrow margin.Allison and Bulger, pp. 52-54 Ely was opposed in the general election by incumbent Governor Frank G. Allen. The Republicans were harmed politically by the 1929 Stock Market Crash and the start of the Great Depression, and were further divided over the issue of Prohibition. Ely ran on a platform emphasizing debt-financed public works projects. After Ely took office, he began a series of public works projects to relieve unemployment. These were funded by long-term debts and were approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. Unlike other states, Massachusetts refused federal aid during Ely's administration.Gentile, pp. 474-475 Highway construction in Massachusetts was accelerated by this work, which was also supported by the imposition of a gasoline tax. Other policies advocated by Ely included substantial reductions in state salaries during the depression, which was met with overwhelming legislative resistance. In concert with the City of Boston, Ely established a permanent Boston Police Academy to increase the training of public safety officers. Curley and Ely would again cross swords in the 1932 presidential election, when Curley supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ely supported Smith.Allison and Bulger, p. 54 Ely and Walsh were successful in getting Curley and other Roosevelt supporters excluded from the state's delegation to the 1932 Democratic National Convention, although Curley attended the convention anyway as a delegate representing Puerto Rico.Beatty, pp. 307-313 Ely gave the convention speech formally nominating Smith,Trout, p. 107 but shifted to giving lukewarm support to Roosevelt after the latter won the party's nomination.Trout, p. 110 He was afterward snubbed by Roosevelt on federal appointment matters because of his support for Smith. Ely comfortably won reelection in 1932, defeating Lieutenant Governor William S. Youngman. Since the debt-funded works projects were not having a significant impact economically, Ely abandoned the idea in his second term, returning to \\"pay-as- you-go\\" financing for such projects.Gentile, p. 475 The divisive and at times acrimomious intra-party strife between Curley and the Ely-Walsh wing of the Democratic Party contributed to the state's difficulties in securing federal relief funds.Trout, pp. 120-134 Later years Ely declined to run for reelection in 1934 and returned to his law practice. He remained active in state and national Democratic politics, continuing to oppose Roosevelt's New Deal policies, which he considered \\"dangerously socialistic\\".Trout, p. 225 As legal representative to Boston real estate interests, he opposed the city's acquisition of land for New Deal projects,Trout, p. 153 tieing up the Old Harbor Housing Project in litigation for over two years.Trout, p. 244 In 1935, he joined the American Liberty League, and supported Republican Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1944, ending the bid after being badly defeated in the Massachusetts primary. Joseph Ely is well remembered in his hometown, where Westfield State University's Governor Joseph B. Ely Library is named in his honor.

It has been observed annually in India on December 7 since 1949. Over the years, it has become a tradition to commemorate this day as an honour to the soldiers, sailors and airmen of India.  History  Immediately after India achieved independence, a need arose for the government to manage the welfare of its defence personnel. On August 28, 1949, a committee set up under the defence minister decided to observe a Flag Day annually on December 7. The idea behind observing a Flag Day was to distribute small flags to the general population and in return collect donations. Flag Day gains more significance as it considers that it is the responsibility of the civilian population of India to take care of the families and dependents of the armed forces personnel who fight for the country. Jawaharlal Nehru, who was then Prime Minister of India, on December 7, 1954, said:The Hindu, This Day That Age published December 7, 2004, accessed November 1, 2006. ::A few weeks ago, I visited Indo-China and saw our officers and men attached to the International Commission there. It gave me a thrill to see their smart bearing and the good work they were doing in that distant land. What pleased me still more was their general popularity with the people there. By their efficiency as well as their friendliness, they enhanced the reputation of India. Among them were people from all parts of India. They observed no provincial or other differences amongst themselves. I am sure my countrymen will be pleased to learn of them and would like to indicate their appreciation of these young men who serve our country both here and elsewhere so well. A way to indicate that appreciation is to contribute to the Flag Day Fund. The flag is similar to that of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence, first utilised in 1956,https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb- def.html#:~:text=The%20Joint%20Services%20Flag%20is,with%20a%20plain%20black%20badge.&text;=The%20badge%20is%20that%20of,(symbolizing%20the%20Royal%20Navy). and is a common colour-scheme in British-aligned territories, used by fellow Commonwealth members Cyprus, India, Kenya and Nigeria.  Significance and purpose  The Flag day is mainly observed to serve three basic purposes * Rehabilitation of battle casualties * Welfare of serving personnel and their families * Resettlement and welfare of ex-servicemen and their families. The Armed Forces Flag Day commemoration and the collection of funds through distribution of flags. It is a time for Indians to express its gratitude and appreciation to the current and veteran military personnel of India and to acknowledge those who died in service to the country. On the Flag Day all three branches of the Indian armed forces, the Indian Army, the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy, arrange a variety of shows, carnivals, dramas and other entertainment programmes to showcase to the general public the efforts of their personnel to ensure national security. Throughout the country small flags and car flags in red, deep blue and light blue colours representing the three Services are distributed in return for donations.Indian Navy Information Resource and Facilitation Centre Website accessed November 1, 2006.  Flag Day Fund  The original Flag Day Fund was set up in 1949, by the Defence Minister's Committee. In 1993, the Defence Ministry of India consolidated related welfare funds into a single Armed Forces Flag Day fund.Kendriya Sainik Board Website accessed November 1, 2006. Those funds include, * Amalgamated Special Fund for War Bereaved, War Disabled and other ex-Servicemen/Serving Personnel * Flag Day Fund * St Dunstan's (India) and Kendriya Sainik Board Fund * Indian Gorkha Ex-Servicemen's Welfare Fund. = Fund collection = The fund collection is managed throughout the country by the local arms of the Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB), which is part of the Ministry of Defence. The collection is organised both by official and non-official means through voluntary organisations. Though welfare of the ex-servicemen and their dependents is the joint responsibility of the union government, and the governments of States and Union Territories (UTs), majority of the problems have to be resolved only by the States and UTs. Like the Kendriya Sainik Board at the centre, the Rajya / Zila Sainik Boards are responsible for policy formulation and implementation of resettlement and welfare schemes for ex- servicemen, widows and their dependents residing in their respective States / UTs / Districts. To assist the Central Government in this regard, there are 32 Rajya Sainik Boards and 392 Zila Sainik Boards in the country. The Secretary KSB advises the Department of Sainik Welfare in the States / UTs on the policies for resettlement and welfare of ex-servicemen, widows and seeks reports from the Director, Department Sainik Welfare / Secretary RSB and Zila Sainik Welfare Officer / Secretary ZSB, on implementation of policies and success in resettling ex-servicemen, widows, disabled personnel invalidated out from the Service and their dependents. Advice is also rendered on the welfare schemes required for the clientele, which are financed from funds allotted by the Governments of States / UTs and the Amalgamated Special Funds. The Fund is operated by a Managing Committee presided over by the Defence Minister at the centre and by the executive heads of the governments in the States and Union Territories. When the Armed Forces Flag Day programme was introduced, the fund allocation was managed in such a way that the Central KSB headquarters is given only a very small share of the Flag Day Fund collections made by each state. The allotted funds for the KSB is only half a paisa per individual in the state.

He opened one of the first automobile dealerships in Massachusetts, which in 1920 was recognized as \\"the world's most successful auto dealership\\", and made him one of the state's wealthiest men. Politically a Progressive Republican, he was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916, and served as a United States Representative from 1917 to 1921. From 1925 to 1929 Fuller was Governor of Massachusetts, continuing the fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies of his predecessors. In 1927 he was enveloped in the international controversy surrounding the trial and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian immigrant anarchists convicted of robbery and murder. Fuller's handling of the affair, in which both domestic and international sources sought clemency for the two, effectively ended his political career. Fuller was an avid collector of art, some of which has since been donated to museums in eastern New England, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He founded the Fuller Foundation, a charity that supports a variety of causes in eastern Massachusetts and the seacoast region of New Hampshire. Fuller Gardens, founded by him in North Hampton, New Hampshire, are now open to the public. Early years Alvan Tufts Fuller was born in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston on February 27, 1878, to working-class parents, Alvan and Flora Tufts Fuller. His family moved to Malden, Massachusetts, when he was still a child. He first worked in a rubber factory, repairing bicycles on the side. To promote his bicycle business he raced, winning local events.Clarke, p. 48 He also engaged in a practice, shared by other bicycle shops in the area, of holding an open house on the Washington's Birthday holiday. Automotive business empire Enamored by the new automobile, Fuller sold his racing trophies to finance a trip to Europe in 1899, where he learned more about the automobile industry. He acquired two cars (French De Dion-Bouton voiturettes), and had them shipped to Boston; they were the first motor vehicles brought in through that port. In 1903 he was awarded the Boston franchise for selling Packards,Einstein, p. 32 and later also acquired the local Cadillac franchise. A 1900 De Dion-Bouton Vis-√†-Vis Fuller was enormously successful in the automobile business, extending his sales reach as far west as Worcester and south to Providence, Rhode Island. He opened his first dealership on Commonwealth Avenue in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, then a largely undeveloped area known by sheer coincidence as Packard's corner, after the owner of a nearby livery yard. He was, however, soon followed by other auto dealers, creating the Boston area's first auto row.Clarke, pp. 48-49 Fuller was a significant factor in the success of Packard sales on the east coast, and was in 1920 dubbed the world's most successful car dealer. In 1927 he began construction on a new building at 808 Commonwealth Avenue. Designed by the noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, it became the flagship showroom for his Cadillac dealership. It is now owned by Boston University, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a car dealer, Fuller continued the practice of holding Washington's Birthday open houses, but the scale of events he staged was significantly more elaborate, and he is generally credited with popularizing the idea of the President's Day car sale that is now common in the United States. Political career =Congress= Fuller became interested in politics around 1912, supporting Theodore Roosevelt in his Bull Moose candidacy for the presidency. He refused the Progressive Party nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1912, but won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1914 under its banner.Herman, p. 208 Joining the Republican Party in 1916, he served as a delegate to its convention in 1916. The same year, he ran for the United States House of Representatives as an independent, winning a 16-vote victory over longtime incumbent Republican Ernest W. Roberts.Gentile, p. 540 He served two terms, in the Sixty-fifth and Sixty-sixth Congresses, from March 4, 1917, to January 5, 1921, winning election to the second term by a wider margin as a Republican. Fuller was an outspoken proponent of reform within Congress, and as a matter of principle never cashed paychecks he received for his public service, or used the Congressional franking privilege. He criticized the inefficient means by which legislation made its way through Congress, calling it \\"the most expensive barnacle that ever attached itself to the ship of state.\\"Guide to Congress, p. 58 Criticisms such as these prompted President Woodrow Wilson to introduce a new and more centralized budgeting system in 1919. Reforms Fuller proposed included a number of steps designed to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for political influence within the operations of Congress.Haines, p. 12 Governor Channing Cox In 1920, Fuller ran for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, and won two terms, serving as the 48th lieutenant governor from 1921 to 1925 alongside Governor Channing Cox. His principal opposition in both elections was in the Republican primary, where he was pitted against the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Joseph E. Warner. The Democrats were then relatively disorganized and lacking effective leadership, and were unable to counter the basic Republican message of \\"economy and sound administration\\" that had characterized recent elections.Huthmacher, p. 49 =Governor= Fuller was elected 50th Governor in 1924Huthmacher, p. 111 after Cox decided not run for reelection. The 1924 election was against the colorful Mayor of Boston James Michael Curley. Fuller's campaign rhetoric focused on the excesses of what it called \\"Curleyism\\", which it likened to a \\"graft-ridden spending spree\\".Huthmacher, p. 106 Curley attempted to tie Fuller to the Ku Klux Klan, but his charges were exposed as meritlessFuller's wife was Roman Catholic (a group the Klan disliked), and Fuller was known to have contributed to Catholic charities. Fuller was reelected by a substantial majority in 1926 over William A. Gaston, in a campaign dominated by Democratic calls for reform of Prohibition.Huthmacher, p. 145 As he had while in Congress, Fuller refused compensation for his services. Fuller was viewed as a law and order pro-death penalty governor and a fiscal conservative. He was, like his predecessors, a social moderate, enacting modest reforms in areas such as automobile insurance.Gentile, pp. 540-541 Police mug shots of Sacco and Vanzetti Fuller's tenure as governor coincided with the Sacco and Vanzetti case, a series of trials for murder and robbery followed by legal appeals that culminated in domestic and international calls for the governor to either grant a new trial, or to commute the death sentences, of the two Italian immigrants active in anarchist political circles. He appointed a three-member panel, consisting of Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, MIT President Dr. Samuel W. Stratton, and retired Probate Judge Robert Grant to conduct a complete review of the case and determine if the trials were fair. The committee reported that no new trial was called for and based on that assessment Governor Fuller refused to delay their executions or grant clemency. On May 10, 1927, while Fuller was considering requests for clemency, a package bomb addressed to him was intercepted in the Boston post office.Watson, pp. 303-4 A few months after the executions, he endorsed proposals to reform the state's judicial procedures to require a more thorough review of capital cases. The episode led to Fuller being characterized in the international press as provincial, and the controversy surrounding the cases and criticism of his handling of it (which was widely seen to exacerbate rather than diminish political tensions) effectively ended his hopes for higher office.Gentile, p. 541 New York Times reporter Louis Stark repeated a widely held belief that Fuller's decision to deny clemency was motivated by a desire to succeed Calvin Coolidge in the presidency, but there is no substantive evidence to corroborate this idea, beyond the coincident timing of Coolidge's announced decision not run in 1928 and Fuller's decision.Neville, p. 109Temkin, pp. 84-86 In 1930, Fuller stated in an interview that he was more concerned about the political activities of the two men and their supporters, which he saw as a threat to order and security of the United States.Temkin, p. 84 When Fuller was offered a print edition of The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1929 at the inauguration of his successor, he deliberately threw it to the ground.Temkin, p. 288 In 1928, Fuller was an early supporter of Herbert Hoover's presidential campaign, after considering his own run for the presidency, and was briefly considered as a candidate for Vice President. He was dropped from consideration because, as Republican Senator William Borah put it, \\"The Republican Party cannot afford to spend the summer debating the Sacco-Vanzetti case.\\"Jouhgin and Morgan, p. 314 His handling of the case was seen to reduce support for the ticket among immigrant communities. He was dropped from consideration by the Hoover administration for consideration as United States Ambassador to France after the French government indicated it could not guarantee his safety due to the Sacco-Vanzetti affair. (When the controversy was at its height in 1927, the Fullers had traveled to France, and the French government had secretly provided heightened security around their movements.)Neville, p. 76 Fuller considered running for Senate in 1930 and Governor in 1934, but dropped out of the primaries in those races. In 1933, he was appointed by the Public Works Administration (PWA) to a board overseeing the distribution of PWA funds in Massachusetts. He was again considered as a Vice Presidential nominee in 1932, but ran well back in the convention balloting. Later years After leaving office, Fuller returned to his automotive business, serving as chairman of the board of Cadillac-Oldsmobile Co. of Boston. In 1949 he dropped the Packard dealership, and focused exclusively on the Cadillac and Oldsmobile brands. Fuller was a philanthropist and art collector, serving as a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Painters represented in his collection included Renoir, Rembrandt, Turner, Gainsborough, Sargent, Monet, Van Dyck, Romney, Boccaccino, Boucher and Reynolds. Paintings that he and his successors donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the MFA include: Monet's \\"The Water Lily Pond,\\" Renoir's \\"Boating Couple,\\" and van Dyck's \\"Princess Mary, Daughter of Charles I.\\" His philanthropy was wide-ranging and included art, hospitals, education, religion, municipalities and social services. He established The Fuller Foundation, Inc., during his lifetime; still in operation, it supports many charitable agencies in the Greater Boston area and the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire. Fuller died in Boston on April 30, 1958. He was interred in East Cemetery (also known as the Little River Cemetery) in North Hampton, New Hampshire, where he had a summer home. The summer property included a large garden that the Fullers developed, with landscape design guidance by Arthur Shurtleff and the Olmsted Brothers. It is now open to the public seasonally. Family and legacy Fuller married Viola Theresa Davenport of Somerville in Paris in 1910, with whom he had four children, two boys and two girls. She had a brief career as an opera singer, performing in Paris and then debuting in Boston in 1910. She died in 1959. Peter D. Fuller, his youngest son, was an avid supporter of civil rights and continued the family auto business. He was the owner of Dancer's Image, the horse that won the 1968 Kentucky Derby, but was disqualified because a banned drug was found via a post-race urine test. Fuller subsequently lost a four- year legal battle to retain the Kentucky Derby title and prize money. Fuller also owned Mom's Command, the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly in 1985 that was ridden in most races by Fuller's daughter Abigail. Fuller's automobile dealership, established with license #1, continues to be operated within the family. Now dealing in rentals and used vehicles, it has locations in Watertown and Waltham, Massachusetts.

It houses offices for several nonprofit organizations, offers a variety of community programming, maintains a full ceramics studio, and rents space for community use. Union Project takes its name from one of its previous occupants‚Äîthe Union Baptist Church. The founding members bought an ailing church on the corner of Stanton Avenue and N. Negley Avenue. Built in 1903, the church had been home to a number of congregations until it was abandoned in the mid-1990s. Purchased for $125,000, the building was restored through a $1.6 million capital campaign. Funds were raised through a process of grassroots organizing, public grants, and private contributions. The project is run by a small full-time staff, a board of directors, part-time interns, and a dedicated team of community volunteers. Activities  Currently, the building houses a cafe and nine permanent office tenants, including; the Girls Coalition of Southwestern PA, Open Door church, America Votes, Jackson-Clark Partners, and PULSE. It makes additional rental space available: a conference room, a semi-circular atrium space, and a Great Hall. In order to restore the building's original stained glass windows, Union Project offered a series of workshops for artists of all skill levels to learn the art of stained glass restoration. During the project, the building's historic windows were cleaned, repaired, and re-installed by more than 200 community members. The restoration took ten years to complete. Union Project has developed a clay cooperative for artists in the Pittsburgh area. Clay artists pay a monthly fee for access to clay, glazes, wheels, kilns and other tools and materials. Additionally, Union Project offers ceramics classes for artists of various skill levels throughout the year.

Biography Su√°rez Rojas was born in Cabrera, Cundinamarca and joined the FARC in 1975 at age 22. He grew up without a father and received little education. Su√°rez Rojas was one of the most important Colombian guerrilla leaders. The U.S. Attorney General requested his extradition if he were to have been captured. Su√°rez Rojas was under indictment in the United States for killing three US citizens, terrorism and narcotics trafficking activities.US Department of State: Victor Julio Suarez Rojas The Colombian government also indicted Su√°rez Rojas on charges of rebellion, narcotrafficking, terrorism, kidnapping and extortion, among other crimes. He was indicted by the United States in 2002 for killing three US citizens in 1999. He was also accused of participating in the kidnapping of three US contractors. A proof of life video of the three released by the FARC in 2003 showed Mono Jojoy telling them that they were \\"prisoners . . . in the power of the FARC,\\" and that the governments of Colombia and the United States have \\"abandoned and forgotten you.\\" The three were rescued in July 2008.https://mondediplo.com/2008/07/10colombia'https://mondediplo.com/2008/07/10colombia =Alleged assassination plot= On 11 May 2008 a Colombian military commander told the press several rogue bodyguards of \\"Mono Jojoy\\" had been plotting to murder the FARC commander to collect the US$5 million reward on his head.

The United States government refused to pay the reward to the informant. Aftermath On 21 September 2010, experts in Colombia tried to crack the codes to 15 computers and almost 100 USB memory sticks belonging to Colombia's largest rebel group. One of the laptops is believed to have belonged to its military leader, Mono Jojoy, who was killed in the attack. Its screen was reportedly shattered by bullets, but its hard drive was still intact. The computers were examined by 40 experts from the police criminal investigation unit in the capital, Bogota. About 10,000 extra police officers were deployed to Colombia's main cities to prevent retaliatory attacks by the Farc.

Anglo-Saxon England was known for its tumultuous nature and the constant presence of outside threats and dangers made it necessary for a solid military to be constantly in place. However, in spite of this, by the 10th century, the Saxon kingdom of England was, perhaps, the best ordered state in Europe with a highly efficient administration that had a solid currency and could raise taxes to support a military establishment. Even though there is some controversy as to the accurate forms of military organisation, some aspects can be deduced from the records that have been preserved. The period can, however, be split into two: before settlement, AD 400 to AD 600; and the settlement period, when the Saxons had established organised kingdoms, AD 600 to AD 1066. Military organisation in the pre-settlement period (400-600) The Coppergate Helmet dates to the Anglo-Saxon era. The Saxons were organized into warbands led by a chief. The warriors comprising the warband were professional soldiers, though perhaps without the discipline of the Romans. There were three classes of warrior: The Gedriht were the personal followers of the chief and were sworn to die with him. There would have been few of them in each warband. They would have been well armed and the majority would have worn a helmet and chainmail armour. The main weapon was the Gar, a 2.5 m long spear with an ash shaft (Old English, gar = spear). Many would have carried long slashing swords. The second group were the Geoguth, or young warriors. They would have formed the bulk of the warband and would have carried a shield, spear, and Seax (a single edged dagger or short sword). Few would have had helmets or defensive armour. Mention of \\"dugu√∞a\\" in the Beowulf The Duguth, or old warriors, appear later in this period. They would have carried the same equipment as the geoguth and served mainly to provide a stabilising element in battle. In addition, there would have been skirmishers armed with either a bow or sling. =Method of fighting and army composition= This appears to have changed during this period. At the beginning, the shield was small, more like a buckler, and suggests that the men fought in open order. Later, the shield was enlarged (up to 1 m across) and the warband fought in close order, which required a reasonable level of training and discipline. This style of fighting had a long history; it was known as a shield wall or phalanx formation. The use of the horse in battle is very unclear and probably only the gedriht would have been mounted. However, horses at this period were small and would have had to be battle trained. On balance, the sources indicate that the Saxons fielded a balanced and effective infantry army. It seems likely that horses would have been used either for scouting or transport. It is not clear how large armies were; the Saxons themselves described anything more than 30 warriors as an army. This was about same number as a ship's crew. The general view is that an army would have been made up of a number of warbands under a senior chief, or Althing, and would have been between 200 and 600 strong.  Military organization in the settlement period (600-1066)  the Battle of Nechtansmere, where the Picts destroyed the Northumbrian army. The figures to the right show Anglo-Saxon mounted warriors wearing Coppergate-style helmets and these are unambiguously shown fighting from the saddle. The only unmounted Anglo-Saxon warrior depicted is dead, as indicated by the carrion bird near his head. The organisation underwent considerable changes, becoming essentially more feudal. The Gedriht became a more organised household guard , which provided a core of military specialists (the huscarls). Individual Earls would have had their own household troops. There is also a new class of lord, the Thegn, which was roughly the equivalent of the later Norman Baron: Thegns held land from the king and were responsible for raising the Fyrd in their area and leading them into battle. The richer Thegns would also have had their own household troops. However, the major innovation is in the organization of the Fyrd. This, in the post Alfred period, is called up in groups either to man the Burhs (each burh had a manpower level calculated according to the length of wall) or to serve in the field army. By this process, a Saxon army could remain in the field all year as there are always enough men at home producing food and goods. The army was thus significantly larger than in the early period. In addition, by the 11th century, the increasing wealth of England, its increased centralisation, and its growing class of freemen meant that helmets, weapons, and armour could be made in far greater numbers. This meant that, by the 10th century, laws appear to have required a freeman who had the financial means to own a spear, a shield, an axe or sword and a helmet. The laws of the day required Fyrd members to be men of a particular class, freemen, who could afford decent equipment and training. Weapons and equipment remained broadly the same, although the majority of a warband now had a helmet. The Dane Axe, which required a great deal of training to use effectively, became increasingly popular with the huscarls. Tactics and strategies Anglo-Saxon battle tactics have also spawned much debate. Some historians believe that horses were used, though most argue that the battles took place on foot. Infantry battles are reported in many texts from the period. Anglo-Saxon military organization is difficult to analyze. The combat strength of the Anglo-Saxon army is another issue that cannot be agreed upon by scholars. Some historians argue that the army was weak and only used infantry as a means of defense and attack, while cavalry were only used for scouting, whereas others believe that the army was more powerful, employing infantry and cavalry. The former argument suggests that the infantry was of a high standard but did not have the capacity to press home an advantage, due to the lack of cavalry. It was also suggested by historians until the 1980s that the Anglo-Saxons did not carry high quality weapons. Since the 1970s, however, archaeologists and historians have created a more varied view of Anglo-Saxon armies. The early Saxon armies are now thought to have been very formidable indeed, specializing in high-intensity close combat. The large shield was an offensive weapon as well as defensive. In the later period, the Saxons adopted the Danish battle axe, which had a 1.3 m shaft and could decapitate a horse or break up an opposing shield wall. There was no cavalry in western Europe capable of consistently breaking a well-ordered shieldwall, aside perhaps from the Byzantine Cataphracts. This was due to the relatively small size of horses, and the fact that, even with the advent of the couched lance in the 12th century, well disciplined spearmen still presented a major problem for cavalry. This was demonstrated at Hastings when the Normans, who probably were the best cavalry of the period, tried all day to break the Anglo-Saxon line. To judge the effectiveness of any military formation one first needs to determine what was its function. The early Saxon armies were aggressive small raiding units that could be quickly combined in a larger unit to take land and goods. The later army's function was defensive and was the military expression of an organised state. It not only depended on raising manpower through the fyrd, but on a network of burghs that provided supply bases and mustering points. It was this system that allowed Alfred and his successors to conquer England and for Harold to move his army rapidly against the Norwegians and defeat them at Stamford Bridge then move elements 250 miles south to Hastings. There are some battles in which scholars generally agree on which tactics and methods were used. The Battle of Hastings, in 1066, the soldiers were organized with the best in the front line and the less adequate fighters in the following lines. They formed a tightly packed shield wall, with spears projecting from the front rank over the shieldwall. Protecting the areas behind and to the side were a small number of archers, javelin throwers and slingers. The Bayeux Tapestry also shows armoured Saxon warriors using the long handled Danish axe. Either they stood in front of the shield wall or the wall opened to let them through. Though this formation has been criticised, it was highly effective; it provided reasonable cover from missile weapons and was capable of fending off most cavalry. It also needs to be remembered that all the Saxons needed to do in order to achieve victory was to hold their position until sunset, and the Normans would be forced to break off the days fighting. The Normans, deprived of supplies and reinforcements, be penned into a small area and with no way of feeding themselves or their horses, would have been forced to retreat. It was, in fact, rather effective at repelling the Norman Cavalry and it was only the death of Harold and his brothers, probably towards the end of the battle, that caused the Saxon command system to ultimately fail and the battle to be lost. This strategy was also used in the battle of Sherston in 1016, only with a slight difference - instead of simply holding position, the army advanced on the enemy while maintaining their solid formation (A refinement of this tactic was used in the crusades: as the army neared the enemy line, gaps would open in the 'shieldwall' through which the cavalry would charge). Military tactics did develop gradually throughout the Anglo-Saxon period. Though there is still much debate as to how efficient the soldiers and the fighting was, it is clear that, as the ages progressed, so too did the power and capability of the army.

He was for twenty years (1893‚Äì1913) a member of the United States House of Representatives, and the 47th Governor of Massachusetts, serving three one-year terms (1916‚Äì19). He was a moderately progressive Republican who sought to counteract the influence of money in politics. Born in Pennsylvania and educated at Dartmouth, he settled in Massachusetts, where he entered local politics on a progressive reform agenda. Elected to Congress, he continued his reform activities, and opposed annexation of The Philippines. He did not join the Progressive Party, but was insufficiently conservative for state party leaders, who denied him election to the United States Senate on two occasions. As governor, he directed the state's actions during World War I, and orchestrated early aid to Halifax, Nova Scotia following a devastating munitions ship explosion there in 1917. Early years and education Samuel Walker McCall was born in East Providence Township, Pennsylvania on February 28, 1851, to Henry and Mary Ann (Elliott) McCall, the sixth of eleven children.Evans, p. 2 At a young age, the family moved to an undeveloped frontier area of northern Illinois, where McCall spent much of his childhood.Evans, p. 3 McCall's father speculated in real estate and owned a stove factory, which was closed by financial reverses of the Panic of 1857.Gentile, p. 835 His education began at the Mount Carroll Seminary (now Shimer College) in Mount Carroll from 1864 to 1866,Evans, p. 7 when that school closed to male students. McCall's parents then sent him east to the New Hampton Academy in New Hampton, New Hampshire, on the recommendation of a neighbor. McCall graduated from New Hampton Academy in 1870 and subsequently attended Dartmouth College, where he was a member of the Kappa Kappa Kappa fraternity and graduated Phi Beta Kappa near the top of his class. While at Dartmouth, he published a newspaper (self-financed by himself and the other editors) called the Anvil, and was tapped by the Dartmouth president to stand in for a sick teacher of Latin and Greek at an academy in Meriden, New Hampshire.Evans, pp. 14‚Äì16 The Anvil was one of the first student-run newspapers to comment on national and state politics. After graduating, McCall moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he studied law and gained admission to the Massachusetts Bar. He then opened a law practice in Boston with a Dartmouth classmate,Evans, p. 18 which he maintained for most of his life. In 1888, he and two partners purchased the Boston Daily Advertiser, for which he served as editor-in-chief for two years.Gentile, p. 836 In 1881 he married Ella Esther Thompson, whom he met while attending New Hampton Academy;Evans, p. 10 they settled in Winchester, Massachusetts, where they raised five children.Toomey & Quinn, p. 109 Legislative career McCall was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1887, serving three terms in 1888, 1889, and 1892. Politically a reform-minded Mugwump (he had supported Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884), he introduced legislation to govern so-called \\"corrupt practices\\" of elected officials, intended to reduce the influence of money and favors in politics.Sobel, p. 89Abrams, p. 270 The legislation failed to pass the legislature until 1892.Evans, pp. 24, 27 He also supported legislation abolishing imprisonment for debt. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888,Evans, p. 23 and served as the state's ballot commissioner in 1890 and 1891. In 1892, McCall was elected to the United States House of Representatives, a seat he would occupy for twenty years,Evans, p. 28 generally winning reelection by large margins. As he had in the state legislature, he introduced a corrupt practices act into Congress. In foreign policy, he was anti-imperialist, arguing for the independence of The Philippines after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War,Abrams, p. 30 and opposed the Dingley Tariff, arguing its rates were too high. He was one of the few representatives opposed to the Hepburn Act, which enabled the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates.Abrams, pp. 126‚Äì127 He had a reputation as a bit of a maverick, because he often strayed from the Republican party line, but he maintained a generally conservative voting record, and introduced little new legislation. In 1912, McCall refused to stand for reelection, and was instead considered by the state legislature for election to the United States Senate in early 1913, to succeed the outgoing Senator Winthrop Murray Crane. His opponent, John W. Weeks, was more conservative Republican who had the support of most of the Crane-dominated state party apparatus. The contest was bitterly divisive, an echo of the Progressive Party split that damaged the party at the national level, and was narrowly won by Weeks,Sobel, pp. 78‚Äì79 even though McCall led in the party caucus balloting for the first three ballots. Governor of Massachusetts Governor McCall in 1916 McCall was chosen by the party in 1914 as its nominee for Governor of Massachusetts, as a unifying force between the more progressive and conservative wings of the party. Running against the popular Democratic incumbent David I. Walsh on a progressive platform, McCall was narrowly defeated,Sobel, pp. 89‚Äì90 with the Republican votes split due to the presence of a Progressive Party candidate on the ballot. McCall was nominated again in 1915, with the Republicans deliberately courting the Progressive vote by calling for a state constitutional convention. In a rematch with Walsh, he was this time victorious. He served three consecutive terms, with future President Calvin Coolidge as his lieutenant governor. In each election, Coolidge won more votes than McCall did, and the Boston Transcript credited at least one of his victories to Coolidge's drawing power.Sobel, pp. 101, 107-109 Governor McCall speaking in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, with Lt. Governor Calvin Coolidge in background (1918) McCall viewing reconstruction efforts in visiting Halifax, Nova Scotia, after the Halifax Explosion (November 1918) The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917‚Äì1918 was the major political event of McCall's tenure. The convention proposed a number of reforms, most of which were adopted by the voters. State commissions and agencies were streamlined, and initiative and referendum measures were added to the state constitution. Elections for statewide offices were changed from annual to biennial, beginning in 1920. Legislative reforms proposed by McCall to the state legislature were only partially adopted; proposals reforming state insurance and the public pension program were left in the legislature, and his proposal to abolish capital punishment also failed. Anticipating American entry into World War I in early 1917, McCall formed the Massachusetts Public Safety Commission,Lyman, p. 3 an emergency response and relief organization that was the first of its type in the nation.MacDonald, p. 105 Coordinating a wide array of public and charitable organizations and major businesses, the commission played a significant role in providing relief and other services until it was disbanded in 1918.See Lyman for a description of the commission activities. One of its most important actions was coordinating the state's response to the Halifax Explosion of December 6, 1917. With only fragmentary reports received early after a blast devastated the Nova Scotia city of Halifax, McCall called the committee into action, and offered unlimited assistance to the stricken city. The state organized a major relief train (even before the full extent of the disaster was known) that was among the first to reach Halifax, and the committee's representatives assisted in organizing relief activities on the ground.MacDonald, pp. 105-106, 142, 173-183 Temporary housing built in Halifax was named in McCall's honor, and the state's relief efforts continue to be recognized today by Nova Scotia's annual gift of a Christmas tree to the city of Boston.MacDonald, pp. 273-274 In 1918, McCall decided not to run for reelection, and again stood for the United States Senate. In a party nomination rematch with Weeks, he abandoned the campaign after it became clear the conservative Crane wing of the party was standing with Weeks. The seat ended up being won by ex-Governor Walsh in a Democratic upset.Sobel, pp. 109-110 In the general election, McCall refused to campaign on Weeks' behalf, a move that contributed to the end of his political career. In 1920, he was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson for a seat on the United States Tariff Commission; the nomination was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate.Gentile, p. 837 Later years McCall was engaged in literary pursuits for much of his public career, writing in various newspapers and magazines. Following his exit from politics he continued to do so, writing for the Atlantic Monthly magazine, and working on political biographies. His published writings include biographies of his mentor Thomas Brackett Reed, and of Pennsylvania congressman Thaddeus Stevens. Additionally, he was working in a biography of Daniel Webster at the time of his death. McCall died in Winchester on November 4, 1923. His interment was in Wildwood Cemetery. Winchester's McCall Middle School is named in his honor. McCall's grandson, Tom McCall, was a two-term Republican Governor of Oregon, serving from 1967 to 1975.

It was the third tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over a week in the central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores. Just before becoming extratropical, it affected the Azores on September 30, although no damage was reported. Meteorological history The origins of the system was a cold front that moved off the U.S. East Coast on September 11. The front moved gradually off the coast and into the subtropical Atlantic Ocean before becoming stationary just east of Bermuda on September 15. Over the next two days, the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right. On the afternoon of September 17, the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four. The depression organized steadily that evening and into the morning of September 18\\\\. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast. Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes, Bonnie was embedded in a larger-scale cyclonic circulation at first, which minimized shear (allowing it to develop) and provided weak steering currents. The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well-defined eye formed late that morning. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean. The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane. In addition, Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September 19 as steering currents slowly developed. Bonnie strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale that morning as well, peaking at 105 mph (165 km/h) with a 970 mbar central pressure. The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September 20, when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly, although remaining a Category 2 hurricane. Early on September 21, the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion. That afternoon, the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a central pressure of 965 mbar, just under Category 3 intensity. Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22, when it began to weaken very gradually and level off. Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid-latitude ridge of high pressure, which stalled the motion. Bonnie remained virtually stationary until the morning of September 23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest in response to the ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September 24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September 25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression. Space Shuttle Endeavour The weakening trend ended early on September 26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, turning to the southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September 27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September 28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September 29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September 30 as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, just east of the Azores. The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October 2. Impact When Bonnie passed over the Azores only four days after Charley, it resulted in tropical storm- force winds across much of the island chain. Lajes Air Base reported sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) with gusts to 59 mph (94 km/h). In addition, one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of S√£o Miguel. No damage was reported in the Azores.

Getting and Bradford Parkinson. He was born in Craftsbury, Vermont. Career In 1955, Easton co-wrote the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard proposal for a U.S. satellite program in competition with two other proposals, including a proposal from the U.S. Army prepared by Wernher Von Braun. The Eisenhower Administration selected Project Vanguard. In 1957, Easton invented the Minitrack tracking system to determine the Vanguard satellite's orbit. When Sputnik I was launched, Easton extended the system to actively follow unknown orbiting satellites. In 1959, he designed the Naval Space Surveillance (NAVSPASUR) system. The Naval Space Surveillance System became the first system to detect and track all types of Earth-orbiting objects. It goes through the 33rd parallel, which is effectively coast to coast of the US. Later in his career at NRL, Easton conceived, patented, and led the development of essential enabling technologies for the United States Global Positioning System (GPS). During the 1960s and early 1970s he developed a time-based navigational system with passive ranging, circular orbits, and space-borne high precision clocks placed in satellites. The idea was tested with four experimental satellites: TIMATION I and II (in 1967 and 1969) and Navigation Technology Satellites (NTS) 1 and 2 (in 1974 and 1977). NTS-2 was the first satellite to transmit GPS signals. Personal life Easton was born in Craftsbury, Vermont, to Dr. Frank B. Easton, a physician, and Della Donnocker, a school teacher. He graduated from Middlebury College in 1943. He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943. At the Naval Research Laboratory he worked in the Radio Division on radar beacons and blind-landing systems. Easton also worked in the laboratory's Rocket-Sonde Branch which was dealing with space related research. Easton retired in 1980. In 1986, Easton ran for Governor and served 3 terms on the Board of the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative. Easton died on May 8, 2014, at the age of 93. Awards George W. Bush awarded Easton the National Medal of Technology for his \\"extensive pioneering achievements in spacecraft tracking, navigation and timing technology that led to the development of the NAVSTAR-Global Positioning System (GPS)\\" in 2006. The National Medal of Technology is the highest honor awarded for technology. On March 31, 2010, Easton was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and presented the NIHF Medal of Honor for the development of TIMed navigATION (TIMATION - U.S. Patent 3,789,409) that provided both accurate position and precise time to terrestrial based observers, an important foundation for contemporary Global Positioning Systems.Naval Research Laboratory (NRL Press Release 34-10r 03/31/2010): Father of GPS and Pioneer of Satellite Telemetry and Timing Inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame During his career at the Naval Research Laboratory, Easton was awarded: * The Distinguished Civilian Service Award (1960) * The Institute of Navigation's Colonel Thomas L.

Appearance The setae of this species have a uniformly rusty appearance. The coloration is very similar to that of the six species of Brachypelma that are endemic to the west coast. B. boehmei is similar, having black tarsi, orange-yellow metatarsi, tibias and patellas, black femora and coxae and orange-yellow hairs on the opistosoma. It differs only in the carapace, which is yellow-orange in B. boehmei and black in B. klaasi. Another very similar species is B. baumgarteni. Adults of B. klaasi have a body length of about 6‚Äì7.5 cm with a 16 cm legspan. Name The species is named in honor of Peter Klaas, the collector of the species. Distribution B. klaasi is found at elevations of 300‚Äì1400 m above sea level on the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental and some areas on the western limits of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in Jalisco and Nayarit states. Its known range extends from Tepic, Nayarit, in the north to Chamela, Jalisco, in the south, with the largest known population at the biological reserve at Chamela. Conservation There is a high rate of collection for the pet trade of B. klaasi and other members of the genus Brachypelma. As such, all members of Brachypelma have been placed on Appendix II of CITES. B. klaasi is considered to be the rarest and most threatened of the Mexican tarantula species. Their slow growth, combined with habitat degradation and illegal wild capture for the pet trade means that it is estimated that less than 0.1% of individual tarantulas survive from egg to adulthood in the wild. Temperature and humidity may influence the survival and development of eggs and spiderlings, and appear to be more important in governing the distribution of B. klaasi than are food resources or intra-specific interactions.

AMS advocates for the Montessori method (popularized by Maria Montessori) throughout the United States, and publishes its own standards and criteria for its accredited member schools. AMS supports research and public policy that advocate for Montessori education. History  = Founder: Nancy McCormick Rambusch = In the 1950s, the cultural climate around the traditional American education was changing as people become discontent with the status quo. Among those seeking alternatives was Dr. Nancy McCormick Rambusch, a young teacher from New York City. In 1953, Rambusch‚Äôs quest for a better approach to educating American children took her to Paris, France for the Tenth International Montessori Congress, where she met Mario Montessori, Maria Montessori‚Äôs son. Mario worked in the movement, fulfilling his mother's legacy, as head of the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), an organization she had founded to support the Montessori Movement. Mario urged Rambusch to take coursework in Montessori education and to bring the Montessori Method to the United States. Within a few years, Rambusch was conducting Montessori classes for her own children, and others, in her New York City apartment. In 1956, the Rambusch family moved to Greenwich, CT. There, Nancy became involved with a group of parents who wanted to be involved with their children‚Äôs education. In 1958, they founded Whitby School‚Äîthe first Montessori school to open in the United States since the initial flurry of interest in Montessori in the early 20th century. The board selected Rambusch as head of school. Rambusch was appointed the American representative of the Association Montessori Internationale by Mario Montessori. The Association Montessori Internationale is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Six months later, Rambusch founded the American Montessori Society with the goal of redefining educational options in the United States. = Beginnings of American Montessori Society = The goals of AMS mirrored those of AMI: to support efforts to create schools, develop teacher education programs, and publicize the value of Montessori education. In 1961, TIME magazine featured Rambusch, Whitby School, and the American Montessori revival in its May 12 issue. The article galvanized the American public, and parents turned to AMS in large numbers for advice on starting schools and study groups. Additional publicity in the media, including Newsweek, the New York Times, and the Saturday Evening Post, as well as the publication in 1962 of Rambusch‚Äôs book, Learning How to Learn, led to growth in the number of American Montessori schools and students. From the beginning, Rambusch and AMS worked to advance Montessori education into mid-20th century American culture. AMS insisted that all teacher educators have a college degree so that the coursework could, potentially, be recognized by state education departments. AMS also broadened the curriculum for teachers and sought to connect with mainstream education by offering Montessori coursework in traditional teacher preparation programs. Nancy Rambusch believed there was a need for cultural accommodation. Professor John J. McDermott, a colleague and friend, agreed, arguing that the popular idea of the universality of children displayed a basic naivet√© about the interrelationships between a culture and the child‚Äôs development of consciousness. McDermott also stressed the need to move Montessori into the public sector so that it would be available to all children, regardless of their circumstances‚Äîa conviction that remains a vital underpinning of the organization, along with a belief in the need for adaptability. = Archives = The American Montessori Society Archives are housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. The multi-media collection reflects the professional and administrative activities of AMS going back to its earliest days, and also provides historical information about the Montessori system of education.  AMS-Affiliated Teacher Education Programs  Teacher education programs (TEPs) affiliated with the American Montessori Society provide courses for people who want to be Montessori teachers.  Use of Montessori terminology  In 1967, the US Patent Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled that \\"the term 'Montessori' has a generic and/or descriptive significance.\\"[29] Therefore, in the United States and around the world, the term can be used freely without giving any guarantee of how closely, if at all, a program applies Montessori's work. The ruling has led to \\"tremendous variation in schools claiming to use Maria Montessori‚Äôs methods.\\"[30]  See also  *Montessori in the United States *Association Montessori International of the United States *Maria Montessori *Montessori education References   American Montessori Society, Inc. v.

Legend The Chonchon is the magical transformation of a kalku (Mapuche sorcerer). It is said only the most powerful kalkus can aspire to master the secret of becoming this feared creature. The kalku or sorcerer would carry out the transformation into a Chonchon by an act of will and being anointed by a magical cream in the throat that eases the removal of the head from the rest of the body, with the removed head then becoming the creature. The Chonchon has the shape of a human head with feathers and talons; its ears, which are extremely large, serve as wings for its flight on moonless nights. Chonchons are supposed to be endowed with all the magic powers of, and can only be seen by, other kalkus, or by wizards that want this power. Sorcerers take the form of the chonchon to better carry out their wicked activities, and the transformation would provide them with other abilities, such as drinking the blood of ill or sleeping people. Although the fearsome appearance of a chonchon would be invisible to the uninitiated, they would still be able to hear its characteristic cry of \\"tue tue tue\\", which is considered to be an extremely ill omen, usually predicting the death of a loved one.

The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martin's Tower to the bank of the River Corrib, as a measure to protect the city's quays, which were in the area once known as the Fish Market (now Spanish Parade). It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584, being called ceann an bhalla (the head of the wall). In the 18th century the Eyre family of Eyrecourt, County Galway, created an extension of the quays called The Long Walk and created the arches to allow access from the town to the new quays.

Ballyknow Quay, Claddagh, Galway, with The Long Walk in the background In 1755, the arches were partially destroyed by the tsunami generated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Until 2006, part of the Arch housed the Galway City Museum. At that time, the museum was moved to a new, dedicated building located just behind the Arch.

Pulse shaping can be used to shorten/elongate the duration of optical pulse, or to generate complex pulses. Introduction Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of a Pulse Shaper Generation of sequences of ultrashort optical pulses is key in realizing ultra high speed optical networks, Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) systems, chemical and biological reaction triggering and monitoring etc. Based on the requirement, pulse shapers may be designed to stretch, compress or produce a train of pulses from a single input pulse. The ability to produce trains of pulses with femtosecond or picosecond separation implies transmission of optical information at very high speeds. In ultrafast laser science pulse shapers are often used as a complement to pulse compressors in order to fine- tune high-order dispersion compensation and achieve transform-limited few- cycle optical pulses. Techniques A pulse shaper may be visualized as a modulator. The input pulse is multiplied with a modulating function to get a desired output pulse. The modulating function in pulse shapers may be in time domain or a frequency domain (obtained by Fourier Transform of time profile of pulse). However, application of direct pulse shaping technique on a femtosecond time scale faces the same problem as direct femtosecond pulse measurement: electronics speed limitations. Michelson interferometer can be regarded as direct space-to-time pulse shaper since position of the moving mirror is directly transferred to the inter-pulse delay of the output pulse pair. =Fourier transform pulse shaping= An ultrashort pulse with a well- defined electrical field E(t) can be modified with an appropriate filter acting in the frequency domain. Mathematically, the pulse is Fourier transformed, filtered, and back-transformed to yield a new pulse: :E'(t)=\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\\\\\{E(t)\\\\\\\\}(\\\\omega)f(\\\\omega)\\\\\\\\}(t). It is possible to design an optical setup with an arbitrary filter function f(\\\\omega) which can be complex-valued, as long as f(\\\\omega)\\\\le1. Figure 1 shows how a bandwidth-limited pulse could be transformed into a chirped pulse (with a filter only acting on the phase) or into a more complex pulse (with the filter acting on both phase and amplitude). Design One can distinguish FT pulse shapers by their optical design: i.e., collinear shapers and transverse shapers, and by their programmability, i.e., static (or manually adjustable) shapers and programmable shapers. Examples *Collinear static: propagation in dispersive medium, chirped mirror *Collinear programmable: AOPDF *Transverse static: pulse stretcher/compressor (static mask in Fourier plane can be added for amplitude shaping) *Transverse programmable: spatial light modulator inserted in a zero-dispersion line See also * Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS), a method to characterize and manipulate the ultrashort pulse * Acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter (AOPDF), a collinear-beam acousto-optic modulator capable of shaping spectral phase and amplitude of ultrashort laser pulses * Chirped mirror Notes Further reading  Category:Laser science ","title":"Femtosecond pulse shaping"},{"id":"7720979","text":"Emil Viklick√Ω in 2007 Emil Viklick√Ω (born November 23, 1948 in Olomouc) is a Czech jazz pianist and composer. Career Viklick√Ω graduated from Palack√Ω University in 1971 with a degree in mathematics. As a student he devoted a lot of time to playing jazz piano, and in 1974, he was awarded the prize for best soloist at the Czechoslovak Amateur Jazz Festival. The same year he joined Karel Velebn√Ω's SHQ ensemble. In 1976, he was a prizewinner at a jazz improvisation competition in Lyon, and his composition \\"Green Satin\\" () won first prize in a music conservatory competition in Monaco. In 1985 his composition \\"Cacharel\\" won second prize in the same competition. In 1977 he was awarded a year's scholarship to study composition and arrangement with Herb Pomeroy at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He then continued his composition studies with Jarmo Sermila, George Crumb and V√°clav Kuƒçera. Since returning to Prague, he has led his own ensembles (primarily quartets and quintets), composed and arranged, and - after the death of Karel Velebn√Ω - worked as director of the Summer Jazz Workshops in Fr√Ωdlant. He has lectured at a similar workshop event in Glamorgan, Wales. Between 1991 and 1995, Viklick√Ω was President of the Czech Jazz Society, and since 1994 he has worked with the Ad lib Moravia ensemble, whose performances combine elements of Moravian folk music, modern jazz and contemporary serious music. In 1996, the ensemble went on a concert tour of Mexico and the United States. =As a pianist= Emil Viklick√Ω in Budapest As a pianist, Viklick√Ω has performed in numerous international ensembles alongside musicians from the U.S. and other European countries, including the Lou Blackburn International Quartet, the Benny Bailey Quintet, and multi-instrumentalist Scott Robinson. He has made frequent appearances in Finland (with the Finnczech Quartet and in particular with Jarmo Sermila) and Norway (with the Czech-Norwegian Big Band and ) and has performed in the USA, Japan, Mexico, Israel, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands (at the North Sea Festival) and elsewhere. He has also worked with fellow Czech, saxophonist Jaroslav Jakuboviƒç, and often accompanied Czech jazz singer Eva Olmerov√°, during the last years of her career. =As a composer= As a composer, Viklick√Ω has attracted attention abroad primarily for having created a synthesis of the expressive elements of modern jazz with the melodicism and tonalities of Moravian folk song that is distinctly individual in contemporary jazz. Besides this, however, he also composes ‚Äústraight-ahead‚Äù modern jazz as well as chamber and orchestral works that utilize certain elements of the New Music, and at times his music requires a combination of classical and jazz performers. He also composes incidental and film music and has produced scores for several full-length feature films (e.g. the German horror comedy Killer Condom) and television series. Throughout the 1990s he devoted an increasing amount of time to the composition of contemporary classical music for a great variety of instrumental combinations ranging from small chamber ensembles and electronic instruments to symphony orchestras and choruses. Awards Viklick√Ω's work has gained him a number of awards. These include second prize in the 1985 Monaco jazz composition competition (for \\"Cacharel\\"), the 1991 Film and Television Association prize for music for animated film, second prize at the 1994 Marimolin contemporary music competition in Boston (for \\"Tristana\\"), a 1996 Prague award for electroacoustic music (for \\"Paradise Park\\"), a 1996 Czech Music Fund prize for use of folk music in art music, and first prize in a 2000 international composition competition in Prague (for the opera Phaedra).

A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880‚Äì1920. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. George Washington and Henry Knox were first to propose, in an American context, the cultural transformation of Native Americans. They formulated a policy to encourage the so-called civilizing process. With increased waves of immigration from Europe, there was growing public support for education to encourage a standard set of cultural values and practices to be held in common by the majority of citizens. Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities. Americanization policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society. After the end of the Indian Wars, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies. It established Native American boarding schools which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind. The Dawes Act of 1887, which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans. Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions. It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of from Native American control. Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations. The leading opponent of forced assimilation was John Collier, who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies. Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601‚Äì1776 Eastern North America; the 1763 \\"Proclamation line\\" is the border between the red and the pink areas. Epidemiological and archeological work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634‚Äì1640. They came from areas where smallpox was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people. Tribes such as the Huron/Wendat and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.Gary Warrick, \\"European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)\\", World Archaeology 35 (October 2003), 258‚Äì275. During this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas. The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles. In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries. To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence. In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and gun trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc. Many Native American tribes took part in King William's War (1689‚Äì1697), Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì1713) (War of the Spanish Succession), Dummer's War (c. 1721‚Äì1725), and the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) (Seven Years' War). As the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the Royal Proclamation of 1763, to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the Appalachian Mountains. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community. In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward. The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists. Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see European colonization of the Americas. From the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land. The United States and Native Americans, 1776‚Äì1860 Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins demonstrating European methods of farming to Creek (Muscogee) on his Georgia plantation situated along the Flint River, 1805 The struggle for empire in North America caused the United States in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by Great Britain in colonial times.Fritz, Henry E. (1963). The Movement for Indian in 1860‚Äì1890. University of Pennsylvania Press. They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to \\"woo\\" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States. Now, instead of a buffer against other \\"civilized\\" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States. George Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \\"civilizing\\" process. He had a six-point plan for civilization which included: # impartial justice toward Native Americans # regulated buying of Native American lands # promotion of commerce # promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society # presidential authority to give presents # punishing those who violated Native American rights. Robert Remini, a historian, wrote that \\"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans\\". The United States appointed agents, like Benjamin Hawkins, to live among the Native Americans and to teach them how to live like whites. =Indian removal= The Indian Removal Act of 1830 characterized the US government policy of Indian removal, which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored. On September 27, 1830, the Choctaws signed Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory. While the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials. The best-known example is the Treaty of New Echota. It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of Cherokee tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.Hoxie, Frederick (1984). A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880‚Äì1920. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the Trail of Tears. In the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers. =Office of Indian Affairs= The Office of Indian Affairs (Bureau of Indian Affairs as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the United States Department of War, an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the Department of the Interior as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets. In 1854 Commissioner George W. Manypenny called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions. In 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, Charles Mix, noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior Caleb B. Smith questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations. Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead. Americanization and assimilation (1857‚Äì1920) Portrait of Marsdin, non- native man, and group of students from the Alaska region The movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves \\"Friends of the Indian\\" and lobbied officials on their behalf. Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers. Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved. The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people. In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.Robert H. Keller, American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82 (1983) =Grant's \\"Peace Policy\\"= In his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, Ulysses Grant stated that \\"the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\\"http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.Cary C. Collins, \\"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869‚Äì1882\\", Pacific Northwest Forum (1995) 8#2 pp 55‚Äì77 The Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869‚Äì1885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.Joseph E. Illick, \\"'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration\\", Western Historical Quarterly (1971) 2#3 pp. 283‚Äì294 in JSTOR Many other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the Pima reservation in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.Robert A. Trennert, \\"John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas\\", Arizona & the West (1986) 28#1 pp. 45‚Äì68 In Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo. However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.Norman Bender, New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s (1989) The peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/ Reaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.Brian W. Dippie, What Will Congress Do About It?' The Congressional Reaction to the Little Big Horn Disaster\\", North Dakota History (1970) 37#3 pp. 161‚Äì189 =Code of Indian Offenses= In 1882, Interior Secretary Henry M. Teller called attention to the \\"great hindrance\\" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation. The resultant \\"Code of Indian Offenses\\" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing \\"evil practice.\\" A Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency. The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders. Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor. Also prohibited were \\"medicine men\\" who \\"use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs.\\" The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian- offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011 The Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.http://tribal- law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011 In implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes. The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or \\"heathenish ceremonies.\\"Report of the Secretary of the Interior, Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix. Significantly, 1890 was the year of the Ghost Dance, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre. = The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation = In 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney expressed that since Native Americans were \\"free and independent people\\" that they could become U.S. citizens. Taney asserted that Native Americans could be naturalized and join the \\"political community\\" of the United States. The political ideas during the time of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the progressive era, but more commonly known as the assimilation era.(1890‚Äì1928Hoxie, Frederick E. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. New York: St. Martin's. 2001. (178) Print.). The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world.Tomlins, Christopher L. The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (175‚Äì176) Print. This idea is applied to Native Americans in a quote from Indian Affairs Commissioner John Oberly: \\"[The Native American] must be imbued with the exalting egotism of American civilization so that he will say ‚ÄòI‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòWe‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThis is mine‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòThis is ours‚Äô.\\"Wilkins, David E. American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: The Masking of Justice. University of Texas Press, 1997. (78‚Äì81) Print. Progressives also had faith in the knowledge of experts. This was a dangerous idea to have when an emerging science was concerned with ranking races based on moral capabilities and intelligence.Tomlins, Christopher L. The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print. Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts. The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness. Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American. These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era. Cases such as Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, Talton v. Mayes, Winters vs. The United States, United States v. Winans, United States v. Nice, and United States v. Sandoval provide excellent examples of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as they refer back to the idea of Indians as \\"wards of the nation\\".http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol;=187&invol;=553 Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions. Native American nations were labeled \\"domestic dependent nations\\" by Marshall in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print. Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.  Decisions focusing on dependence  =United States vs. Kagama= The United States Supreme Court case United States v. Kagama (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power. To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated: The decision in United States v. Kagama led to the new idea that \\"protection\\" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society. =United States v. Nice= During the years leading up to passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, United States v. Nice (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of liquor. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, Matter of Heff, , which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor. The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.Canby Jr., William. American Indian Law In a Nut Shell, 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print. The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection. =United States v. Sandoval= Like United States v. Nice, the United States Supreme Court case of United States v. Sandoval (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor. As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens. The Sandoval Act reversed the U.S. v. Joseph decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were \\"not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution\\".Red Man's Land White Man's Land 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995, p. 141 This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.  Decisions focusing on sovereignty  There were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the sovereignty of American Indian nations. These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations. =Ex parte Crow Dog (1883)= Ex parte Crow Dog was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian. Crow Dog argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation. The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. ¬ß 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. ¬ß 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe. The Court issued the writs of habeas corpus and certiorari to the Indian.Ex parte Crow Dog, =Talton v. Mayes (1896)= The United States Supreme Court case of Talton v. Mayes was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 Cherokee Nation v. Georgia case, that gave Indian tribes the status of \\"domestic dependent nations\\", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.\\"Full text opinion from Justia.com\\" Talton v. Mayes is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. =Good Shot v. United States (1900)= This United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.\\"Good Shot v. United States. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009. =Montoya v. United States (1901)= This United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya & Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \\"Victorio's Band\\" which was a group of these American Indians. It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another. One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.\\"Montoya v. United States\\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009. =US v. Winans (1905)= In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and \\"as justice and reason demand\\".Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association, 443 U.S. 658, 668 Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \\"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\\".Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics, p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. These \\"reserved\\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights. Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations, tax, administer justice, or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction.Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K. Tsianina (2002). Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law, p. 125. University of Oklahoma Press. =Winters v. United States (1908)= The United States Supreme Court case Winters v. United States was a case primarily dealing with water rights of American Indian reservations. This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had \\"implied\\" rights to put to use.Duthu, N. (2008). \\"American Indians and the Law\\", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. . This case dealt with the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation and their right to utilize the water source of the Milk River in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had. This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.Shurts, John (2000). \\"Indian Reserved Water Rights\\", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the Supreme Court came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases Arizona v. California, Tulee v. Washington, Washington v. McCoy, Nevada v. United States, Cappaert v. United States, Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, United States v. New Mexico, and Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes. =Choate v. Trapp (1912)= As more Native Americans received allotments through the Dawes Act, there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees. However, in the United States Supreme court case Choate v. Trapp, , the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation.Wilkins, David, and K. Tsianina Lomawaima. Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law. University of Oklahoma Press, 2001. (151) Print. =Clairmont v. United States (1912)= This United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.\\"Clairmont v. United States\\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009. =United States v. Quiver (1916)= This case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a Sioux Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now ¬ß 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.\\"United States v. Quiver\\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009. Native American education and boarding schools =Non-reservation boarding schools= In 1634, Fr. Andrew White of the Society of Jesus established a mission in what is now the state of Maryland, and the purpose of the mission, stated through an interpreter to the chief of an Indian tribe there, was \\"to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race, and show them the way to heaven\\".Foley, Henry. Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. p. 352. The mission's annual records report that by 1640, a community had been founded which they named St. Mary's, and the Indians were sending their children there \\"to be educated among the English\\".Foley, Henry. Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. p. 379 This included the daughter of the Pascatoe Indian chief Tayac, which exemplified, or an early co-ed school. The same records report that in 1677, \\"a school for humanities was opened by our Society in the centre of [Maryland], directed by two of the Fathers; and the native youth, applying themselves assiduously to study, made good progress. Maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to St. Omer who yielded in abilities to few Europeans, when competing for the honour of being first in their class. So that not gold, nor silver, nor the other products of the earth alone, but men also are gathered from thence to bring those regions, which foreigners have unjustly called ferocious, to a higher state of virtue and cultivation.\\"Foley, Henry. Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. p. 394 In 1727, the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula founded Ursuline Academy in New Orleans, which is currently the oldest, continuously-operating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States. From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African- American slaves and free women of color. Male Carlisle School students (1879) The Carlisle Indian Industrial School founded by Richard Henry Pratt in 1879 was the first Indian boarding school established. Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education. When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as Hampton Institute. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society. Pratt professed \\"assimilation through total immersion\\". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families. Carlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation. Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900) Once the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments. Additionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low. Native American group of Carlisle Indian Industrial School male and female students; brick dormitories and bandstand in background (1879) An Indian boarding school was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate Native American youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught Christianity instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in North Dakota. By 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.Carolyn Marr, \\"Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest\\", University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.Colmant, S.A. (2000). \\"U.S. and Canadian Boarding Schools: A Review, Past and Present\\", Native Americas Journal,17 (4), 24‚Äì30. Enrollment reached its highest point in the 1970s. In 1973, 60,000 American Indian children were estimated to have been enrolled in an Indian boarding school.Colmant, S.A. (2000). \\"U.S. and Canadian Boarding Schools: A Review, Past and Present\\", Native Americas Journal, 17 (4), 24‚Äì30C. Hammerschlag; C.P. Alderfer; and D.

Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted. It recommended: * abolishing the \\"Uniform Course of Study\\", which taught only majority American cultural values; * having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non- reservation schools; and * ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society. =Indian New Deal= John Collier, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933‚Äì1945, set the priorities of the New Deal policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self- government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them. Collier's 1920‚Äì 1922 visit to Taos Pueblo had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \\"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless\\".John Collier, \\"Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?\\" The American Magazine of Art. Anniversary Supplement vol. 27, no. 9, Part 2 (1934): 10‚Äì13 Collier came under attack for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity.Stephen J. Kunitz, \\"The social philosophy of John Collier.\\" Ethnohistory (1971): 213‚Äì229. in JSTOR Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier \\"made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity. ... His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life.\\"Kenneth R. Philp. \\"Collier, John\\". American National Biography Online, February 2000. Accessed May 5, 2015. Collier carried through the Indian New Deal with Congress' passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler‚ÄìHoward Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian self-determination and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887. Collier was also responsible for getting the Johnson‚ÄìO'Malley Act passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations. The act was effective only in Minnesota. Collier's support of the Navajo Livestock Reduction program resulted in Navajo opposition to the Indian New Deal.Peter Iverson, Din√©: A History of the Navajos (2002) p 144Donald A. Grinde Jr, \\"Navajo Opposition to the Indian New Deal.\\" Integrated Education (1981) 19#3-6 pp: 79‚Äì87. The Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a \\"dictator\\" and accused him of a \\"near reign of terror\\" on the Navajo reservation.Brian W. Dippie, The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy (1991) pp 333‚Äì336, quote p 335 According to historian Brian Dippie, \\"(Collier) became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him.\\" =Change to community schools= Several events in the late 1960s and mid-1970s (Kennedy Report, National Study of American Indian Education, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975) led to renewed emphasis on community schools. Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory. From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day, more than 100,000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school. A similar system in Canada was known as the Canadian residential school system.Andrea Smith, \\"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools\\" , Amnesty Magazine, Amnesty International website Lasting effects of the Americanization policy While the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially, integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day. Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \\"white\\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them. In the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, shows this: Since the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy. Similarly the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it. As of 2013, \\"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\\" The \\"Indian Education for All\\" curriculum, created by the Montana Office of Public Instruction, is distributed online for primary and secondary schools. Modern cultural and linguistic preservation To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.Kituwah Preservation & Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012. Print. There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade. Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English. The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school's sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading. The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low- performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School. Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state's A‚ÄìF report card system. The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance. \\"The C we made is tremendous,\\" said school principal Holly Davis, \\"[t]here is no English instruction in our school's younger grades, and we gave them this test in English.\\" She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school's first year as a state-funded charter school, and many students had difficulty with English. Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend Sequoyah High School where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee.

He attended Grants Pass High, where he joined the school's wrestling and football teams.Eugene Register-Guard article: \\"People In Sports.\\" Sherk attended Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen, Washington and Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. During high school, he played on both the football and wrestling teams in both his junior and senior years. He was an All-Big Eight selection on the gridiron in 1969 and an All-American as a Cowboy grappler in 1969. He was inducted to the Oklahoma State Hall of Honor in 2000. He was the key to the Grays Harbor wrestling teams winning wrestling state titles two years in a row. Individually, he also won back-to-back state titles and in 1968, he pinned every opponent he faced.  NFL career  Sherk was selected in the second round (47th overall) of the 1970 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns.The Palm Beach Post article: \\"Browns' Sherk Retires to Pursue Photography.\\" His first game was on September 21, 1970, the first regular edition of Monday Night Football.Montreal Gazette article: \\"Cosell: Monday night football had rocky start.\\" He became a starting player immediately, and soon became noted as having a knack for getting to the quarterback.The Plain Dealer article: \\"When They Played the Game: Browns defensive lineman Jerry Sherk.\\" Sherk was part of an AFC Central Division in which each team boasted All-Pro quality defensive tackles: the Pittsburgh Steelers' Joe Greene, the Cincinnati Bengals' Mike Reid, and the Houston Oilers' Curley Culp. He was part of a 1972 Browns team that went 10-4 and advanced to the playoffs, losing to the undefeated Miami Dolphins. Sherk led the Browns in sacks with 10¬Ω sacks and led teams' defensive linemen in tackles with 91, after totaling three sacks and 83 tackles in 1970 and 84 tackles with four 1/2 sacks in 1971. The following year Sherk played in his first Pro Bowl after sacking opposing quarterbacks 5¬Ω times and making 100 tackles, most by any Brown defensive lineman that season. In 1974 Sherk made his second Pro Bowl and led the Browns with 10 sacks to go with his 94 tackles. In 1975 Sherk made his third consecutive Pro Bowl and was named All-AFC. He matched his own career-high of 100 tackles and recorded six sacks. In 1976 Sherk recorded 12 sacks and 92 tackles and was voted the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). Sherk was a consensus All-Pro, making the AP, PFWA, NEA teams as well as being consensus All-AFC for the second consecutive year. November 14, 1976 he set club record with four sacks in one game. He capped the season off by playing in his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. At a September 1977 preseason match against the Green Bay Packers, Sherk seriously injured his knee.Pittsburgh Press article: \\"Browns Sherk Injured.\\" Consequently, he was only able to play in seven games during the 1977 season.NFL.com page: \\"Jerry Sherk ‚Äì 1977 stats. He came back in 1978 recording a new career-high in tackles with 105 but only dropped opposing quarterbacks 3 times. During a November 4, 1979 game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, an infected boil on Sherk's arm was scraped off; a staph infection from the field's Astroturf entered his body through the wound and traveled to his knee. He was nearly killed by the infection.Toledo Blade article: \\"Knee Infection Puts Sherk Out of Action.\\" Sherk missed the last six games of the 1979 season. His substitute on the field was Henry Bradley. The injury eventually proved to be more problematic than first imagined, and effectively sidelined him for the 1980 season, in which he played in only one game and recorded only one tackle. He spent his final season, 1981, as a designated pass rusher, coming in to play defensive tackle when the Browns switched from a 3-4 defense to a four down lineman nickel defense. In that limited role he recorded 12 tackles and three sacks. In all, Sherk totaled 864 career tackles and 69¬Ω sacks. Along the way, blocked 6 kicks, intercepted three passes, and recovered ten fumbles.  Post NFL career  =Photography= After leaving football, Sherk worked as a sports photographer for roughly ten years. His work was featured in Sports Illustrated, Pro! Magazine, and many newspapers. His photographs from this time period were featured in an exhibition titled Through the Eyes of a Defensive Lineman: The Cleveland Browns as Photographed by Jerry Sherk.Cleveland Touchdown Club page: \\"The Cleveland Touchdown Club Charities Presents \\"Through The Eyes of a Defensive Lineman: The Cleveland Browns as Photographed by Jerry Sherk\\" .Jerry Sherk Photography: \\"Events.\\" The photo show was held December 14, 2010 at Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, and was sponsored by the Cleveland Touchdown Club Charities. =Mentoring= In 1991 Sherk returned to college, earning a master's degree in counseling psychology. He began counseling various vulnerable populations, becoming especially interested in working with at-risk children. Along the way he created a school-based group mentoring program that uses sports to teach young people how to reach goals in academics and life. Personal life Sherk resides in Encinitas, California in San Diego county, with his wife Ann.

(Proteaceae) is a 1981 monograph by Alex George on the taxonomy of the plant genus Banksia. Published by the Western Australian Herbarium as Nuytsia 3(3), it presented George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, the first major taxonomic revision of the genus since George Bentham published his arrangement in Flora Australiensis in 1870. One of the most important contributions of The Genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae) was the publication of ten new species and nine new varieties of Banksia. These were: *B. aculeata (Prickly Banksia) *B. chamaephyton (Fishbone Banksia) *B. conferta (Glasshouse Banksia) (and therefore also the autonym B. conferta var. conferta, now B. conferta subsp. conferta) *B. conferta var. penicillata (now B. conferta subsp. penicillata) *B. cuneata (Matchstick Banksia) *B. ericifolia var. macrantha (now B. ericifolia subsp. macrantha) *B. gardneri var. brevidentata *B. gardneri var. hiemalis *B. grossa (Coarse Banksia) *B. integrifolia var. aquilonia (now B. aquilonia) *B. lanata (Coomallo Banksia) *B. littoralis var. seminuda (now B. seminuda) *B. meisneri var. ascendens (now B. meisneri subsp. ascendens) *B. micrantha *B. nutans var. cernuella *B. plagiocarpa (Dallachy's Banksia) *B. saxicola (Grampians Banksia) *B. scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) *B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia *B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla *B. telmatiaea (Swamp Fox Banksia) In addition, B. sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens was redescribed as B. incana, and B. quercifolia var. integrifolia was redescribed as B. oreophila. B. collina was demoted to B. spinulosa var. collina, and B. cunninghamii was demoted to B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii. George further proposed a new infrageneric classification for Banksia, redefining some of the existing sections, demoting Bentham's B. sect. Cyrtostylis and B. sect. Orthostylis to B. ser. Cyrtostylis and B. ser. Orthostylis (now B. ser. Banksia) respectively, and publishing six new series: *B. ser. Coccinea (now B. sect. Coccinea) *B. ser. Grandes *B. ser. Tetragonae *B. ser. Spicigerae *B. ser. Prostratae *B. ser. Crocinae The classification was widely accepted, and is essentially the one that is in use today. Finally, having examined historical specimens at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and elsewhere, George published lectotypes for most pre-existing Banksia taxa.

He is currently serving a sentence of 82 years to life at Five Points Correctional Facility. Early life Bosket was born in Harlem. His father, Willie Sr. (Butch), killed two people in a Milwaukee pawn shop shortly after his son was conceived and was sentenced to life in prison, where he earned a degree in computer science and psychology. Butch was released from prison and went on to get a job as a computer programmer for an aerospace company but was charged with a crime. He shot his girlfriend and committed suicide to avoid being caught. Bosket had a traumatic childhood. When his grandfather was released from prison, he raped Willie many times. When he was 9 years old, his grandfather had him perform anal sex to \\"teach him about girls\\". His mother, Laura, had different live-in boyfriends who beat her and, as a boy, Bosket often jumped in to defend her, in one incident hitting a man with a pipe and slashing him with a knife and in another threatening \\"I'm going to burn that motherfucker up\\". He also suffered a head injury when he ran out into the street, and was hit by a car. This was all before he was ten years old. When he was nine years old, his mother, heeding advice, petitioned he be placed in a center, stating he was \\"a person in need of supervision\\". He was placed at The Children's Center in Manhattan, but escaped and quickly ended up at Spofford which was a \\"secure detention center\\" and a child's equivalent to an adult doing time in Attica State Prison. He would be in and out of detention centers and reformatories except for a short time when he turned 21 and had served out his time for murder. His mother had told him \\"Don't be bullied... Hit back. To get respect, you've got to be the toughest.\\" In the different centers, he developed a reputation for violence, upon which he prided himself. He told juvenile authorities that one day he would be a killer, just like his father.  Subway murders and fallout  On March 19, 1978, Bosket, then fifteen years old, shot and killed Noel Perez on a train operating on the New York City Subway's 3 train during an attempted robbery near the Harlem‚Äì148th Street terminal station. Eight days later, Bosket and another accomplice shot dead another man, Moises Perez (unrelated to his first victim) in another attempted robbery at the back of another 3 train at the 145th Street station, one station south of 148th Street. In between, Bosket and his accomplice shot a New York City Transit employee working in the Lenox Yard adjacent to the Harlem‚Äì148th Street station and committed two other armed robberies, one of them on the service.Dodge City, The Deadliest Precinct in Town, New York Magazine, August 28, 1978 Bosket was tried for the murders in New York City's family court. As the trial was underway, Bosket surprised his own lawyer by pleading guilty to both murders. He was sentenced to a maximum of five years in the Goshen Youth Facility. Although prosecutors tried to get a longer sentence, five years was the most they could get under the law, at the time. Significance The short length of Bosket's sentence caused a public outcry. Governor Hugh Carey had opposed efforts by his opponent in that year's gubernatorial election, State Assembly Minority Leader Perry Duryea, to have juveniles tried as adults for certain crimes. However, after reading a report on Bosket's sentence, Carey called the state legislature into special session to pass the Juvenile Offender Act of 1978. Under this act, children as young as thirteen years old could be tried in an adult court for crimes such as murder, and receive the same penalties as adults. New York was the first state to enact a law of this nature; all of the other states have since followed suit. Because it was Willie Bosket's case that was used to push laws allowing juveniles to be tried as adults, it is sometimes referred to as the Willie Bosket Law.  Subsequent crimes  A year after he began serving his sentence for the two murders, Bosket escaped from the youth facility. He was caught after two hours, tried as an adult for the escape and sentenced to four years in state prison. He was returned to the Division of Youth in 1979, and was released in 1983. After 100 days he was arrested when a man living in his apartment complex claimed Bosket had robbed and assaulted him. Then while awaiting trial on that crime, Bosket assaulted several court officers. He was found guilty of attempted assault for the dispute in the apartment and sentenced to seven years in prison. At this point, his escape from the youth facility nearly came back to haunt him. He was 16 years old at the time, meaning he was now considered an adult for criminal purposes. In New York, escaping from a correctional facility is a felony, even if the facility is a youth facility. If he had been convicted of assaulting the court officers, it would have been his third felony conviction. Under New York's habitual offender law, he was facing an automatic sentence of 25 years to life. However, he was acquitted. Convinced that he would die in prison, Bosket took out his rage on correction officers, getting into numerous altercations. Arrested for one of those incidents, he was convicted of assault and arson, and sentenced to 25 years to life. In 1989, he was sentenced to an additional 25-years-to-life sentence for stabbing corrections officer Earl Porter at the maximum-security Shawangunk Correctional Facility.Jailed 'Monster' Gets More Prison Time for Stabbing a Guard, The New York Times, April 20, 1989 After the 1988 assault, Bosket was transferred to Woodbourne Correctional Facility, where in April 1989 he drew a third 25-years-to-life sentence for assaulting a correction officer with a chain. All three sentences are consecutive. His earliest possible release date is September 16, 2062, when he will be 100 years old‚Äìall but assuring that he will die in prison. Since his conviction for the 1989 assault, Bosket (NYSDOCS inmate number 84A6391) has been housed in solitary confinement. While at Woodbourne, nominally a medium-security prison, Bosket was housed in a specially-built plexiglass-lined cell stripped of everything but a cot and a sink/toilet combination, with four video cameras watching him at all times. He was only allowed out of his cell for one hour a day, apart from medical visits and haircuts. Although he was allowed visitors, they could only speak to him through a window in his cell.Bosket profile at Crime Library Bosket once declared \\"war\\" on a prison system that he claimed made him a \\"monster,\\" and was cited for almost 250 disciplinary violations from 1985 to 1994. However, he has not had a disciplinary violation since 1994. According to a 2008 report in The New York Times, due to his numerous incidents of violence during the 1980s and 1990s, he was initially not slated to move into the general population until 2046, when he will be 84 years old. Department spokesman Erik Kriss told the Times, \\"This guy was violent or threatening violence every day. Granted, it has been a while, but there are consequences for being violent in prison. We have zero tolerance for that.\\" He has since been transferred to Five Points, a maximum-security prison. Although he is still in solitary confinement, he is evaluated periodically, and due to his clean disciplinary record in recent years may join the general population sooner than 2046. In 1995, New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield wrote All God's Children: The Bosket Family and the American Tradition of Violence (), an examination of the escalating violence and criminality in succeeding generations of the Bosket family where he described Willie Bosket's life as marred in violence and dysfunction from its beginning.

Knowing that their wish is very difficult to be fulfilled, Lord Brahma sent them to worship Lord Shiva on the banks of river Paalaru. Shiva, being pleased with their penance, appeared before them and told them that it is not possible for them to marry him as he is already married to Parvathi and advised them to marry Lord Ganapathy. Accordingly, they married Lord Ganapathy, who was returning after conquering the demon king Gajamukasuran.about Tiruvaleeswarar temple Thai Kirthigai Festivals Photo Gallery  File:Palani (Murugar Adimai).jpgPalani (Murugar Adimai) File:Murugar Ratham.jpgMurugar Ratham Main spots in Padi Lucas TVS, Wheels India, Sundaram Fasteners, Sundaram Clayton, Brakes India, and Britannia Industries are some of the industries in this area.

As the name of a dog variety, it is used in Russian cynological literature (not only in Russian, but sometimes in English as well) to refer to all varieties of hunting dogs traditionally kept by the peoples of the northern Russia and adjacent areas. This includes not only the three or four breeds known as Laikas in English, but also other standard breeds that the FCI classifies together with them as \\"Nordic Hunting Dogs\\" (Group 5, Section 2 of the FCI classification).FCI - Breed nomenclature. Group 5, Spitz and Primitive types Thus, the Norwegian Elkhound (FCI 242 and 268) is known in Russian literature as Norwegian Elk Laika (–Ω–æ—Ä–≤–µ–∂—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–æ—Å–∏–Ω–∞—è –ª–∞–π–∫–∞), and the Finnish Spitz (FCI 49) as Finnish Bird Laika (—Ñ–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ç–∏—á—å—è –ª–∞–π–∫–∞). In Russia the word laika is sometimes used less strictly, to refer not only to hunting dogs but also to the related sled dog breeds of the tundra belt, which the FCI classifies as \\"Nordic Sledge Dogs\\".

Her older sister Cha√Øne is also a Dutch international volleyball player. Their father Jean-Pierre played many international matches for the Belgium national volleyball team. Staelens speaks Dutch, English, French and German. Kim Staelens plays as a setter and is able to spike at 305 cm, while she is capable of blocking at 301 cm. International team career Born in Belgium both Staelens sisters were known to be talented players and decided to acquire for Dutch citizenship because they did not see enough future in the Belgian team. As their mother is Dutch both were welcomed in The Netherlands and became national team regulars shortly after. So far she has played 154 international matches for the Dutch team. Staelens was part of the Dutch squad for the 2006 World Championship where the placed 8th. She was also part of the team during the 2007 Boris Yeltsin Cup in Yekaterinburg where the Dutch won the silver medal after losing the final to China (3‚Äì1).

Before that she played mainly in the reserve teams in the Belgian First division. As being only 15 years old she was having a hard time keeping up with her team mates during her first season in The Netherlands at Bonduelle WC. She moved to VC weert and during her second season at the club in 1999 she captured her first two prizes, winning both the Dutch league and the cup. In 2000, she moved to France to play for Marcq en Baroeul, where she struggled to find her place in the team. She however decided to stay in France, but moved to another team. Also at USSPA Albi she was unable to become a key player and to get used to the French lifestyle. She then found her way to Germany where she signed a contract with USC Munster. In Munster things went better for herself which also resulted in better results. During her first season she did not capture any prizes but Munster finished in both the German league and cup in second position. One year later they showed their potential and were able to win both competitions. Staelens was at that time still part of the Munster team, however she did miss the crucial part of the season due to a knee injury. This knee injury prevented her from playing volleyball during the 2004 and 2005 seasons and she was recovering from her injury in a sports clinic in Zeist. For a long time it was unsure whether she was able to return to her top level. As soon as she was able to play in the later part of 2005 she was however immediately being called up for the national squad and participated in several tournaments.

Adherents of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith are persecuted in the Islamic Republic and are denied employment. On August 16, 1995, Mr. Mahrami was called before the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Yazd, and was questioned about his adherence to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. During the next few months the court met with Mr. Mahrami multiple times and tried to persuade him to renounce his beliefs. Upon his repeated refusal, Mr. Mahrami was charged with apostasy, and on January 2, 1996 was sentenced to death. His properties and assets were also confiscated. Although Mahrami was a lifelong Bah√° º√≠, the apostasy charge apparently came about because a sympathetic Muslim colleague, in an effort to prevent Mr. Mahrami from losing his job, stated that Mr. Mahrami had converted to Islam.

In March 2000, following an international outcry, Mr. Mahrami's sentence was commuted to life in prison.

He was the manager of Vancouver's Orpheum Theatre during its peak period from the 1930s to the 1960s. Early years Born and raised in Bristol, England, Ackery moved to Canada in 1914, arriving in Montreal and going from there to Vancouver. After serving in Europe with the Canadian Army during World War I, Ackery returned to Vancouver to further his education before moving in 1920 to Calgary, Alberta, beginning his long career in the entertainment industry as an usher at the Capitol Theatre, then the flagship of Famous Players' Calgary operations, in 1921. After returning to Vancouver in 1923, Ackery became an usher at that city's Capitol Theatre before his promotion to manager of the Victoria Theatre in south Vancouver in 1927. It was during his tenure there that Ackery began developing the promotional ideas that he would use in cinema management for the next four decades. Ackery was then promoted to manage the Dominion Theatre in downtown Vancouver in 1930, then was sent to Victoria to manage the Capitol Theatre there in 1932. While at the Victoria Capitol, Ackery introduced and promoted monthly midnight movies on Sundays, during a period when local bylaws prohibited Sunday movies, then persuaded Famous Players to allow him to play a Victoria-filmed feature at the Capitol called Crimson Paradise, which drew packed houses during its run thanks to heavy promotion by Ackery. Saturday afternoon children's matinees also were begun and became popular at the Capitol during Ackery's tenure. In 1934, Ackery returned to Vancouver when Famous Players promoted him to manage the Strand Theatre (located on the future site of Vancouver Centre in the downtown area), where he promoted live stage shows and popular British films. He was subsequently promoted to become the manager of the Orpheum in the summer of 1935. The Orpheum Theatre years (1935-1969) Faced with both the Great Depression and competition from other Famous Players theatres and locally owned independent cinemas, Ackery set out to present major-release feature films and live shows featuring popular acts of the day at the Orpheum. Under Ackery, the theatre, the largest movie house in Vancouver at the time, was frequently picked to show movie premieres in Canada, often world or Canadian premieres (such as 1939's Gone with the Wind, 1942's The Forest Rangers [in which one of that movie's stars, Susan Hayward, appeared in person for the world premiere at the Orpheum], and the 1965 James Clavell World War II feature King Rat). Live shows at the Orpheum during the Ackery years featured performing greats like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey, George Burns, Jack Benny and Chief Dan George. Ackery would win several promotional awards during his Orpheum years, most notably the Quigley Award (awarded by the Motion Picture Herald trade publication to movie promoters who were judged to have delivered outstanding movie promotion campaigns) in 1947 and 1952. Retirement and death Ackery, then aged 69, retired as manager of the Orpheum in 1969 after Famous Players introduced a new clause requiring mandatory retirement for its employees at age 65. Despite retirement, he carried on in public life in Vancouver, most notably spearheading the campaign to save the Orpheum when, in 1973, Famous Players announced plans to have the palatial cinema gutted and turned into a multiplex (a fate which would later befall the nearby Capitol, also FP-owned). Thanks to Ackery's efforts, which included contributions by Vancouver city council and other entities and several benefit concerts (including an engagement by Jack Benny), the city bought the Orpheum on March 19, 1974. The theatre showed its final movie, Return to Macon County, on November 23, 1975, then was renovated over the next year and reopened on April 2, 1977 as the new home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Ackery wrote his autobiography on his years with Famous Players and in theatre management and promotion, Fifty Years on Theatre Row, which was published in 1980. He died on October 29, 1989, in West Vancouver, British Columbia, one day shy of his 90th birthday.

It operates from New Norfolk. It is 3' 6\\" narrow gauge. History Tasmanian Government Railways opened the Derwent Valley Line in 1886.Stokes, H.J.W. (1975)The Derwent Valley Railway Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June, 1975 pp125-143 Initially, it ran from the junction at Bridgewater, on the main north-south Hobart to Devonport line, to New Norfolk, a distance of 18 kilometres. It was extended to 29 km at Plenty in 1887, and then to 41 km at Glenora in 1888. It closely follows the course of the River Derwent for the first 39 km as far as Coniston, and crosses the river at three different points. The following years saw a number of plans to extend the line further up the Derwent Valley or to connect it to the West Coast. Finally, twenty one years later, in 1909, it was extended along the Tyenna River, another 8 km to what is now Westerway. In 1917 another extension was added to extend the railway to Fitzgerald (66 km), and a final extension was opened in 1936 to Kallista, 74 km from Bridgewater. The last extension replaced an earlier wooden tramway on the same alignment. The primary usage of the line was to provide a service to the rural areas and the logging areas around Kallista. In 1940 there was a significant increase in log traffic along most of the line with the opening of a paper mill at Boyer, 14 km from Bridgewater. This increased traffic resulted in the construction of two deviations and additional facilities at a number of stations. Sometime later, parts of the railway began to close. Firstly, the logging branches around Kallista, and then the section from Kallista to Florentine Junction were closed. In 1995, TasRail completely closed the line beyond New Norfolk after floods and heavy rain substantially damaged the track. Restoration In 1990, Derwent Valley Railway Preservation Society was formed. It purchased the assets of the Tasmanian Locomotive Company, who had been operating excursion trains on the line. The Society established its operating base at New Norfolk, although initially operating out of the Hobart suburb of Claremont. It continued operating passenger trains on the line to Maydena. The Derwent Valley Line was closed beyond New Norfolk in 1995, and so the Society operated to other destinations. Although the line remained under Tasrail ownership, in 1999 the line was reopened by the society to Hayes, then in 2000 to Westerway and then to National Park in 2003 (37 km from New Norfolk). The society now trades as Derwent Valley Railway Inc. The Society now has 11 locomotives (4 steam, 4 diesel-electric, 1 diesel-hydraulic and 2 diesel-mechanical), 9 carriages, and 11 wagons. Two of Tasrail's freight services regularly used the section from Bridgewater to the Norske Skog paper mill at Boyer, carrying paper to Burnie for export, and the other supplying the plant with coal and timber from the north of the State. The present In October 2005, Pacific National, who had taken over commercial running of the TasRail network, closed the Derwent Valley Line west of New Norfolk. This effectively stopped the running of the heritage railway. In May 2006, Pacific National came to a new agreement with the Tasmanian Government which included returning all tracks and rail lands to Government ownership. Derwent Valley Railway Inc. are currently in negotiations to regain access to the Derwent Valley Line to restore it to its former glory and operate it as a world class tourist railway.

There are several \\"verbal possessive\\" forms based on verbs with the sense of \\"to possess\\" or \\"to have\\" or \\"to own\\". An alternative is the use of the particle no („ÅÆ) between two nouns or noun phrases.  Verbal possessives  =Shoyuusuru and motsu= Shoyuu (ÊâÄÊúâ) is a Japanese noun of Sino-Japanese origin. It translates as ‚Äòthe state of possession‚Äô or ‚Äòownership‚Äô. In Japanese, nouns, mainly those of Chinese origin, may attached themselves to the verb suru („Åô„Çã), ‚Äòto do‚Äô, to form a compound verb. The verb ‚Äòto come to possess/own‚Äô, shoyuusuru, is formed in this manner. Shoyuusuru is considered a formal term, used in reference to possessions with legal certification such as cars, in comparison to the native Japanese counterpart motsu (ÊåÅ„Å§), generally meaning ‚Äòto come to have/own/possess‚Äô. Both motsu and shoyuusuru require animate possessors and controllable alienable possessees. The possessee may be human/animate but must be controllable, for example, a possessee cannot be a father/mother and such.Tsujioka, 2002 p10 The possessor noun phrase is the subject, as indicated by the particle ga („Åå), and the possessee noun phrase is the object, which is indicated by the particle o („Çí). * „Ç∏„Éß„É≥„Åï„Çì„ÅåËªä„ÇíÊâÄÊúâ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã John- san ga kuruma wo shoyuushite iru: \\"John has a car\\" (lit. \\"John car possess be.\\"); * „Ç∏„Éß„É≥„Åï„Çì„ÅåÁä¨„ÇíÈ£º„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÔºàÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÔºâ John-san ga inu wo motte iru: \\"John has a dog\\" (lit. \\"John dog hold be.\\"). Japanese verbs do not recognise the difference between present and future form. There is no verbal conjugation which translates as ‚ÄòI will do this.‚Äô The ‚Äòplain‚Äô form of the verbs shoyuusuru and motsu cannot be used to express present states. In order to do this, as seen in (1) and (2), the verb must be changed into its ‚Äìte form and have the verb ‚Äòto be (animate)‚Äô ‚Äì iru („ÅÑ„Çã) attached. This form indicates a continuous state of being ‚Äì ‚ÄòI have, and I continue to have‚Ä¶‚Äô 3)ÊâÄÊúâ„Åô„Çã shoyuusuru ÊâÄÊúâ„Åó„Å¶ shoyuushi-te ÊâÄÊúâ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã shyoyuushi-te iru ‚Äòto have/possess/own‚Äô 4)ÊåÅ„Å§ motsu ÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶ mot-te ÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã mot-te iru 'to have/possess/own' The sentence structure to be used when using shyoyuusuru and motsu to describe possession is 5) NP1 ga NP2 o Verb-te iru Possessor Subject-marker Possessee Object-marker Verb-te iru =Iru and Aru= Iru („ÅÑ„Çã) and aru („ÅÇ„Çã) are the present/future ‚Äòplain‚Äô form of the verb translated as ‚Äòto be/exist‚Äô. Iru is always used in reference to an animate subject or object, and aru always refers to an object or subject that is inanimate; 6) jon-san/hon wa Osaka ni i-ru/ar-u John/book SUB Osaka NI be-PRES ‚ÄòJohn/The book is in Osaka.‚Äô When the verb is used following an object marked with ga and a subject marked with ni („Å´), the translation becomes ‚Äòto have‚Äô. For example, 7) jon-san ni kuruma ga ar-u John NI car OBJ have-PRES ‚ÄòJohn has a car‚Äô. To arrive at this translation, the particle ni is read, in this context, as ‚Äòin/at‚Äô, the place where something is at the present. So at first, the translation for (7) may be considered ‚Äòa car is at John/in John‚Äôs presence‚Äô. In order to reach the translation ‚Äòto have‚Äô, Tsujioka2002, p13 presents these two examples: 8)*heya ni otoko ga ar-u Room NI man OBJ be-PRES ‚ÄòThere is a man in the room.‚Äô 9) jon-san ni musuko ga ar-u John NI son OBJ be-PRES ‚ÄòJohn has a son‚Äô Sentence (8) is semantically incorrect, as aru is used in reference to an animate object. The use of musuko with aru, however, is allowed, as some kinship terms may use the ‚Äòanimacy-insensitive‚Äô form of aru.Tsujioka, 2002, p13 It can then be said that there are two translations of aru/iru ‚Äì ‚Äòto be‚Äô and ‚Äòto have‚Äô. Unlike shoyuusuru and motsu however, iru/aru can express relationship as well as ownership, as seen in (9) where John does not physically own his son. Rather, it is a statement expressing the relationship. Although iru/aru sentences may have a possessee that is alienable and inalienable, it is not possible to have a modified inalienable possessee; 10) *jon-san ni pinku no kami ga ar-u John NI pink GEN hair OBJ be-PRES ‚ÄòJohn has pink hair.‚Äô This appears to be the only restraint, other than the animate/inanimate restrictions, and its solution will be discussed in the next section. The sentence structure for iru/aru possessive sentences is 11) NP1 ni NP2 ga Verb. Possessor NI Possessee OBJ Verb =Suru= As mentioned, the iru/aru form of possessive sentences does not allow for modified possessees. There is however another verbal possessive which does allow for modified possessees, in fact the possessee must be modified and may only be inalienable. This is suru („Åô„Çã). The sentence structure for possessive suru sentences is the same as that of shyoyuusuru/motsu sentences: 12) NP1 ga NP2 o shi-te i-ru Possessor SUB Possessee OBJ do-PART be-PRES Suru translates as ‚Äòdo‚Äô, using the form seen in (12), shi-te iru, translates as ‚Äòdoing‚Äô. This is constructed in the same manner as shyoyuushi-te iru and mot-te iru; 13)suru shi-te shi-te iru ‚Äòis doing‚Äô As with the Shoyuu/motsu sentences, suru possessive sentences only express ownership and not relationships (as the possessee must be inalienable, as aforementioned): 14) jon-san ga pinku no kami o shi-te i-ru John SUBJ pink hair GEN OBJ do-PART be-PRES ‚ÄòJohn has pink hair.‚Äô =Zokusuru= The verb zokusuru ÔºàÂ±û„Åô„ÇãÔºâis translated as ‚Äòto belong to‚Äô or ‚Äòto be affiliated with‚Äô. The verb does not indicate belonging in the sense of ownership, but rather affiliation. For example, the following is incorrect 15) *kono hon wa jon-san ni zokushi-te i-ru This book SUB John NI belong-PART be-PRES ‚ÄòThis book belongs to John.‚Äô This sentence is grammatically incorrect. Zokusuru can only be used when describing affiliation, such as in (16): 16) jon-san wa ANU ni zokushi-te i-ru John SUB ANU NI belong-PART be-PRES ‚ÄòJohn belongs to/is affiliated with the ANU.‚Äô This verb is included in this list in order to describe the difference in translation meanings.  Expressing possession using particle no („ÅÆ)  =Possession and relationships= The particle no („ÅÆ) is used to express possession, either figuratively or literally, of one noun phrase by a second noun phrase, by indicating that the noun preceding no is the possessor, and the noun following is the possessee. Both the possessor and the possessee can be alienable or inalienable: (20)watashi no te ÁßÅ„ÅÆÊâã me NO hand 'My hand.' 21) jon no kuruma „Ç∏„Éß„É≥„ÅÆËªä John NO car 'John's car.' In this way, no may modify an unlimited number of nouns, for example 22) watashi no inu no beddo... ÁßÅ„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Å¨„ÅÆ„Éô„ÉÉ„Éâ me NO dog NO bed... 'My dog's bed...' In the same way, this noun-no-noun structure also indicates relationships between the possessor and uncontrollable possessees. For example, 23)watashi no okasan ÁßÅ„ÅÆ„ÅäÊØç„Åï„Çì me NO mother 'My mother.' 24) jon no ani „Ç∏„Éß„É≥„ÅÆÂÖÑ John NO big brother 'John's big brother' The possessee can be pronominalised by replacing it with either mono („ÇÇ„ÅÆ), which translates as ‚Äòone‚Äô, as in ‚ÄòJohn‚Äôs one‚Äô, or √ò (0 particle). Japanese often omits proper nouns and subjects once they have already been mentioned in a conversation, and which are then understood through context. In the following sentences, desu („Åß„Åô) the copula translates as ‚Äòis‚Äô, 25)kore wa jon no mono desu „Åì„Çå„ÅØ„Ç∏„Éß„É≥„ÅÆÁâ©„Åß„Åô this SUB John NO one COP ‚ÄòThis is John‚Äôs one.‚Äô 26) kore wa jon no √ò desu „Åì„Çå„ÅØ„Ç∏„Éß„É≥„ÅÆÔΩû„Åß„Åô this SUB John NO √ò COP ‚ÄòThis is John‚Äôs.‚Äô There is a slight difference in meaning between the two pronouns. As Hirakouji1979, pp137-138 states, mono-pronominalisation refers to the possessee as an objectively viewed object, while √ò-pronominalisation conveys the speaker's subjective attention to the object and inclusive contrast, and cannot appear in the ordinary focus position. Hirakouji presents the following examples (in (28), the first no is used to nominalise the preceding clause) to demonstrate how √ò-pronominalisation cannot be used in the ordinary focus position (27 is incorrect): 27)*kore wa merii no √ò desu ga, are wa jon √ò desu „Åì„Çå„ÅØ„É°„É™„Éº„ÅÆÔΩû„Åß„Åô„Åå„ÅÇ„Çå„ÅØ„Ç∏„Éß„É≥ÔΩû„Åß„Åô this SUB Mary NO √ò COP but, that SUB John √ò COP ‚ÄòThis is Mary‚Äôs, but that is John‚Äôs.‚Äô 28)watashi ga hoshii no wa merii no √ò desu me SUB want NOM OBJ Mary NO √ò COP ‚ÄòWhat I want is Mary‚Äôs.‚Äô The phrase structure when using no as a possessive particle is indicated in (29). The phrase constitutes a noun phrase. 29)([NOUN (possessor)] no [NOUN (possessee)]) Footnotes Bibliography (2001). Kodansha's furigana: English-Japanese dictionary. Kodansha Ltd.: Japan. (2001).

Killings The Ottoman prefect of Menemen, Kemal Bey, and the six gendarmes accompanying him were assassinated by Greek soldiers in the evening of the first day. These deaths became the opening act for further killings carried out on the civilian population of Menemen the following day by a Cretan brigade aided by a number of accomplices from the local Greek minority. The event was termed as a \\"massacre\\" by an inter-allied commission composed of four generals representing the Allied Powers. The commission also said that the massacre was not organized by the Greek Command, but was as a result of the panic and anger of the young troops who were still affected by the Pergamos (Bergama) events and whom their officers were not able to calm. At Pergamos, the Turkish irregulars who retook the city murdered the Turkish inhabitants who welcomed the Greeks and also massacred and tortured all the Greek soldiers who were prisoners. The number of casualties among the civilian Turkish population of the town during the single day of June 17 vary between two hundred, according to the October 1919 report drawn up by the Inter-Allied Commission; to one thousand, according to a delegation that arrived the next day (June 18, 1919). Captain Charns, the head of that delegation, contrasted the number of Turkish victims against the non-existence of any Greek wounded, either civilian or military. The October report, prepared by the British officers and medical delegates from the British and Italian consulates in Smyrna, rejected the 1000 casualties figure as an exaggeration, finding that at least 100 had died, and mentioning a French officer's investigation the day after the massacre reporting that 200 Turks had been killed, and 200 injured.Report of the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry (May-September 1919) by the Members of the Commission; Adm. Bristol, the US Delegate - Gen. Hare, the British Delegate - Gen. Bunoust, the French Delegate - Gen. Dall'Olio, the Italian Delegate. The statements in defense of the Greek government presented by Col. Mazarakis. The events were protested by the Ottoman Sheikhulislam. The Greek military claimed that they were attacked in the town, but the commission did not give credit to their statements. They found the Greeks alone responsible for the bloodshed. Demographer Justin McCarthy, rejecting the findings of the Inter-Allied Commission, claimed the massacre was preplanned, indicated by the fact that before the attacks all Greek houses in the city had been marked with white crosses and were not affected by the pillage and destruction.Justin McCarthy, Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922, Darwin Press, 1996, p. 270 .

Career Her first fitness competition was the NPC South Carolina State in 1995, where she placed first. She would eventually end up winning eight fitness competitions. Her background and presence in fitness contests made her a familiar face at fitness expositions as well as in fitness magazines. Ryan placed second for three years (until 2004) in the Fitness Olympia. Personal life She was married to bodybuilder Craig Titus. In prison she filed for divorce, which became final in December 2009. =Involvement in the murder of Melissa James= On December 14, 2005 the burnt corpse of Melissa James, a woman who was in a sexual relationship with Titus and lived in Ryan and Titus' home, was discovered inside a Jaguar car belonging to Kelly Ryan. The couple went into hiding together and were arrested along with suspected accomplice, Anthony Gross, after a nine-day investigation. A Nevada prosecutor alleged in open court that Titus was part of a plot to murder three witnesses due to testify in the case. No charges were filed and Titus‚Äô defense lawyer said he didn't think that there was enough evidence for charges in the allegation. While awaiting trial, in April 2006, Ryan‚Äôs mother died of a heart attack said to have been precipitated by stress. The trial of co-defendant Anthony Gross on arson and accessory to murder charges was separated from the murder trial for Titus and Ryan. On May 31, 2008, rather than going through a trial, Ryan and Titus pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Ryan plead guilty to one count of arson, entering an Alford plea to one count of battery with a deadly weapon resulting in significant bodily harm. She was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 3‚Äì13 years in prison. On December 23, 2011, the Nevada Parole Board granted Ryan parole on the assault charges. She remained incarcerated to begin serving time for the arson charge. On September 2, 2014, Ryan was denied parole on the second charge .

After England took control of the colony in 1664, its colonists continued the importation of slaves from Africa. They also imported \\"seasoned\\" slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas. Most Dutch and English immigrants entered the colony as indentured servants, who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage. As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined, New Jersey's colonists trafficked more Africans for needed labor. To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony, the colonial government awarded settlers headrights of of land for each person transported to the colony. In 1704, after East Jersey and West Jersey unified, the Province of New Jersey passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free blacks from owning property, further restricting African Americans in the state. During the American Revolution, enslaved African Americans fought on each side. The British Crown promised freedom to slaves who would leave their rebel masters and fight for the British. The number of blacks in Manhattan increased to 10,000, as thousands of slaves escaped to the British for the promise of freedom. The British refused to return former slaves to the Americans and they evacuated many Black Loyalists together with their troops and other Loyalists; they resettled more than 3,000 freedmen in their colony of Nova Scotia. Others were transported to England and the West Indies. Bergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state,\\"Bergen County Slavery\\" , Bergen County, accessed 13 July 2012 in part because many slaves were used as laborers in its ports and cities. At its peak Bergen County had 3,000 slaves in 1800, constituting nearly 20% of its total population.Secret History of a Northern Slave State Retrieved March 28, 2020 After the Revolutionary War, many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery, but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804, and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York. But, in New Jersey, some slaves were held as late as 1865. (In New York, they were all freed by 1827.) The law made African Americans free at birth, but it required children (born to slave mothers), to serve lengthy apprenticeships as a type of indentured servant until early adulthood for the masters of their slave mothers. New Jersey was the last of the Northern states to abolish slavery completely. The last 16 slaves in New Jersey were freed in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment.\\"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\\", PBS Newshour, 25 January 2007, accessed 11 February 2012 The Underground Railroad had several routes crossing the state, four of which ended in Jersey City, where fugitive slaves could cross the Hudson River. New Brunswick, 'Hub City', was a main location where runaways would travel during the days of the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, African Americans served in several all-black Union Army regiments from New Jersey. In 2008, the legislature of New Jersey passed a resolution of official apology for slavery, becoming the third state to do so. Rutgers, the State University moved to rectify its past wrongs and connections to slavery during its 250th anniversary celebration in 2016. Princeton University, the oldest college in the state of New Jersey, released the findings of its Princeton & Slavery Project in 2017. Colonial period The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the trafficking of eleven black slaves to New Amsterdam, capital of the nascent province of New Netherland. They worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders. It later expanded across the North River (Hudson River) to Pavonia and Communipaw, eventually becoming Bergen, where slaves worked the company plantation. Settlers to the area later held slaves privately, often using them as domestic servants and laborers. Although enslaved, the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact. They were admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, who also baptized their children. While enslaved Africans could be admitted to the Church, the church itself did not prohibit their enslavement. In fact, the Church did not even find that enslavement sinful. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours, when they earned wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell, the company freed all its slaves, establishing early on a nucleus of free negros. English traders continued to traffic African slaves after they took over the colony from the Dutch in 1664 and established a proprietorship. Eager to attract more settlers and laborers to develop the colony, the proprietorship encouraged the trafficking of slaves for labor by offering settlers headrights, an award of allocations of land based on the number of workers, slaves or indentured servants, trafficked to the colony. The first African slaves to appear in English records were owned by Colonel Lewis Morris in Shrewsbury. In an early attempt to encourage European settlement, the New Jersey legislature enacted a prohibitive tariff against trafficked slaves to encourage European indentured servitude. When this act expired in 1721, however, the British Government and New Jersey's royal governor, countered attempts to renew it. The slave trade was a royal monopoly and had become a lucrative enterprise. The liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704, a so-called 'slave code'. This code prohibited the owning of property by slaves and by free African Americans as well. In addition, it made certain actions illegal for African Americans, like staying out past curfew, that were not illegal for European Americans. Camden was a center for the importation of slaves, its ferry docks on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia acting as auction sites for the plantations in the Delaware Valley, of which Pomona Hall was one. In 2016 Rutgers University published a report Scarlet and Black recording the university's relationship with slavery. In 2017 Princeton University made public the findings of the Princeton & Slavery Project, which is ongoing. Post-American Revolution African-American slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence. The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause. The number of blacks in New York rose to 10,000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city. The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of freedmen from New York, resettling 3,500 Black Loyalists in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands.Nancy Shakir, \\"Slavery in New Jersey\\" , Slavery in America, Accessed 24 January 2007 Colonel Tye, also known as Titus Cornelius (c. 1753‚Äì1780),\\"Colonel Tye\\", Africans in America, PBSJonathan D.

Following the Revolutionary War in the 1780s, New Jersey initially resisted the urge to free slaves due to a desire to re-build their devastated economy. According to the American historian Giles Wright, by 1790 New Jersey's enslaved population numbered approximately 14,000. They were virtually all of African descent.Lawrence Aaron, \\"Confronting New Jersey's slave past\\", Bergen Record, 10 February 2006. Accessed 24 January 2007.

Accessed 28 December 2007 In the decades before the Revolution, slaves were numerous near Perth Amboy, the primary point of entry for New Jersey, and in the eastern counties. Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor, but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities. Abolition of slavery Following the Revolutionary War, New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788, but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state.Slavery in the North, Accessed 28 December 2007 In the first two decades after the war many northern states made moves towards abolishing slavery, and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves. Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas. Since slaves were widely used in agriculture, as well as the ports, the New Jersey state legislature was the last in the North to abolish slavery, passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition.\\"An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery\\" (15 February 1804), electronically transcribed text of act of the New Jersey State Legislature published by the New Jersey Digital Legal Library (hosted by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey). Accessed 24 January 2007. The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed. African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4, 1804 had to serve lengthy apprenticeships to the owners of their mothers. Women were freed at 21, but men were not emancipated until the age of 25.Douglas Harper, \\"Slavery in New Jersey\\", Slavery in the North website, 2003, accessed 13 July 2012 Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered, after 1846, as indentured servants who were \\"apprenticed for life.\\"\\"An Act to Abolish Slavery\\" (18 April 1846), electronically transcribed text of act of the New Jersey State Legislature published by the New Jersey Digital Legal Library (hosted by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey).Accessed 21 February 2012. Although at first New Jersey allowed free people of color to vote, the legislature disfranchised them in 1807, an exclusion that lasted until 1875. By 1830 two-thirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey, as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition. It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery, but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were \\"apprenticed for life\\" to their masters. Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the American Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. According to historian James Gigantino (University of Arkansas), during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey, there were more female than male slaves. After the passage of the Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804, a greater number of advertisements in the state for the full-title sale of female slaves of child-bearing age were published. Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term, even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. However, domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves. By 1830, African Americans made up 6% of the total population of New Jersey. The city of New Brunswick had a large African American population at an around 11%. This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways, but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters, who wished to enforce the federal fugitive slave laws of 1850. In more urban areas of the state, like New Brunswick, there were frequent advertisements for the sale of female slaves, both before and after passage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work, which was in greater demand in urban spaces like New Brunswick. Enslaved women, however, also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey. Yet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom. Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age. By the 1830s, slavery was on the decline in New Jersey. Communities of free negros and freedmen formed at Dunkerhook in Paramus and at the New York state line at Skunk Hollow, also called The Mountain. A founding African-American settler bought land there in 1806, and later bought more. Other families joined him, and the community continued into the twentieth century.Kathleen Sykes, \\"Skunk Hollow: History of a 19th Century Community of Free African-Americans\\", The Palisades Newsletter (NY), Mar 2006 - Issue 192 According to the historian David S. Cohen in The Ramapo Mountain People (1974), free people of color migrated from Manhattan into other parts of the frontier of northeastern New Jersey, where some intermarried and became ancestors of the Ramapo Mountain Indians.Cohen, David Steven (1974), The Ramapo Mountain People, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, pp. 74, 197, (Cohen's findings have been disputed by some scholars, including Albert J. Catalano.) According to Gigantino, one in ten slaves in New Jersey remained enslaved for life. Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders, and displayed antipathy toward abolition. He stated that about one quarter of New Jersey's African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s. Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did. The Civil War A total of 2,909 United States Colored Troops from New Jersey served in the Union Army. Because of the state's long-term apprenticeship requirements, at the close of the American Civil War, some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage. It was not until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed.According to Snell, James P. History of Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey, With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers. (Philadelphia: Everts & Peck, 1881). No ISBN (Pre-1964). Note: Several families in northwestern New Jersey (Sussex County) had slaves who, while legally \\"freed\\" by their owners, refused to leave their former masters. In the 1860 census, free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25,318, about 4% of the state's population of 672,035. By 1870 the number had increased to 30,658, but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration. Overall, New Jersey's population had increased to 906,096, with nearly 200,000 European immigrants.Historical Census Browser, 1860 and 1870 censuses . Accessed 28 Oct 2007 New Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the 13th Amendment, which it did in January 1866. Some of its industries, such as shoes and clothing, had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves, which was probably a factor.New Jersey ratified the 13th Amendment on 23 January 1866, after having rejected the amendment on 16 March 1865. , published by the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site Interpretive Staff, National Park Service (no further authorship information available). Accessed 24 January 2007 On March 31, 1870 Thomas Mundy Peterson (1824‚Äì1904) became the first African American to vote in an election under the just-enacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1875, \\"Jack\\" Jackson, described in a newspaper as \\"the last slave in New Jersey,\\" died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm at Secaucus. Abel Smith had manumitted his slaves in 1820, but Jackson \\"refused to accept his liberty\\" and remained on the family estate until his death. By the will of the late Abel Smith, Jackson was interred in the family burial ground. Apology In 2008, the New Jersey Legislature acknowledged the state's role in the history of slavery in the United States. In 2019, the Black Caucus of the Legislation initiated efforts to research the role slavery played in the state.

Biography He was the brother of Landulf, subdeacon of Milan. They were of the Cotta, a family of valvassores and vassals of the archdiocese. In his early career, Erlembald was referred to as a \\"captain.\\" In 1063, he returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and intended to become a monk when the deacon Ariald convinced him to take his brother's place at the head of the pataria. Erlembald, however, was not a cleric, but a soldier. In 1064, he travelled to Rome to confer with Pope Alexander II and confirm his support. On his return to Milan, he revealed the change in the character of the pataria by living in a palace near the church of Saint Victor and the Forty Martyrs. With papal permission he began imposing his will by force on the clergy, by deposing abbots and proceeding against the bishop, Guido da Velate. Guido was first accused of taking false oaths for not acting against simony in his province. Guido, however, organised a resistance to the patarini. Because of this, Ariald imposed the interdict on the city during the feast of the Ascension. The populace turned against him and he fled to Pavia. After being captured en route to Rome, Ariald was executed and his body thrown in Lake Maggiore. On 3 May 1067, Erlembald recovered his body and reburied it in S. Celso in Milan on 17 May. Ariald's popularity was also recovered after the lifting of the interdict. A papal legation lent Erlembald much needed moral support at a congregation at Vallambrosa. In 1069, Guido renounced the see to Gotofredo da Castiglione with the support of the Emperor Henry IV. Gotofredo was immediately besieged in his castle. On 7 March 1070, violence broke out again in Milan and Gotofredo was arrested. That year, Guido request his archbishopric back from Erlembald. He was refused, but the patarino leader put him in S. Celso and then in the see of Bergoglio. On 6 January 1072, Erlembald appointed Atto archbishop in opposition to the arrested Gotofredo. Strong opposition from the German court evaporated suddenly in 1073 when Henry was troubled by revolts in Saxony and had to ceded his rights in Milan to Pope Gregory VII. Gregory confirmed Atto and lent his support to Erlembald. At this, the height of his power, an unfortunate fire broke out in the city and was interpreted as divine punishment for supporting the controversial pataria. The opposition factions in Milan signed a pact against Erlembald. He put down the revolt, but was killed in the battle and buried in S. Celso. From 6 to 26 May in 1095, Pope Urban II was present at Milan for the transferral of the relics of the canonised Erlembald to S. Dionigi. He was already a propaganda tool at the time of the preaching of the First Crusade. He was translated once more in 1528 to the Duomo. His feast day is 27 July. See also Sources *Caravale, Mario (ed).

The show, previously known as The Manila International Motor Show, is an annual venue for car buyers and enthusiasts alike to take a closer look at the latest models and significant concepts from the Philippines‚Äô premiere auto makers. History of the Manila International Auto Show In South East Asia, the Philippines is one of the seats of automotive history. In the years after World War II, the Philippines became an attractive venue for foreign investment. Japanese companies seeking to expand their market penetration established factories in this country. There were notable early successes: In 1955, Mercedes-Benz established an assembly plant in the Philippines that was the first in the world outside of Germany, to produce its E-Class sedan. In 1972, GM established a jointly owned vehicle and transmission manufacturing operation in the Philippines with two Philippine companies. In 1979, Isuzu Motors invests in the venture, GM Pilipinas, Inc. During the Martial Law regime of Ferdinand Marcos, foreign investment dried up, and most car companies shuttered their operations in the country. Stalwarts such as Toyota and Ford stopped producing and selling cars. GM Pilipinas‚Äô assembly and transmission plants ceased operation in 1985. With the restoration of a credible government, and establishment of freer trade policies, the Philippines was again back on the map. Soon, carmakers were establishing new facilities in the region, and the Philippines attracted it share of investment. In a land once called the Pearl of the Orient, where ‚ÄúJeepneys‚Äù and ‚ÄúCalesas‚Äù were once the king of the road, Manila is now positioning to be an automotive force to reckon with. With production figures inching closely to pre-Asian crisis volumes, the automotive industry appears to be shifting to a higher gear. The clamour for growth and the need for the automotive brands to be showcased in a forum for new model debuts became the impetus to stage the first ever Manila International Motor Show. For this very reason, motoring writers Jason K. Ang, Ulysses K. Ang, and Alvin Uy approached Joseph Ang, Chairman of Worldbex Services International and talked about the idea of holding an international grade and industry-based auto show.

It is located within the Portland metropolitan area. The area sits between Beaverton and Hillsboro, and is generally considered to be south of U.S. 26, north of Walker Road, west of 158th, and east of Cornelius Pass Road. The area has many shopping areas and is the former home of the defunct Tanasbourne Mall. History In the 1970s, Standard Insurance Company developed a large tract of land along the Sunset Highway near 185th Avenue. The name of the development is a hybrid of the Middle English term bourn and tenas from the Chinook Jargon. The latter term translates as small and the former as creek, giving the term tanasbourne the meaning of small, pretty creeks. Standard developed an indoor mall at the site, with the mall opening in 1975. In 1976, a library was opened in the community, and in 1990 the city of Hillsboro took over those operations and maintained the branch until 2007, when it was closed and a new main branch of the Hillsboro Public Library was opened farther west.Hillsboro Libraries In 1983, the county approved a master plan created by Standard to develop at Tanasbourne. Hillsboro annexed much of the Tanasbourne area in 1987. The next year plans were announced for an expansion of the old mall along with construction of new retail buildings in the area. The mall was never expanded. The Streets of Tanasbourne shopping complex Hillsboro started working to designate the area as a town center within Metro's planning framework in 1996.

It is similar to an Americano, but with a stronger aroma and taste. A long black is made by pouring a double-shot of espresso or ristretto over hot water. Typically about 100 - 120 milliliters of water is used (3.5 - 4 ounces) but the measurement is considered to be flexible to individual taste. The smaller volume of water compared to an Americano is responsible for its stronger taste. Usually the water is also heated by the espresso machine.

However, he is best known as the only umpire to be banned from baseball. Biography He was born on July 24, 1851 in Ipswich, England. Higham's family immigrated to the United States when he was two years old, and they settled in Hoboken, New Jersey. During his career he was a very versatile player, fielding multiples positions, mainly as a right fielder and catcher with notable playing time as a second baseman as well. In , he joined the New York Mutuals of the National Association during its inaugural season and played until the league was dissolved after the 1875 season, serving as player-manager in 1874. He then moved on to the newly formed National League, baseball's first recognized major league, where he hit in the first NL triple play against the Mutuals on May 13, . In , he served as captain of the Syracuse Stars in the inaugural year of the International League, which was part of the League Alliance, with whom the National League had a working relationship. After his playing days were over, he served as an umpire for two years (though rumors abounded that he was fixing games as a player). However, in , William G. Thompson, owner of the Detroit Wolverines (and also mayor of Detroit) got suspicious about some of the calls Higham made against his team. He hired a private detective, who turned up several letters between Higham and a well-known gambler. Higham outlined a simple code‚Äîif the gambler received a telegram from him saying \\"Buy all the lumber you can\\", the gambler was to bet on Detroit. No telegram meant that the gambler was to bet on his opponent. As a result of this evidence, Higham was fired as an umpire and banned from baseball. To date, he is the only umpire to have been banished from the game. He moved back to Chicago, Illinois and became a bookkeeper. It was here where he died and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery.

It lies in the Sz√©kely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. It is composed of a single village, S√¢ndominic. Demographics At the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 6,110; out of them, 97% were Hungarian, 1.4% were Roma and 0.4% were Romanian.Tab8.

Popula≈£ia stabilƒÉ dupƒÉ religie ‚Äì jude≈£e, municipii, ora≈üe, comune, 2011 census results, Institutul Na»õional de StatisticƒÉ, accessed 20 February 2020. The name S√¢ndominic is used for most official purposes, but the population usually uses the shortened form Domokos. Location S√¢ndominic is located in the upper reaches of the Olt valley, 29 kilometres north of Miercurea Ciuc. The mountain pass to the northwest, leading to the village of Izvorul Mure»ôului () and on to the large town of Gheorgheni, marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of Felcs√≠k. The northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre. Within the village limits, the Lok and Sz√°dak√∫t brooks meet the river, which then flows south to the village of Tome≈üti. In 1967, the northern village of BƒÉlan, long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village, gained official town status and was separated from S√¢ndominic; however, the two settlements still share important economic and transport links. The village is served by the Izvorul Olt station of Romanian State Railways, on the RƒÉzboieni-T√¢rgu Mure»ô-Deda-Miercurea Ciuc- Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe-Bra»ôov line. History There is evidence of Sz√©kely settlement on the site of S√¢ndominic in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, the village was the site of iron and copper mining (a tradition carried on until very recently in BƒÉlan.) The name Zent Damokos appears in a document from 1567.Transylvanian Toponym Book The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of P√°sztorb√ºkk. On this day, Sz√©kely irregulars, allied in the Long War with Michael the Brave () against the Hungarian nobility, killed the Cardinal Andr√°s B√°thory, Prince of Transylvania, who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the Battle of »òelimbƒÉr. The murderers were Mih√°ly Andr√°s Krist√°ly and Bal√°zs Nagy (later nicknamed Bal√°zs √ñrd√∂g - 'Bal√°zs the Devil') and they were executed for their deed. Pope Clement VIII responded by placing the whole village under interdict. A Memorial Cross was erected in 1816. Its location is at a distance of 5.5 km north of town, on south-eastern slope of the hill Fagul Ciobanului (1108 m) The village administratively belonged to Cs√≠ksz√©k, then, from 1876 until 1918 to the Cs√≠k County of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, S√¢ndominic, like the rest of Transylvania, formally passed with the Treaty of Trianon from Hungarian to Romanian control. The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere (also known as the Second Vienna Award). In 1944, the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control; a small monument in the village's central square bears witness to the 14 victims, among them an 86-year-old woman. After World War II, it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, it formed part of the Hungarian Autonomous Province, then, of the Mure»ô- Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968. Since then, the commune is part of Harghita County. Religious sites and buildings St. Dominic Roman Catholic church S√¢ndominic's Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802, and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages. A Greek Catholic church was completed in 1787, and there is also a small Romanian Orthodox church. Numerous chapels are scattered around the village, including the chapel at P√°sztorb√ºkk. A small village museum, containing historic farm equipment, costumes and weaponry, has been installed in the upper floor of the former House of Culture. The lower floor retains its function as a meeting-hall and often hosts musical and theatrical events. Examples of the famous \\"Sz√©kely gates,\\" richly carved wooden gates often several metres in height, can be seen throughout the village. For this and other reasons, S√¢ndominic has long attracted the attention of ethnologists and anthropologists.

N H Buchanan Motor Co Pty Ltd was an Australian kit car manufacturer. It made sports cars in the 1950s. The original body produced by Buchanan was a fibreglass item based on an Aston Martin DB3-S racing car. Buchanan borrowed a DB3-S and pulled moulds from it while it was in Australia. The styling was altered by filling in the scallops either side of the bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval. Because the target market was for rebodying of early model MGs, the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches, adding several centimetres to the body length. Racing car kits were also produced, consisting of this type of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections. The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ, with the front suspension crossmember and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body. The Buchanan Cobra was introduced in 1958 as a production vehicle based on Standard 10 mechanicals. Only 7 were manufactured.

MTSL is bifunctional, consisting of the nitroxide and the thiosulfonate ester functional groups. The nitroxide label is sterically protected, so it is relatively unreactive. Labeling MTSL is attached to proteins by reaction with thiol groups. The reaction exploits standard reactivity of thiosulfate esters. Sulfinic acid (CH3SO2H) is the leaving group: :RSO2S-nitroxide + protein-SH ‚Üí protein-S-S-nitroxide + RSO2H The heterodisulfide bond to the cysteine residue is robust, enabling site-directed spin labelling.Kenyon, G.L. and Bruice, T.W.

The MTSL moiety will add 184.3 daltons to the mass of the protein or peptide to which it is attached. The cysteine can be introduced using site-directed mutagenesis, and hence most positions in a protein can be labelled. Spectroscopy In Nuclear magnetic resonance the introduction of the paramagnetic group increases the relaxation rate of nearby nuclei. Its presence can be detected as peak broadening and loss of intensity in peaks corresponding to nearby nuclei. Hence proximity can be inferred for all nuclei, that are affected. A major advantage of this method over traditional methods for obtaining distance restraints in protein NMR is the increased length, as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement can detect distances up to 25 √Ö (2.5 nm) as opposed to about 6 √Ö (0.6 nm) using the nuclear Overhauser effect. Spin labelling with MTSL is frequently used in investigation of residual structure in intrinsically unstructured proteins.

This country is set in Central America, and was created by Australian comedic writers Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch (of The D-Generation and The Panel fame). Along with the other Jetlag Travel volumes, 2003's Molvan√Æa and 2004's Phaic TƒÉn, the book parodies both the language of heritage tourism and the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. In Spanish, San Sombr√®ro would be translated into English as \\"Saint Hat\\", \\"San\\" being the shortened word for the Spanish word \\"santo\\" meaning saint, and \\"sombrero\\" (no accent mark in real-world Spanish) meaning hat. According to the book the \\"full and technically correct\\" name of San Sombr√®ro is the \\"Democratic Free People's United Republic of San Sombr√®ro\\", and citizens may be arrested, without a warrant, if the title is not used.  About San Sombr√®ro  The \\"Democratic Free People‚Äôs United Republic of San Sombr√®ro\\" is a composite of many stereotypes and clich√©s about Central America and South America. It would be difficult to position the fictional San Somb√®ro on a map of Central America. Although it is presented as a thin country between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (similar to Panama), it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest, in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast, or west to east. If San Sombr√®ro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and Costa Rica. The book says the nation has \\"362 separate public holidays (not including the 'carnivale' long weekend)\\". San Sombr√®ro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable banana republic with seemingly endless revolutions and counter-revolutions. The country is said to have had 17 different presidents over 10 years. San Sombr√®ro is described as having a very high literacy rate because of an anti- illiteracy campaign in which \\"over 53,000 citizens who were unable to read [were] jailed or deported to Haiti\\". Before the arrival of the Spanish, San Sombr√®ro was said to inhabited by several \\"Amer-Indian\\" ethnic groups, called the \\"Ciboney\\" (Siboney) (Nomadic hunter-gatherers), \\"Taino\\" (who lived on seafood), \\"Puorcina\\" (who practiced simple agriculture) and the most dominant \\"Guanajaxo\\" (they just stole from everyone else). But there was a tribe that existed before called the \\"Bollivquar\\", fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society, which is said to be odd because they \\"never quite\\" mastered fire, irrigation or star jumps. But they learnt how to farm tobacco, which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet, explaining their stunted growth. Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking. = Language = San Sombr√®ro is a Spanish-speaking country, but a dialect has developed known as San Sombr√®ran, which combines Castilian grammar, Portuguese pronunciation, and indigenous shouting. San Sombr√®ran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish, because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence (particularly since their breath is so foul). San Sombr√®ran Spanish has many English loanwords, some of which are \\"beisbol\\" - baseball, \\"hamburgesa\\" - hamburger (these two are actual Spanish words), \\"beeras\\" - beers, and \\"dryvebyshooting\\" - drive by shooting. = National anthem = The San Sombr√®ran national anthem is \\"O Patria Gloriosa\\" (O Glorious Motherland), written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro, who is famous for uttering \\"He who loves his country, lives forever\\" shortly before falling off a ladder and dying. The national anthem is set to a bossa nova beat, and loyal citizens of San Sombr√®ro will stand respectfully, place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played. *A verse :: My baby melts my heart :: My baby drives me nuts :: The way she swings her hips :: The way her hair hangs down :: Give me a kiss, :: O gorgeous woman :: Cover my lips :: In passionate bliss :: Long live San Sombr√®ro :: O glorious fatherland. = Flag = Flag of San Sombrero The flag of San Sombr√®ro is the \\"Camouflagio\\", which resembles military camouflage, with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side. When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered tablecloth made an impromptu flag. = Regions = The capital city of San Sombr√®ro is Cucaracha City in Pollu√ßi√≥n. There are five provinces in San Sombr√®ro including Pollu√ßi√≥n, the other provinces are: *Maracca (Capital: San Pistachio) *Guacomala (Capital: Fumarole) *Lambarda (Capital: Aguazura) *San Abandonio (Capital: Nicoti√±o)  Fictional travel guides  The book advertises (fictional) guides on the following places: Unaudited Arab Emirates (the Middle East), Costa Lottsa (akin to Monaco), the Barbituros Islands (the Caribbean), Alpenstein (the Alps), Tyranistan (Former Soviet Union), Nuku'la Atoll (Polynesia), frozen Norgborg (Scandinavia), and the miserable Isle of Fogg (North Sea). It also advertises its website's forum, as well as world tours for botanists and golfers, and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe. The book ends with The Jetlag Story.

During his time in GIF Sundsvall he helped the club up to Allsvenskan in 1999. Nilsson's playing in Sundsvall had again attracted attention, this time from Allsvenska AIK, who made a deal with GIF Sundsvall that Per Nilsson would move to the club prior to the 2002 season in 2001, however due to a series of different circumstances, as several key players left AIK, made AIK change the deal so that he could join the club already in the autumn of 2001. Following his debut against IFK Norrk√∂ping he quickly established himself as a regular central defender, however a series of manager changes and other events made Per feel that he could not perform at top level. =Europe= Following AIK's poor performance during the 2004 season saw the club relegated from Allsvenskan and Per Nilsson leave the club for Norwegian club Odd Grenland for approximately 3 million Norwegian kroner. Odd Grenland rejected a ¬£1 million offer from English side Sunderland AFC in August 2006. It was widely expected that he would leave for a bigger club, however no bids came until 13 July 2007 when it was announced that Nilsson signed a contract with 2. Bundesliga team 1899 Hoffenheim.

Famous for his rebellious, sword fighting roles in many jidaigeki silent films, he rose to fame after joining the T≈çjiin Studio of Makino Film Productions in Kyoto in 1923. Life =Early life= Bantsuma, birth name Denkichi Tamura, was born in Kodenmach≈ç, Nihonbashi, Tokyo. Bantsuma's father, a cotton wholesaler named Ch≈çgor≈ç, lived till the age of 71 but his mother, older brother, and sister died when he was young. He attended Jisshi Elementary School (which stands next to the former site of Denma-ch≈ç Prison where many the loyal supporters of the Emperor, whom he frequently played in his films, were deeply involved). At school, he was often the leader of the pack and was actively involved in plays. While performing in a school play, Bantsuma froze on stage, unable to recite his lines. Embarrassed, he ran off and stayed in his room, weeping for 10 days. It is said that during this time, he vowed to become someone who would be admired by all. After the death of his mother, his father's business soon went bankrupt and Bantsuma was unable to continue his education. After finishing elementary school, he became an apprentice and pupil to Kataoka Nizaemon, a famous kabuki actor. However, in the world of kabuki, lineage was extremely important and Bantsuma struggled to gain fame. He soon changed his artistic direction by joining small theaters and taking small roles at Kokkatsu production firm. In 1922, with Kichimatsu Nakamura, he formed the ‚ÄúBando Tsumasaburo Troupe,‚Äù but it was disbanded very quickly. In 1923, Bantsuma and Kichimatsu were scouted into the film industry by Makino Film Studio. =Early Film Career= Once he joined Makino Film Productions, he began to build a celebrated career as an actor. It was during this period that he became best friends with Rokuhei Susukita, a script writer who wrote almost a hundred scripts for the Makino studio. He introduced complex plot lines, exhilarating action sequences, and unruly anarchy to jidaigeki films, very much in the style of American films. Rokuhei subsequently selected Bantsuma to debut in his film Gyakuryo in 1924, a story about a poor, low-rank samurai whose life is turned upside down by his enemy. In 1925, Bantsuma starred in Kageboshi, another screenplay written by Rokuhei, this time depicting the life of the ‚Äòjovial thief‚Äô, Kageboshi. =Bantsuma: The Producer= At the height of his fame, Bantsuma established his own agency in the summer of 1925. It was the first independent production company to be headed by a film star in the history of Japanese cinema. Bantsuma owned most of the rights and would go through the specific scenes and details with the directors. He is said to have been very demanding but his colleagues have explained that this was merely a reflection of his eager and enthusiastic approach to making films. During this time, Bantsuma practically lived in Gion being entertained by geisha. It is also well known that he liked to flaunt his cash and he often treated his co-workers to a night in Gion with sometimes up to 20 geisha in one room. In 1926 Bantsuma built a studio outside Kyoto where the Toei Kyoto studio now stands. By far the most controversial film made under Bantsuma Productions was its second production, Orochi (1925). The story revolves around the protagonist, Heizaburo Kuritomi, an honorable but low- class samurai who is given an emotional depth, previously unseen in jidaigeki films, as he battles with inner conflict and the injustices of society. This is especially evident in the closing sequence of the film where the protagonist is dragged away by his enemies after his tremendous effort to protect his love. In the essay, \\"Bantsuma's 'New Breeze'\\", Midori Sawato cites the ending of Orochi as one of the most 'heroic and heart-crushing' images she has seen. In the past, the heroes of the films were proud samurai of the upper classes who always triumphed over their evil opponents, upholding what was truly right in the world. However, Orochi was created in response to the national and military fanaticism that was prevailing at the time. With its now-famous opening lines: > ‚ÄòNot all those who wear the name of villain, are truly evil men. Not all > those who are respected as noble men, are worthy of the name. Many are those > who wear a false mask of benevolence to hide their treachery and the > wickedness of their true selves,‚Äô the film evoked provocative ideologies and rebellious ideas during a time where liberal performers and writers were being repressed throughout Japan. Consequently, the film was severely censored with over 20% of its content being completely cut out and several scenes having to be re-shot. When the film was finally released, the hype around its creation resulted in crowds flocking to theaters all around the country. Bantsuma's exhilarating new sword fighting style he displayed in the film may have attracted audiences but it cannot be denied that there were many who were also deeply touched by the profound message of the film. Bantsuma went on to produce many films under his production company, but Orochi was the only one he personally kept the negative for. His agency hit a low point during the period 1931‚Äì1935. During this time, his production company was very much a ‚Äòone-man agency‚Äô, where the directors were only acting to please Bantsuma. His acting skills gradually became old and outdated so his films did not do very well. In 1935, Bantsuma worked with the renowned director Hiroshi Inagaki in his first talkie film, Niino Tsuruchiyo (1935), but his rather feeble voice was unpopular with the audience. It seemed that Bantsuma's luck was running out and in 1936 he closed the doors of his agency once and for all, and joined Nikkatsu Production Company in 1937. =Bantsuma: The Swordsman= Bantsuma's films, particularly his earlier works, would not be complete without the fast-paced sword fighting scenes that always guaranteed to raise the heart rate of his audience. Fighting styles had always been set, especially in Kabuki performances and actors were limited to doing standard moves such as the 'Yamagata', 'Yanagi', or the 'Chijihataka'. However, with the emergence of Bantsuma this changed and he introduced a completely new style which was unique to him alone. Ryu Kuze, a sword fighting coach analyzed Bantsuma's technique and put his uniqueness down to the fact that he does not look at his victims when he slays them. Instead, he is already focused on his next victim. Ryu Kuze also pointed out that Bantsuma would stand straight with his ankles lined up which was his signature pose that signaled death for his opponent. His colleagues often spoke of their admiration for Bantsuma's enthusiasm and quick ability to pick up new moves and sequences. Bantsuma's spectacular sword skills soon earned him the title, ‚ÄòThe King of Swordfights.‚Äô =Bantsuma: The Writer= Bantsuma's first son, Takahiro Tamura, described his father as ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô and affected by everything occurring around him. He wrote several articles for magazines such as Bantsuma Cinema News and displayed his sensitivity, as well as giving the audience an insight into his mentality. In the November 1929 issue of Bantsuma Cinema News, he wrote, ‚ÄòThe life of an artist is to die for art. Only when art is one‚Äôs life can one produce real art. As I have a long way to go, I will continue down this path while with such belief.‚Äô His determination and dedication in what he did is evident in the statement he made in the February 1930 issue of the same magazine. He wrote, > ‚ÄòWhen creating such a film, I am not an actor, but actually am in the shoes > of the character in the film, feeling what he feels, and I suffer the same > agony as that character. I must play numerous characters and their diverse > personalities one after another. I am no God. Sometimes I feel myself > screaming inside‚Ä¶you cannot claim with confidence that you are speaking the > mind of the character with only a half-developed understanding of that > character. Being able to fully depict the character comes only after > bleeding and suffering in agony in the process.‚Äô Bantsuma was truly a man of many talents. =Family life= Bantsuma and his wife Shizuko Tamura had four sons together ‚Äî Takahiro Tamura, Masakazu Tamura, Ry≈ç Tamura, and Toshima Tamura. Three followed in their father's footsteps, launching careers in the movie industry. Toshima became a businessperson. His first son, Takahiro Tamura (who died on 16 May 2006 from a cerebral infarction), often spoke fondly about his father in interviews and gave valuable insights. The family often spent their summers at the beach in Amanohashidate and, as Takahiro recalled, Bantsuma would splash around in the water, even more excited than his brothers. He also spoke of the memory of his father's reaction to the results of his junior high school examination. Too nervous to go to the school and check, the good news was delivered by the teacher. Takahiro distinctly remembered his father bounding down the stairs and bowing in front of the teacher till his forehead touched the floor, almost as if shooting a scene from one of his jidaigeki films. Many people think that Bantsuma's true nature can be seen in Yabure Daiko (1949), where he plays the role of a tyrannical man feared by his family. He was the complete opposite, always putting his family first. The role he played in Abare Jishi of a father who would do anything for his children is a more accurate representation of Bantsuma, who was an affectionate and well-rounded family man. However, Bantsuma's dedication to his work was also strong, and he returned to the set, ready to work, the day after his wedding. =Later Film Career= It seems that Bantsuma's sensitivity was beginning to make its way into the work he was producing. A year after entering Nikkatsu, Bantsuma co-starred with Kataoka Chiezo in the all-star film, Chushingura (1938). Playing the role of Kuranosuke Oishi, Bantsuma displayed his perfected acting skills with his powerful performance. Then in 1943 he starred in the film Muho matsu no Issho, playing a poor rickshaw man. It was a role that would not normally have been taken on by such a great star but director Hiroshi Inagaki, whom Bantsuma had previously worked with, was determined to get him on board. After initially turning down the role, Bantsuma finally agreed and went on to play a role with a profound humanistic approach that lent great depth to both the character and the movie. In preparation for the role of the poor rickshaw man, Bantsuma stayed in character even whilst at home. His first son, Takahiro Tamura described watching his father eat dried fish and drink sake in the style of the character of the film. During this period of his career, Japan soon lost the war and the US army began to restrict Jidaigeki as a ‚Äòhotbed of feudalism.‚Äô Thus, the stars of Jidaigeki formed troupes and traveled around the country. During this time, Bantsuma perfected his skills further and in 1948 he peaked once again with his performance in the film ≈åsh≈ç. Director Daisuke It≈ç spoke of Bantsuma's wide range and depth, his convincing and humanistic portrayal of the protagonist, and stated that despite his big status in the film industry, Bantsuma was the obvious choice for the part of Sankichi, a man of the lowest social ranks. On 7 July 1953, Bantsuma died at the age of 51 of cerebral hemorrhage while filming Abare-Jishi. A grave has been built in his memory in Nisonin, Kyoto and Bantsuma lives on through the continued popularity of his films and the impact he made to the history of Japanese cinema.

Causes Thermal, chemical or mechanical stress can cause split ends. For example, the use of curling irons and other heat treatments may cause split ends. Excessive application of hair products such as perms and hair coloring may strip protective layering off the outside of the hair's shaft and weaken the hair, making the hair prone to split ends. Mechanical stresses include pulling a comb forcefully through tangled hair and repeated combing. Split ends can be a symptom of copper transport disorders such as Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome. Rubbing the hair up towards the scalp does not cause split ends. Treatment There is no remedy for split ends beyond trimming the affected hair. Some products claim to heal split ends by sealing the ends back together. Prevention Reducing or eliminating the causes will usually prevent split ends. Trimming the ends of the hair at least every 6‚Äì 10 weeks may prevent split ends. Also, hair at the highest risk for splitting can be removed.

It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of mestranol include nausea, breast tension, edema, and breakthrough bleeding among others. It is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body. Mestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill. In 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills, although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today. Mestranol remains available only in a few countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. Medical uses Mestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand name Enovid) and mestranol/norethisterone (brand names Ortho-Novum, Norinyl), and is still in use today. In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive, mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Side effects Pharmacology Ethinylestradiol (EE), the active form of mestranol. Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver (via O-Dealkylation) with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50 Œºg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 Œºg of ethinylestradiol). It has been found to possess 0.1 to 2.3% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol (100%) for the estrogen receptor, compared to 75 to 190% for ethinylestradiol. The elimination half-life of mestranol has been reported to be 50 minutes. The elimination half-life of the active form of mestranol, ethinylestradiol, is 7 to 36 hours. The effective ovulation- inhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied in women. It has been reported to be about 98% effective at inhibiting ovulation at a dosage of 75 or 80 Œºg/day. In another study, the ovulation rate was 15.4% at 50 Œºg/day, 5.7% at 80 Œºg/day, and 1.1% at 100 Œºg/day. Chemistry Mestranol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether (EEME) or as 17Œ±-ethynyl-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17Œ≤-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol (17Œ±-ethynylestradiol) with a methyl ether at the C3 position. History In April 1956, noretynodrel was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in the first large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1‚Äì2%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 Œºg mestranol per pill. Around 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved, which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism. Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed. Society and culture =Generic names= Mestranol is the generic name of the drug and its , , , , , and , while mestranolo is its .https://www.drugs.com/international/mestranol.html =Brand names= Mestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names, mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins, including Devocin, Enavid, Enovid, Femigen, Mestranol, Norbiogest, Ortho-Novin, Ortho-Novum, Ovastol, and Tranel among others. Today, it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion, Necon, Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, and Sophia. =Availability= Mestranol remains available only in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. It is only marketed in combination with progestins, such as norethisterone. Research Mestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective. At a dosage of 0.45 mg/day, it suppressed gonadotropin levels, reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6 weeks, and decreased libido, erectile function, and testicular size. Gynecomastia occurred in all of the men. These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men.

Those involved in the movement were called patarini (singular patarino), patarines or patarenes, a word chosen by their opponents, the etymology of which is unclear. The movement, associated with urban unrest in the city of Milan, is generally considered to have begun in 1057 and ended in 1075. History Early in the year 1057, a preacher named Ariald arrived in the city of Milan and began to preach against the Milanese clerics' custom of marrying., p. 13: \\"Inizia, tra la fine del 1056 e i primi del 1057, la Pataria milanese It is possible that he took advantage of the absence at this time of the Archbishop of Milan, Guido, who was in Germany in August at the Council of Tribur. The Milanese clergy grew concerned by Ariald's attempt to whip up the city against them, and sent envoys to Pope Stephen IX in Rome. On hearing this, Ariald travelled to Rome himself. Pope Stephen IX was sympathetic to Ariald's position, and sent two envoys to Milan, Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII) and Anselm of Baggio (later Pope Alexander II). Ariald also returned to Milan, and now began to criticise the Milanese clerics' practice of simony, resulting in urban unrest. Ariald's close associate Landulf Cotta was attacked, and later died from his injuries. In 1059 Ariald travelled to Rome again to seek advice; Pope Stephen IX again sent envoys to Milan, this time Peter Damian and again Anselm of Baggio, but this did nothing to quell the unrest in the city. In 1063, Landulf Cotta's brother Erlembald went to Rome where he obtained a papal banner from the newly elected Pope Alexander II in support of the Pataria movement. In 1066, Pope Alexander II finally excommunicated Archbishop Guido. Guido used this excommunication however to whip up the citizens' anger against the Paterenes at a public meeting, and Ariald was first chased out of the city of Milan, and then assassinated, in June 1066. However, when Ariald's body was found in May 1067, it quickly became the object of a cult, and popular opinion in Milan swung back behind the Pataria., p. 18 Archbishop Guido was forced out of the city, leaving it under the control of Erlembald, and Alexander II formally proclaimed Ariald to be a saint in 1068. Archbishop Guido resigned in 1068, in favour of his associate Gotofredo da Castiglione, who was also supported by Emperor Henry IV. The papacy and the Pataria however supported a different candidate as archbishop, Attone, and Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Gotofredo in 1074. Rioting in Milan led to the murder of Erlembald in 1075, and after this point the Pataria movement lost much of its energy. The controversy over the appointment of the archbishop of Milan continued, however, and contributed to the political tensions between Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII.  Medieval historiography  There are several contemporary and nearly- contemporary sources for the Pataria, each of which offers different and sometimes contradictory perspectives., pp. 23-34 These include: *Andrew of Strumi's Life of Saint Ariald *Bonizo of Sutri's Liber ad amicum *Arnulf of Milan's Deeds of the Archbishops of Milan *Landulf Senior's History of Milan  Modern historiography  As Paolo Golinelli has emphasised, modern debates about the Pataria have often centred on whether the Pataria was primarily a religious movement, or whether it was instead the religious expression of social tensions within the city and region of Milan., p. 59 The Italian historian Gioacchino Volpe, for instance, argued in 1907 that the Pataria was a class conflict between the elites of Milan and the lower-status population. This interpretation was also supported by Ernst Werner in 1956. For Hagen Keller, the Pataria is best understood as part of the history of the emergence of the Italian commune. More recently, historians such as Herbert Cowdrey have emphasised the movement's essentially religious nature. Many historians have associated the movement with wider reforming trends in the Church. For William North, the Pataria was 'the longest... and most violent of the popular responses to the call for ecclesiastical reform in the eleventh century'.William North, 'The Pataria: Andrea da Strumi's Passion of Arialdo', in Katherine Jansen et al. (eds)., Medieval Italy, Texts in Translation (2009), p. 337 In his article on religious change in the eleventh century, R.I. Moore discussed the Pataria extensively as a major part of the 'appearance of the crowd on the stage of public events', which he sees as being brought into being by religious reform (itself however a response to social change). In a recent article, Piroska Nagy has suggested a new path of interpretation by analysing the collective emotions of the movement.

It was written by Steven Tyler and professional songwriters Richie Supa and Glen Ballard. It was released as the third major single from Nine Lives in 1997. Composition The song is highlighted by a harmonica performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning, as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song, and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses. Many of the lines in the verses start with the word \\"pink\\" (e.g. \\"Pink it's my new obsession \\", \\"Pink it's not even a question\\", \\"Pink on the lips of your lover\\"). The song is also highly suggestive, in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a woman's reproductive organs, particularly the inner side of the outer lips ‚Äì the \\"pink in the middle\\" ‚Äì and also the man's penis ‚Äì \\"I wanna wrap you in rubber\\" and \\"my favorite crayon\\" Chart positions The song reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 38 in the United Kingdom, and No. 19 in Latvia. It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks. Music video The music video for the song used CGI to morph characters' faces to other bodies. A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera, morphing into different characters in the process (e.g., Joe Perry as a centaur, Brad Whitford as a little boy, Steven Tyler as a skeleton, and a boy dressed as the Easter Bunny). It was directed by Doug Nichol. Two versions of the music video exist. In the uncensored version, there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera. For a brief second, the top, unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away, revealing her right breast. There is another instance where a woman's breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman, painted blue and green, does a pirouette. The uncensored version caused minor controversy and MTV asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings. As a result, the edited version censored the pirouette scene. The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a two-headed man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present. Live performances As of 2007, \\"Pink\\" is one of only two songs from Nine Lives consistently played on Aerosmith tours, along with \\"Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)\\".  Track listing   Covers and other versions  A different version of the song, The South Beach Mix, was included on the career-spanning compilation O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits. Japanese edition of the \\"Pink\\" single from 'Nine Lives' features six tracks: three mixes of \\"Pink\\" (Album Version, The South Beach Mix & Live from the Howard Stern Radio Show), plus live versions of \\"Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\\" & \\"Walk This Way\\" recorded in March 1997. As well, there is a techno remix of \\"Falling in Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\\" titled Moby Fucked Remix. It is a bonus playable song in the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, and the only track from Nine Lives present in the game. In the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of this game, the word \\"high\\" (in \\"Pink gets me high as a kite\\") is removed. Awards The song won the band their fourth and most recent Grammy award in 1999 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Additionally, the video won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1998.\\"Madonna, Prodigy, Will Smith, Aerosmith Win Big At Video Music Awards\\" MTV news, September 10, 1998.

She is best known as the former executive editor of The New York Times; Abramson held that position from September 2011 to May 2014. She was the first female executive editor in the paper's 160-year history. Abramson joined the New York Times in 1997, working as the Washington bureau chief and managing editor before being named as executive editor. She previously worked for The Wall Street Journal as an investigative reporter and a deputy bureau chief. In March 2016, she was hired as a political columnist for Guardian US. In 2019, she received widespread criticism from journalists after her book Merchants Of Truth was found to contain plagiarized passages and numerous factual errors, though Abramson's book was praised for its accuracy by Donald Trump. In 2012, she was ranked number five on Forbes list of most powerful women. She was also named as one of the 500 most powerful people in the world by Foreign Policy. Early life and education Abramson was born in New York City and grew up in a Jewish home. She received her high school diploma from Ethical Culture Fieldston School and a BA in History and Literature from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1976. Career While a Harvard undergraduate, she was the Arts Editor of The Harvard Independent, and worked at Time magazine from 1973 to 1976. Subsequently, she spent nearly a decade as a senior staff reporter for The American Lawyer. In 1986, she was appointed as editor in chief of Legal Times in Washington, D.C., serving for two years. From 1988 to 1997, she was a senior reporter in the Washington bureau of The Wall Street Journal, eventually rising to deputy bureau chief. She joined The New York Times in 1997, becoming its Washington bureau chief in December 2000. Abramson was the Times' Washington Bureau chief during the turbulent period of Spring 2003 during the run-up to the war in Iraq and the Jayson Blair scandal, which led to the resignation of Executive Editor Howell Raines and Managing Editor Gerald Boyd. In a February 2013 interview, Abramson spoke of the conflict she had with Raines as D.C. bureau chief, saying, \\"Howell from the get-go just had no use for me. ... I did think about quitting.\\" Abramson was named to the news managing editor position (with co-Managing Editor John M. Geddes) by Raines' successor Bill Keller. In 1995, Abramson and her The Wall Street Journal colleague (and fellow Fieldston alumna) Jane Mayer co-authored Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas, which detailed circumstances surrounding the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas. Maureen Dowd would later write of having bonded with Abramson during that time. From 2000 to 2001, she was a professor at Princeton University. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In February 2007, Abramson testified in the perjury trial of Scooter Libby, United States v. Libby. She was called as a defense witness to undercut the credibility of Judith Miller. In 2010, Abramson worked on news content on the Times website for six months. On June 2, 2011, Abramson became the executive editor of the Times, replacing Bill Keller who stepped down from the position to become a full-time writer. Abramson was scheduled to address the commencement exercises of Barnard College on May 14, 2012. Her speech was canceled after President Barack Obama requested to speak instead. She received an honorary degree at Fairleigh Dickinson's 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012. In April 2013, Abramson was the subject of a sharply critical profile in Politico written by Dylan Byers entitled \\"Turbulence at the Times,\\" in which anonymous Times staffers called her \\"impossible\\" and \\"very, very unpopular.\\" Abramson was deeply distressed by the report, later saying it made her cry. On May 14, 2014, Abramson was fired from her position as executive editor of the Times, and Dean Baquet succeeded her in that role. Abramson was reportedly fired because of \\"her arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication, and mistreatment of colleagues\\". Five days later, she delivered the commencement address at Wake Forest University. During the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Abramson argued in a column for Guardian US that Hillary Clinton, whom she had covered as a reporter and editor since the Whitewater controversy, was \\"fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\\" On February 19, 2018, Abramson followed up her 1995 book on Clarence Thomas and the Anita Hill hearings with a discussion concerning new evidence that Thomas had committed perjury which might be tied to possible impeachment.Jill Abramson. \\"Do You Believe Her Now?\\" New York Magazine. February 19, 2018. Abramson indicated that her reporting was initiated by an article by the journalist Marcia Coyle from 2016 when Abramson stated, \\"Tipped to the post by a Maryland legal source who knew Smith (who made the allegations), Marcia Coyle, a highly regarded and scrupulously nonideological Supreme Court reporter for The National Law Journal, wrote a detailed story about (Moira) Smith‚Äôs allegation of butt-squeezing, which included corroboration from Smith‚Äôs roommates at the time of the dinner and from her former husband. Coyle‚Äôs story, which Thomas denied, was published October 27, 2016\\". In December 2018, Fox News reported that Abramson's book Merchants of Truth criticized her former employer the Times of abandoning objectivity and becoming \\"anti-Trump\\" to bolster profits. Abramson responded by stating that the Fox News review \\"distorts and takes what I wrote totally out of context\\" and praised the Times along with The Washington Post for their \\"superb coverage of the corruption enveloping the Trump administration, the best investigative reporting I‚Äôve seen.\\" In February 2019, Vice News correspondent Michael C. Moynihan said Abramson's book Merchants of Truth contained several instances of plagiarism, posting a series of tweets comparing passages of the book to passages of other publications, including Time Out, The Ryerson Review of Journalism, The New Yorker, The Columbia Journalism Review, and other works.Former New York Times editor Jill Abramson accused of plagiarizing in her new book (Entertainment Weekly)Former NY Times editor Jill Abramson accused of plagiarism (The Hill)Former N.Y. Times Editor to \\"Review\\" Book Passages After Plagiarism Claim (The Hollywood Reporter) In a February 7 interview on Fox News, Abramson said she had no comment on the plagiarism accusations, but later that evening said she would review the passages in question.Ex-New York Times editor Jill Abramson is reviewing passages in her new book after plagiarism allegations (CNN)Jill Abramson Faces Accusations of Plagiarism in New Book ‚ÄòMerchants of Truth‚Äô (Variety) However, in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Abramson admitted that she \\"fell short\\" in attributing her sources for some passages of the book. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Abramson said that most of the plagiarized text was cited in footnotes, but that was she was sorry that a few piece of text were not. Stelter pointed out to Abramson that lifting words from other sources and citing footnotes is still considered plagiarism. Personal life In 1981, she married Harvard classmate Henry Little Griggs III. Griggs was then president of Triad, a political public relations company. He is self- described as a \\"writer, editor and media-relations consultant specializing in nonprofit advocacy campaigns.\\" They have two children. In May 2007, Abramson was seriously injured in a truck-pedestrian crash near the New York Times headquarters in Times Square. She subsequently filed a lawsuit against the truck's driver, owner, and operator, who was involved in the crash, as well two companies involved in the crash. Abramson has four tattoos on her body that she describes as \\"telling the story of me.\\" They include a New York City Subway token; the letter \\"H,\\" representing her alma mater, Harvard University, and her husband, Henry; and the letter \\"T\\" in the Gothic font of the New York Times logo. Abramson first unveiled her New York Times tattoo on a New York interview show less than a month before being fired from the paper, saying that it, along with the 'H' tattoo represent \\"the two institutions that I revere, that have shaped me.\\" She has called her Times tattoo, which is emblazoned on her back, her \\"personal hieroglyphic.\\" However, although she worked at The Wall Street Journal for 10 years, she elected to not be similarly marked by that newspaper because \\"It just wasn't in my family's blood.\\" Bibliography * Where They Are Now: The Story of the Women of Harvard Law 1974.

The team currently campaigns four Ford Mustangs under two teams; with Cameron Waters and Jack Le Brocq driving for the Monster Energy & Supercheap Auto Racing Team along with Lee Holdsworth and James Courtney driving for the Truck Assist and Boost Mobile Racing Team. Tickford Racing also competes in the Dunlop Super2 Series with Broc Feeney. In 2020, they operated the 23Red Racing Mustang of Will Davison, but after the first two rounds 23Red withdrew from the category due to their major backing leaving as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team then leased the REC to continue fielding four cars, with Courtney joining the team from the third round onwards. The team has won the Bathurst 1000 twice, in 2013 (Winterbottom/Richards) and in 2014 (Mostert/Morris). They have won the driver's championship once, in 2015 with Mark Winterbottom. History =2000s= In December 2002, Prodrive purchased Glenn Seton Racing, and renamed it Ford Performance Racing as part of a marketing push to link the Prodrive-owned Ford Performance Vehicles road car range to the popular V8 Supercars. Along with this renaming came a huge expansion programme ‚Äì the team expanded from one car driven by Glenn Seton to three; Seton, Craig Lowndes and David Besnard. The team moved into a new headquarters adjacent to the FPV factory in Campbellfield, Melbourne, and the crew expanded as well. The third car was entered using Rod Nash Racing's Racing Entitlement Contract (REC). While other teams such had received major Ford support in the years since, it became the first official Ford factory team since the Ford Works Team of 1962 to 1973. The team's early years were somewhat disappointing, given the fact the team was one of the best funded in V8 Supercars. Lowndes had his moments in 2003, including a round win at Phillip Island, and a second-place finish at Bathurst driving with Seton. Lowndes finished the year 5th in the championship, with Seton and Besnard well down the order. In 2004, the team downsized to two cars. Lowndes and Seton both had disappointing years, plagued by engine dramas, a lack of test days, and a lack of comparable data (their cars were built to different specifications). While the pair did start to find some pace at the end of the year (they finished second at Bathurst again), they both decided to move at the end of the year ‚Äì Lowndes to Triple Eight Race Engineering and Seton to Dick Johnson Racing. Jason Bright and Greg Ritter joined for the 2005 season. Bright had a consistent year, and finished inside the top 10, while Ritter was disappointing, David Brabham replaced him for the final two rounds. In 2006, Mark Winterbottom joined the team. Bright scored multiple front-row starts, including three pole positions. He won the inaugural round in Bahrain, the Desert 400, and came 6th in the championship. Winterbottom enjoyed a very consistent run to finish third in the championship. The pair won the Sandown 500. FPR came second in the team's championship behind the HSV Dealer Team. Bright left FPR at the end of the 2006 season to drive for his own Britek Motorsport outfit, with Steven Richards recruited to replace him. The team continued to take the challenge to the front-running teams. The most disappointing moment in 2007 was when Winterbottom left the circuit late in the race while leading at Bathurst. In 2008 Winterbottom challenged for the championship, but Jamie Whincup managed to finish the championship ahead of Winterbottom while Richards finished 8th. In 2009, the new FG Falcon was debuted. While Triple Eight already had the speed, FPR struggled with only one win from Mark Winterbottom during the season with Steven Richards finishing a best of 3rd. The team also struggled at Bathurst again with the No. 6 car driven by Winterbottom and Richards caught fire on lap 50 while the second car driven by Dean Canto and Luke Youlden crashed late in the race. Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards finished 5th and 13th in the championship. =2010s= In 2010, Winterbottom finished 3rd and Richards 15th. For 2011, Will Davison replaced Richards, who was retained as an endurance co-driver for Winterbottom. Winterbottom finished in 3rd place for the championship while Davison finished in 7th. In 2012, FPR were strong challengers for the championship, Winterbottom finishing 3rd with Davison finishing 4th. In January 2013, the team was sold by Prodrive to Rusty French and Rod Nash.V8 team FPR sold to Melbourne-based pair Sydney Morning Herald 5 January 2013 In the 2013 season, Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards won the Bathurst 1000. Davison finished the season in third, Winterbottom fourth. Chaz Mostert joined the team in 2014, replacing Will Davison. FPR won the 2014 Bathurst 1000 with Mostert partnered by Paul Morris. In 2015, Ford Performance Racing was renamed as Prodrive Racing Australia, as a result of Ford's decision to progressively withdraw its V8 Supercars support by 2016. The team introduced the Ford FG X Falcon, the first new Falcon since 2009. After a slow start, the team achieved considerable success in the next section of the season, with eleven out of fifteen race wins between the third event (the Perth Super Sprint) and the eighth event (the Sydney Motorsport Park Super Sprint). Winterbottom, co-driving with Steve Owen, then went on to win the 2015 Wilson Security Sandown 500, leading home a team one-two with Mostert and Cameron Waters in second. It was the team's first win at the event since 2006. At the 2015 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000, Mostert had a substantial crash in Friday qualifying, ruling his car out for the weekend and himself out for the rest of the season. This left Winterbottom with a large championship lead entering the final rounds, and while he didn't win another race after Sandown, Winterbottom held on to win his, and the team's first drivers' championship. The team was leading the teams' championship until the final round, in which it was overtaken by long-time rivals Triple Eight. In 2016, Mostert was moved to customer team Rod Nash Racing for sponsorship purposes, with Cameron Waters joining the team full-time in car No. 6 alongside defending champion Winterbottom. The team only won 2 races, both with Winterbottom who finished the championship in 6th place. Waters finished his first season in 19th, with his best finish being 4th place at the Bathurst 1000 with Jack Le Brocq. In 2017 the team continued with the same driver lineup, with its only race win being the Sandown 500 with Waters and co-driver Richie Stanaway. Winterbottom finished the championship in 6th, while Waters finished in 8th place. In 2018, the team was rebranded as Tickford Racing, with Stanaway joining the team in car No. 56. The Rod Nash Racing REC was moved to the team with Mostert, officially making Tickford Racing a 4 car team.Prodrive confirms Tickford Racing name change Speedcafe 19 December 2017 Customer cars =Rod Nash Racing= From 2010 to 2017, the team has prepared a customer car for Rod Nash Racing. Paul Dumbrell drove in 2010 and 2011 before David Reynolds took over in 2012, with notable results being a race win at the 2013 Armor All Gold Coast 600, a second place at the 2012 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 and 3rd in the driver's championship in 2015, with Dean Canto as his co-driver. From 2016, Chaz Mostert raced with Rod Nash Racing, winning 3 races and the Pirtek Enduro Cup the following season with Steve Owen. The Rod Nash Racing REC is now run under the Tickford Racing name with Mostert and Owen. =Charlie Schwerkolt Racing= In 2013, the team took on a second customer car for Charlie Schwerkolt Racing. The Schwerkolt entry was driven by Alex Davison in 2013, with Jack Perkins replacing Davison for 2014. Schwerkolt and his team split with FPR prior to the 2015 season, moving to Walkinshaw Racing for 2015. =Super Black Racing= Super Black Racing replaced the No. 18 Schwerkolt entry for 2015, with Andre Heimgartner the driver of Car No. 111. Chris Pither replaced Heimgartner for the final two rounds of the 2015 season and continued with the team for 2016. After the 2016 season, the team sold its Racing Entitlement Contract to Tim Blanchard Racing. =Britek Motorsport= In 2017, Britek Motorsport replaced Super Black Racing as the team's second customer entry. Team owner Jason Bright drove the team's No. 56 entry with Garry Jacobson co-driving. After 2017, Bright retired from full-time driving and the REC was leased to Matt Stone Racing. =23Red Racing= After running its first Supercars season on its own, 23Red Racing became a satellite operation for 2019 with Tickford re-building the teams Ford Falcon into a Ford Mustang for the 2019 season. The car was driven by Will Davison, a former driver of FPR. In May 2020, 23Red Racing announced it was withdrawing from the Supercars Championship, due to the loss of their major backer Milwaukee Tools. This was a result of the economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The team was merged back to Tickford with a new number. =Other= Tickford Racing has run a number of customer cars for other franchise holders, the first in 2007 where the No. 021 Team Kiwi Racing BF Falcon driven by Paul Radisich was prepared for the first few rounds of the season.

Noyes is the northern terminus of U.S. Highway 75, and the site where the BNSF Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway enter Canada; the town of Emerson, Manitoba, is directly north of Noyes on the Canadian side of the border. History A post office called Noyes was established in 1927, and remained in operation until 1990. The community was named for J. A. Noyes, a customs agent. Today, Noyes is essentially a quiet community. Because of its proximity to the flood-prone Red River, it is protected by a levee which extends south from Emerson. The levee was built in 1989 as part of the International Levee agreement between both countries. When flooding cuts off Noyes from the rest of the United States, a local state of emergency is declared, allowing residents and emergency personnel to move freely across the border within the levee. =Customs and Immigration Station= Located in the extreme northwestern corner of the state on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, Noyes was an important border-crossing location going back to the days of ox roads and later was one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes for rail and road traffic. Since the construction of Interstate 29 on the North Dakota side of the nearby Red River, U.S. Highway 75 has declined in importance. The Canadian government closed Emerson port of entry opposite Noyes in 2003, while the Port of Noyes closed in 2006, leaving the U.S. 75 from the south the only access to Noyes. Travelers must now use the border crossing located less than to the west, but a trek from Noyes, through Pembina, North Dakota, to Interstate 29. The rail border crossing remains open, but is now managed by the Port of Pembina. The 1931 Colonial Revival Noyes Customs and Immigration Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a well-preserved example of the nation's first purpose-built border checkpoints at land crossings.

At the height of their popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, many brands of movie cameras came with a Wollensak Velostigmat lens. Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorders were prized for their robust construction and value. In the 1960s, Wollensak was the choice tape recorder for amateur home, school, and office uses. They were produced in both stereo and mono designs. The firm was founded in 1899 by Andrew Wollensak to produce camera shutters. At its peak in the 1950s, it employed over a thousand people. The company had several owners, including Revere Camera Company and 3M Company. Wollensak ceased operation in 1972. Camera equipment Wollensak began making camera lenses in 1902. The company also produced camera shutters for large format cameras. They made shutters such as the Betax, Alphax, Optimo and, for the Graflex Corporation, Rapax. The Betax shutters were patented in 1912 and remain popular for large format photographers today. Betax shutters are made in different sizes from size #0 to the huge size #5. These shutters are very reliable and relatively easy to repair. Wollensak purchased the Fastax high speed rotating-prism camera developed by Bell Labs from Western Electric, and developed it to a capability of 10,000 frame/s,. Fastax cameras were used for recording projectiles and explosions, including nuclear explosions. The cameras, with the rotating prism removed, were often used for \\"streak\\" and \\"smear\\" photography. See high speed photography. Wollensak only ever made one still camera, the \\"Stereo 10\\" 35 mm 3D Camera. They also made some shutters and formed a partnership with The Revere Camera Company that led to them offering some cameras (mostly 8 mm) under their name in the 1950s and early 1960s. Audio-visual 3M also used the Wollensak brand name on audio tape recorders for many years; the Wollensak recorders were solidly built with all-metal construction. They were among the first manufacturers of cassette decks, as well as 8-track decks for home use.

Cooper is best known as the production designer and creative consultant for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, the leading producer of American TV game shows. He joined the firm in 1960 and was associated with it until his death at age 79. Cooper was hired as a TV art director for NBC in 1949 where he worked on various shows, including Your Show of Shows, the Martin and Lewis Show (until it moved to Los Angeles), The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show, The Jimmy Durante Show and the game shows Haggis Baggis and Charge Account, among others. Through his association with NBC he knew Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood fame and contributed to the first version of that show. He was also responsible for the sets for the 1956 Orson Welles Broadway production of King Lear which lasted for only 21 performances. Cooper's best- known achievements were in creating set designs and game displays for TV quiz shows. He is credited with being the motivating force behind taking game shows from a simple table set in front of a drape to a full set designed for the show. The Goodson-Todman shows for which Cooper served as art director or creative consultant after 1960 include The Price Is Right, The Match Game (including The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour), What's My Line?, I've Got a Secret, To Tell the Truth, He Said, She Said (and its successor Tattletales), Family Feud, Beat the Clock, Password (and its revivals Password Plus and Super Password), Say When!!, the Jack Narz and Alex Trebek revivals of Concentration, Double Dare, Card Sharks, Mindreaders, The Better Sex, Now You See It, Blockbusters, Child's Play, Body Language, and Trivia Trap, as well as assorted pilots. In addition to being the scenic designer of Say When!!, he was also the associate producer of that show. Cooper's design for \\"Say When\\" was among the first uses of alpha-numeric electronic readouts on TV and in the U.S., and helped the Split-flap display to become so popular for a time on TV and in other venues. Cooper's designs typically included technology not only for displaying numbers and letters, but also technology for controlling electromechanical devices such as lights and sound effects. Most of his designs were executed without the benefit of computer-generated special effects for which the industry is known today, but one of his shows, Classic Concentration, was one of the earliest shows to implement its game board on a fully computerized display. Many of his sets utilized rotating elements: Family Feud, Match Game, Card Sharks and The Price Is Right with its well- known turntable. Game show producer Dan Enright, whose shows competed with those of Goodson-Todman, once referred to Cooper as \\"Mark Goodson's secret weapon\\". For the 1958 Barry and Enright game show Concentration, which aired on NBC for 15 years before moving into syndication, he created the display that showed the list of prizes as the contestants matched them. The display did not show a stagehand slipping in the name of the prize on the side, but rather had the prize name in place obscured by a sliding front cover which would then be pulled to the side to reveal the prize name. For the syndicated version of Concentration, Cooper devised the \\"Head Start\\" feature in which four prizes were revealed prior to the start of the game. The prizes revealed were \\"fee items\\" for which the producers received a fee for being plugged on the show. \\"Head Start\\" guaranteed that the copy for those fee items was read and the fee collected regardless of whether or not the prizes were won during the game. For the 1972 version of The Price Is Right Cooper created the pricing games Any Number and Range Game. The physical game devices and other set pieces used on that version of the show prior to 2000 were designed by Cooper himself or under his supervision. Cooper designed the psychedelic set for the 1969 syndicated revival of To Tell the Truth. The brightly colored panels and elegant lettering he supervised for the show's set in the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York gave a modern, youthful feel to a show that had already been a success for 12 years on CBS. Cooper was a gold card member of IATSE Local 829, the United Scenic Artists, and for several years until his retirement was the oldest working member of that union.

He is also credited as being the first person to utilise the name Australia to describe the entirety of that continent including Van Diemen's Land, a title he regarded as being \\"more agreeable to the ear\\" than previous names such as Terra Australis. Flinders was involved in several voyages of discovery between 1791 and 1803, the most famous of which are the circumnavigation around Australia and an earlier expedition where he and George Bass confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. While returning to England in 1803, Flinders was arrested by the French governor at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but he remained under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales ‚Äì a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie. Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he returned to England in 1810, he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas, A Voyage to Terra Australis. The location of his grave was lost by the mid-19th century but archaeologists, excavating a former burial ground near London's Euston railway station for the High Speed 2 (HS2) project, announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified. Early life Matthew Flinders was born in Donington, Lincolnshire, England, the son of Matthew Flinders, a surgeon, and his wife Susannah, n√©e Ward. He was educated at Cowley's Charity School, Donington, from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglar's Grammar School at Horbling in Lincolnshire.Matthew Flinders ‚Äì his life in Donington South Holland Life. Accessed 14 July 2017. In his own words, he was \\"induced to go to sea against the wishes of my friends from reading Robinson Crusoe\\", and in 1789, at the age of fifteen, he joined the Royal Navy. Under the patronage of Captain Thomas Pasley, Flinders was initially assigned to as a servant, but was soon transferred as an able-seaman to , and then in July 1790 was made midshipman on . Early career =Midshipman to Captain Bligh= In May 1791, on Pasley's recommendation, Flinders joined Captain William Bligh's expedition on transporting breadfruit from Tahiti to Jamaica. This was Bligh's second \\"Breadfruit Voyage\\" following on from the ill-fated voyage of HMS Bounty. The expedition sailed via the Cape of Good Hope and in February 1792, they arrived at Adventure Bay in the south of what is now called Tasmania. The officers and crew spent over a week in the region obtaining water and lumber, and interacting with local Aboriginal people. This was Flinders' first direct association with the Australian continent. After the expedition arrived in Tahiti in April 1792, obtaining the many breadfruit plants to take to Jamaica, they sailed back west. Instead of travelling via Adventure Bay, Bligh navigated to the north of the Australian continent, sailing through the Torres Strait. Here, off Zagai Island, they were involved in a naval skirmish with armed local men in a flotilla of sailing canoes, which resulted in the death of several Islanders and one crewman. The expedition arrived in Jamaica in February 1793, offloading the breadfruit plants, and then returned to England with Flinders disembarking in London in August 1793 after more than two years at sea. =HMS Bellerophon= In September 1793, Flinders re-joined under the command of Captain Pasley. In 1794 Flinders served on this vessel during the battle known as the Glorious First of June, the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. Flinders wrote a detailed journal of this intense battle including how Captain Pasley \\"lost his leg by an 18-pound shot, which came through the barricading of the quarter- deck.\\" Both Pasley and Flinders survived, with Flinders deciding to pursue a preference for exploratory rather than military naval commissions. Exploration around New South Wales Flinders' desire for adventure led him to enlist as a midshipman aboard in 1795. This vessel was headed to New South Wales carrying the recently appointed governor of that British colony, Captain John Hunter. On this voyage Flinders established himself as a fine navigator and cartographer, and became friends with the ship's surgeon George Bass who was three years his senior and had been born from Donington. =Expeditions in Tom Thumb and Tom Thumb II= HMS Reliance arrived in Port Jackson in September 1795, and Bass and Flinders soon organised an expedition in a small open boat named Tom Thumb in which they sailed with a boy called Martin to Botany Bay and up the Georges River. In March 1796, the two explorers again with the boy Martin, set out on another voyage in a similar boat dubbed Tom Thumb II.The Journal of Daniel Paine 1794‚Äì1797 p. 39 They sailed south from Port Jackson but were soon forced to beach at Red Point (Port Kembla). At this place they accepted the help of two Aboriginal men who piloted the boat to the entrance of Lake Illawarra. Here they were able to dry their gunpowder and obtain supplies of water from another group of Aboriginal people. During the return to Sydney they had to seek shelter at Wattamolla and also explored some of Port Hacking (Deeban). =Circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land= Chart of Van Diemen's Land produced by Matthew Flinders In 1798, Matthew Flinders, now a lieutenant, was given command of the sloop with orders \\"to sail beyond Furneaux's Islands, and, should a strait be found, pass through it, and return by the south end of Van Diemen's Land\\". Flinders and Bass had in the months previously both made separate journeys exploring the region but neither were conclusive toward the existence of a strait. Flinders, with Bass and several crewmen, sailed the Norfolk along the uncharted northern and western coasts of Van Diemen's Land, rounded Cape Pillar and returned to Furneaux Island's. By doing so, Flinders had completed the circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land and confirmed the presence of a strait between it and the mainland. The passage was named Bass Strait after his close friend, and the largest island in the strait would later be named Flinders Island in his honour. During the voyage, Flinders and Bass rowed the ship's dinghy for some miles up the Derwent River where they had their only encounter with Aboriginal Tasmanians.In the wake of Bass and Flinders: 200 years on: the story of the re-enactment voyages 200 years on...

Retrieved on 2 August 2013. =Expedition to Hervey Bay= 1799 Flinders Expedition plaque at Mt Beerburrum In 1799 Flinders' request to explore the coast north of Port Jackson was granted and once more the sloop Norfolk was assigned to him. Bass had by this stage returned to England and in his place Flinders recruited his brother Samuel Flinders and a Kuringgai man named Bungaree for the voyage. They departed on 8 July 1799 and arrived in Moreton Bay six days later. He rowed ashore at Woody Point () and named a point west of that () as \\"Redcliffe\\" (on account of its red cliffs). That point is now known as Clontarf Point, while the name Redcliffe is used by the town of Redcliffe to the north. He landed on Coochiemudlo Island () on 19 July while he was searching for a river in the southern part of Moreton Bay. In the northern part of Moreton Bay, Flinders explored a narrow waterway () which he named the Pumice Stone River (presumably unaware it separated Bribie Island and the mainland); it is now called the Pumicestone Passage. Most of the meetings between the Aboriginal people of Moreton Bay and Flinders were of a friendly nature, but on 15 July at the southern tip of Bribie Island, a spear was thrown which resulted in a local man being wounded by gunfire. Flinders named the place where this occurred Point Skirmish. While anchored in Pumicestone, Flinders ventured several kilometres overland with three crew including Bungaree and climbed Mt Beeburrum. They turned back after meeting the steep cliffs of Mount Tibrogargan on about 26 July. Exiting Moreton Bay, Flinders continued north exploring as far as Hervey Bay before returning south. They arrived back in Sydney on August 20 1799.  Command of Investigator  Flinders in 1801 In March 1800, Flinders rejoined Reliance and returned to England. During the voyage, the Antipodes Islands were discovered and charted.Robert McNab, Murihiku and the Southern Islands, Invercargill, W. Smith, 1907, p.68. Flinders' work had come to the attention of many of the scientists of the day, in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks, to whom Flinders dedicated his Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemen's Land, on Bass's Strait, etc.. Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of , a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to commander the following month. Investigator set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801. Attached to the expedition were the botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, landscape artist William Westall, gardener Peter Good, geological assistant John Allen, and John Crosley as astronomer.Vallance, T.G., Moore, D.T. & Groves, E.W. 2001. Nature's Investigator The Diary of Robert Brown in Australia, 1801-1805, Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra, (p.7) Vallance et al. comment that compared to the Baudin expedition this was a 'modest contingent of scientific gentlemen', which reflects 'British parsimony' in scientific endeavour.  Exploration of the Australian coastline  =Surveying the southern coast= Flinders in InvestigatorAboard Investigator, Flinders reached and named Cape Leeuwin on 6 December 1801, and proceeded to make a survey along the southern coast of the Australian mainland.Dany Br√©elle, 'Matthew Flinders's Australian Toponymy and its British Connections', The Journal of the Hakluyt Society, November 2013 Captain M. K. Barritt, RN, 'Matthew Flinders's Survey Practices and Records', The Journal of the Hakluyt Society, March 2014 The expedition soon anchored in King George Sound and stayed there for a month exploring the area. The local Aboriginal people initially indicated that Flinders' group should \\"return from whence they came\\", but relations improved to the point where one resident participated in musket-drill with the ship's marines. In nearby Oyster Harbour, Flinders found a copper plate that Captain Christopher Dixson, on , had left the year before. While approaching Port Lincoln, which Flinders named after his home county of Lincolnshire, eight of his crew were lost when the small boat they were attempting to get to land with, capsized. Flinders named nearby Memory Cove in their honour. On 21 March 1802, the expedition reached a large island where many kangaroos were sighted. Flinders and some crew went ashore and found the animals so tame they could walk right up to them. They killed 31 kangaroos with Flinders writing that \\"in gratitude for so seasonable a supply [of meat], I named this southern land Kangaroo Island.\\" The seals on the island proved less docile with a crew member receiving a severe bite from one. On 8 April 1802, while sailing east, Flinders sighted , a French corvette commanded by the explorer Nicolas Baudin, who was on a similar expedition for his government. Both men of science, Flinders and Baudin exchanged details of their discoveries, despite believing that their countries were at war. Flinders named the bay in which they met Encounter Bay. Proceeding along the coast, Flinders explored Port Phillip (the site of the future city of Melbourne), which, unknown to him, had been explored only ten weeks earlier by John Murray aboard . Flinders scaled Arthur's Seat, the highest point near the shores of the southernmost parts of the bay, and wrote that the land had \\"a pleasing and, in many parts, a fertile appearance\\". After scaling the You Yangs to the northwest of Port Phillip on 1 May, he left a scroll of paper with the ship's name on it and deposited it in a small pile of stones at the top of the peak. With stores running low, Flinders proceeded to Sydney, arriving on 9 May 1802. =Circumnavigation of Australia= Flinders spent 12 weeks in Sydney resupplying and enlisting further crew for the continuation of the expedition to the northern coast of Australia. Bungaree, an Aboriginal man who had accompanied him on his earlier coastal survey in 1799, joined the expedition as did another local Aboriginal man named Nanbaree.Bungaree Australian Dictionary of Biography. Accessed 9 November 2015. It was arranged that Captain John Murray and his vessel the Lady Nelson would accompany the Investigator as a supply ship on this voyage. Flinders set sail again on 22 July 1802, heading north and surveying the coast of what would later be called Queensland. They soon anchored at Sandy Cape where, with Bungaree acting as a mediator, they feasted on porpoise blubber with a group of Batjala people. In early August, Flinders sailed into a bay he named Port Curtis. Here the local people threw stones at them as they attempted to land. Flinders ordered muskets be fired above their heads to disperse them. The expedition continued north but navigation became increasingly difficult as they entered the Great Barrier Reef. The Lady Nelson was deemed too unseaworthy to continue, and Captain Murray sailed her back to Sydney with his crew and Nanbaree, who wanted to return home. Flinders exited the reefs near to the Whitsunday Islands and sailed Investigator north to the Torres Strait. On 29 October, they arrived at Murray Island in the east of this strait, where they traded iron for shell necklaces with the local people. The expedition entered the Gulf of Carpentaria on 4 November and charted the coast to Arnhem Land. At Blue Mud Bay the crew, while collecting timber, had a skirmish with local Aboriginal men. One of the crew received four spear wounds while two of the Aboriginal men were shot dead. At nearby Caledon Bay, Flinders took a 14 year old boy named Woga captive in order to coerce the local people to return a stolen axe. Although the axe was not returned, Flinders released the boy who spent a day tied to a tree. On 17 February 1803, near Cape Wilberforce, the expedition encountered a Makassan trepanging fleet captained by a man called Pobasso from whom Flinders obtained information about the region. During this part of the voyage much of the Investigator was discovered to be rotten, and Flinders made the decision to complete the circumnavigation of the continent without any further close surveying of the coast. He sailed to Sydney via Timor and around the western and southern coasts of Australia. On the way, Flinders jettisoned two wrought-iron anchors which were found by divers in 1973 at Middle Island, Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia.Christopher, P. & Cundell, N. (editors), (2004), Let's Go For a Dive, 50 years of the Underwater Explorers Club of SA, published by Peter Christopher, Kent Town, SA, pp. 45‚Äì49. This describes the search and recovery of the anchors by members of the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia These anchors are on display at the South Australian Maritime Museum and at the National Museum of Australia.Christopher, P. & Cundell, N. (editors), (2004), Let's Go For a Dive, 50 years of the Underwater Explorers Club of SA, published by Peter Christopher, Kent Town, SA, pp. 48 Arriving in Sydney on 9 June 1803, Investigator was subsequently judged to be unseaworthy and condemned.  Attempted return to England and imprisonment  Discussion of Flinders and Nicolas Baudin's race to map Australia Unable to find another vessel suitable to continue his exploration, Flinders set sail for England as a passenger aboard . However, the ship was wrecked on Wreck Reefs, part of the Great Barrier Reef, approximately north of Sydney. Flinders navigated the ship's cutter across open sea back to Sydney, and arranged for the rescue of the remaining marooned crew. Flinders then took command of the 29-ton schooner in order to return to England, but the poor condition of the vessel forced him to put in at French-controlled Isle de France (now known as Mauritius) for repairs on 17 December 1803, just three months after Baudin had died there. War with France had broken out again the previous May, but Flinders hoped his French passport (despite its being issued for Investigator and not Cumberland) and the scientific nature of his mission would allow him to continue on his way. Despite this, and the knowledge of Baudin's earlier encounter with Flinders, the French governor, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen, detained Flinders. The relationship between the men soured: Flinders was affronted at his treatment, and Decaen insulted by Flinders' refusal of an invitation to dine with him and his wife. Decaen was suspicious of the alleged scientific mission as the Cumberland carried no scientists and Decaen's search of Flinders' vessel uncovered a trunk full of papers (including despatches from the New South Wales Governor Philip Gidley King) that were not permitted under his scientific passport. Furthermore, one of King's despatches was specifically to the British Admiralty requesting more troops in case Decaen were to attack Port Jackson. Among the papers seized were the three logs of of which only Volume one and Volume two were returned to Flinders; these are now both held by the State Library of New South Wales. The third volume was later deposited in the Admiralty Library and is now held in the British Public Record Office. Decaen referred the matter to the French government; this was delayed not only by the long voyage but also by the general confusion of war. Eventually, on 11 March 1806, Napoleon gave his approval, but Decaen still refused to allow Flinders' release. By this stage Decaen believed Flinders' knowledge of the island's defences would have encouraged Britain to attempt to capture it. Nevertheless, in June 1809 the Royal Navy began a blockade of the island, and in June 1810 Flinders was paroled. Travelling via the Cape of Good Hope on , which was taking despatches back to Britain, he received a promotion to post-captain, before continuing to England. Flinders had been confined for the first few months of his captivity, but he was later afforded greater freedom to move around the island and access his papers.Dany Br√©elle, 'The Scientific Crucible of √éle de France: the French Contribution to the Work of Matthew Flinders', The Journal of the Hakluyt Society, June 2014 In November 1804 he sent the first map of the landmass he had charted (Y46/1) back to England. This was the only map made by Flinders where he used the name \\"Australia or Terra Australis\\" for the title instead of New Holland the name of the continent that James Cook had used in 1770 and Abel Tasman had coined a Dutch version of in 1644, and the first known time he used the word Australia.Matthew Flinders, General Chart of Terra Australis or Australia, London, 1814 He used the name New Holland on his map only for the western part of the continent. Due to the delay caused by his lengthy confinement, the first published map of the Australian continent was the Freycinet Map of 1811, a product of the Baudin expedition, issued in 1811. Flinders finally returned to England in October 1810. He was in poor health but immediately resumed work preparing A Voyage to Terra Australis and his atlas of maps for publication. The full title of this book, which was first published in London in July 1814, was given, as was common at the time, a synoptic description: A Voyage to Terra Australis: undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802, and 1803 in His Majesty's ship the Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland Schooner. With an account of the shipwreck of the Porpoise, arrival of the Cumberland at Mauritius, and imprisonment of the commander during six years and a half in that island . Original copies of the Atlas to Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis are held at the Mitchell Library in Sydney as a portfolio that accompanied the book and included engravings of 16 maps, four plates of views and ten plates of Australian flora.State Library of New South Wales /Catalogue .

Flinders' map of Terra Australis or Australia (so the two parts of the double name of his 1804 manuscript reversed) was first published in January 1814All maps published by the British H/Office are dated. and the remaining maps were published before his atlas and book. Death and reburial St James's Gardens, shown west of Euston railway station, on an 1890 Bacon Traveler's Pocket Map of London by George Washington Bacon Flinders died, aged 40, on 19 July 1814 from kidney disease, at his London home at 14 London Street, later renamed Maple Street and now the site of the BT Tower. This was on the day after the book and atlas was published; Flinders never saw the completed work as he was unconscious by that time, but his wife arranged the volumes on his bed covers so that he could touch them. On 23 July he was interred in the burial ground of St James's Church, Piccadilly, which was located some distance from the church, beside Hampstead Road, Camden, London. The burial ground was in use from 1790 until 1853. By 1852 the location of the grave had been forgotten due to alterations to the burial ground. In 1878 the cemetery became St James's Gardens, Camden, with only a few gravestones lining the edges of the park. Part of the gardens, located between Hampstead Road and Euston railway station, was built over when Euston station was expanded, and Flinders' grave was thought to possibly lie under a station platform.Miranda, C.: Skeleton of renowned explorer Matthew Flinders is lying in the path of London rail link ‚Äî and could be exhumed News Limited Network, 28 February 2014. Accessed 13 April 2014. The Gardens were closed to the public in 2017 for work on the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project which requires the expansion of Euston station. The grave was located in January 2019 by archaeologists.The announcement appeared in Australian media on 25 January, the day before Australia Day. His coffin was identified by its well-preserved lead coffin plate. It is proposed to re-bury his remains, at a site to be decided, after they have been examined by osteo-archaeologists. Church of St Mary and the Holy Rood, Donington, Lincolnshire Following the discovery of his grave the parish church of Donington, Lincolnshire, Flinders' birthplace, saw a surge of visitors. The 'Matthew Flinders Bring Him Home Group', which includes local and county representatives and the Britain- Australia Society, as well as Flinders' direct descendants. campaigned to have his remains interred at the church. On 17 October 2019 HS2 Ltd announced that Flinders remains will be reinterred in the parish Church of St Mary and the Holy Rood in Donington, where he was baptised. The Diocese of Lincoln has given planning consent for the reburial.  Family  On 17 April 1801, Flinders married his longtime friend Ann Chappelle (1772‚Äì1852) and had hoped to take her with him to Port Jackson. However, the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains. Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules, but the Admiralty learned of his plans and reprimanded him for his bad judgement, and ordered him to remove her from the ship. This is well documented in correspondence between Flinders and his chief benefactor, Sir Joseph Banks, in May 1801: As a result, Ann was obliged to stay in England and would not see her husband for nine years, following his imprisonment on the Isle de France (Mauritius, at the time a French possession) on his return journey. When they finally reunited, Matthew and Ann had one daughter, Anne, (1 April 1812 ‚Äì 1892), who later married William Petrie (1821‚Äì1908). In 1853, the governments of New South Wales and Victoria bequeathed a belated pension to her (deceased) mother of ¬£100 per year, to go to surviving issue of the union. This she accepted on behalf of her young son, William Matthew Flinders Petrie, who would go on to become an accomplished archaeologist and Egyptologist.

This celebration marked the first time the naming of Australia was formally recognised.\\"The chart that put Australia on the map\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 June 2004 Flinders was not the first to use the word \\"Australia\\", nor was he the first to apply the name specifically to the continent.\\"First Instance of the Word Australia being applied specifically to the Continent ‚Äì in 1794\\" Zoology of New Holland ‚Äì Shaw, George, 1751‚Äì1813; Sowerby, James, 1757‚Äì1822 Page 2. He owned a copy of Alexander Dalrymple's 1771 book An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, and it seems likely he borrowed it from there, but he applied it specifically to the continent, not the whole South Pacific region. In 1804 he wrote to his brother: \\"I call the whole island Australia, or Terra Australis\\". Later that year, he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and mentioned \\"my general chart of Australia\\", a map that Flinders had constructed from all the information he had accumulated while he was in Australian waters and finished while he was detained by the French in Mauritius. Flinders explained in his letter to Banks:Flinders to Banks, Isle of France (Mauritius), 23 March 1804, Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux-Board of Longitude Papers, RGO 14/51: 18 f.172 Flinders continued to promote the use of the word until his arrival in London in 1810. Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him, and that \\"New Holland\\" and \\"Terra Australis\\" were still in general use. As a result, a book by Flinders was published under the title A Voyage to Terra Australis and his published map of 1814 also shows 'Terra Australis' as the first of the two name options, despite his objections. The final proofs were brought to him on his deathbed, but he was unconscious. The book was published on 18 July 1814, but Flinders did not regain consciousness and died the next day, never knowing that his name for the continent would be accepted.The Weekend Australian, 30 ‚Äì 31 December 2000, p. 16 1744 Chart of Hollandia Nova ‚Äì Terra Australis by Emanuel Bowen Banks wrote a draft of an introduction to Flinders' Voyage, referring to the map published by Melchis√©dech Th√©venot in Relations des Divers Voyages (1663), and made well-known to English readers by Emanuel Bowen's adaptation of it, A Complete Map of the Southern Continent, published in John Campbell's editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744‚Äì48, and 1764).Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca Banks said in the draft: Although Th√©venot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus published in 1659.National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p.32; this map is reproduced in Gunter Schilder, Australia Unveiled, Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, p.402. image at: home See also Joan Blaeu, Nova et accvratissima totivs terrarvm orbis tabvla, 1667 It seems to have been Th√©venot who introduced a differentiation between Nova Hollandia to the west and Terre Australe to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135¬∞ East of Greenwich, emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map.Margaret Cameron Ash, \\"French Mischief: A Foxy Map of New Holland\\", The Globe, no.68, 2011, pp. 1‚Äì14.

So Flinders had concluded that the Terra Australis, as hypothesised by Aristotle and Ptolemy (which would be discovered as Antarctica less than six years later) did not exist; therefore he wanted the name applied to the continent of Australia, and it stuck. Flinders' book was widely read and gave the term \\"Australia\\" general currency. Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales, became aware of Flinders' preference for the name Australia and used it in his dispatches to England. On 12 December 1817, he recommended to the Colonial Office that it be officially adopted. In 1824 the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia.

Landmarks named after him in South Australia include the Flinders Ranges and Flinders Ranges National Park, Flinders Column at Mount Lofty, Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island, Flinders University, Flinders Medical Centre, the suburb Flinders Park and Flinders Street in Adelaide. In Victoria, eponymous places include Flinders Peak, Flinders Street in Melbourne, the suburb of Flinders, the federal electorate of Flinders, and the Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong. Flinders Bay in Western Australia and Flinders Way in Canberra also commemorate him. Educational institutions named after him include Flinders Park Primary School in South Australia, and Matthew Flinders Anglican College on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. A former electoral district of the Queensland Parliament was named Flinders. There are also Flinders Highways in both Queensland and South Australia. Bass and Flinders Point in Cronulla, New South Wales Bass & Flinders Point in the southernmost part of Cronulla in New South Wales features a monument to George Bass and Matthew Flinders, who explored the Port Hacking estuary. Australia holds a large collection of statues erected in Flinders' honour. In his native England, the first statue of Flinders was erected on 16 March 2006 (his birthday) in his hometown of Donington. The statue also depicts his beloved cat Trim, who accompanied him on his voyages. In July 2014, on the 200-year anniversary of his death, a large bronze statue of Flinders by the sculptor Mark Richards was unveiled at Australia House, London by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and later installed at Euston station near the presumed location of his grave. Flinders' proposalFlinders (1805) for the use of iron bars to be used to compensate for the magnetic deviations caused by iron on board a ship resulted in their being known as Flinders bars. Flinders coined the term \\"dodge tide\\" in reference to his observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincent's Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days, at select locations. Such phenomena have now also been found in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea.Once Again ‚Äì Tidal Friction, W. Munk, Qtly J. Ryl Astron Soc, Vol. 9, p. 352, 1968. Flinders, who was Sir John Franklin's cousin by marriage, John's mother Hannah being the sister of Matthew's step mother Elizabeth, instilled in him a love for navigating and took him with him on his voyage aboard Investigator. In 1964 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Postmaster-General's Department, again in 1980, and in 1998 with George Bass. Flindersia is a genus of 14 species of tree in the citrus family.

The island's residents celebrate Flinders Day annually, commemorating the landing. The celebrations are usually held on a weekend near 19 July, the actual date of the landing.

Combining elements of A New Hope and Return of the Jedi, in the game players pilot a Rebel starship and battle against the forces of the Empire. Sega developed Star Wars for their Model 1 system, the same arcade hardware that powered Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. Like those two titles, the graphics in Star Wars are rendered entirely using polygons, making it the first Star Wars game to feature fully 3-D polygonal graphics. The game was later released under the name Star Wars Arcade, as an exclusive for the Sega 32X's launch in 1994. The first in a series of Sega Star Wars arcade games, Sega followed up the release of Star Wars Arcade with several other arcade games - Star Wars Trilogy Arcade and Star Wars Racer Arcade, as well as a Star Wars pinball game. Gameplay Gameplay is similar to that of Atari's 1983 Star Wars arcade game. Players pilot an X-wing or a Y-wing in first or third person perspective and battle Imperial forces. The game has three levels which include intercepting TIE fighters in an asteroid field, destroying a Super Star Destroyer, and making an assault run on a Death Star. The arcade cabinet allows two people to play, with one serving as pilot and the other as gunner. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Star Wars Arcade in its June 15, 1994 issue as the sixth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the 32X version at 6.25/10, describing it as a decent but disappointing launch game for the console. They praised the excellent graphics but complained about repetitive gameplay and limited movement. GamePro similarly assessed that the game is a decent demonstration of the 32X's graphical capabilities but suffers from repetitive gameplay. They also criticized that the controls are convoluted when using a standard three- button gamepad and that in cooperative mode the second player's cursor is difficult to see against certain backgrounds. Next Generation rated the 32X version of the game at three stars out of five, calling it \\"An excellent translation of a good game, and a good hint of what to expect from 32X.\\" References External links Category:1993 video games Category:1994 video games Category:Action video games Category:Arcade games Category:Sega 32X games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega video games Category:Star Wars (film) video games Category:Star Wars arcade games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Star Wars Arcade"},{"id":"7722136","text":"White Mama is a 1980 American made-for-television drama film directed by Jackie Cooper and starring Bette Davis in the title role.

It is encoded by the CDKN2A gene. A deletion (the omission of a part of the DNA sequence during replication) in this gene can result in insufficient or non-functional p16, accelerating the cell cycle and resulting in many types of cancer. p16 can be used as a biomarker to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). p16 is also implicated in the prevention of melanoma, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer and esophageal cancer. p16 was discovered in 1993. It is a protein with 148 amino acids and a molecular weight of 16 kDa that comprises four ankyrin repeats. The name of p16 is derived from its molecular weight, and the alternative name p16INK4a refers to its role in inhibiting cyclin- dependent kinase CDK4. Nomenclature p16 is also known as: * p16INK4A * p16Ink4 * Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) * CDKN2 * CDK 4 Inhibitor * Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1 (MTS1) * TP16 * ARF * MLM * P14 * Gene In humans, p16 is encoded by the CDKN2A gene, located on chromosome 9 (9p21.3). This gene generates several transcript variants that differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4. The remaining transcript includes an alternate exon 1 located 20 kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein that is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. The ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53, as it can interact with and sequester MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53.\\"Molecular biology of cancer\\", Oxford University Press, 2005, , Section 5.3 In spite of their structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in controlling the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene. When organisms age, the expression of p16 increases to reduce the proliferation of stem cells. This reduction in the division and production of stem cells protects against cancer while increasing the risks associated with cellular senescence.  Function  p16 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). It slows down the cell cycle by prohibiting progression from G1 phase to S phase. Otherwise, CDK4/6 binds cyclin D and forms an active protein complex that phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Once phosphorylated, pRB dissociates from the transcription factor E2F1. This liberates E2F1 from its bound state in the cytoplasm and allows it to enter the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, E2F1 promotes the transcription of target genes that are essential for transition from G1 to S phase. This pathway connects the processes of tumor oncogenesis and senescence, fixing them on opposite ends of a spectrum. On one end, p16 hypermethylation, mutation, or deletion leads to downregulation of the gene and can lead to cancer through the dysregulation of cell cycle progression. Conversely, activation of p16 through reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, or senescence leads to the buildup of p16 in tissues and is implicated in the aging of cells. Regulation Regulation of p16 is complex and involves the interaction of several transcription factors, as well as several proteins involved in epigenetic modification through methylation and repression of the promoter region. PRC1 and PRC2 are two protein complexes that modify the expression of p16 through the interaction of various transcription factors that execute methylation patterns that can repress transcription of p16. These pathways are activated in the cellular response to reduce senescence. Clinical significance =Role in carcinogenesis= Mutations resulting in deletion or reduction of function of the CDKN2A gene are associated with increased risk of a wide range of cancers, and alterations of the gene are frequently seen in cancer cell lines. Examples include: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often associated with mutations in the CDKN2A gene. Carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A have, besides their high risks of melanoma, also increased risks of pancreatic, lung, laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers. Tobacco smoking increases the carriers‚Äô susceptibility for such non-melanoma cancers. Homozygous deletions of p16 are frequently found in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer cell lines. Germline mutations in CDKN2A are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop skin cancer. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in various cancers. In 2013, a meta-analysis revealed an increased frequency of DNA methylation of the p16 gene in esophageal cancer. As the degree of tumor differentiation increased, so did the frequency of p16 DNA methylation. Tissue samples of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) often display hypermethylation in the promoter regions of p16. Cancer cells show a significant increase in the accumulation of methylation in CpG islands in the promoter region of p16. This epigenetic change leads to loss of the tumor suppressor gene function through two possible mechanisms: first, methylation can physically inhibit the transcription of the gene, and second, methylation can lead to the recruitment of transcription factors that repress transcription. Both mechanisms cause the same end result: downregulation of gene expression that leads to decreased levels of the p16 protein. It has been suggested that this process is responsible for the development of various forms of cancer serving as an alternative process to gene deletion or mutation. p16 positivity has been shown to be favorably prognostic in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In a retrospective trial analysis of patients with Stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer, HPV status was assessed and it was found that the 3-year rates of overall survival were 82.4% (95% CI, 77.2 to 87.6) in the HPV-positive subgroup and 57.1% (95% CI, 48.1 to 66.1) in the HPV-negative subgroup, and the 3-year rates of progression-free survival were 73.7% (95% CI, 67.7 to 79.8) and 43.4% (95% CI, 34.4 to 52.4), respectively. p16 status is so prognostic that the AJCC staging system has been revised to include p16 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer group staging. p63 staining on Cervical cancer tissue using antibody clone IHC116 Clinical use =Biomarker for cancer types= Expression of p16 is used as a prognostic biomarker for certain types of cancer. The reason for this is different types of cancer can have different effects on p16 expression: cancers that overexpress p16 are usually caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), whereas cancers in which p16 is downregulated will usually have other causes. For patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, using immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of the p16 biomarker has been shown to be the strongest indicator of disease course. Presence of the biomarker is associated with a more favorable prognosis as measured by cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence- free survival (RFS), locoregional control (LRC), as well as other measurements. The appearance of hypermethylation of p16 is also being evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. =p16 FISH= p16 deletion detected by FISH in surface epithelial mesothelial proliferations is predictive of underlying invasive mesothelioma. =p16 immunochemistry= High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion showing strong p16 staining. As consensus grows regarding the strength of p16 as a biomarker for detecting and determining prognoses of cancer, p16 immunohistochemistry is growing in importance. gynecologic cancers p16 is a widely used immunohistochemical marker in gynecologic pathology. Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of p16 in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the female genital tract is strongly associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and neoplasms of cervical origin. The majority of SCCs of uterine cervix express p16. However, p16 can be expressed in other neoplasms and in several normal human tissues. =Urinary bladder SCCs= More than a third of urinary bladder SCCs express p16. SCCs of urinary bladder express p16 independent of gender. p16 immunohistochemical expression alone cannot be used to discriminate between SCCs arising from uterine cervix versus urinary bladder. =Role in cellular senescence= Concentrations of p16INK4a increase dramatically as tissue ages. p16INK4a, along with senescence- associated beta-galactosidase, is regarded to be a biomarker of cellular senescence. Therefore, p16INK4a could potentially be used as a blood test that measures how fast the body's tissues are aging at a molecular level. Notably, a recent survey of cellular senescence induced by multiple treatments to several cell lines does not identify p16 as belonging to a \\"core signature\\" of senescence markers. It has been used as a target to delay some aging changes in mice. =Role in neurogenesis= p16INK4a has been shown to prevent the depletion during aging of neural stem and progenitor cells in one of the neurogenic niche of the adult brain, i.e, the subventricular zone, which generates throughout life new neurons migrating to the olfactory bulb . Deletion of p16INK4a does not affect neurogenesis in the other adult neurogenic niche, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus . However, recently, it has been demonstrated that p16INK4a protects from depletion after a powerful proneurogenic stimulus - i.e., running - also stem and progenitor cells of the aged dentate gyrus . In fact, after deletion of p16INK4a, stem cells of the dentate gyrus are greatly activated by running, while, in wild-type p16INK4a dentate gyrus stem cells are not affected by running. Therefore, p16Ink4a plays a role in the maintenance of dentate gyrus stem cells after stimulus, by keeping a reserve of their self-renewal capacity during aging. Since the dentate gyrus plays a key role in spatial and contextual memory formation, p16INK4a is implicated in the maintenance of cognitive functions during aging. Discovery Researchers Manuel Serrano, Gregory J. Hannon and David Beach discovered p16 in 1993 and correctly characterized the protein as a cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor. Role in carcinogenesis Since its discovery, p16 has become significant in the field of cancer research. The protein was suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis due to the observation that mutation or deletion in the gene was implicated in human cancer cell lines. The detection of p16 inactivation in familial melanoma supplied further evidence. p16 deletion, mutation, hypermethylation, or overexpression is now associated with various cancers. Whether mutations in p16 can be considered to be driver mutations requires further investigation.  Interactions  p16 has been shown to interact with: * CCNG1, * CDK4, * CDK6, * DAXX, * E4F1, * MDM2, * P53, * PPP1R9B, * RPL11, and * SERTAD1.

Origin The name is said to have arisen from a branch of the ruling Ulaid dynasty of Mac Duinnshl√©ibhe (MacDonlevy) who had migrated to what is now County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland after John de Courcy's conquest of Ulaid in 1177. Here some of the MacDonlevys were nicknamed Ultagh/Ultach.Origin of the Surname, McNulty, and its Association with the McDonlevys/Dunleavys of County Down, Appendix 1, by Paul B. McNulty, Emeritus Professor, University College Dublin However, historical records such as the 1659 \\"Census\\" as well as Griffith's Valuation (1848-1864) show that concentrations of McNultys were found in parts of Ireland where the MacDonlevys had little presence, coupled with DNA analysis showing that the McNultys may actually derive from other Gaelic families that migrated from Ulaid and not just the MacDonlevy's. The names Ultagh/Ultach and Mac an Ultaigh applied to only those that fled Ulaid and was not used for those that remained. Regardless of their actual origin, the first McNulty to be recorded is found in the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1281, where an \\"Murtough Macan-Ulty\\" is listed as a distinguished fatality at the battle of Desertcreagh in present-day County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The probable transition of the name Mac an Ultaigh from the Ultagh MacDonlevy's can be seen around 1601 where one \\"Morris Ultagh\\" is recorded as \\"Morris m'Nich Ultagh\\".

He took the Liang throne under support from Western Wei after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed his uncle Emperor Yuan in 554, but many traditional historians, because he controlled little territory and relied heavily on military support by Western Wei and Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou, did not consider him and his successors true emperors of Liang. Instead, their state is traditionally considered separate, as Western Liang (or Later Liang). Early life Xiao Cha was born in 519, as the third son of Xiao Tong, then the crown prince to Liang Dynasty's founder Emperor Wu. His mother was Xiao Tong's concubine Consort Gong. He was considered studious, concentrating particularly on Buddhist sutras, and as Emperor Wu was a devout Buddhist, he was happy that his grandson studied sutras in this manner. When Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong's sons dukes sometime between 520 and 527, Xiao Cha was created the Duke of Qujiang. In 531, Xiao Tong died, but instead of creating Xiao Tong's oldest son Xiao Huan () the Duke of Huarong crown prince to succeed him (as was expected under Confucian principles of succession), Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong's younger brother Xiao Gang crown prince instead. However, he felt that he did not treat Xiao Tong's sons fairly, and therefore he created them princes‚Äîin Xiao Cha's case, the Prince of Yueyang‚Äîand gave them honors only slightly subordinate to their uncles. Because the capital commandery of Eastern Yang Province (Êù±ÊèöÂ∑û, modern central and eastern Zhejiang), Kuaiji Commandery (the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay), was the richest commandery of the entire empire, he rotated them as the governor of Eastern Yang Province, and Xiao Cha was thus rotated there sometime before 546. However, despite these special treatments, Xiao Cha was still angry that he and his brothers were passed over by Emperor Wu. He saw that Emperor Wu, late in his long reign (since 502), was ruling over an imperial regime that was becoming inefficient and beset by factionalism between Emperor Wu's sons, and therefore, when he was made the governor of Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern northwestern Hubei) in 546, he thought that this would be a good chance for him to establish a power base of his own, and therefore he cultivated the loyalty of the people to him by governing carefully. Struggles against Xiao Yi (Emperor Yuan) In 548, the general Hou Jing rebelled and attacked the capital Jiankang, capturing it in 549 and taking Emperor Wu and Crown Prince Gang hostage. (Emperor Wu died later that year and was succeeded by Crown Prince Gang (as Emperor Jianwen), albeit under Hou's control.) Meanwhile, also in 548, Emperor Wu had made Xiao Cha's older brother Xiao Yu () the Prince of Hedong the governor of Xiang Province (ÊπòÂ∑û, modern central Hunan), rotating the previous governor of Xiang Province, Zhang Zuan () to Yong Province. Zhang was a close friend of Emperor Wu's powerful son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, who was then the governor of the key Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern western and central Hubei), and he did not take Xiao Yu seriously, making Xiao Yu felt disrespected. Xiao Yu therefore detained Zhang and did not permit him to leave. Further, when Xiao Yi called for the provincial governors in his command region (which, inter alia, included both Xiang and Yong Provinces) to send troops to help lift the siege on Jiankang, Xiao Yu refused, and while Xiao Cha sent a detachment, he refused to command the detachment personally. When Zhang fled from Xiao Yu's custody late in 548, then, he went to Xiao Yi, and, bearing grudges against Xiao Yu, falsely accused Xiao Yu, Xiao Cha, and their cousin Xiao Cao () the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Xin Province (‰ø°Â∑û, modern eastern Chongqing) of conspiring against Xiao Yi. Xiao Yi therefore killed Xiao Cao and prepared an army to attack Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu was initially able to repel Xiao Yi's attack and cause Xiao Yi's heir apparent Xiao Fangdeng () to die in battle in summer 549, but by fall 549, he had been defeated by Xiao Yi's general Bao Quan (), who put Xiao Yu's headquarters at Changsha (Èï∑Ê≤ô, in modern Changsha, Hunan) under siege. Xiao Yu requested aid from Xiao Cha, and Xiao Cha commanded an army to attack Xiao Yi's headquarters at Jiangling. He put Jiangling under siege, but his attack was affected by heavy rains and repelled by Xiao Yi's general Wang Sengbian, and when his own general Du Ze () surrendered to Xiao Yi, and Du Ze's brother Du An () further launched a surprise attack on Xiao Cha's headquarters at Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Xiao Cha was forced to withdraw back to Xiangyang. Unable to help his brother and fearing that he would become Xiao Yi's next target‚Äîindeed, Xiao Yi then sent the general Liu Zhongli () to attack Xiao Cha‚ÄîXiao Cha submitted to Western Wei, offering to become a vassal, and sought aid, sending his wife Princess Wang and his heir apparent Xiao Liao () to Western Wei as hostages. Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of Western Wei, accepted Xiao Cha's submission and sent the general Yang Zhong () to aid Xiao Cha, and Yang defeated and captured Liu in spring 550. Yang subsequently entered into a treaty with Xiao Yi, putting Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Xiao Yi sacked Changsha and executed Xiao Yu in 550. In the summer of 550, Western Wei offered to declare Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang to inherit Emperor Wu's throne. Xiao Cha declined, but accepted the lesser title of Prince of Liang and also assumed acting imperial authority. Later that year, made a trip to the Western Wei capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wen of Western Wei and Yuwen. In spring 551, when his uncle Xiao Guan () the Prince of Shaoling was captured and killed by Western Wei troops commanded by Yang, Xiao Cha, who respected Xiao Guan, took his body and buried it with honors. In summer 551, when he heard that Hou was launching an attack on Xiao Yi's domain, he sent his general Cai Dabao () with an army heading toward Jiangling, claiming to be ready to render assistance, but after Xiao Yi sent a rebuking letter, he ordered Cai to withdraw. In 552, after defeating Hou, Xiao Yi declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan) and set his capital at Jiangling. Believing himself to be strong, he was arrogant in his dealings with Western Wei, drawing attention from Yuwen, who began to consider invading Liang. When Xiao Cha became aware of this, he paid additional tribute to Western Wei to try to fan the flame. Subsequently, in spring 553, when Emperor Yuan not only made the Western Wei envoy Yuwen Renshu () felt insulted by not treating him with as much respect as the envoy from Northern Qi, but further made demands to Yuwen Tai to return former Liang territory taken by Western Wei, Yuwen Tai decided to invade the Liang. In winter 553, Northern Zhou troops, commanded by Yu Jin (), arrived at Xiangyang, and Xiao Cha's forces joined them and continued to advance south toward Jiangling. Emperor Yuan was caught unprepared, and while he summoned his generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin to come to his aid, Emperor Yuan surrendered before they could arrive. Xiao Cha took the custody of Emperor Yuan, interrogating and insulting him heavily. Around the new year 555, with approval from Western Wei authorities, Xiao Cha put Emperor Yuan to death by suffocating him with a large bag full of dirt. He also executed Emperor Yuan's sons who were captured when Jiangling fell. Reign Western Wei created Xiao Cha Emperor of (Western) Liang, and he declared himself as such in spring 555 (as Emperor Xuan). Western Wei forces transferred Jiangling and the surrounding area to Emperor Xuan, but required him to transfer control of the Xiangyang region in exchange, and further left a military garrison at Jiangling, both to protect Emperor Xuan and to make sure that he would not rebel. Further, Western Wei troops pillaged Jiangling and took most of the inhabitants and the Liang imperial treasures back to Chang'an. While Western Wei troops under Yu were still at Jiangling, Emperor Xuan's subordinate Yin Deyi () suggested that he make a surprise attack on Yu and slaughter the Western Wei troops, then reassert Liang's independence. Emperor Xuan declined, reasoning that Western Wei had protected him greatly and that to turn against Western Wei would be unjust. He later regretted the decision, but the decision was probably a correct one as the other Liang generals showed no inclination of recognizing him as emperor. (As whether Emperor Xuan was a \\"legitimate\\" emperor of Liang was thereafter historically debated, his state is usually referred to by historians as either Western Liang or Later Liang.) Emperor Xuan posthumously honored his father Xiao Tong and Xiao Tong's wife Crown Princess Cai as emperor and empress, and honored his mother Consort Gong as empress dowager. He created his wife Princess Wang empress, and as his heir apparent Xiao Liao had died by this point, he created Xiao Liao's younger brother Xiao Kui as crown prince. He entrusted much of the governmental matters to Cai Dabao and Wang Cao (), both of whom served him faithfully. He appeared to have full expectation that he would be able to put additional Liang provinces under his control, but immediately, the Liang generals, including Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin, refused to recognize him. Wang Lin, who controlled modern Hunan and later parts of modern Hubei, indeed, sent his general Hou Ping () to attack Emperor Xuan, and while the attack was unsuccessful, Emperor Xuan was unable to expand his holdings. Later in 555, Wang Sengbian declared Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming emperor. In fall 555, after Wang Sengbian was killed by his lieutenant Chen Baxian, Chen deposed Xiao Yuanming and declared Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing). After Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him in 558, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu, Wang Lin declared Emperor Yuan's grandson Xiao Zhuang emperor, thus maintaining a competing claim for the Liang throne. In late 558, with Wang Lin having advanced east to try to attack Chen, Emperor Xuan sent Wang Cao to try to seize the commanderies forming modern Hunan from Xiao Zhuang's domain, although the scope of success for this action was unclear. In any case, however, when Hou Tian (), a general of Chen Baxian's nephew Emperor Wen of Chen defeated Wang Lin in spring 560, a combination of Emperor Xuan's and Northern Zhou troops were able to take the western half of Xiao Zhuang's territory, and Emperor Xuan assumed control over that territory, albeit requiring Northern Zhou military support. In fall 560, Hou Tian continued his advance, intending to take Xiang Province from Emperor Xuan. Northern Zhou generals Heruo Dun () and Dugu Sheng () led their troops against Hou, and Chen and Northern Zhou troops soon stalemated, and while initially, Hou was unable to make much progress against Heruo and Dugu, soon, problems with food supplies and illnesses caused Northern Zhou troops to be worn down. Around the new year 561, Dugu was forced to withdraw, putting Heruo under even greater pressure. By spring 561, Yin Liang (), who was defending Changsha, surrendered to Chen. Hou Tian then proposed to Heruo to let him withdraw peacefully. Heruo agreed and withdrew, and all of the territory previously taken from Xiao Zhuang were now in Chen hands, limiting Emperor Xuan's domain to the Jiangling region again. Emperor Xuan, depressed that his territory was small and heavily damaged by warfare, soon began to suffer from a serious skin lesion on his back. He died in spring 562. Xiao Kui succeeded him (as Emperor Ming). The historian Li Yanshou (), in his History of Northern Dynasties, had this to say about Emperor Xuan, both praising him and noting some of his idiosyncricies: :Xiao Cha had great ambitions from his youth, and he was not bogged down with details. Although he often suspected others, he was gracious to his soldiers and received their loyalty. He did not drink and was content with frugal living. He served his mother with great filial piety, and did not preoccupy himself with feasting. He particularly disliked women, and even when they were several steps away from him, he would state that he could smell them. Any clothes he wore while having sexual contact with women would be discarded thereafter. After having sexual intercourse with a consort, he would have to take a day to recuperate. He also disliked seeing human hair, and his servants had to either wear turbans or hats so that their hairs would not be exposed.

He was the nephew of the founding emperor Emperor Wu. In 555, with Liang in disarray after Western Wei had captured and killed Emperor Yuan, Northern Qi, which had held Xiao Yuanming as an honored captive since 547, forced the general Wang Sengbian to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor. Soon, however, Wang's subordinate Chen Baxian killed Wang and removed Xiao Yuanming from the throne, replacing him with Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi (Emperor Jing). Xiao Yuanming died the following year. Early life It is not known when Xiao Yuanming was born. His father Xiao Yi (Ëï≠Êáø) was a major general during late Southern Qi, and of Xiao Yi's sons, five (perhaps all) are known to history. Xiao Yuanming was the youngest among these sons. As Xiao Yi was forced to commit suicide by Southern Qi's cruel emperor Xiao Baojuan in 500, Xiao Yuanming could not have been born any later than 501. After Xiao Yi's death, Xiao Yi's younger brother and Xiao Yuanming's uncle Xiao Yan rebelled at his post of Xiangyang, seeking to avenge Xiao Yi. By 502 he put the capital Jiankang under siege, and Xiao Baojuan was killed by his own generals. Later that year, Xiao Yan seized the throne from Xiao Baojuan's younger brother Emperor He of Southern Qi, ending Southern Qi and establishing Liang Dynasty (as Emperor Wu). Emperor Wu was said to love Xiao Yuanming greatly, and he created Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang. Career as Liang official Nothing is known about Xiao Yuanming's career as an official until 547, when it was recorded that he was the governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, modern central Anhui). The people were said to be so impressed by his governance that they made a stone monument commemorating his term of office. However, it became known later that the artisans who carved the monument were associated with and paid by Xiao Yuanming. Therefore, it became widely believed that he had encouraged the people to create the monument to praise himself. In 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, in conflict with the regent Gao Cheng, surrendered his domain‚Äî13 provinces between the Yellow River and the Huai River‚Äîto Liang. Emperor Wu accepted Hou's surrender and commissioned an army to aid Hou, to be commanded by Emperor Wu's grandson Xiao Huili (Ëï≠ÊúÉÁêÜ) the Prince of Nankang. Xiao Yuanming requested to accompany Xiao Huili, and was made Xiao Huili's assistant. However, Xiao Huili was cowardly and arrogant, and he refused to meet his subordinate generals, even Xiao Yuanming. Xiao Yuanming secretly informed Emperor Wu of this, and Emperor Wu relieved Xiao Huili of his command and put Xiao Yuanming in command. The Liang army, commanded by Xiao Yuanming, advanced on the Eastern Wei city Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and Xiao Yuanming camped at Hanshan (ÂØíÂ±±), in Pengcheng's vicinity, and built a dam over Si River (Ê≥óÊ∞¥) to use water to attack Pengcheng. Xiao Yuanming's lieutenant, the general Yang Kan (Áæä‰æÉ), quickly completed the dam, but when Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack Pengcheng, Xiao Yuanming hesitated. Because Xiao Yuanming could not come up with a coordinated strategy, the generals under him began to carry out their own actions, including pillaging the people in the region, and Xiao Yuanming was unable to stop them, save the units directly under his own command. Late in 547, the Eastern Wei forces commanded by Murong Shaozong (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ¥πÂÆó) arrived, and instead of engaging the Eastern Wei forces quickly as Yang suggested, Xiao Yuanming became drunk with wine and allowed Murong's army to settle in. When the armies did engage, the Liang forces were initially successful, but Murong's counterattack caused Liang forces to collapse, and Xiao Yuanming was captured. However, the people of the region was impressed by his refusal to pillage them, and gave him the epithet \\"the righteous prince\\" (Áæ©Áéã, yi wang). He was taken to the Eastern Wei capital Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei), where Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei formally received and rebuked him, and then released him, sending him to Gao Cheng's headquarters at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), where Gao treated him with honor‚Äîintending to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn in negotiations with Liang. Subsequently, Gao allowed Xiao Yuanming to write to Emperor Wu and offered to return Xiao Yuanming‚Äîcausing Hou, who had by that point lost the 13 provinces but controlled Yu Province, to rebel in 548, capturing Jiankang in 549, taking Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang hostages, and throwing Liang into a general state of confusion and unrest. Return to Liang Little is known about Xiao Yuanming's activities while in Eastern Wei and its successor state Northern Qi (as Gao Cheng's successor and brother Gao Yang seized the throne from Emperor Xiaojing in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan), although it was said that Xiao Yuanming cried bitterly when he heard about the fall of Jiankang. He was given the office of sanqi changshi (Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç) -- an honorific office with little responsibilities. In 552, Emperor Wu's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong defeated Hou and declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan), setting his capital at Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) rather than the war- devastated Jiankang, but in 554, Western Wei forces captured Jiangling, capturing and then executing Emperor Yuan. In light of Emperor Yuan's death, his most important general Wang Sengbian and Wang's lieutenant Chen Baxian, who together controlled the eastern empire, welcomed Emperor Yuan's 12-year- old son Xiao Fangzhi to Jiankang, preparing to make him emperor, and in spring 555, Xiao Fangzhi took the title Prince of Liang. At that time, however, Emperor Wenxuan, who had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to establish Xiao Yuanming's cousin Xiao Tui (Ëï≠ÈÄÄ) as Liang's emperor in 553, decided to again try to establish a vassal regime in Liang. He wrote Wang, suggesting that Xiao Fangzhi was too young to be emperor and proposing Xiao Yuanming as emperor‚Äîand Xiao Yuanming apparently cooperated with Emperor Wenxuan in this attempt, as he wrote a letter to Wang as well. Wang initially wrote back to reject the offer. However, a few quick victories by Northern Qi escort forces, commanded by Emperor Wenxuan's brother Gao Huan (È´òÊ∏ô) the Prince of Shangdang, made Wang fearful, and he wrote back, agreeing to support Xiao Yuanming as emperor‚Äîbut extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to create Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang also allowedly only 1,000 soldiers to accompany Xiao Yuanming south of the Yangtze River. In summer 555, Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang, and as he saw the main gate to the palace‚ÄîZhuque Gate (Êú±ÈõÄÈñÄ), he cried bitterly, and the Liang officials also cried bitterly. He then took the throne. Pursuant to his promise, he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang and Chen continued to be in command of the armed forces. Reign Xiao Yuanming's reign did not last long. In fall 555, Chen Baxian, displeased with Xiao Yuanming's ascension‚Äîwhich he had tried to persuade Wang Sengbian not to accept‚Äîmade a surprise attack on Jiankang from his post at Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). With everyone believing that Chen's army movement was in response to report that Northern Qi was planning to attack, Jiankang's defense forces made no effort to resist, and Chen surprised Wang, killing him and seizing power. Two days after Wang's death, Xiao Yuanming abdicated and moved out of the palace, returning to his private residence. Chen made Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing). After abdication Emperor Jing formally made Xiao Yuanming prime minister and created him the greater title of Duke of Jian'an, although there is no evidence that Xiao Yuanming yielded much actual power. In light of the coup, Northern Qi launched a major attack on Liang in winter 555, aided by Liang generals loyal to Wang Sengbian. The Northern Qi and Liang armies following Chen Baxian's orders stalemated for months. In summer 556, Northern Qi generals invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp for peace negotiations, and Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to the Northern Qi camp. However, before any negotiations could commence, Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back. In 558, Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia (Emperor Yuan's grandson), who was proclaimed Liang's emperor by the general Wang Lin following Chen's seizure of the throne from Emperor Jing earlier that year, honored Xiao Yuanming as Emperor Min‚Äîa posthumous name recognized by but rarely used by traditional historians.

The school made news in 1998 when tensions between white, Afrikaans-speaking students and black students who were taught in English led to violence including alleged hostage-taking, beatings of students, and riots. However, today Vryburg High School maintains a safe environment and performs exceptionally well in areas such as sports, culture, and produces some of the best academic results in the North West Province.  History  The Stellaland Republic was founded in 1882. At that stage there was no formal education on a large scale mainly due to the small number of inhabitants and a lack of funds but on the other hand also because the basic skills (reading and writing) could be learned at home. In 1883, however, two private schools were founded by miss Dedman and miss Kennedy. The Vryburg community and the imperial government (British Bechuanaland) merged and eventually, on February 2, 1891, the Vryburg Public School came into being with an enrollment of 20 students. Mr Kelly was initially appointed as acting principal, but was permanently appointed in 1893. By 1901, enrollment had increased to 200 students. However, there was another school that was established in 1883, the so-called Poor School, which was established by the local Dutch Reformed Church for needy children. The Vryburg Public School came under the authority of the Cape Colony in 1895 when the British Bechuanaland was incorporated into the Cape Colony. The Poor School was then incorporated into the Public School. After the War of Independence, there were two more schools in the Vryburg area; the monastery school as well as a school in the concentration camp. The local NG minister also founded the \\"Independent School\\" because there were many different language groups. So there were then five different schools in Vryburg. All the schools merged in 1909 to form one school. In 1913, H. Rosenblatt laid the cornerstone of the new school. However, the new school was initially quite small and in 1925 the Education Department budgeted to rebuild new school buildings. The former Minister of Education, Dr DF Malan, laid the cornerstone of the current school building in 1928. Stellaland Primary School (now Vryburg Primary School) was formed in 1940 through the separation of the primary school from the high school due to an overwhelming number of pupils which was then 717. During 1948 the school was enlarged by the addition of a new science laboratory, a library and a classroom; at the same time, the woodworking and household classrooms were equipped. The number pupils exceeded the 600 notch in 1960 and the school was further enlarged. In 1980 the building plans for further extensions were approved and in 1987 the new building complex was officially received by the Department and opened by S. W. Walters, Director of Education. The expansion included a fully equipped technical section with 3 workshops for automotive, electrician and fitting and turning, 17 classrooms, 3 laboratories, 1 household classroom, 6 administrative offices, an enlarged hall, a medical inspection unit, several packing rooms and bathrooms.  Sports  The school has a strong sporting reputation and also has access to the excellent grounds which include rugby, hockey, and soccer pitches as well as netball and tennis courts at the Gert Lubbe sports grounds.  Boarding houses  On September 7, 1967, Dr Nico Malan, then the Administrator of the Cape, opened the current residence buildings. The two current residence buildings were not easy to obtain. The matter was even quoted in the Provincial Council where it was granted after a number of representations. Mr J.P. (Hannes) du Toit, former Provincial Councillor, worked particularly hard for the acquisition of the two residences during his term. The girl's residence was therefore named after him: House Hannes du Toit. Dr Nico Malan was the former Administrator of the Cape who gave the final approval for the buildings. The boy's residence, House Nico Malan, was named after him.

He became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan, New York City from 1935 to 1950.  Early life  Born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Johnson was the son of James Johnson and the former Margaret Jane Brown. The young tenor sang in his local church choir and at events in the Guelph area. At a concert in Stratford, Ontario in 1897, contralto Edith Miller encouraged him to move to New York and pursue a singing career. He sang as a soloist with several church choirs in the New York area. After this period he did much concert work, touring through the Mid-West with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and singing in many Music Festivals throughout the country.Harriette Brower (1917) Vocal Mastery: Talks with Master Singers and Teachers After a peripatetic existence for some years, working in a variety of venues and training with several masters, he made his concert debut at Carnegie Hall in 1904. Johnson sang the lead role in the North American premiere of Oscar Straus's A Waltz Dream in 1907. In 1908 he moved to Paris, France and began training under Richard Barth√©lemy. He married Beatrice d'Arneiro, in London, in August 1909. His only child, Fiorenza, was born 21 December 1910. She married George Drew who later became Premier of Ontario and Federal Leader of the Opposition, and died in 1965.  Opera career Edward Johnson Johnson went to Italy in 1909, studying voice with Vincenzo Lombardi, in Florence. When singing outside North America, Johnson called himself Edoardo Di Giovanni. He made his opera debut on 10 January 1912 as Andrea Ch√©nier at Padua's Teatro Verdi. After his d√©but in Padua, he became leading tenor at La Scala, Milan, for five consecutive seasons. In Rome he spent four seasons at the Costanzi Theatre, where, among other roles, he sang Luigi and Rinuccio in the Italian premiere of Il trittico. In 1914 he sang the title role in the first performance in Italian of Richard Wagner's Parsifal, under the baton of Arturo Toscanini.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom ed. He sang in Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires. His London debut was in Gounod's Faust, alongside Nellie Melba. Johnson made his North American opera debut on 20 November 1919 as Loris in Giordano's Fedora with the Chicago Opera. He remained in Chicago for three years. Johnson made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 16 November 1922, as Avito in Italo Montemezzi's L'amore dei tre re. He remained with the Met for thirteen years as a singer. He notably created the title role in the world premiere of Deems Taylor's The King's Henchman in 1927. His last performance was on 20 March 1935.  As an opera director  In May 1935, Johnson became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, succeeding Herbert Witherspoon, who died just six weeks into his tenure. Johnson held the position for fifteen years.  Retirement  Johnson retired from the Met on 15 June 1950 and was succeeded by Rudolf Bing. He returned to Guelph, promoting musical education and serving as chairman of the board of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He established the Edward Johnson Music Foundation, sponsor of the annual Guelph Spring Festival. He suffered a heart attack and died while attending a National Ballet recital at the Guelph Memorial Gardens. Thoughts on singing *Not many rules > \\"If you get right down to the bottom, there are in reality not so many > singing rules to learn. You sing on the five vowels, and when you can do > them loudly, softly, and with mezzo voce, you have a foundation upon which > to build vocal mastery. And yet some people study eight, ten years without > really laying the foundation. Why should it take the singer such a long time > to master the material of his equipment? A lawyer or doctor, after leaving > college, devotes three or four years only to preparing himself for his > profession, receives his diploma, then sets up in business. It ought not to > be so much more difficult to learn to sing than to learn these other > professions.\\" Edward Johnson *The ear > \\"Of course the ear is the most important factor, our greatest ally. It helps > us imitate. Imitation forms a large part of our study. We hear a beautiful > tone; we try to imitate it; we try in various ways, with various placements, > until we succeed in producing the sound we have been seeking. Then we > endeavor to remember the sensations experienced in order that we may repeat > the tone at will. So you see Listening, Imitation and Memory are very > important factors in the student's development.\\" Edward Johnson *Bel canto > \\"The old Italian operas cultivate the bel canto, that is‚Äîbeautiful singing. > Of course it is well for the singer to cultivate this first of all, for it > is excellent, and necessary for the voice. But modern Italian opera portrays > the real men and women of to-day, who live, enjoy, suffer, are angry and > repentant. Bel canto will not express these emotions. When a man is jealous > or in a rage, he will not stand quietly in the middle of the stage and sing > beautiful tones.\\" Edward Johnson *Interpretation > \\"I feel that if I have worked out a characterization, I must stick to my > idea, in spite of what others say. It is my own conception, and I must > either stand or fall by it. At times I have tried to follow the suggestions > of this or that critic and have changed my interpretation to suit their > taste.

The sacred barques of the wind deity Amun-Re, his consort Mut and son Khonsu left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased royalty on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis. Celebration The Beautiful Festival of the Valley, or heb nefer en inet in Egyptian, was a celebration of the dead. It could be more ancient than the Opet Festival as it can be traced back to the Middle Kingdom. It was said to be held as a remembrance of the dead, from the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. However, when joined with the Festival of Opet, the holy procession became the main event of the liturgical calendar of Thebes. The annual festival was held at the New Moon of Month Two. This was the summer season, shemu, and the 10th month in a calendar of 12. During Hatshepsut's reign she carried out both the Opet and The Beautiful Festival of the Valley to Amun. There was a grand procession at the start of the festival which could go for several days. It was a colourful and joyous occasion for the people of Thebes. The procession would be led by Amun, from the East (rising sun, new life, the direction of the living) to the West (setting sun, land of the dead.) A statue or picture of Amun, decorated with a broad collar and sun disk, would be led by priests down the Nile in a ceremonial boat or barque. This barque would then be placed in a ship known as the Userhet that was covered in gold and precious materials. This Userhet would be followed by boats for Mut and Khonsu to form the Theban Triad. The procession proceeded to the Temple of Million Years of the King where the townspeople would sacrifice food and drink as well as flowers to the flotilla of boats. Great quantities of flowers would be presented, as it is believed by the Egyptian culture that the flowers became filled with the essence of the deity. Townspeople then took these flowers to their relatives' tombs to pay their respects and ensure the revival of the deceased's spirit. They would drink and sleep on the deceased's tombs as different levels of consciousness blessed the dead and brought them closer to god. Amun's shrine was brought into the Djoser-djoseru to reaffirm the bond between the king of the gods and the king of the people. References * Davies, V. & Friedman R.

He was born in Hurstville, NSW, Australia on 29 December 1921. Career From 1942 to 1945 Aitchison worked as an engineer with the Amalgamated Wireless Valve Company on the design and production of klystrons and radar magnetrons, which were new devices important to the war effort. He was also involved in work on semiconductor diodes, which were the forerunners of the revolution in electronics brought about by the advent of solid-state semiconductor components. In 1945 he joined the National Acoustic Laboratories where he worked on the design and construction of hearing aids for children. Aitchison was appointed as senior lecturer in Communications Engineering at the University of Sydney, which was the start of his 25-year teaching experience at that institution, culminating in his appointment as associate professor. His interest in solid-state physics took him to Bristol University, UK, for a year, and he also spent a year at Stanford University, California, on a Fulbright scholarship, working at the forefront of electronics research. In 1970, he accepted an offer from Macquarie University to become the founding professor of electronics and took up the post in 1971. Macquarie University At Macquarie, Aitchison was hired as foundation professor of electronics. He taught this subject, with an emphasis on semiconductor physics, to advanced undergraduates and graduate students. In his teachings he emphasized understanding of principles over memorization of facts. As a researcher, he created a state-of-the-art electronics laboratory and led several successful projects of a highly practical nature including pioneering work on the reception of satellite weather pictures that were shown every evening in Sydney's TV newscasts. In addition, he served as Head of the School of Mathematics and Physics, and as a member of Macquarie's Academic Senate.Macquarie University Calendar (Macquarie University, North Ryde, 1979). At the School of Mathematics and Physics, Aitchison became a colleague and friend of quantum physicist John Clive Ward and he was a supporter, and active participant, of the Macquarie science reform movement.J.

He retired 4 July 1986.Macquarie University Calendar (Macquarie University, North Ryde, 1987). Achievements * The scientific calculator with speech output for blind students. Aitchison's passion in his later years at Macquarie University was the development of the Speakwriter, a typewriter which enunciated the sounds of typewriter keys as they were pressed. An article written by Tony Healy in Computing Australia (1/9/86) quotes Tim Connell now working for Quantum Technology: ‚ÄúWe saw Professor Aitchison on TV with his (talking) typewriter and realised we could do that.‚Äù Aitchison developed the talking typewriter originally to help a blind student complete a standard science course. His ideas can now be seen in many of the products available today made for people with vision impairment. * The completion of the design, construction and commissioning of an orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite for remote sensing. * The development of solid-state pulse modulators for driving hydrogen thyratrons and for replacing hydrogen thyratrons in pulsed lasers, such as high-power copper vapor lasers. As a result of his work in these fields and his forty years teaching experience, he was awarded the status of Emeritus Professor of Electronics. * Aitchison was a fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics, a fellow of the Institute of Physics (London), and a fellow of the IREE.Macquarie University Calendar (Macquarie University, North Ryde, 1983).

Bey (born Jesse Davis; February 4, 1942 ‚Äì June 1, 2012) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer from Detroit, Michigan. Bey was known for his work with Griot Galaxy, which played distinct compositions, often by Bey. Odd meters and polyrhythms were a frequent feature of the group's tunes, which would give way to free sections. Originally started in 1972, Griot Galaxy settled into its most stable line-up around 1980, when Bey was joined by saxophonists David McMurray and Anthony Holland, as well as bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal. Griot Galaxy played at the 1983 Detroit Montreux Jazz Festival (now the Detroit Jazz Festival), and toured Europe in the mid-1980s. In the mid-1980s Bey was in a serious motorcycle accident that left him in a coma. Almost a decade passed before he returned to performing. He re-emerged with an all woodwind ensemble called The Conspiracy Winds Ensemble. He began to play in Speaking in Tongues and Hakim Jami's Street Band. He joined forces with The Northwoods Improvisers, who devoted several releases to Bey's music. His frequent collaborators, saxophonists Michael Carey and Skeeter Shelton, joined him on most of the Northwoods Improviser's recordings. He also played in Kindred, a quartet with Kennith Green, Kevin Callaway and Joel Peterson, and in Odu Afrobeat Orchestra. Among Bey's last ensembles was The Absolute Tonalist Society with Carey, Peterson and drummer Kurt Prisbe. Some of his most noted releases are Kins, Opus Krampus and Live at the DIA with Griot Galaxy, and Auzar and Ashirai Pattern with The Northwoods Improvisers. Bey published two books of poetry, Year of the Iron Sheep and Etudes in Wanton Nesses, in addition to a theoretical/aesthetic manifesto Toward a \\"Ratio\\"nal Aesthetic (1989). Bey died on June 1, 2012. He had experienced long-term health issues including emphysema. Discography With Griot Galaxy *Kins (Black & White, 1982) *Live at the D.I.A.

The takahƒì was widely thought to be extinct but Orbell suspected it might survive. While taking time off from his Invercargill practice to search for the takahƒì, he discovered a set of unfamiliar footprints and heard a strange bird call. After following the footprints with three companions, he rediscovered three of the species on 20 November 1948 in a remote valley of the Murchison Mountains near Lake Te Anau. A lake in the valley was named Lake Orbell in his honour. Orbell was one of the founders of the New Zealand Deerstalkers' Association and was its first president, holding the position from 1938 to 1952. In the 1953 Coronation Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for scientific work. He retired from medical practice at the age of 70, and in later years lived in Mosgiel, near Dunedin. Orbell died on 14 August 2007.

Traditionally served in the morning with salt, onion, chili and bengali style mashed potatoes or \\"Aloo sheddho\\" (simple boilled potatoes mashed and salted without adding any cream or cheese). It is consumed in eastern Indian states of Bihar, Odisha , West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and in neighbouring country Bangladesh. It is a popular dish on the day of Pahela Baishakh or Bengali new year. It has been described in documents from 17th century. Panta bhat has more micronutrients than fresh rice. It is traditionally considered as beneficial in feverish conditions. History Anthropologist Tapan Kumar Sanyal, argues that proto-Australoid people of South Asia resorted the panta bhat because they cooked once a day, in the evening.Tapan Kumar Sanyal, 'And Keeping the Flame Alive: A Study on Food Habits and Dietaries with Nutritional Efficiency of West Bengal Tribes, pages 104-105, Cultural Research Institute, Scheduled Castes and Tribes Welfare Department, Government of West Bengal, 1979 During the Mughal Era, members of socio-cultural organizations performed open air concerts, the audience listening to the concert and eating traditional food, particularly panta bhat. Friar Sebastian Manrique reported from his visit of Bengal in 17th century that the people of all communities, according to Manrique, were contented then with the daily meal of rice, often panta bhat, salt and green vegetable (shak). The better-off elements of the society consumed ghee, butter, milk and various lacteous preparations and sweetmeats. Rice researcher Mahabub Hossain of International Rice Research Institute explains that in the past, people engaged in farm work preferred bold and brown rice which is more suited for watered rice, and also provides more nutrition. But, as more people shifted to urban centers the demand for farm work, brown rice and watered rice decreased. In these times of polished rice, the popularity of rice varieties like Lal Swarna and White Swarna is often driven by their suitability for panta bhat.Mahabub Hossain, Adoption and Diffusion of Modern Rice Varieties in Bangladesh and Eastern India, pages 37, 52, 98, International Rice Research Institute, 2012, Preparation There are many variations of the dish though all are made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3‚Äì4 hours. Then cool water is added in a way that about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12‚Äì24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Panta bhat retains its taste for 2/3 days. The fluid portion is called amani or torani, and may be specially prepared. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination. The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor.Akhter Hameed Khan, The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan (Volume 1), page 288, Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development, 1983Debates: official report (Volume 2, Issues 16-30), page 1092, Pakistan. National Assembly, 1966 Panta bhat is often served with fried fish or vegetable curry or flattened rice (chira), dried cane or palm molasses (jaggery or gurh) and milk curd (doi). Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added.Narendra S. Bisht and T. S. Bankoti, Encyclopaedic Ethnography of the Himalayan Tribes: R-Z (Volume 4), Page 1336, Global Vision, 2004, Panta bhat or poita bhat is often garnished with mustard oil, onion, chilli, pickle, and served with shutki mach (dried fish), machher jhol (fish curry), especially shorshe Ilish (ilish cooked with mustard seeds), aloo bhorta or aloo pitika (mashed potato), begun bhorta (mashed brinjal) and other bhorta or pitika (mashed food). A similar dish consumed in the Indian states of Bihar as Maar Bhaat, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh is known as Pakhala (also pakhal], pokhalo or pakhal bhat). It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process.Panta bhat ‚Äì A Forgotten Recipe, The Great Indian Taste Pazhedhu saadham, meaning \\"old rice\\", of Tamil Nadu is another variation of the dish.Nandita Iyer,Not fresh, yet healthy, Live Mint, May 12, 2014 It is consumed in East and South East Asia as well, and is known as Jiuniang in China.

According to Madhumita Barooah, one of the researchers, \\"About 100 gm of cooked rice has only 3.4 mg of iron, while for the same quantity of rice fermented for 12 hours, the iron content went up to 73.91 mg. Likewise, sodium, which was 475 mg came down to 303 mg, potassium went up to 839 mg and calcium went up from 21 mg per 100 gm of cooked rice to 850 mg, after 12 hours of fermentation of the same quantity of rice.\\" According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic acid hydrolysis, and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B.Marie T. Ruel, Can Food- Based Strategies Help Reduce Vitamin A and Iron Deficiencies? , International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C., December 2001 Panta bhat has some remedial use. It is considered as a \\"cold food\\" by Ayurveda traditions, while boiled rice is neutral. Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever.Clarence Maloney, K. M. Ashraful Aziz and Profulla Chandra Sarker, Beliefs and Fertility in Bangladesh, page 131, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, 1981 Panta bhat also contains a small amount of alcohol as a result of fermentation. When the conditions of preparing panta bhat ‚Äî keeping rice soaked overnight in water ‚Äî were simulated in the laboratory, the rice was found to be inoculated with veratridine, a steroid-derived alkaloid.Hans Riemann, Food-borne Infections and Intoxications, page 266, Academic Press, 1969 Despite its nutritional and remedial values, panta bhat is often contaminated, with almost 90% of the samples containing fecal coliforms with a median count of 3.9 log cfu/ml. The contamination was more in the rainy season. Numbers of fecal coliforms increased 10-fold when there was a delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption; 90% of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation. Contamination increased during the rainy season. A ten-fold increase in contamination was observed between 4 hours of soaking and 16 hours of soaking.Kristy M Hendricks and Salma H Badruddin, Weaning and Diarrhoeal Disease, Journal of Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, page 8, ICDDR, B, Mar 1994 In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient,India Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Indian Market Research Bureau, UNICEF & United States Agency for International Development, Diarrhoea in Rural India: A Nationwide Study of Mothers and Practitioners, page 54, Vision Books, 1990 though boiled rice and rice-water are often prescribed as diarrheal treatment.H.

Weasel is a friend, sidekick, information broker and arms dealer for Deadpool. Weasel is perhaps Deadpool's best friend. However, because of his frequent mood swings and tenuous mental state, Deadpool still often abuses or mistreats him. Weasel has also displayed an opportunistic streak against his friend's interests on occasions. Publication history Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Klaus Janson, Weasel first appeared in Cable #3 (July 1993). Fictional character biography Weasel was once a bright young lad attending Empire State University, where he was a classmate of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Weasel, then known by his birth name of Jack Hammer, was competing with Parker for a prestigious job under the wing of Norman Osborn and held an enormous crush on Stacy, Parker's future girlfriend. Deadpool accidentally teleported into the past during a fight with the Great Lakes Avengers. In the past, he found Jack Hammer whose future he was well aware of. Disguised as Peter Parker, Deadpool related to Norman Osborn false information about Jack Hammer being a drug user. His employment opportunity thus ruined, Hammer was manipulated by the disguised Deadpool into fixing his teleportation belt. With the gadget fixed, Deadpool returns to the future, leaving a depressed and drunken young Hammer with a new career option: crime.Deadpool #11. Marvel Comics. From that point on, Hammer adopted the name of Weasel and turned to a life consisting of providing intelligence, weapons and other technological devices to mercenaries and criminals, sometimes partaking in mercenary activities himself. It is during this period that Weasel (from his perspective) first met Deadpool in Canada, apparently meeting not long after Deadpool left Weapon X.Deadpool #2. Marvel Comics. Weasel quickly proved himself as an able informant and arms supplier to Deadpool and eventually came to form an uneasy friendship with him. He assisted his friend behind the scenes as Deadpool eventually came to work for a crime lord named Tolliver. After Tolliver's apparent death, the two competed against a slew of other mercenaries, villains, heroes and assassins to become the beneficiaries of Tolliver's will,Deadpool: The Circle Chase #1-4. Marvel Comics. and later came to work at the Hellhouse,Deadpool #1. Marvel Comics. a hotbed of mercenary activity in Chicago where jobs were dispensed to those willing to take them. Deadpool, due to his prowess and cold heart, came to be feared and respected there, but often butted heads with another powerful mercenary, T-Ray. During this time, The Taskmaster abducted Weasel in order to procure his services. Initially allowing Deadpool to track him down, then switching off his tracking device (which was attuned to his heart) shortly before Taskmaster defeated Deadpool, Weasel revealed his confusion to both mercenaries due to Taskmaster's sweetened offer in spite of the somewhat mercurial loyalties shared between himself and Deadpool. However, when his friend baffled and conclusively defeated Taskmaster, he chose to return to his employ, encouraged in part by Deadpool's show of compassion for him and the promise of a new cable connection to the Playboy Channel. Weasel tried to mention Siryn, knowing the positive influence the Irish mutant had over Deadpool. Once again he was cowed by threats of physical violence.Deadpool #3. Marvel Comics. His loyalties to Deadpool were also further shown at the Hellhouse when it became apparent that T-Ray maintained a grip of intimidation over the other mercenaries when Deadpool was absent, even though he was in no position to stand up to T-Ray directly.Deadpool #5. Marvel Comics. Ultimately, T-Ray decided to organize a showdown with Deadpool and told Weasel to relay that information to Deadpool.Deadpool #7. Marvel Comics. In an effort to get in touch with his friend before the appointed showdown time, Weasel teleported to Deadpool's San Francisco home - a definite no-no. He was shooed out by Deadpool's friend/prisoner Blind Al, but when Weasel later made repeated visits to her, Deadpool discovered him there and placed both him and Blind Al in the Box, a dark room so filled with sharp objects and instruments of torture that movement is almost impossible. This latest abuse was the breaking point - Weasel decided to move on and left Deadpool after escaping from the Box, hoping to define his life outside of his association with Deadpool. Fate had other designs, however. After Deadpool's death and subsequent resurrection some time afterward, Weasel ran into an amnesiac Deadpool. He helped to restore Deadpool's memory and thus restored their friendship before leaving once more. An on-again off-again association between the two occurred after this point, with Deadpool sometimes asking for goods or working with Weasel. However, another breaking point came when Deadpool stood up for Weasel when he was found hacking into a computer. When Deadpool found out that Weasel had lied, he refused to help Weasel, who was sent to jail. Weasel decided to atone for this crime by faithfully serving his time, and when he got out, coincidentally worked a job with Deadpool in Rumekistan. With Weasel having served time to appease Deadpool's anger and with Deadpool having TiVo'd all the episodes of Battlestar Galactica during Weasel's stay in jail to make up for his past abuses, the two became fast friends once more. He assisted Deadpool in the mercenary's latest voyage of self-discovery as Deadpool put himself in a series of situations to regain his rep as a mercenary, then made another attempt to become a hero. Weasel had Deadpool shrunk down to key-ring size in order to bolster his self-confidence, as he was no less effective in his greatly reduced size. On the last of these missions, Weasel was left in a Hydra base during an attack that was an attempt to give Deadpool more street-cred. While being imprisoned on the base, Weasel was apparently able to instead join Hydra, naming himself The Penetraitor, and created a teleportation machine for Hydra's use. This was interrupted by an attack on the base by Wolverine, coinciding with an attempted rescue by Deadpool and Bob, Agent of HYDRA. Deadpool and Bob were there because they knew Wolverine's attack would put Weasel's life in danger. Furthermore, Weasel's seeming joining of Hydra was a ruse; his teleportation gift simply sent the users straight to an American controlled prison.Cable & Deadpool #43 (Sept. 2007). Marvel Comics Although he is not explicitly stated to be a pet owner, Weasel takes Blind Al's dog at her request when he leaves Deadpool, and later on is shown to have a white cat in his apartment. Weasel becomes an associate of the \\"good guy\\" mercenary firm Agency X.Deadpool #49 (2013). Marvel Comics =\\"The House\\"= Weasel returns in Deadpool vol. 2 #23 as Las Vegas hero \\"The House\\". He is funded by the local casinos and takes pleasure at the chance to fight Deadpool. Using his vast knowledge of Deadpool, he quickly traps and defeats him, ultimately locking Wade in his own version of the Box. Deadpool quickly and inexplicably escapes and offers Weasel a chance to double his earnings. He then takes Weasel's extra suit of armor and the alias \\"Wildcard\\", acting as The House's sidekick. Later, in an encounter with a new Grizzly, unbeknownst to Weasel, Deadpool secretly tells Griz about a proposition he has for him. Grizzly manages to escape, and later, when Weasel and Deadpool meet with the casino owners, Deadpool reveals that he is in fact Wildcard, much to Weasel's fury. Later, Wade persuades Weasel to switch suits so that all the praise Wildcard gets will be for Weasel's good deeds. Weasel agrees to the plan, and the two once again face off with Grizzly, now back again and attempting to steal the millions of dollars in the casino's counting room. In the ensuing battle, Weasel fights Grizzly in the Wildcard suit while Deadpool sips drinks as The House. Unfortunately, everyone thinks Weasel is the one in The House suit drinking Lime Rickey's, and worst of all, Deadpool runs off with Grizzly and the cash. So when Deadpool tells the casino bosses that Weasel took off with the money because he wasn't getting any respect, they all believe him. They also believe him when he tells them that Weasel will be returning first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, Weasel talks on the phone with Blind Al, seeking advice, and resolves to take Deadpool down, against Blind Al's protests, and then spots an explosion in the distance. As it turns out, the explosion was caused by Deadpool, back at the casino with Grizzly and attempting to rob the vault. While Grizzly heads for the vault himself, Weasel arrives in the Wildcard suit and confronts Deadpool (who is still in The House's suit). In a parody of The Empire Strikes Back, Deadpool asks Weasel to join him. Weasel refuses and seemingly kills Deadpool by blowing his head off. Grizzly ends up being locked in the casino vault, though he still has the money. The casino owners still think that Weasel was the one in The House suit, so everyone ends up cheering for him as Grizzly is arrested. Later, in his lair, Weasel converses again with Blind Al, who insists that he tell the casino bosses the truth. Weasel is skeptical, but Blind Al reminds him about the possibility that they could have found Deadpool's body by now. Weasel then receives a call from the casino owners who reveal that they found no body. Deadpool shows up and explains that he snuck out of the suit under cover of the smoke from the explosion, and that the money in the casino vault was actually counterfeit money with his face on it. Weasel assumes that Deadpool will kill him, but Deadpool says that he won't, that he will help Weasel out of his jam, that he will take over the Wildcard suit, and that Weasel will have to lie low. When Weasel asks where he will go, Deadpool replies \\"I think we both know the answer to that one, buddy...\\" Later, when Deadpool meets with the casino owners, they claim that he said he'd taken care of Weasel. When they ask him how, he replies, \\"I put him in a Box.\\" Weasel is later freed from the Box by Macho Gomez, who recruits him to his team of people who were screwed over by, and want revenge on, Deadpool, and they confront him in Bob, Agent of HYDRA's garage. In the ensuing battle, Weasel begins to have second thoughts, saying to himself, \\"Stupid, stupid, stupid--I never shoulda come here! Deadpool's gonna do somethin' horrible to me, I know it!\\" to which Deadpool responds from across the room, \\"Hey, Weasel! Come over here so I can do something horrible to you!\\" Fortunately for Weasel, the team (minus Sluggo, whom Weasel inadvertently killed) managed to defeat Deadpool, and Weasel and the others left unscathed. But since they did not actually kill him, Deadpool managed to come back, and kill Weasel as payback for joining Macho Gomez.Deadpool vol 5 #18. Marvel Comics. =Patient Zero= After his death, Weasel was condemned to Hell, which he escapes from with the help of Mephisto. Rechristening himself Patient Zero, he then sets out to get revenge on both Deadpool and Peter Parker, hiring the former to assassinate the latter after making it look like torturous human experimentation was being conducted at Parker Industries, which Patient Zero also steals data from for use in transforming captured homeless people into \\"Manstrosities\\". After the Manstrosities are defeated in a confrontation with Spider-Man and Deadpool, Patient Zero splices the two heroes' DNA into another test subject, turning her into Itsy Bitsy, a psychotic vigilante with the combined powers of both Deadpool and Spider-Man. When his creation turns on him, a desperate Patient Zero reaches out to Spider-Man and Deadpool for aid, and is killed in front of them by Itsy Bitsy. Patient Zero is then returned to Hell, and eventually visited by Deadpool, to whom he reveals his identity, explaining that he was motivated by Deadpool's past abuse and the belief that Deadpool has not changed, and has tricked the world into believing that deep down he is nothing more than \\"a scum-ridden murdering psychopath.\\" Weasel is afterward shown being offered another deal by Mephisto. This one involving Deadpool. Powers and abilities Jack Hammer has no superpowers but he is an expert hacker and inventor with a genius-level intellect and knowledge of many weapons. In other media =Film= *T. J. Miller portrays Weasel in the 2016 feature film Deadpool.Dilip, Mangala (May 6, 2015). \\"'Deadpool' Movie News: 'Weasel' TJ Miller Reveals Major Spoilers\\". International Business Times In the film, he is the owner/bartender at Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children, where Wade works as a mercenary. He bets on Wade to die in the \\"Dead pool,\\" which inspires Wade to adopt the code name later when he gets his powers. Unlike the comics, his and Deadpool's friendship is far more mutual and less hate-based, whereas in the source material Deadpool frequently mistreats him. * Miller reprised the role in Deadpool 2, where he helps Deadpool assemble X-Force and is 'tortured' by Cable about information regarding his friend. =Video game= Weasel appears as a non-playable associate of Deadpool in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Cam Clarke. He is part of a subplot to discover if Nick Fury's second-in-command, Black Widow, is a S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor and requires information gathered by the player in between the missions to help him work, such as passwords named after other characters, other hackers likely to assist him, or suitable hiding places to avoid being found by S.H.I.E.L.D. In the Sanctum Sanctorum, Weasel asks the players if he would be able to hide out at the Baxter Building or the X-Mansion. As Hank Pym states that Mister Fantastic tends to work with S.H.I.E.L.D, The heroes tell Weasel to hide out at the X-Mansion since Professor X stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents on X-Mansion grounds would not sit well with the X-Men. Later on in Asgard, he develops a crush on Valkyrie, who prefers Deadpool and his sense of humor. Deadpool states to Valkyrie that Weasel has that way with women ever since he brought his cousin to the prom. Storm mentions to the players about how some of the X-Men got annoyed with Weasel activating different vehicles and equipment without their authorization. A phone call made during the credits reveal that the Black Widow had been using Weasel to steal information from S.H.I.E.L.D. then setting up Weasel for the fall. As can be expected, he has unique dialogue with Deadpool revealing that Weasel had recently been discharged from the hospital after he and Deadpool fought over cheese puffs and Deadpool stabbed him in the leg.

It acts by inhibiting the enzyme cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase type 5 (). It is the sulfone derivative of sulindac, an NSAID. Unlike sulindac, it has known effects on prostaglandin synthesis. It was developed as the potential treatment of several conditions including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), precancerous sporadic colonic polyps, cervical dysplasia and the prevention of tumor recurrence in prostate and breast cancer. Exisulind inhibits the enzyme cGMP-PDE, overexpressed in precancerous and cancerous colorectal cells, and induces apoptosis in such cells with minimal effects on normal cells. This apoptotic effect is independent of COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition, p53, Bcl-2, or cell cycle arrest. Preclinical evidence suggests that exisulind also inhibits angiogenesis.

The book is largely autobiographical, mixing fact and fiction. It tells the story of the arrival of a new boy, Barry, in the sixth form of an English private school. The school is never named in the novel, but a host of clues (most tellingly the school motto) reveals the school to be Sutcliffe's alma mater, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, a fact that was picked up at the time by the British broadsheet press. Plot summary The book is set in 1986 and is narrated by a Jewish student at the school, Mark, who does not have much success with girls. He finds himself drawn to Barry, who is incredibly handsome. The two become friends, and the book tells of the course of just over a year during which Barry discovers sex with girls and has an affair with a teacher. Mark struggles with his attraction to Barry, but has a relationship with Barry's sister, Louise. Barry, meanwhile, realises that he is, in fact, gay, and enters into a relationship with Mark's brother, Dan, which Mark is unaware of. The four all go on holiday together, and Dan and Barry tell Mark of their relationship. He reacts badly, and accuses them of not being normal. This leads to Barry storming off and Louise dumping Mark. Mark and Barry do have a rapprochement of sorts at the end of the book, but their friendship is over. Mark ends the book contending that he can't be homophobic, because he made it up with his brother. Adaptations The book was adapted for the stage by Russell Labey, and performed at the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It staged a major revival in April 2008 at the Tabard Theatre which subsequently led to a West End production at the Trafalgar Studios in London in March and April 2009, starring Nicholas Hoult as Mark. It is currently running at the Newspace Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa directed by British director Russell Labey and starring Stephen Jubber as Barry.http://www.mambaonline.com/article.asp?artid=3741 References Category:1996 British novels Category:British autobiographical novels Category:Haberdashers' Schools Category:Novels set in Hertfordshire Category:Fiction set in 1986 Category:Novels set in schools Category:Adaptations of works by William Shakespeare ","title":"New Boy (novel)"},{"id":"7723266","text":"SRH Hochschule Berlin (formerly known as OTA Hochschule) is a state-accredited private university in Berlin which is part of SRH Holding.
