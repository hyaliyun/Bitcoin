Early life O'Halloran was born in Berhampore (now Baharampur) India, the second of eight sons of Major-General Sir Joseph O'Halloran, by his wife, Frances, daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayly, M.P., and niece of Henry, 1st Earl of Uxbridge. Thomas was a grandson of Irish surgeon Sylvester O'Halloran, and brother to William Littlejohn O'Halloran. O'Halloran entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (or Marlow) in 1808 and at 16 he was commissioned into the 17th Foot and sailed for India. He served in the Nepal war during the years 1814, 1815, and 1816, became Lieutenant in June 1817, and served in the Deccan war during that and the following year. On 1 August 1821 he married Miss Anne Goss of Dawlish, Devonshire, who died in 1823 in Calcutta, leaving two children. In 1822 he exchanged from the 17th to the 44th Regiment, which he joined in Calcutta in January 1823. In 1824 he was ordered with the left wing of the 44th to Chittagong, where he arrived early in June, and was appointed paymaster, quartermaster, and interpreter. On 30 October he was appointed brigade-major to Brigadier-General Dunkin, C.B., who commanded the Sylket division of the army during the Burmese war, and served on his staff until his death in Nov. 1825. He received a medal for war service in India, for Nepal and Ava. O'Halloran transferred to the 99th Foot as a Captain in 1827. He returned to England after twenty years in India in 1834. On 10 July 1834 he married Miss Jane Waring, of Newry, County Down, and retired on half-pay in October of that year. Soon afterwards he transferred to the Coldstream Guards and was on half pay until he transferred again to the 97th Foot in May 1837. South Australia In 1838 O'Halloran retired from the army by the sale of his commission, and sailed for South Australia the same year with his wife Jane O'Halloran, their sons Thomas Joseph Shuldham and George Waring Wright and his daughter Annie Helen Lucy (by his first wife), in the Rajasthan, landing at Glenelg in November 1838. He established a farm, Lizard Lodge in the Adelaide suburb which now bears his name, O'Halloran Hill. He was made a J.P. in 1839. He was gazetted Major-Commandant of the South Australian Militia on 26 February 1840, and on 8 June as Commissioner of Police. In December 1839 he was appointed by George Gawler as one of four members of a Board of Police Commissioners. Upon the dismissal of the founder and first commander of the police, Superintendent Henry Inman in May 1840, the Board was abolished and O'Halloran was appointed under a new title of Police Commissioner. He retired from Government service in 1843 as a result of his disinclination to serve as both Police Commissioner and Police Magistrate. =Maria controversy= Major O'Halloran's expedition to the Coorong, August 1840. Painting by unknown artist, held at the Art Gallery of South Australia. In June 1840, the brig Maria set sail from Port Adelaide towards Hobart. By July 1840, stories and rumours had circulated that all 26 people on board had survived a shipwreck, but had been killed by members of the Milmenrura, a clan of the Tanganekald people, along the Coorong. After a police investigation, which discovered several mutilated bodies and determined who the murderers were believed to be, Governor Gawler ordered O'Halloran (as police commissioner) and Police Inspector Alexander Tolmer to lead a party of police and sailors to the area. His orders were to find and execute those responsible. On 22 August 1840, after several days of interviews, investigations and a drumhead court-martial, two Milmenrura men were publicly hanged on the Coorong in front of 65 people from their tribe. O'Halloran then told the people (through an interpreter) that their bodies were not to be taken down and that this was to be a warning against violence towards Europeans by Aboriginal people. This was one of the most contentious incidents in South Australian legal history. At the time, Aboriginals in South Australia were considered British subjects, and therefore deemed to be under the protection of British law. Gawler's ordering of a drumhead court-martial and the executions was not well received by the London authorities and contributed to his removal as governor. At that same time O'Halloran's younger brother, Captain (later Major General) Henry Dunn O'Halloran (1800–71), 69th Regt., posted at New Brunswick, Canada, was conducting a significant study of the language and customs of the indigenous Mi'kmaq people. Character Although O'Halloran attracted a reputation for belligerence, one of his mounted troopers of the 1840s related that, \\"Old Major O'Halloran used to say 'I never hated a man longer than a day'\\".Retired trooper Robert Kewley (1821-88), Burra Record, 28 October 1884, p. 3 - via Trove. Family O'Halloran married Anne Goss (died 1823) on 1 August 1821; she had two daughters. He married again, on 10 July 1834, to Jane Waring; they had three sons and one daughter. His eldest son Thomas Joseph Shuldham O'Halloran SM (27 April 1835 – 9 January 1922), married Harriet Julia Woodforde, daughter of the Adelaide Coroner. Their son Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran KC was a noted lawyer and football administrator in South Australia. A daughter Eliza O'Halloran married farmer and flour miller Samuel White in 1853. O'Halloran died at his home \\"Lizard Lodge\\", and was buried at Christ Church, O'Halloran Hill, an Anglican church which he helped to establish and is also located in the suburb, now overlooking the former Glenthorne CSIRO Research station.

He served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, as well as the U.S. House of Representatives, after which he published accounts of his wartime exploits and captivity.FULKERSON, ABRAM, a Representative from VirginiaVirginia Biographical Encyclopedia Family and early life Fulkerson was born on May 13, 1834, in Washington County, Virginia, the youngest son of Abram Fulkerson, Sr. (1789–1859) of Lee County, Virginia and his wife Margaret Laughlin Vance (1796–1864).In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census for Washington County, Virginia, Abraham Fulkerson owned 10 slaves and his household included eight free white persons His family took pride in their military heritage. His grandfather, James Fulkerson, had also served as a Captain, in the Virginia Militia during the American Revolution, joining with the Overmountain Men and fighting the British at the Battle of Kings Mountain. His father, Abram Fulkerson Sr., had served during the War of 1812 as a captain of a Virginia Militia company in Colonel David Sanders' Regiment, 4th Brigade, Norfolk Division under Gen. Peter B. Porter, but by 1850 had moved to Grainger County, Tennessee, where his eldest son James L. Fulkerson died, although Abram Fulkerson Sr. moved back to Washington County, Virginia, before his death in 1859. The family included at least four more sons who survived to adulthood: James Lyon Fulkerson (1816–1849), Samuel Vance Fulkerson (1822–1862), Francis Marion Fulkerson (1825–1894) and Isaac Fulkerson (1831–1889). They also had daughters Mary Vance Fulkerson Davis (1820–1892), Harriet Jane Fulkerson Armstrong (1827–1911) and Katherine Elizabeth Fulkerson (1832–1903).Oddly, slave records do not appear for Abram Fulkerson in either Virginia nor Tennessee in connection with the 1850 census, although a man of that named owned 4 slaves in Boyle, Kentucky. He was dead by the 1860 census and his son Abram taught in Hawkins County, Tennessee, where Francis Fulkerson owned several slaves. Abram, Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington in 1857, where he was a student of Prof. Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson, as had been his elder brother Samuel Vance Fulkerson (1822–1862), who had served in the Mexican–American War and as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850. According to VMI records, Isaac Fulkerson had a reputation for being a prankster and wore an \\"outlandish collar\\" on his cadet uniform: the collar being the only part of the uniform not covered under regulations. After graduation, he taught school in Palmyra, Virginia, then in 1860 in Rogersville, Hawkins County, Tennessee. Confederate officer Fulkerson entered Confederate military service in June 1861 as a Captain, having organized a company of men from Hawkins County, Tennessee, that was mustered into the 19th Tennessee Infantry Regiment as Company K (The Hawkins Boys) at Knoxville, Tennessee. His was the first company of volunteers organized in East Tennessee, and Abram Fulkerson received a commission as the regiment's Major. He was wounded in the thigh and his horse shot from under him at the Battle of Shiloh. After recovery and the unit's reorganization, he was reassigned to the 63rd Tennessee Infantry. Commissioned as Lieutenant Colonel of the 63rd, and President Jefferson Davis on February 12, 1864, commissioned him as a full colonel. In January 1862, Abram Fulkerson received a furlough and went to Clarksville, Tennessee and married his fiancé, Selina Johnson (1832–1918) on January 28. They were barely married in time to escape the Union Army's advance on Clarksville.In the 1870 census they lived with their 6 year old son Samuel and two domestic servants in Goodson, Washington County, Virginia, as family no. 32 In June, 1862 his brother Col. Samuel Vance Fulkerson was killed in action leading the 37th Virginia Infantry at the Battle of Gaines Mill, the first major victory of General Robert E. Lee. Another brother, Isaac Fulkerson (c. 1829-July 20, 1889), was a captain in the 8th Texas Cavalry (Terry's Texas Rangers). Abram Fulkerson twice helped garrison the Cumberland Gap: first with the 19th Tennessee then with the 63rd Tennessee. On May 18, 1863, while at Cumberland Gap, he penned a letter to his wife in which he noted that he was visited there by President Jefferson Davis: > One of our pickets came in the other day and reported that a Mr. Davis was > at the lines and desired to enter. This report took me very much by > surprise, for although you had mentioned the probability of his coming yet I > did not look for him. He only stayed a few hours. After dinner (a very poor > one without apology to him) I went [around] to show him some of the > curiosities of Cumberland Gap, which he seemed to think would compensate any > one for making the visit.

Jackson came upon us like a shock. We > feel that his death is a national calamity. The poorest soldiers among us > appreciated his worth - loved the man, and mourn his loss. I knew him well.1 > He was my preceptor for more than four years and whilst during that time I > did not appreciate the man, as school [schoolboys?]are not like to do, yet I > always had great reverence for the man on account of his piety & uprightness > of character.

It is > [illegible] therefore that we make the sacrifice cheerfully, th'o we cannot > see why our country should be deprived of his services at his her hour of > greatest need. Prisoner of War While in the 63rd, Fulkerson was wounded twice more: in the left arm at the Battle of Chickamauga and again at the Second Battle of Petersburg, Virginia (Battle of Petersburg II), the regiment having been reassigned from the Army of Tennessee to the Army of Northern Virginia. He was taken prisoner on June 17, 1864, and sent to the POW camp at Fort Delaware. On April 18, 1892, Fulkerson wrote an account of his capture and experiences as a prisoner. He related the events of his capture: While a POW, Fulkerson became part of the Immortal Six Hundred, 600 captured Confederate officers who were taken to Morris Island at Charleston, South Carolina and used as human shields by the Union Army for six weeks in an attempt to silence the Confederate gunners at Fort Sumter, in response to Union officer prisoners being placed among civilians to stop Union gunners from firing into downtown Charleston. Though none of the Immortal Six Hundred were killed by the continuing Confederate artillery fire from Fort Sumter, 14 died of dysentery. Of his time on Morris Island he wrote in the same 1892 account: After Morris Island, Fulkerson was taken to Fort Pulaski and placed on starvation rations for 42 days in retaliation for Confederate prisoner abuses at Andersonville. Crowded into the fort's cold, damp casements, the Confederates' \\"retaliation ration\\" consisted of 10 ounces of moldy cornmeal and a half pint of soured onion pickles. The starving men supplemented their rations with the occasional rat or stray cat. Thirteen men died there of preventable diseases such as dysentery and scurvy. At Fort Pulaski, the prisoners organized \\"The Relief Association of Fort Pulaski for Aid and Relief of the Sick and Less Fortunate Prisoners\\" on December 13, 1864, and Fulkerson was elected president. Out of their sparse funds, the prisoners collected and spent eleven dollars, according to a report filed by Fulkerson on December 28, 1864. In March 1865 Fulkerson was returned to Fort Delaware, where he was discharged and paroled on July 25, 1865, months after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. While at Fort Delaware, prisoners were taken out to the badly polluted river every day and allowed to bathe and swim. Fulkerson, a very thin man with auburn hair, could float \\"like a cork\\" and would lie on his back and float out with the current for ten or fifteen minutes until the nervous guards, fearing that an escape attempt, ordered him to return to the shore. After Fulkerson returned home, his horse that he rode during his military service, whose official name was \\"Zollicoffer\\" (after former Congressman and early Confederate casualty Felix Zollicoffer), was returned to him. Fulkerson kept the horse for the rest of its life, but called him \\"Old Bob.\\" When the horse died, former Confederates from the Bristol area assembled and conducted a military funeral for it. In 1885, Stonewall Jackson's horse, \\"Little Sorrel,\\" was brought to Bristol on a tour and Fulkerson rode it as a number of former veterans assembled to pay their respects. Legal and political career As the war ended, Fulkerson studied law, was admitted to the bar and began his legal practice in Goodson, later known as Bristol, Virginia, in 1866 with the firm of York & Fulkerson. As a lawyer, he was regarded as a legal giant in Bristol and it is said that he was such a gifted orator that many of the local citizens would go to court and sit in on trials just to hear him speak. Fulkerson was elected and re-elected to the Virginia House of Delegates as one of two delegates representing Washington County, Virginia (part-time). He served from 1871 to 1875, until voters replaced both delegates. Next he served in the State senate of Virginia 1877–1881.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619–1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 515, 519, 528, 531 Voters from Virginia's 9th congressional district elected Fulkerson as a Readjuster Democrat from to the Forty-seventh Congress (March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1883). He defeating incumbent James Buchanan Richmond, a lawyer and banker (and former subordinate officer to his brother Samuel in the 37th Virginia), in the Democratic primary. Fulkerson helped organize the Readjuster Party, after which he returned to the Democratic Party. Fulkerson resumed his legal practice after deciding against seeking re- election to Congress. Fellow Readjuster Henry Bowen succeeded him. Voters again elected Fulkerson to the State House of Delegates in 1888, alongside John A. Buchanan who together replaced Daniel Trigg and Jonas S. Kelly and were in turn replaced in 1887 by John Roberts and S. P. Edmonson.Leonard p. 543 After retiring from politics, Fulkerson wrote a memoir of his captivity and published it in 1894.Avram Fulkerson, \\"The Prison Experience of a Confederate Soldier,\\" SOUTHERN HISTORICAL SOCIETY PAPERS, Volume XXII. Richmond, Va., January–December, 1894, Pages 128 - 147, http://www.csa- dixie.com/csa/prisoners/t64.htm Fulkerson was a delegate to the Democratic National (Gold) Convention in 1896. Death and legacy Fulkerson died in Bristol, Virginia, on December 17, 1902, at the age of 68, of complications after suffering a stroke. He was buried there in East Hill Cemetery in Sullivan County, Tennessee. Henry Clinton Wood who served as the Major of the 37th Virginia Infantry (CS) under Fulkerson's brother Samuel Vance, and for whom the town of Clintwood, Virginia, was named, served as an honorary pallbearer in the funeral. His widow would survive for a decade, and his son Samuel Vance Fulkerson (1863–1926), although he married in Grayson, Texas, would become a Virginia lawyer and die aged 64 in Virginia Beach on July 2, 1926, and be buried in the same cemetery. VMI maintains the Fulkerson family papers in its library's archives. The Sons of Confederate Veterans Abram Fulkerson Camp 2104 in Greeley, Colorado, bears his name.

History SITD was founded by Jacek and Lau in the Ruhr Area of Germany. In the next three years they self-produced and released their first two albums, mourning country (1996) and Atomic (1999). In 1999, Lau left the band to be replaced by Thomas Lesczenski. In 2001, André Sorge joined the band and they toured with VNV Nation and XPQ-21 on the Futureperfect tour. In 2001, SITD also released their largest hit single to-date, Snuff Machinery, which made liberal use of sampled dialogue from the German dub of the film 8mm, a 1999 US thriller dealing with snuff films. Sorge left the band by the end of the year. In 2002, SITD released their first EP album, Snuff EP under the record label Accession Records and performed at the Zillo Festival. In 2003, Francesco D'Angelo joined SITD and they released the EP Laughingstock and then the full-length album Stronghold. Stronghold reached the 2nd Position in the Top Album National category for 2003 on the Deutsche Alternative Chart (DAC). They also performs at two major festivals: M'era Luna and Infest. In 2004, they performed at the Zillo Festival (with Skinny Puppy), and the Elektronisches Hilfswerk Charity Tour with VNV Nation, Combichrist and NamNamBulu. In 2005, they released the Coded Message:12 album as well as the EPs Richtfest and Odyssey:13. The band went on their Coded Message tour, and performed once again at the Zillo and M'era Luna festivals, as well as support act on VNV Nation's Formation Tour. By the end of the year they were in 3rd Position in the Top Single Act National category for 2005 on the Deutsche Alternative Chart (DAC). In 2007, they featured as one of two acts (alongside Painbastard) on the double EP Klangfusion Vol.1. This was a prelude to the band's 3rd full- length album Bestie:Mensch. The limited edition of this album featured a 2nd CD compiling a number of remixes SITD had assembled for other bands over the years. In 2008 the band remixed two songs from Industrial Metal group Eisbrecher's Sünde album This is Deutsch and Kann denn Liebe Sünde Sein. In 2010, they toured with VNV Nation on their Faith, Power, and Glory tour.

As a youth, he studied many different martial arts including Togin- ryu, Okumura Nito-ryu, Takenouchi-ryu, Kito-ryu and Saburi-ryu. By 1938, he became a master in iaido and jujutsu and established his own dojo, the Kogado dojo in Okayama. In 1938, he met Morihei Ueshiba at Okayama, who told him about the technique of \\"aikibudo\\" he created and invited him to his dojo in Tokyo. Hirai found similarities in Ueshiba's art based on circular motions with his own style of jujutsu he was developing and decided to enter Ueshiba's Kobukan dojo. During World War II, Hirai was the head of the jujutsu department of the Japanese Army's military police school and was instrumental in developing a new arrest technique employed by the military police. In 1942, he was appointed director of the General Affairs for the Kobukan Dojo by Ueshiba, helping him with daily matters at the dojo. The same year he was sent as the Kobukan representative to the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, an organization promoting martial arts in Japan, and was instrumental in creating the term \\"aikido\\" to refer to Ueshiba's art within the Butokukai's circle. In July 1945, the Butokukai awarded him the rank of Hanshi. He died in 1998.  Korindo aikido  His own style, , was founded in 1938 and combined elements from classical jujutsu and traditional Japanese weaponry with the early teachings of Ueshiba. It is based on the principle of circular tai sabaki. In October 1945, he established the Korindo Dojo in Shizuoka. In September 1953, the Korindo Dojo in Tokyo was inaugurated. Korindo’s taisabaki consists of seven forms or kata: kesagiri, kote-sabaki, irimisabaki, shihosabaki, isogaeshi, tsuiage e ushirosabaki. Usually they are practiced solo, but they can also be done with a partner. These seven kata are practiced to the front, back, right, and left, and they help develop the ability to apply techniques from any position. Minoru Hirai’s unique taisabaki forms, which constitute the basis of his Korindo Aikido, can be practiced empty-handed, with a sword, short staff, or spear. The goal is to express the natural mind as natural martial arts techniques.

He joined the Argentine Navy and had an unremarkable career until the 1946 election of Juan Perón. Under Perón  He was Naval attache in Brazil and Uruguay, and later he became close to the influential First Lady, Eva Perón, and served as her naval aide-de-camp until her death in 1952. He was then named head of the Río Santiago Naval Academy (site of an important naval shipyard), though in August 1955, he was persuaded to take part in the coup d'état that toppled Perón on September 19. Credited with leading the Navy during the rebellion, Rojas obtained Perón's resignation and exile by commandeering the ARA General Belgrano - threatening to bombard the YPF refinery in Ensenada (then the nation's largest). Vice President On 23 September 1955 he was rewarded with the Vice Presidency at the Navy's insistence, and remained in the post until President Pedro Aramburu relinquished power to elected authorities in May 1958. Rojas imposed a staunch anti-Peronist and anti-Communist as Vice President, though he supported Aramburu's call for Constitutional Assembly elections in 1957, overcoming objections from the largely conservative Navy.Potash, Robert.The Army and Politics in Argentina. Stanford University Press, 1996. Peronism was banned, and remained so until 1972. In 1958 as commander of Naval Operations of the Argentine Navy he was involved in the Snipe incident. He ordered the destruction of the Chilean lighthouse and its replacement with an Argentine one.See book of Isaac Francisco Rojas, (compiler), La Argentina en el Beagle y Atlántico sur, (1° Parte), Cap IV, section 4, page 131 :\\"Yo, en persona, llevé a Ushuaia una baliza luminosa, la que en la segunda quincena de abril fue instalada en el islote Snipe en lugar de la señal chilena violadora del statu quo\\".  Return to Democracy  Following the return to democracy with the election of President Arturo Frondizi, Rojas remained a vocal supporter of military action to prevent the return of Peronism, and participated in a failed, April 1963 coup attempt against President José María Guido (who was himself appointed in Frondizi's replacement for the sake of preventing a Peronist resurgence at the polls). Following Army Chief Juan Carlos Onganía's defeat of the coup attempt, Rojas was confined to his uptown Buenos Aires apartment, after which he largely limited his contact with the public to occasional columns in conservative newspapers such as La Prensa and La Nación. He opposed the Antarctic Treaty of 1961 and later to the Beagle Channel Arbitration. He was founder of the “Movimiento Pro-impugnación del Laudo Arbitral del Beagle”GEOGRAFÍA, GUERRA Y NACIONALISMO.

(2006). Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany, New York: Simon & Schuster. , p. 38. Created in 1920 at Langley Field, Virginia, it relocated to Maxwell Field, Alabama, in July 1931. Instruction at the school was suspended in 1940, anticipating the entry of the United States into World War II, and the school was dissolved shortly after. ACTS was replaced in November 1942 by the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics. In addition to the training of officers in more than 20 areas of military education, the school became the doctrine development center of the Air Corps, and a preparatory school for Air Corps officers aspiring to attendance at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College. The motto of the Air Corps Tactical School was Proficimus More Irretenti—\\"We Make Progress Unhindered by Custom\\". The Air Corps Tactical School was notable as the birthplace of the Army Air Forces doctrine of daylight precision bombing. This doctrine held that a campaign of daylight air attacks against critical targets of a potential enemy's industrial infrastructure, using long-range bombers heavily armed for self-defense, could defeat an enemy nation even though its army and navy remained intact. The Tactical School, in formulating the doctrine, rejected the idea of attacking civilians.Griffith, Charles (1999). The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II. Air University Press , pp. 42. Four former instructors of the school, the core of a group known as the \\"Bomber Mafia\\", were grouped together in the Air War Plans Division to produce the two war- winning plans—AWPD-1 and AWPD-42—based on the doctrine of precision daylight bombing that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces. In a broader sense, the strategic bombing doctrine, adapted by factors encountered during combat, was also the foundation for the final separation of the Air Force from the Army as a military service independent of and equal to the other services. In 1946 the AAF created the Air University to carry on the work and traditions of the ACTS. Background Brig.Gen. William Lendrun \\"Billy\\" Mitchell At the end of World War I, observation remained the main role of the Air Service. However, air combat and limited bombardment operations indicated to veterans of the Air Service, including Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, that while ideally the service should be separate from the Army, it at the least should be centralized under an Air Service commander with some missions independent of direct support of troops. In reorganizing the post-war Army, the Armed Forces Reorganization Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 759) rebuked these ideas but did establish the Air Service as a statutory entity (previously it had existed by executive order only) and assigned it status as a \\"combatant arm of the line.\\"Finney, Robert T. (1955). USAF Historical Studies No. 100: History of the Air Corps Tactical School, Center for Air Force History, March 1955 edition, as are all references listed, pp. 4–5. The Air Service followed the precedent of the other combat arms and began planning for its own service schools. An \\"Air Service School of Application\\" for technical training in aeronautical engineering, similar to the Ordnance School of Application at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, was set up at McCook Field, and began its first class 10 November 1919.Laubenthal, Capt. Sanders A. (1982) From Huffman Prairie to the Moon: The History of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, AFLC, US Government Printing Office, p. 399. Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher, Director of Air Service, wrote the War Department in October 1919 for permission to establish a tactical school at Langley Field, Virginia, to train field grade officers in the operation and tactics of the Air Service as a requirement for higher command or staff work.Finney, p. 5. On 25 February 1920, the War Department authorized the Air Service to establish its service schools. In addition to six pilot and advanced pilot training schools, and two technical training schools, an Air Service School was planned. It proposed to host courses for enlisted personnel as balloon observers, balloon mechanics, and aerial photography, but its main course was to be the Field Officers Course.Finney, pp. 5–6. Langley Field, 1920–1931 =Air Service Field Officers School= Major Thomas DeWitt Milling was assigned as officer-in- charge of the Field Officers Course at the new school and sent to Langley in July 1920 to set it up. War Department General Order No. 18 authorized the school on 14 August 1920.Reither, Joseph. Army Air Forces Historical Study No. 13: The Development of Tactical Doctrines at AAFSAT and AAFTAC. 1944, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, p. 6. The balloon courses were split off into a separate school in a different area of Langley and the Air Service School was renamed the Air Service Field Officers School on 10 February 1921,Air University Chronology 1920s–1930s after its primary function.Finney, p. 6, and note 18, p. 44. The Air Service ordered 17 officers to Langley, eight as students and nine as instructors, although several officers swapped roles and some instructors were students as well.Finney, p. 6. The 1920–1921 class opened on 1 November 1920, and although scheduled to last nine months, was concluded in May when both students and instructors were assigned to the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, as part of the experimental bombing of captured warships by the Air Service and the United States Navy. 11 officers, including four instructors, graduated the first course. The second class, beginning in October 1921, was devoted to the further training of instructors, the creation of a sound administrative system, and development of a well-rounded course curriculum. In the first two classes, despite the school's title and function, only six of the first 23 graduates were field grade officers. A board reviewing all service schools of the United States Army observed that the Field Officers School had a course load that in other branches of the Army was distributed among several schools. Because all other Air Service schools were technical training in nature, the board recommended that the school be opened to all air service officers regardless of rank. Accordingly, Army regulations changed the name of the school to that of Air Service Tactical School on 8 November 1922. With the passage of the Air Corps Act of 1926, the school again changed its name, becoming the Air Corps Tactical School on 2 July 1926.Reither, p. 6. While at Langley, the ACTS was hampered by a chronic shortage of instructors, caused by a lack of policy within the Army for filling vacancies despite a rapid turnover in staff in the first three years. School administrators were forced to double as instructors. The situation was somewhat ameliorated in August 1924 when the Chief of the Air Service authorized extended duty for instructors, most of whom afterwards served four-year tours on the faculty, with an overlap between incoming and outgoing staff. Between 1925 and 1929 the number of instructors gradually doubled to 16 but even that number proved insufficient to research the vast collection of aviation literature the school's library was collecting to establish doctrine.Finney, p. 10. Despite school recommendations to the contrary, class size gradually increased, reaching 40 students by 1931.Finney, p. 11. The first student from a branch other than the Air Service (an infantry officer) attended ASTS in 1923–1924. This became standard when the 1926–1927 class had five officers representing the other combat branches of the United States Army and three from the United States Marine Corps assigned as students.Finney, p. 12. The functioning of the school was also handicapped by a lack of permanent facilities, especially in quarters, and the school did not have a permanent academic building. When the five-year expansion program outlined in the Air Corps Act of 1926 failed to address these problems, and the creation of new units at Langley interrupted the functioning of the practical flying course, the Air Service began seeking a new location for the Tactical School.Finney, p. 14. The 1930–1931 class was the last at Langley. In its eleven years at Langley, the Tactical School graduated 221 students. =Tactical School curriculum= The academic curriculum was standardized in 1922 by the Army's board tasked with preparing \\"programs of instruction\\" for all Army schools. 1,345 hours of instruction in 20 subjects, taught over a nine-month period beginning on or about 1 September of each school year, included approximately 900 hours of tactics, including those of other services and combined arms tactics, although more than half (480 hours) were devoted to air tactics in observation, bombardment, pursuit, and attack aviation. Approximately 290 hours involved technical subjects, including aeronautical engineering, armament and gunnery, navigation, meteorology, and photography, and 150 to administrative studies, covering staff duties, combat orders, organization of the Army, military and international law, supply and courses in equitation and stable management.Finney, p. 7. The curriculum was altered in July 1923 by the newly created Director of Instruction, Capt. Earl Naiden, cutting the academic course by 500 hours to 845 total hours. 450 hours of the cuts came from the various tactics subjects, although the equitation courses were also eliminated, and all academic courses were scheduled in mornings.Finney, p. 8. Naiden added courses in the history of the Air Service and map reading to the academics, and a 126-hour afternoon course in practical flying, instituted to provide refresher training to pilots but required of all students, including those of non-aviation branches. The course structure remained the same until 1939, with changes only in individual course subjects, averaging 25 hours per week of classroom study and 3.7 hours weekly of flying. The first printed texts covering air tactics replaced mimeographed texts in 1924. This development of the tactics portion of the school led to increased emphasis, and in 1925 aeronautical engineering was eliminated from the curriculum. Theoretical use of airpower was first advanced in 1928, and beginning in 1929 a new course was taught at the end of each class, \\"The Air Force\\", coordinating all air topics covered during the year.Finney, pp. 12–13. Army regulations also made the commander of the 2nd Wing, as the base commander at Langley, the commandant of the Tactical School. However, during its first four years this caused little disruption as Milling, first as officer in charge and then as assistant commandant, remained in actual charge of the school. In 1924 Maj. Oscar Westover became the first commandant to exercise control over school activities. The assistant commandant then became responsible for academics, assisted by the director of instruction, directors of the individual academic departments, and the school secretary (formerly the school adjutant). Course instruction assumed a pattern combining both theory and practical instruction. Subjects were generally scheduled in blocks, particularly tactics, beginning with those of other branches and services, along with logistics and staff functions, from the beginning of each class until December. The courses in air tactics followed, described by one student as coming with \\"bewildering rapidity.\\"Finney, p. 22. Practical instruction came in the form of \\"field problems,\\" initiated in the classroom, then demonstrated and practiced in the practical flying course. Annual inspection trips were also undertaken until 1930 to the Engineering Division at McCook and Wright Fields in Dayton, Ohio, when trips began to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Beginning in 1924, ACTS students also participated in the annual Army War College maneuvers at Ft. DuPont, Delaware. However, by 1931 doctrinal disagreements between the schools and the exclusion of ACTS staff from the planning process created a perceived misuse of airpower on the part of AWC planners that ACTS assistant commandant Maj. John F. Curry criticized as not being of value to students of either school. Although Air Corps input resulted in some improvements, a lack of funds eliminated ACTS participation after 1933.Finney, pp. 13–14, 20. Maxwell Field, 1931–1940 =Relocation= Austin Hall, Air Corps Tactical School Difficulties with dilapidated facilities at Langley were not resolved, and a proposed relocation to Staten Island was rejected by the staff for lack of year-round flying weather, urban restrictions on flying, and a lack of support facilities.Finner, p. 46. Locations at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; San Antonio, Texas; Fort Riley, Kansas; and another area of Langley Field were studied before the choice was made of Maxwell Field, a depot in Montgomery, Alabama, as the site for the school. Plans were developed for a campus to accommodate a tactical school of 75 students, a squadron officers school of 50 junior officer students, and a school demonstration flying group of four squadrons. Congress appropriated almost $700,000 by July 1929 for new buildings, including Building 800-Austin Hall to house the Tactical School, and $200,000 to purchase acreage on which to build new officer quarters. Delays in construction caused two postponements of the relocation until June 1931, when Austin Hall was completed. On 15 July 1931, the school completed its move, although officer quarters were not begun until 1932.Finney, p. 15. Architects commissioned by the Quartermaster Corps designed 99 residences for officers in an elegant style they deemed \\"French Provencial,\\" and placed them in a neighborhood setting that became \\"the showplace of the Air Corps.\\"Maxwell AFB Senior Officers Quarters Historic District The construction program at Maxwell continued until 1938, funded primarily by the WPA and PWA. A bombing and gunnery range was also set up near Valparaiso, Florida, for Tactical School use.Finney, p. 16. =Course restructured= Aerial view of Maxwell Field in 1937 In 1934 Curry, now ACTS Commandant, reorganized the academic structure of the school along functional lines into three principal departments: Air Tactics, Ground Tactics, and Basic and Special Instruction. Flying was a fourth department. The \\"Air Force\\", \\"Attack\\", \\"Bombardment\\", \\"Pursuit\\", and \\"Observation\\" sections were placed within the Department of Air Tactics. The next year these departments became the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, Department of Ground Tactics, and Department of Command, Staff and Logistics. Four faculty committees were also established to administrate scheduling, the school library, and publication of doctrine. The Air Corps Board, which had been inactive since the move from Langley, was permanently relocated to Maxwell in 1933. Restructured by the Tactical School faculty, who doubled as its members, the Board was directed by the War Department to formulate Air Corps doctrine. The Board became indistinguishable from the Tactical School and undertook 77 projects between 1935 and 1942, a third of which dealt with tactical doctrine, and the remainder with equipment, armaments, field manuals, and training texts.Finney, p. 18. After the move to Maxwell, the practice of requiring students to fly actual missions as part of the instruction process was discontinued for safety reasons. Plans for a composite school group were suspended by the Chief of the Air Corps because of a service-wide shortage of personnel and aircraft, and attempts to have demonstrations by existing combat units were mostly unsatisfactory. The demonstration group was not authorized until August 1939 and was utilized for less than a year before classes were suspended. In 1938 the Department of Flying Instruction was dissolved and its functions parceled out to the remaining departments. The Department of Air Tactics and Strategy became the dominant division at the school, and its Air Force Section the most important course, in which airpower theories were presented and explored, doctrine emerging as much from the students as from the faculty.Shiner, John F. (1997). \\"The Coming of the GHQ Air Force, 1925–1935\\", Winged Shield, Winged Sword: A History of the United States Air Force, Vol. I 1907–1950. Air Force History and Museums Program. pp. 111–112. Association with the Infantry School increased, but inspection trips formerly used at Langley first became voluntary and then were discontinued. Only a handful of graduates had gone on to attend the Command and General Staff School, and as a result the Tactical School ended its role as a preparatory school. Instead the ACTS became the equivalent for Air Corps officers of C&GSS;, and increased the emphasis on air subjects to more than half of the total course hours by 1934–1935, with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects.Finney, p. 20. Classroom studies were similarly altered. Lectures occupied only half of a classroom hour, with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of alternative ideas. =Short course= The limited class size at the Tactical School led the Air Corps in 1938 to study the feasibility of using a series of shorter courses to allow a greater number of officers to attend. The study concluded that a significant number of potential staff and command officers had not attended the school and was growing annually. It recommended that the nine-month course be discontinued for a year and four 12-week courses scheduled, each having 100 students, all drawn from the group of prospective senior staff. The plan had the drawbacks of limiting the amount of detail to which students could be exposed, and would require a rebuilding of the staff and curriculum when the long course was reinstated. Nevertheless, the curriculum was changed from 712 academic hours to 298. The short courses began on 1 June 1939, and continued for the next year. Theory and doctrine =Ascendance of bomber theory= In its first years, the Tactical School taught that pursuit aviation was the most important of air operations, epitomized by the 1925–1926 class text Employment of Combined Air Force that compared the importance of pursuit to the Air Service to that of infantry to the Army. However, in 1926 the Tactical School modified this principle by asserting for the first time that airpower could strike at vital points deep inside enemy territory rather than merely targeting an enemy's military forces in a war of attrition. By 1931 the Tactical School was teaching that \\"a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop.\\" This shift in emphasis from pursuit to bombardment was the result of two factors: the air war theories of the time and the state of aviation technology.Griffith, pp. 39–40. Devotees of Billy Mitchell, many of whom had served with the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, dominated the faculty of the Tactical School at Maxwell. With their students, they developed a theory of warfare that invoked the superiority of the long-range bomber over all other types of aircraft. Going beyond Mitchell's ideas, they de-emphasized balanced forces and support of ground troops in favor of a doctrine that heavily armed bombers could fight their way to industrial targets in daylight, unescorted by fighters, and with precision bombing (made possible by the introduction of the Norden bombsight in 1931),Miller, p. 39Griffith, p. 15. defeat an enemy by destroying key war production targets, rather than engaging in costly and prolonged ground campaigns aimed at destroying enemy armies.Shiner, p. 112. While the theory was based on tenets of strategic airpower developed by Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet,Griffith, p. 43. it rejected the concept of terror-bombing of civil populations as a means of destroying the morale and coercing the will of an enemy state.Griffith, pp. 49–50.Miller, p. 39–40. The formulators of this doctrine were relatively young junior officers, nearly all of them former reservists commissioned during or immediately after World War I. They viewed war in the abstract, admitted (and even apologized for) being unable to offer conclusive proof of their theories,Finney, p. 26. but firmly believed that the dominance of airpower lay ahead in the future, when existing limitations of technology had been overcome. Nine key advocates, all of whom instructed at the Tactical School, became known as the \\"Bomber Mafia.\\" The unofficial leader of the group was the bombardment section chief and later director of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, Major Harold L. George.In addition to George, the Bomber Mafia consisted of future generals Haywood S. Hansell, Laurence Kuter, Muir Fairchild, Robert Olds, Kenneth Walker, Robert M. Webster, and Donald Wilson, and Major Odas Moon, who died in 1937. Their impact was such that when the fighter community worked to gain primacy in the USAF in the 1970s, the initial driving force, led by Col. John Boyd, was dubbed the \\"Fighter Mafia\\". The doctrine brought them in conflict with the Army General Staff, which did not view airpower as a major striking arm but as an auxiliary to the ground forces. Despite the poor performance of what few bombers the Air Corps possessed, the air theorists persisted in their beliefs, testifying in favor of a separate air force before commissions set up in the wake of the Air Mail scandal.Shiner, p. 128. Although flawed and tested only under optimal conditions, the doctrine (originally known as the \\"industrial web theory\\")Griffith, p. 45. Lt.Col. Donald Wilson of ACTS and a \\"Bomber Mafia\\" member is credited with the term. became the primary airpower strategy of the United States in the planning for World War II. Four former instructors of the school, the core of the \\"Bomber Mafia\\", produced the two airpower war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces. =Failure of pursuit theory= The doctrine was not universally held among air officers, however. Claire L. Chennault, chief of the pursuit section between 1931 and 1936, reasoned that the same technology that would increase the performance of the bomber would also eventually enable the single-engine fighter to challenge the bomber at high altitude, which it could not do in the years when the daylight bombing doctrine was formulated. Combined with a centralized early warning and control system (which came with the development of radar), defending interceptors would inflict serious losses on unescorted forces.Greer, Thomas H. (1985). The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917–1941 USAF Historical Studies No. 89. Office of Air Force History, p. 63–65. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell, who believed that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.Griffith, p.13. Chennault, however, also had a blind spot in his zealous advocacy of fighters as the offensive weapon of the Air Corps. He consciously avoided acknowledging the role of accompanying escort fighters as part of an offensive air strike. When his tour at ACTS ended, the fighter- versus-bomber controversy became a moot point among the staff, to the detriment of developing a role for escort fighters.Hansell noted that when Chennault commanded the China Air Task Force/14th Air Force a few years later, he both demanded more fighters as bomber escorts and made extravagant claims regarding the effectiveness of his bombers. Although the proponents of daylight precision bombing at the Tactical School had a \\"failure of imagination\\" in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success,Miller, p.41. and thus contributed to the delay in the development of a long-range escort fighter until two years into the war, the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army, and the basis for modern airpower theory. ACTS graduate, instructor, and \\"Bomber Mafia\\" member Haywood S. Hansell, concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the AWPD-1 war plan (he was both) made a serious mistake in neglecting long-range fighter escort in their ideas.Hansell, Haywood S. Jr. (1979). The Air Plan That Defeated Hitler, Ayer Press, , p.22. Hansell wrote: > It was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable, but no one > could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber > yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through > proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings. However he also stated that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential to the creation of the United States Air Force.Greer, p. 60.Tate, Dr. James P. (1998). The Army and its Air Corps: Army Policy Toward Aviation 1919–1941, Air University Press, p. 163. Development of fighters was not ignored; by October 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, every type of piston-driven single-engine fighter used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in World War II had made its first flight except the P-47 Thunderbolt. However, the press of the enormous tasks confronting the Air Corps and the primacy of strategic bombing doctrine meant that development of a long-range capability for these new fighters was not undertaken until combat losses to bombers forced the issue. School closure and legacy Before the short courses began, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for an expansion of the Air Corps in January 1939. The need for experienced officers to supervise the expansion led to plans to reduce the size of the faculty and long course classes as a compromise to keep the school functioning. Six of the 24 Air Corps instructors would be returned to regular duty and class sizes would be reduced from 60 to 20 students. However World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939, before the staff and class reductions could be implemented. The Air Corps permitted the short courses to be finished, but suspended all instruction on 30 June 1940. The Tactical School was reduced to a caretaker staff of seven officers, including two librarians.Finney, p. 41. One year later the Tactical School came under the control of the Southeast Air Corps Training Center, headquartered at Maxwell, with the objective of re-opening the school immediately. After completion of a study, the center recommended in July 1941 that the Tactical School curriculum be modified into a ten-week basic course in tactics for squadron and group level junior grade officers, to instruct 2,000 officers its first year and 5,000 officers thereafter, ending its twin missions of senior officer service school and doctrine development center. Instead the Air Corps Board was moved to Eglin Field, Florida and absorbed by the Air Corps Proving Ground, while all remaining staff of the Tactical School were transferred to Washington, D.C., where they continued work (mainly the production of training literature) until 30 June 1942, after which the school went unstaffed until its formal dissolution in 1946.Finney, pp. 41–42. The ACTS at Maxwell graduated 870 officers, 400 of them in the short courses. During its entire history, the Tactical School trained 1,091 officers, 916 of them in the Air Service or Air Corps. 158 graduates from other arms included 118 Army officers, 35 Marines, and five Naval officers. The Tactical School also trained 17 officers from foreign countries.Finney, p. 24. Of the 320 general officers in the Army Air Forces at the end of World War II, 261 were Tactical School graduates, including 14 of the 18 highest-ranking AAF generals.Finney, p. 25. 134 officers (including 21 from the Army and Navy) served on the faculty of the Tactical School during its 20 years of existence, 58 of whom became general officers.Finney, pp. 53–63.Notable non-Air Corps instructors were Courtney Hodges and Miles Browning. The senior service school function was abandoned for the duration of World War II in favor of development of an actual tactical center, responsible for the mass teaching of all aspects of air warfare to inexperienced officers who would become commanders of newly created units. Although commandants at ACTS had lobbied throughout its existence for the Tactical School to serve as the nucleus of such a center, it instead became the function of a new school, the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, activated 27 October 1942, in Orlando, Florida, both for the training of unit cadres and the continuing development of tactical doctrine.Finney, p. 42. The experiences of World War II created a new impetus for professional education of air commanders, as it had after World War I, but on a much vaster scale. The expectation of becoming a separate service from the Army resulted in planning for a service-wide educational system, the nucleus of which would be the Air University. Established in 1946, AU coordinated all professional education for Air Force officers, and \\"fell heir to the purpose and tradition of the old Tactical School\\".Finney, p. 43.

Lewis Edson Waterman Waterman's fountain pen, patented February 12, 1884 Lewis Edson Waterman's entry into fountain pen manufacturing has only recently been properly researched. Waterman was working as a pen salesman in New York for a new company founded in the spring of 1883 by a volatile inventor named Frank Holland. Holland abandoned his company after only six weeks; Waterman stepped in and took over, fitting the pens with a simplified feed of his own design. It was for this \\"three fissure feed\\" which his first pen-related patent was granted in 1884. Fountain Pen, February 12, 1884 Waterman is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain, MA. Following his death in Brooklyn in 1901, his nephew Frank D. Waterman took the business overseas and increased sales to 350,000 pens per year. Waterman was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. The ink blot myth There has been a great deal of mythologizing of Waterman's life and career. The tale that he was prompted to invent a better fountain pen upon losing an insurance sale after the contract was spoiled by an ink blot left by a balky fountain pen has been widely repeated, but is completely unfounded.Rimakis and Kirchheimer, pp. 1-12 Early life Waterman was born in Decatur, New York. His father was a wagon maker who died when Lewis was three. The boy grew up on his stepfather's farm, attending the district school until he was fifteen, then attending the seminary at Charlottesville, New York for some three months. Still fifteen, he began teaching, supplementing his income by carpentry work. Waterman chiefly taught Pitman shorthand (\\"stenography\\"), which took him to Illinois and Virginia. Other career paths Waterman began selling insurance in 1862, starting in Michigan but relocating to Boston in 1864. In the late 1860s Waterman and his wife Sara Ann Roberts were converted to Spiritualism; his wife gained some fame (and income) as a medium, only to be unmasked and publicly pilloried as a charlatan. In the wake of this and the death of an infant daughter in the summer of 1870, Waterman left his wife and remaining children and moved to New York. In New York, Waterman attended lectures at the American Institute of Phrenology, from which he graduated that same year. Waterman remained keen on phrenology until the end of his life. By 1871 he was promoting the \\"Reactionary Lifter\\", a form of weight training machine. Waterman remarried in 1872, and was back in the insurance business in Boston from 1875 to 1877. A few years later he was on the move again, working as editor for railroad journals \\"The Railroad Gazette\\" and \\"National Car Builder\\". It appears that it was during this period that Waterman began to sell fountain pens, not of his manufacture. Near the end of his life, Waterman started the Waterman Condensing Company to make fruit extracts, but this venture lasted only a few years.

The bandaged lip could indicate an injury caused by manja. Kite running is the practice of running after drifting kites in the sky that have been cut loose in kite fighting. Typically the custom is that the person who captures a cut kite can keep it, so the bigger and more expensive looking the kite, the more people can usually be seen running after it to try to capture it. Kite fights Kite fighting is a popular pastime in the Indian subcontinent throughout the year and during kite flying festivals, and also in Afghanistan, Iran, in Chile and Brazil, and many other places throughout the world. In most cases, the fine string that is used to fly these kites is coated with powdered glass and flyers try to cut the string of the other kites. Running When the loser's kite string is cut, the kite drifts free with the wind until it falls to the ground. Kite running is the practice of running after these cut kites to try to capture them when they come down. Typically the custom is that the person who captures a cut kite can keep it. In cities and towns, the bigger and more expensive looking the kite, the more people can usually be seen running after it to try to capture it as their free prize.\\"Kite Runners Return in Afghanistan\\", WSJ Droves of people of all ages may run after a kite and try to capture it with the help of poles or broken off tree branches with which they try to entangle the loose string trailing with the kite. Running after and capturing these kites is often made more difficult when these drifting kites are taken long distances with the wind or fall atop trees, electric poles and houses over compound walls and fences, or in the middle of or across busy roads and railway lines. Dangers Kite runners endanger their lives by running into the path of oncoming traffic and trains without looking down or fall from trees and buildings which they were trying to scale to get at kites that landed on top while gazing up and running after kites. They may walk around in the middle of congested towns and cities and while gazing up may be dangerously unaware of what is happening on the ground in their immediate surroundings causing injuries and collisions with traffic. There have also been incidents with glass-coated kite strings causing injuries or damage where other people, birds, or electricity cables get entangled with the string. In particular, it is liable to slitting the throats of children participating in the Market Sankranti festival where a popular challenge is to cut other kite strings with your own.

During this time, he led the colony through King George's War. He had an extensive military career throughout his life, during the events of British and French conflict that led to the Seven Years' War (the North American theater is known as the French and Indian War). Biography Mascarene was of French birth of a Huguenot family, driven from France at the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. Subsequently, Mascarene was cared for by relatives in Geneva where he was raised and received his education. About 1706 he moved to England where he received an ensigncy/a badge in the Regiment of French Foot. He was stationed at Portsmouth in 1708 where he was commissioned a lieutenant. By “having the advantage of the French language”, the Governor of Nova Scotia, Samuel Vetch took an interest in Mascarene to use him in relations with French speaking inhabitants of his territory. In 1711, Mascarene was posted at Boston, Massachusetts, where he met and married Elizabeth Perry, by whom he would have four children. In August 1714, Vetch sent Mascarene and Captain Joseph Bennett, with a detachment of troops to Minas, located in the Grand-Pré region of Nova Scotia, Canada. Mascarene’s orders were to be courteous but to collect a tribute worth 6,000 livres from the Acadian inhabitants. Vetch appointed him with a committee, to hear and settle disputes between the Acadians. During the next five years, Mascarene divided his time between Boston and Placentia, Newfoundland, where he was in charge of an infantry company. Mascarene's grandchild William Handfield Snelling, d. 1838, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)Snelling was the Deputy Commissary General at Halifax p. 226 By August 1717, he was commissioned a captain in the newly formed 40th Regiment of Foot and put in charge of a grenadier company. When Port Royal, Nova Scotia was surrendered in October, he “had the honour to take possession of it in mounting the first guard.” Whether by formal education or breadth of interests, he was considered an engineer as well as a regular officer and artilleryman, and a visit to England during this period resulted in his appointment as engineer to the Board of Ordnance. By 1719, he was back in Boston preparing to embark for Annapolis with orders to report on the state of the fortifications there. He was commissioned Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in 1740, until he was replaced by Edward Cornwallis in 1749. In 1751, the new governor, Cornwallis, sent Mascarene to New England to renew the 1726 treaty with the eastern Indians (Norridgewocks, Penobscots, Malecites), and although he corresponded with his Annapolis friends for several years, he did not return to Nova Scotia. In the course of service, he rose to the rank of Major-General. He died poor having only half the pay of his lieutenant- colonelcy to sustain his remaining days in Boston. Nonetheless, he was content with his family of whom he expressed “thanks to Almighty God [to be] in my own house amongst my Children and . . . grandchildren.” (Two of his grandchildren, Hon Foster Hutchinson and William Handfield Snelling, both buried in the Old Burying Ground.)Gentleman's Magazine  Legacy  * namesake of Mascarene Dr., Halifax, Nova Scotia *One of his direct descendants is American actor James Spader.

Range The team plays in the Northern Football Conference, which also includes current teams from Hamilton, Montreal, Oakville, Tri City, North Bay, Sault Ste.

History The Spartans began play in 1954 as Charter Members of the Northern Ontario Rugby-Football Union (predecessor to the NFC) Originally named \\"Hardrocks\\" to reflect the Sudbury's predominant mining industry, the moniker was changed to \\"Spartans\\" in 1967 by then rookie head coach Sid Forster. Forster, a member of the 1953 team who was inducted in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2001, felt the old name sounded more like a street gang than a football team. Suspension of operations Following the death of Forster in 1994, the team struggled to remain competitive. It faced several winless seasons in which it could not finish above .500. During this period, it fielded teams as small as 20 men. On May 14, 2007, the Spartans suspended operations due to an insufficient number of players to safely field a team. The team entered into a two-year \\"leave of absence\\" from the NFC and were hoping to return to NFC action by 2010, however there is no indication of a leader ready to take ownership of the organization.

The Joe Macdonald Youth Football league was flourishing, the high school league bursting at the seams and the Sudbury Gladiators of the Ontario Football Conference had enjoyed a few seasons of success on the gridiron. This resulted in a number of graduated Gladiator players looking to continue playing summer football. The Sudbury Spartan executive were approached by this group and after challenging the football players in Sudbury to commit to playing summer ball by pre- registering for the 2011 NFC season- an abundance of players answered the call and signed up and paid their team fees to play for the Spartans during the upcoming 2011 NFC season. Having answered the call to commit- Spartan President and former head coach Gord Goddard brought together a new Spartan Team Executive and began the process of re-entry into the NFC as a member club. The Sudbury Spartans have been welcomed back into the Northern Football Conference. On Saturday November 20, 2010, the member clubs of the NFC gave the Spartans conditional acceptance back into the league. Official approval will come January 22, 2011 at the NFC Annual General Meeting in Ottawa. New Era Begins On January 22, 2011, the Sudbury Spartans were granted official and full membership back into the Northern Football Conference. After a 4-year leave of absence – the Spartans return to the gridiron for the first time since 2006. The 2011 team will feature a number of Spartan legends returning to the gridiron. The offence will be led by NFC Hall of Famer Dave St Amour, joining St Amour on offence will be returning veterans Brandon Dougan, Al Kawa, Steve Gravel, Walter Wilson, Jordan Cecchetto and Phil Gleason. The defense will be led by NFC Hall of Famer Junior Labrosse alongside veterans Christian Lorenz, Bruno Rocca, Kyle Henri, Yves Filliatrault and Tommy Dube Some exciting new faces to the mix include former North Bay Bulldog Dustin Crowder, Paul Javor, Brett McKnight, Matt Beaulieu, Alex Balloway and Eric Breau. The team has signed 42 players for the 2011 Season already and still looking for more. The 2011 season started with a bang. Sudbury visited its long time southern rivals the Oakville Longhorns and won. When the Spartans returned to their real home, Queens Field, they took another victory against the Toronto Raiders.

She was known for her numerous inventions dealing with sewing machines and sewing technology. Early life Blanchard was born in Portland, Maine on October 25, 1840 to a wealthy family. Her father was Nathaniel Blanchard, a shipowner and businessman; her mother was Phoebe Buxton Blanchard. Helen was one of six children; two other daughters Louise Phobe, and Persis E., and three sons David H., Augustus, and Albus. Helen demonstrated an inventive turn of mind at an early age, but did not receive her first patent until she was over thirty, after the fall of her father's business. There is no indication that she received any mechanical or technical education, despite her patents being involved mostly in these subjects.Stanley, Autumn. Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers U, 1995. Print. First inventions and move to Boston – 1870s Her father suffered financial losses as a result of the business panic of 1866, resulting in the loss of the family homestead. Nathaniel died, leaving his family with financial troubles. Helen Blanchard moved to Boston, Massachusetts and patented several inventions relating to sewing machines in 1873 and 1875. This included the Blanchard over-seaming-machine, which could simultaneously sew and trim knitted fabrics. Philadelphia and New York – late 1870s–1890s After developing techniques for zigzag stitching and over seaming, Blanchard moved to Philadelphia, where she established the Blanchard Overseaming Company of Philadelphia to market her inventions in the late 1870s or early 1880s. She also founded the Blanchard Hosiery Machine Company in 1882. She moved to New York in the early 1890s, and continued to patent a variety of inventions, including a pencil sharpener (U.S. Patent No. 304,900 issued September 9, 1884) and a hat sewing machine. Later life and legacy Having profited from her commercial ventures, Blanchard was able to buy back the family homestead in Portland, and moved back there in 1901. She continued to patent inventions until suffering a stroke in 1916. She died in Providence, RI, in 1922 and is buried in the family plot in Portland's Evergreen Cemetery. . It is unclear what became of her property and wealth after her death. However, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. Patents Helen Blanchard received 28 patents over about 45 years, 22 of which involved sewing and sewing machines. Many of these inventions have been referenced by other inventors in their own designs. 1873-Improvement in Sewing MachinesBlanchard, Helen A. Improvement in Sewing Machines. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US141987. 19 Aug. 1873. Print. *This invention created a way to form a buttonhole stitch, or a zig-zag stitch, that when used to close a seam gave strength to the piece. The stitch could be varied in several different ways, such as varying the depth of the needle. The original sewing machine with this adaptation is currently housed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. 1875- Improvement in Elastic Seams for GarmentsBlanchard, Helen A. Improvement in Elastic Seams for Garments. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US162019. 13 Apr. 1875. Print. *This invention is a method of stitching that produces a strong elastic stitch with minimal alterations to the material used in the process besides adjusting the tension of the fabric. 1875- Improvement in Elastic Goring for ShoesBlanchard, Helen A. Improvement in Elastic Goring for Shoes. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US167732. 14 Sept. 1875. Print. *This invention is a way to strengthen shoes by reinforcing the goring keeping the pieces of shoe together. A series of rows of stitches made from one strand of regular thread and one rubber thread is used to create a type of goring that could withstand more movement compared to the previous method. 1876- Improvement in Welted and Covered SeamsBlanchard, Helen A. Improvement in Welted and Covered Seams. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US174764. 14 Mar. 1876. Print. *This invention is a method for which two edges of material, once stitched together to form a seam, could be made flat. This could be done by either inserting a welt or by sewing a strip over the seam. 1883- Spool CaseBlanchard, Helen A. Spool-Case. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US276344. 24 Apr. 1883. Print. *This invention is a simple cover for spools of silk, cotton, thread, or other material, that protects the spool from becoming dirty, damaged, or unwound. 1893- Method of Securing Reeds or Cords to the Edges of MaterialBlanchard, Helen A. METHOD OF SECURING REEDS OR CORDS TO THE EDGES OF MATERIALS. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US496929. 9 May 1893. Print. *This invention is a method of securing reeds or cords to the edges of materials, especially securing reeds to hat sweatbands. This is done by folding the edges of the material around the reed or cord before sewing. 1893- Sewing-NeedleBlanchard, Helen A. Sewing-Needle. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US500556. 4 July 1893. Print. *This invention is an improvement to the sewing needle, by making it possible to thread the needle with one hand for efficiency. This is done by adding a latch that allows the needle to open, making it possible for the user to place the thread in the slot instead of threading it through a hole. 1894- Surgical NeedleBlanchard, Helen A. Surgical Needle. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US527263 A. 9 Oct. 1894. Print. *This invention is an improvement to previous surgical needles. The needle has a lancet point which allows it to pierce skin easily with minimal resistance and therefore less pain to the patient. The notch on the backside of the needle allows the thread to disconnect from the needle by just withdrawing from the skin. 1900- Sewing Machine NeedleBlanchard, Helen A. Sewing Machine Needle. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US659999. 16 Oct. 1900. Print. *This invention is a type of needle used in sewing machines where one or more thread is used to form stitches. The needle has the ability to pierce the goods to be sewed, and contains a notch that supplies another thread to create the stitch. 1901- Seam for Sewed ArticlesBlanchard, Helen A. SEAM FOR SEWED ARTICLES. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US683902. 8 Oct. 1901. Print. *This invention is a way to connect two edges of material, specifically knit fabrics, and over edging. This method uses a series of loops made from a single thread going through the two edges of the material to create a seam. 1901- Hat Sewing MachineBlanchard, Helen A. Hat-Sewing Machine. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US684176. 8 Oct. 1901. Print. *This invention is an adaptation to the sewing machine that allows it to stitch a common chain stitch with one thread to be used to sew sweatbands and strips of linen onto the inside edge of the hat. Previously, this work had been done by hand, so this machine increased the rate of production by simplifying the work needed to be done. 1914- Method of Selvage-SewingBlanchard, Helen A. Method of Selvage-Sewing. Helen A Blanchard, assignee. Patent US1089816. 10 Mar. 1914. Print. *This invention is a method for primarily bringing together the edges of selvage knit goods, but can also be used with other fabric for decorative uses. This method helps smooth out curls in fabric and helps create a flat seam that was not previously possible. See also *Margaret E.

The book represents the author's theorizing on topics impacting human liberty. Rothbard looks beyond conventional left-right thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management. The book's title comes from the lead essay, which argues that egalitarian theory always results in a politics of statist control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself. According to Rothbard in this lead essay, statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with a Romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature, an ideal which cannot and should not be achieved, according to Rothbard. The implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics, child rights, environmentalism, feminism, foreign policy, redistribution and others. Roy Childs writes in the Foreword: > For until Rothbard's work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty, > the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully > appreciated and, moreover, the unity and true historical context of > libertarianism will not even be fully grasped.

The Intel MCS-96 is a family of microcontrollers (MCU) commonly used in embedded systems. The family is often referred to as the 8xC196 family, or 80196, the most popular MCU in the family. These MCUs are commonly used in hard disk drives, modems, printers, pattern recognition and motor control. In 2007, Intel announced the discontinuance of the entire MCS-96 family of microcontrollers. Intel noted that \\"There are no direct replacements for these components and a redesign will most likely be necessary.\\"http://www.intel.com/design/support/faq/microcontrollers/96_components.htm  History  An Intel A8097 CPGA. An Intel C8095 in ceramic DIP-48 package The MCS-96 family originated as a commercial derivative of the Intel 8061, the first processor in the Ford EEC-IV engine controller family. Differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory interface bus, the 8061's M-Bus being a 'burst-mode' bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices. There were also considerable differences in the I/O peripherals of the two parts – the 8061 had 8 HSI (pulse-measurement) inputs, 10 HSO (pulse-generation) outputs entirely separated from the HSI pins, and a non-sampling 10-bit ADC with more channels than the 8096 had. Many differences between the EEC-IV and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce I/O pin count in favor of using the pins for a more conventional memory interface bus. The 8096 also had on-chip program memory lacking in the 8061. Ford created the Ford Microelectronics facility in Colorado Springs in 1982 to propagate the EEC-IV family, develop other custom circuits for use in automobiles, and to explore the gallium arsenide integrated circuit market. Parts in that family included the 8065, which incorporated a memory controller allowing it to address a megabyte of memory. The family of microcontrollers are 16-bit, however they do have some 32-bit operations. The processors operate at 16, 20, 25, and 50 MHz, and is separated into 3 smaller families. The HSI (high speed input) / HSO (high speed output) family operates at 16 and 20 MHz, and the EPA (event processor array) family operates at all of the frequencies. The main features of the MCS-96 family include a large on-chip memory, Register-to-register architecture, three operand instructions, bus controller to allow 8 or 16 bit bus widths, and direct flat addressability of large blocks (256 or more) of registers.  809x/839x/879x family  The 809x/839x/879x ICs are members of the MCS-96 family. Although MCS-96 is thought of as the 8x196 family, the 8095 was the first member of the family. Later the 8096, 8097, 8395, 8396, and 8397 were added to the family. The Intel 809x/839x/879x ICs are 12 MHz, 16 bit microcontrollers. The microchip is based on a 5 V, 3 micrometre, HMOS process. The microcontroller has an on-chip ALU, 4 channel 10 bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), 8 bit pulse width modulator (PWM), watchdog timer, 4 16bit software timers, hardware multiply and divide, and 8 KB of on-chip ROM. The 8095 is ROMless and has five 8-bit high speed I/O, full duplex serial port, as well as an ADC input and PWM output. The 8095 comes in a 48-pin Ceramic DIP package, and the following part number variants. C8095-90  8x196/8xC196 family  The MCS-96 family is generally thought of as the 80C196 IC, even though the family includes the 809x/839x/879x microcontrollers, which came first. Members of this sub-family are 80C196, 83C196, 87C196 and 88C196.  Other vendors  As of 2017, microcontrollers using the MCS-96 architecture are still being manufactured by NIIET in Voronesh, Russia, as the 1874 series of integrated circuits. This includes a radiation-hardened device with a Spacewire interface under the designation 1874VE7T (). Cobham (formerly Aeroflex) manufactures another radiation-hardened MCS-96 microcontroller.

It was a basal titanosauriform which lived in what is now Gansu, China.  History  Hind view of skeleton, Henan Geological Museum The type species, Huanghetitan liujiaxiaensis, was described by You et al. in 2006. It is known from fragmentary materials including two caudal vertebrae, an almost complete sacrum, rib fragments, and the left shoulder girdle, and was discovered in the eastern part of the Lanzhou Basin (Hekou Group) in the Gansu Province in 2004. A second species, H. ruyangensis, was described in 2007 from the Aptian-Albian Haoling Formation of Ruyang County, China (Henan Province). A recent cladistic analysis has found that this species is (or more likely) not related to H. liujiaxiaensis and even requires a new genus name.  Size  It is known from a partial vertebral column and several ribs, the size of which (the largest approaches 3 m (10 ft)) indicate it had among the deepest body cavities of any known dinosaur. This second species, along with its local relatives Daxiatitan and Ruyangosaurus, is one of the biggest dinosaurs ever found in Asia, and possibly one of the largest in the world.Jinyou Mo, Jincheng Li, Yunchuan Ling, Eric Buffetaut, Suravech Suteethorn Varavud, Suteethorne Haiyan Tong, Gilles Cuny, Romain Amiot & Xing Xu (2020).

Paul suggested that the dorsal rib of Huanghetitan ruyangensis is about the same length as Patagotitan's, and its sacrum may be similar in length, possibly suggesting a similar mass range of 45–55 tonnes (49.6–60.6 short tons). In 2007, Lü Junchang et al. created a new family for Huanghetitan, the Huangetitanidae, but this family found to be polyphyletic by Mannion et al.

Historically, the term has been used primarily in the United States to describe a person of color or of multiracial ancestry who assimilated into the white majority to escape the legal and social conventions of racial segregation and discrimination. In the United States =Passing for white= James Weldon Johnson, author of the Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man Although anti-miscegenation laws outlawing racial intermarriage existed in America as early as 1664, there were no laws preventing the rape of enslaved women. For generations, enslaved black mothers bore mixed-race children who were deemed \\"mulattos\\", \\"quadroons\\", \\"octoroons\\" or even \\"hexadecaroons\\" based on their percentage of \\"white blood\\". Although these mixed-race people were often half white or more, institutions of hypodescent and the 20th-century one drop rule in some ⁠ ⁠— ⁠ particularly Southern ⁠ ⁠— ⁠states classified them as black and therefore, inferior, particularly after slavery became a racial caste. But there were other mixed-race people who were born to unions or marriages in colonial Virginia between free white women and African or African-American men, free, indentured, or slave, and became ancestors to many free families of color in the early decades of the US, as documented by Paul Heinegg in his Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware , Baltimore, MD: Geneaological Publishing Co., 1995-2000 Mixed-race African Americans sometimes used their racially ambiguous appearance (and often majority European ancestry) in order to pass as white and evade the restrictions against them to seek better lives. For some people, passing as white and using their whiteness to uplift other black people was the best way to undermine the system that relegated black people to a lower position in society. These same people that were able to pass as white were sometimes known for leaving the African American community and getting an education, later to return and assist with racial uplifting. Although reasons behind passing are deeply individual, the history of African Americans passing as white can be categorized by the following time periods: the antebellum era, post-emancipation, Reconstruction through Jim Crow, and present day. = Antebellum America = During the antebellum period, passing as white was a means of escaping slavery. Once they left the plantation, escaped slaves who could pass as white found safety in their perceived whiteness. To pass as white was to pass as free. However, once they gained their freedom, most escaped slaves intended to return to blackness - passing as white was a temporary disguise used to gain freedom. Once they had escaped, their racial ambiguity could be a safeguard to their freedom. If an escaped slave was able to pass as white, they were less likely to be caught and returned to their plantation. If they were caught, white-passing slaves such as Jane Morrison could sue for their freedom, using their white appearance as justification for emancipation. = Post-Emancipation = Post-emancipation, passing as white was no longer a means to obtain freedom. As passing shifted from a necessity to an option, it fell out of favor in the black community. Author Charles W. Chestnutt, who was born free in Ohio as a mixed-race African American, explored circumstances for persons of color in the South after emancipation, for instance, for a formerly enslaved woman who marries a white- passing man shortly after the conclusion of Civil War. Some fictional exploration coalesced around the figure of the \\"tragic mulatta\\", a woman whose future is compromised by her being mixed race and able to pass for white.  Reconstruction through Jim Crow  During the Reconstruction era, black people slowly gained some of the constitutional rights of which they were deprived during slavery. Although they would not secure \\"full\\" constitutional equality for another century until after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, reconstruction promised African Americans legal equality for the first time. Abolishing slavery did not abolish racism. During Reconstruction whites tried to enforce white supremacy, in part through the rise of Ku Klux Klan chapters, rifle clubs and later paramilitary insurgent groups such as the Red Shirts. Passing was used by some African Americans to evade segregation. Those who were able to pass as white often engaged in tactical passing or passing as white in order to get a job, go to school, or to travel. Outside of these situations, \\"tactical passers\\" still lived as black people, and for this reason, tactical passing is also referred to as \\"9 to 5 passing.\\" The writer and literary critic Anatole Broyard saw his father pass in order to get work after his Louisiana Creole family moved north to Brooklyn before World War II. This idea of crossing the color line at different points in one's life is explored in James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. But the narrator closes the novel by saying \\"I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage\\", meaning that he regrets trading in his blackness for whiteness. The idea that passing as white was a rejection of blackness was common at the time and remains so to the present time. People also chose to pass for white during Jim Crow and beyond. The US civil rights leader Walter Francis White (who was blond-haired, blue- eyed, and very fair) was of mixed-race, mostly European ancestry: 27 of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents were white; the other five were classified as black and had been slaves. He grew up with his parents and family in Atlanta in the black community and identified with it. He served as the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1929 until his death in 1955. In the earlier stages of his career, he conducted investigations in the South, during which he sometimes passed as white in order to gather information more freely on lynchings and hate crimes, and to protect himself in socially hostile environments. In the 20th century, Krazy Kat comics creator George Herriman was a Louisiana Creole cartoonist born to mulatto parents, who claimed Greek heritage throughout his adult life. The 20th-century writer and critic Anatole Broyard was a Louisiana Creole who chose to pass for white in his adult life in New York City and Connecticut. He wanted to create an independent writing life and rejected being classified as a black writer. In addition, he did not identify with northern urban black people, whose experiences had been much different from his as a child in New Orleans' Creole community. He married an American woman of European descent. His wife and many of his friends knew he was partly black in ancestry. His daughter Bliss Broyard did not find out until after her father's death. In 2007, she published a memoir that traced her exploration of her father's life and family mysteries entitled One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life: A Story of Race and Family Secrets. The rise of the civil rights movement and the enforcement of voting rights for African Americans, particularly in the South, meant that political leaders called on all African Americans to unify in order to maximize their power. =2000 to present= Passing as white in the 21st-century is more controversial: it is often seen as a rejection of blackness, family and culture. A well-publicized modern example of \\"racial passing\\" is Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who worked for African-American rights and tried to pass as African American. She worked as a civil rights activist. Her attempt at passing was to gain the support of the black community. She became president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP before her parents identified her as white. =Passing as Indigenous Americans= Portrait of Englishman Archibald Belaney, who 'reinvented himself' as Grey Owl.

The author and environmentalist Grey Owl was born in United Kingdom as a white man named Archibald Belaney; he made a life in Canada and claimed to be a First Nations person. When asked to explain his European appearance, he lied and claimed he was half Scottish and half Apache. Belaney performed what he said were Ojibwe cultural practices and wilderness skills, and adopted an anachronistic and stereotypical lifestyle, as part of a persona which he was successful in marketing to non-Native audiences.Donald B.

To try to protect Native American artists from the claims of non-Native impersonators, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 was passed in the United States. It requires any visual artist claiming to be a Native American artist to be either an enrolled member of a state or federally recognized tribe, or for a recognized tribe to designate the artist as a tribal artisan. In academia, due to non-tribal colleges' and universities' reliance on self-identification of tribal identity, non-Native people have sometimes passed as Native Americans. Professor and activist Ward Churchill, who advocated for American Indian rights, claimed to be alternately Cherokee, Muscogee Creek, and Métis.

She was Italian-American but widely mistaken for African-American due to her appearance, leading to both of them receiving death threats from white supremacists. Rachel Dolezal in 2015 Civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal, then president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, claimed in a February 2015 profile to have been born in a \\"Montana tepee\\" and have hunted for food with her family as a child \\"with bows and arrows\\". She primarily identified as African American and had established herself as an activist in Spokane. In 2015 Dolezal's mother disputed her daughter's accounts, saying that the family's ancestry was Czech, Swedish, and German, with \\"faint traces\\" of Native American heritage. She also denied various claims made by her daughter about her life, including having lived in Africa when young, although the parents did live there for a time after Dolezal had left home. Dolezal ultimately resigned from her position at the Spokane NAACP chapter. In 2015, Vijay Chokalingam, the brother of Indian- American entertainer Mindy Kaling, told CNN that he had pretended to be black years before in order to take advantage of affirmative action to be admitted into medical school. The medical school issued a statement that Chokalingam's grades and scores met the criteria for acceptance at the time, and race had played no factor in his admission. John Roland Redd was an African-American musician born and raised in Missouri. In the 1950s he assumed a new identity, claiming to be an Indian named Korla Pandit and fabricating a history of birth in New Delhi, India to a Brahmin priest and a French opera singer. He established a career in this exotic persona, described as an \\"Indian Liberace\\". Two years after his death in 1999, his true ethnic identity was revealed in an article by Los Angeles magazine editor R. J. Smith. In September 2020, after Black Latino scholars confronted her, African History Professor and author Jessica Krug admitted she had been falsely passing as African-American. As an activist, Krug had also been using the alias \\"Jessica La Bombalera\\".BBC News September 4,2020 Other countries For Jews in Nazi Germany, passing as \\"Aryan\\" or white and non-Jewish was a means of escaping persecution. There were three ways to avoid being shipped off to the death camps: run, hide or pass. No option was perfect, and all carried the risk of getting caught. People who could not run away but wanted to maintain a life without hiding attempted to pass as \\"aryan.\\" People who were \\"visibly Jewish\\" could try to alter their appearance to become \\"aryan\\", while other Jewish people with more ambiguous features could pass into the \\"aryan\\" ideal more easily. In these attempts to pass as \\"aryan\\", Jewish people altered their appearance by dying their hair blonde and even attempting to reverse circumcisions. Edith Hahn Beer was Jewish and passed as \\"Aryan\\"; she survived the Holocaust by living with and marrying a Nazi officer. Hahn-Beer wrote a memoir called: The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust. Another such example is Stella Kübler, a Jewish collaborator who initially attempted to hide her Jewish background. Examples of racial passing have been used by people to assimilate into groups other than European. Marie Lee Bandura, who grew up as part of the Qayqayt First Nation in New Westminster, British Columbia, was orphaned and believed she was the last of her people. She moved to Vancouver's Chinatown, married a Chinese man, and raised her four children as Chinese. One day she told her daughter Rhonda Larrabee about her heritage: \\"I will tell you once, but you must never ask me again.\\" In Latin America, generational acculturation and assimilation took place via intermarriage. Medium-brown offspring of even dark parents were no longer \\"black\\", but were labeled with any of a half-dozen terms denoting class as much as skin tone. Descendants who were European-looking were accepted as white. Patrick O'Brian (1914 – 2000), born Richard Patrick Russ, an English novelist and translator, best known for his Aubrey–Maturin series of sea novels set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, was for many years presumed by reviewers and journalists to be Irish,For example, Lord Dunsany referred to The Last Pool as \\"this charming book by an Irish sportsman\\" in a 1950 Observer review (Tolstoy, 324) and William Waldegrave, reviewing The Wine-Dark Sea in 1993, was still referring to O'Brian's supposed \\"Irish, French and English childhood\\" (William Waldegrave, Patrick O'Brian, reprinted in Patrick O'Brian, The Reverse of the Medal, HarperCollins reprinted 2003) and he took no steps to correct the impression, until a 1999 exposé in The Daily Telegraph made public the facts of his ancestry, original name and first marriage, provoking considerable critical media comment. Treatment in popular culture =Literature= * Frank J. Webb's 1857 novel, The Garies and Their Friends, explores the choices in the racist antebellum north (Philadelphia) of three mixed-race characters who could pass for white: George Winston, who opts to leave the United States rather than be subjected to discriminatory laws; Emily Garie, who marries into the coloured society that she identifies with and defends; and her brother, Clarence Gary, who secretly passes after attending a white boarding school.

The husband, Armand, sends Désirée and the baby away, implying she is of mixed race. The final scene reveals that Armand knew that he was of mixed- race ancestry. * Mark Twain's 1894 novel, The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson, is a scathing satire of passing in the antebellum south. Roxy, a slave, is black; in order to avoid being sold down the river, she decides to switch her own baby (who is black) with a white child she is caring for. Her baby Tom, who passes for white, is raised as a spoiled aristocrat, but when his true identity becomes known, as the child of a slave and thus born into slavery, he is sold down the river. * Writing in the late 19th century, Charles W. Chesnutt explored issues of mixed-race people passing for white in several of his short stories and novels set in the South after the American Civil War.

The history of Indigenous Australians began at least 65,000 years ago when humans first populated the Australian continental landmasses. This article covers the history of Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, two broadly defined groups which each include other sub-groups defined by language and culture. The origin of the first humans to populate the southern continent and the pieces of land which became islands as ice receded and sea levels rose remains a matter of conjecture and debate. Some anthropologists believe they could have arrived as a result of the earliest human migrations out of Africa. Although they likely migrated to the territory later named Australia through Southeast Asia, Aboriginal Australians are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Melanesian population, although Torres Strait Islander people do have a genetic link to some Melanesian populations. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage. Estimates of the number of people living in Australia at the time that colonisation began in 1788, who belonged to a range of diverse groups, vary from 300,000 to a million, and upper estimates place the total population as high as 1.25 million. A cumulative population of 1.6 billion people has been estimated to have lived in Australia over 65,000 years prior to British colonisation. The regions of heaviest Aboriginal population were the same temperate coastal regions that are currently the most heavily populated. In the early 1900s it was commonly believed that the Aboriginal population of Australia was leading toward extinction. The population shrank from those present when colonisation began in New South Wales in 1788, to 50,000 in 1930. This drastic reduction in numbers has been attributed to outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases to which the Indigenous peoples had no immunity,D. Hopkins, Princes and Peasants, Chicago, 1983, p. 207; Judy Campbell, Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780–1880, Melbourne, 2002, pp. 10, 39–50 but other sources have described the extent of frontier clashes and in some cases, deliberate killings of Aboriginal peoples. Post-colonisation, the coastal Indigenous populations were soon absorbed, depleted or forced from their lands; the traditional aspects of Aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the Great Sandy Desert where European settlement has been sparse. The greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the Murray River valley in particular. Although the Aboriginal Tasmanians were almost driven to extinction (and once thought to be so), other Aboriginal Australian peoples maintained successful communities throughout Australia. Migration to Australia It is believed that the first early human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between Sulawesi and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via Timor.Lourandos, Harry. Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory (Cambridge University Press, 1997) p.81 The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians is still unknown, but recent findings have suggested a time around 65,000 years BP. As of 2018 Madjedbebe, in the Northern Territory, is the oldest known site showing the presence of humans in Australia. Archaeological excavations conducted by Clarkson et al. (2017) yielded evidence to suggest that Madjedbebe was first occupied by humans possibly by 65,000 +/- 6,000 years ago and at least by 50,000 years ago. \\"The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50–60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods\\" The date sets the minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, and by extension for the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa. Only Africa has older physical evidence of habitation by modern humans.The rock shelters at Madjedbebe (about inland from the present coast) and of Nauwalabila I ( further south) show evidence of used pieces of ochre used by artists 60,000 years ago. In 2007, using OSL, Rhys Jones dated stone tools found here as from 53,000–60,000 years ago. Near Penrith in New South Wales, since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools have been found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP. More recent dating of the same strata in 1987 and 2003 has corroborated these dates. A 48,000 BCE date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using thermoluminescence. A large number of sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 38,000 BCE, leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique. Radiocarbon dating is limited to a maximum age of around 40,000 years. Some estimates have been given as widely as from 30,000 to 68,000 BCE. Earlier dates are requiring new techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and the evidence for an earlier date of arrival is growing. Charles Dortch dated finds on Rottnest Island, Western Australia at 70,000 years BP in 1994.Dortch, C.E. and Hesp, P.A. 1994. \\"Rottnest Island artifacts and palaeosols in the context of Greater Swan Region prehistory\\" (Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia 77:23–32) (Thermoluminescence dating of the Jinmium site in the Northern Territory initially suggested a date of about 116,000 (+/- 12,000) BCE;Early human occupation of northern Australia: archaeology and thermoluminescence dating of Jinmium rock-shelter, Northern Territory by R.L.K. Fullagar, D.M. Price & L.M. Head in Antiquity Vol 70 Number 270, December, 1996. however, this was later found to be mistaken and the site only 10,000 years old.) There is also evidence of a change in fire régimes in Australia, drawn from reef deposits in Queensland, between 70 and 100,000 years ago,Flannery, Tim \\"The Future Eaters\\" and the integration of human genomic evidence from various parts of the world also supports a date of before 60,000 years for the arrival of Australian Aboriginal people in the continent.Oppenheimer, Stephen, (2004),\\"Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World\\"(Constable and Robinson; New Ed)http://[www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/]Oppenheimer, Stephen \\"The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa\\"(Carroll & Graf Publishers)() Humans reached Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last glacial maximum. After the seas rose about 12,000 years ago and covered the land bridge, the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers.Mulvaney, J. and Kamminga, J., (1999), Prehistory of Australia. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington. Short-statured Aboriginal tribes inhabited the rainforests of North Queensland, of which the best known group is probably the Tjapukai of the Cairns area.Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes: Tjapukai (QLD) These rainforest people, collectively referred to as Barrineans, were once considered to be a relic of an earlier wave of Negrito migration to the Australian continent, but this \\"Aboriginal pygmy\\" theory has been discredited. Mungo Man, whose remains were discovered in 1974 near Lake Mungo in New South Wales, is the oldest human yet found in Australia. Although the exact age of Mungo Man is in dispute, the best consensus is that he is at least 40,000 years old. Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated, based on stratigraphic association, to be about 50,000 years old. Since Lake Mungo is in south- eastern Australia, many archaeologists have concluded that humans must have arrived in north-west Australia at least several thousand years earlier. =Changes around 4,000 years ago= The dingo reached Australia about 4,000 years ago, and around the same time there were changes in language, with the Pama-Nyungan language family spreading over most of the mainland, and stone tool technology, with the use of smaller tools. Human contact has thus been inferred, and genetic data of two kinds have been proposed to support a gene flow from India to Australia: firstly, signs of South Asian components in Aboriginal Australian genomes, reported on the basis of genome-wide SNP data; and secondly, the existence of a Y chromosome (male) lineage, designated haplogroup C∗, with the most recent common ancestor around 5,000 years ago. A 2013 study by researchers at the Max Planck Institute led by Irina Pugach, the result of large-scale genotyping, indicated that Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous peoples of New Guinea and the Mamanwa, an indigenous people of the southern Philippines are closely related, having diverged from a common origin approximately 36,000 years ago. The same study shows that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11% Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia, indicating a substantial gene flow between Indian populations and Northern Australia occurred around 4,230 years ago. Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time, suggesting there may have been migration from India.Aboriginal genes suggest Indian migration Australian Geographic 15 January 2013 However, a 2016 study in Current Biology by Anders Bergström et al. excluded the Y chromosome as providing evidence for recent gene flow from India into Australia. The study authors sequenced 13 Aboriginal Australian Y chromosomes using recent advances in gene sequencing technology, investigating their divergence times from Y chromosomes in other continents, including comparing the haplogroup C chromosomes. The authors concluded that, although this does not disprove the presence the presence any Holocene gene flow or non-genetic influences from South Asia at that time, and the appearance of the dingo does provide strong evidence for external contacts, the evidence overall is consistent with a complete lack of gene flow, and points to indigenous origins for the technological and linguistic changes. Gene flow across the island-dotted -wide Torres Strait, is both geographically plausible and demonstrated by the data, although at this point it could not be determined from this study when within the last 10,000 years it may have occurred – newer analytical techniques have the potential to address such questions. Early history =Geography= The shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago, as sea levels were rising, showing some of the human archaeological sites When the north-west of Australia, which is closest to Asia, was first occupied, the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, by which time the Aboriginal people had settled the entire continent, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice age. By the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to around 140 metres below its present level. Australia was connected to New Guinea and the Kimberley region of Western Australia was separated from Southeast Asia (Wallacea) by a strait only approximately 90 km wide. Rainfall was 40% to 50% lower than modern levels, depending on region, while the lower CO2 levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water for photosynthesis.J.G.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 39, L22702, 5 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2012GL053916 http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053916.shtml Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia Southeast of the Kimberley, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to northern Tasmania the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered largely by extreme deserts and sand dunes. It is believed that during this period no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savanna, while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of Queensland. Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time, and there would seem to have been scattered \\"refugia\\" in which the modern vegetation types and Aboriginal populations were able to survive. Corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact, and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called \\"Songlines\\" today.Jonathan Adams Australasia during The Last 150,000 Years Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National LaboratoryM.H.Monroe Last Glacial Maximum in Australia Australia: The Land Where Time Began: A biography of the Australian continent With the end of the ice age, strong rains returned, until around 5,500 years ago, when the wet season cycle in the north ended, bringing with it a megadrought that lasted 1,500 years. The return of reliable rains around 4,000 years BP gave Australia its current climate. Following the Ice Age, Aboriginal people around the coast, from Arnhem Land, the Kimberley and the southwest of Western Australia, all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the Ice Age. It was this event that isolated the Tasmanian Aboriginal people on their island, and probably led to the extinction of Aboriginal cultures on the Bass Strait Islands and Kangaroo Island in South Australia. In the interior, the end of the Ice Age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semi-desert areas by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the Pama–Nyungan language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving circumcision. There has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Western Province, Torres Strait Islanders and the Aboriginal people in Cape York.Flood, Josephine (1994), \\"Archaeology of the Dreamtime\\" (Angus & Robertson; 2Rev Ed)() The Aboriginal Australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment. There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment. One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the marsupial megafauna (also see Australian megafauna). Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna. Others claim that, because the megafauna were large and slow, they were easy prey for human hunters. A third possibility is that human modification of the environment, particularly through the use of fire, indirectly led to their extinction. Oral history demonstrates \\"the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians\\" for at least 10,000 years. This is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean shorelines; oral records of megafauna; and comets. =Ecology= woomera in the Eora language), and two examples of boomerangs. Boomerangs could be used for hunting (most were non- returning), or purely for music and ceremony. The introduction of the dingo, possibly as early as 3500 BCE, showed that contact with South East Asian peoples continued, as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of Thailand. This contact was not just one-way, as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates. Dingoes began and evolved in Asia. The earliest known dingo-like fossils are from Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand (dated at 5500 years BP) and from north Vietnam (5000 years BP). According to skull morphology, these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves (prime candidates were the pale footed (or Indian) wolf Canis lupus pallipes and the Arabian wolf Canis lupus arabs) and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand.Corbett, Laurie (1995), \\"The Dingo: in Australia and Asia\\" Most scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of fire- stick farming that was responsible for these extinctions.Flannery, Tim \\"The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People\\" (Grove Press)() Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for \\"at least 17,000 years\\". Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes: to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey; to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires; to make travel easier; to eliminate pests; for ceremonial purposes; for warfare and just to \\"clean up country.\\" There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which this burning led to large-scale changes in vegetation patterns. =Food= Aboriginal grinding stones – a pestle and mortar –, vital in making flours for bush bread. Aboriginal women were expert at making bread from a variety of seasonal grains and nuts. Aboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, boomerang, or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent trackers and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell. Fish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. Both Torres Strait Island populations and mainland aborigines were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods.Gammage, Bill (October 2011). The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines made Australia. Allen & Unwin. pp. 281–304. . Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights. coolamon lined with paperbark and a digging stick. This woven basket style is from Northern Australia. Baskets were used for collecting fruits, corms, seeds and even water – some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight. In present-day Victoria, for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near Hamilton in the territory of the Djab Wurrung, which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see Gunditjmara). A primary tool used in hunting is the spear, launched by a woomera or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a Throwing Stick), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo. On mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo and the Short-finned eel were domesticated, however domestic pigs and cassowaries were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2002). Ratites and Tinamous. Oxford University Press. The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, kangaroo, emu, wombats, goanna, snakes, birds, many insects such as honey ants, Bogong moths and witchetty grubs. Many varieties of plant foods such as taro, coconuts, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten. =Culture= Lomandra, a plant used by Aboriginal Australians for weaving Permanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were semi-nomadic, moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of middens, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. Rock painting at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent rock paintings found in the Sydney basin area which date to around 5,000 years. Harry Lourandos has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in stone tool technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo. Many Indigenous communities also have a very complex kinship structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific moiety. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as corroborees) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented inbreeding in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups. Impact of British colonisation =1788–1900, European settlement= A 19th-century engraving of an Aboriginal Australian encampment, showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of Australia at the time of European settlement. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook wrote that he had claimed the east coast of Australia for what was then the Kingdom of Great Britain and named it New South Wales, while on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula. However, it seems that no such claim was made when Cook was in Australia. Cook was not authorized to make such a claim and Joseph Banks, who was standing beside Cook, does not mention the event. Furthermore, Cook's purported declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788 with the arrival of Governor Phillip and the First Fleet. The first apparent consequence of British settlement appeared in April 1789 when a disease, which was probably smallpox, struck the Aborigines about Port Jackson. Thereafter, other European epidemic diseases arrived such as chickenpox, influenza and measles, which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline. The second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought venereal disease, to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and substance abuse has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since. Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers recorded their existence. Diseases Deadly infectious diseases like smallpox, influenza and tuberculosis were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths. Smallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population. In April 1789, a major outbreak of smallpox killed large numbers of Indigenous Australians between Hawkesbury River, Broken Bay, and Port Hacking. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the First Fleet, it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive hunters and gatherers dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve. Lieutenant William Bradley recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White, who believed they were suffering from \\"slight inflammatory complaints\\".John White, Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with Sixty-five Plates of Non Descript Animals, Birds, Lizards, Serpents, Curious Cones of Trees and Other Natural Productions, London, 1795, p. 4. Some commentators, such as Judy Campbell, have suggested that Makasar fishermen accidentally brought smallpox to Australia's north and the virus travelled south. However, given that the spread of the disease depends on high population densities, and the fact that those who succumbed were soon incapable of walking, such an outbreak was unlikely to have spread across the desert trade routes. A more likely source of the disease was the \\"variolas matter\\" Surgeon John White brought with him on the First Fleet, although it is unknown how this may have been spread. (Includes further citations) It has been speculated that the vials were either accidentally or intentionally released as a \\"biological weapon\\". Some researchers, such as Seth CarusDistinguished Research Fellow, Center for the Study of WMD, National Defense University, Ft. McNair, Washington. and Chris Warren suggest that the infection was deliberate. In 2014, writing in Journal of Australian Studies, Christopher Warren concluded that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox, possibly without informing Governor Phillip, but conceded in his conclusion that \\"today's evidence only provides for a balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted.\\" Conflicts On the mainland, prolonged conflict followed the frontier of European settlement. In 1834, John Dunmore Lang wrote: \\"There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains.\\"Lang, 1834. History of NSW p.38 In 1790, an Aboriginal leader Pemulwuy in Sydney resisted the Europeans, waging a guerrilla-style warfare on the settlers in a series of wars known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, which spanned 26 years, from 1790 to 1816. In 1838, twenty eight Aboriginal people were killed at the Myall Creek massacre; seven of the convict settlers responsible, six white men and one African man, were tried, convicted and hanged for the murders. Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the Noongar of south-western Australia, led by Yagan, who was killed in 1833. The Kalkadoon of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at Coniston in the Territory of Central Australia in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000–20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as Henry Reynolds. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country- wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths.Windshuttle, The Fabrication of the Aboriginal Death Toll', in Quadrant, November 2000, p. 21. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 white people were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence. By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement. The Palawa, or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a genocidal policy, in the form of the \\"Black War\\". Other historians dispute this. Geoffrey Blainey wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: \\"Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.\\"Blainey, Geoffrey : A Land Half Won, Macmillan, South Melbourne, Vic., 1980, p 75 Josephine Flood wrote: \\"The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones.\\"Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006 , p89 Historian Keith Windschuttle also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803–47, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict.Windschuttle, Keith (2002). The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847. Sydney: Macleay Press. , pp351-397 Another scholar, H. A. Willis, has subsequently disputed Windschuttle's figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 1803–34 alone, with possibly another 145 killed during the same period.Cited in Josephine Flood, 2006, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, () p.86. Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates.Flood, Ibid It is also claimed, but untrue, that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was Truganini, who died in 1876. This belief stems from a distinction between \\"full bloods\\" and \\"half castes\\" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in missions set up on the islands of Bass Strait. This portrait of a young Indigenous boy was commissioned by a member of a Christian mission station to show the achievements of the mission at \\"civilising\\" the Indigenous population. Nevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the Guugu Yimithirr people who met James Cook near Cooktown in 1770. Bennelong served as interlocutor between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as John King, who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was William Buckley, an escaped convict, who was with the Wautharong people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players. Agriculture As the European pastoral industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood. In south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the Australian goldrushes. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, rabbits and cattle, all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably pearling, also employed Aboriginal workers. In many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources. =1900–1940s= Aboriginal Bora ceremony (early 20th century) In spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century. In 1914 around 800 Aboriginal people answered the call to arms to fight in World War I, despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military. As the war continued, these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed. Many enlisted by claiming they were Māori or Indian. By the 1920s, the Indigenous population had declined to between 50,000 and 90,000, and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held, even among Australians sympathetic to their situation. But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of penicillin to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline. In the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of World War II in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the Caledon Bay crisis, and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, the father of modern social anthropology, published his Social Organization of Australian Tribes in 1931. By the end of World War II, many Indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary. However, Aboriginal workers remained unfree labourers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, Jack Patten led a strike at Cummeragunja Station in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meagre rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the Cummeragunja walk-off, and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.http://www.koorihistory.com/jack-patten/ Koori History: Remembering Jack Patten On 1 May 1946, Aboriginal peoples station workers in the beautiful region of Western Australia started the 1946 Pilbara strike and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal Pastoral Industry Award of 1968, which required the payment of a minimum wage to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became refugees or fringe dwellers, living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities. 1940s–present In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections. All Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the Menzies government in 1962.Australian Electoral Commission - Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in November 1963. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965. The 1967 referendum, passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referenda. In 1971, Yolngu people at Yirrkala sought an injunction against Nabalco to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial Gove land rights case, Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been terra nullius before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the Yolngu people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the Woodward Commission, and then to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. In 1972, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the steps of Parliament House in Canberra, in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were \\"strangers in their own country\\". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site. In 1975, the Whitlam government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976) was introduced by the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant \\"inalienable\\" freehold title to some traditional lands. In 1984, a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe in Australia.Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932–1984 A 1987 federal government report described the history of the \\"Aboriginal Homelands Movement\\" or \\"Return to Country movement\\" as \\"a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, reserves, missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country\\". In 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the Mabo Case, declaring the previous legal concept of terra nullius to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise Native Title claims over land in Australia. In 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see Stolen generation) from their families, a National Sorry Day was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, John Howard. In 1999 a referendum was held to change the Australian Constitution to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic. In 2004, the Australian Government abolished The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, Geoff Clark, as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been mainstreamed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination was established within the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and now with the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to co-ordinate a \\"whole of government\\" effort. Funding was withdrawn from remote homelands (outstations). In June 2005, Richard Frankland, founder of the Your Voice political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth- century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians \\"be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the Australian War Memorial\\". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, The Age, said that \\"Frankland has raised an important question,\\" and asked whether moving \\"work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history.\\" In 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a formal apology for the Stolen Generations.

SWOMSI's displays included train cars adjacent to the building. Those train cars are now part of the current restaurant's dining facilities.Architectural Associates: Oregon Electric Station Work began to convert the station into a restaurant in 1977.

Harold Oswin, an employee of William Neilson, developed Crispy Crunch in 1930.  History  Harold Oswin was a candy roller in Neilson's hard candy room and joined the company when he was fourteen years old. Harold was promoted to Candy maker in the late 1920s. He always had wanted to create a candy bar with peanut butter and so when a chocolate bar contest was announced, he submitted his concept. Harold won the contest and received a $5.00 prize. The original recipe called for a log-shaped bar. Williams Neilson management made the decision to flatten the bar to the shape that it is today. Oswin died in the mid-1990s. The brand was repositioned in 1988 by Norm Williams, Director of Marketing. The new brief was given to Martin Shewchuck of Leo Burnett Canada who conceived the highly successful Crispy Crunch campaigns (\\"the only thing better than your Crispy Crunch is someone else's\\"). The campaign catapulted the brand from No. 10 to No. 1, growing volume by 55%. Crispy Crunches were sold in the United States for a brief time in the 1990s by the food distribution arm of Pro Set, the collectible card company. Pro Set went bankrupt, resulting in Crispy Crunch no longer being available in the United States. A lower-calorie version of Crispy Crunch was available for a limited time in the mid-1990s. The original manufacturers, Neilson, sold its chocolate brands to Cadbury in 1996, though packaging continued to feature the Neilson logo for a few years. Since Cadbury began manufacturing of the chocolate bar, the recipe has changed in that it is less salty and more sweet as it has more of the crunchy topaz- coloured candy coating around the centre.

She subsequently accused Sherwood of abusing her during their relationship. In court documents and press interviews, Ore said she met Congressman Sherwood at a Young Republicans meeting in September 1999. Ore was 23 years old and Sherwood was 58 when they began a \\"close romantic and intimate personal relationship\\", according to a 2005 . Their five-year extramarital affair ended after Ore described several instances of physical abuse by the congressman. On the afternoon of September 15, 2004, Ore locked herself inside the bathroom of Sherwood's Washington, D.C. apartment. She used her cell phone to make an emergency call to police. When authorities arrived, Ore reported that she had been choked by Sherwood. The congressman told police he was only giving her a backrub. Initially, no charges were filed. Their relationship soon ended--though Ore has stated that Sherwood remained in contact with her. Sherwood initially denied the affair, stating that Ore was merely a \\"casual acquaintance\\". After a was leaked to the press in 2005, Sherwood publicly admitted his lengthy affair with Ore, but denied her reports of abuse. Ore filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against Sherwood in June 2005. The suit was settled out of court on November 8, 2005, but the terms of the monetary settlement have never been made public. In an interview with a Wilkes-Barre newspaper, Ore said she was born to a wealthy family and grew up in Peru. Various news stories in 2005 and 2006 gave her age as 29 and mentioned in passing that, in 2001, she had been an intern for U.S. Representative Bill Shuster, another Pennsylvania Republican, but left after two days. Newspapers also reported that she was said to be taking business classes at Johns Hopkins University and, in 2006, had changed her name. References External links *\\"Rep.

Early life Born to a Ukrainian Jewish family,\\"Whither Quo Vadis?: Sienkiewicz's Novel in Film and Television\\" By Ruth Scodel and Anja Bettenworth p. 215 he arrived to the US in August 1914. He began his career at 16 as an office boy to Richard A. Rowland who was president of Metro Studios and studied film editing. He began to do some editing in his spare time when films needed to be trimmed to meet censorship requirements. He became friendly with actress Alla Nazimova who was under contract to Metro and told her of his desire to be a full editor. She invited him out to Hollywood in 1920 to become second assistant editor on her films. In 1923 when Nazimova's contract with Metro ended, he returned with her to New York and became her assistant stage manager on Broadway. Film editor In 1924 Zimbalist returned to Los Angeles seeking film work. Metro pictures had merged with Sam Goldwyn's company to become MGM. Zimbalist went to work for them as an assistant editor and soon worked his way up to full editor. He edited the 1925 version of The Wizard of Oz. Among the films he edited at MGM were Lon Chaney's While the City Sleeps (1928), Alias Jimmy Valentine, the studio's first sound film, and The Broadway Melody (1929), the first sound musical. Film producer He was promoted to assistant producer in 1929 working for Hunt Stromberg and became a producer on his own in 1936 with Married Before Breakfast. He produced films including Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), the story of the Doolittle Raiders, King Solomon's Mines (1950) and Quo Vadis (1951). The latter two both received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture. Quo Vadis was MGM's second-highest-grossing film at the time behind Gone With the Wind and MGM's most profitable film of the era with worldwide rentals of $23 million on a cost of $7 million. Based on the success of Quo Vadis, he was made producer of MGM's most elaborate production until that time, the 1959 epic Ben-Hur. Death Zimbalist collapsed suddenly of a heart attack on set in Rome, Italy, during filming of Ben-Hur. He was taken to his villa where he died. He was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City, California. He received a posthumous Oscar for the film, and remains the only person to ever posthumously receive a Best Picture award. His Oscar was accepted by his wife Mary Zimbalist, who made a speech in honor of her late husband. Ben-Hur was even more profitable than Quo Vadis becoming MGM's second-highest-grossing film at the time (again, behind Gone With the Wind) making Zimbalist the producer of the second- and third-highest-grossing films at the studio. He left an estate of $500,000. Personal life He married Margaret C. Donovan in 1924. They divorced in 1950. Zimbalist then married Mary Taylor, a former fashion model and actress, in 1952.

Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion, multimode dispersion, modal distortion, intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion. In the ray optics analogy, modal dispersion in a step-index optical fiber may be compared to multipath propagation of a radio signal. Rays of light enter the fiber with different angles to the fiber axis, up to the fiber's acceptance angle. Rays that enter with a shallower angle travel by a more direct path, and arrive sooner than rays that enter at a steeper angle (which reflect many more times off the boundaries of the core as they travel the length of the fiber). The arrival of different components of the signal at different times distorts the shape. Modal dispersion limits the bandwidth of multimode fibers. For example, a typical step-index fiber with a 50 μm core would be limited to approximately 20 MHz for a one kilometer length, in other words, a bandwidth of 20 MHz·km. Modal dispersion may be considerably reduced, but never completely eliminated, by the use of a core having a graded refractive index profile. However, multimode graded-index fibers having bandwidths exceeding 3.5 GHz·km at 850 nm are now commonly manufactured for use in 10 Gbit/s data links. Modal dispersion should not be confused with chromatic dispersion, a distortion that results due to the differences in propagation velocity of different wavelengths of light. Modal dispersion occurs even with an ideal, monochromatic light source. A special case of modal dispersion is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), a fiber dispersion phenomenon usually associated with single-mode fibers. PMD results when two modes that normally travel at the same speed due to fiber core geometric and stress symmetry (for example, two orthogonal polarizations in a waveguide of circular or square cross-section), travel at different speeds due to random imperfections that break the symmetry. Troubleshooting In multimode optical fiber with many wavelengths propagating, it is sometimes hard to identify the dispersed wavelength out of all the wavelengths that are present, if there is not yet a service degradation issue. One can compare the present optical power of each wavelength to the designed values and look for differences. After that, the optical fiber is tested end to end. If no loss is found, then most probably there is dispersion with that particular wavelength. Normally engineers start testing the fiber section by section until they reach the affected section; all wavelengths are tested and the affected wavelength produces a loss at the far end of the fiber. One can easily calculate how much of the fiber is affected and replace that part of fiber with a new one. Replacement of optical fiber is only required when there is an intense dispersion and service is being affected; otherwise various methods can be used to compensate for the dispersion.

He was Minister of Economy and was the principal proponent of classical liberalism in Argentina. Murió Álvaro Alsogaray, principal figura del liberalismo argentino, Clarín, 2 de abril de 2005 First years Alsogaray was born in Esperanza, Santa Fe, in 1913, as the eldest of three children to Julia Elisa Bosch and Álvaro Alsogaray. Born to a prominent local military family, Alsogaray graduated from the National Military College as an infantry officer. He studied military engineering in the Army's School of Higher Technical Studies and civil and aeronautical engineer at the National University of Córdoba. He married Edith Gay in 1940, and had two sons and a daughter. Early career He retired from the army with the rank of captain and with two engineering degrees, which led to his being called el capitán ingeniero. He entered business, becoming an important contractor for State enterprises such as FAMA (a predecessor of flag carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas), and briefly served as its director during the presidency of Juan Perón, whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogaray's thinking. After the coup that removed Perón in 1955, he held the posts of Under-secretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry, and maintained numerous Peronist staffers at the Undersecretariat despite his support for the coup. He founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956; the party fared modestly in the 1958 elections. Minister of Economy with Presidents Frondizi and Guido To placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives, the otherwise progressive Arturo Frondizi named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959. Inheriting large trade deficits, Alsogaray sharply devalued the peso and imposed severe credit controls on Argentina's large public banks.Página/12 :: El país :: Alsogaray no llegó al invierno Declaring that the economy \\"must go through winter\\",Todo Argentina: 1959 the austerity measures were a boon to exporters - but caused consumer prices to double in 1959, and real wages and construction to fall by about 20%.Lewis, Paul. The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. The resulting trade surplus and pro-growth policies pursued by Frondizi's unofficial point man on the economy, Rogelio Julio Frigerio, both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961.Todo Argentina: Frondizi Cornide, Osvaldo. A 50 años de la asunción de Arturo Frondizi. Marginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 recession and deeply unpopular, Alsogaray resigned early in 1961. Frigerio had been President Frondizi's first choice for the critical Economy Ministry, an appointment thwarted by the military; Frondizi and Frigerio later founded the MID, a political party centered around the need for accelerated development. Frondizi's efforts to mediate differences between the United States and Cuba ultimately resulted in a March, 1962, coup d'état, and Álvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother, General Julio Alsogaray, to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizi's military-appointed successor, Senate President José María Guido. Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies, as well as nearly worthless \\"Ninth of July\\" bonds, which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors, the economy again slipped into severe recession; the trade balance improved, albeit the cost of depressed business investment. Later career and National Deputy Out of power after the election of Dr. Arturo Illia in 1963, Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration, even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed. Finding allies in conservative business and media interests, the powerful Roman Catholic Church, and his influential brother Julio, Alsogaray and other Illia opponents were successful.Rock, David. Authoritarian Argentina. University of California Press, 1992.Todo Argentina: Arturo Illia Following the 1966 coup against President Illia, he was designated Ambassador to the United States, a post he held until 1968. Alsogaray founded the 'New Force' in 1972, though like the Independent Civic Party, it fared poorly in the 1973 elections that returned Perón to power. He was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent March 1976 coup, but largely supported the subsequent National Reorganization Process. As the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections, he founded the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCeDé) in 1982. Running as a right-wing, economically conservative candidate on the latter ticket, he stood for the Presidency in 1983 and 1989. Alsogaray received two million votes (10%) in his 1989 presidential bid, behind only major party candidates Carlos Menem and Eduardo Angeloz. Continuing to enjoy a measure of support in Buenos Aires' affluent northside, he and his daughter María Julia Alsogaray were elected the only two national deputies for the UCeDé in 1983, and he served until 1999. A vehement anti-Peronist and anti-socialist, Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Perón's Justicialist Party in 1989, following their nomination of pro-market Governor Carlos Menem, and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightly-contested seat in the Argentine Senate representing the City of Buenos Aires. Argentine Senators were indirectly elected at the time, and Alsogaray's endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat, despite the latter's coming in second to centrist UCR candidate Fernando de la Rúa.La Nación (April 2, 2005) The Universidad Francisco Marroquín granted Alsogaray an honorary doctorate in 1985.Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín A vocal supporter of the era's privatizations, he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter, María Julia, Secretary of the Environment, in which post she served from 1991 to 1999, and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency, endorsing the populist-turned-conservative president in his 1995 re-election bid. Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 1995-96 for the replacement of Buenos Aires' two international airports for an island terminal on the Río de la Plata; opposed by de la Rúa, who had been elected Mayor (and would later be President), the project never materialized.Clarín (August 22, 1996) His UCedé party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies, as because of rivalries in the party itself - notably between his daughter and Adelina D'Alessio de Viola (whom he had Menem appoint as head of the National Mortgage Bank). Commenting on the dispute, he remarked that \\"would it that one's political party could do without affiliates...or women!\\" References External links * Category:1913 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People from Esperanza, Santa Fe Category:Argentine people of Basque descent Category:National University of Córdoba alumni Category:Colegio Militar de la Nación alumni Category:Argentine engineers Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:Argentine Ministers of Finance Category:Ambassadors of Argentina to the United States Category:Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies Category:Candidates for President of Argentina Category:Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina) politicians Category:Argentine anti-communists Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery Category:Conservatism in Argentina Category:20th-century businesspeople Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Álvaro Alsogaray"},{"id":"7705971","text":"\\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" is a 1977 slow jam recorded by The Isley Brothers as an album track featured on the group's double-platinum album Go For Your Guns. It was the B-side to \\"Groove with You\\", which reached #16 on the R&B; singles chart. The track also marked Ron Isley's growing transition into singing more ballads, compared to the band's earlier funk approach. The song is featured in the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional R&B; radio station The Vibe 98.8. Legacy While the song didn't chart on the pop singles chart, it still garnered popularity initially for its laid-back grooves and the solemn lyrics (the song discussed infidelity) and later would be the basis of a sample years later first by rap group Compton's Most Wanted on their album Straight Checkn 'Em on the track \\"Can I Kill It?\\" and rapper Ice Cube, who used the musical instrumental of the song for his breakthrough hit, \\"It Was a Good Day\\". While the song is well noted for its unique guitar timbre which can be heard on other Isley Brother tracks such as \\"Voyage to Atlantis\\"Go for Your Guns. However, the track is most commonly sampled for its unique syncopated drum riff. The song was again sampled by Black Milk on Slum Village's 2005 self-titled album on the track \\"Call Me\\" (which featured R&B; singer Dwele), and Hip-Hop producer J Dilla reworked it into \\"Won't Do\\" on his posthumous album The Shining. Singer k-os used a sped-up sample from the song for his 2002 single \\"Heaven Only Knows\\", from his album Exit. Although lesser known, the song was also sampled by Usher on his second album My Way in the song \\"One Day You'll Be Mine.\\" The song is also sampled on the Rhymefest song \\"All Girls Cheat\\" from his 2006 album Blue Collar, although the portion of the song used is sung by Mario, and not a sample of the original recording. Alicia Keys heavily sampled on her song \\"A Woman's Worth\\", recorded for her 2005 live album Unplugged. The song was also sampled by Raheem DeVaughn on \\"Until\\", a song from his debut album, The Love Experience. Thundercat's \\"Them Changes\\" from his 2015 record The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam also quotes the famous drum kit opening of the song.

A professional organizer assists individuals and businesses to improve their organizing systems and process. Basement, before tidying Basement, after tidying This industry has been popularized by a number of television programs produced on the subject, beginning with Life Laundry in 2002. This was followed by other programs, such as Clean Sweep, Neat, Mission: Organization, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo and Hot Mess House.  Professional Organizing around the world  Professional Organizing is represented globally by the International Association of Professional Organizing Associations (IFPOA). Its members are not for profit membership bodies with at least 100 members and have operated as a membership body for professional organizers for at least 3 years. As at December 2019, IFPOA comprises the following membership bodies for industry professionals: * Brazil: Associação Nacional de Profissionais de Organização e Produtividade (ANPOP) * Canada: Professional Organizers in Canada (POC) * Italy: Associazione Professional Organizers Italia (APOI) * Japan: Japanese Association of Life Organizers (JALO) * Republic of Korea: Korea Association of Professional Organizers (KAPO) * Netherlands: Nederlands Beroepsvereniging van Professional Organizers (NBPO) * United Kingdom: Association of Professional Declutterers & Organisers (APDO) * United States: Institute for Challenging Disorganization (ICD) * United States: National Association of Productivity & Organizing Professionals (NAPO)  Definitions  NAPO defines Professional Organizer and Productivity Consultant as follows: * A Professional Organizer supports evaluation, decision-making, and action around objects, space, and data; helping clients achieve desired outcomes regarding function, order, and clarity. * A Productivity Consultant supports evaluation, decision-making, and action around time, energy, and resources; helping clients achieve desired outcomes regarding goals, effectiveness, and priorities.  Certifications and Credentials  Certified Professional Organizers (CPOs) have proven industry proficiency by demonstrating they possess the body of knowledge and experience essential to professional organizing and productivity consulting. The CPO® credential identifies professional organizers who've documented a specific number of paid hours that include transferring organizing skills to the client, and passed the Board of Certification for Professional Organizers (BCPO®) examination. The credential provides the organizing and productivity industry a way to elevate its professional standards. The National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals' education arm is known as NAPO University. Currently NAPO University offers two Specialist Certificates: Residential Organizing and Workplace Productivity. A third Specialist Certificate in Life Transitions will be launched in early 2018. NAPO University also offers a Resources Track to support Professional Organizers and Productivity Consultants in developing and growing their businesses. Principles Professional Organizers achieve the goal of creating and maintaining organizational systems by teaching others the basic principals of organization. Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests communicating these principals by using the acronym \\"SPACE\\", interpreted as: S=Sort, P=Purge, A=Assign a Home, C=Containerize and E=Equalize. The last step (\\"E\\") consists in monitoring how the new system that has been created is working, adjusting it if needed, and maintaining it. This principle is applicable to every type of organization. As one of their main jobs, Professional Organizers help clients reduce excessive clutter (paper, books, clothing, shoes, office supplies, home decor items, etc.) in the home or in the office. Professional Organizers offer a wide variety of services, from designing a functional closet, to organizing a cross-country move. For homeowners, a Professional Organizer might plan and reorganize the space of a room, improve paper management, or coach in time-management, or goal-setting. In a business setting, Professional Organizers work closely with their clients to increase productivity by stream-lining paper-filing, electronic organization, and employee time-management.

It is located in the municipality of Santa María Tonameca just east of the coastal communities of Mazunte and La Ventanilla. This is where the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains meet the Pacific Ocean. San Agustinillo is connected by a road to Zipolite and Puerto Ángel to the west. All these coastal communities together are known as the \\"Riviera Oaxaqueña or \\"La Costa Chica Oaxaqueña. Transportation The local Highway 175 makes a loop south from the main coastal Highway 200. From Pochutla, Highway 175 first goes south to Puerto Ángel, then west along the coast to Zipolite, San Agustinillo, and Mazunte. After that, it continues back north again to rejoin the main Highway 200. The local 'colectivos' buses make trips from Pochutla in both directions. History The community was established about the same time as Mazunte. Fishermen in San Augustinillo made a living by hunting sea turtles until this was banned in 1990. Major economic activities here for most residents are still agriculture and small scale fishing, with some tourism, based on the beach. The beach Playa Rinconcito at San Agustinillo. The beach of San Agustinillo is about 1300 meters long, facing open ocean, and divided into three sections by rocky outcroppings that jut out from the beach into the Pacific Ocean. The sands of the beach are medium grain, of gold color, and spread as wide as fifty meters. The waters just offshore are warm with green and blue tones. The far west end is called Playa Rinconcito, which is relatively well-sheltered and considered safest for swimming. The easternmost section is called Playa Aragon and has both strong waves and strong undertow. As these beaches face open ocean caution is advised, especially when tropical waves and other weather phenomena cause abnormally high waves, which can cause beach restrictions and closures. In 2009, at least three drownings were reported off this beach, including a six-year-old girl who was caught while on the shoreline by an unusually high wave. A nineteen-year-old was dragged out to sea when he was surprised by an undercurrent, and his body was not found until five days later. The fishing village is located at the far west end at Playa Rinconcito. The fishermen offer boat tours of the area as well as rental for sportsfishing. Just immediately to the east of the village are palapas but almost nothing has been built at the far eastern end. From June to December it is possible to see olive ridley turtles laying their eggs on this beach. Local businesses The beach is encroached by hills and steep cliffs that make the building of large hotels and other resort features impossible. However, the shoreline and some of the hills surrounding it are dotted with small rustic establishments which show ecological and European influence. The European influence is because a number of establishments here are owned by Italians and some French. Restaurants include La Termita, owned by an Italian- Argentinian, and Tio Nerone, owned by an Italian-German. The Mexico Lindo hotel on the beach is owned by a Mexican from Tabasco by the name of Fausto and also serves Italian food along with Regional favorites. Another Italian- owned lodging is the Posada La Termita, also on the waterfront. Casa Pan de Miel has a French owner. It is not on the beach but on a hilltop overlooking the area. Since the area emphasizes eco tourism, many of the lodgings here were built as \\"low-impact\\" that blend in with the topography. One of this is La Posada del Arquitecto which is carved into the rocks of Playa Rinconcito. The rooms have hanging beds and a shower built into a tree trunk. Everything is constructed with wooden pegs instead of nails. Many of the lodgings here do not have websites or even phones but are popular with backpackers nonetheless. None have running hot water. Most hotels do not have televisions, phone or wireless connections, or air conditioning. The library The library of San Agustinillo is called \\"Las cuatro amigas\\" referring to the four women who opened it in the Casa Municipal (municipal office building) on Highway 175. The library is free to residents, and tourists may borrow books for a nominal fee. About half the collection is in Spanish, about half in English, and the rest in other languages such as French and German. The library also offers English classes for the children of the town. The organization that runs the library has a website at La Biblioteca de San Agustinillo.

Against the opinion of David ConforteḲore ha- Dorot, p. 26a that Ibn Ḥabib wrote commentaries only upon those tractates which R. Nissim had omitted, Azulai Shem ha-Gedolim proved that Ibn Ḥabib's Nimmuḳei Yosef covered the entire halachot of Isaac Alfasi, but a part of it had remained unpublished, and that the commentary to the halachot of Moed Katan and Makkot, attributed to R. Nissim, belongs to Ibn Ḥabib. The latter quotes Asher ben Jehiel, Ritva, his master RaM, and R. Nissim himself. Nimmuḳei Yosef on Ketubot and Nedarim was also included in the work Ishei Adonai (Leghorn, 1795), and the portion on Shebuot in the Bet ha-Beḥirah (ib. 1795).

Biography In his early years, Hines acted as a caretaker to residents in New York's Eleventh Assembly District. This helped him win support and influence over the area's residents. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hines maintained \\"absolute power\\" over his district and was arguably the most powerful political boss in Tammany Hall. Jimmy Walker's election as Mayor of New York City would also firmly establish Hines' influence over the local political scene As boss of Tammany Hall's Eleventh Assembly District in uptown Manhattan, Hines had access to various sources of wealth and developed close ties with many mobsters such as Lucky Luciano., leader of the city's dominant Luciano crime family. In 1932, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for President and wanted to weaken Tammany Hall.http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/fdr/section2.rhtml Walker, who was tainted by allegations of corruption and was a threat to Roosevelt's campaign,http://www.observer.com/2000/01/the-making-of-fdr-1932-a-rollicking- new-york-tale/ into resigning. Seeing Tammany Hall as a political liability, Roosevelt decided to appoint a new mayor, a privilege the New York Governor had after any mayor of New York City resigned, and focused on backing a candidate who would destroy Tammany Hall's power for good. Liberal Republican Fiorello LaGuardia, a former Representative and a fierce opponent of Tammany Hall whom Hines had successfully forced from power in the 1932 Congressional election,Stolberg, Mary M. Fighting Organised Crime: Politics, Justice, and the Legacy of Thomas E. Dewey (1995) pg. 229 was elected mayor in 1933, and Tammany Hall's longtime influence over local politicians faded. Hines would not fall. After becoming President, Roosevelt appointed Hines to oversee the U.S. civil service's patronage system for employees in the Manhattan District. Hines' empire grew soon afterward. In 1938, Hines was accused of being involved in the policy racket with Dutch Schultz (who was murdered in 1935) and Dixie Davis and of violating the \\"lottery laws\\". Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey would successfully get Hines convicted on 13 counts of racketeering. Hines provided protection for the policy racket in Harlem and other sections of New York. Hines was charged with influencing Magistrates Capshaw and Erwin to throw out policy cases in which the other conspirators had an interest and to influence former District Attorney William C. Dodge to 'go easy' on policy prosecutions. Hines was alleged to have received a cut in the proceeds of the policy racket. After the first trial ended in a mistrial, he was charged again and Charles Cooper Nott, Jr. presided over the second trial. He died on March 26, 1957 at the Long Beach Memorial Hospital.

Description L. scutata has an olive-brown to brown carapace with some dark spotting (in juveniles) or reticulations (in adults), and the first peripheral is smaller than the second. The head is olive to brown with an indistinct dark stripe extending backward from each orbit and another passing backward between the orbits. Distribution and habitat L. scutata lives in the Irrawaddy and Salween rivers of Myanmar, the vicinities of Bhamo, Pathein, Chauk, Yangon, Bago, and Mawlamyine in Myanmar, northeastern Thailand, and possibly in Yunnan Province, China (Kuchling, 1995).  Ecology and behavior  = Diet = The Burmese flapshell turtle is a piscivore. = Life cycle = L. scutata reproduces sexually. It is oviparous.  Conservation  Although the Burmese flapshell turtle is listed as Data Deficient, some speculate it may be Vulnerable as it is traded in large numbers in East Asian food markets. However, not enough research has been done to come to a conclusion on this species' conservation status.

A force of 17,000–20,000 Russian soldiers backed by 90 artillery pieces under Prince Pyotr Bagration and General Lieutenant Nikolay Raevsky attacked 21,500–28,000 French troops and 55 guns of Marshal Louis- Nicolas Davout at and near the village of Saltanovka south of Mogilev on 23 July. All Russian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses through superior French infantry and artillery firepower. French casualties amounted to 1,200 men, while the Russians lost 2,548. Davout's victory prevented the Russian Second Western Army under Bagration from joining the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk but could not stop Bagration from effecting the link-up later at Smolensk. Prelude Avoiding French envelopment attempts at the beginning of the invasion, the Russian Second Western Army under Prince Pyotr Bagration was ordered on 7 July to join, via Mogilev, the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly. Bagration was threatened with encirclement by French emperor Napoleon's forces under King Jerome to the west and Marshal Louis- Nicolas Davout's I Corps to the north. The Russian Prince moved rapidly to cross the Dnieper river at Mogilev to link up with Barclay. Davout was faster, however, and 28,000 of his troops took Mogilev on 20 July. The Russians arrived before Mogilev on 21 July and their vanguard under Colonel Vasily Sysoev drove out Davout's forward detachments near the village of Dashkovka to the south of Mogilev. Opposing forces =Russian= Bagration had 45,000 men available but assigned only General Nikolay Raevsky's 17,000–20,000-strong VII Corps to attack Davout.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_mogilev.html Bagration's order was essentially for an aggressive reconnaissance in force. Depending on the strength of the French, Raevsky would either drive the French out and capture Orsha, thereby covering the First Western Army's crossing of the Dnieper or delay them long enough for Bagration to cross south of Mogilev. =French= Weakened by the transferral of his troops elsewhere and fatigue, Davout had 21,500–28,000 effectives on hand at Mogilev, including 22,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, in three infantry division under generals Jean Dominique Compans, Joseph Marie Dessaix and Michel Marie Claparède and cavalry under generals Étienne de Bordesoule and Valence. Davout deployed his forces at Saltanovka, a naturally strong position. The left flank was covered by the bogs of the Dnieper. A stream ran through a ravine across his front, with a bridge inside Saltanovka. The village itself was surrounded by forests. Davout constructed earthworks to strengthen his line, fortified the buildings on the main road and set up artillery batteries. The bridge at Fatova was destroyed. Battle =Initial stages= At 07:00 on 23 July, VII Corps' advance guard of two Jäger battalions under Colonel Andre Glebov drove out Davout's outposts on the French left flank. By 08:00, the bridge on the left was in Russian hands and the Jäger continued their advance. Davout deployed the 85th Line Regiment for a counterattack, backed by artillery. The Russian attack failed as crushing French artillery and infantry firepower mowed down the unprotected Russian infantry, who died where they stood rather than break for cover. While the Russian attack was faltering, Bagration sent Raevsky a new order to storm Mogilev. =Fatova= The 26th Infantry Division under Ivan Paskevich assaulted Fatova in extended column formation, forcing I/85 to retreat. Davout sent a battalion of the 108th Line Regiment and some artillery to help out. The two French battalions redeployed on the heights south of Fatova and defeated the Russian attacks. Backed by 12 guns, Paskevich opened another assault that bashed through the French defenders to take the village. Past Fatova, Davout had prepared an ambush with four battalions from the 108th Line, lying low amidst the wheat fields behind the village. The concealed French troops launched a devastating counterattack that caused heavy losses on the Russians and threw them back in disarray. Fatova was recaptured by the French. Paskevich attacked and captured the village again. Davout now moved forward the 61st Line from his reserve. All Russian attacks were repulsed and on the right, two French battalions overran the Nizhniy-Novgorod and Orlov regiments, crossing the stream. Paskevich deployed the Poltava regiment to prevent his right flank from being enveloped. =Saltanovka= The Russian attack's main point of effort was Saltanovka. Raevsky personally led the Smolensk Infantry Regiment to capture a dam and shield the attack of his main force. The 6th and 42nd Jäger Regiments would act as support, along with artillery on both sides of the main road. Paskevich's assault on Fatova would take place at the same time. Raevsky blundered, however, not hearing the agreed-upon artillery fire that would signal the advance. His own attack started too late. French artillery inflicted huge losses on Raevsky's men. Raevsky personally led a charge, allegedly with his 11 and 16-year old sons Nikolai and Aleksandr (although Raevsky denied it), but the attempt failed regardless. French prisoners informed Raevsky that French reinforcements were on the way. Bagration ordered a full retreat to Dashkovka.Mikaberidze A. Russian Officer Corps of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Casemate Publishers, 2005. P. 320 Davout attacked the Russian rearguard later that day but did not achieve a result. Tolstoy gives an account of the storming of the dam in War And Peace, Book III, Chapter 12 when an officer describes the event to a sceptical Count Nikolai. Aftermath The Second Western Army constructed a bridge south of Mogilev at Novy Bikhov and crossed the Dnieper toward Smolensk. The battle prevented Bagration from joining the First Western Army under Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk, forcing Bagration to retreat to Smolensk. Saltanovka is generally seen as a French victory but despite failing to link up with Barclay at Vitebsk, Bagration accomplished his objective of joining the main Russian force later at Smolensk, and avoided Napoleon's encirclement. =Casualties= The Russian losses were 2,548 men killed and wounded, although Marshal Davout officially declared that they lost 1,200 dead and 4,000 wounded. Davout admitted to only 900 casualties, which include 100 prisoners from the 108th line regiment and were officially reported by him. The Russians claimed French casualties of 4,134 killed, wounded and missing. Actual French losses were about 1,200. Footnotes References Pigeard, Alain. Dictionnaire des batailles de Napoléon.

The game was produced in MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amiga versions, and was originally released in March 1992. The current copyright holder was Strategic Simulations, Inc., which later became part of Ubisoft. Gameplay The game has two basic components. The first requires the player to engage in Risk-like strategic decision-making with the goal of conquering the given land mass. The player raises cyborg armies to accomplish this goal. During the second basic component of the game, the top- down battle mode, players can choose to assume manual control of one cyborg in their army during offensive or defensive battle sessions, or let the computer simulate the battle behind the scenes to much more predictable outcomes. This allows players to play only the Risk-style board game component of the game. The opposite, battles only, is also possible. Cyber Empires innovated by mixing strategy with arcade action on a global scale. The game offers a total of nine different cyborgs from which the user can create an army of up to 10 units, that is no more 10 units may occupy one country. The units range from the small fast mercury capable of little damage but a high speed, to the Titan which is the ultimate cyborg capable of long-range missile attacks and short- range auto-cannon attacks. The strategy part of the game allows the user to place capitols in any countries occupied by their troops. Countries with capitols in them create extra revenue every turn and can be built upon. The buildings includes fortifications, factories and factory upgrades. Fortifications comes in 3 varieties: light, medium and heavy, but can only protect a country if at least one cyborg is present. Factories come in 3 varieties also, they can have 1, 2 or 4 bays. The number of bays a factory has determined the number of cyborgs it can build at once. The upgrade level of a factory, on the other hand, determines how fast an individual cyborg can be built. Reception Computer Gaming World warned that Cyber Empires was an action game with strategic elements and that it was not well suited for strategy-only players. The magazine called it \\"a solid game. It has nothing to rave about and nothing that hobbles it\\", with \\"adequate\\" graphics and sound, and recommended the game to action gamers who were \\"fans of BattleTech, RoboTech and Giant Robot universes\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game two-plus stars out of five.

It is the largest synagogue in Europe, seating 3,000 people and is a centre of Neolog Judaism. The synagogue was built between 1854 and 1859 in the Moorish Revival style, with the decoration based chiefly on Islamic models from North Africa and medieval Spain (the Alhambra). The synagogue's Viennese architect, Ludwig Förster, believed that no distinctively Jewish architecture could be identified, and thus chose \\"architectural forms that have been used by oriental ethnic groups that are related to the Israelite people, and in particular the Arabs\\". The interior design is partly by Frigyes Feszl. The Dohány Street Synagogue complex consists of the Great Synagogue, the Heroes' Temple, the graveyard, the Memorial and the Jewish Museum, which was built on the site on which Theodor Herzl's house of birth stood. Dohány Street itself, a leafy street in the city center, carries strong Holocaust connotations as it constituted the border of the Budapest Ghetto. History Built in a residential area between 1854-1859 by the Jewish community of Pest according to the plans of Ludwig Förster, the monumental synagogue has a capacity of 2,964 seats (1,492 for men and 1,472 in the women's galleries), making it the largest in Europe and one of the largest working synagogues in the world (after the Beit Midrash of Ger in Jerusalem, the Belz Great Synagogue and Temple Emanu-el in New York City). The consecration of the synagogue took place on 6 September 1859. The synagogue was bombed by the Hungarian pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party on 3 February 1939. Used as a base for German Radio and also as a stable during World War II, the building suffered some severe damage from aerial raids during the Nazi Occupation but especially during the Siege of Budapest. During the Communist era, the damaged structure became again a prayer house for the much-diminished Jewish community. Its restoration and renovation started in 1991, financed by the state and by private donations, and was completed in 1998 (see below). Architecture =Exterior= The building is long and wide. The style of the Dohány Street Synagogue is Moorish but its design also features a mixture of Byzantine, Romantic and Gothic elements. Two onion domes sit on the twin octagonal towers at height. A rose stained-glass window sits over the main entrance. Similarly to basilicas, the building consists of three spacious richly decorated aisles, two balconies and, unusually, an organ. Its ark contains various torah scrolls taken from other synagogues destroyed during the Holocaust. The Central Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City is a near- exact copy of the Dohány Street Synagogue. =Interior= The torah-ark and the internal frescoes made of colored and golden geometric shapes are the works of the famous Hungarian romantic architect Frigyes Feszl. A single-span cast iron supports the nave. The seats on the ground-floor are for men, while the upper gallery, supported by steel ornamented poles, has seats for women. This synagogue is very different from other synagogues as it is the only one to have pipe organs and a cemetery. Franz Liszt and Camille Saint-Saëns played the original 5,000-pipe organ built in 1859. A new mechanical organ with 63 voices and four manuals was built in 1996 by the German firm Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden GmbH. One of the most important concerts in the Synagogue's history was in 2002, by the organ virtuoso Xaver Varnus. A crowd of 7,200 filled sanctuary seats and standing space some four hours before the concert to hear the artist’s virtuosity. =Renovation= It was only in the 1990s, following the return to democracy in Hungary, that renovations could begin. The three- year program of reconstruction was initially funded by a US$5 million donation from Hungarian government. Jewish Americans Estée Lauder and Tony Curtis contributed to the additional $20 million needed to complete the restoration in 1996. Synagogue complex =Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives= Aerial view of the Dohány Street Synagogue complex The Hungarian Jewish Museum was constructed on the plot where Theodor Herzl's two-story Classicist style house stood, adjoining the Dohány synagogue. The Jewish Museum was built in 1930 in accordance with the synagogue's architectural style and attached in 1931 to the main building. It holds the Jewish Religious and Historical Collection, a collection of religious relics of the Pest Hevrah Kaddishah (Jewish Burial Society), ritual objects of Shabbat and the High Holidays and a Holocaust room. =Heroes' Temple= The arcade and the Heroes' Temple, which seats 250 people and is used for religious services on weekdays and during the winter time, was added to the Dohány Street Synagogue complex in 1931. The Heroes' Temple was designed by Lázlo Vágó and Ferenc Faragó and serves as a memorial to Hungarian Jews who gave their lives during World War I. Jewish Cemetery =Jewish Cemetery= Synagogue Budapest 2013 Dohány Street Synagogue, Budapest, Hungary In 1944, the Dohány Street Synagogue was part of the Jewish Ghetto for the city Jews and served as shelter for many hundreds. Over two thousand of those who died in the ghetto from hunger and cold during the winter 1944-1945 are buried in the courtyard of the synagogue. It is not customary to have a cemetery next to a synagogue, and the establishment of the 3,000 m2 cemetery was only the result of historical circumstances. In 1944, as a part of the Eichmann-plan, 70,000 Jews were relocated to the Ghetto of Pest. Until 18 January 1945, when the Russians liberated the ghetto, around 8,000 to 10,000 people had died, although, one part of the deceased were transferred to the Kozma Street Cemetery, but 2,000 people were buried in the makeshift cemetery. In memory of those who had died, there is a memorial by the sculptor, Imre Varga, depicting a weeping willow with the names and tattoo numbers of the dead and disappeared just behind the Synagogue, in the Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park.Address: Budapest, VII. Dohány u. 2. =Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park= The Raoul Wallenberg Emlékpark (memory park) in the rear courtyard holds the Memorial of the Hungarian Jewish Martyrs — at least 400,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Made by Imre Varga, it resembles a weeping willow whose leaves bear inscriptions with the names of victims. There is also a memorial to Wallenberg and other Righteous Among the Nations, among them: Swiss Vice-consul Carl Lutz; Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian man who, with a strategic escamotage, declared himself the Spanish consul, releasing documents of protection and current passports to Jews in Budapest without distinction (he saved five thousand); Mons. Angelo Rotta, an Italian Prelate Bishop and Apostolic Nuncio of the State of Vatican City in Budapest, which issued protective sheets, misrepresentations of baptism (to save them from forced labor) and Vatican passports to Jews, without distinction of any kind present in Budapest (saving fifteen thousand), who saved, with his secretary Mons. Gennaro Verolino tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho a Portuguese diplomat, serving as Portugal’s Chargé d'Affaires in Budapest in 1944, issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families, altogether about 1,000 lives were saved due to his actions. Carlos Sampaio Garrido the Portuguese Ambassador who resisted the Hungarian political police when the police raided his home arresting his guests. The Ambassador physically resisted the police and was also arrested but managed to have his guests released by invoking the extraterritorial legal rights of diplomatic legations; five of the guests were members of the famous Gabor family. Stones placed in a memorial behind the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest, Hungary. Trivia Dohány means tobacco in Hungarian, a loan word from Ottoman Turkish دخان (duhân), itself borrowed from Arabic (duḫḫān).

However, \\"king\\" will be used for the posthumous honors that Yang Longyan bestowed on him as Yang Longyan was then claiming the Guowang title. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. later posthumously honored King Xiaowu of Wu (吳孝武王, \\"filial and martial\\") then Emperor Wu of Wu () with the temple name of Taizu (), was a military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) late in the Chinese Tang Dynasty, whose takeover of Huainan and several nearby circuits allowed him and his family to rule over territory that would eventually become the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms state Wu (although Yang Xingmi would be the first ruler in his line to receive the title of Prince of Wu, it was a Tang-bestowed title and did not denote independence of the state), including most of modern Jiangsu and Anhui and parts of modern Jiangxi and Hubei.  Background  Yang Xingmin was born in 852, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong of Tang. He was from Lu Prefecture (廬州, in modern Hefei, Anhui). His ancestors, including his father Yang Fu (), were farmers for generations. In youth, Tian Jun and he became close friends, and they came to refer to each other as brother.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. It was said that he was physically strong in his youth, and during the Qianfu era (874-879) of Emperor Xuānzong's grandson Emperor Xizong, Yang Xingmin became a bandit. He was captured, but the prefect of Lu Prefecture, Zheng Qi, was impressed by his appearance, and stated to him, \\"You will be rich and honored one day. Why be a bandit?\\" Zheng then released him. Yang later became a soldier of the Lu Prefecture militia, and he distinguished himself in battles. However, as a result, his commander was apprehensive of him, and persuaded then-prefect Lang Youfu () to send Yang on an away mission. When Yang subsequently met his commander to bid farewell, and the commander, wanting to pretend to favor Yang, asked Yang what favors Yang would want him to do, if any; Yang responded, \\"I need your head!\\" and then killed him. Yang then took control of the militia and declared himself the commander. Lang was unable to control him, and so submitted a report to Gao Pian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit, which Lu Prefecture belonged to, recommending that Gao commission Yang the new prefect to replace Lang himself. Gao agreed, and Emperor Xizong subsequently, at Gao's recommendation, issued such a commission.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.  As prefect of Lu Prefecture  Also in 883, two of Gao Pian's officers, Yu Gongchu () and Yao Guiili (), failed in an assassination attempt against Gao's favored sorcerer Lü Yongzhi, who had in effect taken over Huainan's governance due to Gao's trust in him. Lü thus made accusations against them, and Gao sent them out to combat agrarian rebels. Lü then secretly informed Yang (falsely) that Yu and Yao's intent was to attack Lu Prefecture. Yang responded by laying an ambush for Yu and Yao, killing them, and then informing Gao that they had planned a mutiny. Gao, not knowing that Lü put this incident into motion, rewarded Yang for putting down the \\"mutiny.\\" In 884, when Gao's nephew Gao Yu (), then the prefect of nearby Shu Prefecture (舒州, in modern Anqing, Anhui), came under the attack of the local agrarian rebel Chen Ru (), Gao Yu sought aid from Yang. Yang did not have enough soldiers to respond, but sent his officer Li Shenfu, who tricked Chen into believing that a large army was arriving from Lu. As a result, Chen fled. Subsequently, when Qin Zongquan, who was previously the Tang military governor of Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) but who had rebelled against Tang by this point, sent a brother to attack Lu, Yang sent Tian Jun to repel Qin's attack. Meanwhile, when other agrarian rebels Wu Jiong () and Li Ben () attacked Shu, Gao Yu abandoned it (and was subsequently executed by Gao Pian). Yang then sent his officers Tao Ya () and Zhang Xun () to attack Wu and Li; after Tao and Zhang subsequently captured and executed Wu and Li, Yang commissioned Tao as the prefect of Shu. In 886 — by which point the prefects of Huainan appeared to be attacking each other at will to enlarge their spheres of influence — Zhang Ao () the prefect of Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) sent his officer Wei Qian () to attack Lu. Yang sent Tian, Li Shenfu, and Zhang Xun to resist, and they repelled Wei's attack. Meanwhile, though, Xu Qing () the prefect of Chú Prefecture (滁洲, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) attacked Shu; Tao was unable to resist, and fled back to Lu, allowing Xu to take Shu. Also in 886, under Gao's order, for reasons unclear, Yang changed his name from Xingmin to Xingmi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  War for control of Huainan Circuit  = War against Qin Yan and Bi Shiduo = In 887, Gao Pian's officer Bi Shiduo, fearing that Lü Yongzhi would have him killed, rebelled and put Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture () under siege. Lü, who then had a fallout with Gao himself (as Gao wanted to compromise with Bi while Lü opposed), sent Yang Xingmi an order in Gao's name requesting that he come to Yang Prefecture's aid. Yang, under the advice of his strategist Yuan Xi (), decided to act. He gathered his own forces and requested additional forces from Sun Duan () the prefect of neighboring He Prefecture (和州, in modern Chaohu, Anhui), and headed for Yang Prefecture. Before he got there, Lü, with Gao and Gao's nephew Gao Jie () turning against him, already fled Yang Prefecture, and they rendezvoused at Tianchang (天長, in modern Chuzhou), along with Bi's one-time ally Zhang Shenjian (), who had turned against Bi due to Bi's refusal to give him the spoils he wanted. (By this point, Bi, who had received aid from Qin Yan the governor of Xuanshe Circuit (宣歙, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), had offered the military governorship to Qin, so he informed Zhang that any division of spoils had to await Qin's decision, drawing Zhang's anger.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Yang Xingmi then took these joint forces and put Yang Prefecture under siege. Qin and Bi initially defended the city against the siege, but their attempts to counterattack were repelled by Yang Xingmi, who inflicted heavy losses on their troops. Meanwhile, under siege, Yang Prefecture was running out of food supplies, leaving to severe famine and cannibalism. (During the siege, Qin put Gao to death, and Yang Xingmi responded by a great display of mourning.) After several months, Yang Xingmi, unable to capture the city, considered withdrawing, but one night, Lü's former subordinate Zhang Shenwei () opened the city gates and allowed Yang Xingmi's forces in. Qin and Bi fled, allowing Yang Xingmi to capture the city. He claimed the title of acting military governor, while putting Lü and several other officers whose loyalty he considered suspect to death, including Zhang Shenjian. However, by this point, Qin Zongquan's general Sun Ru had arrived in the vicinity, having been sent earlier in the year by Qin Zongquan to vie for control of Huainan Circuit. (When Qin Zongquan subsequently tried to recall Sun, Sun killed Qin Zongquan's brother Qin Zongheng (), who was theoretically the commander of the army, and refused the recall, effectively acting independently from this point on.) Qin Yan and Bi joined forces with Sun, who immediately put up a threatening posture against Yang Xingmi. Yuan believed that with Yang Xingmi's forces worn out by the lengthy siege and the people of Yang Prefecture facing starvation, Yang Xingmi was in no shape to confront Sun. He suggested that Yang Xingmi abandon the city. Yang Xingmi agreed, and he prepared for an evacuation and return to Lu Prefecture, but did not carry it out immediately. Meanwhile, the Tang imperial government, which was also weary of the developments at Huainan Circuit, had commissioned Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) the military governor of Huainan as well. Zhu announced that he was making Yang Xingmi deputy military governor, while announcing his own officer Li Fan () as acting military governor. He sent his advisor Zhang Yanfan () to Yang Prefecture to convey his good will and decisions to Yang Xingmi. Yang Xingmi initially welcomed Zhang, but upon hearing that Zhu was sending Li Fan as acting military governor, turned angry. Zhang, in fear, fled back to Xuanwu. Meanwhile, Li Fan, on his way south, was ambushed by Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), who was angry that Zhu, not he, was given Huainan. With both Yang Xingmi and Shi turning against him, Zhu abandoned his plans of taking control of Huainan. He subsequently recommended to the imperial government that Yang be made acting military governor. In spring 888, Sun (who by this point had put Qin Yan and Bi to death and taken over their forces) finally attacked Yang Prefecture, capturing it easily. Sun claimed the title of military governor. Yang Xingmi fled, and per Yuan's suggestion, returned to Lu Prefecture to prepare his next step. = War against Sun Ru = Yang Xingmi, however, believed that Sun Ru would eventually attack him, and in fall 888, he considered heading south to attack Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) to try to take over Zhong's territory. Yuan Xi, however, pointed out that Zhong had possessed Zhennan for years and was well-prepared for an attack; instead, he suggested that Yang attack Zhao Huang the governor of Xuanshe (who had been commissioned by Qin Yan when Qin left Xuanshe to head for Huainan). Yang agreed, and also persuaded Sun Duan and Zhang Xiong, an independent general who was then at Shangyuan (上元, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), to attack Zhao as well. With Zhao's main forces distracted by Sun's and Zhang's attacks, Yang was able to cross the Yangtze River easily and put Xuanshe's capital Xuan Prefecture () under siege. When Zhao's brother Zhao Qianzhi () the prefect of Chi Prefecture (池州, in modern Chizhou, Anhui) tried to come to aid Zhao Huang, Yang sent Tao Ya to face him, and Tao defeated him, forcing him to flee to Zhennan. By 889, With Xuan Prefecture running out of food, Zhao Huang's officer Zhou Jinsi () expelled him; he tried to flee to Yang Prefecture, but Tian Jun captured him. After Yang reported what occurred to Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Yang as the governor of Xuanshe. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong, who was an old friend of Zhao Huang's, sent emissaries to request that Yang release Zhao to him. However, Yang, accepting Yuan's suggestion that doing so might leave Zhao as a threat, instead executed Zhao and gave Zhao's head to Zhu's emissaries. Meanwhile, he sent Tian to attack Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), then held by Du Leng (), a subordinate of Qian Liu; Tian surprised Du and captured him, taking Chang Prefecture. Yang also sent Ma Jingyan () to capture Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), and Ma did so. Subsequently, Emperor Zhaozong upgraded Xuanshe to a circuit with a military governor, renamed it Ningguo, and made Yang its military governor. Yang then also sent Li You () to capture Sū Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), but subsequently, Sun Ru attacked and took Su, killing Li You; Yang's officer An Renyi (), who was then at Run, then abandoned Run as well, allowing Sun to take Run. When Sun attacked Lu, Cai Chou (), whom Yang had left in defense of Lu, also surrendered it to Sun.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In spring 891, Sun pressed his attack, repeatedly defeating An and Tian, pushing toward Xuan Prefecture. It was said that the morale of Yang's army fell low in light of the defeats, rebounding only somewhat after some successes by Li Shenfu and Tai Meng (). Sun pushed forward to Huangchi (黃池, in modern Wuhu, Anhui) and defeated Yang's officers Liu Wei () and Zhu Yanshou (a younger brother of Yang's wife Lady Zhu). However, Sun's army was thereafter stricken by a flood, forcing him to withdraw and return to Yang Prefecture. He nevertheless was able to send his officers Kang Wang () and An Jingsi () to capture He and Chú Prefectures, respectively, although Li Shenfu soon recaptured them. Subsequently, Yang and Zhu Quanzhong entered into an alliance against Sun. When Sun heard this, he decided that he would destroy Yang first and then attack Zhu. He thus forced the mature men and women of Yang Prefecture across the Yangtze to accompany his army, while killing the old and the weak. (As Sun left Yang Prefecture, Yang sent Zhang Xun and Li Decheng into Yang Prefecture to take control of the remaining food supplies in the city and to comfort those who escaped Sun's massacre, effectively allowing him to take the city without a fight.) Sun subsequently surrounded Yang Xingmi at Guangde (廣德, in modern Xuancheng), and Yang Xingmi only escaped through the efforts of his officer Li Jian (). Sun then advanced toward Xuan Prefecture. Yang Xingmi sought aid from Qian, who then possessed the Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) region; Qian did not launch troops, but did aid Yang's army with food. In spring 892, With Sun's numerically superior army pressuring him, Yang considered abandoning Xuan Prefecture and withdrawing to Tongguan (銅官, in modern Tongling, Anhui). Liu, Li Shenfu, and Dai Yougui () dissuaded him, pointing out that Sun believed that he could destroy Yang quickly and therefore carried a minimal amount of food, and if Yang could simply refuse to engage Sun and wear Sun's army down, he could be destroyed. Dai further persuaded Yang to send the Yang Prefecture refugees who had fled to Ningguo back to Yang Prefecture to settle down, to try to see if that would cause Sun's army to miss Yang Prefecture. Meanwhile, Zhang and Yang's other officers also retook Chang and Run Prefectures. When Shi Pu also wanted to use this opportunity to advance south, Zhang and Li Decheng repelled his forces and further took Chǔ Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu, note different tone from the prefecture in modern Chuzhou).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. By summer 892, Sun's army had been worn down sufficiently that Yang's army was beginning to have successes, and Zhang cut off Sun's army's food supply routes. Further, Sun's army was suffering from diseases, and Sun himself was stricken with malaria. With food supplies running low, he sent his officers Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin to the nearby countryside to pillage for food. Yang, after hearing that Sun had fallen ill, made a final attack against Sun, defeating him. Tian captured Sun on the battlefield, and Yang executed Sun, sending his head to Emperor Zhaozong. Most of Sun's army surrendered to Yang, although Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin took some of the remnants and advanced south. (They eventually reached the Hunan region and took it over.) Yang then marched victoriously to Yang Prefecture and made it his headquarters again, while stationing Tian at Xuan Prefecture and An Renyi at Run Prefecture. Emperor Zhaozong, receiving Yang's report, made him the military governor of Huainan, while making Tian the acting military governor of Ningguo and An the prefect of Run.  Rule over Huainan and nearby territory  = Early rule = It was said that due to years of warfare, Huainan Circuit was stripped of its population and wealth. Yang Xingmi was frugal, promoted farming, decreased the tax burden, and encouraged commerce with nearby circuits. It was said that within several years, Huainan was restored to what it was before the war began. He organized 5,000 of Sun Ru's soldiers who submitted to him into an elite corp known as the Heiyun Corps (), and had them serve as his advance corps in battles against other circuits. Meanwhile, although Sun's subordinates largely submitted to Yang (other than the escaped Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin), Cai Chou the prefect of Lu Prefecture, who had previously been Yang's subordinate but had surrendered to Sun, started a campaign to resist Yang at Lu Prefecture, along with Ni Zhang () the prefect of Shu Prefecture. Cai, in order to show resolve, dug open the graves of Yang's ancestors, and further had an emissary offer his prefect seal to Zhu Quanzhong, seeking aid from Zhu. Zhu, however, despised Cai for his treachery, and refused to aid Cai; instead, he informed Yang of what Cai had done. Yang thanked Zhu and sent Li Shenfu to attack Cai, and commanded a follow-up army himself. Cai's subordinate Zhang Hao surrendered to Yang. Lu Prefecture fell in fall 893, and Yang executed Cai — but refused to accept the suggestion that Cai's ancestral tombs be dug up, stating: \\"Because of what Cai Chou did, the people under heaven despised him. Why should I follow his example?\\" Thereafter, he also sent Tian Jun to attack She Prefecture (歙州, in modern Huangshan, Anhui); when the people of She offered to surrender if Yang would make Tao Ya, who was known for kindness to the people, prefect, Yang did so, and She surrendered. Yang treated the imperially-commissioned prefect Pei Shu with respect, and sent him back to the imperial government. Meanwhile, Ni abandoned Shu and fled, and Yang sent Li Shenfu to be its prefect. In spring 894, Wu Tao () the prefect of Huang Prefecture (黃州, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) — which belonged to neighboring Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Wuhan) — submitted to Yang. When Wuchang's military governor Du Hong subsequently attacked Huang, Yang sent Zhu Yanshou to aid Wu Tao, starting years of warfare with Wuchang. (Wu subsequently offered to resign since he feared further attack from Du; Yang then had Ju Zhang () take over as prefect.) Meanwhile, the relationship between Yang and Zhu Quanzhong also broke down over two disputes — when an emissary of Zhu's insulted Zhang Jian () the prefect of Si Prefecture (泗州, in modern Huai'an), Zhang responded by submitting to Yang, and when Yang sent his officer Tang Linghui () to Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture () with a large supply of tea to try to sell it for profit, Zhu had Tang detained and seized all of the tea. In spring 895, Yang submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong accusing Zhu of crimes, requesting that Emperor Zhaozong order the military governors to the north to attack Zhu with him; Emperor Zhaozong's court, which was extremely weak by that point, was not recorded as having taken any actions on Yang's petition. Yang subsequently attacked Shou Prefecture and captured it; he made Zhu Yanshou its military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi), and Zhu Yanshou was subsequently able to beat back a Xuanwu counterattack and able to hold Shou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Meanwhile, Dong Chang the military governor of Yisheng Circuit (義勝, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) had misjudged his strength and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Luoping (). Qian Liu (who carried the title of military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, previously headquartered at Run Prefecture but now was headquartered at Qian's base Hang Prefecture)), who had previously been Dong's subordinate, used this as the excuse to attack Dong, seeking to conquer Dong's Yisheng Circuit. Yang, not wanting to see Qian conquer Dong, tried to dissuade Qian, and also sent emissaries to Dong urging him to immediately cancel any use of imperial title and resume offering tributes to Emperor Zhaozong. Qian would not relent in his attack, however, so Yang sent Tai Meng to attack Sū Prefecture to divert Qian's attention, while submitting petitions in Dong's defense. However, while Yang, who later went to Su himself to command the siege, was able to capture Su, additional attacks by Tian and An Renyi against other officers of Qian's were repelled, and Qian's attacks against Dong did not abate. By summer 896, Dong was forced to surrender to Qian, who executed him and took over Yisheng (which was subsequently renamed Zhendong). Meanwhile, Qian, Du Hong, and Zhong Chuan, all fearing that they would be the next target of Yang's expansion, entered into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong. Around this time, Emperor Zhaozong also gave Yang the honorary titles of acting Taifu () and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () and created him the Prince of Hongnong. By spring 897, Zhu Quanzhong had achieved final victory against two military governors that he had waged war for years — Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Zhu Xuan's cousin Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) — capturing and executing Zhu Xuan, forcing Zhu Jin to flee, and taking control of both circuits, allowing him full control of the region between the Yellow River and the Huai River. (Shi Pu's Ganhua Circuit had fallen to him in 893.) Zhu Jin fled to Huainan, along with the Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) officers Shi Yan () and Li Chengsi (), whom Hedong's military governor Li Keyong had previously sent to aid Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin. Yang personally went to Gaoyou (高郵, in modern Yangzhou) to welcome them. It was said that previously, the Huainan forces were only capable at water welfare, and now with the injection of the field soldiers from Tianping, Taining, and Hedong, their field fighting capabilities were greatly improved. Li Keyong subsequently sent emissaries to Yang, requesting that Shi and Li Chengsi be returned to him; Yang agreed, but as Yang treated Shi and Li Chengsi well and awarded them with much treasure, neither Shi nor Li Chengsi actually ever returned to Hedong, and they served Huainan thereafter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Later in spring 897, Yang resumed his attacks against Wuchang. At Du's request for assistance, Zhu Quanzhong sent his adoptive son Zhu Yougong () to attack Huang Prefecture. Ju Zhang abandoned Huang in response to Zhu Yougong's attack, but was subsequently captured by Zhu Yougong. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong, having conquered Tianping and Taining, decided to make Huainan his next target, so he gathered his available forces and sent his major general Pang Shigu () with 70,000 soldiers from Xuanwu and Ganhua Circuits to Qingkou (清口, in modern Huai'an), posturing to head to Yang Prefecture; another major general Ge Congzhou with the forces from Tianping and Taining Circuits to Anfeng (安豐, in modern Lu'an), posturing to head to Shou Prefecture; and Zhu Quanzhong himself with his main forces to Sù Prefecture (宿州, in modern Suzhou, Anhui, note different tone from the prefecture in modern Jiangsu). The people of Huainan Circuit was greatly shocked and dismayed by Zhu's forces. However, Pang, because he had such an impressive force, underestimated Yang Xingmi's army. Yang Xingmi had Zhu Jin serve as his advance commander, and Zhu constructed a dam on the Huai River. When Yang Xingmi attacked Pang, Zhu released the waters to flood Pang's army, and then attacked Pang with Yang. Pang's army was crushed by the waters and the Huainan forces, and Pang was killed. Zhu Yanshou also defeated Ge's army. Hearing that both of his generals had been defeated, Zhu Quanzhong also retreated. This battle thus affirmed Yang's control of the territory between the Huai and the Yangtze Rivers. In spring 898, Qian Liu, Zhong Chuan, Du Hong, and Wang Shifan, the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), all submitted petitions to Emperor Zhaozong, requesting that the imperial government declare a general campaign against Yang, with Zhu Quanzhong as the campaign commander; Emperor Zhaozong refused. Meanwhile, hearing of Zhu Quanzhong's defeat, Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (忠義, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) secretly entered into an alliance with Yang, but after Zhu Quanzhong found out and attacked Zhongyi, capturing Zhao's brother Zhao Kuanglin (), Zhao Kuangning agreed to abandon his alliance with Yang. Similarly, Cui Hong () the military governor of Fengguo Circuit, a vassal of Zhu's, also had secret communications with Yang, and when Zhu discovered this, Zhu sent Zhang Cunjing () to attack Cui. Cui warded off the attack by sending his brother Cui Xian () to Zhu as a hostage and promised to contribute 2,000 soldiers to Zhu's campaigns. (Subsequently, when Zhu sent Cui Xian back to Fengguo and demanded that he return with the 2,000 promised soldiers, Cui Hong's officer Cui Jingsi () assassinated Cui Xian and seized Cui Hong, fleeing to Yang's domain with him and the soldiers.) = Late rule = In spring 899, Yang Xingmi and Zhu Jin attacked Ganhua's capital Xu Prefecture (). Zhu Quanzhong, after first sending his officer Zhang Guihou () to try to relieve Xu, also personally led a relief force that trailed. When Yang heard of Zhu's impending arrival, he withdrew. In 900, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Yang the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In fall 901, rumors arrived at Yang's headquarters that Qian Liu had been assassinated. Believing the rumors to be true and believing that this would be his opportunity to seize Qian's capital Hang Prefecture, he sent Li Shenfu to attack Qian's Zhenhai Circuit. Qian sent his general Gu Quanwu () to resist, but Li Shenfu defeated and captured him. However, Li soon realized that Qian had not been assassinated and that he would not be able to capture more of Qian's territory. To ward off a Qian counterattack, he, who had captured Qian's hometown Lin'an (臨安, in modern Hangzhou) by this point, protected Qian's ancestral tombs and allowed Gu, whom Qian valued greatly, to write home; he also pretended a large Huainan reinforcement was on the way. After extracting a large amount of monetary award from Qian, he then withdrew. (Yang later returned Gu to Zhenhai in return for Qin Pei (), a Huainan officer who was captured when Qian recaptured Sū Prefecture.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. By late 901, the powerful palace eunuchs, upon learning of a plot between Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin to slaughter them, planned to kill Cui. In response, Cui summoned Zhu Quanzhong to the imperial capital Chang'an with an army. Upon hearing of Zhu's impending arrival, the eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui, seized Emperor Zhaozong and fled to the domain of Han's ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Zhu soon arrived in Chang'an's vicinity and, at Cui's urging, put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. With Fengxiang under siege, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict (possibly under the eunuchs' duress) in spring 902 to Yang, commissioning him as the overall commander of the circuits to the east, bestowing him the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (), and created him the Prince of Wu. The edict ordered Yang to attack Zhu from the east. (The edict was delivered by Li Yan, the son of the retired chancellor Zhang Jun, on whom Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the imperial surname of Li. Li Yan would subsequently remain in Yang's domain to serve as the Tang emperor's representative, although after Li Yan's arrival Yang also himself began exercising imperial authority, as the edict that Li Yan delivered authorized him to do so.) Yang thereafter prepared a campaign against Zhu. While Yang was preparing the campaign against Zhu, Tian Jun, who was by this point the military governor of Ningguo, was preparing an attack against Feng Hongduo, an officer of Zhang Xiong's who had continued to occupy Sheng Prefecture (昇州, i.e., Shangyuan) after Zhang's death, who had an impressive fleet. (Because of his fleet, Feng had refused to submit to Yang.) Tian built a fleet himself in preparation, and Feng decided to preempt him by attacking Ningguo's capital Xuan Prefecture with his fleet, despite Yang's sending messengers to urge him not to. When Feng engaged Tian, however, Tian defeated him and crushed his fleet. Feng, in light of his defeat, considered heading east out onto the East China Sea, but Yang persuaded him that he would be treated well if he submitted to Yang. Feng did so, and Yang commissioned him as deputy military governor of Huainan. Yang then sent Li Shenfu to serve as the prefect of Sheng. With the Feng threat over, Yang launched his attack on Zhu's domain, leaving Li Chengsi in charge at Huainan's headquarters. However, his army ran into food supply problems, as the large ships that he used to ship food supplies got stuck in the canals. (Xu Wen had suggested supplying the army with small ships instead, to no avail, but after this incident Yang began to value Xu's advice and began to promote him.) Subsequently, when the Huainan army attacked but could not capture Sù Prefecture quickly, Yang withdrew. (With Yang's campaign having failed, by 903 Li Maozhen was forced to kill Han and other eunuchs who followed Han and surrender Emperor Zhaozong to Zhu, to sue for peace. Zhu subsequently slaughtered the remaining eunuchs and took Emperor Zhaozong back to Chang'an and kept him under effective control.) In fall 902, Qian's officers Xu Wan and Xu Zaisi () mutinied against him and tried to take Hang Prefecture for themselves. When their initial attempt failed, they enticed Tian from coming to their aid. When Tian arrived at Hang Prefecture, he put it under siege and offered that if Qian would surrender it, he would be allowed to withdraw to Zhendong Circuit without further pursuit from Tian. Qian refused and, under Gu's suggestion, decided to enlist Yang's aid in stopping Tian (who was still Yang's vassal at this point). He sent Gu, with his son Qian Chuanliao (), to Huainan as emissaries. Gu pointed out to Yang that if Tian captured Zhenhai, his power would increase greatly and would threaten Yang's; instead, he offered that if Yang would order Tian to withdraw, Qian Liu would leave Qian Chuanliao as a hostage. Yang accepted the proposal and gave a daughter to Qian Chuanliao in marriage. Yang subsequently ordered Tian to withdraw, threatening that if he did not, Yang would send someone else to take over Ningguo. Faced with the threat, Tian withdrew after extracting a monetary payment from Qian and forcing Qian to surrender a son (Qian Chuanguan) as hostage. In spring 903, Yang sent Li Shenfu, assisted by Liu You (), to attack Du Hong's Wuchang Circuit. Meanwhile, Wang Shifan, who had similarly received an edict from Emperor Zhaozong to attack Zhu during the Fengxiang siege and who had acted on it, was now facing the overwhelming attack of Zhu's, and he sought aid from Yang. Yang sent Wang Maozhang to aid him and launched an attack on Sù Prefecture, but soon withdrew his attack from Sù. In addition, while Wang Maozhang initially had successes in conjunction with Wang Shifan in repelling the Xuanwu attack, soon, Wang Maozhang, determining that it would be impossible to indefinitely hold off the Xuanwu attack, withdrew from Pinglu, leaving Wang Shifan without further aid. By winter 903, Wang Shifan was forced to resubmit to Zhu. Meanwhile, it was said that Tian had become deeply resentful against Yang for forcing him to abandon Zhenhai. His resentment was furthered when he went to Yang Prefecture to meet Yang Xingmi to request that Chi and She Prefecture, both of which had previously belonged to Ningguo, be returned to Ningguo, and Yang refused. In summer 903, Tian and An Renyi (who was then still at Run Prefecture as its military prefect) together rose in rebellion against Yang; they eventually enticed Zhu Yanshou, who was then at Shou Prefecture and who carried the title of military governor of Fengguo, to join them as well (although Zhu Yanshou did not initially publicly state his intentions), and sent emissaries to Zhu Quanzhong, who also postured to attack Huainan to aid them. In face of the threat, Yang recalled Li Shenfu (who had been attacking Wuchang) to attack Tian and sent Wang Maozhang and Xu Wen to attack An. Yang, realizing that Zhu Yanshou was about to turn against him, pretended to have suffered a stroke and stated to his wife Lady Zhu that he would be entrusting the headquarters to Zhu Yanshou; she wrote Zhu Yanshou relaying Yang's remarks. Yang then summoned Zhu Yanshou to Yang Prefecture; believing Yang's sincerity, Zhu Yanshou went and was seized and executed by Yang, who then also executed Zhu Yanshou's brothers and divorced Lady Zhu. Meanwhile, Li Shenfu had initial successes against Tian's officers Wang Tan () and Wang Jian (). Tian therefore decided to depart Xuan Prefecture and engage Li Shenfu himself. At Li Shenfu's suggestion, Yang then sent Tai Meng to attack Xuan after Tian left Xuan. Upon hearing that Tai was about to arrive, Tian turned back to Xuan and engaged Tai. Tai sent letters in Yang's name to Tian's officers, who still bore allegiance to Yang, and then attacked, defeating Tian, who then fled back to Xuan Prefecture. Tai put Xuan under siege, and when Tian tried to counterattack, Tai defeated him and killed him. Yang, remembering his friendship with Tian, pardoned Tian's mother Lady Yin and continued to honor her as she was a mother. Further, he incorporated Tian's staff into his despite their earlier opposition to him. (An continued to hold out and would not be defeated and executed until spring 905.) With Tian defeated, Yang commissioned Li Shenfu as the new military governor of Ningguo, but Li Shenfu declined and resumed the campaign against Wuchang. (Instead, Yang commissioned Tai as governor (not military governor).) Yang also sent Gu and Qian Chuanliao, along with Qian Chuanliao's wife (his daughter) back to Qian Liu. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong had destroyed the city of Chang'an and forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang. On the journey to Luoyang, Emperor Zhaozong sent one final secret communique to Yang, Li Keyong, and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) to ask for them to make an attempt to rescue him; none of the three did. Still, when Zhu Quanzhong sent emissaries to try to persuade Yang to abandon the campaign against Wuchang, Yang sent back the response, \\"I will do so and rebuild my relationship with you if the Son of Heaven were restored to Chang'an.\\" In summer 904, Li Shenfu fell ill and died while attacking Wuchang; Yang replaced him with Liu Cun (). Meanwhile, Tai also died, and Yang replaced Tai with his oldest son Yang Wo. In winter 904, Zhu Quanzhong himself led an army to try to aid Wuchang and sent other officers to raid Huainan territory. He also sent Cao Yanzuo () to Wuchang's capital E Prefecture () to help Du defend it in light of Liu's siege. However, by spring 905, Liu had captured E Prefecture and taken Du and Cao prisoner; he sent them to Yang Prefecture, where they were executed, allowing Yang to incorporate Wuchang into his domain. Through the years, Zhao Kuangning remained in communications with both Yang and Wang Jian, a situation that eventually drew Zhu's anger. In summer 905, he launched a major attack against both Zhao Kuangning and his brother Zhao Kuangming, the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). The Zhao brothers were crushed; Zhao Kuangning fled to Huainan, and Zhao Kuangming fled to Xichuan. Zhu incorporated their domains into his. After his success, he decided to head east to attack Huainan, but after running into storms, withdrew. Meanwhile, Yang grew ill, and faced a succession problem. The natural successor would be his son Yang Wo, but the Huainan staff members all had low opinions of Yang Wo. When Yang Xingmi brought up the matter with his secretary Zhou Yin () and told Zhou to issue an order summoning Yang Wo back from Xuan Prefecture, Zhou opposed the idea, stating that he viewed Yang Wo as an inappropriate successor due to his love for drinking and games. Instead, Zhou suggested that Yang entrust the circuit to Liu Wei with the direction that after Yang's younger sons grew older that the circuit be given to one of them — a proposal that Xu Wen and Zhang Hao attacked as unworkable. When Yang again told Zhou to summon Yang Wo, Zhou drafted such an order but then delayed sending it. However, Xu and Zhang found the order and sent it, and Yang Wo arrived in Yang Prefecture in winter 905. Yang Xingmi commissioned him as the acting military governor of Huainan and soon thereafter died. At the Huainan staff members' request, Li Yan issued an order under Tang imperial authority making Yang Wo the new military governor of Huainan and overall commander of the eastern circuits, succeeding Yang Xingmi.

The name refers to Formosa, an alternative name for the island of Taiwan; it was chosen as the result of a contest held in September 2006 by the FSC. 15 names were suggested, intended to reflect special characteristics of Taiwan; two different Chinese-language versions of the name \\"Formosa bond\\" were suggested, as well as \\"C-Wang Bond\\" and \\"High-Tech Island Bond\\".

They are best known for their alternative rock hit songs \\"Respectfully King of Rain\\" and \\"Positively Lost Me\\" as well as their appearances in Pretty in Pink and Beverly Hills, 90210. The group's music has been diverse, touching on singer-songwriter, pop-rock, power-pop, roots rock, alternative rock, and alt-country, at well before the alt-country movement.Jimmer Podrasky, \\"The Book of Your Regrets promo CD liner notes\\", EPIC ESK 1104, 1988 Critic Ira Robbins described the Rave-Ups as having been \\"touted as the next big thing to erupt from the LA club scene\\" of the 1980s, but also dogged by legal and personal problems that hampered the band's success. Band history =Origins= The Rave-Ups were founded at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 1979 by Jimmer Podrasky (guitar/vocals), with Michael Kaniecki (guitar/vocals), George Carter (bass, violin, vocals), and T.J. Junco (drums). The original group lasted only through that fall when T.J. Junco left the band. Richard Slevin (drums) joined the group in January 1980 and helped the band develop through the year, and though the group was considered part of Pittsburgh's early punk/new wave scene, along with its sister group The Shakes/Combo Tactic. With a somewhat more polished style than many of their peers, The Rave-Ups were considered less an example of the Punk genre and more of a musical stew of punk, pop, country, blues and folk. The band performed mostly original songs written by Podrasky and Kaniecki, with some songs contributed by Carter, and a few covers. Early performances in Pittsburgh were at The Electric Banana, The Decade Lounge, functions at Carnegie Mellon, as well as regular gigs at Fat City in Swissvale. During the summer of 1980 the band made 4-track and 16-track studio recordings, including the later popular \\"Class Tramp\\" and \\"In My Gremlin,\\" along with the usual live recordings of club dates. Slevin left the band in the summer of 1980 to return to his native New York City and was replaced by Victor McPoland, a fellow Pittsburgher and Carnegie/Mellon grad. Meanwhile, the band left Pittsburgh and relocated briefly to Los Angeles, California. Appearing as the \\"band\\" in a John Wells (later of E.R. and The West Wing fame) production of Sam Shephard's \\"The Tooth of Crime,\\" the group spent eight weeks in the sun of Los Angeles before returning home to Pittsburgh. A later return to LA by the band didn't gel and the original members broke up soon afterward. Podrasky returned briefly to Pittsburgh, but eventually booked a flight back to Los Angeles in order to further the musical agenda already established by the Pittsburgh group. =Second incarnation (Class Tramp, Town + Country and Pretty In Pink)= The second incarnation of the band followed after Podrasky met drummer Tim Jimenez in the San Fernando Valley in 1982. Podrasky and Jimenez quickly became close friends and enlisted a bass player, Colleen Campbell, to join the band. Danny Zippi, already established as an actor, joined the group soon after and the band gigged around Los Angeles, almost always for free. Within the year, Campbell and Zippi were replaced by guitarist Chuck Wada & bassist Douglas Leonard. That line-up signed an indie deal and released a six- song EP entitled Class Tramp on Fun Stuff Records in 1983. The EP sold all 3,000 copies produced. But the Podrasky-Jimenez-Wada-Leonard line-up didn't last long. Late in 1984, Terry Wilson (guitar) and Tommy Blatnik (bass guitar) joined the band on a permanent basis. Ironically, all four members of the band now worked in the mailroom/shipping department of A&M; Records, and it was in the basement of the A&M; lot that the band rehearsed nightly, honing their craft amongst stacks of posters, album flats and music merchandising. In 1985, the band released their first full-length album, Town + Country, which was met with widespread critical acclaim and sold more than 40,000 copies. The album's only single, \\"Positively Lost Me,\\" became a college radio hit and cemented the band as thoughtful alt-rockers with an extremely accessible sound, smart songs, and a considerable fondness for country, blues and folk. Actress Molly Ringwald, who had become a friend and fan of the band through her sister Beth's relationship with Podrasky, introduced the band to moviegoers in the John Hughes' classic Sixteen Candles when her character's three-ring binder featured the name \\"The Rave-Ups\\" scratched on it with a ball point pen. Ringwald later invited director John Hughes to see the band at a club date where the band informally and successfully auditioned for an appearance in the movie Pretty in Pink. In the movie, the Rave-Ups play their song \\"Rave-Up, Shut-Up\\" on stage while Duckie (Jon Cryer) talks with Iona (Annie Potts) at a nearby table, just before Andie (Ringwald) and Blane (Andrew McCarthy) join them. The next song played by the Rave-Ups in this scene is \\"Positively Lost Me.\\" The band also appeared on the MTV \\"Pretty In Pink\\" Movie Premier Special performing \\"Positively Lost Me\\". That song became a cult hit big enough that Rhino Records included the song on Rhino's Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of The 80's - Vol. 12. During this time the band was getting major acclaim from critics including Robert Christgau, Robert Hilburn, J.D. Considine, Todd Everett and Roy Trakin and entered into talks with several major record labels. During their still-evolving musical peak, the band was locked in legal battles, all in the hope of moving on to a major label; from 1986 to 1987, little music was released, with the exception of a 12-inch single, \\"These Wishes\\" (later covered by Pittsburgh band, The Clarks). The poignant ballad \\"Big Wide River\\" was the B-side of the single, which was produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and engineer Mark Linnett. The band recorded a full-length album with Berlin and Linnett producing, but the record was never released. =Epic records (The Book of Your Regrets and Chance)= In 1987, the band signed to Epic Records and released their major label debut The Book of Your Regrets to high critical expectations, despite being only promoted to the college radio scene (albeit a burgeoning one). The album failed to sell many copies, due to Epic's corporate restructuring with Sony and lack of promotion. The label almost dropped the band but a few believers from Epic insisted that the band get another opportunity. That same year, their song \\"Class Tramp\\" appeared in the cult horror anthology film From a Whisper to a Scream. 1990 saw the release of the album Chance (named after Podrasky's son with Beth Ringwald) to slightly more commercial success. The single \\"Respectfully King of Rain\\" became a modest alternative rock hit, garnering some video airplay on MTV and peaking at No. 12 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, a radio-friendly pop anthem called \\"(She Says) Come Around\\" was readied for distribution (including a music video) by Epic who then decided that they would not promote the single or video and, soon after, dropped the band from the label. The band continued working for a few months, including an appearance on an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210 (\\"Spring Dance\\") and an opening slot on the Indigo Girls tour. Podrasky soon found himself in a brief relationship/engagement with 90210s star, Shannon Doherty; however, Podrasky's single-father status (he and Ringwald had split- up many months earlier) didn't gel with a Hollywood lifestyle and the relationship soon ended. Within months, after much frustration, The Rave-Ups unofficially broke up in 1992. =Post break up= In 1996-1997, Podrasky briefly formed the band The Lovin' Miserys with Concrete Blonde drummer Harry Rushakoff, producing the limited pressing CD Happy as Hell, which was released only to radio stations. During live shows, they were joined by bass player Sam Bolle from Agent Orange, though in the LA Times interview Jimmer said “On the album, it's just me and Harry Rushakoff.”In 2000, members of The Rave-Ups (Podrasky and Wilson) reformed, recording a CD entitled The Salmon in the Woods which has remained unreleased as of 2012. Over the years, Wilson has played on stage and in studio with many bands including the Springfield, Missouri all-star band, The Dog People and spending some time with The Ozark Mountain Devils. Jimenez continues to play with and produce various bands in Los Angeles. Blatnik has also spent time playing with The Dancing Hoods (whose guitarist Mark Linkous later formed Sparklehorse) and The Lonesome Strangers (featuring singer/songwriters Randy Weeks & Jeff Rymes). =Reformation and future developments= Podrasky and Wilson continued to maintain a musical partnership, writing and performing occasionally over the following years. In August 2007, with Jimenez and Blatnik back in the rhythm section, the band re- grouped to play some shows in the Los Angeles area. Since then, they've occasionally performed in southern California, but have yet to release any brand new material. Rumors of a new Rave-Ups record continue to tease diehard fans of the band. Jimmer Podrasky recorded his first solo album with drummer/producer Mitch Marine, guitarist/songwriter Brian Whelan and bassist/songwriter Ted Russell Kamp; the album is \\"The Would-Be Plans\\" and was released through JimmerMusic.com in September 2013. According to an interview with MSN Music, Podrasky had intended the album to be a Rave-Ups reunion but couldn't get the other band members on board. Though he had the right to release it as a Rave-Ups record, he felt it wouldn't be right, so it's his first official solo album. Podrasky has since recorded his second solo album and is working on its completion and release. In late 2015, The Rave-Ups approached Omnivore Recordings about re-releasing the \\"Town + Country\\" album as part of the 30th anniversary of the initial Fun Stuff Records release. On July 8, 2016, the re-release became a reality. This reissue of \\"Town + Country\\" features the original 10 songs, plus a whopping 11 previously unissued bonus tracks — including live radio performances recorded for Dierdre O'Donoghue's influential \\"SNAP\\" program on Los Angeles’ legendary KCRW-FM, as well as 1986 material produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and Mark Linett. A detailed historical essay from the band's Jimmer Podrasky, complemented by numerous unseen photos from the sessions/era, make this not only a document of time + place, but one that helps document a moment in musical history. Mastering and restoration was overseen by Grammy® winner Gavin Lurssen. According to Podrasky from the liners: “Music has the uncanny ability to thwart time and space. It informs a moment. It indexes lives. It creates strange bedfellows. It outlasts people — even the people who helped make the music. Music resonates more than any other art form — that is its unique power. It remains with us long after the last note has faded. \\"Town + Country\\" was the beginning of a lifelong journey for me — the start of a trip that still hasn’t ended. I’m proud and honored to have been a part of something that has withstood the test of time.” Town + Country is available at Rhapsody, iTunes and Amazon. Jimmer Podrasky is a first cousin of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John Roberts.

This committee did not have authority to represent the church on theological matters. The Biblical Study and Research Committee or Biblical Study Committee had been created on September 24, 1952. To a certain extent it took the place of the Biblical Research Fellowship, which was being dissolved at the time. The Bible Research Fellowship was an unofficial society of Adventist Bible teachers. It was planned in 1940, and was materialized in 1943.See R. A.

Also known as Christian Brothers' College, Yarraville, or more simply CBC Yarraville, the school for boys opened in 1942, closed in 1972, and was operated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers.  Early history  The school owes its early beginnings to the opening of St. Augustine's primary school in 1895. This early school was operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who, guided by the charism of Mary Mackillop, wished to help the poor of the area. At that time the wooden church building served a dual purpose as a school on weekdays, for nearly 200 pupils,Taig, C.M. (1985) St. Augustine's Yarraville, A history of Church and School. Quickset Press, Yarraville. Retrieved 14 December 2015 from http://www.staugustinesparish.org.au/files/history.pdf and a place of worship on Sundays. In 1896 the school was led by Sister Casimir and the nuns and their assistants taught mixed classes of boys and girls and it was not until much later that classes were strictly segregated. By 1930 around 900 students were being taught in the Parish school and the need to build more classrooms was increasing.Taig, C.M. (1985) St. Augustine's Yarraville, A history of Church and School. Quickset Press, Yarraville. Retrieved 14 December 2015 from http://www.staugustinesparish.org.au/files/history.pdf In 1941 a separate girls school was opened within the parish complexSt Augustine's Primary School – History (webpage) Retrieved on 26 November 2015 from http://www.sayarraville.catholic.edu.au/page/58/History and the need to cater for the boys became obvious.  1940s – 1950s  The Christian Brothers arrived in 1942 to take charge of the classes for boys. They adopted a modified version of the existing Congregational crest used by the Brothers to identify themselves. In 1946 the school enrolment stood at 240 boys in Grades 5 to 8, also known as Proficiency. The following year the school added a First Year Intermediate class to its curriculum. The names of some of the early headmasters include Br. H. Boylan, Br. E. S. Crowle (1946–1952) and Br. R. McCartney. A new residence was opened for the Brothers on Somerville Road in March 1949 but up until that time they travelled daily from the Brothers community at St. Joseph's North Melbourne by train to the Yarraville railway station.  Closure  The Christian Brothers' college closed in 1972, later to be reopened as an extension of St. Augustines Primary school. Following the withdrawal of the Brothers, the Avoca Street Campus was taken over by the Sisters of St Joseph who proceeded to operate the site as an extension of their Altona West school, Mount St. Joseph Girls' College. The handball courts and the ground floor class rooms of the other site were incorporated into the St Augustine's Primary School which had continued its operation on an adjoining site while the upstairs classrooms were incorporated into Mount St Joseph's campus. Following a review by the Sisters of St Joseph in 1975 it was decided that the campus was superfluous to their needs and this led to the opening of Yarraville Catholic Girls College.  Recognition  The school was particularly recognised in the city of Melbourne for the strength of its sporting teams, and the sportsmen it produced. For example, six members of the 1954 VFL premiership team (the Footscray Bulldogs) were old boys of St. Augustine's, including Doug Reynolds and Ted Whitten.St. Augustine's CBC Yarraville, Old Boys' Association – 40 Year Memories (Brothers Information Technology Services: Melbourne, 2004), p. 24.

His maternal great-grandfather was the poet Nou Kan (who wrote Teav-Ek, ទាវឯក, a version of Tum Teav, the masterpiece of Cambodian love poetry). He grew up speaking both French and Khmer. Throughout his youth, he immersed himself in the classical literature of Cambodia and, at the same time, the literature and the philosophy of the West. His first novel, A Meaningless Life, published in 1965 (he was 22 years old), was strongly influenced by Nietzsche, Freud, Sartre and Buddhist philosophy. It was an enormous success. Numerous novels and short stories followed, among them The Adventurer With No Goal, A Bored Man, We Die Only Once, and Dead Heart. He also worked as a journalist in Khmer Ekareach (The Independent Khmer), the newspaper of his uncle, Sim Var, and in the late 1960s, he founded (with Sin Kim Suy) the newspaper and publishing house, Nokor Thom (នគរធំ / The Great Kingdom). He was a militant nationalist who was both anti-Sihanouk and anti- communist. Through his newspaper, he supported the pro-American government of General Lon Nol before finally distancing himself and suddenly taking refuge in France in 1974, after the assassination of his friend, Thach Chea, the Deputy Minister of Education. His father and two of his brothers died during the Khmer Rouge regime. He worked in Paris as a taxi driver and published his dark cult novel The Anarchist, written in French. Later he and his two sons moved to the West Coast of the United States, where he now resides. His brother-in-law is Mam Sonando.

In 1989, he was elected vice general secretary of the Basic Education Student Union (BESU). He was dismissed from his school for his political involvement in student demonstrations, later jailed for 9 months for aiding in forming the Student Union. In 1994, the military intelligence tried to arrest him again because he published the All Burma Federation of Student Unions pamphlets and organized student demonstrations to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of 7 July Protests. Although he escaped, his home was searched frequently and his family was harassed incessantly while he was on his run. From behind the scenes, he took part in the 1996 student demonstrations and helped organized the student protests against the poor quality of education and students' rights in 1998. He was arrested in October 1998, and sentenced to 59 years in prison. At first, he was detained in Kalay Prison, Sagaing Division. He was moved to Khamti Prison, and transferred to the Mandalay Prison at 2004. Whilst in prison, he and his fellow prisoners of conscience were subjected to inhumane torture and withheld proper medical treatment. By placing him in Mandalay Prison, he was kept as far away from his family as possible. He, therefore, received few food parcels or medical supplies (families were often burdened with having to bring supplies and medicines to prisoners as the government did not provide some basic necessities). He contracted malaria and died in Mandalay prison on 16 October 2006. Thet Win Aung was elected Honorary Vice- President of the Reading University Students' Union after being adopted as their Amnesty International Group's prisoner.

It contains a mixture of tracks from different recording sessions; some tracks were recorded with Jeff Barry for an aborted third album for Atlantic Records, other tracks were recorded for Philips in the UK between April and July 1970 – these came to be Springfield's final recordings with longtime producer and arranger Johnny Franz. Some, such as \\"Willie and Laura Mae Jones\\", recorded with Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, had been previously released as singles in the US. See All Her Faces collects many of those tracks, recorded from 1969 to 1971, placing seven of the British recordings on Side A, while Side B comprises tracks recorded both in the UK and the US. As a result, the album has no cohesive sound, but offers many different styles of music. The album boasts eight producers, including Springfield herself. It has been suggested that See All Her Faces is best appreciated track by track, rather than as a whole stylistic statement, as her album Dusty in Memphis is often praised to be. The See All Her Faces album was never released in the US, and as a consequence the majority of the tracks recorded in the UK would remain unavailable in the States until the release of the Rhino Entertainment compilations Dusty in London and Love Songs – some thirty years later. In 2002, Mercury Records/Universal Music UK released See All Her Faces in its entirety on CD for the first time, then also including three bonus tracks; two further recordings from the shelved Faithful album with Jeff Barry and also Springfield's interpretation of \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\", written by Alan & Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand for the 1969 film The Happy Ending. Springfield recorded her version of the song during the See All Her Faces sessions in London in the summer of 1970, but it was left unheard in the Philips Records archives until 1994.

The male has a red rump, dark bars on the whitish flank and a scarlet eyebrow stripe. The female is duller and smaller than male; it also lacks the male's red eyebrow. The orange- breasted waxbill is found in grassland and savannahs south of the Sahara in Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. This species is also introduced to other countries, e.g., Kuwait. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, insects and shoots. The female usually lays between four and six eggs in an oval-shaped nest made from grass. These nests are often the old nests of red-collared widowbirds. Widespread and common throughout its large range, the orange-breasted waxbill is evaluated to be of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES in Ghana.

Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Ogden Whitney, the character first appeared in the Columbia Comics omnibus title Big Shot Comics #1 (May 1940). He is unrelated to the DC Comics character. The Skyman was Allan Turner, who was raised by his uncle to become \\"outstanding in mind and body.\\" A brilliant scientist, he had no superpowers but did have a flying wing-shaped airplane, dubbed the Wing, that flew by the power of Earth's magnetic poles. With this and money inherited from his late uncle's will, he fought crime. In 1944, he acquired an \\"Icarus-Cape\\", a huge pair of wings which allowed him to fly without an airplane. His love interest was detective Fawn Carroll. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Skyman fights ordinary criminals, saboteurs, mad scientists, cursed idols, Soviet scientists, Emma the Spy Queen, the Gremlin, and Nazis on the moon.\\" Publication history Cover of Skyman number 3 (Columbia Comics, 1947). Artwork by Ogden Whitney.The Skyman was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Ogden Whitney in the Columbia Comics omnibus title Big Shot Comics #1 (May 1940).Skyman at the Grand Comics DatabaseThough Ogden drew the first story and first cover, one source credits writer Fox and editor Vin Sullivan as creating the character in 1939, without giving specifics or the source of this information: After appearing in the first eight issues of Big Shot, the character was spun off into his own series, in which one issue each appeared in 1941, 1942, 1947, and 1948. The Skyman went on to appear in virtually every issue of Big Shot through issue #101 (May 1949). That comic itself lasted only three more issues. The Skyman additionally appeared in a story in Sparky Watts #1 (1942). New Media Publishing reprinted a Skyman story in the unnumbered one-shot Golden Age of Comics Special (Summer 1982). A.C.E. Comics' Return of the Skyman #1 (Sept. 1987) reprinted his origin from The Skyman #1 (1941) and published a new story written by Mort Todd with art by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko. Original artist Ogden Whitney penciled and inked a new cover based on his cover for The Skyman #1 from 1941. AC Comics ran reprints in Golden-Age Men of Mystery #7 and 23 (May 1998 and 2000), Golden-Age Treasury #2 (2003), and Men of Mystery Comics #66 (July 2007). He was among the large ensemble of public domain characters appearing in Dynamite Entertainment's Project Superpowers #0 and #3 (Jan. and May 2008), and Project Superpowers: Chapter Two #2, 5–6, with featured status in Project Superpowers: Chapter Two: Prelude and issues #7 and 10 (cumulatively Oct. 2008 – June 2010). Skyman is scheduled to appear in the Bounty Hunter series from Capture Comics.

It is typically found at elevations of in the Chihuahuan Desert and south into central Mexico, where it favors rocky habitats, occurring along roadsides as well. It is a perennial whose erect stems are somewhat woody at the base, and may reach in height. The leaves resemble those of the closely related Eschscholzia, being finely divided into many gray-green linear lobes. The flowers are solitary yellow cups formed from four overlapping petals, 5–7 cm across, vaguely resembling the unrelated tulip; the two sepals underneath typically fall away as the flower opens. The numerous stamens are short, with orange anthers. The long thin fruits are also reminiscent of Eschscholzia. The genus is named for English botanist and collector John Hunnemann (1760-1839). The Latin fumariifolia literally means \\"with leaves like Fumaria\\" (fumitory). It is widely cultivated, usually as an annual from seed. In colder climates it requires the shelter of a south-facing wall, in full sun. The cultivar 'Sunlite' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

He is a former President of the architectural section of the Venice Biennale (1979–92), Editor-in-chief of the journal Controspazio (1969–83), and dean of the Faculty of Architecture at the Politecnico di Milano university (1968–78). your bitcoinPortoghesi studied architecture at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Rome, completing his studies in 1957. He began teaching the history of criticism at the same faculty in 1961. Portoghesi opened an architectural practice with architect-engineer Vittorio Gigliotti (born 1921) in Rome in 1964. He has specialized in teaching and researching Classical architecture, especially Baroque architecture, and in particular Borromini, but also Michelangelo. His interest in more contemporary architecture coincided largely with that of his colleague in Rome, Bruno Zevi, in championing a more organic form of modernism, evident in, for instance, the work of Victor Horta and Frank Lloyd Wright, and in Italy with neorealism and the Liberty style. This attitude has continued throughout Portoghesi's career, and is clearly visible in his own architecture. It is also evident in his concern for the studies of nature, brought to the fore in his more recent book Nature and Architecture (2000).

Here’s how it might do that. Close Combat Lethality Task ForceColonel Daniel S. Roper, U.S. Army, Retired (2018) Regaining Tactical Overmatch: The Close Combat Lethality Task ForceBob Scales (November 26, 2018) Mattis’s Infantry Task Force: Righting ‘A Generational Wrong’ Classical The composition of a United States Army squad falls into three broad categories: classical, balanced and combined. United States Army 'classical' squads are composed of three elements; a command and support element, a base of fire element, and a maneuver element. The command and support element could include a squad leader, an assistant squad leader, a medic, a forward observer and a radio operator or it could be limited to a squad leader. The fire element consists of a machine gunner and one or two personnel who act as loaders and barrel changers for the gun and porters for its ammunition and ancillary components. The maneuver element is composed of troops armed with assault rifles, entrenching tools, grenades and additional ammunition for the machine gun and tasked with the role of enabling the safe movement of the fire element by scouting ahead and providing a security detail. Balanced Balanced squads are composed of two or three fire teams coupled with a command and support element. The fire teams could either be standard base of fire elements organized around a machine gun and protected by assault rifle or submachine gun wielding ammunition porters or the fire teams could be organized as 'storm' units composed of a handful of personnel armed with assault rifles reinforced with a squad automatic weapon and grenade launchers. Combined The combined squad is composed of dissimilar fire teams; an RPG team, a fire team and a sniper team. The RPG team consists of two personnel; one armed with an RPG launcher and the other porting extra RPGs and providing protection with an assault rifle. The fire team is composed of two personnel; one carrying a machine gun and the other porting its ammunition. The sniper team consists of one or two persons, one deploying the weapon, often a semi-automatic designated marksman rifle as opposed to a true sniper rifle, and the other acting as spotter and providing close protection. Combat Strategy and Phases =Assault= The two major techniques of squad assault are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of suppressive fire of supporting units. Bounded fire entails having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward. This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions. Advancing under the cover of supporting units requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire. Once the squad has closed with the enemy it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy. This allows sufficient disruption of the enemy's control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed. United States Marines squads are arranged into \\"Buddy Pairs\\" and will assault in \\"Buddy Rushes\\", ensuring that one Marine is firing at the enemy while the other is maneuvering. =Interim= In this phase the squad consolidates its position by entrenchment, construction of fortifications, creation of passageways between structures and forward reconnaissance of surrounding areas. Minor chemical decontamination will commence as seals, respirators and masks are checked for damage. Body armor will be examined to replace damaged ceramic plates. Casualties will be treated, evacuated and/or replaced. The squad will use this period to familiarise itself with its surroundings, dig in to defensible positions, recharge itself, repair any damage to itself and prepare either for the next offensive movement, or go on the defensive against a counterattack. =Defensive= On the defensive, an isolated squad will allow a small element to hold a weak and easily evacuated position behind a remote detonated mine, flanked by a machine gun. As the enemy advances, the small forward element will pull back. When its former position is overrun the mine will be detonated to distract the attackers, and then the machine gun will open fire on the attacker's flank. The machine gun will then switch to engage and suppress the tail of the enemy assault as the rest of the squad maneuvers against its dislocated and exposed flanks, which have been pulled forward from their defensive line to support the head of the assault. On the defensive, a squad with a secure means of communication will fix the enemy into interlocked fields of fire and call in fire support from supporting units.

After studying geology at the University of Sydney, Benson worked temporarily at the University of Adelaide before returning to Sydney as a demonstrator. After winning an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship in 1910 he left Sydney to study at the University of Cambridge, where he worked until 1913. He returned to Sydney in 1914 as the Macleay Fellow in Geology, leaving in 1917 to become Chair of the Geology Department at the University of Otago, where for many years he was the only lecturer. During his lifetime he published over 100 papers and won several awards, including the Clarke Medal and the Lyell Medal. He died on 20 August 1957 following his retirement from academia in 1951. Early life and education Benson was born on 26 December 1885 in Anerley to William Benson, a Quaker shipping manager, and his wife Emma Elizabeth Benson, who was also descended from another branch of the Benson family. Soon after his birth the family moved to Tasmania, where he studied at The Friends' School, Hobart between 1897 and 1902. After scientific training at the University of Tasmania he started studying Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Sydney in 1905, where he was taught by Sir Edgeworth David. His first paper, on the contact aureola of a granitic body, was published before he even finished his degree, and after graduating in 1907 with First Class Honours he temporarily worked as a Lecturer at the University of Adelaide. During this period he published three more papers, two on the petrology of Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks in the Barossa Ranges and one on the geomorphology of the Mount Lofty Ranges. Lecturer In 1909 he returned to the University of Sydney and became a demonstrator in the Geology Department. After winning an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship in 1910 he left Sydney in 1911 to work at the University of Cambridge, where he worked with John Edward Marr, Alfred Harker and Thomas George Bonney at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. In 1913 he was granted the BA (Research) degree by Cambridge and left, spending most of the year travelling Europe with his parents and sisters. He returned to the University of Sydney in 1914 to take up the Macleay Fellowship in Geology. In 1915 he became a lecturer at the Geology Department, and in 1917 he became Chair of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Otago, where he stayed until 1951. Despite spending the first nine years at Otago as the only lecturer in the Department of Geology, Benson still published several papers, most notably a work on the Cenozoic petrographic part of East Otago. During his lifetime he published over 100 papers. In 1921 he was made President of the geology section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, and from 1945 to 1947 was President of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He was awarded the Lyell Fund and Lyell Medal in 1937 and 1939 respectively by the Geological Society of London, the Hector and Hutton medals of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1933 and 1944, the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1945 and the Mueller Medal of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1951. In 1949 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1951 an honorary member of the Mineralogical Society of London. After retiring from the University of Otago in 1951 he continued to write papers, and at his death on 20 August 1957 was working on a revision to his paper on the Cenozoic Petrographic part of East Otago. His main influence, however, was in expanding the study of geology in Australasia.

He is referred to by some as the last Tamil king in Sri Lanka, who also rose to revolt against the British Ceylon empire and Dutch Ceylon empire, who died battling the British colonial rule on the island. He was officially declared a National Hero of Sri Lanka in 1982. Biography Kulasegaram Vairamuthu Pandara Vanniyan was a Vanniar of Vanni. Much remains unclear about his family, but reports state that he had one sister, Nallanachal Vanniyan, and two younger brothers called Kayilaya Vanniyan (Minister) and Periya Meynaar (Commander of the State). Pandara Vanniyan married Kumarasinghe Maha Vanniya’s family of present day Nuwara Wewa, who held the office of residential Governor and Custodian of the formerly Tamil area. Marriages between Vanniar Chieftain families in the northern and southern regions helped to unite and strengthen rule. Thus, when Pandara Vanniyan married into the Nuwara Wewa family, he gained political power in the south Vanni as well as in the north. It is said that he lived in Kumulamunai, which is today in Mullaitivu District. History Vanniar chieftain, Pandara Vanniyan, appeared to have paid some tribute to the more powerful rulers in the region at that time, who had an independent spirit and a distinct culture and dialect of their own. Vanni functioned as a buffer zone between the north and the south of Sri Lanka. Historically, the Vanni encompassed Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Ampara and Puttalam hinterlands. The name Vanni is said to be derived from the Sanskrit and Tamil word for forest (vannam) or fire (vahni), but there is also some historical evidence in Kalvettus(Stone Inscriptions) and classical songs that the Vanniar could have originally come from the large Vanniyar clan/ caste from North Arcot in South India. The beginnings of the people of the Vanni (Vanniar), who were ruled over by Vanniar Chieftains, has not been clearly established, but there is evidence of settlements in the region dating back 2000 years. Furthermore, there is information on the Konesar Kalvettu and in the old 'Vya' song of sixty Vanniar coming from Madurai in South India, accompanying the royal bride for the king at Anuradhapura in the first century BC. Conflict with colonial rule When the Jaffna Kingdom was captured by the Portuguese in 1621, the Vanni was under their nominal control and it is thought that 'Parangichetticulam' of the Vanni is the former fort of the Portuguese. Around 1782, the continued conflicts came to an end when the Dutch, who had by then arrived in Sri Lanka, once and for all defeated the Vanniars. It has been noted that \\"The Dutch met nowhere a more determined resistance than from one of the native princesses, the Vannichi (widow) Maria Sembatte, whom they [carried] away as prisoner, and [detained] in captivity in the Fort of Colombo.\\" The Flag of Pandara Vanniyan Pandara Vanniyan fought against the British colonial powers. The Vanniars commenced to live a wild and marauding life and carried on a predatory warfare against the British in Mannar and Trincomalee, and even penetrated to the Jaffna peninsula. The British had to build forts along the river to keep them at bay. In alliance with the Kandy Kingdom, Vanniyan started a revolt to expel the British from his district. On 25 August 1803, Vanniyan attacked the Government House in Mullaitheevu and drove out the garrison from Mullaitheevu, which was under the command of Captain Edward Mudge of the 19th Regiment, before finally seizing the fort. He captured the British cannons and overran the whole of the northern districts (Vanni), highlighting his boldness and ability to penetrate as far as Elephant Pass and into the Jaffna Peninsula. From conventional warfare, he resorted to guerrilla tactics, but was finally defeated by Lt. von Driberg when the (recently arrived) British organized a three-pronged attack from Jaffna, Mannar and Trincomalee in 1803. In that battle, the British also captured the cannon given to Pandara Vanniyan by Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe. The British presented the village of Pandara Kulam to Lt. von Driberg as a prize for defeating Pandara Vanniyan. This was followed by the \\"burning of all his houses, [whereby Pandara Vanniyan's] people ... dispersed into the jungle, and eventually out of the Vanni to the districts of Hanwella. The power of the Vanniar (Chieftains) was thus finally and effectually extinguished.\\" Alternative histories have it that Lt. von Driberg of the Dutch forces felt humiliated by Pandara Vanniyan for having been defeated by him several times, including in a personal combat situation; despite being permitted by senior officials to withdraw, he stayed on even after the British ousted the Dutch. Death Pandara Vanniyan was defeated in battle at the hands of Lt. von Driberg, in October 1803 at Oddusuddan, Katsilaimadu. Now no longer a feudal ruler, he withdrew to areas near the Kandy Kingdom. He remained there until September of 1810 where he was attacked in an ambush by British forces, and later succumbed to his injuries.ref> A granite stone monument commemorating Vanniyan's defeat was erected in the village Katsilaimadu in Vanni; it was placed in tribute by Lt. von Driberg, who had fought him in battle. The monument bears the inscription: \\"Here abouts Captain von Driberg Defeated Pandara Vawniyan Oct 31 st 1803.\\" In 2010 it was found broken; some Tamil media outlets reported that it had been damaged by Sinhalese soldiers in light of recent ethnic tensions and criticized it as an act of destruction of Tamil heritage and culture. Legacy Statue of Pandara Vanniyan, unveiled 10 August 2014. Pandara Vanniyan was declared a national hero by the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1982 and a statue of him was opened with much fanfare in Vavuniya at the main junction on the A-9 Highway, where the Jaffna and Kandy (and Colombo) road meets the road to Mannar. The Pandara Vanniyan Memorial Day falls on 25 August each year. Present-day Tamils and Sinhalese of North Central and North Western provinces in Sri Lanka, which were once part of Vanni, revere Pandara Vanniyan highly. The Sinhalese are known to summon the protection of Vanni Bandara Deio when they pass through jungles. Tamil nationalists valourise Vanniyan as an epic hero, and his character has recently been appropriated and measured against Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the now dismantled LTTE. Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi, an Indian politician and writer, in his novel 'Payum Puli Pandara Vanniyan' ('The Leaping Tiger Pandara Vanniyan' in English), uses Vanniyan to typify Tamil patriotism and transnationalism. According to Vijaya Ramaswamy in Historical Dictionary of the Tamils, \\"the course of the novel is ... connected to ... developments in Sri Lanka related to moves by the LTTE. The novel describes the mission of a friend of Veerapandiya Kattabomman (the last Poligar who resisted British rule in Tamil Nadu) to the Wanni jungles in Sri Lanka. His mission was to meet Pandara Vanniyan who was also resisting the British. This part of the novel echoes the meeting of V. Gopalsamy MP (popularly known as Vaiko) and Vellupillai Prabhakaran (leader of the defunct LTTE) in the dense jungles of Wanni.\\" Pandara Vanniyan is also the subject of the eponymous play by Mullaimaṇi Ve Cuppiramaṇiyam, 'Pantara Vanniyan.' The play was awarded a prize by the Ceylon Art Council in 1964, and was published thereafter in 1970. On 10 August 2014, three statues of former Tamil kings including Pandara Vanniyan, Ellalan, and Pararaja Sekaran were installed by Jaffna Clock Tower.

Christians believe that he was (and still is) divine, while Islam considers him to have been a prophet, messenger and the Messiah. Since the time in which he is said to have lived, a number of noted individuals have criticised Jesus. Early critics of Jesus and Christianity included Celsus in the second century and Porphyry in the third. In the 19th century, Friedrich Nietzsche was highly critical of Jesus, whose teachings he considered to be \\"anti-nature\\" in their treatment of topics such as sexuality. More contemporary notable critics of Jesus include Ayn Rand, Hector Avalos, Sita Ram Goel, Christopher Hitchens, Bertrand Russell, and Dayananda Saraswati. Criticism by Jesus' contemporaries =Disobedience of Mosaic law= The Pharisees and scribes criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing Mosaic Law. They criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating. (The religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them—, .) Jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans (). The Pharisees also criticized Jesus' disciples for gathering grain on the Sabbath (). =Claim to divine authority= The most striking characteristics of the utterances of Jesus were his claim to godhood, for which the Jews often attempted to stone him, and succeeded in handing him over to crucifixion, for committing blasphemy: > \\"“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for > blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.”Biblehub > John 10:33 There was also the tone of authority adopted by him and the claim that spiritual peace and salvation were to be found in the mere acceptance of his leadership. Passages like: \\"Take my yoke upon you . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls\\" (Matt. xi. 29); \\"whosoever shall lose his life for my sake . . . shall save it\\" (viii. 35); \\"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\\" (Matt. xxv. 40), indicate an assumption of power which is certainly unique in Jewish history, and indeed accounts for much of modern Jewish antipathy to Jesus, so far as it exists. On the other hand, there is little in any of these utterances to show that they were meant by the speaker to apply to anything more than personal relations with him; and it might well be that in his experience he found that spiritual relief was often afforded by simple human trust in his good-will and power of direction.Jacobs, Joseph et al. \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906 =Accusations of possession and madness= Jesus' family and contemporaries seriously regarded him as delusional, possessed by demons, or insane. The accusation contained in the Gospel of John is more literal. =Miracles and exorcisms performed by magic= In the latter half of the first century and into the second century, Jewish and pagan opponents of Christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus and his followers were the result of magic. Later criticism =Criticism of Jesus' mental health= A number of writers, including David Strauss, Lemuel K. Washburn, Oskar Panizza and Friedrich Nietzsche,Nietzsche, Friedrich, The Antichrist, § 31, 32. have questioned Jesus' sanity by claiming he was insane for believing he was God and/or the messiah. Psychologists and psychiatrists Georg Lomer, Charles Binet-Sanglé, William Hirsch, Georges Berguer, Y. V. Mints, Władysław Witwicki, William Sargant, Raj Persaud, and Anthony Storr, have said Jesus suffered from religious delusions and paranoia. =Criticism of Jesus' teachings= Slavery Avery Robert Dulles held the opinion that \\"Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution\\", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either. In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, \\"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery.\\" Giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that Jesus approved of slavery.Giles, Kevin. \\"The Biblical Argument for Slavery: Can the Bible Mislead? A Case Study in Hermeneutics.\\" Evangelical Quarterly 66 (1994): p. 10 http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1994-1_003.pdf In certain major non- English translations, the first statement in the first sermon of Jesus (Luke 4:18),https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm is a call to free the slaves: \\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war,....\\" (see Cornilescu translation). Sexuality and humility Nietzsche considered Jesus’ teachings to be \\"unnatural\\". Friedrich Nietzsche, a 19th- century philosopher, has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity, even going so far as to style himself as The Anti-Christ. In Human, All Too Human, and Twilight of the Idols for example, Nietzsche accuses the Church's and Jesus' teachings as being anti-natural in their treatment of passions, in particularly sexuality: \\"There [In the Sermon on the Mount] it is said, for example, with particular reference to sexuality: 'If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.' Fortunately, no Christian acts in accordance with this precept...Friedrich Nietzsche, 1895, Twilight of the Idols, Morality as Anti- nature, 1. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.\\"Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83. Nietzsche does explicitly consider Jesus as a mortal, and furthermore as ultimately misguided, the antithesis of a true hero, whom he posits with his concept of a Dionysian hero. Nietzsche was repulsed by Jesus' elevation of the lowly: \\"Everything pitiful, everything suffering from itself, everything tormented by base feelings, the whole ghetto-world of the soul suddenly on top!\\" However Nietzsche did not demur of Jesus, saying he was the \\"only one true Christian\\". He presented a Christ whose own inner life consisted of \\"blessedness in peace, in gentleness, in the inability for enmity\\". There is much criticism by Nietzsche of the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ's evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of God is within you.The Antichrist, § 34 \\"What are the 'glad tidings'? True life, eternal life is found—it is not promised, it is here, it is within you: as life lived in love.... 'Sin', every kind of distancing relationship between God and man, is abolished - precisely this is the 'glad tidings'. The 'glad tidings' are precisely that there are no more opposites....\\" Ignorance and anger Dayananda Saraswati, a 19th-century philosopher and the founder of Arya Samaj, in his book Satyarth Prakash, criticized Christianity and described Jesus as a \\"great thing in a country of uneducated savages\\": > \\"All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peace-loving > person. But in reality he was a hot-tempered person destitute of knowledge > and who behaved like a wild savage. This shows that Jesus was neither the > son of God, nor had he any miraculous powers. He did not possess the power > to forgive sins. The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator > like Jesus. Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the > world. Therefore, it is evident that the hoax of Christ’s being the Son of > God, the knower of the past and the future, the forgiver of sin, has been > set up falsely by his disciples. In reality, he was a very ordinary ignorant > man, neither learned nor a yogi.\\"\\"Hindu Nationalists of Modern India\\" by > Jose Kuruvachira, p. 20 Saraswati asserted that Jesus was not an enlightened man either, and that if Jesus was a son of God, God would have saved him at the time of his death, and he would not have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments. Noting that the Bible writes that women held the feet of Jesus and worshiped him, he questions: > \\"Was it the same body which had been buried? Now that body had been buried > for three days, we should like to know why did it not decompose?\\" Unfulfilled predictions of the second coming In the 1927 essay Why I Am Not a Christian, Bertrand Russell pointed to parts of the gospel where Jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners (). He concludes from this that Jesus' prediction was incorrect and thus that Jesus was \\"not so wise as some other people have been, and He was certainly not superlatively wise\\".Russel, Bertrand (1927). Why I am not a Christian in \\"Why I am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects,\\" 2004, Routledge Classics, p.13. Though Russell believed Jesus 'had a very high degree of moral goodness', he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character. In his essay he wrote: : > There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ's moral character, and > that is that He believed in hell. I do not myself feel that any person who > is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment. Christ > certainly as depicted in the Gospels did believe in everlasting punishment, > and one does find repeatedly a vindictive fury against those people who > would not listen to His preaching -- an attitude which is not uncommon with > preachers, but which does somewhat detract from superlative excellence. You > do not, for instance find that attitude in Socrates. You find him quite > bland and urbane toward the people who would not listen to him; and it is, > to my mind, far more worthy of a sage to take that line than to take the > line of indignation.Why I am not a Christian By Russell Russell also expresses doubt over the historical existence of Jesus and questions the morality of religion: \\"I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.\\" Proscribing virtue and prohibiting vice Novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand denounced the altruist recipe that Jesus passed down to his pupils, and with it the idea of vicarious redemption. She thought that even Christians, who think of Jesus in the highest possible terms, should feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice. Not surprisingly, her understanding of love as a consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values considers the ideas Jesus is most famous for as immoral. Consider the following excerpt from a 1959 interview conducted by Mike Wallace: > Wallace: Christ, every important moral leader in man's history, has taught > us that we should love one another. Why then is this kind of love in your > mind immoral? > Rand: It is immoral if it is a love placed above oneself. It is more than > immoral, it's impossible. Because when you are asked to love everybody > indiscriminately. That is to love people without any standard. To love them > regardless of whether they have any value or virtue, you are asked to love > nobody. Notwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife, Rand saw Jesus' insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates, including Christian altruism. In For the New Intellectual, Rand further accuses Judeo-Christian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality. \\"The evils for which they damn him [man] are reason, morality, creativeness, joy — all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn. They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.\\" And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult: \\"No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body.\\"  Foundation of Western imperialism and the Holocaust  Historian and Hindu activist Sita Ram Goel accused Jesus of being the intellectual author behind Western imperialism and the Holocaust. Goel further writes that Jesus \\"is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression. He does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness.\\" He made his case based on the gospels, which he thought cast too dark a shadow on unconverted Jews (see for instance ). From there he drew parallels between Jesus and Adolf Hitler, the latter of whom was, in Goel's words, the first to \\"completely grasp the verdict passed on the Jews by the Jesus of the gospels\\". Ram Goel also ridiculed what he termed \\"the cult of the disentangled Christ\\", whereby Christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of Jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired — and only from the bad ones — as though missionary proselytism and Western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence. Eternal punishment of hell Hitchens Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens, one of the leading exponents in the \\"New Atheism\\" movement, was extremely critical of Jesus, Christianity and any religion in general. Regarding Jesus' teachings on hell, Hitchens wrote: > \\"The god of Moses would call for other tribes, including his favorite one, > to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation, but when the grave > closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he > remembered to curse their succeeding progeny. Not until the advent of the > Prince of Peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and > torturing the dead.\\"Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great, (2007) pages: > 175–176 Hitchens also felt that a divine Jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the problem of evil, asking: > \\"If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened to meet, then why not heal > blindness?\\"Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great, (2007) page: 3 Attitude toward non-Jews Sam Harris, author of The End of Faith, has expressed ambivalent views on Jesus' teachings. He argues that while Jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times, he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric law of the Old Testament, and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics. To Harris, Jesus' unresolved frustration and hatred of non-Christians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates, and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell. He wrote: : > In addition to demanding that we fulfill every \\"jot\\" and \\"tittle\\" of Old > Testament Law, Jesus seems to have suggested, in John 15:6, further > refinements to the practice of killing heretics and unbelievers: \\"If a man > abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men > gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\\" Whether we > want to interpret Jesus metaphorically is, of course, our business. The > problem with scripture, however, is that many of its possible > interpretations (including most of the literal ones) can be used to justify > atrocities in defense of the faith.Sam Harris, The End of Faith, (2004) page > 83 To the same end of exposing Jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell, Harris quotes Luke's version of the parable of the talents,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82YIluFmdbs which ends with the nobleman character saying: : > \\"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, > bring hither, and slay them before me.\\"s:Bible (King James)/Luke#19:27 Which is taken to be a self-portrait of Jesus and his own eschatological views.Finley, Tom.

Ethical teachings in light of modern ethical standards Hector Avalos is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write a systematic critique of the ethics of Jesus in his book, The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics. Koowon Kim, an associate professor in the Old Testament at Reformed Graduate University in South Korea remarks in his review of The Bad Jesus: \\"Whether or not one agrees with the author’s conclusions, this book is the first systematic challenge to New Testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the Hebrew Bible and its ancient Near Eastern context and well-versed in New Testament and Early Christianity.\\" In a review in Bilbilcal Theology Bulletin, Sarah Rollens, a New Testament scholar at Rhodes College, remarks: \\"Hector Avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of Jesus based on New Testament texts are morally or ethically problematic, but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize, explain away, or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards.\\" =Criticism of Jesus' life= Historicity While most scholars agree that the baptism of Jesus and the crucifixion of Jesus really happened,Jesus of Nazareth by Paul Verhoeven (2010) p. 39 they do not agree on the historical reliability of the Gospels, but believe many of the words and actions attributed to Jesus are interpolation. David Strauss said Jesus' miracles were myths.Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth by Michael J. McClymond, Eerdmans 2004 page 82 Johannes Weiss and William Wrede both said that Jesus' messianic secret was a Christian invention.Mark as Story: Retrospect and Prospect by Kelly R. Iverson, Christopher W., Skinner, Society of Biblical Literature 2011) p. 183 Albert Kalthoff believed Jesus' claims to divinity and his humble beginnings were two different accounts. Arthur Drews said Jesus did not exist at all, but was simply a myth invented by a cult. Incarnation The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry of Tyre (c. 232–c. 304) authored the 15 volume treatise Against the Christians, proscribed by the Emperors Constantine and Theodosius II, of which only fragments now survive and were collected by Adolf von Harnack. Selected fragments were published in English translation by J.

Dominic Janes, Romans and Christians, page 51 (Tempus, 2002). Gospel accounts of Jesus' life Celsus, 2nd-century Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity, mounts a wide criticism against Jesus as the founder of the Christian faith. He discounts or disparages Jesus' ancestry, conception, birth, childhood, ministry, death, resurrection, and continuing influence. According to Celsus, Jesus' ancestors came from a Jewish village. His mother was a poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth. He worked his miracles by sorcery and was a small, homely man. This Rabbi Jesus kept all Jewish customs, including sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. He gathered only a few followers and taught them his worst habits, including begging for money. These disciples, amounting to \\"ten boatmen and a couple of tax collectors\\" were not respectable. The reports of his resurrection came from a hysterical female, and belief in the resurrection was the result of Jesus' sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers, all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars.Robert E. Van Voorst, Jesus outside the New Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 65-66Raymond Edward Brown, Mary in the New Testament, Paulist Press, 1978. pp 261-262 According to Celsus, Jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution. Celsus stated that Jesus was the bastard child of the Roman soldier Panthera or Pantera.Origen, Contra Celsus1.32 These charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the Jewish charge that Jesus was conceived as the result of adultery (see Jesus in the Talmud) and that his true father was a Roman soldier named Panthera. Panthera was a common name among Roman soldiers of that period. The name has some similarity to the Greek adjective parthenos, meaning \\"virgin\\".James D. Tabor, The Jesus Dynasty: The Hidden History of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity, Simon and Schuster, 2006. p 64Robert E. Van Voorst,Jesus outside the New Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 67-68 The tomb of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera, found in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, is taken by some scholarsJames Tabor, The Jesus Dynasty (2006), pages. 64-72 to refer to the Pantera named by Celsus. According to Celsus, Jesus had no standing in the Hebrew Bible prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness. =Criticism by other religions= Criticism in Judaism Judaism, which includes Orthodox Judaism, Haredi Judaism, Hasidic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Samaritan Judaism, entirely rejects the idea of Jesus being a god, a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God who has a special relationship with Him that somehow makes Jesus \\"divine\\". Moreover, it is Avodah Zarah (\\"foreign worship\\", which means idolatry) to regard or worship a human being as God; in Judaism, as well as in Islam, God is only One, totally transcendent, and cannot be human (Exodus , Deuteronomy , ). Judaism also holds that Jesus could not be the Jewish Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the Messianic prophecies foretold in the Tanakh, nor did he embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah foretold by the Prophets. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE.Simmons, Shraga, \\"Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus\\", Retrieved April 15, 2007; \\"Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus\\", Ohr Samayach — Ask the Rabbi, Retrieved April 15, 2007; \\"Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?\\", AskMoses.com, Retrieved April 15, 2007\\"The Hammer of God\\" Page 34 by Stephen Andrew Missick Thus Judaism is critical of Jesus' own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the \\"son of God\\", as presented in the New Testament, and considers Jesus to be just one of many individuals who claimed to be the Messiah, but did not fulfill any of the Messianic prophecies; therefore, they were all impostors. The Mishneh Torah, one of the most authoritative works of Jewish law, written by Moses Maimonides, provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12 that Jesus is a \\"stumbling block\\" who makes \\"the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God\\".

He was a close confidant of the then Prince Norodom Sihanouk but had a falling-out with the Prince when he was exposed in corruption, selling import licenses and a second time during his tenure as a Cambodian ambassador to London in 1958, for beating his pregnant servant. He was alleged to have beaten her so badly that she escaped to the protection of the London police. The scandal made headlines in the London tabloids and he was recalled to Cambodia and stripped of all of his duties. He disappeared mysteriously in 1962.  Political life  Sam Sary was Deputy Prime Minister in Prince Norodom Sihanouk's government in the 1950s. He played an important role in seeking full independence for Cambodia, in helping the newly independent Cambodia avoid partition at the Geneva conference (1954), and in helping King Norodom Sihanouk found the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (1955 onwards). He was involved in election fraud and intimidations, Keng Vannsak recalled: > The evil genius behind the repression was Sam Sary—a bestial man. As an > investigating magistrate in the 1940s, he had beaten suspects to death with > his own hands. Then he went study in France. In 1955, he joined the Sangkum > and became Sihanouk's closest aide ... After Sihanouk decided to use strong- > arm tactics, Sary handed out money and arms to hire ruffians to come and > break our meetings. =The Sam Sary Affair= In January 1958, Sam Sary was appointed by Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodia's ambassador to London, thus extricating him from a scandal involving smuggling of large quantities of high grade Cambodian pepper. According to Time magazine, he brought an entourage of four woman who were his official wife, with their five children, including Sam Rainsy and three mistresses. Six months later, Sam Sary was involved in another scandal when one of his female servants—Iv Eng Seng, who bore him a child—went to the London police, accusing him of severely beating her for \\"minor mistakes\\". By other accounts, her name was Soeung Son Maly and she used to date Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), later dumping him for more prosperous Sam Sary.Philip Short, Anatomy of Nightmare 2006 p. 82 Sam Sary was recalled to Phnom Penh, but not before he had put his side of the story to the British press. He admitted to having beaten his servant,saying: > I corrected her by hitting her with a Cambodian string whip. I never hit her > on the face, always across the back and the thighs—a common sort of > punishment in my country. He argued his right to do so because > the embassy is \\"Cambodia in London.\\" After coming back to Cambodia, Sam Sary became more and more anti-Sihanouk. Despite the risk of incurring Sihanouk's displeasure, Sam Sary started a newspaper, openly critical of the Prince's policies. He tried to start his own political party but without success. His anti-Sihanouk activities were dubbed the Sam Sary Affairs. Some commentators contend that Sam Sary worked with U.S. intelligence services, which he might have contacted in 1956 while visiting the U.S. On 13 January 1959, in a speech delivered in Kampong Cham, Sihanouk told his listeners that he knew about U.S. intelligence plots to overthrow him. While this speech had not clearly implicated Sam Sary, a week after the speech was delivered, he fled to Thailand. After a shadowy existence in exile, he disappeared in 1962. His son Sam Rainsy asserts that his father was killed in Pakse, Laos on the orders of Son Ngoc Thanh in late 1962 or early 1963.

Originally published in two volumes in 1797 (Volume 1) and 1799 (Volume 2), respectively, the full title is Hyperion; or, The Hermit in Greece (German: \\"Hyperion; oder, Der Eremit in Griechenland\\"). Each volume is divided into two books, with each second book including an epigraph from Sophocles. The work is told in the form of letters from the protagonist, Hyperion, to his German friend Bellarmin, alongside a few letters between Hyperion and his love Diotima in the second volume of the novel, and is noted for its philosophical classicism and expressive imagery.  Origin  1911 German edition Hölderlin began working on Hyperion in 1792, as a 22-year-old student at the Tübinger Stift. He further developed it while serving as a Hofmeister on the estate of Charlotte von Kalb, and put finishing touches to the novel while receiving lectures from Johann Gottlieb Fichte at the University of Jena.  Plot  Hyperion is set in Greece and deals with invisible forces, conflicts, beauty, and hope. It recounts Hyperion's attempts to overthrow the Turkish rule in Greece (in one of the footnotes Hölderlin specifically ties events in the novel with the Russians \\"bringing a fleet into the Archipelago\\" in 1770, framing the novel's events into the Orlov Revolt), his disillusionment with the rebellion, survival in the deadly Battle of Chesma, his devastation when Diotima dies of a broken heart before they can be reunited and his subsequent life as a hermit in the Greek wilderness, where he embraces the beauty of nature and overcomes the tragedy of his solitude.  Legacy  The work contains Hyperions Schicksalslied (\\"Hyperion's Song of Fate\\"), an interpolated poem on which Johannes Brahms composed the Schicksalslied, Op. 54 between 1869 and 1871. Italian composer and conductor Bruno Maderna composed between 1960-1969 opera Hyperion after Hölderlin novel. Italian composer Luigi Nono includes passages from Hyperion in his work Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima for string quartet as part of the score to be \\"sung\\" silently by the performers while playing the piece. In 1983, the German sculptor Angela Laich created a sculpture named Hyperion, after the main character of the Hölderlin novel. Hyperion is included in the 2006 literary reference book 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. English translations of Hyperion * Hyperion or The Hermit in Greece translated by Willard R.

Health Care Program seeks to improve access to regular, sustainable and affordable sources of quality health care for low-income adults and children, with a focus on community clinics and uninsured individuals. Housing and Neighborhoods Program concentrates on increasing access to affordable housing, and efforts that emphasize multiservice, geographically focused approaches to improve conditions in underserved neighborhoods. In conjunction with the program, the Community Foundation Land Trust of CCF buys land, works with private and public partners that obtain financing and approvals to build, and then ensures that they remain affordable homes for decades to come. Foundation grants are also made on a limited basis to nonprofits for adults with developmental disabilities, aging adults, animal welfare, disaster relief, and transitional- age foster youth. Donor advised grants comprise the majority of annual grantmaking by CCF and may be directed to worthwhile causes and qualified organizations anywhere in the world.

(March 7, 1910 – February 8, 2006) was a Canadian jazz musician and bandleader whose big band Mart Kenney and His Western Gentlemen was Canada's premier dance band during the 1930s and 1940s. Musical career Kenney was born in Toronto, the son of Mildred Agnes (Martin) and Herbert Kenney.http://bcradiohistory.radiowest.ca/Biographies/Kenney.htm Kenney established himself as a leading alto and baritone saxophonist and clarinetist in the 1920s as a member of the CJOR Radio Orchestra and as a sideman to Len Chamberlain at the Hotel Vancouver. The Western Gentlemen were first formed in 1931 as a result of an engagement at Vancouver's Alexandra Ballroom, for which he recruited trumpeter-pianist Glen Griffith, trumpeter Jack Hemmings, saxophonist Bert Lister and bassist Hec MacCallum, who would later be joined by drummer Ed Emel and vocalist-saxophonist-pianist Art Hallman. Following their CJOR radio debut in 1934, the band embarked on a three-year run at the Waterton Glacier International Peace Park in Waterton Park, Alberta, adopting as its theme song the 1922 Billy Hill-Larry Yoell waltz, \\"The West, a Nest and You, Dear\\". Kenney and his band gained a foothold in network radio in 1935 with the CRBC/CBC program 'Sweet and Low' which in turn led to cross-country tours and regular appearances at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. In 1938 the band began recording with RCA and by 1951 it had recorded some 25 78s for RCA Victor and Bluebird Records, as well as two for Dominion, featuring such hits as \\"The West, a Nest and You, Dear\\", \\"There's Honey on the Moon Tonight,' and the Kenney original 'We're Proud of Canada'. While originally a septet, Kenney toyed his band's lineup frequently, enlarging it to as many as 30 musicians on some of his recordings. See \\"Appendix A~ Mart Kenney's Musicians\\" in Mart Kenney and his Western Gentlemen for additional details. Western Gentlemen's guitarist (Summer 1937-1942) Tony Bradan married former Western Gentlemen's vocalist (1940-late 1943) Judy Richards. Retirement from music and municipal career Kenney's semi-retirement and relocation to Mission, British Columbia, saw the end of the Western Gentlemen. However, he continued to organize orchestras for special occasions such as CBC TV's In the Mood in 1971, and a Canadian National Exhibition appearance in 1975, and for engagements throughout the 1980s in the Vancouver area. In Mission, Kenney took up the real estate business and ran successfully for municipal councillor, while also volunteering extensively with the National Parole Board, Corrections Canada, the Mission Chamber of Commerce and the BC Lions Society for Crippled Children and served on an advisory council for Mission medium security institution For his efforts on behalf of the community he was honoured with the status of Freeman of the municipality in 1979 and Citizen of the Year in 1981. In 1992 he was honoured with the title of Senior Citizen of the Year in British Columbia and in 1996 was made Mission's Ambassador-at-large. During his tenure on council, he helped establish a reserve fund with profits from the municipality's tree farm to support arts and culture in the community.\\"Street Stories: Kenney Avenue, Mission Community Museum website, page 2 Kenney was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1980, and in 1985 was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Lethbridge. In 1995, he reprised his wartime concert performances when he conducted a dance band at the Bay Street Armoury in Victoria, BC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The following year, he released a new album, Mart Kenney: the 78 rpm Years, containing twenty-two of the songs previously recorded with his band in times past. Federal politics Kenney attempted to enter politics in 1968 but lost the Liberal nomination in York North to Barney Danson who went on to serve as a cabinet minister under Pierre Trudeau. Family Kenney had three children. His first wife was Rosetta Matilda Smillie.http://www.lifetimelearningcentre.org/people-of-mission/kenney- herbert-martin-mart-1910-2006/http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/h/u/n/Laurie-Jean- Hunt-BC/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0062.html In addition to instrumentalists, Kenney also featured numerous singers over the years, most notably Norma Locke, whom Kenney married in 1952 and who performed with Kenney from 1944 until his retirement in 1969. Norma, who died of cancer in 1990, was also instrumental in community affairs, having helped create the Mission Heritage Association, and being the driving force for the creation of the Fraser River Heritage Park.Street Stories: Kenney Avenue, Mission Community Archives site, page 1 Jason Kenney, Calgary Southeast Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2016, cabinet minister under Prime Minister Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2015, and Premier of Alberta since 2019, is Mart Kenney's grandson. Death and legacy Often referred to as \\"one of Canada's national treasures\\", Kenney died on February 8, 2006, aged 95, following a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia in Mission, BC. The District of Mission commemorated the contributions of the Kenneys by naming Kenney Avenue, which runs off Oyama Avenue near the Mission Sports Park, which is near their former home.

The method was named after its inventor, Charles L. Richards. One of the distinct advantages of this method over conventional finite state machine design methods is that it allows for easier design of complex finite state machines than the traditional techniques of state diagrams, state transition tables and Boolean algebra offer. Using Richards's technique, it becomes easier to implement finite state machines with hundreds or even thousands of states.  History  The Richards controller was developed because of the need for an easier method of designing finite state machines than using the traditional method of state diagrams, state transition tables, and logic minimization. At the time, many of the computer based logic minimization tools that we have today did not exist. Hence, logic minimization was for the most part limited to the use of Karnaugh maps and DeMorgan's law. Because of this, Charles L. Richards invented a method of implementing a finite state machine that did not need an explicit state transition table. He published his findings in the February 1973 issue of Electronics. His generalized implementation became popular and by the 1980s was considered a classic design method. While it is unlikely that commercial products found today contain a classic Richards controller (since there are faster designs now than ones that use loadable counters), there is a good chance of a modified Richards controller or a design derived from the Richards controller being used.  Applications  Because of the Richards controller's ability to scale to use many states easily, it can be used in many practical applications.  The Richards flowchart  Simple Condition and Functions Simple Richards Flowchart The Richards controller is a Mealy machine since its output is dependent on both the current state and the input. However Richards designed his own method of representing states using a flowchart diagram, instead of the state diagram. Each state is represented as a transfer condition on the flowchart. Each condition has two control paths leading out of it, a YES or a NO. The condition is YES or NO (TRUE or FALSE) based upon a single bit input to the machine. (Richards p. 108) Depending on what the input for a condition is, one of the two transfer functions associated with that condition will be executed. The machine considers executing a function to be setting the output of a single pin on the device, this can be used to trigger combinational logic. After a transfer function is executed, the machine will enter a new state, each transfer function will either implicitly or explicitly define a new state to transition to. An implicit state definition could also be called the default, since it will occur without any additional circuitry from the designer, if the condition is YES then it will transition to the next state numerically. For example, if you are at state 0 and a YES occurs then you will transition to state 1. If the condition is NO, then the machine will remain at its current state. Using this behavior it is possible to create a machine with a simple sequential flowchart. Of course a sequential machine is usually not very useful, thankfully there is a way to transition to states out of order, using a so-called jump. To implement a jump requires additional hardware to select the destination state. The exact hardware depends on the function being executed.  Kernel of the controller  Schematic for basic Richards controller The Richards controller's core kernel can be boiled down into four parts, a counter, a multiplexer, and two decoders. A simple controller can be built using the classic 7400 series of TTL logic integrated circuits. The counter used is the 74163, the multiplexer is the 74151 and the two decoders are the 7442 part. (Richards, p. 108) The output from the counter selects what bit from the multiplexer input should be sent to the output Y, (the inverse of which is sent to the output WN.) If Y is high, then the counter is allowed to increment, otherwise it is not. Likewise, Y must be high to enable YES function outputs since the D input on the decoder is connected to WN, while it must be low to enable the NO function outputs, since the D input on that decoder is set to Y. To perform a jump, you must set the LDN bit on the counter, and the A, B, C and D inputs. LDN tells the counter to load the value on the A, B, C and D inputs. Using some combinational logic, you can load a value into the counter for certain functions but not others, as well as specifying the state address to be loaded, given what function is active. Doing this is a simple matter of building a table of functions and the states that they should transition to, then finding the Boolean Algebra expression for each bit that makes up the address of the state to be jumped to.

He came to the United States as a young man in 1854. first finding work in the brewing industry in New York, Louisville, and Cincinnati. He moved to Newport, Kentucky in 1870. He was the founder of the George Wiedemann Brewing Company, which became Kentucky's largest brewery. It was located at 601 Columbia Street in Newport, Kentucky. Wiedemann beer was synonymous with Newport. Wiedemann promoted itself as \\"America's only registered beer\\" and often used humorous radio commercials as part of its advertising campaigns. George Wiedemann Brewery Complex, Bottling Shop at Sixth and Columbia Streets, Newport, KY Wiedemann married Agnes Rohman and they had six children. Newspaper accounts described Wiedemann as an honest man with a natural sociability and a dignified businessman. On May 28, 1890, George Wiedemann became ill and died at his home at 188 East Third St in Newport. The business was continued to operate by his sons, George Jr. and Charles. Wiedemann Brewing was merged with G. Heileman Brewing Company, in 1967 and was operated as Wiedemann Division, G. Heileman Brewing Company, Inc. The primary brands were Wiedemann Fine Beer, Royal Amber Beer, Blatz Beer/Cream Ale and other assorted Heileman labels.

The name, the recipe, logo and all intellectual rights were bought out by beer brewer and journalist Jon Newberry. In 2018 Jon and wife, Betsy purchased an old funeral home in Cincinnati and after a few years of renovating the old building it opened up not only a brewery but a taproom and restaurant. In 2019 the Sipple Family, Covington natives, bought the home of George Wiedemann, Jr. at 401 Park Avenue. The historic home has been renovated and is now utilized as a place of business for the 2nd generation family business, Centennial Talent Strategy and Executive Search. Centennial, a family business like the Wiedemann Brewery Company, is one the Greater Cincinnati region's largest and most prominent firms in their industry. 401 Park Avenue is also the home of IMPACT Cowork, an executive coworking and meeting rental space, and Talent Magnet Institute, a consulting firm, with a weekly podcast recorded in the historic building.

His older brother, Greg McAdam, had earlier found his way to the St Kilda Football Club via North Adelaide in the SANFL. McAdam moved to Darwin to play in the Northern Territory Football League (NTFL) with the Southern Districts Football Club when he was just 11 years old. In 1979, Gilbert McAdam was chosen as the 12-year-old schoolboys Northern Territory captain who captained the team to victory to become the first Northern Territory team to win a national title. The stand out players were McAdams and Scott Parker who was the youngest competitor to have played in the carnival. In 1986, McAdam played 3 games for Claremont in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) before returning home to Darwin. After a few seasons he went on to play in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) with Central District Football Club, taking out the 1989 Magarey Medal. McAdam was the first indigenous player to take out the award. =AFL career= McAdam was drafted number 17 in the 1989 VFL Draft by St Kilda Football Club. After a few inconsistent years, he was traded to the Brisbane Bears. McAdam left the AFL in 1996 after several years of service to the Brisbane Bears (58 games) for a total of 111 AFL matches. He returned to the Central District Football Club for the 1998 SANFL season and retired from football altogether in 1999. His younger brother, Adrian, later found his way to a brief career with the North Melbourne Football Club. Gilbert was drafted by Collingwood but refused to return from retirement. Coaching career McAdam returned to Alice Springs and coached South Alice to a premiership. In 2006, he moved back to Darwin to coach the Darwin Football Club. Post- football career In 2007, McAdam took up a position with the Academy of Sport, Health and Education in Shepparton, Victoria. The academy uses participation in sport as an avenue for Indigenous people to undertake education and training within a trusted and culturally appropriate environment.

Also called a lightwell, it often provides access to the house for tradesmen and deliveries to vaults under the pavement; it stores coal areas. The term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the Georgian period in the UK, where it was normal for the service rooms, such as the kitchen, scullery and laundry, to be in the basement. Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings, which became one of the principal decorative features of the astylar terraced houses of this period. Areas are also found in the English and French country house, where basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting, as at Mereworth Castle in Kent or The Abbey, Skirwith in Cumberland. Basements, and consequently areas, decreased in popularity in the 19th century, as attitudes to servants changed, although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century. A suburban residential application can be seen at the Gamble House in Pasadena, California, to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement. In early 18th-century house descriptions, the area was usually called the \\"airy\\", which suggests that its primary function was ventilation, needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above.

The agreements and their formation shared a number of common characteristics. They were formulated outside the legal system, by ad-hoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose. Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company.  Compensation of fishermen  Ever since 1908 when Chisso opened the factory in Minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around Minamata, particularly into Minamata Bay via the waste canal outlet in Hyakken Harbour. Damage to fisheries was inevitable and the Minamata Fishing Cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of Minamata disease. After direct negotiations in 1926 the company agreed to pay \\"sympathy money\\" to the cooperative of JPY1,500 (USD704). By using the term the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including a clause in the agreement that the cooperative would \\"never again lodge complaints\\" against Chisso. This pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in Chisso's dealings with complainants. The pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in 1943. This time the cooperative was paid JPY152,500 in compensation for future and past damage to fishing. The cooperative was also forced to acknowledge Chisso's \\"importance to the prosperity of Minamata\\" and \\"the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations\\", indicating the unequal nature of the agreement. Fishing in Minamata Bay (W. E. Smith) =The Minamata Fishing Cooperative= By the time of the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical. From 1953 to 1957 the fish catch in Minamata had declined by a staggering 91%.George, p. 72 - Table 3 In 1956, the Kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the sale of fish caught from Minamata Bay, but did not issue and all-out ban. This left fishermen with fish they could not sell, but no financial assistance to compensate their losses. In September 1958 the Minamata Fishing Cooperative petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the Fisheries Law and Food Sanitation Act. The government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay. However, with no source of income, many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught. In fact, throughout the history of the Minamata disease problem, the catching of fish from Minamata Bay has never been legally prohibited.George, p. 53 Despite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish, there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the Minamata area was unsafe and by June 1959 several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand. Desperate, and with no assistance from government, the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company. On 6 August 400 members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in a hostile atmosphere met with factory manager Eiichi Nishida. The fishermen's demand for the cleanup of Minamata Bay, the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and JPY100 million (USD278,000) was met with an offer of \\"emergency sympathy money\\" to the value of JPY500,000 (USD1,390) and a promise to consult with the company's head office in Tokyo. Fishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on 12 August to continue negotiations. No agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to a joint inspection of fishing conditions in Minamata Bay, followed by further talks on 17 August. After this inspection Chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made a final offer of JPY13 million (USD36,100). This paltry sum incensed the fishermen. Violence broke out, riot police were called and Nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building. Only after Mayor Todomu Nakamura agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds. The mediation committee formed by Mayor Nakamura was stacked heavily in Chisso's favour and presented a decision on 26 August. The company would pay JPY20 million (USD55,600) directly to the cooperative and set up a JPY15 million (USD41,700) fund to promote the recovery of fishing. The proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected, the committee would stop mediation completely. On 29 August the fishing cooperative delivered its response: \\"In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept\\". The company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between Chisso and fisherman was complete.George, pp. 76–81 =The Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives= To the company's disappointment, this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen. Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the Shiranui Sea. Cats had started to die in Ashikita to the north and in Izumi to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing. The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people's confidence in the safety of their food evaporated. This drove the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year, but on a larger scale. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso. When company officials refused, the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office, breaking windows and injuring seven guards. Alliance president Ushita Murakami delivered their demands to company manager Nishida, who promised a prompt reply. When the response came, the company said that since the factory's waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease, and it could offer the fishermen nothing. Unsatisfied, Murakami and followers travelled to Tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight. He managed to secure a promise from members of the Diet that they would visit Minamata to investigate the situation. When the Diet party arrived in Minamata on 2 November they were met by a crowd of 4,000 demonstrators (including fishermen and disease victims groups alike) outside the Municipal Hospital. The crowd was extremely respectful to the Diet members and pleaded with them for help. The members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could. Emboldened after their demonstration at the hospital, the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations. The company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted, attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property. Riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around 9 pm. Injuries included 30-40 fishermen, two company employees, factory manager Nishida himself, 64 policemen and the chief of police. Damages to company property amounted to JPY10 million (USD27,800).George, pp. 81–101 Before the riot the Minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly a local issue. The violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in 1956 the issue of Minamata disease had nationwide coverage.Ui, Chapter 4 - section V A mediation committee headed by Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Hirosaku Teramoto was formed to hammer out a solution. At a meeting on 2 December the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands: compensation of JPY2.5 billion (USD6.9 million) for damage to fishing since 1953, the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge. The committee then met company executives, including Chisso president Kiichi Yoshioka, who responded with an offer that amounted to \\"nearly zero\\". After weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to JPY980 million (USD2.7 million) and Chisso, under increasing pressure from all sides, relaxed its position. The proposed agreement (presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected, as previously) called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities, JPY35 million compensation to be paid to the alliance (JPY10 million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the 2 November riots) and a JPY65 million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry. The agreement also included a clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation, even if the factory's waste was proven to be the cause of the damage. The agreement was accepted by both sides on 17 December.  Compensation of victims  In 1959, the victims of Minamata disease and their families were in a much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some \\"sympathy money\\" from Chisso. The only patients' organisation present at the time of the fishermen's agreements was the Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society, which had only been established in August 1957. They were much fewer in number (in November 1959 the society only represented the 58 families of 78 patients) and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen. One factor driving the division of the patients was the discrimination and ostracism some families were experiencing in the Minamata community. Local people, who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease, felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it. Even fishermen, who were fellow victims of the company's pollution, discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish. To some patients this ostracism from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. In a similar fashion to the fishermen's associations, the Mutual Aid Society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited Kumamoto city on 21 November. When their petitions produced no results, the society approached Chisso directly and demanded compensation of JPY234 million (USD650,000) – JPY3 million (USD8,300) per person. On 28 November the company replied that the link between the factory's wastewater and Minamata disease had not been proven and could, therefore, offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy. The society began a sit-in at the company gates, which was to last a whole month. Around 50 members of the society travelled to Kumamoto on 1 December and made a request to Governor Teramoto to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. He agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on 16 December, it also presented a proposal for \\"sympathy\\" payments to the Mutual Aid Society, even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee. The proposal amounted to a total compensation package of JPY74 million. The money would be allocated to patients certified by a committee to be established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as follows: adult patients would receive JPY100,000 (USD278) and children JPY10,000 (USD28) per year; families of dead patients would receive a JPY320,000 (USD889) payment. Society leader Eizō Watanabe agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims. The mediation committee reconvened on 25 December and agreed to increase the child payments to JPY30,000 (USD83) per child. The Mutual Aid Society held a vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by a single vote. Society leader Watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on 27 December members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn. As usual, the agreement did not admit responsibility for Minamata disease. The payments were \\"sympathy money\\" and the agreement included a clause that, \\"Even if in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is the factory's wastewater, [the patients] will make absolutely no further demands for compensation\\", along with an extra clause that, \\"If in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is not the factory's wastewater, the company shall end payments at the end of that month.\\" The final agreement was accepted by both sides on 29 December 1959.George, pp. 102–113 Notes References *George, Timothy S.

Water enters at right, fills the trap, and continues left. Inverted siphoning occurs below the line \\"A\\". Examples of traps In plumbing, a trap is a U-shaped portion of pipe designed to trap liquid or gas to prevent unwanted flow; most notably sewer gases from entering buildings while allowing waste materials to pass through. In oil refineries, traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases and chemical fumes from escaping through drains. In heating systems, the same feature is used to prevent thermo-siphoning which would allow heat to escape to locations where it is not wanted. Similarly, some pressure gauges are connected to systems using U bends to maintain a local gas while the system uses liquid. For decorative effect, they can be disguised as complete loops of pipe, creating more than one U for added efficacy. In domestic applications, traps are typically U, S, Q, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture. An S-shaped trap is also known as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. In the United States, traps are commonly referred to as P-traps. It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the outlet side of a U-bend, thereby creating a P-like shape (oriented horizontally). It is also referred to as a sink trap because it is installed under most sinks. Because of its shape, the trap retains some water after the fixture's use. This water creates an air seal that prevents sewer gas from passing from the drain pipes back into the building. Essentially all plumbing fixtures including sinks, bathtubs, and showers must be equipped with either an internal or external trap. Toilets almost always have an internal trap. Because it is a localized low-point in the plumbing, sink traps also tend to capture small and heavy objects (such as jewellery or coins) accidentally dropped down the sink. Traps also tend to collect hair, sand, food waste and other debris and limit the size of objects that enter the plumbing system, thereby catching oversized objects. For all of these reasons, most traps may be disassembled for cleaning or provide a cleanout feature. Where a volume of water may be rapidly discharged through the trap, a vertical vented pipe called a standpipe may be attached to the trap to prevent the disruption of the seal in other nearby traps. The most common use of standpipes in houses is for clothes washing machines, which rapidly dispense a large volume of wastewater while draining the wash and rinse cycles. History An S-shaped trap is also known as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. Once invented, despite being simple and reasonably reliable, widespread use was slow coming. In Britain, the requirement to use traps was introduced only after the Great Stink in London, in the summer of 1858, when the objectionable smell of the River Thames, which was effectively an open sewer, affected the nearby Houses of Parliament. That motivated the legislators to authorise the construction of a modern sewerage system in the city, of which the S-bend was an essential component. , only about two-thirds of the world population have access to traps, in spite of the evidence that good sewage systems significantly improve economic productivity in places that employ them. Venting and auxiliary devices Trap with copper drain pipe at underside of firestop packing in 2 hour fire-resistance rated concrete floor slab Typical P-trap Maintaining the water seal is critical to trap operation; traps might dry out, and poor venting can suction or blow water out of the traps. This is usually avoided by venting the drain pipes downstream of the trap; by being vented to the atmosphere outside the building, the drain lines never operate at a pressure much higher or lower than atmospheric pressure. In the United States, Plumbing codes usually provide strict limitations on how far a trap may be located from the nearest vent stack. When a vent cannot be provided, an air admittance valve may be used instead. These devices avoid negative pressure in the drain pipe by venting room air into the drain pipe (behind the trap). A \\"Chicago Loop\\" is another alternative. When a trap is installed on a fixture that is not routinely used—such as a floor drain—the eventual evaporation of the water in the trap must be considered. In these cases, a trap primer may be installed; these are devices that automatically recharge traps with water to maintain their water seals. Accepted traps in the United States In some regions of the US, \\"S\\" traps are no longer accepted by the plumbing codes as these traps tend to siphon dry even when well vented. It may be possible to determine whether a household uses an S- or U-bend by the presence of an overflow pipe outlet. What is required instead is a P-trap with proper venting. Certain drum-styled traps are also discouraged or banned. Includes several photographs of various types of drum traps.

Bos continued to look after the production of the atlas until his death in 1902: his final production was the 15th edition. The last of his successors to take individual responsibility for the Atlas was F.J.Ormeling (1976–1981). Since 1981 responsibility for the atlas has been collectively attributed and it is the publisher's name that has been highlighted in the atlas and associated marketing material. The reason for first publication was the introduction of geography in (former) Dutch high schools. The maps were originally drawn by hand.

The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior – how an individual's thoughts get transformed into action. It was developed by John Greene.Em Griffen. A First Look at Communication Theory. \\"Chapter 11: Action Assembly Theory of John Greene.\\" McGraw-Hill.  Definition  Action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: * the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and * the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. Action assembly theory seeks to explain message behavior (both verbal and nonverbal). It is a communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action. The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior-how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action. According to the psychology wiki, action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. For example, assembly is considered a top-to-bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to a more specific idea about communicating the specific message.  Retrieval of procedural elements  The idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly. These records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations. These records are locked in the individual's memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future. A procedural record is at the center of action assembly. It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use, part of an individual's memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored. Procedural records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations; for example, traveling at excessive speed (action) in a zone that specifies low speed limit (situation) can result in the issuance of a ticket (outcome). Procedural records have different levels of strength. Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind, while others are well-worn into long- term memory. A central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations. The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records. For example, if a parent disciplined a child for stealing, all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated. In turn, if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items, a procedural record of that would be activated quickly.  Organization of procedural elements  It is also important to consider the process of assembly, which organizes records into a behavioral representation. For example, assembly is considered a top-down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message. Action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking. These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing. Another use is the study of planning – individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not, because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production. When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual's information processing capacity. Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goal may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals. In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies. The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to mitigate the effect.

Each episode was an eclectic, freeform mix of blues, folk, rockabilly, R&B;, soul, bebop, rock-and-roll, country and pop music, centered on a theme such as \\"Weather,\\" \\"Money\\" or \\"Flowers\\" with songs from artists as diverse as Patti Page and LL Cool J. Much of the material for the show's 100 episodes was culled from producer Eddie Gorodetsky's music collection, which reportedly includes more than 10,000 records and more than 140,000 digital files. Interspersed between the music segments were email readings, listener phone calls, vintage radio air checks, old radio promos and jingles, even older jokes from Dylan (\\"My grandmother is so tidy she puts newspaper under the cuckoo clock\\"), poetry recitations; taped messages from a variety of celebrities, musicians and comedians; and commentary from Dylan on the music and musicians as well as miscellanea related to the themes. The show was not live (Dylan taped his portions at various locations and while touring), and the studio location at the so-called \\"Abernathy Building\\" was fictitious. Most of the \\"listener phone calls\\" and emails were also fictitious, although at least one email read on the show came from an actual listener. Original broadcast history The first episode of TTRH was broadcast on May 3, 2006 on the Deep Tracks channel of XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service, now called Sirius XM Radio after its purchase and merger with competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. TTRH was originally broadcast every Wednesday at 10:00 am ET on Deep Tracks, with several \\"encore\\" repeats throughout the week on various channels, including an all-day airing on what was XMX Channel 2. On November 12, 2008, Sirius XM revised its channel lineup, providing Sirius and XM listeners with access to programming on both networks. As of that date, TTRH began airing every Wednesday at 11 am ET on Deep Tracks – Channel 40 on XM and Channel 16 on Sirius. Several channels on both stations were discontinued in November 2008, including XMX Channel 2, which had aired TTRH all day on Wednesdays. The show was simulcast on DirecTV until February 9, 2010. From 2006 through 2008 AOL Radio offered the show on \\"AOL Radio featuring XM,\\" a selection of 200 XM radio stations that was available to those with an AOL login and a broadband internet connection. In March 2008, XM Radio and America Online announced that they were ending that relationship \\"by mutual agreement\\" and at the end of April, 2008 the XM Radio channels were no longer available on AOL Radio. From 2007–9 the program aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music, and in Ireland on Dublin-based alternative rock station Phantom FM. Season 3 of TTRH concluded with the show's 100th original episode on April 15, 2009. The theme of that show was \\"Goodbye.\\" During an April 2009 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Dylan implied that his contract with Sirius XM had ended, and that he had no plans to do additional episodes of TTRH. In September 2020, SiriusXM announced that a 101st episode of the Theme Time Radio Hour would be produced and aired as part of a marathon rerunning of the whole series. The new episode, with a whiskey theme, is being produced as a tie-in to Dylan's Heaven's Door Spirits.Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour to return with new episode for first time since 2009, RadioInsight.com, September 16, 2020 Reruns Sirius XM continued to air rebroadcasts of Theme Time Radio Hour on the Deep Tracks channel to the end of April 2011. At the beginning of May 2011, TTRH was replaced with the \\"Earle Bailey\\" show. On July 25, 2011, Sirius XM issued a press releasehttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bob-dylans-theme-time- radio-hour-channel-to-launch-on-siriusxm-126111948.html announcing the launch of a 24/7 \\"Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour\\" internet-only channel. The press release noted that channel would launch on Monday, August 15 on channel 801 on Sirius XM Internet Radio and would feature \\"every one of Dylan's classic 'Theme Time Radio Hour' shows.\\" The release also noted \\"Sirius XM listeners will hear a show from the Theme Time Radio Hour vault on Deep Tracks, channel 27, on Mondays at 8:00 pm; Wednesdays at 11:00 am; Thursdays at 12:00 am and Sundays at 8:00 am (all times Eastern),\\" marking the show's return to satellite radio, if only in rebroadcasts. The internet channel and radio rebroadcasts were discontinued in August 2013. Seasons and episode lists Season 1 of TTRH consists of fifty episodes, airing from May 3, 2006 to April 18, 2007. Season 2 of TTRH ran from September 19, 2007 to April 2, 2008 for a total 25 new shows. Three Season 2 shows, \\"Halloween,\\" \\"Leftovers\\" (Thanksgiving) and the \\"Christmas/New Year's Special\\" were repeats from Season 1. Season 3 of TTRH ran from Wednesday, October 8, 2008, to Wednesday, April 15, 2009 for a total 25 new shows. Three Season 3 episodes, \\"President's Day,\\" \\"Christmas/New Year's Special,\\" and \\"Number One\\" were repeats from earlier seasons. One-offs: The \\"Kiss\\" episode In early February 2015, Berlin radio station Radio Eins made a surprise announcement http://www.radioeins.de/themen/musik/freundliche-uebernahme/musiker/bob-dylan ---theme-time-radio-hour-kiss-show.html that it would broadcast a heretofore unknown episode of Theme Time Radio Hour, titled \\"Kiss,\\" as a special episode of the station's Friendly Takeover series. The Radio Eins \\"Kiss\\" episode was broadcast on February 11, 2015 and later by SiriusXM and the BBC. Due to time constraints, both the Radio Eins and BBC versions of the \\"Kiss\\" episode were edited by the respective stations, and neither broadcast the complete hour- long show.http://www.expectingrain.com/discussions/viewtopic.php?f=11&t;=83121 Show track listings:http://www.themetimeradio.com/episode-101-kiss/ # \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\" - Betty Everett (1964) # \\"Always Late with Your Kisses\\" - Lefty Frizzell (1951) # \\"Passionate Kisses\\" - Lucinda Williams (1988) # \\"Kissing At Midnight\\" - Billy Boy Arnold (1957) # \\"Kiss\\" - Prince (1986) # \\"Kissing in the Dark\\" - Memphis Minnie (1953) # \\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\\" - Danny White (1963) # \\"Pucker Paint\\" - Huelyn Duvall (1960) # \\"Lipstick on Your Collar\\" - Connie Francis (1959) # \\"(Till) I Kissed You\\" - The Everly Brothers (1959) # \\"Let’s Kiss and Make Up\\" - The Falcons (1963) # \\"Baby, Let Me Kiss You One More Time\\" - Roy Head and The Traits (1958) # \\"Last Kiss\\" - J.

It was set down plainly in the Law of the Twelve Tables as follows: > The Law of the Twelve Tables orders that he who has stirred up an enemy or > who has handed over a citizen to the enemy is to be punished capitally. > (Marcianus, D. 48, 4, 3) . Under the terms of this law, those convicted of perduellio were subject to death either by being hanged from the arbor infelix (a tree deemed to be unfortunate) or by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. Their families were not allowed to mourn them and their houses were razed.  History  As the concept of national sovereignty took hold in Rome, perduellio also came to mean an offense which “injured or brought into danger the dignity, supremacy, and power of the commonwealth [Roman State]”. This included such things as losing an army, violating the rights of the tribunes of the plebs, or usurping a function of the State (as in the case of Horatius). In the Ab Urbe Condita, Livy recorded the first instance of both a trial of perduellio and appeal: > It enraged the fiery youth to hear his sister’s lamentations in the hour of > his own victory and the nation’s great rejoicing. And so, drawing his sword > and at the same time angrily upbraiding her, he ran her through the body…The > king…said: “In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgment > upon Horatius for treason [perduellio]. The dread formula or the law ran > thus: ‘Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason; if he shall appeal > from the duumvirs, let the appeal be tried; if the duumvirs win, let the > lictor veil his head, let [the lictor] suspend him with a rope from a barren > tree [arbor infelix]; let [the lictor] scourge him either within or without > the pomerium.’ Even though the duumvirs found Horatius guilty, Horatius was > allowed to appeal (to the people) and by them was acquitted. However, > Horatius’ father had to perform expiatory rites and Horatius himself was > forced to pass under the yoke. But over time with the expansion of the rights of Roman citizens, the use of corporal punishment lessened until the time of Augustus when conviction only carried with it the punishment of aquae et ignis interdictio (exile). The trial was conducted by the duumviri perduellionis, who during the Monarchy were appointed by the king. Later on during the Republic they were proposed by the consuls and formally appointed by the comitia (comitia curiata or comitia centuriata). The judgement of the duumviri was subject to appeal, which generally was tried by the comitia centuriata unlike in Horatius' trial. The prosecution was led by tribunes or aediles. By the late Republic, the archaic perduellio had become largely obsolete, though it could still be used (see Gaius Rabirius). Its offenses were covered by the law of maiestas which included a broader range of crimes. Perduellio became the designation for a particularly odious type of maiestas.

The repertoire spans from the renaissance to music by contemporary composers. The choir has been awarded the Norwegian Spellemannprisen prize (the Norwegian equivalent to a Grammy Award) for three of its thirteen albums (in 1977, 1983, and 2006) and has won first prizes in national and international contests (Arezzo, Gorizia, Tolosa and the International Chamber Choir Competition Marktoberdorf). In 1999 Grex Vocalis was awarded Il Gran Premio Città di Arezzo as the overall best choir in that year's contest. Grex Vocalis is primarily an a cappella choir, comprising ca. 35 singers, but performs on occasion also with soloists and orchestras. They have toured extensively in Europe, and also given a series of concerts in Japan and Cuba. History Over the years Grex Vocalis has commissioned and premiered works by several Norwegian composers, including Knut Nystedt, Trond Kverno and Arne Nordheim. In 1994 the choir took part in the stage production of Arne Nordheim's monumental Draumkvedet, which with the Norwegian Broadcasting Radio Orchestra and soloists was performed 40 times. They have also performed important baroque works like Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610, Handel's Messiah, Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Rameau's In convertendo and Quam dilecta, Charpentier's Te Deum, Lully's Te Deum, Delalande's Te Deum, etc., with orchestras and soloists. Collaboration projects with Oslo Cathedral Choir and the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra have led to performances of larger works like Brahms's Requiem, Penderecki's St. Luke Passion and Verdi's Quattro Pezzi Sacri. The first Norwegian recording of Handel's Messiah was released in 1997 with Grex Vocalis and Oslo Baroque Orchestra. The choir's latest CDs, including \\"Magnum Mysterium\\" with Christmas music from several eras, \\"Crux\\" with Norwegian music from the 20th century, and \\"Liberté\\" with works by Francis Poulenc, have been particularly highly praised in the media, both at home and abroad. Grex Vocalis is frequently heard on Norwegian radio and has also appeared in various television programmes. In the acclaimed Gymnaslærer Pedersens beretning om den store politiske vekkelse som har hjemsøkt vårt land 2006 film based on Dag Solstad's acclaimed Gymnaslærer Pedersens beretning om den store politiske vekkelse som har hjemsøkt vårt land 1982 novel, songs from the acclaimed Frihetens faner på ny CD were used. The conductor Carl Høgset holds degrees in languages and musicology from the University of Oslo as well as in voice and choral conducting from the Norwegian State Academy of Music. In 1977 he made his debut as a countertenor in a solo recital in Oslo. His solo-CD recording with songs by Purcell, Handel, Grieg and Nordheim was released in 1995. He is a member of the vocal quartet Quattro Stagioni. In December 2007 he was awarded the Ridder av 1. klasse av Den Kongelige St. Olavs Orden for his wide-ranging contributions for Norwegian choral music, in Norway as well as internationally.

The station was on the former line between and , which closed in 1930. On 4 October 1976 a new unstaffed passenger station was opened by British Rail to serve the nearby Rolls-Royce factory. Despite Derby City Council's efforts to encourage usage of public transport, based on the Cross-City Line in Birmingham, the service was very underused. The service was reduced to one return train per day in 1992 with the return departing Sinfin Central at 06:57. The service did not run at weekends, and there was no evening return. This ran until 1993, when the Derwent Valley Line, which interworked with the Sinfin branch, changed to using Sprinter trains. Sprinters were not permitted on the branch because of compatibility issues with the obsolete low-voltage track circuits used on the line. The last train ran on 17 May 1993, and the train service was replaced with a taxi. On 2 May 1997, the line became part of the Central Trains franchise as part of the privatisation of British Rail, but none of their trains ever stopped at the station. On 6 November 1997, Central Trains and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising proposed the closure of the line. It was granted on 21 May 1998 by Rail Regulator John Swift QC. During the final year, there were three regular users of the taxi at a single fare of £1.20. Unlike Sinfin North, Sinfin Central had public access with a long footpath from Wilmore Road. There was no public road access to the station or car park, and the path is still in situ. The line survives to serve the Rolls-Royce plant, and the station is still in situ.

At the , Quindanning had a population of 163. The town is named after Quindanning Pool, located along the Williams River. The name is of Aboriginal origin, and was first recorded in 1835 when it was discovered by Alfred Hillman. Low-level agricultural settlement occurred in the 1830s. By 1900, a school and racecourse had been built and in 1907 a townsite was surveyed and gazetted around it. Quindanning was one of the centres ministered to by the Brotherhood of St. Boniface, which was stationed in Williams from 1911 to 1929. To honour their work, the Quindanning Anglican church was named after their patron when it was consecrated in 1956. The church is constructed of stone carted from local properties by members of the church; the estimated cost of the building at the time of its construction was 4,600 pounds. The Quindanning Hotel had origins in a mud-brick building, with a Wayside Licence issued on 3 December 1900. The building was substantially renovated in 1921 to become a well-known \\"inland resort hotel\\" between 1925 and the late 1950s. During the 1930s the hotel had a 9-hole golf course, horse riding, game hunting and swimming at Quindanning Pool.

History  The Australian Ranger Association (ARA) was formed in Adelaide, South Australia in 1996 to provide representation and a national approach to the Rangers profession within Australia. The ARA focused on setting industry national standards for protected areas; professional networks; sharing of training, endorsement of specific standout providers; social networks for moral boosting and renewed energy. Individual state/territory ranger bodies generally started as industrial organisations but slowly over time and through engagement at a national level morphed to more professional level. The growing representation in each state/territory of separate industrial organisations allowed the ARA to develop representation on professional issues. The ARA was renamed into the Australian Ranger Federation in 2004. This change was made to better reflect the professional focus of the organisation and more closely affiliate with the International Ranger Federation (IRF). The description of Federation in the title was also considered to better represent the ideals of members. The Australian Rangers Federation developed a network and provided a forum for rangers to communication on professional issues. Each state and territory progressively established its own association, and directly affiliated with the IRF. The operations of the Australian Rangers Federation become duplicated and obsolete. The ARF was further renamed into the Council of Australian Ranger Associations (CARA) at the Queensland Rangers Association AGM in 2008, re-establish itself the principle professional body representing people that work in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage on conserved lands. Many of the state and territory association retain close links with industrial organisations, government conservation agencies, and NGO’s.  Purpose  The Australian Ranger Association (ARA) was established to provide representation and a national approach to the Rangers profession within Australia. The association was successful in establishing a national network that enabled Rangers to communicate directly and discuss industrial and professional workplace issues. The Australian Rangers Federation (ARF) was a professional body supporting Rangers and other professional officers involved in the conservation and management of our natural and cultural resources. The ARF represents its members at an international level through the International Ranger Federation (IRF). Membership to the ARF provided automatic membership to the IRF, and provision to attend the IRF world congresses. The ARF represented Australian Rangers through providing forums that enable international communication and rangers to discuss topics of interest and exchange ideas. The Council of Australian Ranger Associations (CARA) comprises representation from each state and territory associations in Australia which are themselves directly affiliated with the IRF. CARA is a professional body that represents and supports Rangers and other professional officers involved in the conservation and management of our natural and cultural resources. CARA represents not just only rangers, but all people that work within and supportive roles of staff of government and private conservation organisations. Operations Membership to the individual state or territory association automatically entitles members to CARA and the IRF. Members of each state territory association have the opportunity to attend the IRF World congress, CARA annual general meetings, and input to the operations of CARA and the IRF. Each state/territory association undertake the facilitation of CARA on an annual rotation basis. Representatives from each member state/territory association meet annual to discuss the operations of CARA and to maintain communication between each association CARA is working with NGO’s and state conservation agencies to improve the profession within Australia.

Overview Thomas Hinde is the patriarch of the Hinde family in the United States. His youngest son, Thomas S. Hinde, was a notable Methodist minister and businessman, Charles T. Hinde, his grandson, was a shipping magnate, and Edmund C. Hinde, another grandson, was an adventurer. The Kavanaugh and Southgate branches of his family held elected office and positions of leadership in the Methodist church. As personal physician to Patrick Henry, Hinde played a critical role in the American Revolutionary War through his vaccinations against smallpox and treatment of wounded soldiers. For his service he received a large land grant in Kentucky, where he moved with his family. Hinde was northern Kentucky's first physician, and a memorial was erected in Campbell County, Kentucky to honor his services to the state. He died in 1828 aged 91, which was unusually old for the time. According to Otto Juettner in 1909, who was a famous medical doctor and medical historian, Hinde \\"never wrote a line in his life.\\" His life has been described as being like a \\"romance\\", and he was called a \\"patriarch\\" to the American medical profession. Early life Hinde was born in Oxfordshire, England, in July 1737. He received a classical education in Oxfordshire and, after completing his studies, was sent to London, England to study medicine. He studied physics and surgery under Dr Thomas Brooke at Saint Thomas Hospital in London and, at the age of nineteen, was presented to the Company of Surgeons for a licence. Shortly after, he was commissioned as a Surgeons' Mate in the Royal Navy and sailed for America with the forces commanded by General Amherst. After landing in New York on June 10, 1757, he spent time at Halifax and Louisbourg. Hinde spent the winter of 1758 in Halifax and assisted Amherst with the reduction of Louisburg. He was attached to the ship which bore the commander in chief, General James Wolfe, on his way to Quebec. Death of General Wolfe The Death of General Wolfe by Benjamin West Wolfe died in Hinde's arms during the 1759 Battle of Quebec of the Seven Years' War. According to one source, Hinde's relationship with General Wolfe and his experiences in Quebec were some of the most \\"cherished\\" experiences of his life. A painting of the death shows Dr Hinde compressing a wound to General Wolfe's torso. It is an oil on canvas of the Enlightenment period. Benjamin West, who painted it, made a nearly identical painting of the same scene for King George III in 1771.Montagna, 80. After Wolfe's death, Hinde remained in the British Navy and was present for the reduction of Bell'isle. Shortly after, Hinde was promoted and remained as a physician for a warship after the peace of 1763. He eventually resigned his commission. Copies of The Death of General Wolfe by West are currently in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, the Royal Ontario Museum (Canadiana art collection), the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan and at Ickworth House, Suffolk, England. After Quebec After the fall of Quebec, Hinde returned briefly to England. Peace with France was reached in 1763, and Hinde then returned to Virginia and settled. He formed a close friendship with an unnamed Virginian who persuaded him to settle in a place called Hobbs Hole in Essex County, Virginia and practice medicine. Another source states that an aged physician in Virginia wrote to Dr Thomas Brooke, Hinde's mentor, asking Brooke to send a young physician to assist him in his practice. Brooke reportedly choose Hinde and \\"earnestly advised\\" him to \\"avail himself of the situation which was offered\\". Hinde accepted, but moved soon after to settle in Newton, now in West Virginia, where he met his wife. After their wedding Hinde moved again and settled in Hanover County, Virginia. Physician to Patrick Henry Patrick Henry In 1765, after he settled in Virginia, Hinde became acquainted with Patrick Henry one of the founding fathers of the United States, Samuel Davis, and Lord Dunmore. Two years later he married Mary T. Hubbard, settled near Henry, and became his family physician. His association with Henry and settlement in Virginia helped Hinde become acquainted with many of the leading members of society during the period. When Hinde first met Hubbard, he found her to \\"possess a great flow of animal spirits, full of humor, gay and lively inner temperament and disposition, with strong powers of mind, and at the same time active and sociable\\". The couple married on September 24, 1767. According to a biography written by George Coles in 1857, Henry's statesmanlike eloquence and political principles made a strong impression on Hinde and shifted him from being a staunch royalist to a \\"sturdy republican\\". Hinde took an active part in the American Revolutionary War serving as a surgeon with Patrick and in various campaigns and battles. At the time of the 1775 Gunpowder Incident, Hinde was Chief Surgeon for Patrick Henry. His involvement in it was the turning point that led him to embrace the cause of the oppressed colonies against Lord Dunmore and the English royalty. The Gunpowder Incident was a conflict early in the American Revolutionary War, between Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and militia led by Henry. Hinde originally planned to take a front-line post in Henry's regiment, but when Henry was elected Governor, Hinde was instead appointed to inoculate all members of the continental service. Because of insufficient funds in the continental army, Hinde was forced to cover the costs of inoculations, which \\"seriously impaired his private fortune\\". One source states that Hinde amputated limbs during the war by the \\"cart-load\\". After the war, Hinde continued to live in Hanover County for many years, primarily practicing medicine. Military land grant After the American Revolutionary War, Hinde moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, having received a large land grant for his services in the war. One source describes the land grant as follows: > At the close of the war, having drawn no part of his salary, and from his > great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians, in > settling up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant, to be located > in lands selected in Kentucky, leaving a blank within the warrant for the > number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself. The blank was filled with > twenty thousand, and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and > locate the lands. For undisclosed reasons, Henry was unable to complete the land grant to Hinde due to surveying difficulties, who then used his nephew Hubbard Taylor to go to Kentucky, find the location, and complete the transaction. Hinde gave Taylor half of the lands for this service. The land was in Clark County, Kentucky, between Winchester and Lexington. Conversion to Methodism During his early years in England, Hinde was a member of the Church of England, but he abandoned the church as an adult and had become a Deist. One biographer stated that for a time Hinde \\"took pride and pleasure in ridiculing Christianity\\". In later years, however, his religious views \\"underwent a radical change\\". In 1798, Methodist ministers arrived in Hinde's neighborhood and began to convert people. Susanna, one of Hinde's daughters, converted, causing distress to the family. Hinde banished her from his home, and she went to live with her aunt forty miles away. However, this failed because the aunt had already converted, and Hinde's wife converted soon after. Hinde became convinced that the disorder was in their heads, and treated them with medical procedures of the day, such as a \\"blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine, which he left on for several days\\". Drake states that, through this \\"measure of violence, he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship\\". The procedures were painful, but his wife stated afterwards that \\"it was a punishment, but I never was so happy in all my life\\". Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife, and he converted to Methodism. His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly. Two of his daughters married traveling preachers, and another daughter converted to Methodism too. By the end of his life, Hinde was a devout Methodist. According to one account: > At another time he was taking a morning walk and met Gen. James Taylor, a > relative by marriage, who said, 'Good-morning, doctor; where are you going?' > 'I am going to heaven; where are you going, general?' The general, at that > time, had some doubts about whether his road led to the same country, and > made no reply; but it is hoped he found the way to everlasting life before > he left the world.' One of Hinde's grandchildren states that Hinde built \\"little houses of sticks and wood\\" where he would pray. The grandchildren called them \\"Grandpa's prayer-houses\\". Hinde could be heard praying from a \\"considerable distance\\". Family Hinde married Mary Todd Hubbard, the daughter of Benjamin Hubbard, an English merchant, and they were married for 61 years. They had eight children that lived to adulthood. His daughter Ann Winston Hinde married Richard Southgate on July 30, 1799, in Newport, Kentucky. Hinde and his family were members of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Newport, Kentucky. One of Hinde's sons was Thomas S. Hinde, who was a cofounder of Mount Carmel, Illinois, and became a well-respected Methodist minister. Hinde's grandson Captain Charles T. Hinde was a successful businessman and riverboat captain. Charles was one of the principal investors in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California, and inspired Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, Dr Hinde's great- grandson, to build the Grand Rapids Hotel in Mount Carmel, Illinois. In his later life, Hinde lived with his daughter Mary McKinney of Newport, Kentucky.

Holland made his first-class and List A debuts for Victoria in October 2008, before playing his first Twenty20 match in January 2009. Although his figures from four Sheffield Shield matches, five one-day games and two Twenty20s were moderate, he showed enough potential to earn a place in the Australia A team that beat Pakistan A in Queensland in mid-2009. His solid performances in that series led to Holland being named in Australia's 30-man preliminary squad for the Champions Trophy. Though he didn't make the final cut then, his chance to represent the senior Australian team came soon after, when he was included in the 15-man squad for the seven-ODI tour to India. It was a major vote of confidence in Holland, who missed most of 2007–08 with a shoulder problem. A former Australia under-19s player who has also spent time at the Centre of Excellence, Holland is a naturally attacking spinner who has subtle changes of pace and can turn the ball sharply. A former sports science student, he was upgraded to a full Victoria contract for 2009–10 after three years on the rookie list.

From his background in jazz and traditional Scandinavian music, he has designed musical instruments from non-traditional materials, including ice.  Career  Isungset with Agbaland at Nattjazz, May 30, 2015 Isungset and Arve Henriksen performing glass music at Victoria, 2015 Isungset with glass drums at Victoria, December 2015 Isungset with glass instruments at Victoria, December 2015 Isungset was raised in Geilo where he played traditional dance music with his father (accordion) during his high school days. Moving to Bergen in 1984 led him to be a popular member of a number of Bergen groups, such as Ictus and Tordenskjolds soldater (1984–85), Growl and Gruv (1984-88), Saksbehandlerne and Night and Day (1985–86), Salsa Pati (1985–87), and Supply (1985–88), in addition to periods within the Big Band Emanon from 1986, and his recording debut Amalgamation (1985) with Kenneth Sivertsen. Isungset is, after more than two decades on the jazz scene, one of Europe's most accomplished and innovative percussionists. With more than 25 years experience in jazz and Scandinavian traditional music he raises these narrow forms of music far beyond their traditional boundaries, becoming more like a crossover between a sound artist and a shaman. When crafting his own instruments from Norwegian natural elements such as arctic birch, granite, slate, sheep bells and even ice, he is highly recommended to those sensible to the poetry and simplicity of sounds. His work is highly acclaimed in the press, often described as innovative, visual, energetic, and different from any previously known concepts. His love for ice music was raised in 1999 when the commission of the winterfestival at Lillehammer asked him to compose and play in a frozen waterfall. He has invented the concept of icemusic, and also invented a way to perform icemusic indoor in ordinary concert halls, doing around 50 indoor ice concerts every year. CNN calls Isungset the first and only icemusician in the world. Isungset has been commissioned to compose music for jazz festivals, dance performances, theatre, and film, with 41 commissioned concerts. He has released ten solo albums and is now doing most of his work internationally. Solo concerts, with his band or in collaboration with other artists. In 2006 he had the idea of creating an icemusic festival and started the Ice Music Festival at Geilo, Norway organized by Pål Knutsson Medhus. He is also the founding manager of the record label All Ice Records. His most recent project is the Glassmusic together with Arve Henriksen. They released an album named World of Glass in late 2014. The recordings were largely made in front of a live audience in Tallinn. All the instruments were made from glass by students from the Estonian Academy of Arts. He is a member of the bandsGroupa (Sweden), Utla and Isglem. He has ongoing duos with Per Jørgensen, Arve Henriksen, Sissel Vera Pettersen, Didier Petit, Therese Skauge, Jorma Tapio and Stian Westerhus. For the 2017 Vossajazz festival, Isungset was commissioned to compose new music for a new band. Isungset is also an associate professor at the Grieg Academy, University of Bergen.

The La Salle-class transport had a displacement of almost 14,000 tons and were designed to ferry troops and supplies to and from the war zone during World War II. War Hawk carried eight LCVP (Higgins Boat) type landing craft used to move troops and four LCMs used to move heavy equipment to and from the shore. Service history Her keel was laid down on 24 December 1942. The hull was completed in a little over three months and was launched on 3 April 1943 under the command of Commander S. H. Thompson. After launch, War Hawk was fitted out and acquired by the United States Navy on 9 March 1944. She was commissioned on the same day and designated AP-168. =The Marianas missions= On 21 April 1944 she left the San Francisco Bay headed for Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu. At Pearl Harbor War Hawk joined the 5th Fleet Amphibious Force and after training, left for her part in \\"Operation Forager\\", the liberation of the Marianas Islands. At the time of the landing there were about 59,000 Japanese troops stations in the Southern Marianas Islands, in particular on Saipan, Tinian and Guam. The assault on Marianas was conducted with overwhelming force. All total there were 198 vessels involved including 110 transports and auxiliary ships and 88 warships. These ships carried and supported a force of 110,000 men. However, Saipan had been in Japanese control for more than ten years and was heavily fortified. There were approximately 31,000 Japanese troops (including navy), and well entrenched on the island. War Hawk arrived at Saipan on 15 June 1944 and landed elements of the 2nd Marine Division on the southwestern shore of the island. Sometime during the next eight days War Hawk helped fight off two Japanese air attacks. During this time she also took on eleven seriously wounded Japanese prisoners of war. As was the nature of many Japanese soldiers, the only way they would be taken prisoner was if they could not fight. The extent of their wounds was so great that all eleven died in spite of efforts of War Hawks medical staff. They were buried at sea. Four days after the landing, the Allies engaged the Japanese Navy in the Philippine Sea and inflicted tremendous damage. This battle prevented the Imperial Japanese Navy from resupplying their troops in the Marianas leaving a brutal war of attrition for the Japanese until the commanding officer, General Yoshitsugu Saitō, committed suicide and the island was declared liberated on 9 July 1944. As the fighting on Saipan came to a close, some of War Hawks sister ships began moving troops from Saipan to Tinian. War Hawk did not directly participate in the invasion of Tinian. However, several LCVPs en route to Saipan's beachheads, came within range of what were apparently 20 mm explosive shell fire from Tinian which is only a few miles off the coast of Saipan. There were no hits, but much spray as the shells landed near the boats. On 23 June 1944 War Hawk headed back to Pearl Harbor where she picked up elements of the United States Army's 77th Infantry and returned to the Marianas. She landed her troops on Guam on 21 July. She loitered in the area for several more days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 June. There she spent a month practicing with new troops from the Army's 96th Infantry Division before leaving again for the South Pacific Theater. En route, she was diverted from the canceled invasion of Yap to take part in the invasion of the Philippines. =Leyte= During the latter part of 1944 and early 1945, War Hawk participated in the operations to liberate the Philippines. She left Pearl Harbor carrying elements of the Army's 96th Infantry Division and headed for Yap Island, in the Carolines. En route, she changed heading for Eniwetok as the invasion of Yap was canceled. After leaving Eniwetok, she sailed for Manus. She headed to the Philippines on 14 October 1944 to take part in the invasion of Leyte. Leyte was heavily defended by 20,000 Japanese troops. The Imperial Japanese Army had decided that it was best to fortify the Philippines to prevent the Allies from moving north through them to the Japanese homeland. In total there were about 432,000 troops on the various Philippine Islands. There were also between 100 and 120 operational Japanese air bases that would be used to provide air attacks during any amphibious invasion. The approach to the landing was from the southwest through the Leyte Gulf. The beaches were between the cities of Tacloban and Dulag on the northeast side of the island. In total, the Leyte invasion was the largest invasion mounted in the Pacific to date. There were a combined total of 701 ships of which 157 were warships. The transports put six Army divisions and one battalion of Rangers onto Leyte in just a few days. It was during this phase of the war that General Douglas MacArthur waded ashore at Red Beach and issued his famous \\"I have returned\\" speech to the people of the Philippines. Carl Mydans, a photographer for Time–Life, took the famous photograph of MacArthur wading ashore on Red Beach on 9 January 1945. War Hawk landed her troops not far away at Green Beach. In the evening of 21 October 1944, War Hawk was maneuvering through Leyte Gulf and rammed the battleship near the stern. Tennessee was laying dead in the water and generating smoke to protect the ships from air attack. No one was hurt on either ship. The damage to Tennessee was light but War Hawk sustained moderate damage near the bow. One of the more interesting pieces of cargo that War Hawk landed at Leyte was a Piper Cub artillery spotting aircraft. It left Pearl Harbor loaded onto the deck of War Hawk (with its wings removed) and was put ashore by an LCM. Before the aircraft could be assembled, a Japanese mortar round knocked a palm tree over onto it. After the initial invasion of Leyte, War Hawk sailed back to Dutch New Guinea, where she picked up a field hospital unit and returned to Leyte. War Hawk returned to New Britain and picked up troops from the Army's 40th Infantry Division and returned to Luzon. =Luzon= The next step in the liberation of the Philippines was the invasion of the island of Luzon, the island on which the capitol Manila resides. The invasion of Luzon began in the Lingayen Gulf on the western side of the island on 9 January 1945. In just a few days, War Hawk and her sister ships had landed almost 175,000 troops, mostly made up of the 6th Army. These troops began a push east, north and south towards Manila. Initially, beach resistance was light and with a low surf, War Hawk was able to put her troops and supplies almost directly onto the beach. There was some fire from Japanese gun emplacements. These emplacements were often made of layers of coconut logs which, being very spongy, were very resistant to everything but the large caliber weapons. =Lingayen Gulf = At 04:10 hours on the morning of 10 January 1945, War Hawk was anchored in Lingayen Gulf where she was attacked in the dark by a Shinyo suicide boat. These boats were small motorboats laden with up to two tons of explosives in the bow. Lookouts reported hearing an approaching boat when the Shinyo rammed the port side of the ship. The explosion blew a hole in hold number three, killing 61 men. (Commander Thompson's official Action Report filed on 18 January 1945 states that 23 people were missing and unaccounted for 20 minutes after the explosion. He does not give details on the wounded.) The damage to the ship was extensive, including flooding in the engine room which knocked out power. With the ship dead in the water, the crew struggled to keep her afloat, restore power and fight off continuing Japanese air attacks throughout the day. That same day, two Landing Craft Infantry (LCI-365 and LCI-974) were sunk in the same area by Shinyo boats. By 11 January, the hole had been buttressed and partial power had been restored, and War Hawk began a long, slow journey back to Leyte Gulf. Two days later, on 13 January, the gun crews downed a kamikaze aircraft, splattering the bow with flaming debris. Once in Leyte Gulf, further and more permanent repairs were made to the ship, enabling her to sail to Manus in the Admiralty Islands for further dry dock work. She set sail for San Francisco Bay on 22 February 1945. =The end of World War II= War Hawk was repaired at an unknown dock facility in San Francisco Bay and set sail for San Diego on 29 May 1945. There she picked up troops from an unspecified division and returned to Guam in the Marianas. She made one more trip back to San Francisco for a load of naval replacements and headed for Eniwetok, Ulithi and Leyte Gulf. While en route, she received word that the United States had dropped two atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese had agreed to an unconditional surrender. =Civilian service= War Hawk was decommissioned on 12 August 1946 in Seattle, Washington. She became the property of the Maritime Commission on 13 August after sailing to Olympia, Washington, and was eventually struck from the Navy List on 8 October 1946. The Waterman Steamship Corporation of Mobile, Alabama, purchased her on 4 February 1948 and operated her until 1964 as a freighter. After her service with Waterman, War Hawk was sold to the Ocean Transport Company of New York and renamed Ocean Dinny. She operated with under Ocean Clippers, Inc., until 1966 when she was sold again to her last owner of record, the Overseas Carrier Corporation. She was scrapped at Kaohsiung in January 1971.

The town is also located on the Great Southern railway line. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. At the , Pingelly had a population of 809. History The town was originally a railway siding along the Great Southern Railway line, built by the Western Australian Land Company, and opened in 1889. Later the same year the company designed the town and made land available. In 1896 the state government purchased the railway and the land and gazetted the townsite in 1898. Its name is Aboriginal in origin and is the name of the Pingeculling Rocks found to the north of the town. The name was first recorded in 1873, and the original settlers referred to the area as Pingegulley for years before the town was gazetted. In early 1898 the population of the town was 89, 52 males and 37 females, however this isn't accurate, as this does not include Aboriginal people. Tenders for the construction of the local agricultural hall were advertised in late 1893, the contract was awarded to Thorne, Bower and Stewart in early 1894. The hall was opened in September of the same year with a tamar hunt and a ball to mark the occasion. Between 1939 and 1941 three motor racing events were held annually in the town, using a circuit which went in a clockwise direction. The last event, won by Harley Hammond in his Marquette Special was the final motor sport event held in Western Australia before racing stopped due to World War 2. Commercial area The shire includes over 1,100 residents living both in town and on rural properties, and is a key agricultural centre, with wheat, barley, sheep and cattle farming being the main activities. Pingelly contains a primary school, Bendigo Bank, shopping facilities - IGA, chemist, post office, specialty shops, arts and craft shop, hospital auxiliary op shop, - accommodation (hotels, B&B;, caravan park), golf course, council offices and a telecentre are located within the town.

The script was written by Aranda and Joaquim Jordà adapting the classic romance of the same name by Prosper Mérimée. Director Vicente Aranda based the plot on Mérimée's original 1847 novella about jealousy and passion, not its famous operatic adaptation by Bizet from 1875, changing some details about the love story between Carmen (Paz Vega) and José (Leonardo Sbaraglia). As in the novella, author Mérimée (Jay Benedict) is portrayed as a French writer who finds the \\"real\\" Carmen in early 19th century Spain.  Plot  While traveling through Andalusia, Spain in 1830, Prosper Mérimée, a French writer, meets José, a wanted criminal. José ends up condemned to death by garroting. The day before José is going to be executed, Mérimée, who has befriended the bandit, visits him in prison. From his jail cell, José begins to narrate his tragic story to the sympathetic writer. José Lizarrabengoa, a serious and proper Basque sergeant in the Spanish army, is stationed in Córdoba. Next to his military headquarters there is a cigar factory where Carmen, a sultry young woman, works. Half gipsy half witch, Carmen is beautiful, flirtatious and has a tempestuous temper. During an argument instigated by Fernanda, a fellow factory worker who has called her gipsy, Carmen retaliates against her rival by slashing Fernanda’s face with a knife. Carmen is arrested and José is left in charge of her custody. On the way to prison, Carmen flirts with José and he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with her. José's breach of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while. Carmen keeps her pact, providing José with his first sexual encounter. He is dazzled with the sexual delight to which she introduces him and he can't keep her out of his mind. José encounters Carmen again while he is in Seville guarding the entrance to the city. Carmen seduces him once more. José turns a blind eye to Carmen's smuggler friends, allowing them to pass his post and, as a reward, she pays him with sex. Without her work at the factory, Carmen is now not only part of a ring of smugglers but supplements her income by prostitution. Blanca, the experienced madame who runs the house Carmen uses for her sexual encounters, warns José against Carmen. Carmen has a shady past and a devilish nature, but it is too late for José. He is already deeply in love. That same night, José waits in vain for Carmen in the brothel. She appears late, arriving in the company of his lieutenant. Furious, José challenges his superior to a sword fight and kills the man. Now a criminal, with his career and place in society lost, José follows Carmen's advise and flees to the countryside, joining some of Carmen's bandit friends: Dancaire, Aristóteles, Señorito, and Juanele. José adapts quickly to his new life. He becomes one of the bandits, feared as \\"José the Basque\\". Soon, Carmen comes to join them in the hideout in the hills. Even in front of the other bandits, Carmen and José restart their passionate affair. Their idyll is broken by the sudden arrival of Carmen's gangster husband, El Tuerto, who has just been released from prison. José is initially extremely jealous but, fearing the consequences of clashing with the dangerous Tuerto, he has no other choice but to accept the circumstances. Carmen assures José that he is the one she loves. Without a choice of her own, she had been sold to El Tuerto when she was fourteen. Carmen makes an effort to make love to José as often as she does to her husband. The other bandits, in order to keep the peace in the group, keep quiet. José continues to work with the bandit group, which is reduced in clashes with the authorities. Eventually José snaps and, with Carmen's aid, murders El Tuerto in a knife fight. Yet more trouble comes between them when the flirtatious Carmen catches the eye of Lucas, a dashing matador. Jose's paranoia and desire to possess Carmen entirely soon overwhelm him. When he discovers Carmen in bed with Lucas, José kills the bullfighter and runs away from the dead man's hacienda. Locked in an empty church with Carmen, José confronts her. Carmen does not love him any more and she is defiant. She dares him to kill her. Crying while they kiss, José murders Carmen with his knife.

Gravel was formerly the Member of Parliament for the riding of Repentigny, as a member of the Bloc Québécois. He was elected to the House of Commons in a November 27, 2006 by- election following the death of Benoît Sauvageau. As a young man Gravel worked in bars in Montreal's Gay Village; he was open about the fact that he was a sex-trade worker during that time.. The Gazette, October 25, 2006. Although Gravel never came out publicly as homosexual during his lifetime, he acknowledged his homosexuality to his biographer, Claude Gravel, prior to his death. He entered the seminary in 1982 and became a priest. Gravel was controversial among the Catholic clergy and laity for his support of abortion rights, euthanasia and same-sex marriage, three issues officially opposed by the Church. He was most recently a priest at St-Joachim de la Plaine Church in La Plaine, Quebec. He was acclaimed as the Bloc's candidate on October 29, 2006. He received a dispensation from Gilles Lussier, Bishop of Joliette, to enter politics. Elected with a large majority in the Bloc stronghold, he became the Bloc critic for seniors' issues. However, following his opposition to Bill C-484, which would have recognized injury of a fetus during a crime as a separate offence from an injury to the mother, and his support for Dr. Henry Morgentaler receiving the Order of Canada, Gravel was ordered by the Vatican to either give up the priesthood or leave politics, and he finally announced he would not run in the 2008 election, saying that the priesthood was his life. He cited as his biggest regret his inability to pass his private member's bill C-490, which aimed to improve seniors' access to guaranteed income supplements.\\"Le député Gravel ne sera pas candidat\\". La Presse, September 3, 2008. He was removed from a position as a catechist in the Quebec Diocese of Joliette during 2010. Gravel then launched a lawsuit against the LifeSiteNews (LSN) agency, a project of the Campaign Life Coalition, for $500,000 in damages. In his motion, Gravel suggested that articles on the LSN website caused him to lose this responsibility. Gravel stated that LSN misrepresented him by identifying him as 'pro-abortion' while he identified himself as 'pro-choice'. In an interview with Radio-Canada, he stated: \\"I am pro-choice and there is not a bishop on Earth that will prevent me from receiving communion, not even the Pope.\\" However, he later stated, \\"I am against abortion, but I am not in favour of the pro-life campaign that condemns all women who get an abortion.\\" In 2014, he died of lung cancer. He was 61.

At first, Shouhei thinks that Kasumi was being strange for her acrobatic skills and her ability to tell different people from the crowd. Later on, Shouhei discovers that Kasumi is actually an anti-terrorist specialist named Rose Hip. Rose Hip, lately, was ordered to engage a right-wing terrorist group led by a man whose codename is Goat. The two soon get wind of his plot to overthrow the elected Japanese government by taking hostages at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and destroy it with explosives.

They argued that Smith was \\"prepared to bend the truth to make a point, turn a stomach, and potentially radicalize a reader.\\" Smith rebutted these criticisms, stating in part, \\"Wynia and Derse assert that I claim bioethics is a monolith. That is not what I write. What I do believe is that bioethics has, generally, crystallized into an orthodoxy, perhaps even an ideology. I acknowledge that disagreements certainly exist within the field. But I view them, with some exceptions, as the arguing of people who agree on fundamentals but disagree on details -- sort of like Catholics bickering with Baptists.\\" Bibliography * The Lawyer Book: A Nuts and Bolts Guide to Client Survival Price Stern Sloan Publishers, 1987, * The Doctor Book: A Nuts and Bolts Guide to Patient Power Price Stern Sloan Publishers, 1988, * The Senior Citizen's Handbook: A Nuts and Bolts Guide to More Comfortable Living Price Stern Sloan Publishers, 1989, * Winning the Insurance Game (1990) Ralph Nader and Wesley J.

The , right- hander was signed by the Cleveland Indians as an amateur free agent before the 1952 season. He played for the Kansas City Athletics (1962), Los Angeles Angels (1962–1964), Milwaukee Braves (1965), Boston Red Sox (1966–1967), Chicago White Sox (1969), and Houston Astros (1970). Born in Chicago, Osinski played baseball, football, and basketball in high school. He almost attended the United States Naval Academy on a football scholarship, but after flunking his physical, he chose instead to sign a contract with the Indians. He played minor league baseball with them for a few years but was plagued by mononucleosis, which he was diagnosed with in 1955. In 1957, Osinski was drafted by the United States Army, serving at Fort Campbell for two years. Unsure whether he should continue playing baseball or not, Osinski tried out with the White Sox in 1959 and was added to one of their minor league clubs. He focused on serving as a relief pitcher and made his major league debut with the Athletics in 1962. Though he did not last long with the Athletics, Osinski impressed the Angels' general manager while pitching for the minor league Portland Beavers. The Angels acquired him in a trade, and he helped give the team one of the best bullpens in the major leagues in 1962. In 1963, he made 16 starts for the club, though he also appeared in 31 games in relief. He posted a 3.48 earned run average (ERA) used mainly in relief in 1964, then was traded to Milwaukee. Osinski posted a 2.82 ERA with the Braves in 1965 and also was asked by broadcaster Howard Cosell to demonstrate the spitball on national television. He was traded to the Red Sox in December, with whom he spent the next two seasons. Osinski had the lowest ERA of his career (2.54) in 1967 and pitched in two games in the 1967 World Series, which Boston lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. However, he was released during 1968 spring training and spent the season in the minor leagues. He earned a spot on the White Sox' roster in 1969 and posted a 3.56 ERA in 51 games. In 1970, he began the year with Houston but was assigned to the minor leagues after three games; he retired after the year. Following his baseball career, Osinski owned a restaurant as well a steel fabrication shop in Oak Forest, Illinois. Later, he sold cars in Sun City, Arizona. He died on September 13, 2013. Early life Osinski was born in Chicago on November 17, 1933, the first child of Anthony and Veronica Osinski. He had one younger sibling, brother Ed. After his first two years of high school, his family moved from Wauconda, Illinois, to Barrington, Illinois. Osinski played baseball, football, and basketball in high school. During his senior year, he threw back-to-back no-hitters and drew the interest of baseball scouts, though Osinski claimed that football and basketball were his main sports. Once he graduated high school, Osinski had planned to attend the United States Naval Academy, but he flunked his physical. The Navy planned to admit him anyway on a football scholarship, causing media outlets to wonder if they were favoring athletes over the general population. Not wanting to be caught up in the controversy, Osinski chose to pursue a baseball career. He worked out with the St. Louis Browns, but Wally Laskowski, a scout for the Cleveland Indians, spotted him and signed him to a $4,000 contract, the most he could get without being considered a bonus baby (which would have forced the Indians to keep the 17-year-old Osinski in the major leagues all of his first professional season without getting a chance to develop his skills at the minor league level). Career =1952–58: Early minor league career, military service= In 1952, Osinski played his first professional season with the Fort Smith Indians of the Class C Western Association. Years later, he recalled facing John Blanchard of the Joplin Miners. \\"I can remember throwing him a fastball and he hit that thing up the light tower in right-center field. I never had a ball hit that hard off me ever.\\" In 37 games (12 starts), he had 11 wins, a 3.58 earned run average (ERA), and 155 strikeouts in 221 innings pitched. However, he led the Western Association in losses (16) and walks (171). Osinski remained at the Class C level in 1953 but this time pitched for the Sherbrooke Indians of the Provincial League. \\"I remember going swimming [at Lake Magog] one time, and I never got sunburned so bad. And then I had to come back and pitch the next day,\\" Osinski recalled about one of his starts with Sherbrooke. \\"I had sunburn all over and I just covered myself up with this Noxzema, and I had a wool sweatshirt on, and I went out there. I was loose, don't get me wrong, I got very loose. I walked 17 batters and I still had a shutout going in the eighth inning...I won the ballgame 5-1.\\" In 30 games (26 starts), he had an 18–7 record, a 2.80 ERA, and 135 strikeouts (a Sherbrooke record) in 196 innings. His 18 wins tied for Marco Mainini for third in the league (behind Bill Diemer's and Michael Munsinger's 20), but his 138 walks were third in the league (behind Bennett Malcolm's 153 and Mainini's 145). In 1954, Osinski was promoted to the Keokuk Kernels of the Class B Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League, where he was teammates with Roger Maris, the future New York Yankees star who would be his roommate with three different teams from 1954 to 1955. His season got off to a strong start, meriting him the start for the league's All-Star Game at midseason. However, he pitched poorly in the second half, battling fatigue and ineffectiveness. He appeared in 27 games (25 starts) for Keokuk, ranking among the league leaders in wins (13, tied with James O'Reilly and Frederick Vogel for seventh), losses (10, tied with four others for 10th), strikeouts (141, sixth), walks (118, third to O'Reilly's 127 and George Aitken's 124), and innings pitched (193, tied with O'Reilly for ninth) while posting a 3.87 ERA. Osinski was assigned to the Tulsa Oilers of the Class AA Texas League to begin the 1955 season, but he only pitched in five games for them. One day, he had to miss a start because of a bad fever; the team physician examined him, and Osinski was diagnosed with mononucleosis, which had led to his fatigue the season before. He was reassigned to the Reading Indians of the Class A Eastern League but collapsed upon arriving at his hotel room in Reading and only pitched in two games, spending much of his time in a hospital as he recovered from the disease. In July, he joined the Spartanburg Peaches of the Class B Tri-State League. He appeared in 12 games (nine starts) for Spartanburg, posting a 5–3 record and a 4.01 ERA while walking 62 batters in 74 innings. In 1956, still feeling the effects of the mononucleosis, he remained at the Class B level, this time with the Fayetteville Highlanders of the Carolina League. In 39 games (20 starts), he had a 10–11 record and a 3.75 ERA in 199 innings pitched. His 131 walks ranked second in the league to Earl Hunsinger's 142. By 1957, Osinski was unsure whether it was worth continuing his baseball career. \\"At that time I was just thinking about hanging it up. I just wasn't moving at all going from Double A to A, to B again, and then to B again which was not considered as strong a league as the Three-I League. You think, oh, you're done.\\" Drafted by the United States Army, he spent 1957 and 1958 serving in the military. This did not prevent him from playing baseball, though, as he was assigned to the baseball team at Fort Campbell. =1959–61: Becoming a relief pitcher= In 1959, Osinski met with the Chicago White Sox, who invited him to spring training, then assigned him to the Duluth-Superior Dukes of the Class C Northern League. \\"I decided, well, the best way for me to [reach the major leagues was] to become a relief pitcher and forget about the starting,\\" Osinski said. The league was lower than those he'd pitched in the last two seasons, but Osinski looked at it as an opportunity to see if he could still pitch. Only making four starts, he led the league with 50 games pitched, posting an 8–9 record, a 2.41 ERA, and 58 walks in 138 innings. Though primarily used in relief, he tied with Dooley Womack for 10th in the league in strikeouts. Osinski began the 1960 season with the Charleston White Sox of the Class A South Atlantic League. He had a 2.31 ERA in 14 games for them but spent most of the year with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Illinois- Indiana-Iowa League. In 47 games, he had a 9–2 record, a 2.89 ERA, 115 strikeouts, and 60 walks in 81 innings. He returned to Charleston in 1961 and led the league with 56 games pitched, posting an 8–6 record, a 2.50 ERA, 114 strikeouts, and 55 walks in 108 innings while drawing the attention of major league clubs as a bullpen asset. =1962–64: Debut, success in the bullpen, a chance to start= In 1962, the Kansas City Athletics signed Osinski to a contract and invited him to spring training; he pitched so well, he began the season in their bullpen. Osinski made his major league debut in relief on April 11, 1962 against the Minnesota Twins at Kansas City Municipal Stadium. He pitched the top of the ninth inning and gave up three earned runs in an 8–0 Athletics loss, claiming second baseman Bernie Allen as his first strikeout. He pitched in three more games that month, struggled with his control, and was sent down to the minor leagues. First, he pitched for the Albuquerque Dukes of the Texas League, but on May 29, he was transferred to the Portland Beavers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). Used often, he posted a 1.06 ERA in a 20-day span where he made 16 appearances; this earned him a selection to the PCL All-Star Team. The PCL All-Stars played an exhibition game against the Los Angeles Angels on July 11, and Fred Haney (the Angels' general manager) was impressed with the right-hander. On July 21, the Angels traded for him, sending cash and a player to be named later (Ted Bowsfield) to the Athletics. Osinski was added to the Angels' roster. Osinski pitched very well for the rest of the season, forming what Sports Illustrated called \\"one of the strongest bullpens in the majors,\\" along with Art Fowler, Tom Morgan, and Jack Spring. He joined the Angels three days after the trade and earned his first big league save that day with two scoreless innings in Game 2 of a doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles at Chavez Ravine Stadium. Then, nine days later, he got his first major league win with a scoreless inning against the Cleveland Indians. After Bo Belinsky allowed three runs in the second inning of a game against the Boston Red Sox on August 15, Osinski entered, stranded a runner on second base, and threw innings of relief, allowing just one run and picking up the victory as the Angels won 5–4. From August 21 through 23, he pitched in all three games of a series against the New York Yankees, losing the game on the 22nd after giving up two runs in innings but winning the game on the 23rd when he threw five scoreless innings of relief as the Angels scored the winning run in the 13th inning. In 33 games for the Angels in his rookie year, Osinski was 6–4 with four saves and an ERA of 2.82. Including his Kansas City statistics, his final ERA was 3.97. He credited Angel pitching coach Marv Grissom for his improvement. Osinski, circa 1964 A broken finger suffered in Osinski's first game of 1963 (April 13) kept the pitcher inactive until May 2. After just five games back, Osinski was inserted into the Angels' starting rotation. In his first major league start, against the Red Sox on May 16, he threw a complete game but took the loss, surrendering three runs in eight innings at Fenway Park. On June 4, he threw a three-hit shutout, beating the Chicago White Sox 1–0 at Chavez Ravine Stadium. Failing to make it through the first inning after allowing four runs to the Twins on June 8, he made another start on June 10 against his former team, throwing a complete game as the Angels beat the Athletics 13–3. Nine days later, in the first game of a doubleheader, he threw another complete game against the Athletics, limiting them to two runs in a 4–2 victory. He had a 6–5 record and 3.06 ERA through July 11 but was moved back to the bullpen after starting his 13th game that day. For most of the rest of the year, he served as a relief pitcher, though he would make three more starts. In a 3–0 loss to Minnesota on August 8, he threw shutout innings in relief of Paul Foytack. In 47 games (16 starts), he had an 8–8 record, four saves, a 3.28 ERA, 100 strikeouts, and 80 walks in innings. Osinski began 1964 in the bullpen again; this year, all but four of his appearances would be in relief. His ERA was at 6.00 on May 25, but he had a 2.61 ERA over the rest of the season. On May 29, he threw five shutout innings of relief and struck out 10 batters in a 3–2 loss to the Orioles. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers on June 14, he gave up two runs (one earned) in five innings of relief, but the Angels lost 6–5. He threw three shutout innings and picked up a save against Kansas City on June 25 in a 4–3 victory. On August 20, he entered a game against Detroit in the sixth inning and threw four shutout innings, allowing only one hit and picking up the win in a 4–3 victory. He was used to start the last game of the season on October 4 and threw a six-inning shutout in a rain-shortened, 3–0 victory over the Twins. In 47 games, he had a 3–3 record, two saves, a 3.48 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 39 walks in 93 innings. On October 14, the Angels traded a player to be named later to the Milwaukee Braves for Ron Piche and Phil Roof. The Angels named Osinski as the other player on November 29. =1965–67: Demonstrating the spitball; pitching in the World Series= In 1965, Osinski was used exclusively in relief. This season, he never pitched more than innings in a game. The inning appearance came on July 15; he relieved Ken Johnson with two outs in the sixth inning and threw scoreless baseball the rest of the game, earning the save in a 9–6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. His most memorable moment with the Braves came on July 30. \\"We're playing the [San Francisco] Giants...and [Bob] Shaw was pitching for the Giants and throwing nothing but spitters. I remember [manager Bobby Bragan] calling the bullpen and asking if anybody down there threw a spitter, and I got elected.\\" Bragan ordered him to throw the pitch and be very obvious about it; he threw two shutout innings as the Braves lost 9–2. The next day, broadcaster Howard Cosell had him demonstrate the spitball to national television on the game's pre-game show. Osinski claimed that after the game, he never had a strike called for him all season. Actually, he would strike out 17 more batters in 1965, but his strikeout-to-walk ratio flipped, as his walk total surpassed his strikeout total in the season's final months. In 61 games, he had an 0–3 record but posted a 2.82 ERA, with 54 strikeouts and 40 walks in 83 innings. He also had six saves, which would be a career high. The Braves moved to Atlanta following the 1965 season, but Osinski never played for them in Georgia. Instead, on December 16, 1965, he was traded with Bob Sadowski to the Boston Red Sox for Arnold Earley, Lee Thomas, and a player to be named later (Jay Ritchie on January 11, 1966). Interestingly, his 1966 Topps baseball card listed his team as the Braves on the front but mentioned the trade to the Red Sox on the back.\\"Dan Osinski,\\" Topps, 1966, #168 Dick Radatz was the main relief pitcher for the Red Sox, but Osinski was expected by manager Billy Herman to provide a strong second option in 1966. Hall of Famer Ted Williams said, \\"I'd hate to hit against [Osinski]. What a motion he's got. He's got to help this club.\\" He suffered blown saves in his first two games of the year and had a 12.27 ERA over his first five games. He had gotten his ERA down to 5.00 on May 28, but it rose to 9.00 after he gave up five runs in one inning of a 12–2 loss to the Washington Senators on June 2. He had a 2.67 ERA for the rest of the season but was used mostly in losses. In the first game of a doubleheader against Washington on July 4, he threw innings in a 6–4 loss. After September 6, he was not used again by the Red Sox until the 27th, when he was used to start the second game of a doubleheader against the White Sox, Boston's last game of the year. Osinski limited Chicago to one run over innings and picked up the win as Boston prevailed 2–1. In 44 games (one start), he had a 4–3 record, two saves, a 3.61 ERA, 44 strikeouts, and 28 walks in innings. Entering the 1967 season, Osinski was projected to serve as a middle reliever for Boston. In his first appearance of the year on April 16, he threw six shutout innings in an 18-inning, 7–6 loss to the Yankees. On May 7, he limited the Twins to one run in five innings of relief, picking up the victory as the Red Sox won 9–6. He threw eight innings over a two-day span on July 28 and July 29 in two losses to the Twins. In 34 games, he had a 3–1 record, two saves, a career-low 2.54 ERA, 38 strikeouts, and 14 walks in innings. He was part of the Red Sox \\"Impossible Dream\\" team that won their first American League pennant since 1946. The Boston Herald Traveler said of him, \\"Osinski is not a sentimentalist. Rather, he's a pro's pro. Though he has only five years in the major leagues, he has the qualities --maturity, judgment and a dogged competitiveness -- that often are never found in men with twice his longevity.\\" In the 1967 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Osinski appeared in two games. He gave up two hits and a run in an inning in Game 3, which Boston lost 5–2. Osinski also got the final out against St. Louis in Game 7, but Boston lost 7–2 as the Cardinals clinched the World Series championship. =1968–70: Final seasons= Despite his low ERA in 1967, Osinski was released by Boston during spring training in 1968; he said later he found out the news not from the team but from a sportswriter. On April 29, the Chicago native was signed by the White Sox and assigned to the Hawaii Islanders of the PCL. He was used heavily by Hawaii, throwing a streak of over 25 scoreless innings in May. For the second time in his career, he was named to the PCL All-Star team at midseason. In 51 games (all in relief), he had an 8–2 record, a 2.39 ERA, 68 strikeouts, and six walks in 98 innings. The White Sox invited Osinski to spring training in 1969 and added him to their bullpen, where he remained all season. This year, he never threw more than three innings in a game. He allowed a run in two innings on May 11 but picked up the save in a 7–5 victory over Cleveland. On May 16, after Wilbur Wood gave up three runs and allowed the Senators to tie the game in the seventh inning, Osinski entered the game with one out, shut out the Senators for the rest of the game, and got the win as the White Sox prevailed 7–6. On May 22, he gave up a run in innings but picked up another save in a 7–3 victory over Detroit. In 51 games (his total with Hawaii the previous year), he compiled a 5–5 record with two saves, a 3.56 ERA, 27 strikeouts, and 23 walks in innings. Osinski's contract was sold to the Houston Astros on December 2. Not a part of their roster entering spring training, he nonetheless began the 1970 season in their bullpen. He only appeared in three games with the Astros, though, posting a 9.82 ERA. On April 16, he entered a game against the Giants in the 10th inning. He gave up a leadoff triple to Bobby Bonds but struck out Al Gallagher and got Willie Mays to hit into a groundout. Left-hander Jack DiLauro then replaced him to face the left-handed hitting Willie McCovey, but McCovey hit a home run to give the Giants a 7–5 victory. Since Osinski's runner provided the margin of victory, he was charged with the loss. It was his final major league appearance, as the Astros optioned him to the Oklahoma City 89ers of the Class AAA American Association on April 22, where he spent the rest of the season. In 45 games, he had a 6–8 record, a 2.42 ERA, 50 strikeouts, and 12 walks in 67 innings. He was claimed on waivers by the San Diego Padres after the season but chose to retire instead. His major league career totals include a 29–28 record in 324 games (21 starts), five complete games, two shutouts, 122 games finished, 18 saves, and an ERA of 3.34. He had 400 strikeouts in innings pitched for a 6.11 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ratio. Defensively, he made no errors in his last five major league seasons (193 games). Personal life In July, 1960, Osinski married Peggy Frew, a Barrington resident. The couple had one son, Daniel D. A Portland sportswriter called him The Silencer during his time with the Beavers, and the nickname stuck for the rest of his career. Osinski worked as a banker during offseasons while he was still playing baseball. Following his career, he opened a restaurant called \\"Squire's Inn\\" in Oak Forest, Illinois. He also operated a steel fabrication shop in Oak Forest, called \\"DanO.\\" In 1990, Osinski and his family moved to Sun City, Arizona, where he worked as a used car salesman. While he was with the Braves, Sports Illustrated reported a humorous encounter he had with a waitress at a restaurant. Asked if he wanted his pizza sliced into eight pieces, Osinski responded, \\"Better make it six. I can't eat eight.\\" He died in Sun City on September 13, 2013.

Literature moved in the direction of proletariat writings during the interwar years, and the remainders of folklore had been reduced to virtual insignificance.Algulin, pp.194-196 Proletarian writing had its strongest period in 1920-1940. Artur Lundkvist and the literary group Fem unga played a key role in introducing literary modernism with an anthology published in 1929.Den svenska litteraturen V, Bonniers 1989, page 177 Notable proletarian writers were Moa Martinson (1890-1964), who wrote about the difficulties women had in factory and farm work; and her husband, Harry Martinson (1904-1978), who wrote about the fragility of human beings. But the most distinguished proletarian writer of the time was Ivar Lo-Johansson (1901-1990), writing about the Swedish land-workers in novels, short stories and journalism, and also engaging in public debates about many other topics.Modern Literature , Swedish Institute, accessed October 17, 2006 In the late 1930s, the political developments in Germany had their effects on Swedish literature. Taking a stand against National Socialism, Pär Lagerkvist wrote the novels Bödeln (1933) and Dvärgen (The Dwarf) (1944), both investigating human evil. A stand again National Socialism was also made by Karin Boye in the novel Kallocain (1940) set in a future totalitarian world; the novel has since been translated into ten languages. During the war, Eyvind Johnson also took a recognized stand with his The Krilon Group series (1941-1943), a massive work speaking strongly in favour of democratic values, condemning dictatorship and worship of power.Algulin, p.201-202 Notes and references *Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. *Gustafson, Alrik, Svenska litteraturens historia, 2 volums (Stockholm, 1963).

Though awareness for linguistic diversity is a policy target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a \\"common language policy.\\" Based on the \\"principle of subsidiarity\\", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages.Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 149 to 150, Official Journal C 321E of 29 December 2006.

However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states. Orban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity.Leonard Orban, Introductory statement – European Parliament Hearing, (PDF) European Parliament website, November 27, 2006.

The assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too \\"light\\" for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio.

Views on multilingualism In his hearing at the European Parliament, Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy, emphasising foreign language learning and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement.Summary of hearing of Leonard Orban, Commissioner-designate for Multilingualism, European Parliament Press Release, November 27, 2006.

Retrieved on February 1, 2007. Orban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every enlargement and assured the Members of the European Parliament that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portfolio would contribute to economic competitiveness, the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue. Orban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, \\"Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness.\\" In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, \\"At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism.\\" According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, \\"our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian.\\" He added that, \\"The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners.\\" Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, \\"Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted,\\" which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, \\"When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States.\\" Orban's remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and Juvenes Translatores,ec.europa.eu/translatores – Juvenes Translatores contest (latin: young translators) a translation contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Social Fund and immigration initiatives. He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part. On planning further policy, Orban promised to, \\"carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a Ministerial conference to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area.\\" His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission \\"A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism\\" on 22 November 2005.

Its name translates roughly to cloudy because of its appearance. It is about 12–17% alcohol by volume, averaging 15% with some as high as 20%.  Description  Sake is usually filtered to remove grain solids left behind after the fermentation process. Nigori sake is filtered using a broader mesh, resulting in the permeating of fine rice particles and a far cloudier drink. Unfiltered sake is known as doburoku (どぶろく, but also 濁酒) and was originally brewed across Japan by farming families. However, it was banned in the Meiji period, though it has since been revived as a local brewing tradition. The area around Mihara village in southern Shikoku is especially well known for its doburoku breweries.  Commercial reintroduction  Brewer Tokubee Masuda, of Kyoto-based Tsukino Katsura brewery, which began in 1675, looked to bring back hundred-year-old recipes and traditional production methods available to modernize their products. Beginning in 1964 (or 1966), Masuda began lobbying the Japanese government to relax sake production-laws in order to produce an unfiltered sake that would be cloudy and offer a visual component, similar to European wines. The result was a sake that was cloudy, effervescent, unpasteurized, and slightly sweeter. Author John Gauntner, discussing the production process that allowed nigori to be considered as sake, notes: > \\"What they did was create a cage-like device, an insert with holes in its > walls that fit into a tank of sake. The sake that leaked through the holes > in the center of the insert was then drawn off and bottled. The government > determined that as long as the holes in the mesh were no larger than 2 > millimeters in diameter, the result of filtration using the cage could > legally be considered sake. Hence, nigori was born as a genre of sake. Other > breweries later followed suit, using their own contraptions.\\" Gauntner also remarked that currently, most brewers no longer bother filtering out the sake, but will instead dilute the final product with filtered sake. Formerly, only water could be added to sake after fermenting, but current laws state that only water and sake can be added afterward. In 2010, a brewer from Akita Prefecture came up with a dark version of nigori sake, the color of which is due to the addition of edible finely powdered charcoal.  Consumption  Nigori sake is generally the sweetest of all sake, with a fruity nose and a mild flavor, making a great drink to complement spicy foods or as a dessert wine. Before serving, the bottle is shaken properly to mix the sediment with the sake, to obtain the full range of flavor and its signature look. It is advised that it be served well-chilled, storing it in an ice bucket to keep it from warming up between servings. It is recommended, as with most sake, to consume the entire bottle once opened before it begins to oxidize, altering its flavor. Nigori sake is more popular in the United States than in Japan, as are other less traditional varieties, which has led to an increase of American sake brewers.

It flourished at the dawn of the 20th century with Elsa Beskow (1874–1953), who wrote and illustrated some 40 children's stories between 1897–1952. Her books were beloved and have continued to be reprinted in Sweden and many other languages. In the 1930s a new awareness of children's needs emerged. It was realized that children did not only warrant disciplinary and moralizing literature, but also childlike books to foster their imagination. This manifested itself shortly after World War II, when Astrid Lindgren published Pippi Longstocking in 1945. Pippi's rebellious behavior initially sparked resistance among some defenders of cultural values, but her work was eventually accepted, and with that children's literature was freed from the obligation to promote moralism.Svensson, S., Så skulle världen bli som ny, in Lönnroth, Delblanc & Göransson (ed.), Den svenska litteraturen, vol. 3. (1999)More information about Pippi Longstocking in Swedish culture can be found in the article Pippi Longstocking: Swedish rebel and feminist role model from the Swedish Institute, accessed October 15, 2006 Astrid Lindgren continued to publish many bestselling children's books, which eventually made her the most read Swedish author of all categories with over 100 million copies printed throughout the world, translated into over 80 languages. Lindgren showed in many other books her fine comprehension of childlike thought and values; in The Brothers Lionheart about death, as well as a tale of bravery; in Mio, My Son a fairy tale about friendship. However, not all her stories had deep messages, at least on the surface. Three books on Karlsson-on-the-Roof (1955, '62, '68) are about a short, chubby and mischievous man with a propeller on his back, who is befriended by a boy. The stories of Karlsson-on-the-Roof became one of the most loved children's stories in Russia during the Soviet era. And in twelve books Astrid wrote about Emil of Maple Hills, a boy on the Småland countryside in the early 1900s, who continuously gets intro trouble because of his pranks. She also wrote many other appreciated books; most of them were filmed, some with good results that have led to them being continuously rerun on Swedish television. One of the few fantasy writers in Swedish literature was Tove Jansson (1914–2001), who wrote her stories of the Moomins in nine books and four picture books between 1946 and 1993. Jansson was from Finland's Swedish- speaking minority, and wrote in Swedish. The Moomins are trolls that live in an economically and politically independent state, without any material necessities. Perhaps this explains the vast popularity the Moomins have enjoyed in many different countries. The Moomin books have been translated into over 30 languages.Moomin books, Tampere Art Museum, accessed October 20, 2006 More recently, other children's authors have become notable, such as Maria Gripe, Gunnel Linde, Inger and Lasse Sandberg, Sven Nordqvist with the Pettson and Findus series, Moni Brännström, Anders Jacobsson and Sören Olsson. Among the Swedish comic book artists who also illustrates children's books is Joakim Lindengren.

Background The term \\"virtual artifact\\" has been used in a variety of ways in scientific and public discourse. Previously it has referred to objects of different nature (e.g. images, user interfaces, models, prototypes, computer animation, virtual books) that exist in digital environments. The concept behind the term is rapidly developing and expanding as new phenomena emerge in the virtual domain. =History of the phenomenon= Imaginary worlds, characters, items, etc. have been described in stories and tales since the dawn of humanity. In the philosophic discourse, utopias have existed where extensive systems and their components have been depicted in detail. Imaginary artifacts have been described and created in terms of language and visual presentation. The development of the visual presentation techniques (e.g. linear perspective, cinematography) enabled more sophisticated methods to describe these artifacts, events and entities in painting, photography and film. Moreover, virtual artifacts were (and still are) commonly found in environments that require a strong imaginary aspect in order to be experienced, such as radio shows, novels, tabletop role-playing games, etc. The development of computing enabled the creation of interactive virtual environments that were based on digital technologies and new methods of presentation. In digital environments, virtual artifacts became independent entities that could exist and interact outside the human mind. Even previously unknown, complex forms and imaginary artifacts (e.g. fractals) could be created and represented in these environments.Steven R. Holtzman. Digital Mantras - The Languages of Abstract and Virtual Worlds, p. 193-211. The MIT Press 1996.  In digital environments  Humans have expanded the existing environment to the virtual domain. Virtual artifacts can be seen as an essential cultural phenomenon in modern society. Virtual artifacts bear meanings and functions and since they are part of the world they affect real world events and people's lives. Virtual artifacts have certain similarities to real-life artifacts even though they do not have physical properties in the traditional sense. However, real-life objects and environments can be simulated in digital environments (like computer games, 3D modeling or virtual reality). Simulated virtual objects (photorealistic VA) and environments have a model in the real world; however, depending on the context, an abstract virtual artifact isn't necessarily dependent on the laws of physics or causality.Vince, John. Introduction to virtual reality. Springer-Verlag London limited 2004. Some virtual artifacts are purely abstract in their nature, therefore they can't model real-life objects or phenomena. For example, computer programs or digital user interfaces, while often containing representative components of real-life objects, can't exist in physical terms. These virtual artifacts do not have to be comprehensible to humans at all; they can be created and understood solely by artificial intelligence. Virtual artifacts can have physical properties (for example color, length) depending on the environment they exist in. These physical properties can be presented and perceived using a certain medium such as a computer screen. On the other hand, virtual artifacts can also contain properties that aren't perceptible. Due to their immaterial nature they can be flexibly accessed, reproduced and archived—even simultaneously by multiple users. =Purposes and uses= * In the field of archaeology, real world artifacts are modeled/reproduced in a digital environment, where they can be modified, reconstructed, and archived. Also, whole historical sites and buildings (e.g. Theban Mapping Project) are reconstructed in a virtual environment. * Virtual artifacts are a crucial part of digital, imaginary game worlds. * Artwork (e.g. paintings, interactive installations, music videos) that is presented/archived in a virtual environment can be considered as a virtual artifact. * Virtual artifacts (e.g. parts of simulated experiments, models) are used in many areas of scientific research (e.g. medical science, chemistry, astronomy). * Designers (such as fashion designers, industrial designers, architects) use virtual artifacts (e.g. prototypes, testing environments) in their work process. * Virtual art, artists using virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality as a medium produce virtual artworks.  Virtual consumerism  Virtual artifacts can have a virtual and/or \\"real\\" exchange value, and thus can be considered as products. A person or other juristically defined actor can claim ownership and invest money in virtual artifacts. Virtual artifacts can also be valuable in an economical sense outside the environment (e.g. a virtual world such as ones found in massively multiplayer online games) they are created in. For example, game items and characters are valued in terms of real currencies.Lehdonvirta, Vili. Real-Money Trade of Virtual Assets: New Strategies for Virtual World Operators. Proceedings of Future Play 2005, Michigan State University, 13–15 October 2005. Within many virtual worlds, there exists a virtual economy that often mimics real-life commercial features and models such as trading with in- game virtual artifacts, virtual currencies, supply and demand, etc. There is a viable real-life business model based on the exchange of virtual artifacts within a virtual environment. One example is the social networking game Habbo Hotel; in Habbo-world, users buy virtual products such as furniture for their virtual hotel room with real money. Many online games require a paid subscription for providing access to the game world, creating revenue to the creator of the world. Moreover, virtual game environments have also created commercial models around them. In fact, the market for virtual artifacts such as game items or virtual property is booming. In China, for example, people are hired to play online games to develop game characters and collect game resources. Furthermore, virtual environments have enabled the production and commercialization of virtual artifacts created by end-users—creating new markets and effectively blurring the line between \\"real\\" and virtual consumerism.

Over the course of the band, the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter. The music has run a gamut from intense, all-acoustic free improvisation, to complex, modernistic rock composition; electronic noise to punk-inspired jazz.Scene Point Blank interview http://www.scenepointblank.com/features/47 Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk, death metal, free jazz, and no wave. History The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago, Illinois as a punk jazz trio, with Hal Russell (tenor and soprano saxophones, trumpet), Chad Organ (tenor saxophone) and Weasel Walter (drums). The band derived their moniker from Russell's birthname, Harold Luttenbacher.Epitonic feature http://www.epitonic.com/index.jsp?refer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epitonic.com%2Fartists%2Ftheflyingluttenbachers.html Russell left the band in June 1992, and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers' first 7\\" record. The band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians, including Fred Lonberg-Holm, Kurt Johnson, Jeb Bishop, Alex Perkolup, Mick Barr, Ed Rodriguez, Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke. The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust, Arab On Radar, Lightning Bolt, U.S. Maple, Erase Errata, Bobby Conn, and Wolf Eyes. Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland, California in 2003, beginning yet another incarnation of the group. The live band played their final concert in November 2006. The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album (recorded solo by Walter). In 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival. The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn, NY on October 17-19. Conceptual continuity Since 1996’s Revenge album, the Flying Luttenbachers’ musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the self-obliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath. The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities: The Void (a dark, silent spectre detailed on 2004’s album of the same name) and The Iridescent Behemoth (a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003’s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album). The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes.

Introduced as the top-level trim in the new Holden FJ range of 1953, the Special was complemented by the entry-level Holden Standard and the mid-range Holden Business. The Business was in fact already available, introduced in July 1953 in the 48 series first seen in 1948. Three months later, the FJ was introduced, therefore forming a three-model lineup based around one car. A \\"Standard\\"-type variant also existed in the 48 series, but had been marketed simply as the \\"Holden\\".Wright (2008), p. 205. There were also coupé utility and panel van variants, introduced in 1951 (48) and 1953 (FJ) respectively. These were both based on the Standard, although neither were badged this way. Collectively, the two cars were known as the Holden utility and panel van. From March 1957 the sedan, utility and panel van body styles were complemented by a new five-door station wagon. The wagon was marketed as the \\"Station Sedan\\" in both Standard and Special trim levels.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 57 The Business sedan was deleted from the Holden lineup in mid-1959, during the FC production run, leaving just the Standard and Special. However, in 1962 the Holden Premier was introduced with the EJ series, becoming the new flagship, with the Special assigned as the mid-range Holden. This model trio continued until the 1968 HK series. The Standard became the Belmont, the Special the Kingswood, with the Premier staying as is. A new extended-length Brougham also joined the line-up, becoming Holden's topline offering.  First generation (1953–1956)  = 48 = The Business was introduced in July 1953, in four-door sedan form only, as a better equipped version of the basic Holden 48-215 series sedan introduced in 1948 and was specifically aimed at the taxi market. Improvements included passenger grab rails, door pull handles, seat kick plates, heavy-duty seats, floor mats, a heavy-duty battery and a boot lid handle. The Business Sedan was officially designated as model 48-215-257.Darwin (2002), p. 223. Like the basic Holden sedan, it was powered by a 132.5 cubic inch six cylinder engine.Darwin (2002), p. 292. = FJ = Only three months after the introduction of the original Business, the 48 series was replaced by the revised FJ Business. This series also included a new trim level, the Special, which was positioned above the Business in terms of price and equipment level. The new Business was designated as model FJ-217.Darwin (2002), p. 225.  Second generation (1956–1960)  = FE = The FE series of July 1956 continued to offer Standard, Business and Special sedans but now featured new body styling, a longer wheelbase (up to 105 inches), a more powerful engine (up to 70 bhp), revised electrics, steering and interior trim. The Business sedan was designated as model FE-217. From March 1957 a station wagon body style was offered in the FE series, but only in Standard and Special trim.Darwin (2002), p. 228. = FC = The revised FC series introduced in May 1958 was a face-lift, offering only minor improvements over the FE. The Business was designated the FC-217.Darwin (2002), p. 229.  Third generation (1960–1962)  = FB = Holden FB Standard Sedan. Holden FB Trim. Holden Dealer logo FB. Holden FB Owners Manual. The introduction of the FB series in January 1960 saw the Business sedan discontinued, leaving the Standard and the Special as the only Holden sedans for the first years of the new decade.Darwin (2002), p. 230. Holden Produced 174,747 Holden FB's. The FB continued the General Motors Holden's (GMH) unique Australian mid-size GM offering, in contrast to the larger American, or smaller English variants. With predominantly US design features such as the FB's rear pointed twin fins, wrap around windscreen A-pillar, and new American Style dashboard with speedo featuring an orange-coloured indicator band instead of a needle pointer. The Holden FB and larger US variants such as the Chevrolet and Pontiac had a lot in common.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com The FB Holden was manufactured with four common body styles. The Special sedan (model FB/225), Special station wagon (model FB/229), Standard sedan (model FB/215), Standard station wagon (model FB/219), Standard panel van (model FB/2104) and standard utility (model FB/2106).Holden FB Workshop Manual Page 2 The FB Holden also saw the end of the Nitrocellulose Lacquer (Duco) finishes. These early model FBs are very sought after in their original paint, as Holden introduced the \\"Magic Mirror\\" Acrylic finished in May 1960. With these change came new colours. Out were Nitro colours, Alpine Blue, Arctic Beige, Belmont Green, Biscay Green, Buckskin, Corana Grey, Desert Glow, Fernando Yellow, Lucerne Blue, Mandan Red, Raphael Ivory, Royal Glow, Sandstone Beige. All very rare colours to find on an FB Holden today, due to the five-month production window.General Motors Holden LTD Colour Identification Chart 1960 On the subject of windows, the FB had 27 percent more glass area than the previous Holden the FC. The FB was also lower wider and longer than the FC.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=349490 The Holden FB panel van proved to be a big hit in the commercial sectors. The new 1960 FB panel van was the first Holden with a high roof. The FC Holden van was more or less a windowless station wagon in comparison. Holden FB is also noted as Holden's first export left hand drive car. The first of these cars being delivered to Hawaii.

The Hydramatic was fully imported from the USA (used in many General Motors cars at the time).Holden History http://www.historyofholden.com/ek-holden The Hydramatic transmission was generally limited to the Special sedan (EK/225) and Special station sedan (EK/229); however, some examples of dealer orders for automatic transmissions exist with one known standard sedan (EK/215) Hydramatic (Snowcrest White, body no. 57, Sydney) with delivery paperwork to authenticate.http://www.fbekholden.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2251&highlight;=snowcrest Further changes included the updating to electric windshield wipers (the previous model FB used vacuum wipers). The other changes were more cosmetic. Holden implemented stronger seat material \\"ElastoFab\\" due to the FB trim splitting at the seams quite easily, with the horizontal mid seat seam trim join. Holden also added a new grille, plenum chamber (Wiper Vent) cover, larger bumper bar over-riders, wider rear-view mirror, different badging and side trim style.

Fourth generation (1962–1965)  = EJ = Holden Special (EJ) station sedan In 1962, Holden launched a completely new, lower-profile streamlined body with more interior space, new foam-padded seating and better all-round visibility. The \\"Premier\\" model was introduced and the name \\"Premier\\", was to be identified with luxury Classic Holden Cars for 16 years. The EJ Premier, first with standard metallic paint and auto transmission, offered leather trim bucket seats, heater, carpet, floor console and whitewalls. The EJ had Duo Servo brakes, strengthened front suspension, safety belt anchorages. = EH = Holden Special (EH) sedan The EH was introduced in 1963 and was the first Holden to incorporate the new \\"Red\\" engine, with a 7 main bearing crankshaft instead of the 4 main bearing crankshaft used in the \\"Grey\\" engine.Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 235  Fifth generation (1965–1968)  Holden HD Special Sedan = HD = The HD was introduced in 1965. It had a completely new body, which was wider and longer than that of the EH and offered significant increases in passenger space, load space and equipment levels. Body styling exhibited strong similarities to Vauxhall's FC Victor of the previous year, including that car's unusual concave rear window. Disc brakes were offered for the first time on a Holden model and the optional Hydramatic three–speed automatic transmission as used in the EH was replaced by a Powerglide two– speed unit.Holden HD at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au Retrieved on 14 October 2010 Holden HR Special = HR = The HR was introduced in 1966, featuring a revised grille, a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels. Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after the launch of the HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, windscreen washers, reversing lights, padded sun visors and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.Holden Heritage, Eighth Edition, 1998, pages 34-35  Notes   References   Special Category:Cars introduced in 1953 Category:1960s cars Category:Cars of Australia Category:Mid-size cars Category:Police vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons ","title":"Holden Special"},{"id":"7708245","text":"The Mike Walsh Show was an Australian variety daytime television series.

As host, Howard did not appear as a horror host character but as himself. He moved to New York City in 1967 as one of the original members of WNEW-TV's Ten O'Clock News team. After a brief reporting stint at WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, Howard returned to New York as a reporter for WPIX in 1968, staying there until 1970 when he took a job as press secretary to Howard J. Samuels during his unsuccessful run for Governor of New York; he later returned to WPIX as a political reporter. Howard moved to Hartford, Connecticut to work for WFSB as a reporter and weekend anchor, and then arrived in Philadelphia in 1977 to become the 5:30 p.m. co-anchor of WPVI's Action News; the newscast would expand to an hour in 1981.

Distinguishing features where experimentation within a variety of styles, usually free prose without rhymes or metric syllables. Leading modernistic poets were Artur Lundkvist (1906-1991), Gunnar Ekelöf (1907-1968), Edith Södergran (1892-1923), Karin Boye (1900-1941), Harry Martinson (1904-1978) and Erik Lindegren (1910-1968).* Lönnroth, L., Delblanc S., Göransson, S. Den svenska litteraturen (ed.), 3 volumes (1999) Gunnar Ekelöf has become described as Sweden's first surrealistic poet, after he debuted with the poetry collection sent på jorden in 1932, a work was too unconventional to become appreciated.Lundkvist, Martinsson, Ekelöf, by Espmark & Olsson, in Delblanc, Lönnroth, Göransson, vol 3 But Ekelöf moved towards romanticism and got betters reviews for his second poetry collection Dedikation in 1934. A work that became influential for later Swedish poets was his Färjesång in 1941, a finely expressed blend of romanticism, surrealism and the dark clouds of the ongoing World War II. Edith Södergran did not achieve fame during her lifetime, but is today regarded as one of the foremost modernistic poets from the Nordic countries, and she has been translated into all major languages. Her first poetry collection was Dikter in 1916, but it was her second collection, Septemberlyran (1918) that caught the attention of a larger audience. It is distinguished by a kind of beauty that had not been seen for a long time. Södergran suffered from tuberculosis, which took her life as early as 1923. Harry Martinson had an unparalleled feeling of nature, in the spirit of Linnaeus. As typical for his generation, he wrote with a free prosody, not bound by rhymes and syllables. A classic work was the autobiographical Flowering Nettles, in 1935. His most remarkable work was however Aniara, 1956, a story of a spaceship drifting through space.Algulin, p.230-231 Artur Lundkvist played a vital role in promoting modernist poetry in Sweden. His poetry was influenced by surrealism, Walt Whitman and spanish language poets like Lorca and Pablo Neruda. Karin Boye was one of the most important modernist poets in the 1920s and 1930s with collections like Moln (1922), Gömda land (1925), Härdarna (1927) and För trädets skull (1935).Lars Lönnroth, Sven Delblanc Den svenska litteraturen V, 1989 p.35-40 Hjalmar Gullberg (1898-1961) wrote many mystical and Christianity influenced collections, such as Andliga övningar (Spiritual Exercises, 1932), but continued to develop and published his greatest work, Ögon, läppar (Eyes, Lips), in 1959. In the 1940s Erik Lindegren become one of the leading modernist poets with the surreal \\"blown-up sonnets\\" of mannen utan väg (The man without a way, 1942) and the more romantic Sviter (Suites, 1947), a collection that is considered to be the highpoint of 1940s Swedish poetry.Lars Lönnroth, Sven Delblanc Den svenska litteraturen V, 1989 p.226-228 The arguably most famous Swedish poet of the 20th century is otherwise Tomas Tranströmer (1931-2015).

It has two strings made of horsehair. The resonating cavity is usually covered with goat leather. Traditionally kobyzes were sacred instruments, owned by shamans and bakses (traditional spiritual medics). According to legends, the kobyz and its music could banish evil spirits, sicknesses and death.  In Kazakh music  In the 1930s, when the first folk instrument orchestras were established in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, a new kind of kobyz came into existence. It now had four metallic strings and thus became closer to a violin. Such a modernized kobyz can be used to play both Kazakh music and the most complicated works of violin literature. One of the few western musicians to use the kobyz is Trefor Goronwy.  In Tatar music  Tatar qylqubız The art of kobyz flourished before the fall of the Kazan khanate in 1552 among Tatars and some other ethnic groups of Volga region. However, this art was preserved until the end of the 18th century among the Tatar dervishes. Today the instrument is being used in different Tatar ethnic ensembles like Bermenchek etc. and it is studied in depth by a candidate of art history at the Kazan Conservatory .  In Kyrgyz music  Som note (reverse side) depicting a kyl kyyak (right) The kyl kyyak (Kyrgyz: кыл кыяк ) (sometimes spelt kyl kiak and sometimes without the 'kyl') is a stringed musical instrument used in Kyrgyz music. The instrument is carved from a single piece of wood (typically apricot) and typically measures 60–70 cm. It has 2 strings, one to provide melody and the other resonance. The kyl kyyak is played vertically with a bow and can be played on horseback. The strings and bow are normally made from horse hair and many instruments feature a carved horse's head. This all reflects the importance of the horse in Kyrgyz rural culture.  History  Bowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia, an example being the Kobyz (Kazakh: қобыз) or kyl-kobyz is an ancient Turkic, Kazakh string instrument or Mongolian instrument Morin huur:Turkic and Mongolian horsemen from Inner Asia were probably the world’s earliest fiddlers. Their two-stringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings, played with horsehair bows, and often feature a carved horse’s head at the end of the neck. ... The violins, violas, and cellos we play today, and whose bows are still strung with horsehair, are a legacy of the nomads.[3] It is believed that these instruments eventually spread to China, India, the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East, where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in China, the rebab in the Middle East, the lyra in the Byzantine Empire and the esraj in India. The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th-Century Northern Italy, where the port towns of Venice and Genoa maintained extensive ties to central Asia through the trade routes of the silk road. The modern European violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments from the Middle East[4] the Byzantine Empire.[5][6] It is most likely that the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments: the rebec, in use since the 10th century (itself derived from the Byzantine lyra[7] and the Arabic rebab), the Renaissance fiddle, and the lira da braccio[8] (derived[5] from the Byzantine lira). One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, was in the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556.[9] By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe.

Gopalakrishnan, a.k.a. MSG, (10 June 1931 – 3 January 2013) was a violinist in the field of Carnatic music. He is commonly grouped with Lalgudi Jayaraman and T.N.Krishnan as part of the violin-trinity of Carnatic Music. He was awarded the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1997.

He learned both systems from his father, with whom he gave his first performance when he was 8 years old. He also drew great inspiration from the legendary violinist Sri Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu. He has played the violin for over fifty years as a soloist and accompanist, having accompanied Omkarnath Thakur and D. V.

Vyšná Jablonka is a village and municipality in Humenné District in the Prešov Region of north-east Slovakia.  History  Vyšná Jablonka (Вышня Яблiнка) (Felsőalmád) is a village in Slovakia, in the Humenne district. First time it was mentioned in the \\"List of property\\" of the Lords of Humenne in 1436. From the beginning it was a foresters' village, what appeared until the present day. The fourth period mayor of the village is Emília Čopaková. From the nearly 700 inhabitants (1828 – 91 houses; 678 inhabitants) only 50 are now having their living place in Vysna Jablonka. Once there used to be also a watermill, that you can nowadays see at the exposition of folk architecture of the Hummen museum.  Second World War in Vysna Jablonka  When the partisans withdrew, only two snipers, Šuhajda and Jacko remained. A short time afterwards, a German tank battalion came through the village and stampeded some horses. The two snipers went to catch them. While doing that they found four German rangers, who were unprepared, as they were full of bravado because of the tank battalion. After capturing the Germans, an important piece of information was found out from the feldwebel Otto Vilnes (one of the captured German soldiers), who said that the 82nd division will take the positions at the Low Beskyds on the 26th of December, with the mission to hold the line until the new and fresh 254th infantry division will come. The Partisan Brigade \\"Sergej\\" decided to hold the line from the 82nd division group until the arrival of the Red Army. On the 26th of December the Germans crossed Vysna Jablonka and at the \\"Lukovsky Slip\\" they were defeated by the Partisans.  Orthodox Church  The village's first Orthodox church was probably built in the 16th century. It definitely existed in the 17th century, since the first record about the church is from the year 1623, written by the resident priest. In folk tales, it is said that he stayed in the Potok slum. The present-day church is located in the lower part of the village, at the western hill. Its construction is dated to the year 1766. In the landlord records from Hummene it was first mentioned in 1880. In the year 1998, the church went to the Greek Catholic Church. The orthodox votaries had to have their masses in one room at the local municipal office. Through the efforts of Empress Maria Theresa, the Orthodox in this area became united with Rome with the Union of Uzhorod in 1646. Any church built in this village would have been Greek Catholic, not Orthodox. The church remained Greek Catholic until the Communists outlawed the Greek Catholic Church and forced Orthodoxy on the people. The 1869 Census of County Zemplen (Administrative Records of the County Zemplen, Archive 2 of the County Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen) showed that there were 65 households in the village. One was Jewish, and if I remember correctly, one was Roman Catholic, all of the rest were Greek Catholic. In 1869 there were no Orthodox households or individuals in Vysna Jablonka. One Roman Catholic is correct. He was my maternal great grandfather. He came from Poland with his daughter and mother- in-law and joined the Greek Catholic Church.  Geography  The village is in the northeast of Slovakia among the Low Beskyds of the Laborec Highlands. It is situated close to the river Rieka which is 3 km (ca. 1.4 miles) away. The municipality lies at an altitude of 385 metres and covers an area of 24,832 km². The settlement has the highest elevation in the Humenne district. The next biggest cities being Humenne, Snina and Medzilaborce, 32 km, 25 km and 24 km away, respectively.  Flora & fauna  The village lies in the northern territories of Slovakia. The population of animals depends on the situation. There is a population of wolves (canis lupus), brown bears (ursus arctos), foxes and lynx. They hunt the local deer...

Shaw began her singing career in the 1960s and is still singing today. Her music has often been sampled in hip hop music, and used in television commercials. Early life Marlena Shaw was born on September 22, 1942 in New Rochelle, New York. She was first introduced to music by her uncle Jimmy Burgess, a jazz trumpet player. In an interview with The New York Times, she told the reporter “He [Jimmy Burgess] introduced me to good music through records - Dizzy [Gillespie], Miles [Davis], a lot of gospel things, and Al Hibbler, who really knows how to phrase a song.” In 1952, Burgess brought her on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to sing with his band. Shaw's mother did not want Marlena to go on tour with her uncle at such a young age. Shaw enrolled in the New York State Teachers College in Potsdam (now known as the State University of New York at Potsdam) to study music but she later dropped out.  Career  Shaw began to make singing appearances in jazz clubs whenever she could spare the time. The most notable of these appearances was in 1963 when she worked with jazz trumpeter Howard McGhee. She was supposed to play at the Newport Jazz Festival with McGhee and his band, but left the group after getting into an argument with one of the band members. Later that year, she got an audition with Columbia label talent scout John Hammond. Shaw did not perform well during the audition because she was too nervous. Undeterred, she continued to play small clubs until 1966. Her career took off in 1966 when she landed a gig with the Playboy Club chain in Chicago. It was through this gig that she met with representatives of the Chess Records music label, and soon signed with them. She released her first two albums on their subsidiary Cadet Records. A 1969 album track \\"California Soul\\", a funk-soul tune written by Ashford & Simpson and originally issued as a single by American pop quintet The 5th Dimension, later became a staple of the UK rare groove scene. This song has appeared in television commercials for Dockers, KFC and Dodge Ram trucks.2014 Dodge Ram 1500 Ad - YouTube Video Unable to find her own style at Chess, she moved to the jazz-oriented Blue Note Records in 1972. In 1977 she released an LP Sweet Beginnings on Columbia that contained, arguably, Shaw's finest moment: Yu Ma /Go Away Little Boy, a medley containing the old Goffin and Carole King standard, originally recorded by Nancy Wilson. The album also contained the track Look At Me, Look At You, popular on the U.K. rare groove scene. She sings the theme song \\"Don't Ask to Stay Until Tomorrow\\" from the 1977 film Looking for Mr. Goodbar that's also found on its soundtrack. She also recorded one of the disco era's biggest hits, a remake of \\"Touch Me in the Morning\\", also on Columbia Records. In 1982 Marlena recorded the Gary Taylor ballad called \\"Without You In My Life\\" from the LP Let Me In Your Life that was jointly produced by Johnny Bristol and Webster Lewis on South Bay records. This had moderate chart success in the USA. In 1983 she recorded the vocals for \\"Could It Be You\\", a track by Phil Upchurch on his Name Of The Game album. Shaw still performs and records today. In 1999, 2001 and again in 2007, Shaw was one of the performers at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Marlena Shaw among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He has been the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge since 1991. His research interests include political theology, ecumenical theology, Christian theologians and theologies, theology and poetry, the shaping of universities and of the field of theology and religious studies within universities, hermeneutics, and inter-faith theology and relations. He is the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme and a co-founder of the Society for Scriptural Reasoning. Early life and education Ford was raised as an Anglican in the Church of Ireland in Dublin. His father died when he was 12 years old and he was raised by his mother, Phyllis Mary Elizabeth Ford. For his undergraduate education, he studied at Trinity College Dublin, where he was active in politics, debate and journalism. He was elected a Scholar in classics in 1968. After completing his degree, he interviewed for jobs at British Steel Corporation and Rolls-Royce, but then was offered a scholarship to St John's College at the University of Cambridge and decided to study theology for a few years before going into business. He earned his bachelor's degree in theology at Cambridge and went on to earn his Master of Sacred Theology degree at Yale Divinity School; he also did graduate work at the University of Tübingen. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge, writing his dissertation on Karl Barth and biblical narrative under the direction of Donald MacKinnon and Stephen Sykes. The result was the book Barth and God's Story (1981). Ford later received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Birmingham. Career From 1976–1991 Ford was a lecturer (later senior lecturer) at the University of Birmingham. Living in the inner city, his theology was shaped by a multi-faith experience, and he also became involved in a local Anglican church in the evangelical tradition. As his housemate was involved in renovating derelict houses, he lived in some of those houses and became a house manager for one of them. In the university's theology department, he became close to theologian Daniel W. Hardy and went on to marry Hardy's daughter. In 1991 he moved to Cambridge to become the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. He is the first professor in this post who is not in the Anglican ministry. He helped found and chairs the management committee of the Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies at Cambridge. He is a member of St John's College, a fellow of Selwyn College, and a foundation member of Trinity College. He is highly regarded for his scholarship, is a sought-after lecturer and preacher, and serves as an advisor to the bishops of the Anglican Communion. His books have met with wide appeal; his The Modern Theologians: An Introduction to Christian Theology in the Twentieth Century (Blackwell, 1997), now in its third printing, is the leading textbook on modern Christian theology in the English-speaking world, China and Korea. His Theology: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 1999), part of the Very Short Introductions series, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Romanian, and Kurdish. =Multi-faith and inter- faith work= When Ford came to Cambridge in 1991, the theology department focused almost exclusively on Christianity. Ford assisted in the realisation of a development plan which included a new building, a new Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies, new endowed research posts, and the development of the Cambridge Theological Federation (the university's consortium of Anglican, Methodist, and United Reformed seminaries). The university went on to add two new posts in Islamic studies, a new post in New Testament, and a new endowed post in theology and natural science. A Roman Catholic institute and institute for Orthodox Christian theology were added to the consortium of seminaries. The Centre for Jewish-Christian Relations was established in 1998, followed by the Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations in 2006. Ford was introduced to interfaith dialogue in the early 1990s while on sabbatical at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, where his father-in-law, Hardy, director of the centre, introduced him to Jewish theologian Peter Ochs. Hardy and Ford participated in meetings of the early \\"textual reasoning\\" group founded by Ochs at the American Academy of Religion, reading the Tanakh, Bible, and Quran together with Christian and Muslim scholars. In 1996 Ford, Hardy and Ochs founded the Society for Scriptural Reasoning; Ford has been an active promoter of scriptural reasoning in subsequent papers and lectures. In 2002 Ford became the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme. Among his activities are lectures at international conferences on Muslim-Christian relations. In October 2007 he helped launch a letter by 138 Muslim scholars to 25 Christian leaders, including the Pope, the Orthodox Patriarchs, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the heads of the world alliances of the Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist and Reformed churches, calling for peace and reconciliation between Christians and Muslims for the survival of the world. The following month, he was one of the signatories on a Christian response seeking Muslim forgiveness. In 2008 the Sternberg Foundation awarded Ford its Gold Medal for Inter-Faith Relations. In November 2012 he was awarded the Coventry International Prize for Peace and Reconciliation (http://coventrypeaceprize.org.uk/) Memberships Ford is active both within the university and in public life. He has been a trustee for the Center of Theological Inquiry at Princeton since 2007 and a member of the board of advisors for the John Templeton Foundation since 2008. Other professional memberships include the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature. He is an editorial board member of Modern Theology, the Scottish Journal of Theology, Teaching Theology and Religion, the Irish Theological Quarterly, and the Journal of Anglican Studies. He is an editorial advisory board member for the Current Issues in Theology series published by Cambridge University Press. From 2003 to 2008 Ford was an academic member of the World Economic Forum Council of 100 Leaders for West- Islamic World Dialogue. He is an external advisor for the Centre for Christian Studies in Hong Kong (since 2006), a trustee for the Golden Web Foundation, a developer of a global multimedia publishing system with a focus on pre-modern world history, heritage and culture (since 2006), and a consultant for L'Arche Communities, a federation of over 100 communities for people with severe mental disabilities (since 1993). In 2011 he was one of 1,750 signatories to a letter to US President Barack Obama urging US intervention in the Libyan civil war. Personal He is married to Rev. Deborah Ford, daughter of the late Daniel W. Hardy. She is an assistant chaplain at Addenbrooke's Hospital, part of the Cambridge University Hospital system.

Miniature from a 15th-century manuscript of the De mulieribus claris by Giovanni Boccaccio Faltonia Betitia Proba (c. AD 306/315 – c. 353/366) was a Latin Roman Christian poet, perhaps the earliest female Christian poet whose work survives. A member of one of the most influential aristocratic families, she composed the Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi, a cento composed with verses by Virgil re-ordered to form an epic poem centred on the life of Jesus. Life Proba belonged to an influential family of the 4th century, the Petronii Probi. Her father was Petronius Probianus, Roman consul in 322, while her mother was probably called Demetria.Fassina.

The bond between Proba and this church might be related to Saint Anastasia, who probably belonged to the gens Anicia: Proba and Celsinus could have received the honour of being buried ad sanctos (next to the tomb of a saint), because of the particular veneration of the Anicii for this saint.Lizzi Testa. With her husband she owned the Horti Aciliorum at Rome, on the Pincian Hill.Samuel Ball Platner, \\"Horti Aciliorum\\", A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Oxford University Press, 1929. Works Two poems are attributed to \\"Proba\\", and only one is extant. Most modern scholars identify Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of these works, with the other possible identification being her niece Anicia Faltonia Proba.Green 1995, p. 551. = Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium = The first poem, now lost, is called Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium (The War of Constantine against Magnentius) by the Codex Mutinensis. It dealt with the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius. Proba was involved to this war through her husband Clodius Celsinus Adelphus, who had been praefectus urbi of Rome in 351, that the same year Italy passed from the sphere of influence of Magnetius to Constantius after the Battle of Mursa Major. The existence of this first poem is based on the first verses of the second poem. Here Proba rejects her first Pagan composition, and scholars think that the Pagan poem was destroyed according to her will.Jane Stevenson, Women Latin Poets, Oxford University Press, 2005, , p. 65. = Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi = Proba's most famous work is a Virgilian centoa patchwork of verses extracted from several works of Virgil, with minimal modificationsentitled Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi (A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ). The 694 lines are divided into a proemium with invocation (lines 1-55), episodes from the Old Testament (lines 56-345), episodes from the New Testament (lines 346-688), and an epilogue (lines 689-694).

Institutional membership in the association currently stands at 113 universities. All member institutions have graduate programs in space sciences or technology. Besides the 98 member institutions in the United States, there are two member institutions in Canada, four in Europe, two in Israel, one in Australia and one in New Zealand, one in Hong Kong, two in Korea and two in the United Kingdom. The History of USRAaccessdate = 2006-10-31publisher = USRA archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024001501/http://www.usra.edu/about/intro.shtml archivedate = 2006-10-24}} Objective USRA provides a mechanism through which universities can cooperate effectively with one another, with the government, and with other organizations to further space science and technology, and to promote education in these areas. Its mission is carried out through the institutes, centers, divisions, and programs. Administrative and scientific personnel now number about 420. A unique feature of USRA's management is its system of standing panels of technical experts, drawn from the research community, to provide oversight for USRA's institutes, centers, divisions and programs. Origin USRA was founded in 1969, at NASA’s request, under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences. Just prior to the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the return of the lunar samples, NASA sought a new partner organization to engage and organize the research community. James Webb, NASA Administrator, wrote to President Frederick Seitz, proposing a university association, chartered to advance space science and technology. The result: the formation of USRA. Webb envisioned this new association as not only working with NASA in lunar science, but also in other scientific disciplines and technology areas, in which NASA would become engaged, as its space exploration role unfolded. As the civilian space program grew to encompass missions in heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, Earth science, microgravity science, and other disciplines, as well as technology development, USRA worked alongside NASA. All the efforts under taken by USRA from its founding to the present day fulfil its non-profit purpose and also realize Webb’s vision of close partnership and engagement of universities. USRA’s first task: operation of the Lunar Science Institute and engaging the scientific community in the analysis of lunar samples that would be returned to Earth during the Apollo missions. Now called the Lunar and Planetary Institute, the LPI cultivated strong collaboration between NASA and the international research community to help organize a new research discipline: lunar and planetary science. The LPI helped lead research that resulted in a new understanding about the origin of the Moon. Today, the LPI, located in USRA’s facility near NASA’s Johnson Space Center, continues the important job of organizing community activities to support NASA’s exploration of our solar system, with a specialized scientific and administrative staff. Charter On March 1, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced the creation of the Lunar Science Institute (LSI), and USRA was chartered the following year as the parent organization of LSI. The initial headquarters of USRA was at the University of Virginia, where Professor A. R. Kuhlthau served as the first president of the association. In 1976, Dr. Alexander J. Dessler became the second USRA president. Dessler moved the headquarters of the association to Rice University, where he served as chairman of the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy. In 1978 USRA headquarters moved to Columbia, Maryland. Dr. David C. Black was appointed USRA president in 2000. Black served as director of USRA's Lunar and Planetary Institute from 1988 to 2001, and is internationally recognized for research in theoretical astrophysics and planetary science. Dr. Jeffrey Isaacson was named president and CEO of USRA, effective October 20, 2014. Other programs USRA initially concentrated on the management of Lunar Science Institute (later renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute) but, armed with its broad charter, the consortium began to explore other ways to serve the university space research community as early as 1970. Today, USRA researchers are involved with university, government and industry scientists and engineers in a broad array of space and aeronautics related fields, including astronomy and astrophysics, earth sciences, microgravity, life sciences, space technology, computer science, and advanced concepts. Most USRA research activities include related educational components. The presidents of USRA have been: * A. Robert Kuhlthau (1969–1976) * Alexander J. Dessler (1976–1981) * Paul J. Coleman, Jr. (1981–2000) * David C. Black (2000–2006) * Frederick A.

He is a supporter of President Hassan Rouhani and was a critic of former Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He officially visited Egypt in 2010. Controversy Nateq-Nouri was at the center of an international dispute in 2009 after he referred to Bahrain as Iran's 14th province. Bahrain paused negotiations with Iran regarding gas imports in response, and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf condemned the remarks. The Iranian foreign minister immediately commented on the controversy and stated that Nateq-Nouri's remarks about the history of Bahrain had been misinterpreted by the media and that Iran respected Bahrain's sovereignty. Nateq-Nouri himself told Al Jazeera that his remarks about the history of the region had been misunderstood and that his comment was not relevant to today's Iran-Bahrain relationship.

Although similar to the SA the car had a wider track at the rear allowing a larger body to be fitted. The car used a tuned version of the six-cylinder Morris QPHG engine enlarged to 2561 cc. The compression ratio was increased to 7.25 to 1 and a new balanced crankshaft was fitted. Drive was to the live rear axle via a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three ratios and a divided propshaft. Wire wheels were fitted and the 14 inch drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system. The saloon body was made in-house by Morris and was a spacious four-door with traditional MG grille flanked by two large chrome plated headlights. It can be distinguished from the outwardly similar SA by the front bumper which has a dip in the centre and the spare wheel was carried on the front wing as opposed to the boot lid. Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat with folding centre arm rest at the rear, all with leather covering and a return was made to the traditional octagonal framed instruments.

Their tails are slender, with a well-developed caudal fin and two triangular dorsal fins.McGrouther, M. (2006): Eastern Fiddler Ray, Trygonorrhina faciata . Australian Museum. Their snouts are translucent. The fiddler rays are also distinguished from other guitarfishes in that the anterior nasal flaps of their nostrils are expanded backwards and fused together into a nasal curtain that reaches the mouth. Fiddler rays feed on bottoms shellfish, crabs, and worms, which they crush between their jaws. The eastern fiddler ray is known to scavenge from fish traps. Like other guitarfishes, fiddler rays are ovoviviparous. The egg capsules of the southern fiddler ray are reported to be golden in colour, containing three embryos each. It gives birth to litters of four to six young per breeding cycle. Fiddler rays are harmless and easily approached by divers. Southern fiddler rays are taken as bycatch by commercial trawlers and by recreational fishers; the flesh is of good quality and sold in small quantities.

Chavannes was a prolific and influential scholar, and was one of the most accomplished Sinologists of the modern era notwithstanding his relatively early death at age 52 in 1918. A successor of 19th century French sinologists Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat and Stanislas Julien, Chavannes was largely responsible for the development of Sinology and Chinese scholarship into a respected field in the realm of French science. Life and career Édouard Chavannes was born on 5 October 1865 in Lyon, France. As a youth he studied at the lycée in Lyon, where, like most students of his era, his education focused mainly on the Latin and Greek Classics. Chavannes was then sent to Paris to attend the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he and his classmates studied and prepared for the entrance exams to one of the French Grandes Écoles. Chavannes passed his entrance exams and was admitted to the Lettres (\\"literature\\") section of the École Normale Supérieure in 1885. Chavannes spent three years at the school, finishing in 1888 after successfully passing his agrégation in philosophy. Georges Perrot, a French archaeologist and newly appointed director of the École Normale Supérieure, advised Chavannes to begin studying China after he finished his schooling. Chavannes first considered studying Chinese philosophy, which was nearer to his own educational background, but on the advice of the French scholar Henri Cordier he ultimately decided to focus on Chinese history, which up to that time had been much less widely studied in the West. Chavannes began attending Classical Chinese courses given by the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys at the Collège de France and the Mandarin Chinese classes of Maurice Jametel (1856-1889) at the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages). Desiring to advance his studies with actual experience in China, Chavannes used the connections of certain friends of his to obtain a position as an attaché to a scientific mission associated with the French Legation in Peking (modern Beijing). He departed for China in January 1889 and arrived two months later.Cordier (1917): 115. As a sinologist, Chavannes took the Chinese name Sha Wan (沙畹) and the courtesy name Zilan (滋蘭), and he also had an art name Shicheng Boshi (獅城博士, \\"The Doctor of Lyon\\").。Shicheng(獅城), which is literature meaning City of lion, it is coming from the meaning of Lyon in French. Chavannes and his wife, Alice Dor, during trip to Japan (c. 1892) In 1891, Chavannes briefly returned to France where he married Alice Dor, the daughter of a well-known optometrist in Lyon, before returning to China with her.Cordier (1917): 116. Together they had a son, Fernand Henri Chavannes, who later became a highly decorated flying ace during World War I, and two daughters.de la Vallée Poussin (1918): 147. Chavannes stayed in China until 1893, when he returned to France to take up the position of Professor of Chinese at the Collège de France, which had been vacated upon the death of the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys in November 1892. Although Chavannes had only been studying Chinese for five years, the quality and value of his early Chinese scholarship had already been widely recognized in the academic community, and convinced the regents of the Collège de France to give the position to him. Chavannes opened his tenure with a lecture entitled \\"Du Rôle social de la littérature chinoise\\" (\\"On the Social Role of Chinese Literature\\"). During his tenure at the Collège, Chavannes was widely active in French academic circles: he was a member of the Institut de France, was an honorary member of a number of foreign societies, served as a French co-editor of the noted sinological journal T'oung Pao from 1904 until 1916, and was elected President of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1915. Chavannes's granddaughter Claire Chavannes had a son with physicist Paul Langevin's grandson Bernard Langevin: the french mathematician Remi Langevin. Scholarship Chavannes (c. 1905) =History= Chavannes' first scholarly publication, \\"Le Traité sur les sacrifices Fong et Chan de Se-ma Ts'ien, traduit en français\\" (\\"Sima Qian's Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices, Translated into French\\"), which was published in 1890 while he was in Beijing, inspired him to begin a translation of Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji 史記), the first of China's dynastic histories. The first volume of the translation was published in Paris in 1895, and begins with a 249-page introduction which the German anthropologist Berthold Laufer described as \\"a masterpiece of historical and critical analysis... not surpassed by anything of this character written before or after him.\\" Chavannes produced four additional volumes between 1896 and 1905, covering 47 of the 130 chapters of the Records and complete with full commentary and indices. His translations also include a large number of appendices covering topics of special interests. =Epigraphy= Chavannes was major pioneer in the field of modern epigraphy, and was praised by Berthold Laufer as \\"the first European scholar who approached this difficult subject with sound and critical methods and undisputed success.\\" His first epigraphical article, \\"Les Inscriptions des Ts'in\\" (\\"Qin Inscriptions\\"), was published in Journal Asiatique in 1893, which was followed later by a number of works in which Chavannes was the first Western scholar to successfully analyze and translate the unusual epigraphical style of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty. Chavannes returned to China in 1907 to study ancient monuments and inscriptions, taking hundreds of photographs and rubbings that were published in 1909 in a large album entitled Mission archéologique dans la Chine septentrionale (Archaeological Mission to Northern China). He published two volumes of translations and analysis of the inscription material before his death: La Sculpture à l'époque des Han (Sculpture in the Han Era), published in 1913, and La Sculpture bouddhique (Buddhist Sculpture), published in 1915. =Religion= Chavannes was intrigued by and performed extensive research into the major religions of ancient and medieval China: Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Daoism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manichaeism. His Mémoire composé à l'époque de la grande dynastie T'ang sur les religieux éminents qui allèrent chercher la loi dans les pays d'occident par I-Tsing (Memoir Written in the Grand Tang Dynasty by Yijing on the Religious Men Who Went to Search for the Law in the Western Lands), which was published in 1894 and won the Prix Julien, contains translations of the biographies and travelogues of sixty Buddhist monks who journeyed from China to India during the Tang dynasty in search of Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit books. Chavannes' best-known work on Chinese Buddhism is his three-volume work Cinq cents contes et apologues extraits du Tripiṭaka chinois (Five Hundred Tales and Fables from the Chinese Tripiṭaka). Chavannes' 1910 book Le T'ai Chan, essai de monographie d'un culte chinois (Tai Shan: Monographic Essay on a Chinese Cult), is a detailed study of the indigenous Chinese folk religion, which predates Buddhism and religious Daoism, and focuses on an ancient mountain cult centered on Mt. Tai that Chavannes visited personally. This monumental work begins with introductory essays on the generally sacred role of mountains in Chinese history and culture, then examines the personality of Mt. Tai itself in great detail. Chavannes includes translations of dozens of relevant passages from ancient, medieval, and pre-modern Chinese literature, including comments and passages gathered by medieval scholars Zhu Xi and Gu Yanwu. His study also includes eleven translations from rubbings of stone inscriptions Chavannes made himself in temples he visited on and around Mt. Tai, as well as a detailed hand-drawn topographic map of the mountain that Chavannes drew himself. Chavannes' style in Le T'ai Chan, with his annotated translations, extensive commentary, and exhaustively researched sources was inspirational and influential to later French sinologists. In 1912, Chavannes and his former student Paul Pelliot edited and translated a Chinese Manichaean treatise that Pelliot had discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Mogao caves. The book, published in Paris as Un traité manichéen retrouvé en Chine (A Manichaean Treatise Found in China), was praised by Berthold Laufer upon Chavannes' death in 1918 as \\"perhaps the most brilliant achievement in modern sinology.\\" Selected works * Chavannes, Édouard (1890). \\"Le Traité sur les sacrifices Fong et Chan de Se-ma Ts'ien, traduit en français\\" (\\"Sima Qian's Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices, Translated into French\\").

Written by bass guitarist John Archer, keyboardist Geoffrey Crosby, drummer Douglas Falconer, trumpet player Jack Howard, recorder/mixing engineer Robert Miles, vocalist/lead guitarist Mark Seymour and trombone player Michael Waters. The song captures the intensity of sensual love at the same time portraying its fleeting nature with lyrics including \\"And we may never meet again, So shed your skin and let's get started\\". In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \\"Ozzest 100\\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \\"Throw Your Arms Around Me\\" was ranked number 19. Background Hunters & Collectors had formed in 1981 with Mark Seymour (guitar, vocals), John Archer (bass guitar), Doug Falconer (drums) Geoff Crosby (keyboards), Greg Perano (percussion), Ray Tosti-Guerra (guitar), and Robert Miles, their sound engineer and art director. Miles was credited as an equal part of the band's output and stayed with the band throughout their career. Tosti-Guerra was later replaced by Martin Lubran, then by Barry Palmer. Seymour is the older brother of bassist Nick Seymour of Crowded House. Hunters & Collectors signed to White Label, an offshoot of Mushroom Records, and by 1985 the line-up was Seymour, Archer, Falconer, Crosby and Miles with Jack Howard on trumpet and Michael Waters on trombone. They recorded the first version of \\"Throw Your Arms Around Me\\" for a single-only release in 1984, with \\"Unbeliever\\" as its B-side; all members were credited as the songs' writers. A live version of \\"Throw Your Arms Around Me\\" appeared on their 1985 album The Way to Go Out. Their breakthrough commercial success in Australia came in 1986, with the release of the album Human Frailty, which featured another recording of the single \\"Throw Your Arms Around Me\\", as well as \\"Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Everything's on Fire\\". In 1990 a slower, more acoustically introspective version of the single was recorded and released from their compilation album Collected Works.

Mark Seymour described writing for Human Frailty: Cover versions A shortened version was performed by Crowded House (a band whose members include Mark Seymour's brother Nick) at their Farewell To The World concert in 1996, and was also earlier covered by the band on MTV Unplugged. The song has also been covered by Australian musical comedy act, Tripod, famous for their work on the Triple J radio Australian network. The song was later covered by Pearl Jam, with the lyric \\"I will kiss you in four places\\" changed to \\"I will kiss you in 155 places\\" by vocalist Eddie Vedder. Neil Finn attributes this change to Vedder's having heard one of Crowded House's many cover versions of the song before hearing the original.Farewell to the World band commentary track Finn typically changes the number each time he performs it. The comic trio Doug Anthony All Stars performed acoustic versions of this song at many of their performances, and recorded a promotional CD.

This Romantic aesthetic term is not a geographic category, but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists. Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning, it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features, though on a much smaller scale, that might remind a visitor of Switzerland.  Rock outcrops  The Bastei, Saxon Switzerland Rock of Oëtre, Norman Switzerland The original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe, the bulk of them German-speaking, as well as to other parts of the world, to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out, usually amid steep forest. The original, 18th-century comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the Jura Mountains on the Franco-Swiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres. Histories of Saxon Switzerland (Sächsische Schweiz) in Saxony, Germany, assert that the landscape description schweiz arose there at the end of the 18th century. Schweiz is the German-language name of Switzerland. The term was used both alone and with the prefix \\"little\\", for example in the title of an 1820 German book-length poem, Die kleine Schweiz by Jakob Reiselsberger,Reiselsberger, Jakob; Die kleine Schweiz oder Einladung zur Reise nach Streitberg, Muggendorf, Weischenfeld [et]c. und deren Umgebungen; Leitfaden für hieher Reisende, Höhlen-Besucher, Natur- und Alterthums-Freunde, und schön unterhaltendes Taschenbuch für jedermann; [S.l.] 1820 which praised the rocky scenery of a part of Franconia in Germany known thereafter as the Franconian Switzerland (Fränkische Schweiz). The term was already colloquial by this time in English: in 1823 a correspondent asserted in The Gentleman's Magazine that a steep area by the road outside Petersfield in southern England was a little Switzerland.The Gentleman's Magazine, London; December 1823, page 506 The aesthetic term, to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude, was also in common use in other European languages, including the French term Suisse. Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in Romantic painting. The many English places praised in 19th-century promotional literature as \\"little Switzerland\\" include Church Stretton, Whitfield and the coastal area around the North Devon twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth. Chalet-style buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions, for example at Matlock Bath, which (unusually for England) also features a cable car.  Mountains  From the beginning, the term was often understood as a comparison to the snow-capped Alps rather than to the Jura. The following passage, describing Wales, appears in an 1831 English-language edition of Malte-Brun's Universal Geography, which had originally been written in French in 1803–07: Describing the Atlantic island of St Helena in A New Voyage Round the World (1823–26), Otto von Kotzebue and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz were translated into English as writing: In the United States, the raw White Mountains of New Hampshire, which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic painting, were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832.Tudor, Henry; Narrative of a Tour in North America; London, James Duncan, 1834, page 390  Lakelands  Lake Plön in Holstein Switzerland In the later 19th century, authors and tourism promoters would praise picture-postcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or schweiz. Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers, this was a term for beauty. This usage, reflected today in the official geographical terms for the Holstein Switzerland (Holsteinische Schweiz) and Mecklenburg Switzerland (Mecklenburgische Schweiz) in Germany, where there are neither mountains nor outcrops, is difficult to account for, but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich, Lucerne or Interlaken or to Lakes Geneva and Constance.  Official names  The term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable. By the 21st century, it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the \\"little Switzerland\\" label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande, or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces. In 1992, the Swiss Tourism Federation counted more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland, either because of a fancied scenic resemblance, in jest or referring to a banking haven, political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants. No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names. While the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places, it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including (with dates of legal designation): * Bohemian Switzerland (České Švýcarsko, nature park, Czech Republic, legislation with effect 2000)http://www.ceskesvycarsko.cz/bohemian- switzerland-national-park * Bremen Switzerland (undulating geest north of Bremen, that reaches 30 m; c.f. the flat land on which Bremen is built.) * Franconian Switzerland (tourism region, Germany, designated 1968) * Hersbruck Switzerland (Hersbrucker Schweiz), low mountain region around Hersbruck, Germany * Hohburg Switzerland (Hohburger Schweiz), alternative name for the Hohburg Hills near Leipzig * Holstein Switzerland (nature park, Germany, formed by association 1986) * Kashubian Switzerland (Szwajcaria Kaszubska, Poland) * Kroppach Switzerland, rocky upland region near Kroppach in the Westerwald * Marcher Switzerland (Märkische Schweiz, nature park, Germany, by decree 1990) * Mecklenburg Switzerland (nature park, Germany, designated 1997) * Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland (protected landscape and recreation area in Rhineland-Palatinate). * Rostock Switzerland (rugged terminal moraine landscape near the Baltic coast in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). * Rüdigsdorf Switzerland (hill range and karst landscape in the southern Harz, most of which is a nature reserve) * Ruppin Switzerland (a forested lakeland in Brandenburg) * Saxon Switzerland (nature park, Germany, designated 1990; local government area, now in Saxon Switzerland-East Ore Mountains district) Business promotion regions using the name without legally defined boundaries include: * Suisse Normande (upland region of Calvados, France) * Little Switzerland (Luxembourg) (dolomite formations near Echternach, Luxembourg) Notable privately developed properties known by the name include: * Little Switzerland, North Carolina (resort development on hilltop in North Carolina, USA, from 1909) * Little Switzerland (Wisconsin) (a ski resort from 1941 onwards)  Usage  In English, \\"Little Switzerland\\" is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective, but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation, e.g. North Carolina's Little Switzerland. In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article, little Switzerlands do likewise. Their English names may echo the vernacular, being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet, sometimes taking an English definite article, e.g. the Saechsische Schweiz (die Sächsische Schweiz) and the Suisse Normande (la Suisse normande). English forms are also widespread, e.g. Holstein Switzerland (Dickinson, 1964), Swiss Franconia (Michelin, 1993),Germany, Michelin Tourist Guide, 1st Edition, 1993, Clermont-Ferrand, p 59.

This battle is sometimes confused with the later Battle of Rovine (lit. \\"Battle of the Marshes\\", Rovine is old Romanian-Latin for ruins, modern Italian rovinare to tear down) between the same combatants, and which took place also along the valley of the Argeş River. Background The Ottoman Empire emerged as a small principality in the early fourteenth century in the northwestern part of the Anatolian Peninsula. In the following decades, the Ottoman sultans combined their growing military strength with astute dynastic politics to expand their territory eastwards into the whole of Anatolia and westwards into the Balkan Peninsula. Thus, in 1387 Murad I (1362–89) conquered much of Greece and fought a large Christian army at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. In the early 1390s his successor Bayezid I (1389–1402) established his suzerainty over Stefan Lazarević of Serbia, the Turnovo Bulgaria of Ivan Shishman, and the Vidin Despotate of Ivan Sratsimir. The Ottoman Empire had become one of the most important powers in the Balkans, threatening the remaining independent states of central Europe: Wallachia, Moldavia, the Kingdom of Hungary, as well as the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea. Mircea of Wallachia previously secured an alliance with several Karamanid princes of Anatolia, which antagonized Bayezid I. Yet Bayezid despite defeating the Karamanids, had to plan and act every action carefully, since he had more enemies than friends among the Muslim Turkish aristocracy, and could not simply turn around and declare a new \\"holy war\\" against those whose troops helped the Karamanid princes in Anatolia. His opportunity came when the Wallachians and the Hungarians invaded the weak states from the south of the Danube, which were vassals of Bayezid. The Wallachians occupied the Principality of Karvuna and the city of Silistra apparently with the consent of Ivan Shishman, while the Hungarians tried to conquer the Vidin Despotate. These infringements on his vassals' lands gave Bayezid authority to move. Returning from Asia Minor to the Balkans in 1393, the Sultan expelled the Wallachians from Silistra and the Dobruja, and declared that Turnovo Tsardom, unable to fend for herself, was now an Ottoman pashalik. The final attack on Wallachia was to take place. The battle In the autumn of 1394, after a raiding campaign along the right bank of the Danube, Bayezid launched the attack on Wallachia. He commanded the Ottoman Rumelian army, and the armies of his Balkan vassals, most of which were Bulgarians and Serbs under Stefan Lazarević, the son of the late Serbian prince Lazar. The armies crossed the Danube at Nicopolis, and advanced along the Argeş River with the intention of capturing Curtea de Argeş, the capital city of Wallachia. After a weeklong march in which the constant Wallachian attacks took their toll, the Wallachian army met the Ottomans on October 10. The Wallachians launched a sudden ambush from the forests, slowly pushing the Ottomans closer to the bank of the Argeş River.M. Dogaru The bloodiest fighting took place around the Ottoman camp, strengthened with earth walls, palisades, and ditches (hendek in Turkish). Hence, the name with which this battle appears in Serbian chronicles, as the Battle of the Trenches (of Karanovasa). Surrounded, the Ottomans managed to resist until dawn, when Bayiezid barely managed to escape the battle, fleeing over the Danube Nevertheless, most of his and his vassals’ armies perished. Aftermath It would turn out that his vassals suffered more from the Sultans \\"help\\" than they did from the Wallachians and Hungarians. The Turnovo Tsardom not only ceased its existence, but Ivan Shishman was accused of collaboration with the enemy and was executed at the orders of the Sultan. Bayezid spent the winter and the spring warring in Anatolia with Seljuk princes, besieging Constantinople, and leaving the lands south of the Danube in the hands of Mircea, who by now managed to provoke an anti-Ottoman rebellion as far south as Rumelia. A much better prepared attack, in which the entire Ottoman army, as well as the whole of the Ottoman vassals took part, was started by the Sultan in spring, in May 1395. The alliance documents signed at Brașov on March 7, between Mircea and Sigismund of Luxembourg, reveal that by 1395, a huge concentration of Ottoman forces took place in the southern Dobruja. The Ottoman army launched a two-pronged attack via Nicopolis, and Vidin-Craiova. Another Ottoman army group, led by Vlad I of Wallachia, Mircea's nephew, who was attempting to take the throne with Turkish support, was invading along the Ialomiţa River. Faced with a much larger force, Mircea applied guerrilla tactics, and delayed direct confrontation with the Ottoman army until he received help from his ally Sigismund. The final confrontation would take place at the Battle of Rovine (lit. \\"Battle of the Marshes\\").

It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. It covers in McCormick County and Edgefield County, and was established to protect rare animal and plant species. Webster's Salamander and Miccosukee gooseberry are among the species which have few populations outside the preserve. The nearest population center is Clarks Hill, about two road miles (3–4 km) to the southwest. The site was identified in 1957 by Albert E. Radford of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He noticed exceptional diversity in the tree, shrub and herb layers on the bluffs overlooking Steven's Creek, and documented six plant species which had been unknown in South Carolina up to that time. Another five species were known from only one other South Carolina location. Many of these rare species were plentiful at the site, and remain prominent there today. A remarkable feature of this plant community is that a palmetto, Sabal minor, occurs near northern inland wildflowers such as Asarum canadense. Four trillium species are also present.Radford, Albert E. A Relict Plant Community in South Carolina. Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Society 75 (1959). pp. 33-34 Soils of the bluffs were found to be atypical for South Carolina. Most of the state's soils are acidic with pH near or below 5.Soil Data, psu.edu However, some topsoils in the preserve had pH readings near 7 -- neutral on the scale. This is more typical of base-rich sites in Appalachian coves and the Midwest, where many plants rare to South Carolina are abundant. These soils correspond most closely to the Cartecay and Toccoa series which are loam or sandy loam-textured Entisols. Along Steven's Creek are alluvial silt loam Inceptisols of the Riverview series. Web Soil Survey The majority of the preserve, away from the bluffs, is underlain by acidic sandy loam Ultisols of the Cataula, Hiwassee, Louisburg, and Pacolet series typical of the South Carolina Piedmont. These upland soils support mixed pine and hardwood forest over most of the preserve except in the southwest corner which has pure stands of pine.

While Enchiritos were removed from the menu in 2013, they can still be requested when ordering. Enchirito () is the trademarked name of Taco Bell's menu item of the Tex-Mex food similar to an enchilada. It is composed of a flour tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef taco meat (with options to substitute steak or chicken), beans, diced onions, cheddar cheese, and \\"red sauce\\". History There is an unsubstantiated claim that the Enchirito was invented in 1967 by a high school student in Montebello, CA.LA Times food Section dated July 1968,Montebello News, and Montebelo News, Whittier Daily News in the food Sections and local news. However, a 2008 article published in the Long Beach Press-Telegram claimed that a Cerritos, California, franchise owner named Dan Jones had created the Enchirito. In an article published in a Corsicana Daily Sun in 1971, there is a third claim that a Taco Bell franchise owner in Texas was the actual inventor. Alternate Link via NewspaperArchive.com. The original Enchirito of the 1970s was advertised as a special tortilla filled with ground beef, pinto beans, and onions; topped with red sauce, cheese and olives. It was served in a reheatable aluminum foil tray. Alternate Link via NewspaperArchive.com. Alternate Link via NewspaperArchive.com. One of the earliest print references to the Enchirito is an August 1967 Taco Bell ad in an Amarillo, Texas, newspaper for a meal consisting of a taco, Enchirito, and soft drink for $0.89. Alternate Link via NewspaperArchive.com. Taco Bell registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a service mark in May 1970. In its application, Taco Bell described the item as a [ Combination Enchilada And Burrito Prepared As Part Of ] Restaurant Services and that \\"Enchirito\\" Is Merely A Fanciful Combination Of \\"Enchilada\\" And \\"Burrito.\\" Name The coining of the name Enchirito (a portmanteau of the words enchilada and burrito) for this item was a bit of a peculiar action by Taco Bell. It was the only item on the menu, at the time, to not use the common Mexican food nomenclature for that item. Whereas a burrito is typically a flour tortilla filled with beans, and an enchilada is typically a corn tortilla filled with meat and smothered in chile sauce, the name Enchirito communicates the combination of these elements. On the other hand, it appears the unusual name was not to help Americans unfamiliar with the Spanish names of the food items; indeed, for many years Taco Bell menu boards featured a system of phonetic pronunciation guides next to each item. Reappearance Even after the Enchirito was officially discontinued in 1993, some customers still ordered them, and word spread through the Internet that many restaurants would still make them with the ingredients they had available. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Due to this underground popularity, it was decided to bring it back, and commercials, featuring the Taco Bell chihuahua promoting the Enchirito, began airing on December 26, 1999, with later commercials in mid-2000 featuring the rapping or singing styles of the \\"five guys with no talent\\". However, some things about the item had changed. The serving container had become a coated pressed-paper oblong bowl when dining in, or a black plastic bowl with a clear plastic lid if ordering from the drive-thru. Most significantly, the character of the dish was altered by changing the yellow corn masa tortilla to a white wheat flour tortilla. The sliced olives were omitted. The chicken Enchirito and the steak Enchirito, which respectively substitute chicken or steak for the ground beef, were also introduced as options. The Enchirito is served with a plastic spork. The Enchirito was once again discontinued when Taco Bell introduced the Smothered Burrito on July 25, 2013. While it may not be currently seen on the menu, it can be requested when ordering. A typical ground beef enchirito contains 209 calories, 17 grams of fat (8 grams saturated), 45 milligrams cholesterol, and 1110 milligrams of sodium.

Constructed in the Kerala style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, who is worshipped as Parthasarathy (Partha's charioteer). The nearest railway station to the temple is located in Chengannur, while the nearest airport is Trivandrum International Airport. Parthasarathy is the other name of Krishna on account of his role as Arjuna's Charioteer in the Mahabharata war. It is one of the most important Krishna temples in Kerala, the others being at Guruvayur Temple, Trichambaram Temple, Tiruvarppu and Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple. It is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata, where the five Pandavas are believed to have built one temple each; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple to Sahadeva. The sacred jewels, called Thiruvabharanam of Ayyappan are taken in procession to Sabarimala each year from Pandalam, and Aranmula Temple is one of the stops on the way. Also, the Thanka Anki, golden attire of Ayyappa, donated by the king of Travancore, is stored here and taken to Sabarimala during the Mandala season of late December. Aranmula is also known for snake boat race held every year during Onam linked to the legends of the Mahabharata. The temple has four towers over its entrances on its outer wall. The Eastern tower is accessed through a flight of 18 steps and the Northern tower entrance flight through 57 steps leads to the Pampa River. It is believed that Dushasana is the guardian of the eastern Gopuram of the temple. The temples has paintings on its walls dating back to early 18 century. The temple is open from 4 am to 11:00 am and 5 pm to 8 pm and is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board of the Government of Kerala. Legend It is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata. Legend has it that the Pandava princes, after crowning Parikshit as king of Hastinapura left on a pilgrimage. On arriving on the banks of river Pamba, each one is believed to have installed a tutelary image of Krishna; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple to Sahadeva.Cultural Heritage of Kerala 2008, pp. 44-45Rao 2012, pp. 17-20 The image of the temple was brought here in a raft made of six pieces of bamboo to this site, and hence the name \\"Aranmula\\" (six pieces of bamboo). There is another story, which says it was brought in a raft made of seven pieces of bamboo, out of which one got separated at a place 2 kms upstream of the current Temple's location on the banks of Pamba. The place is called \\"Mulavoor Kadavu\\" meaning \\"river bank where the bamboo pole came off\\". There are still descendants of a family of Ayurveda physicians with great lineage by that name Mulavoor residing there. As per other legend, the place derives its name from arin-villai, a land near a river. Legend has it that Arjuna built this temple, to expiate for the sin of having killed Karna on the battlefield, against the dharma of killing an unarmed enemy. It is also believed that Vishnu (here) revealed the knowledge of creation to Brahma, from whom the Madhukaitapa demons stole the Vedas. There is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here. During the battle of Kurukshetra, Duryodhana had taunted Bheeshma of not using his full might in fighting the Pandavas. This taunt by Duryodhana filled Bheeshma with rage. Bheeshma took a vow to fight with such ferocity the next day that Lord Krishna himself would be forced to break his vow of not using a weapon during the war in order to protect Arjuna. On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma, when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe. Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught. Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshma's bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour. The string of Arjuna's bow, the Gandiva was snapped during the battle. Seeing Arjuna's plight, Krishna jumped down in rage, and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma. Bheeshma was overfilled with joy and surrendered to Lord Krishna. Meanwhile, Arjuna beseeched the Lord not to kill Bheeshma, as it would have been against Krishna's vow to take up arms in his battle. It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here, with a discus. This symbolizes the Lord's act of compassion to both his devotees on either side of the battle. Lord Krishna broke his vow to protect Arjuna and also to fulfill the promise that his ardent devotee Bheeshma had made. Lord Krishna presiding here in the Vishvarupa form is considered as \\"Annadana Prabhu\\" (The Lord who provides food) along with other temples like Vaikom Mahadeva Temple and Sabarimala. It is believed that those whose Annaprashana is performed at the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple would never be affected by the pangs of poverty throughout their life. Aranmula Mirror is also related to the history of this temple. The king of Travancore wanted to donate a crown made of rare metal to the temple and he found a rare combination of copper and lead. It is believed as per the tradition that preparing the metal polished mirror was produced only by a family. In modern times, the College of Fine Arts have started producing it on commercial scale.Cultural Heritage of Kerala 2008, p. 159 Architecture The outer walls around the sanctum housing the structure of lamps, called Vilakkumaadam The temple is built in Kerala style architecture, which is common in all temples in the South Indian state of Kerala in eastern axis. The temple has an elevated structure reached by a flight of 20 steps. The temple has a two-storeyed gopuram or a gateway tower, with the upper storey having wooden trails covering the Kottupura (a hall of drum beating during festivals). A rectangular wall around the temple, called Kshetra-Madilluka, pierced by the gateways, encloses all the shrines of the temple. The metal plated flagpost or Dwajasthambam is located axial to the temple tower leading to the central sanctum and there is a Deepastamba, which is the light post. Chuttuambalam is the outer pavilion within the temple walls. The central shrine and the associated hall is located in a rectangular structure called Nallambalam, which has pillared halls and corridors.Rao 2012, pp. 12-13 Between the entrance of Nalambalam to the sanctum, there is a raised square platform called Namaskara Mandapa which has a pyramidal roof. Thevrapura, the kitchen used to cook offering to the deity is located on the left of Namaskara Mandapa from the entrance. Balithara is an altar is used for making ritualistic offering to demi-gods and the festive deities. The central shrine called Sreekovil houses the image of the presiding deity, who is a standing four-armed Lord Vishnu worshipped as Parthasarathy. It is on an elevated platform with a single door reached through a flight of five steps. Either sides of the doors have images of guardian deities called Dvarapalakas. As per Kerala rituals, only the main priest called Thantri and the second priest called Melshanthi alone can enter the Sree Kovil.Cultural Heritage of Kerala 2008, p. 139 The central shrine has a circular plan with the base built of granite, superstructure built of laterite and conical roof made of terracotta tile supported from inside by a wooden structure. The lower half of Sree Kovil consists of the basement, the pillar or the wall, called stambha or ' and the entablature called ' in the ratio 1:2:1, in height. Similarly the upper half is divided into the neck called griva, the roof tower called shikhara and the conical kalasam (made of copper) in the same ratio. The roof projects in two levels to protect the inner structure from heavy rains during monsoon. The roof of the temple and some of the pillars have lavish wood and stucco carvings depicting various stories of ancient epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha. The outer walls around the sanctum have a series of wooden frames housing an array of lamps, which are lit during festive occasions. The temples have paintings on its walls dating back to early 18 century.Cultural Heritage of Kerala 2008, p. 151 The image of the presiding deity is tall, making it the tallest among the idols of all Krishna temples in Kerala. Krishna is in Vishvarupa pose, the one he depicted to Arjuna during the Mahabharatha war. It is thus considered to be in fierce form. As per one legend, Arjuna is believed to have built the temple in Nilakal Narayanapuram and later brought to Aranmula in a raft made with six bamboo. In the second precinct, there are shrines of Sastha, Yakshi, Nagaraja and Erangavil Bhagavathy Balarama in the lower shrine. Aranmula Temple Utsavam The annual Utsavam commences on the Atham Nakshatra in the month of Makara and concludes ten days later on the Thiruvonam day. Garuda Vahanam Ezhunellippu is the main event during this ten day festival. This event falls on the fifth day of the annual festival and is also called Anchaam Purappadu. The deity is taken out from the sanctum sanctorum mounted on Garuda. It is believed that all 33 million Devas (the elements of nature) and Gandharvas would be present in the temple at that time to witness Lord Krishna riding on his vahana, the Garuda. Other Festivities Aranmula Uthrattathi Boat Race As per Hindu legend in Mahabharata, Arjuna, one of the Pandavas was returning with the image of Krishna after along penance. He faced a huge flood in the Pamba river. A poor low caste Hindu helped him cross the river with a raft made with six bamboos. It is believed that the Aranmula Boat Race is celebrated annually on the Pamba river to commemorate the poor Hindu. The race is held on the last day of the Onam festival when snake boats around with four helmsmen, 100 rowers and 25 singers participate. The boats move in pairs to the rhythm of music. After the watersport, there is an elaborate feast in the Aranmula temple. The festival is the largest boat race festival held in Kerala and is attended by thousands of visitors. The festival was largely a religious one until 1978, when the Government of Kerala declared it a sports event, but during 2000, the religious festivities were restored. The Malayalam month of Meenam witnesses a festival where Aranmula Parthasarathy is taken in a grand procession on the Garuda mount to the Pampa river bank, where an image of the Bhagawati from the nearby Punnamthode temple is brought in procession for the Arattu festival. Another festival celebrated here is the Khandavanadahanam celebrated in the Malayalam month of Dhanus. For this festival, a replica of a forest is created in front of the temple with dried plants, leaves and twigs. This bonfire is lit, symbolic of the Khandavana forest fire of the Mahabharata. The heads of three Brahmin households in Aranmula and nearby Nedumprayar follow a tradition of fasting on Thiruvonam. The tradition reportedly dates back to more than two centuries. It is believed that once a Brahmin made a vow to feed one pilgrim everyday. Pleased with his devotion, the presiding deity appeared to him. From then on, the Brahmin was overjoyed and he made it a custom to feed to conduct a feast every year, which is practised in modern times. The feast is conducted after the boat race. Religious importance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Kulasekhara Alvar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Thirumangai Alvar have sung in praise of the perumal in this temple with eleven Pasurams, numbered at 2843-53. Thulabaram, the practice of weighing oneself against material and donating it to the temple is practiced here. The Vanni tree in the temple is believed to have medicinal values. The fruits of the Vanni tree are also weighed in Thulabaram and also used for curing diseases of the devotees. It is the place where Brahma is believed to have worshiped Vishnu to retrieve the Vedas from the two demons named Madhu and Kaitibha. The image of Parthasarathy is believed to have been installed by Arjuna himself. The temple is used to store the jewels of the Sabarimala temple. Temple administration The temple is open from 4 am to 11:00 am and 5 pm to 8 pm and is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board of the Government of Kerala. The king of Travancore maintained the golden dress in the temple, offered to Sabarimala Ayyapan Temple. The practise of offering the golden dress to Sabarimala temple annually is done by the board.

The company evolved from The Greyhound Corporation, which established Greyhound Lines and later became a diversified conglomerate between the 1960s and the 1990s. History Viad Corp was founded in 1926 as Motor Transit Corporation after intercity bus operators Eric Wickman and Orville Caesar joined forces and consolidated several bus operations. By 1930, more than 100 bus lines had been consolidated and recognizing the need for a more memorable name, the company was renamed The Greyhound Corporation. The Greyhound name had its origins in the inaugural run of a bus route from Superior, Wisconsin, to Wausau, Wisconsin. While passing through a small town, Ed Stone, the route's operator, saw the reflection of his bus in a store window. The reflection reminded him of a greyhound and he adopted that name for that segment of the Blue Goose Lines. The Greyhound name became popular and was applied to the entire bus network as well as the parent company.Lewis, Mary Beth. \\"Ten Best First Facts\\", in Car and Driver, 1/88, p.92. Wickman retired as president of Greyhound in 1946 and was succeeded by Caesar. Wickman died at the age of 66 in 1954. Caesar died on May 19, 1965, a day before his 75th birthday. In 1954, Greyhound established Greyhound Financial Corporation, the captive finance operation of the bus line. During the 1960s, Greyhound began its transformation into a conglomerate by diversifying into other industries: financial services (Travelers Express); food and consumer products (Armour and Company); food service (Prophet Company); restaurants (Horne's); airport services (Aircraft Services International); and ocean cruises (Premier Cruise Line). Greyhound exited the transportation industry with the sale of Greyhound Lines in 1987. By then, The Dial Corporation (formerly, Armour-Dial, Inc., established in 1967 as a subsidiary of Armour and Company) was its largest subsidiary. Greyhound was renamed Greyhound Dial Corporation in 1990 and as The Dial Corp the following year. After the renaming, the Dial consumer business became known as The Dial Corp Consumer Products Group. The company exited the financial services industry in 1992 with the sale of GFC Financial Corporation (including Greyhound Financial Corporation, Greyhound European Financial Group and Verex Corporation). In 1995, GFC Financial Corporation changed its name to The FINOVA Group, Inc. and Greyhound Financial Corporation to FINOVA Capital Corporation. The FINOVA Group filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and was dissolved in 2009. In 1996, the company announced the splitting of its businesses into two entities. The Dial consumer products business was spun-off as the new Dial Corporation. After the split, the company was renamed Viad Corp and consisted of companies involved in airline catering (Dobbs International Service); airplane fueling and ground handling (Aircraft Service International); convention and exhibit services (GES Exposition Services and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur); concession operations (Glacier Park, Inc.); contract food services (Restaura, Inc.); ocean cruises (Premier Cruise Lines); airport and cruise ship duty-free concessions (Greyhound Leisure Services); travel services (Brewster Transport, Jetsave, and Crystal Holidays); and payment services (Travelers Express). By early 21st century, most of the businesses were sold except for Travelers Express, Glacier Park, GES Exposition Services, and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur. In 2003, Viad began the process of engineering a reverse tax-free spinoff of Travelers Express. Thus, a new subsidiary was formed, MoneyGram International, Inc., which early in 2004 received the payment services business and its stock was distributed to Viad stockholders. Viad then conducted a one-for-four reverse stock split to increase the price of Viad shares. Businesses Viad Corp currently consists of two business units: GES (an international live-event organizer) and Pursuit (travel attractions and hotels). * GES (Global Experience Specialists, Inc., formerly GES Exposition Services, Inc.) is an international live-event organizer created in 2010 by merging GES Exposition Services, Inc., Exhibitgroup/Giltspur, and Becker Group. * Pursuit (formed in 2017) includes travel attractions and hotels in and around Banff, Denali, Glacier, Jasper, Kenai Fjords, and Waterton Lakes National Parks in Canada and the United States. =Pursuit= Properties that Pursuit operates under its Glacier Park Collection include: * Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish * Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier * St. Mary Lodge and Resort in St. Mary * Stewart Hotel near Lake McDonald Lodge * Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton, Alberta Between 1981 and 2013, Glacier Park Inc. was also the concessionaire for Lake McDonald Lodge, Apgar Village Inn, Rising Sun Auto Camp, Swiftcurrent Inn, Many Glacier Hotel, Two Medicine Camp Store, and the red bus tours within Glacier National Park. The National Park Service awarded this concession to Xanterra starting in 2014. Glacier Park Inc. said the concessions contract accounted for about 40 percent of its business in the Waterton-Glacier area. In 2012, Pursuit acquired the 162-room Banff International Hotel. Pursuit also operates other Banff and Jasper area attractions under the Brewster Travel Canada brand, including Banff’s 133-room Mount Royal Hotel, Jasper National Park's 32-room Glacier View Lodge, Banff Lake Cruises and the Banff Gondola. In late December 2016, the Mount Royal Hotel suffered fire damage. An outdoor equipment store within the hotel reopened in April 2017, while the rest of the hotel was scheduled to reopen in July 2018.

He died in March 2012. Restoration of Babs Babs, in 2005 His most famous restoration project, which received worldwide attention, was to excavate and restore Babs, after 40 years buried on a tidal beach. \\"Babs\\" was the car that in 1927, driven by J.

In 1967 Wyn Owen decided to excavate and restore Babs. The car was first successfully tested on The Helyg straight in the early 1970s and was later successfully demonstrated in front of the world press and television on an air field near RAF Valley, Anglesey.

Founded in 2003, it has evolved into a 25,000 capacity 4-day event, showcasing predominantly live music (in particular alternative, indie, rock, folk, dance and Americana), with additional tents hosting literature, film, comedy, theatre and poetry. The festival site is divided into 10 areas. It is also possible to stay for a week on the campsite and do other activities. The festival has expanded into other ventures and also set up a charitable wing called the Green Man Trust. In 2018, headline acts including Fleet Foxes, The War on Drugs and Public Service Broadcasting. In 2019, headliners included Stereolab, Four Tet and Idles. Amongst acts announced for 2020 were Caribou, Goldfrapp, Michael Kiwanuka, Mac DeMarco and Little Dragon.  History  The Green Man Festival began as a small event in Hay-on-Wye in 2003. The first year was attended by 300 people, the second 400, and the third 800. Fiona Stewart then became managing director and moved the festival to its current location on the Glanusk Park estate near Crickhowell, in the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales. In 2012, the festival had a daily capacity of 10,000 people and the headline acts were Mogwai, Van Morrisson and Feist. By 2013, the festival had 20,000 visitors. It took place over 10 areas and it was possible to stay for a week with a settlers pass. The 2017 festival celebrated the event's 15th anniversary. In 2018, it had 25,000 visitors, with headline acts including Fleet Foxes, The War on Drugs and Public Service Broadcasting. Bands and DJs play a range of musical styles, including indie, Americana, folk, psychedelia, reggae, electro and stoner rock. In 2019, the headliners were Stereolab, Four Tet and Idles. Headline acts announced for 2020 were Caribou, Goldfrapp, Michael Kiwanuka, Mac DeMarco and Little Dragon. As well as music areas, the festival has a children zone, a science workshop called Einstein's Garden and tents for literature, film, theatre and comedy. Stewart said in 2015: \\"I really like people coming to the event and seeing them enjoy themselves. I mean I like hosting dinner parties, they’re not a chore, I think Green Man is the biggest dinner party I do.\\" The Green Man Festival refuses commercial sponsorship and therefore can focus on local Welsh food and drink providers, rather than being tied into corporate deals. It directly employs its workers, paying a living wage. The festival has a strong ethical and environmental focus, using solar power as much as possible. The food and drink services are required to meet standards such as being Fairtrade, Red Tractor and Marine Conservation Society accredited. In 2019, Help Refugees and Newport to Calais Aid Collective collected donated tents to be recycled and reused. The festival has never used single-use plastics and encourages caterers to use local produce.  Awards  Renowned for its non-corporate, ethical approach, the Green Man Festival has won several awards including \\"Best Medium Sized Festival 2010\\", and \\"Grass Roots Festival 2012\\".

Samlesbury Hall, a historic house, is in the village, as is Samlesbury Aerodrome and a large modern brewery owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. The population at the 2011 census was 1,206. History The village's name is derived from the Old English sceamol, meaning ledge and burh meaning fortification, hence literally \\"ledge fortification\\". It may also be that the name at least partly derives from the Roman name for the River Ribble and its eponymous Celtic deity, Belisama. In the 13th and 14th centuries, there was fortified house near the river, probably a stone tower, held by the Denyas family. It was destroyed by the Scots during The Great Raid of 1322. A family heiress, Alicia Denyas, married Gilbert de Southworth, builder of Samlesbury Hall. The parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974.Preston RD, Vision of Britain, accessed 9 June 2014 In 1974 the parish became part of South Ribble. Samlesbury Hall Samlesbury Hall Samlesbury Hall is a manor house built in 1325 which has been many things since then including a public house and girls' boarding school, but since 1925, when it was saved from being demolished for its timber, it has been administered by a registered charitable trust, the Samlesbury Hall Trust. This Grade I listed medieval manor house attracts more than 50,000 visitors each year. Religious buildings Samlesbury parish church Samlesbury parish church, like the one at nearby Walton-le-Dale, is dedicated to St. Leonard the Less and was founded in 1096. The church contains a Norman tub font, a medieval bell and Sir Thomas Southworth's funerary armour dating from 1546. It also has a church chest, a two-decker pulpit and a complete set of box pews dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. The Roman Catholic church is St Mary and St John Southworth. There was previously also a Wesleyan Methodist chapel. Education Samlesbury benefits from having its own primary school called Samlesbury Church of England Primary School. The school is located beside the Church of St Leonard the Less, on the banks of the River Ribble. Samlesbury witches The Samlesbury witches—Jane Southworth, Jennet Brierley and Ellen Brierley—were accused of child murder and cannibalism and tried at Lancaster Assizes on 19 August 1612, in the same series of trials as the Pendle witches. All three were found not guilty in a trial which one historian has described as \\"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\\". Samlesbury brewery Samlesbury brewery is a large modern brewery belonging to InBev. It was completed in 1972 to brew Heineken lager for Whitbread. It produces Boddington's Bitter, and bottled and keg Bass Pale Ale for export. Samlesbury Engineering Samlesbury Engineering was a subsidiary of the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation at Warton which was chaired by Sir Wavell Wakefield, later Lord Wakefield of Kendal. The company specialised in bus manufacturing but was capable of high-quality engineering. Their workshop, where the ill-fated Bluebird K7 was designed and built, was on the car park behind Samlesbury Hall. Bluebird K7 was the turbo jet-engined hydroplane in which Donald Campbell set seven world water speed records during the 1950s and in which he was killed on Coniston Water in 1967. The Lancashire Aircraft Corporation, together with Samlesbury Engineering, eventually became part of what is now BAE Systems, which today has a facility at BAE Samlesbury.

A significant number of artists and craftspeople live in the area. The Onekaka Hall Recreation Reserve is on the state highway opposite the Onekaka Iron Works Road and contains a community hall, stage and tennis court. The Mussel Inn hotel is a short distance along the highway. A large ironworks was in operation in Onekaka by 1924, with a tramline that connected it to a wharf. It produced pig iron and pipes from limonite, which was mined there, and the operation employed up to 150 men. A small hydroelectric plant was built in 1929 to provide electricity for the pipe manufacturing. The works could not compete with iron produced overseas and closed in 1935. From 1937 to 1944, the hydroelectric plant produced power for Golden Bay. The plant was restarted by hydro enthusiasts in 2003 and produces 3.5 gigawatt-hours annually for the national grid. A remnant of the wharf and tramline remains on Washbourn Road and is a listed historic place. The wharf was a recurring theme in the art of prominent New Zealand painter Doris Lusk.

Arrival in Canada Chartier de Lotbinière) Harwood, Seigneuresse de Vaudreuil; painted by Anson Dickinson c. 1824. Courtesy of McCord Museum Harwood was christened at Sheffield Cathedral, England, third son of William Harwood and Elizabeth Unwin. Representing William Harwood & Sons- his family's wholesale silver and hardware business in Sheffield that exported to Jamaica, Bermuda, Baltimore and Lower Canada -he came to Montreal in 1821. The obscure young merchant's fortunes were significantly improved when, two years later, he married Marie- Louise Josephte de Lotbinière (1803 - 1869), eldest daughter of Michel- Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière. Politics He was named to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada in 1832 and served until the Lower Canada Rebellion led to the dissolution of the council. He was a member of the Special Council from August 1839 until it was dissolved in 1841. After several unsuccessful attempts, in 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Vaudreuil; he resigned in 1860 to run (successfully) for a seat in the Legislative Council for Rigaud division. In 1853, Harwood helped found the Vaudreuil Railway Company. Seigneur de Vaudreuil Robert Unwin Harwood, 1824 Despite being an Englishman who had married into the right to be called a seigneur, Harwood was held in great respect by his tenants. Exchanging a life of society and business in Montreal, he and his wife arrived in Vaudreuil in 1829 to bring the estate back to order. Rather than relying on rents as an income he built a large scale co- operative mill to the great benefit of all those who lived on his land. He gave generously to churches, schools and the needy in Vaudreuil. He described his interest in pursuing reforms in agriculture and transportation as 'a hobby', but he displayed a firm grasp of the problems facing his tenants, and it revealed his genuine concern to improve things. When it came to collecting his seigneurial dues he preferred leniency to litigation, adding to the respect and admiration that his tenents held for him. His brother in England on the other hand berated him for his liberal attitude writing to him that 'the management of property to advantage is a talent not possessed by many, and certainly not by our family'. But the French-speaking newspaper La Minerve wrote at his death, Mr Harwood's conduct as a seigneur has been and remains irreproachable... Few seigneurs were as well liked by their censitaires as he was... The Hon. Robt. Harwood was much respected, indulgent to his tenantry, of unspotted reputation, courteous and considerate to all with whom he had relations Chateau Vaudreuil In 1830, Harwood rebuilt the old manor house at Vaudreuil where his wife had grown up, naming the new house 'Chateau Vaudreuil'. It was a large and imposing four storey, stone house on a hill, that burned down in 1870. After Harwood's death, when the Seigneurial system of New France had been abolished, his heirs sold the house and it subsequently became the College de St. Raphael before it was destroyed by fire. After the fire, under the foundation stone a leaden plate stamped with three fleurs de lys was found bearing the French inscription - (requires a source!) This stone was laid by Lady Louise Elyzabeth de Joybert, wife of the high and powerful Seigneur Philippe de Rigaud (Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil), Chevalier, Marquis de Vaudreuil, Grand Cross Order of Saint Louis, Governor and Lieutenant- General to the King of all of New France in 1723, the 15th of March. Lady Louise de Joybert was the daughter of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson and his wife Marie-Francoise (who died in Paris, 1732), the daughter of Louis-Théandre Chartier de Lotbinière, Mrs Harwood's great, great, great grandfather. Family In 1823, at Vaudreuil, Robert Unwin Harwood married Marie-Louise-Josephte Chartier de Lotbinière (1803–1869), the eldest daughter of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, and heiress to the Seigneury of Vaudreuil. Her mother, Mary Charlotte Munro, was a daughter of Captain The Hon. John Munro.

DTMB system is compatible with fixed reception (indoor and outdoor) and mobile digital terrestrial television. *Mobile reception: is compatible with digital broadcasting TV in standard definition (SD), digital audio broadcasting, multimedia broadcasting and data broadcasting service. *Fixed reception: in addition to the previous services, also supports high definition digital broadcasting (HDTV). =Modulation= The DTMB standard uses many advanced technologies to improve their performance, for example, a pseudo- random noise code (PN) as a guard interval that allows faster synchronization system and a more accurate channel estimation, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) for error correction, modulation Time Domain Synchronization - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) which allows the combination of broadcasting in SD, HD and multimedia services, etc. This system gives flexibility to the services offered to support the combination of single- frequency networks (SFN) and multi-frequency networks (MFN). The different modes and parameters can be chosen depending on the type of service and network's environment. The sequence of pseudo-random pattern is defined in time domain and the information of the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined in the frequency domain. The two frames are multiplexed in the time domain, resulting in Time domain synchronization (TDS). =Functional scheme= This transmission system makes the conversion of the input signal to the output data of terrestrial TV signal. The data passes through the encoder, the error protection process FEC (Forward Error Correction), through the constellation mapping process and then the interleaving processes the information to create the data blocks. The data block and the TPS information are multiplexed, and pass through the data processor to form the body structure. It combines information from the body and the head to form the frame and this is passed through the SRRC (Square Root Raised Cosine) filter to become a signal within an 8 MHz channel bandwidth. Finally the signal is modulated to put it in the corresponding frequency band. =Features= *Bit- rate: from 4.813 Mbit/s to 32.486 Mbit/s *Combination of SD, HD, and multimedia services *Flexibility of services *Time and frequency domain of data-processing *Broadcasting of between 6 and 15 SD channels and 1 or 2 HD channels *Same quality of reception as wire broadcast See also * CMMB * OFDM system comparison table * Media of China * Telecommunications in China * Telecommunications industry in China * Digital television in China (PRC) * Technical standards in Hong Kong * Digital terrestrial television * ATSC Standards- Advanced Television Systems Committee Standard * DVB-T - Digital Video Broadcasting—Terrestrial * ISDB-T International - Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting International References Further reading * External links *http://en.dtvstatus.net/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20100915102819/http://www.altera.com/support/refdesigns/sys- sol/broadcast/ref-dmb-t.html * IEEE Spectrum - Does China Have the Best Digital Television Standard on the Planet? * Information page of the standard on Standardization Administration of PRC site * Official announcement of intent to approve the standard on August 1, 2007 made by Standardization Administration of PRC * ChineseNewsNet report * CNet China report *Hong Kong Technical Standard for Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting *MING-T, Multistandard Integrated Network convergence for Global Mobile and Broadcast Technologies * Venezuela starts trials DTMB Category:Digital television Category:Science and technology in the People's Republic of China Category:Science and technology in Hong Kong ","title":"Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast"},{"id":"7708991","text":"Myrniong ()Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition (2005).

It houses the Royal Military School of Music, training musicians for the British Army, which acquired the building in the mid-19th century. It is also home to the school's Museum of Army Music. The Army is scheduled to vacate the site in 2020. History and architecture The first house on the site was built by Edmund Cooke between 1635 and 1646 and in 1664 was the fourth largest house in Twickenham. In 1709 the property was purchased by Sir Godfrey Kneller, court painter to British monarchs from Charles II to George I. He had the original house demolished and replaced by a new building, reputedly designed by Sir Christopher Wren. This second house was known as Whitton Hall, after the village, but was renamed by Kneller's widow, in memory of her husband. In 1757, the house was sold to Sir Samuel Prime, a prominent London lawyer, who, with his son of the same name, extended it significantly and landscaped the grounds. After Samuel Prime junior died in 1813, the hall was sold to Charles Calvert, Whig MP for Southwark from 1812 to 1832. He further expanded the house (to designs by Philip Hardwick), adding drawing rooms at the east and west ends of the building. Calvert died of cholera in 1832 and his widow inhabited until her death about 1845. The house was then acquired by the government as a teacher training college, but it needed substantial reconstruction. By 1850 much of the Wren bulk of the house had become dilapidated and so was demolished. The Hardwick additions were preserved to form the wings of the new house, designed by George Mair. This third building on the site, which still stands today, is stone-corniced, casemented and constructed as to its ground floor central range and otherwise built of red bricks, all in the neo-Jacobethan style suitable to 19th and 20th century mansions of its scale. It consists of 17 bays, the central of which is the widest and of stained glass and the two adjacent of which are arrow-slit windows. The bays are split into five recessed or projecting ranges. Two square, pavilion towers form the near left and right bays, each tower crowned by a stone and leaded ogee-shaped cupola. Its gatepiers and house are separately listed by Historic England at Grade II. Functions From 1850 to 1856 Kneller Hall served as a teacher training college under principal Frederick Temple and vice-principal Francis Turner Palgrave, known for his poetry anthology Palgrave's Golden Treasury. In exchange for a two-year college education almost entirely subsidised by the state – one of the first forms of state-sponsored social mobility – graduates of the college were supposed to teach pauper and delinquent boys in specially built district schools. Though Kneller Hall itself was generously funded by the state, the larger scheme to build district schools never came to fruition owing to political and religious conflict (see Newcastle Commission). The college closed when it was unable to attract any more students, who were now expected to teach in miserable conditions in Britain's workhouses. On 3 March 1857 the building was taken over by the War Office as the base for a school for army bandsmen; it then evolved into the Royal Military School of Music. During the Second World War the site was briefly the headquarters of the Commander-in- Chief, Home Forces from late 1939 until the headquarters moved out to St Paul's School in July 1940. On 18 January 2016 defence minister Mark Lancaster announced that Kneller Hall was one of 12 Ministry of Defence (MoD) sites proposed to be released as part of the MoD's drive for greater efficiency. In November 2016 the MoD announced that the site would close in 2020. This was later extended to 2021.  References  Further reading *Turner, Gordon & Turner, Alwyn W.

He played hurling with his local club Clonad and was a member of the Laois senior inter-county team from the 1930s until the 1950s. Ruschitzko captained Laois in their last All-Ireland final appearance in 1949. Biography Patrick Ruschitzko, Ruschitzko was brought up in Muine Bheag, County Carlow, where his mother brought the family on the death of her husband. Ruschitzko was educated locally, however, the family later moved to Mountmellick, County Laois. It was here that his hurling skills were first noted. Ruschitzko, however, later emigrated to England for a period. On his return he joined the staff of Irish Worsted Mills in Portlaoise. He ended up as manager of the mills and remained there until the firm's closure in 1973. He married Lillian Dunne and had three children, two girls and one boy who died at a very young age. Paddy Ruschitzko died 4 March 2004. Playing career =Club= With his club, Clonad, Ruschitzko won over 20 major honours and was part of the three-in-a-row team that won the Laois Senior Hurling Championship in 1946, ‘47 and ‘48. =Inter-county= Having moved to live in Mountmellick, he starred on the Laois minor team which was denied All- Ireland Minor Hurling Championship glory in 1934 in the final, which Tipperary won by one point after a long period of injury time. In 1949, Paddy was captain of the Laois team which won the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. Playing at left half back he marked the legendary Jimmy Langton and Laois scored a shock 4–5 to 2–7 win over a powerful Kilkenny team. In the All- Ireland semi-final, Laois defeated Galway 4–6 to 3–5, leaving Paddy to lead out his team in the All-Ireland final parade opposite his old school colleague, Pat Stakelum, who was captain of the Tipperary team. Tipperary ran out easy winners but Ruschitzko's place in Gaelic Athletic Association history is secure as Laois haven't won a Leinster title since.

Political career He first stood for parliament in 1910, contesting Hull Central, a seat that the Conservatives had held in the 1906 Liberal landslide. Though it was not a promising seat, he did very well, coming to within 20 votes of defeating the incumbent. A third opportunity came to contest Hull Central at a by-election. His Conservative opponent had been unseated on petition. However he was again unsuccessful. He was Chairman of the Hull and District Liberal Federation.Chairman of the Hull and District Liberal Federation He did not contest Hull Central again and did not stand for parliament again until 1923.

Aske regained the seat at the 1929 general election, and held it until the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election. When the Liberal Party split in 1931 over participation in Ramsay MacDonald's Conservative-dominated National Government, Aske was one those who broke away to form the new National Liberal Party, which merged in 1948 with the Conservatives.

The two largest municipalities, however, adopted waste-diverting policies at a very different pace. Edmonton began a pilot project in curbside recycling for single-family houses in 1986 and adopted it citywide in 1988, expanding over the years to include more items (Christmas trees in 1990, and construction waste in 2008), and higher levels of processing including large-scale composting and capturing methane to produce energy. In addition, the scope of collection has expanded to include multifamily buildings in 2001 and businesses in 2010.

In 2014, the recycling/composting rate for municipal solid waste in the US was 34.6%. A number of U.S. states, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or landfill bans of recyclable materials. National legislation collection center for recyclables in Santa Monica, California, USA On a national level, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees a variety of waste issues under the mandate of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. These include regulation of hazardous wastes, landfill regulations, and setting recycling goals. The Department of Commerce is also responsible for helping to develop markets for recycled goods. State and local legislation More specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments. State regulation falls into two major categories: landfill bans and recycling goals. Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill. Most often these items include yard waste, oil, and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs. States with landfill bans of recyclables include Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,Report from Minnesota comparing area states landfill laws http://www.wasteresources.wi.gov/docview.asp?docid=5954&locid;=83 and North Carolina.NC Division of Waste Management - Solid Waste Program Other states focus on recycling goals. These include California and Illinois. One way in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of a bottle bill. A number of U.S. states, such as California, Hawaii, Oregon, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Iowa, Michigan, and New York have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling. Most are five cents per can or bottle. Michigan's has maintained a 10 cent deposit value for bottles and cans since 1976.http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_LCC_bottbill_32030_7.pdf = Mandatory recycling = Some cities, such as Seattle, and states like Connecticut, have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away a certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste. Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials, food and yard waste, and wood. There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law. Disposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households, businesses and apartments. For businesses, that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard, paper, and yard waste in the garbage. For apartments and houses, disposal of glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited. With businesses and apartments, if garbage collectors find more than 10 percent of the container filled with recyclables, they will leave a tag. On the third tag, the business or apartment tenants will receive a $50 fine. However, households do not face the risk of being fined. If trash collectors find over 10 percent of their garbage contains recyclables, they will leave a tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week. =Criticism of mandatory recycling= In a 1996 article in The New York Times, John Tierney claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves. Tierney's article received a referenced critique from the Environmental Defense Fund, which noted that \\"the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by a group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or a vested financial interest in opposing it\\". In 2003, Daniel K. Benjamin (a professor of economics at Clemson University) published a paper through the Property and Environment Research Center that reiterated many of the points brought up in the New York Times article, backing them up with a detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the US. In 2010, he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the US, finding that not much has changed. Financial implications When the recycling industry was in its infancy in the United States, the financial costs of collecting, depositing, and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal. Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill disposal. For example, recycling efforts in New York City cost $57 million per year in 2002Logomasini, A.(2002) Forced Recycling Is a Waste The Wall Street Journal, March 19 and by 2015 it cost the city $300 more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill. To refute this argument, people pointed out that the social benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost. Landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources, contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested, and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways. The long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration. However, in many regions of the country, there are now economic incentives to recycle. As early as 2003, Fort Worth Texas was making $1,000,000 from their recycling program.Recycling Made Easy and Profitable. National Recycling Coalition. http://www.nrc- recycle.org/philinquirerarticleonrecycling.aspx Similarly, Waukesha County's recycling program in Wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in 2004.Waukesha County Materials Recycling Facility Report. http://www.waukeshacounty.gov/uploadedFiles/Media/PDF/Parks_and_Land_Use/Recycling/Reports_and_Charts/MRF%20budget%20book%20charts_landfills.pdf Most recently, Waukesha County began receiving a $6.50 per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private MRF (Materials Recycling Facility). Combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the long-term costs incurred if the items had been landfilled, the average total lost revenue (county's share) for recyclables thrown in the landfill is $112.50.Newsletter 2008 http://www.ci.waukesha.wi.us/Engineering/Documents/newsletterMay2008recycle.pdf  Recycling status  = Recycling statistics = Recycling materials waiting to be barged away on the Chicago River Trash and recycle bin at George Bush Intercontinental Airport Recycling statistics (ca. 2014) with similar numbers as of 2015 *An average of approximately 258 million tons of trash is generated by the United States in 2014 **34.6% was recycled **12.8% was combusted for energy recovery **52.6% was landfilled * of trash is generated per capita per day in the United States  Recyclables in the landfill  The New York Times reported in May 2018 that in some cases, 25% of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill. Contamination can occur from unwashed plastics and greasy cardboard or paper items. If materials are not clean they are sent to landfills. =Recycling by material type= Recycling rates vary by material and product type. *64.7% of Paper *33.0% of Steel *26.0% of Glass *19.8% of Aluminum *9.5% of Plastics E-waste Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution. Electronic scrap components, such as CPUs, contain potentially harmful components such as lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated flame retardants. Recycling and disposal of e-waste may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes.: Sthiannopkao S, Wong MH. (2012) Handling e-waste in developed and developing countries: Initiatives, practices, and consequences. Sci Total Environ. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling because,\\"Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture. Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials.\\" Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher. Tires The Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million scrap tires were generated in 2003.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Management of Scrap Tires. 3 January 2007. 14 February 2007 http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/tires/index.htm Of the 290 million, 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire re-treads.Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Recycling tires. 9 August 2005. 26 February 2007 http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/recycling/awareness/facts/tires/ In 2017, 287 million were generated, 38 million reused and 249 million scrapped. With landfills minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires, many new markets have been created for scrap tires. Growing markets exist for a majority of scrap tires produced every year, supported by state and local government. Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products. Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. As of 2017, 40 states banned whole tires from landfills, 38 allowed shredded tires, 24 allowed processed tires in mono- fills. Fees are collected by 37 states. In 2017, 81.4% of scrapped tires were marketed for some beneficial use, down from 87.9% in 2015. Of the 3,411 thousand tons of marketed scrap tires, 50.8% were used as fuel, 29.6% as ground rubber. Of the tires used as fuel, 46% were consumed in cement kilns, 29% in pulp and paper mills and 25% in electric utility boilers. The United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from about 1 billion in 1992, down to 60 million tires in 2017, primarily due to state scrap management programs. Most of the remaining stockpiles are in Colorado and Texas. ;Local government US state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states. Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires: source of funding for the program; licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers, processors, and end users; manifests for scrap tire shipments; limitations on who may handle scrap tires; financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers; and market development activities.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Management of Scrap Tires. 3 January 2007. 14 February 2007 http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non- hw/muncpl/tires.org Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire. These fees, sometimes called “tipping fees”, help to support recycling costs. When the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high, this, in turn, discourages landfill disposal, a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs. Chinese recycling industry restrictions For most of the early twenty-first century, China was the main destination for the world's scrap material. This resulted from a combination of factors, including the growing need for metal, paper and plastics in China's expanding industry, lax environmental regulations, cheap labor, and inexpensive shipping using containers that would otherwise be returned to China empty. In the United States, this resulted in a strong market for many scrap commodities and allowed local recycling programs to come close to breaking even economically or even to turn a small profit. That situation abruptly changed in 2017 when China announced its ‘’’National Sword’’’ program which banned many scrap imports and imposed strict quality standards on others, starting in February 2018. Acceptable limits for contamination in imported waste were cut from 5-10 percent to 0.5 percent. Since then almost no plastic scrap has been exported to China from the United States and shipments of metal and paper scrap have been sharply reduced. Scrap plastic imports dropped from 3.5 million metric tons in 2017 to 21,300 metric tons in the first half of 2018.Could The Chinese National Sword Inspire Global Recycling Innovation? July 6, 2018, Tom Eng, TOMRA As a result, scrap prices in the US have plummeted. The US recycling industry is responding by investing in better sorting equipment to attempt to meet the National Sword standards and by developing new market for waste materials both within the US and in other countries, including Southeast Asia and India. However several countries in Southeast Asia have announced their own restrictions on recycling. Early history The first post- World War II mass recycling program in the United States, \\"Ban The Can,\\" was conceived and executed in 1970 by Ruth \\"Pat\\" Webb in Honolulu, Hawaii. Webb organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over 9 tons (8,200 kg) of metal cans from the roadways and highways of Oahu. The metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects.1970 Navy Times Article The Stanolind Recycling Plant was in operation as early 1947. Another early recycling mill was Waste Techniques, built in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania in 1972. Waste Techniques was sold to Frank Keel in 1978, and resold to BFI in 1981. Woodbury, New Jersey, was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling. Led by Donald Sanderson who was President of Woodbury City Council and Woodbury Recycling Committee in the early 1970s, the idea of towing a \\"recycling\\" trailer behind a waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged. Other towns and cities soon followed suit, and today many cities in the United States make recycling a requirement. In 1987, the Mobro 4000 barge hauled garbage from New York to North Carolina; where it was denied. It was then sent to Belize, where it was denied as well. Finally, the barge returned to New York and the garbage was incinerated. The incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling. The incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling \\"hysteria\\" of the 1990s. Recycling education Integrating recycling into K-12 educational system has become a goal for many educators. Usually, it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms. This is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas.National Science Education Standards http://books.nap.edu/html/nses/6a.html National Council for the Social Studies standards http://www.ncss.org/standards/ Common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources, general environmental units, soil units, water units, community units, economic units, and geography units. Although interest is growing, major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in a textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards. For example, in a unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered.Foss Curriculum Guide. http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/foss/scope/index.html Non-profit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void. Some purely non-profit groups include the Center for a New American Dream and Be SMART.Be SMART (Save Money and Reduce Trash) http://besmart.org/education/index.html Other creators of curriculum include governmental offices. Some of these include Oregon,Oregon DEQ http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/education/curriculum.htm California,California Dept. of Conservation http://www.conservation.ca.gov/DOR/rre/Pages/Index.aspx and Waukesha County, Wisconsin.Waukesha County Teacher's Resources Page. http://www.waukeshacounty.gov/page.aspx?SetupMetaId=12100&id;=11440 Also, some non-profit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials. For example, the Keystone Center partnered with the United States Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory to create curriculum on global warming.Kestone Center Curriculum http://www.keystonecurriculum.org/ =America Recycles Day= America Recycles Day (ARD) is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to encouraging Americans to recycle and buy recycled products. ARD is celebrated annually on November 15. The World Recycling Day celebrated in most countries, though falls on July 8.

It has a reserve team which is in South Division Two. History The club has been reconstituted on several occasions since its formation in 1906. There was Bute Camanachd and North Bute Shinty Club: North Bute competed in the first ever Sutherland Cup final in 1923. The club has existed in its present form since 1946. The club won the Sutherland Cup in 1972 and has won the reintroduced Balliemore Cup on four occasions, notably in the first final in 1985 as well as in 2006, when they defeated a Beauly team who held home advantage. 2006 was one of the club's most successful seasons of all time winning South Division One thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division, winning the Balliemore Cup and reaching the final of the Celtic Society Cup. In 2008, after several years as a one team club, Bute restarted their second team, which finished fifth in South Division Two in their first season. The club reached the semi-finals of the Camanachd Cup for the first time in 2008. In 2009, they were the last club to finish their season on 12 December 2009. They eventually survived relegation, overhauling Lochaber Camanachd with a win against Oban Camanachd. 2010 saw Bute's period in the Premier Division come to an end with a loss against Oban Camanachd, who had been behind the whole season until that last game. Bute Vs Glenorchy Bute romped back into the Premier Division in 2011 with a stunning 100% record in the league as well as winning the Balliemore Cup. Bute were relegated in 2012 from a very competitive Premiership. The club's top player during this successful period has been Hector Whitelaw, a full international and a powerful player capable of playing both upfront and at the back. He is a prolific goalscorer. The club was one of the main opponents of the national league setup due to the difficulty of traveling to away games in places such as Cannich and Portree. (Until the establishment of Lewis Camanachd, they were the only senior team in Scotland with no fixed link to the mainland.). The stepping back of Whitelaw to the second team and the loss of the Zavaroni brothers to Kyles Athletic saw Bute take a step back but they still made good showings in the cups and also made it into the National Division One setup for 2014 with a second-place finish in Division South One. Several other player changes in 2014 led to a disastrous showing in National Division One, even conceding a game at one point. Bute finished rock bottom and were due for relegation to South Division One, but were given a reprieve due to league reconstruction. However, Bute elected to be relegated to South Division One, feeling that National Division shinty was not feasible for the club at that time. In January 2015, former referee Ted McDonald became their senior team coach.

In Ancient Greek society, it was deemed a high level of heroism or greatness for those who managed to return. This journey is usually very extensive and includes being shipwrecked in an unknown location and going through certain trials that test the hero. The return isn't just about returning home physically but also about retaining certain statuses and retaining your identity upon arrival. The theme of Nostos is brought to life in Homer's The Odyssey, where the main hero Odysseus tries to return home after battling in the Trojan War. Odysseus is challenged by many temptations, such as the Sirens and the Lotus-eaters. If Odysseus had given into these temptations it would have meant certain death and thus failing to return home. Nostos is used today in many forms of literature and movies. Nostos in The Odyssey In the Odyssey, Homer has nostos being the \\"return home from Troy by sea.\\" Nostos can be told by those who experienced it themselves, or there are simply instances in which it is present. Those who told their adventures on the sea on their journey back home from Troy were Menelaus, Nestor, and Odysseus. Those three recount their adventures to others in the epic. With Menelaus, in Book Four, he tells of his time in Egypt and other irregular stops. He did not stop at just his nostos but he told of Agamemnon's fatal nostos in great detail as well as a small section of Odysseus' journey. Nestor gives more on Menelaus' nostos and his journey home with Odysseus and Menelaus. In Book Three Nestor said \\"we pondered our long sea-voyage, whether we should sail over the top of rocky Chios by the island Psyros, keeping it on our left hand, or else to pass under Chios, by windy Mimas. We asked the god to give us some portent for a sign, and the god gave us one, and told us to cut across the middle main sea for Euboia, and so most quickly escape the hovering evil.\\"Homer, Odyssey 3.169-75. (The Odyssey of Homer. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper & Row, 1975. Print.) Here Nestor made it evident to the audience that his and Diomedes' journey home was a perfect nostos, they had no real issues, which was quite different from Agamemnon's. This great difference shows how different each hero's journey home could be. In these instances where nostos is simply present and not told by the individual in The Odyssey, there is an intention to reach a specific destination and some other force blowing the characters off course and arrive in unexpected places on their journey to their home. The Odyssey had several different instances of nostos. One specific instance where Odysseus' companions lost their nostos, was when they ate the cattle of Helios and were killed for this since they were specifically told not to. Odysseus warned the men when he said \\"Friends, since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship, let us then keep our hands off the cattle, for fear that something may befall us. These are the cattle and fat sheep of a dreaded god, Helios, who sees all things and listens to all things.\\"Homer, Odyssey 12.320-23. (The Odyssey of Homer. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper & Row, 1975. Print.) At that point Odysseus warns the men of what will happen if they eat the cattle, yet they do anyway. This situation took away their nostos because their journey home came to an end.Bonifazi, A.(2009). Inquiring into Nostos and Its Cognates. American Journal of Philology 130(4), 481-510. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 24, 2016, from Project MUSE database. Not all Greek heroes experience nostos. Achilles' nostos is unique in The Iliad; this is because he knows himself that he will not have a nostos, creating a greater difference between him and the other heroes, such as Odysseus. Achilles knows that he has two options when it comes to the Trojan War - he can either die in the battle with glory and have a short life, or not participate and live a long yet insignificant life. In the ninth book, he says \\"my nostos has perished, but my kleos will be unwilting\\". In this instance, he has chosen the route of glory and says he will not now return home because it is destined that he will die in battle. = Nostos and Odysseus = Odysseus was able to tell his own story of his nostos since he has survived. Odysseus was able to tell part of his nostos to the Phaeacians, and the length of his journey shows how difficult it can be to achieve nostos. This arrival and telling of his tales is a big deal, though he has not reached home it is a huge mile marker. After Odysseus and his companions leave Circe's palace safely his crew members show their happiness by saying \\"we rejoice for you saved yourself, nourished by Zeus, as much as if we had reached Ithaca,\\" which shows the comparison of escaping to returning home. Nostos meant several different things in this epic, it meant escaping death, safe landings, returning home from war, and being back home. All of those come through because as the hero returned from war the idea of escaping death from war remained in their forethought. These meanings all resemble nostos and when heroes are on their journey back they will have the ultimate Kleos once they have arrived and that is celebrated. Modern times The word nostalgia was first coined as a medical term in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669-1752), a Swiss medical student. It uses the word νόστος along with another Greek root, άλγος or algos, meaning pain, to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past. In James Joyce's Ulysses, the final part (episodes 16-18), during which Leopold Bloom returns home, is called the Nostos. Another depiction of nostos in contemporary media would be the example of the movie, Hercules Unchained, which was released in 1959.Clauss, J. J.(2008). Hercules Unchained: Contaminatio, Nostos, Katabasis, and the Surreal. Arethusa 41(1), 51-66. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 24, 2016, from Project MUSE database. This movie was similar to the Odyssey, Hercules' journey was very similar to Odysseus'. One specific instance being when Hercules returned home with Iole whom he won in an archery contest, which is similar to Odysseus' contest to save his marriage. He was accidentally poisoned by his wife and asked to have his body set on fire. Having his body set on fire is what led to his many heroic achievements. During that time period there were no other films like this one that depicted this type of ancient material. Hercules' nostos had him die and then be reborn, this is to rediscover his identity within himself and the community. This is similar to Odysseus because he transforms personally from a war machine to a family man. The TV series Star Trek: Voyager, in which the titular spacecraft is stranded 70,000 light-years from Earth and encounters numerous hostile and friendly aliens and strange phenomena on its way home, has been described by classicists as a nostos.

Baert first came to international prominence in the 1934 World Cup in Italy. He was selected as the referee for the quarter-final match between Italy, the hosts, and Spain. Bert initially disallowed an equalising goal from Italy, but changed his decision after protests from the Italian team. In a 2010 Sports Illustrated article, Georgina Turner suggested that Mussolini's influence may have affected the refereeing at the world cup. He was selected to run the line with Ivan Eklind in both the semi-final and the final, and went on to have a lengthy international career as a referee. Baert was also the referee for the match during the 1938 World Cup in which Italy, playing in their infamous ' strip, beat France in Paris. In total he took part in six World Cup matches. He first refereed internationals on 9 May 1929 and ended on 29 June 1952. After retiring from active football he became a member of the Executive Panel of the Belgian Football Association until his death in 1969.

It combines features of the lute, the harp, and the theorbo. It shares the form of its pear shaped body as well as its vibrating string length of 54 to 70 cm with the lute. Differing from the lute, the 16 string angelica was single-strung like a theorbo, with which it shares its extended neck with a second peg box, bearing six bass strings.  Overview  The angelica was tuned diatonically, like a harp: C – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – e – f – g – a – b – c’ – d’ – e’. That range is the same as that of the French or lesser theorbo, but the latter differs in that its tuning is reentrant: C – D – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – g – c' – e'– a – d'. The diatonic tuning limited its compass, but produced a full and clear tone by the increased use of open strings. Little surviving music for the angelica as well as few surviving instruments indicate that the angelica flourished during the second half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries. Some authors claim that the angelica was invented in England. But that claim is based on the misinterpretation of its name (M. H. Fuhrmann, Musicalischer Trichter, Frankfurt/Spree 1706, p. 91). James Talbot correctly interpreted angelica as “angel lute“ because of its lovely sound (ms. Oxford 532, 1685–1701). Music for the angelica is notated in French tablature, with the designation of bass courses varying according to respective authors. The Ukrainian Torban is a descendant of the Angélique.Desperate Measures: The Life and Music of Antonia Padoani Bembo by Claire Fontijn Bibliography *Jakob Kremberg, Musicalische Gemüths-Ergoetzung oder Arien ...

A Whig, he stood for Parliament and was elected as MP for Southwark from 1812 to 1830 and then from 1830 until his death in 1832. In Parliament, he allied himself with brewers’ interests, often opposing taxes on tobacco, beer and tea for their impacts on the working classes and on manufacturers. He opposed the blockade of Norway in 1814 and the resumption of hostilities with Napoleon, and supported parliamentary reform. He married Jane, youngest daughter of Sir William Rowley of Tendring Hall, Suffolk, in 1823, and lived at Ockley Court in Surrey and Kneller Hall in Twickenham, west London, up to his death from cholera in September 1832.

Based on historical records, the ancient Koreans generally worshiped the heavens and the sun, liked brightness, and considered their states governed by Heaven.단군학회 편저(1999), 한국종교와 단군 인식, 단군학회 (Editor: Dangun Institute, Korean National Religion and Understand of Dangun, Published by Dangun Institute) Because the thought about the Posterity of Heaven, an archaic word says that the people's mind is equal to the Heaven's mind, which warns rulers of the significance of the people. The Korean national anthem, Aegukga supports this concept. The lyrics of Aegukga say \\"May our nation be eternal by the protection and help of Heaven.\\" In addition, the National Foundation Day, Gaecheonjeol literally means the day when the sky was opened. It is natural that the sky should be opened for the Posterity of Heaven to found a nation.박인택, 한창수, 국경일에는 어떤 의미가 담겨있을까?-손에잡히는옛사람들의지혜13, 채우리 출간 (Author:Park Intaek, Han Changsu, The Meaning of National Hollidays, Published by Chaewoori) Title of rulers In very ancient times, there were a divine regent who had supervised and taught the people as a representative of the Heavenly God. These divine regents were called Hwanin, Hwanung and Dangun, based on the period. *The Hwanin (환인, 桓因 or 桓仁) was a supervisory ruler at legendary Hwanguk. The word \\"hwan\\" in Hwanin is the radical of the Korean word that corresponds to \\"bright\\" in English, and it is believed that Hwan is originally used to represent the heavens. Because the Koreans think of themselves as the descendants of the Heavenly God, the ancient Koreans called themselves Hwan. The word \\"In\\" of Hwanin means a providential supervisor as a representative of the Heavenly God such that the benefits of the Heavenly God should be maximally served to the entire people, and the whole nation should be enlightened by the teaching of the Heavenly. Thus, Hwanin can be translated as Divine Regent. *The Hwanung (환웅, 桓雄) was a supervisory ruler at legendary Baedal, and the power of Hwanun seems to be stronger than Hwanin. Because the word \\"woong\\" of Hwanwoong means a preeminent person, and it seems that \\"In\\" is just replaced with \\"woong\\" to make the word. This implies that Hwanun was likely to be elected among the eminent people in nations. Korean legendary history books say that the ruler of Baedal nation was selected to be a ruler because he is so wise and brilliant. thus, Hwanun can be translated into Supreme Divine Regent. *The Dangun (단군, 檀君) was a ruler's title of Gojoseon, and it is said to a theocracy state. It is said that Gojoseon was founded at the place where many birch trees existed. At that time, people roughly called the Gojoseon as the Birchen Nation because hanja for \\"Dan\\" means a birch tree. At this time, the power of a ruler was stronger than Baedal nation so that the word \\"Gun\\" was used (\\"Gun\\" means a king). Thus, Dangun can be translated into Heavenly Regent King. Someone say that the pronunciation of Korean translation for Dan(檀) is similar with the pronunciation of the Korean word \\"bright.\\" So, Dangun means the king of \\"Bright Nation.\\" *The Taewang (태왕, 太王) was a ruler's title of Goguryeo. The \\"Tae\\" in Taewang means literally great. The people of Goguryeo also had the consciousness of the Posterity of Heaven, but the power of a ruler seemed to be more powerful than Gojoseon. Based on national religion, the whole universe is composed of three things such as the Heaven, the Earth and the Great. It is said that the Great is the noblest among them, and the Great connect and mediate the Heaven and the Earth. So, Taewang can be translated into Supreme King. Korean kingdoms had used both titles of kings and emperors as the title of rulers because they thought that the highest rulers was Heaven, and all rulers must be a representative of Heaven. This concept of the Posterity of Heaven is somewhat different from the Chinese concept of the Son of Heaven. It is believed that the Chinese emperor governs the Chinese as the son of Heaven. But, the Koreans believe that they themselves are the descendants of Heaven, the Heavenly God governs them by himself, and a ruler of a nation is nothing but the supervisor as a representative of Heaven. Anniversary sacrifice to Heaven Because of the Koreans' thought about Heavenly offspring, they have had an anniversary sacrifice (month is as lunar calendar). Scholars say that dolmen in Manchuria and Korean Peninsula was an altar to sacrifice to Heaven. * Gojoseon: Sangdalje (상달제, 上月祭) at October. * Buyeo: Yeonggo (영고, 迎鼓) at November. * Dongye: Mucheon (무천, 舞天) at October. * Samhan: Gipungje (기풍제, 祈豊祭) at May, and Chusugamsaje (추수감사제, 秋收感謝祭, Harvest festival) at October. * Goguryeo: Dongmaeng (동맹, 東盟) at October. * Silla: Palgwanhoe (팔관회, 八關會). This sacrifice seems to be mixed with Buddhism. * Goryeo: Palgwanhoe (팔관회, 八關會), Choje (초제, 醮祭). * Joseon: Sajik Daeje (사직대제, 社稷大祭). Joseon was used to perform the national soil and grain ceremonies mixed with Korean Confucian traditions.

Andér, who later made a model of the universe, as described in Toward the Light. A sample of Michael Agerskov's handwriting Michael Agerskov (1870-1933) was a Danish spiritualist teacher and author, best known for his book, Toward the Light, which he co-authored with his wife Johanne Agerskov. Agerskov's literary production includes poems, novels, and also schoolbooks for the primary school and the secondary school in Denmark. Together with Erling Rørdam he also wrote a reader, published several times during 1904 and 1933, and also translated into Swedish.  Overview  In the first decade of the last century Michael Agerskov became interested in spiritistic phenomena, and participated in spiritistic séances together with his wife, and he also produced several poems by the means of what was called automatic writing, the hand writing down the thoughts of a discarnated spirit. Many of these poems were made public. It soon became obvious that Johanne Agerskov was an intermediary, and they formed a circle together with two other couples, and held séances, because they were told that they before their incarnation had promised to take on the task of being the instrumental to bring to mankind some truths from the transcendental world. Johanne Agerskov had the unique ability to close off her own thoughts, and to intuitively receive the thoughts of the spirits that contacted her. The other participants were called on to form questions, on which the spirits gave the answers, which were then written down. This work continued for several years, and resulted in the publishing of the ethic-religious, philosophic and scientific book Toward the Light and to several other books concerning the same issues. Michael Agerskov was the publisher of all the books, along with his work as a teacher, censor and author of his own literary works. Toward the Light was distributed to all the bishops and to 60 ministers of the Danish church, and the Agerskovs' hope and intention was the Danish church to go through a reformation on the basis of the information given in Toward the Light with the participation of the bishops and the ministers. But even though Toward the Light had many followers among the common people, the church did not react, and the book did not lead to a public interest to any extent. Even though Michael and Johanne Agerskov had participated in spiritistic séances, they soon urged the spiritists to end their activities. In Toward the Light there is very clearly stated that the spirits of the dead human beings are not allowed to visit the earth, because they need to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation. Only if we are called upon by the spirits of the light, we should react to their calling. After many requests, Michael Agerskov in 1922 wrote the story about the extraordinary events that had led to the publishing of Toward the Light in the book, Some Psychic Experiences. In 1928 Agerskov had a serious attack of influenza, and as a repercussion of the illness he developed a serious condition of increasing paralysis of the muscles, and he had to end his work as a teacher. In 1932 he was so weak that he could not cross the floor of their living room by his own means, and soon after the condition also involved the heart muscle. He died in 1933.

It is largely a mixed residential area centred on the Manor. The nearest town is Marlborough, to the north. The parish includes the following hamlets: * Clench – to the north, near Wootton Rivers * Fyfield with Fyfield Manor – west, near Pewsey (not to be confused with the village of Fyfield near Marlborough) * Little Salisbury – west, on the Pewsey-Burbage road * Littleworth – north, on the other side of the Pewsey-Burbage road * Milkhouse Water, formerly Milcot Water – northwest, by the Avon * New Mill – north, also by the Avon The parish is unusual in that it has a long thin shape and is one of the few to have boundaries on the uplands to both south and north of the Vale. The southern boundary passes by a long barrow and the northern one abuts the prehistoric fort on Martinsell Hill. History The parish contains several prehistoric features including the Giants Grave to the south (a Neolithic long barrow) and a Bronze Age Barrow Cemetery at Milton Hill Farm. \\"Milton\\" in the village's name probably derives from its position as \\"middle tun\\" between Pewsey and Easton Royal, the \\"east tun\\". \\"Lilbourne\\" is from Lillebonne, the surname of lords of the manor. The Manor House dates from c.1710 and is Grade II* listed. Parish church There was a vicarage here by 1195. The parish church of St Peter is in squared and coursed rubble with stone dressings, and ashlar copings and battlements. When the chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century, the jambs of the arch of the 12th-century church were retained; the four-bay north arcade is from the 13th century. Restoration of the chancel in 1859 was to designs of G.E. Street, and in 1875 J. L. Pearson retired the nave, aisle and porch. The northwest tower has six bells, five of them cast by Robert Wells II in 1789. The building was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1959. The benefice was united with Easton Royal in 1929, and with Pewsey and Wootton Rivers in 1991. Today the parish is part of the Vale of Pewsey team of churches, centered on St John's, Pewsey. Transport The Kennet and Avon Canal crosses the parish, using the Avon valley. The Reading to Taunton railway follows the same route; the nearest station is Pewsey. From 1928 to 1966 there was a halt at Wootton Rivers, a short distance outside the parish. Amenities Facilities include the Village Hall with its playing fields. On the Pewsey- Burbage road in the area known as Little Salisbury stood the Three Horse Shoes pub, closed in 2009. The nearest shops are in Pewsey, about away.

Photo from 1922 Danish inventor, Rasmus Malling-Hansen, father of Johanne Agerskov. Photo from 1887 Johanne Elisabeth Agerskov (1873–1946) was a Danish medium. Together with her husband, Michael Agerskov, she was responsible for the ethico-religious, philosophical, and pseudo-scientific book, Toward the Light (in Danish, Vandrer mod Lyset!), first published by Michael Agerskov in Copenhagen in 1920. Early life She was a daughter of a Danish inventor, minister and principal of the Royal Institute for Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen Rasmus Malling-Hansen ( 1835 - 1890 ). In her younger days Johanne Agerskov worked as a teacher, and she married Michael Agerskov in 1899. Their only daughter, Inger Agerskov, was born in 1900, and Johanne became a housewife. Spiritualism During the first decade of the twentieth century, Michael became interested in spiritual phenomena, and persuaded his wife to participate in séances, even though she was skeptical in the beginning. Soon Johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her, and had given her the message that she was a medium, and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind. Convinced that she had a special mission, Agerskov and her husband formed a circle with two more couples, and for many years held weekly séances, in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to Agerskov through intuitive thought-inspiration. She claimed a unique ability to close off her own thoughts, so that all she could \\"hear\\" in her mind, according to her, was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact. That was very demanding, and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life, in order to be focused and prepared for the séances. The members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits, and shortly she would give them answers, supposedly from the spirits, which the other participants would write down. A message to mankind That resulted in the publication of the book, Toward the Light, which Agerskov called \\"a message to mankind from the transcendental world\\", and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the Danish national church. Their hope was that these would participate in a reformation of the Danish church, based upon the new knowledge given in Toward the Light. The Agerskovs made great efforts to that end, through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about Toward the Light; but there was little public interest in the book, and the expected reformation did not take place. Johanne Agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father. In 1924 a Danish professor asserted that Malling-Hansen was not the inventor of the Hansen Writing Ball, and Agerskov undertook a thorough investigation of the facts, together with her sister, Engelke Wiberg. They wrote several articles on the subject, and Agerskov also wrote a book, called Hvem var Skrivekuglens Opfinder? (Who was the Inventor of the Writing Ball?), published in Copenhagen in 1925. Later life In 1926 a Society for the Advancement of Toward the Light was formed , which offered religious services for its members, based on Toward the Light. Agerskov was skeptical, however, because Toward the Light calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within. Even though the Agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist séances, they soon asked their followers to end that activity, because, as they asserted in Toward the Light, calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear. The spirits, they said, needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation, and were not allowed to visit the earth. Michael Agerskov died in 1933, but Johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until 1938, in collaboration with their daughter. During the last years of her life, Johanne Agerskov suffered from illness, and was not able to leave her home.  Photos of Johanne Agerskov  There has been controversy among Agerskov's followers over whether or not to publish photos of her, as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died. Some of the followers of Toward the Light! contend that her will in this matter should be respected, and oppose the publication of such pictures. Others see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her, considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both Denmark and Norway, and on the World-Wide Web. This article contains photos of both Agerskov and her husband, supplied by their descendants, who have no objection to their publication.

The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim.Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p264 The net claim is known as a net position. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor. Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the mutual debts have been set off. The power of net positions is in reducing credit exposure, and also holds regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to market stabilityLouise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th ed 2017 Difference between set-off and netting Whilst netting and set-off are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between netting, which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a set-off. By contrast set-off describes the legal bases for producing net positions. Netting describes the form such as novation netting, or close-out netting, whilst set-off describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set-off or insolvency set-off. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk. =Mutuality= The law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability.P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set-off and Netting, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1995), 189 All forms of set-off require mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency. Market effect The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company.Finch, Milman Corporate Insolvency Law (2016, Cambridge University Press, Third edition) Netting At least three principal forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets. Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, risk =Novation netting= Also called rolling netting, netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims. This differs from settlement netting (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency.Commissioner for HMRC v Entin [2006] BCC 955 per Lightman J [21] The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to settlement netting, novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. =Close out netting= An effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market.EFMLG The regulation of close out netting in the new member states of the European Union 2005, 3 Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by ISDA. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default or insolvency. In the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially \\"cherry pick\\").ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, Section 2(1)(a)(iii) There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested. The key elements of close out netting are: *default *the accretion of the time for performance of obligations to the time of default *conversion of non-cash obligations into debts; meaning obligations to deliver non-cash assets are converted to market price equivalents; and *set offSee the Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, Art 2(1)(n) Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such asrepos, forwards or options.ISDA master agreement The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK.Cf Insolvency Rules 1986 Rule 4.90 The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under Basel II and other Insolvency- related matters seen in the Lamfalussy ReportEuropean Commission,Report from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament, Evaluation Report on the Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive (2002/47/EC), 2006, COM (2006) 833 final, 10 has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform.Benjamin, 269 In England & Wales, the effect of British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France has largely been negated by Part VII of the Company Act 1989 which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the BASEL Accords, the first set of guidelines, BASEL I, was missing guidelines on netting. BASEL II introduced netting guidelines. =Settlement netting= For cash settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions. Obligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged.P Wood, Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1995),153-5 Unlike close-out netting, settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance.Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274 Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned British Eagle. These are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. ::*Bilateral Net Settlement System: A settlement system in which every individual bilateral combination of participants settles its net settlement position on a bilateral basis. ::*Multilateral Net Settlement System: A settlement system in which each settling participant settles its own multilateral net settlement position (typically by means of a single payment or receipt). Set off Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person (\\"Party A\\") who owed money to another (\\"Party B\\") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished. In certain jurisdictions (including the UKInsolvency Act 1986, section 323; Insolvency Rules 1986, rule 4.90.), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticizedRiz Mokal Corporate Insolvency Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2005) as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk.Louise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th ed) 2017Roy Goode, Principles of Corporate Insolvency (Fourth Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2013), 278 Even still, three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs.Stein v Blake [1993]; Halesowen Presswork Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk, is crucial. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house, and seller and clearing out. The effect is an automatic novation, meaning all elements are internalized in current accounts. This can be in different currencies as long as they are converted during calculation. The right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken. =Set-off by country= Two primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives. English law set-off Under English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:Roy Goode, Principles of Corporate Insolvency (Fourth Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2013), 278Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274 # Legal set-off. or Independent set-offP Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1995), 189 What is known as statutory set-off, this arises where a claim and a counterclaim in a court action are both liquidated sums or ascertained with certainty. This is wider than insolvent set-off, but the claim and cross claim must be mutual and liquidated. In such cases the court will simply set-off the amounts and award a net sum. The two claims do not need to be intrinsically connected. # Equitable set-off. or Transaction set-off Outside of litigation, where two mutual claims arise out of the same matter or a sufficiently closely related matter and an injustice would be done if not enforced, the claims will set off in equity.P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1995), 189 Both sums must be due and payable, but may be for liquidated or unliquidated sums. Unlike Independent set-off, this is not self-executing # Contractual Set-off made by express agreement. Often netting will arise through express agreement to the parties, the ISDA master agreement is an example of this type, which is ineffective against an insolvent party but is often used to address pre-insolveny credit risk and reduce the need for collateral. # Banker’s set-off. or Current Account Set-off Sometimes referred to as a banker's right to combine accounts, this is a special form of set-off which is implied into contractual agreements with bankers and allows banks to offset sums in one account against another account which is overdrawn from the same client.National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork & Assemblies Ltd [1972] AC 785 However, the right cannot be exercised if one of the accounts is a loan account, or if the bank has agreed not to exercise the right, or if the bank has notice that the sums in the account are for a specific purpose, or on trust for another party. It is said to derive from a bankers' lien, however this is misleading as it is only available where both accounts are maintained in the same capacity. Difference in currency will not prevent this right, however.Miliangos v George Frank Ltd [1976] AC 443 # Insolvency set-off. It is perhaps the most expensive form of set off. Under section 323 of the Insolvency Act 1986Rule 4.90 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 for companies. where a person goes into bankruptcy or a company goes into liquidation mutual debts are automatically set-off. This is a mandatory operation in bilateral situations. Whether the debt is liquidated or unliquidated does not matter, and the set-off will apply to future or contingent claims if the debts are provable. Insolvency set-off operates on liquidation and administration, where the administrator gives notice of his intention to make a distribution.Rules 14.25 and 14.25 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set- off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality. US law set- off See De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its common-law right of set-off”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211) See, e.g., United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) (\\"government has the same right 'which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him' \\" (quoting Gratiot v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759 (1841))); see also Tatelbaum v. United States, 10 Cl.Ct. 207, 210 (1986) (set-off right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts).

As a conductor, he specialised in the music of late romantic composers; including Edward Elgar, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss. He left a great legacy of recordings of British music, in particular Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frederick Delius, and Benjamin Britten. He notably conducted the premiere recording of Britten's children's opera Noye's Fludde. Life and career Born in Hampstead, London, Del Mar began his career as a horn player. He was one of the original members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), which was established by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946. Within the first few months of the RPO's existence, Beecham appointed Del Mar as his assistant conductor. Del Mar made his professional debut as a conductor with the RPO in 1947. In 1949 Del Mar was appointed principal conductor of the English Opera Group, in which post he remained until 1954. In 1952 he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of Franz Reizenstein's radio opera Anna Kraus. He then held chief conducting posts with the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra (1954) the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (1960–1965), and the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra (1985–1988). A regular at the BBC Proms concerts, he conducted the famous Last Night on three occasions: 1973, 1975, and 1983. He was also 'permanent guest conductor' with the Göteborg Symphony Orchestra from 1969–1973. Norman Del Mar's grave at St Peter's Church in Limpsfield, Surrey, photographed in 2013 In 1953 Del Mar joined the faculty of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where he conducted the school's orchestra and taught conducting until 1960. In 1972 he began to teach conducting at the Royal College of Music, serving until 1990. He also conducted the Royal Academy of Music's orchestra from 1974–1977. In 1976 he conducted the world premiere of Thomas Wilson's Opera The Confessions of a Justified Sinner, based on the novel by James Hogg. A cast led by Philip Langridge, Thomas Hemsley and John Shirley-Quirk speaks for itself. To keep a new work in the repertoire for as many as thirteen performances also shows the confidence the company had in the piece. He was an authority on Richard Strauss and wrote a three-volume work on Strauss's life and music. In addition, his books include the following titles: * Anatomy of the Orchestra () * Conducting Beethoven (, Volume 1; , Volume 2) * Conducting Berlioz () * Conducting Brahms () * Conducting Elgar (, compiled and edited by his son Jonathan Del Mar) * Conducting Favourite Concert Pieces () * Mahler's sixth symphony : a study () * Orchestral variations : confusion and error in the orchestral repertoire () As well as making approximately 70 recordings of his own, Del Mar was a lifelong record collector, and his extensive collection of rare 78s is held by the University of Southampton. He died in 1994, aged 74. He has two sons. The elder is the Beethoven editor Jonathan Del Mar, and the younger is Robin Del Mar who is a viola player.

Although he has written three Doctor Who novels, for the BBC Books range, his work has mostly been for Big Finish Productions' audio drama and book ranges. Work Guerrier's earliest published fiction appeared in Zodiac, the first of Big Finish's Short Trips range of Doctor Who short story anthologies. To date, his work has appeared in the majority of the Short Trips collections. He has also edited three volumes in the series, The History of Christmas, Time Signature and How the Doctor Changed My Life. The second of these takes as its starting-point Guerrier's short story An Overture Too Early in The Muses. The third anthology featured stories entirely by previously unpublished writers. After contributing two stories to the anthology Life During Wartime in Big Finish's Bernice Summerfield range of books and audio dramas, Guerrier was invited to edit the subsequent year's short story collection, A Life Worth Living, and the novella collection Parallel Lives. After contributing two audio dramas to the series, Guerrier became the producer of the Bernice Summerfield range of plays and books, a post he held between January 2006 and June 2007.Bernice Summerfield – The Inside Story, Chapter 13. Published by Big Finish, 2009 His other Doctor Who work includes the audio dramas, The Settling and The Judgement of Isskar, in Big Finish's Doctor Who audio range, three Companion Chronicles and a contribution to the UNIT spinoff series. He has also written a play in Big Finish's Sapphire and Steel range.

However, these clubs are not always student teams in the strictest sense of the word, and have a long history of participation at national senior level. Since the introduction of a summer season, only the Aberdeen University Shinty Club continues to play in the senior leagues, although Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews have all done so in the past. A Varsity match with Glasgow University in action against Strathclyde University History Scottish universities have played a major role in shinty since the early days of the sport. The University of Aberdeen club was founded in 1861, and clubs were founded at universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow in the late Victorian era. Aberdeen played in North competitions and Edinburgh and Glasgow competed in South competitions. Often these teams would compete in \\"Junior\\" competitions but would also from time to time restrict themselves to the University Littlejohn competition. University of St Andrews became the fourth and final team to enter league shinty in the late 1960s. This meant that all four of Scotland's ancient universities had a shinty team representing them. The original three had varying degrees of success but won, or appeared in the finals of several cup competitions as well as garnering league success throughout their league existence. =The Littlejohn= The Littlejohn of Invercharron Vase is the trophy played for by the universities. It was presented in 1905 and has been played for ever since. =The move to Summer Shinty and effects on University Shinty= The move to the summer season in the sport meant that of the four teams playing in the north and south leagues only the University of Aberdeen continued to play on a full-time basis. However, the change in status means that players from clubs playing in the National Leagues such as Kingussie and Fort William can now play for their university outwith the senior season. Previously these players could only compete in the annual one-day Littlejohn Vase tournament. They may now play in the winter University League. The Scottish Universities also have a representative side which currently plays against the British Universities GAA in Composite rules Shinty/Hurling annually. There are seven teams entering the University Shinty League for the 2010/11 season, these are Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, RGU (Robert Gordon University), St Andrews and Strathclyde. This season saw the demise of UHI, with many teams sighing in relief. The men's league is currently being led by a rejuvenated Glasgow side, with their female counterpart making a strong start to their season after many years playing under the banner of Strathclyde. =Effects of University Shinty on the sport= The sport of shinty as a whole has benefited greatly from its presence in universities. Many alumni have gone onto play a role in reviving or reinvigorating the sport in their home area or the area in which they have settled after graduation, including Skye, Lewis, London, Cornwall and Caithness. Many players have retained their links with the sport when otherwise they would have drifted away in the urban area. Clubs =Aberdeen University Shinty Club= For the article about the senior side of the same name see Aberdeen University Shinty Club. This club is the successor to the University of Aberdeen side which continued in the senior leagues with the advent of summer shinty in 2004. The two clubs maintain a symbiotic relationship, by having the players from the senior team helping with training. Although non-students can play for the senior side, only students can play for the students' side. Aberdeen University welcome all players from all levels to train and play and are well known for giving people who have never played shinty a taste and help them develop into shinty players. See the senior side article for more information on the history of the club. =Edinburgh University Shinty Club= See Edinburgh University Shinty Club for more information The second oldest University club, founded in 1891, Edinburgh has, since 2011 become a force in the University sport, winning three Littlejohn's in 2012, 2013 and 2014. This brought to end an almost thirty-year drought. =Glasgow University Shinty Club= See Glasgow University Shinty Club for more information One of the historically successful clubs, Glasgow University has failed to achieve success since winning South Division Two in 2003 and the advent of summer shinty. =St Andrews University Shinty Club= See St. Andrew's University Shinty Club =Strathclyde University Shinty Club= Teams representing the University of Strathclyde had been competing in the Littlejohn Vase since the early 1990s. Most matriculated students who did not play for their home club tended to play for Glasgow University in the senior leagues. Despite being able to draw upon a good base of players and perhaps hampered by a lack of familiarity which other universities had from playing regularly together, Strathclyde did not win the Littlejohn until in 2005 when they also won the first official University league. They reached the final in 2006 when they lost to Robert Gordon. However, Strathclyde once again won the trophy in 2007 which saw them defeat Dundee University 2-0 in the final. The Strathclyde team have been the strongest force in University shinty in the late 2000s with players from the Premier Division and North Division One making up the entirety of their team. They appeared in five straight Littlejohn finals equalling the record of bitter rivals Glasgow University. =Robert Gordon University Shinty Club= Robert Gordon University was started by shinty players such as Davie \\"Trout\\" Roberston in the 1990s but became a force in University shinty when Glenurquhart Shinty Club's John Barr who made RGU a tough proposition for any team, especially in Aberdeen, played for the University. RGU won the Littlejohn in 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2010. The University also runs a ladies' team, which featured Eilidh Middleton, an international Equestrianist. It also depends on many Irish students with a background in Hurling. =Dundee University Shinty Club= Dundee University Shinty Club is a shinty club from the city of Dundee founded in 2004. Its men's and women's teams are representing University of Dundee in University Shinty league and at numerous tournaments throughout the year. The club have performed rapidly since formation winning the SUSF (now SSS University) league in 2006/07 and also reaching the final of the Littlejohn Vase tournament in 2006. The current men's team captain is Hamish Duff. The women's team was established in 2013 and officially entered University Shinty league prior to 2014/15 season. They also compete in the same tournaments throughout the year as the men's team. The current women's team captain is Kirsty Fraser. =University of Abertay Dundee Shinty Club= University of Abertay Dundee have the distinction of having won every Littlejohn they have competed in, having only competed in one to this point in 2003 defeating Glasgow University in the final 2-1. They have failed to make an appearance at any Littlejohn since. They have a sixes team which plays infrequently. = University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI)= The UHI Millennium Institute, which is a collection of various colleges from across the Scottish Highlands and Islands entered a team in the University Shinty League for the first time in 2008. As the UHI has institutions in areas such as Inverness-shire and Lochaber they can draw on a strong pool of players. By 2011 however UHI had folded, the difficulty in fulfilling midweek fixtures for a team made up mostly of tradesmen spread across the Highlands was a contributory factor. =Playing Colours= *Abertay: All Black With Gold Trim *Aberdeen: Blue Shirts, White Shorts, Blue Socks *Dundee: Red Shirts, Black Shorts and Socks *Edinburgh: Green Shirts, Navy Shorts, Navy Socks *Glasgow: Gold Shirts, Black Shorts, Black and Gold Hooped Socks *RGU: White and Blacks Stripes or Red with Black Trim. *St Andrews: Sky Blue and White Quarters *Strathclyde: Maroon and Gray. *UHI: All Black.

The club, which represents the University of Edinburgh has both male and female team sides, with players coming from other further and higher education establishments in the city, including Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh Napier and Edinburgh College. Whilst formally a University Shinty team, the club has a long history of playing at national level. History The period 1927 to 1933 is the most notable in the club's history, with the university retaining the Littlejohn Vase for six years in succession. In those days the team was also competing in the Southern League and the Camanachd Cup. The team was once so strong it fielded a second string after the Second World War. Through the 1960s and 1970s the club remained strong. In the 1980s the club competed in Division Three (South) save for one regrettable year of isolation when fixtures were provided by the Littlejohn Vase. Such a period shows how a University team’s fortunes can fluctuate as the season 1986-87 saw the team narrowly miss promotion, 1987-88 saw relegation to Division Four. In 1991 the club enjoyed its centenary year in which a grand reunion was organised. Guests of honour included Sorley MacLean, who played for the club in the late twenties. In 2004, the club played its last games of senior shinty with the advent of summer shinty, meaning that the university could not field a team through the summer months. Players now return to their hometown teams or will play for local sides Tayforth Camanachd and Aberdour Shinty Club. 2011 saw a transition period for the club and the resurrection of the yearly challenge match with Trinity College where the Scottish and Irish capital sides play each other at the start of the year in a shinty/hurling match. The trip in 2011 proved so successful that a yearly tour to Dublin is now undertaken and eagerly anticipated. A friendship was formed with St Judes GAA in 2012 where the club travelled to Templeogue for a shinty/hurling challenge match. The club shall now play St Judes and Trinity in alternate years in the Irish capital, alongside St. Brigid's. The successful ladies' side of the 2000s was instrumental in the foundation of Forth Camanachd and subsequent developments in ladies shinty in the area, with many transferring to Aberdour when Forth folded. In 2012, the club won the Littlejohn for the first time in 26 years, defeating Glasgow University 1-0 in the final. The club won the Littlejohn again in 2013 where they defeated rivals Strathclyde University 1-0 in the final at St Andrews.

Although formally a University Shinty team, representing the University of Glasgow, it has a long history of competition in national competition. History Founded in 1901, by Angus MacVicar, Murdo Mackenzie and Murdo MacRae, with MacVicar as the first team captain. It entered League competition between 1906 and 1908 and played on the pitch of the Glasgow Skye Shinty Club until 1909, after which it played at the Glasgow Cowal Club pitch at Possilpark, Glasgow. The Club became affiliated to the Glasgow University Sports Association in 1911. Throughout the years the club has also been very strong in University competition, its glory years being in the late 1950s and 1960s, when they won the southern league and the Littlejohn three years in a row. Throughout the latter half of the club's existence from the late 1940s until his death in 2015 Jack Asher, who latterly was honorary president, attended games and supported the club. The club organises an annual 6 aside tournament in his memory. The club struggled in the 1980s although they had reached the final of the Sutherland Cup in 1981 but the late 1990s saw a renaissance in the team, the club appearing in 5 Littlejohn finals in a row, winning the trophy twice and the club's final season in 2003 in the south leagues saw them win South Division Two undefeated. However, the switch to a summer season in shinty resulted in the University leaving the league set-up. Their last senior fixture was a Glasgow Celtic Society Cup match against Tayforth in the spring of 2004. Since 2004 amid the advent of summer shinty, the club's fortunes suffered a downturn on the park, although membership stayed steady. Glasgow failed to reach a Littlejohn final or challenge for the league between 2005 and 2010 as an exceptionally strong Strathclyde side swept all before them. However, 2011 saw a rejuvenated Glasgow leading the University league and reach the Littlejohn Final for the first time since 2004. The club reached the final again in 2012 but they were thwarted by Edinburgh, who won their first trophy in 26 years, Glasgow's drought now lasting since 2002. In 2015 the club won the University league, notably completing the double over a Strathclyde team that went on to win the Littlejohn that year. The Glasgow University Ladies team won the University League for the first time in 2019. The club has one of the shortest pitches in shinty and was one of the first clubs to make effective use of the internet as a recruiting tool. The club is also a major force for promoting shinty, through Gaelic the team also known in Scots Gaelic as An t-Òr is Dubh, the Gold and Blacks.

In Western Christianity, it is celebrated on November 1 by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Methodist Church, the Philippine Independent Church or the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, the Church of the Nazarene, the Lutheran Church, the Reformed Church, and other Protestant churches. November 1 is also the day before All Souls' Day. The Eastern Orthodox Church and associated Eastern Catholic and Byzantine Lutheran churches celebrate it on the first Sunday after Pentecost. The Church of the East and associated Eastern Catholic churches celebrate All Saints' Day on the first Friday after Easter. In the Western Christian practice, the liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October, All Hallows' Eve (All Saints' Eve), and ends at the close of 1 November. It is thus the day before All Souls' Day, which commemorates the faithful departed. In many traditions, All Saints' Day is part of the season of Allhallowtide, which includes the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive and in some denominations, such as Anglicanism, extends to Remembrance Sunday. In places where All Saints' Day is observed as a public holiday but All Souls' Day is not, cemetery and grave rituals such as offerings of flowers, candles and prayers or blessings for the graves of loved ones often take place on All Saints Day. In Austria and Germany, godparents gift their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel (All Saint's Braid) on All Saint's Day, while the practice of souling remains popular in Portugal. It is a national holiday in many Christian countries. The Christian celebration of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day stems from a belief that there is a powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven (the \\"Church triumphant\\"), and the living (the \\"Church militant\\"). In Catholic theology, the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven. In Methodist theology, All Saints Day revolves around \\"giving God solemn thanks for the lives and deaths of his saints\\", including those who are \\"famous or obscure\\". As such, individuals throughout the Church Universal are honoured, such as Paul the Apostle, Augustine of Hippo and John Wesley, in addition to individuals who have personally led one to faith in Jesus, such as one's grandmother or friend. Combined celebrations of All Saints and All Souls In some countries, All Saints' Day is a public holiday, but All Souls' Day is not. Consequently, people visit graves and conduct other All Souls' Day practices on All Saints Day instead. Countries where All Souls' Day traditions are observed on All Saints' Day in this fashion include Belgium,\\"All Saints' Day honors the deceased\\", USAG Benelux Public Affairs, November 1, 2017 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France,\\"The Flower of Death\\", Couleur Nature, Paris, 25 July 2011 Finland, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\\"National holiday: November 1st is All Saints Day – Portugal\\", Portuguese American Journal, 1 November 2011 Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, and Sweden. In Eastern Europe and Western Asia The Eastern Orthodox Church, following the Byzantine tradition, commemorates all saints collectively on the Sunday after Pentecost, All Saints' Sunday (Greek: Ἁγίων Πάντων, Agiōn Pantōn). By 411 the East Syrians kept the Chaldean Calendar with a \\"Commemoratio Confessorum\\" celebrated on the Friday after Easter. commemoration on the Friday after Easter. The 74th homily of St. John Chrysostom from the late 4th or early 5th century marks the observance of a feast of all the martyrs on the first Sunday after Pentecost. Some scholars place the location where this sermon was delivered as Constantinople. The Byzantine Rite still celebrates the Feast of All Saints on the first Sunday after Pentecost. The Feast of All Saints achieved greater prominence in the 9th century, in the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI \\"the Wise\\" (866–911). His wife, Empress Theophano lived a devout life. After her death in 893,The date in Vita Euthymii, not printed until 1888 \\"makes it seem practically (though not absolutely) certain that she died on 10 Nov. 893\\". her husband built a church, intending to dedicate it to her. When he was forbidden to do so, he decided to dedicate it to \\"All Saints\\", so that if his wife were in fact one of the righteous, she would also be honoured whenever the feast was celebrated. According to tradition, it was Leo who expanded the feast from a commemoration of All Martyrs to a general commemoration of All Saints, whether martyrs or not. This Sunday marks the close of the Paschal season. To the normal Sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints (known and unknown) from the Pentecostarion. In the late spring, the Sunday following Pentecost Saturday (50 days after Easter) is set aside as a commemoration of all locally venerated saints, such as \\"All Saints of America\\", \\"All Saints of Mount Athos\\", etc. The third Sunday after Pentecost may be observed for even more localised saints, such as \\"All Saints of St. Petersburg\\", or for saints of a particular type, such as \\"New Martyrs of the Turkish Yoke\\". In addition to the Mondays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the Octoechos. =Lebanon= The celebration of 1 November in Lebanon as a holiday reflects the influence of Western Catholic orders present in Lebanon and is not Maronite in origin. The traditional Maronite feast equivalent to the honor of all saints in their liturgical calendar is one of three Sundays in preparation for Lent called the Sunday of the Righteous and the Just. The following Sunday is the Sunday of the Faithful Departed (similar to All Souls Day in Western calendar). =East Syriac tradition= In East Syriac tradition the All Saints Day celebration falls on the first Friday after resurrection Sunday. This is because all departed faithful are saved by the blood of Jesus and they resurrected with the Christ. Normally in east Syriac liturgy the departed souls are remembered on Friday. Church celebrates All souls day on Friday before the beginning of Great lent or Great Fast.... In Western Europe, the Americas and the Philippines The Christian holiday of All Saints' Day falls on 1 November, followed by All Souls' Day on 2 November, and is currently a Solemnity in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, as well as a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. =History= During the 5th century, St. Maximus of Turin preached annually on the Sunday after Pentecost, the same day being used in many places in the East, in honor of all martyrs in what is today Northern Italy. The Comes of Würzburg, the earliest existing ecclesiastical reading list, dating to the late 6th or early 7th century in what is today Germany, lists this the Sunday after Pentecost as \\"dominica in natale sanctorum\\" or \\"Sunday of the Nativity of the Saints\\". By this time, the commemoration had expanded to include all saints whether or not they were martyred. On 13 May 609 or 610, Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon at Rome to the Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs, ordering an anniversary; the feast of the dedication Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres has been celebrated at Rome ever since. There is evidence that from the 5th to the 7th centuries there existed in certain places and at sporadic intervals a feast date on 13 May to celebrate the holy martyrs.C. Smith The New Catholic Encyclopedia 1967: s.v. \\"Feast of All Saints\\", p. 318. The origin of All Saints' Day cannot be traced with certainty, and it has been observed on various days in different places. However, there are some who maintain the belief that it has origins in the pagan observation of 13 May, the Feast of the Lemures, in which the malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated. Some liturgiologists base the idea that this Lemuria festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of \\"all the dead\\".For example, Violet Alford (\\"The Cat Saint\\", Folklore 52.3 [September 1941:161–183] p. 181 note 56) observes that \\"Saints were often confounded with the Lares or Dead. Repasts for both were prepared in early Christian times, and All Saints' Day was transferred in 835 to November 1st from one of the days in May which were the old Lemuralia\\"; Alford notes Pierre Saintyves, Les saints successeurs des dieux, Paris 1906 (sic, i.e. 1907). Meanwhile, others consider that 13 May was perhaps deliberately chosen by the Pope because of its celebration already established in the East. The feast of All Saints, on its current date, is traced to the foundation by Pope Gregory III (731–741) of an oratory in St. Peter's for the relics \\"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world\\", with the date moved to and 13 May feast suppressed.\\"All Saints' Day\\", The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd edition, ed. E. A. Livingstone (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), 41–42; The New Catholic Encyclopedia, eo.loc. During the late 8th century, lay religious scholar Alcuin of York used his influence with Charlemagne to introduce the Irish-Northumbrian celebration of the Feast of All Saints to the Frankish Kingdom. In 798, Archbishop Arno of Salzburg called for a festival of all saints on for Southeast Germany, for which he was subsequently commended by Alucin. The All Saints Day was made a day of obligation throughout the Frankish empire in 835, by a decree of Louis the Pious, issued \\"at the instance of Pope Gregory IV and with the assent of all the bishops\\", which confirmed its celebration on . Under the rule of Charlemagne and his successors, the Frankish Kingdom expanded into the Carolingian Empire and subsequently the Holy Roman Empire. The 9th century Félire Óengusso (\\"Martyrology of Óengus\\") by Óengus of Tallaght attests a celebration in Rome for all the saints of Europe as well as a 1 November celebration in Ireland for all saints. Sicard of Cremona, a scholar who lived in the 12th and 13th centuries, proposed that Pope Gregory VII (1073–85) suppressed the feast of May 13 in favor of . By the 12th century, May 13 had been removed from liturgical books. The All Saints octave was added by Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484). Both the All Saints vigil and the octave were suppressed by the reforms of 1955. =Proposed connection to Samhain= Some scholars have proposed that churches in the British Isles began celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century to coincide with or replace the Celtic festival of Samhain. James Frazer represents this school of thought by arguing that 1 November was chosen because Samhain was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead.Pseudo-Bede, Homiliae subdititiae; John Hennig, 'The Meaning of All the Saints', Mediaeval Studies 10 (1948), 147–61.\\"All Saints Day\\", The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd edition, ed. E. A. Livingstone (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), 41–42; The New Catholic Encyclopedia, eo.loc. Ronald Hutton argues instead that the earliest documentary sources indicate that Samhain was a harvest festival with no particular ritual connections to the dead. Hutton proposes that 1 November was a Frankish and Germanic rather than a Celtic cultural referent. =Protestant observances= The festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Anglican Church and in many Lutheran churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden, it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead. In the Swedish calendar, the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and 6 November. In many Lutheran Churches, it is moved to the first Sunday of November. In the Church of England, mother church of the Anglican Communion, it is a Principal Feast and may be celebrated either on 1 November or on the Sunday between 30 October and 5 November. It is also celebrated by other Protestants of the English tradition, such as the United Church of Canada, the Methodist churches and the Wesleyan Church. Protestants generally commemorate all Christians, living and deceased, on All Saints' Day; if they observe All Saints Day at all, they use it to remember all Christians both past and present. In the United Methodist Church, All Saints' Day is celebrated on the first Sunday in November. It is held, not only to remember Saints, but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation. In some congregations, a candle is lit by the Acolyte as each person's name is called out by the clergy. Prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event. Often, the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to a memorial plaque. In many Lutheran churches, All Saints' Day is celebrated the Sunday after Reformation is celebrated (the date for Reformation is 31 October, so Reformation Sunday is celebrated on or before 31 October). In most congregations, the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead. The names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and a bell is tolled, a chime is played or a candle is lit for each name read. While the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on All Saints' Sunday, the festival is ultimately a celebration of Christ's victory over death. In English-speaking countries, services often include the singing of the traditional hymn \\"For All the Saints\\" by Walsham How. The most familiar tune for this hymn is Sine Nomine by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Other hymns that are popularly sung during corporate worship on this day are \\"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\\" and \\"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\\". Customs All Saints' Day at a cemetery in Gniezno, Poland – flowers and candles placed to honor deceased relatives (2017) =Europe= France In France, and throughout the Francophone world, the day is known as La Toussaint. Flowers (especially in Chrysanthemums), or wreaths called 'couronnes de toussaints' are placed at each tomb or grave. The following day, 2 November (All Souls' Day) is called Le jour des morts, the Day of the Dead. Belgium In Belgium, \\"Toussaint\\" or \\"Allerheiligen\\" is a public holiday. Belgians visit the cemeteries to place chrysanthemums on the graves of deceased relatives on All Saints Day, since All Souls is not a holiday. Portugal In Portugal, Dia de Todos os Santos is a national holiday. Families remember their dead with religious observances and visits to the cemetery. Portuguese children celebrate the Pão-por-Deus tradition (also called santorinho, bolinho or fiéis de Deus) going door-to-door, where they receive cakes, nuts, pomegranates, sweets and candies. Spain In Spain, el Día de Todos los Santos is a national holiday. The play Don Juan Tenorio is traditionally performed.\\"All Saints' Day in Spain\\", Estudio Sampere Austria and Bavaria In Austria and Bavaria it is customary on All Saints' Day for godfathers to give their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel, a braided yeast pastry.Berger, Corinna. \\"Your Vienna Guide of All Saints' Day\\", Metropole, 31 October 2017 =The Americas= In Argentina, Brasil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and the state of Louisiana, people take flowers to the graves of dead relatives. Day of the Dead All Saints' Day in Mexico coincides with the first day of the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) celebration. It commemorates children who have died (Dia de los Inocentes) and the second day celebrates all deceased adults.Trebe, Patricia. \\"Mexican- Americans to celebrate Day of the Dead\\", Chicago Tribune, 30 October 2015 Guatemala Sumpango, Guatemala. In Guatemala, All Saints' Day is a national holiday. On that day Guatemalans make a special meal called fiambre which is made of cold meats and vegetables; it is customary to visit cemeteries and to leave some of the fiambre for their dead. It is also customary to fly kites to help unite the dead with the living. There are festivals in towns like Santiago Sacatepéquez and Sumpango, where giant colorful kites are flown.Mijangos, Nelo. \\"All Saints Day in Guatemala\\", Revue, 2 November 2012 Halloween In the United States and Canada, Halloween is celebrated in connection with All Saints' Day, although celebrations are generally limited to 31 October. During the 20th century the observance largely became a secular one, although some Christian groups have continued to embrace the Christian origins of the holiday whereas others (typically Protestant groups) have rejected celebrations.Halloween: What's a Christian to Do? (1998) by Steve Russo.Gyles Brandreth, \\"The Devil is gaining ground\\" The Sunday Telegraph (London), 11 March 2000. On Halloween night, children dress in costumes and go door to door asking for candy in a practice known as trick- or-treating, while adults may host costume parties. There are many popular customs associated with Halloween, including carving a pumpkin into a Jack-o'-lantern and apple bobbing. Halloween is not a public holiday in either the United States or Canada. =Philippines= Hallow-mas in the Philippines is variously called \\"Undás\\", \\"Todos los Santos\\" (Spanish, \\"All Saints\\"), and sometimes \\"Araw ng mga Patay / Yumao\\" (Tagalog, \\"Day of the dead / those who have passed away\\"), which incorporates All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles,\\"All Saints Day around the world\\", Guardian Weekly, 1 November 2010 and food. Chinese Filipinos additionally burn incense and kim. Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery with feasts and merriment. Pangangaluluwa trick-or-treat traditions Though Halloween has usually been seen as an American influence in the Philippines, the country's trick-or- treat traditions during Undas (from the Spanish \\"Honras\\", meaning honours, as in \\"with honors\\") are actually much older. This tradition was derived from the pre-colonial tradition called pangangaluwa. Pangangaluluwa (from \\"kaluluwa\\" or spirit double) was a practice of early Filipinos who sang from house to house swathed in blankets pretending to be ghosts of ancestors. If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the \\"nangangaluluwa\\", the \\"spirits\\" would play tricks (try to steal slippers or other objects left outside the house by members of the family or run off with the owner's chickens). Pangangaluluwa practices are still seen in rural areas. Cemetery and reunion practices During Undas, family members visit the cemetery where the body of the loved ones rest. It is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food, candles, flowers, and sometimes incense sticks, the spirit of the loved one is remembered and appeased. Contrary to common belief, this visitation practice is not an imported tradition. Prior to the establishment of coffins, pre-colonial Filipinos were already practicing such a tradition of visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by a research conducted by the University of the Philippines. The tradition of \\"atang\\" or \\"hain\\" is also practiced, where food and other offerings are placed near the grave site. If the family cannot go to the grave site, a specific area in the house is provided for the offering. The exact date of Undas today, 1 November, is not a pre-colonial observance date but an influence from Mexico, where the same day is known as the Day of the Dead. Pre-colonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswang (half-vampire half-werewolf beings) would take the corpse of the dead if the body was not properly guarded. The protection of the body of the loved one is called \\"paglalamay\\". However, in some communities, this paglalamay tradition is non-existent and is replaced by other pre-colonial traditions unique to each community. The Undas is also seen as a family reunion, where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones. Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations. In some cases, family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people. Fighting in any form is prohibited during Undas. Roles of children Children have important roles during Undas. Children are allowed to play with melted candles in front of grave sites and turn the melted wax from the candles into round wax balls. The round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began, as the living will go back to ash, where everything started. In some cases, families also light candles at the front door of the home. The number of candles is equivalent to the number of departed loved ones. It is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones and provide them with a happy path to the afterlife.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/386063/contemporary- undas-practices-derived-from-pre-colonial-influence-beliefs-cultural- anthropologist/story/ See also * 1755 Lisbon earthquake which occurred on this day and had a great effect on society and philosophy * All Saints' Day, patron saint archive * International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church * Dziady * Irish calendar * Litany of the Saints * Veneration of the dead Notes ;Attribution * Further reading * Langgärtner, Georg. \\"All Saints' Day\\".

Early life Purves was born in Edmonton on October 18, 1933. He grew up in the city's Calder, Pigeon Lake, Norwood, Riverdale, and Lavigne (now known as Skunk Hollow) areas and went to Victoria High School and Strathcona High School and finished in 1950. On December 29, 1956 he married Clare Heller, with whom he have four daughters, Cindy, Corinne, Caroline and Catherine. He worked for the Dominion Bank from 1950 until 1959, and worked for his family's upholstering firm, Apex Auto Upholstering, from 1959 until 1988. Purves is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Purves was a convert to the Church. Purves has served as a bishop in the Church and was the first Edmonton-born man to serve as a bishop in the Church in Edmonton.Roy Prete, ed. Canadian Mormons (Salt Lake City, Deseret Book, 2017), p. 303-304 Political career Purves' first bid for political office took place during the 1964 municipal election, when he ran unsuccessfully for Protestant school trustee. He finished eleventh of twenty-one candidates; the top seven were elected. He ran for Edmonton City Council instead in the 1966 election, and was elected as one of twelve aldermen, finishing ninth of thirty-two candidates. He was re-elected in the 1968 election, finishing fifth out of thirty-two candidates. While still in office, he sought the Social Credit nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona for the 1971 provincial election, but was defeated by Strathcona Centre incumbent Joseph Donovan Ross (who was defeated in the general election by Progressive Conservative Julian Koziak). In the 1971 election, Edmonton was for the first time divided into aldermanic wards; three aldermen would be elected from each of the four wards. Purves ran in Ward 2, and finished first out of eleven candidates. In the 1974 election, Purves ran for mayor, challenging incumbent Ivor Dent. He defeated Dent, but so did William Hawrelak, who received more than twice as many votes as Purves. Hawrelak died in office and was replaced by alderman Terry Cavanagh, who Purves challenged for mayor in the 1977 election. In winning, he beat not only Cavanagh (who finished third) but Dent (who finished fourth) and future mayor Laurence Decore (who finished second). Purves faced no serious opposition to his 1980 re-election bid, and won more than seventy percent of the vote. Some of the highlights of Purves' terms as mayor were the 1978 Commonwealth Games and the accompanying opening of Commonwealth Stadium. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip with two of their sons, Andrew and Edward opened the Games. It was a huge success internationally. In 1979, Edmontonians voted to proceed with the construction of a convention center rejecting a ballot measure that would have halted the proposal. Purves was a public supporter of building the center and saw to its completion in 1983 despite much opposition. Ed Zemrau approached Purves to get his support for a bid for the University Games. He met with President Meyer Horowitz and they agreed that it would be a good thing for Edmonton and the University of Alberta (located in Edmonton) as the facilities were in place. They proceeded to make a bid for the 1983 Games and were successful. The Games were another feather in the cap for Edmontonian's who made it a tremendous success. Prince Charles & Princess Dianne attended as sponsors and opened the games which was exciting for Edmontonians. Purves also opened the first leg of LRT and during office started the extension of this transportation system to the Government center and finished it. Purves introduced a debt reduction program in 1981 for the city which the council adopted. The city won accolades in the following years for its fiscal plans. Purves continued to push for major roadways throughout the city. He was concerned about the city's long term future and presented the government with an annexation proposal. The government announced the proposal would have to go through the Local Authorities Board which the city did. The mayor always stated it was a political decision and the government should make it. In the end after many thousands of dollars being spent and untold hours in meetings and doing research it was finished and the LAB Board presented it to cabinet without publicly giving their decision and it was taken to cabinet where they made a political decision. This was largest annexation in the history of city but it was poorly done by the government. This created and would problems in the future. Also under Purves' leadership the city built a modern downtown Police Station. He appointed the first Auditor General for City of Edmonton. Another appointment by Purves was of Fred Windwick to lead the celebration of Edmonton's 75th anniversary which was a great success. Purves also worked with the Provincial Government to come up with a gift to the Province which would be a part of the Government for years to come. A speakers canopy was approved by the Government and Speaker of the House and was built by City employees. It is a magnificent piece of art, which Purves presented formally to the Government at a ceremony at the legislature. Purves worked with the Kinsmen to build Kinsman Field House with opposition from Parks and Rec as they felt since it was on city property they should run it. Purves continued to fight for the preservation of the river valley. Under his leadership the city acquired close to 70% of the properties in Rossdale. Purves worked with the Alberta Government on the development of Capital City Recreation Park . He also continued to push the Provincial Government to assist in financing the construction of ring roads. He also fought and won the fight with the Federal Government on closing the municipal airport. The airport was a very important part of the city's development and was a great communication center for the. Purves was defeated in the 1983 election by Decore, who received more than twice as many votes as the incumbent. He did not seek to re-enter politics thereafter. Retirement and extra-political involvement Purves served as a member of the St. Joseph's Hospital board, the Edmonton Police Commission, the Greater Edmonton Foundation board, the Edmonton Public Library board, the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, and the Edmonton Symphony Society board. He was at various times a member of the Edmonton Exhibition Association, and President of the Edmonton Jaycees in 1962. Je also received the Jaycees Senate Award. He was also chosen twice as one of the 10 outstanding young men in Alberta by the Alberta Jaycees. (a young mens international organization). Purves was called as a bishop of a ward of The Church of Jesus, Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1974 and served until 1977. He served in many other positions within the church over the years. Purves served on the Edmonton chapter of The Canadian Mental health Association and become President. He filed for bankruptcy on March 29, 1988.

It runs in a southwest-to-northeast direction, from the main gate of Naval Base Guam in the western community of Santa Rita in a general northeasterly direction to the main gate of Andersen Air Force Base in the community of Yigo. It passes through Guam's capital, Hagåtña, as well as intersecting various other territorial highways. Along its route, the highway runs through tropical forest areas, urbanized commercial areas, and residential neighborhoods. The US Military built the road starting in 1941. Construction ceased with the Japanese invasion in December 1941 and resumed in 1944. The highway was formally dedicated to the US Marines by the territorial governor in 2004. Route description GH-1 begins near the entrance gate to Naval Base Guam, at a junction with GH-2A. Known as Marine Corps Drive, the route then travels to the northeast through tropical forests along Apra Harbor to the town of Piti. After passing through Piti, the drive runs along Tepungon Beach before turning inland near Asan Point. The road passes the US Naval Hospital and Asan Point; then it runs parallel to the coast along Asan Memorial Beach through the community of Asan. Soon thereafter, Marine Corps Drive cuts a path due east towards the Island's capital, Hagåtña where it passes through the northern edge of the city. In this area, GH-1 runs through commercial areas parallel to the West Agaña Beach Front area. The drive passes the Paseo de Susana before following Trinchera Beach northeasterly through town. Marine Corps Drive on Guam After passing through the capital and the community of Mongmong, the road turns towards the northeast as it skirts to the west of Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on its way through the village of Tamuning. After the airport, the highway runs inland from the shoreline through the neighborhood of Tumon. It runs northeasterly around the Micronesia Mall before turning southeasterly through residential areas as it cuts across the southern edges of Dededo. It runs to the south of the Guam International Country Club and to the north of the Andersen Air Force Base's southern unit. Through this area, the north side of the highway is residential areas, and the south side is tropical forests. Marine Corps Drive passes the War Dead Cemetery and turns northeasterly residential areas on both sides of the roadway through Yigo before reaching its terminus at Salisbury Junction, the main entrance to the Air Force Base, where the road continues to the northwest as GH-9. Like most major highways on Guam, a speed limit is posted throughout most of its length. In the past, GH-1 was one of the few roads to post a limit on lengths of less-developed roadway. However, as more of the area became developed, certain sections of the roads were posted with lower limits. Travelers heading north away from the developed areas are allowed a speed limit. However, the southbound lanes on the same sections remain posted at due to development on the western side of the road. History The United States Military began to develop and construct roads on the island in 1941. Some roads had existed prior to this, but improvements were beginning to take shape. Only one road, which encircled most of the island, had been graded. It was the primary route linking Agana (the name of the capital at the time) to Piti and Asan. This was the foundation for Marine Corps Drive. After the Japanese invasion, little infrastructure improvements were made by the occupiers. Road construction resumed by the US Military after the island was invaded in 1944. In 60 days, a , four-lane super-highway with nine bridges was built after the invasion. The remainder of the roadway was built and numbered under the local administration after Guam was given civil government in 1950. Named Marine Corps Drive throughout its length, it was known as simply Marine Drive until the road was rededicated by Governor Felix Perez Camacho in 2004. In 2012, the DPW has started to install LED streetlights along Marine Corps Drive. At the same time, construction has started to replace the Agana Bridge along GH-1.

It is the primary settlement in the town and had a population of 123 at the 2010 census. The village center and surrounding area are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Center Sandwich Historic District. The village is home of the Sandwich Fair, held annually in early October. History Center Sandwich began as the site of an early gristmill, erected in 1768 by Daniel Beede, which was followed in 1780 by a sawmill, both on the banks of the Red Hill River. Roads were then built to the area, and the village and surrounding rural parts of town grew from about 900 people in 1790 to over 2,000 in 1820. Most of the village's development and growth occurred in the years before the Civil War, resulting in residential and civic buildings that are largely vernacular Federal and Greek Revival in style. Because no railroads were built to serve the area, Center Sandwich declined in importance after the Civil War. Only a small number of changes occurred in the village in the 20th century. The oldest surviving building in the village is the 1792 Baptist church, originally Federal in style, but later given Greek Revival features.

Troubled by illness throughout his life, Sederholm originally chose to study geology to allow him to work outdoors. After studying first in Helsinki (where he was a student of Fredrik Johan Wiik), then in Stockholm and Heidelberg, Sederholm returned to Finland to work for the Geological Survey of Finland. In 1893 he assumed the role of director of this institution, a post he occupied until his death forty years later. Working on local Precambrian basement rocks, Sederholm instigated a map-making programme that, between 1899 and 1925, published many maps and descriptions of their geological history. Gneisses in the areas he studied (the so-called Baltic Shield) were often of mixed composition, with layers of granitic rock being interleaved with metamorphic rock. Sederholm termed these as migmatites, and viewed them as the product of the intrusion of igneous magma into metamorphic rocks at depth. During his career Sederholm received both the Murchison Medal from the Geological Society of London (1928) and the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America (also 1928). The mineral sederholmite is named in his honour. Aside from his geological work, Sederholm was a member of the Diet of Finland, and undertook missions from this to the League of Nations. He was also a member and chairman (twice) of the Economic Society of Finland. In the 1974 historical novel Centennial, James Michener listed Sederholm among those scientists who made early estimates of the age of the Earth. Sederholm's estimate was 40 million years.

The Galeanos, however, fell out of favor with Escobar, who ordered them killed in 1992. Murillo managed to survive and then joined Los Pepes, an organization headed by the Castaño brothers, Carlos and Fidel to counter Escobar. He also managed to gain control over the illegal businesses controlled by the Galeanos in Itagüí, including the Oficina de Envigado. Soon, Murillo had become the leader of the many criminal and hitmen gangs in Medellín, particularly the fearsome La Terraza, which was involved in theft, blackmail, extortion, assassination, kidnapping, and drug traffic. Around the year 2000, however, members of La Terraza rebelled against Murillo and started a war against him. By then, Murillo had become well acquainted with the Castaño brothers and had also become the commander of two paramilitary blocs, the Cacique Nutibara Bloc and the Granada Heroes Bloc. He also gained control over much of the drug traffic in the area. He became third in the chain of command of the AUC and a key player during the peace process in Santa Fe de Ralito, Córdoba between his organization and the government of Colombia, and he demobilized in November, 2003. However, in 2005 he was accused by a court of being responsible for the death of a deputy. He then escaped from Santa Fe de Ralito and surrendered to authorities four days later.  Extradition to the United States  In the early morning of May 13, 2008, Murillo Bejarano and 13 other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government. According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holguín, they refused to comply with the country's Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Many critics argued that this action would actually be favorable to the criminal as he would only be charged for drug trafficking in the United States, as opposed to being charged for his many murders and other illegal activities in Colombia. The next day, Don Berna pleaded not guilty to money laundering and drug trafficking charges filed by United States (federal) prosecutors of the Southern District of New York State. The judge ruled the trial would begin September 16, 2008. On June 17, 2008, he pleaded guilty to trafficking tons of cocaine. His lawyers and prosecutors agreed that he would be sentenced from 324 months to 405 months in prison. The sentence was determined on December 18, 2008. The acting director of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration said, \\"American and Colombian communities are safer with the removal of this notorious drug kingpin.\\" On April 22, 2009, Don Berna was sentenced to 376 months (31 years 4 months) in prison and fined $4 million USD. The National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several organizations of victims who suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked for the \\"return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures\\".Extradition Cut Short CCAJAR May 27, 2008 The Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated: \\"according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the 'Law of Justice and Peace' and for the loss of the benefits established therein\\". The Inter-American Commission stated that this \\"affects the Colombian State's obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system's regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\\"  In popular culture  His character is played by Mauricio Cujar on the Netflix show Narcos.

Built as a new capital ship meant to improve on the very successful Océan class, while avoiding the weaknesses found on Valmy, she retained most of the Océan's design, and incorporated the philosophy of \\"fast ship of the line\\" pioneered by Napoléon, with a rounded stern and a two-cylinder, 8-boiler steam engine allowing her a speed of 13.5 knots. The propeller could be retracted to streamline the hull when sailing under sail only. Launched in 1855, she was too late to take part in the Crimean War. She was decommissioned in 1865, becoming a schoolship for boys and sailors in Brest. Struck from the Navy lists in 1880, she was broken up that year.  Design and construction  Bretagne was the offspring of an attempt to improve upon the Océan class by increasing the beam from 16.24 to 16.64 metres. The 1849 budget initially allowed for construction of a new three-decker capital ship named Terrible in Brest, but the ship was cancelled in 1848 to slim down expenses. The 1850 budget then scheduled two ships, named Bretagne and Desaix (in honour of Louis Desaix), to be built in Brest and Cherbourg respectively; the order was placed on 15 March 1851. The mediocre performances of Valmy during her trials led to the Navy shedding the capital ship design of the Commission de Paris and start back from Sané's Océan design, with only incremental modifications. In late 1851, engineers De Gasté, responsible for Bretagne, and Forquenot, for Desaix, decided on a reduction of the tumblehome by 20 centimetres and on a slight increase of the beam — alterations thought safe, as the two last ships of the Océan design, Ville de Paris and Louis-XIV, had had their tumblehome reduced by 23 centimetres with no ill effect. An initial suggestion to fit the ships with 160 shp steam engines allowing for a speed of 4,5 knots was declined as to minimise departures from Sané's design. Bretagne under construction in Brest arsenal. Engraving in L'Illustration. Bretagne was laid down on 4 August 1851 and Desaix on 27 Octobre. On 17 June 1852, the Ministry of the Navy suspended construction and required that the ships be lengthened by 3.43 metres and that 540 shp steam engines be incorporated. Brest responded to the requirements in September 1852, but at the same point, Dupuy de Lôme's fast ship of the line Napoléon was completing her trials, exhibiting such outstanding performances that on 10 September 1852 the Ministry cancelled the Bretagne class and ordered existing sailing ships to be converted to steamers, using as many existing parts as possible. At this point, the keel, bow and aft of Bretagne had been erected, amounting to the third of the 24 construction steps defined by regulations in ship construction; she was taken apart and rebuilt according to Marielle's plans, which had been approved in December 1852. At the same time, the order for the steam engine was placed. Desaix, whose keel was only beginning to be laid, was cancelled altogether and Arcole, second ship of the Algésiras type, the production series of the Napoléon design, was started instead. Launching of Bretagne took place on 17 February 1855; in spite of a 2 °C, snow and strong wind, a large populace gathered to watch the operation. The new design gave a length of 81 metres and a beam of 18.08; this made Bretagne 8 metres longer and 2 metres wider than Napoléon. With a draught of 8.35 metre, the ship had a volume of just under 20 000 m³. The engine, provided by the Indret workshop, occupied a 30-metre long compartment and was designed for 1200 shp but could develop up to 3327 shp in peak power from eight boilers, each with six furnaces. Though direct transmission by an axis, it moved a four-blade, 6.3-metre propeller which could be retracted into a vertical shaft, only 1.3 metre wide thanks to the geometry of the blades. The ship carried 590 tonnes of coal, giving her an autonomy of 14 days at 10 knots, and 6 days at her top speed of 14 knots. With three month worth of food for the 1200-man complement, and one month worth fresh water completed by a distillation device to desalinate seawater, she could stay at sea for 40 days. The main battery of Bretagne used 36-pounder long guns, the heaviest available calibre, instead of the more modern 30-pounder long gun on which other ships standardised their armament. The aft of the ship was round and featured gun ports, like on Napoléon on her successors. Although she carried 130 guns of various calibres, Bretagne featured no less than 180 gun ports; this allowed the crew to reinforce the artillery on one arc if needed and time permitting, such as before a shore bombardment, and fire up to 80 guns on one target. The figurehead figured the prophet Veleda, an important character in the folklore of Bretagne, with a sickle in hand and a wearing an oak leaf crown. The transom featured the coat of arms of Bretagne, carried by two geniī, and the name of the ship underneath. The ship was painted in black, with white stripes along the level of the gunports and copper-red paint underwater. As completed, Bretagne proved much heavier than anticipated: designed to displace 6466 tonnes for an 8.20-metre draught, she actually displaced 6873, yielding a 9-metre draught that lowered the lower battery to only 1.45 meters above water, instead of the intended 1.75 metres. Daguerreotype of Bretagne in Brest, circa 1860 The ultimate increase in French capital ship design, Bretagne increased the number of heavy guns on the lower battery to 18 on each side, from the 15 of the Bretagne of 1766 and 16 on the Océans. In the original design, half of these guns were 36-pounder long guns, as to maximise firepower at the price of standardisation on 30-pounder long guns that typically prevailed at the time, the other half being 60-pounder Paixhans guns. The middle deck fielded 18 30-pounder short guns and another 18 Paixhans guns of 60 pounds. The upper battery was armed with 38 30-pounder howitzers. Two 50-pounders and 18 30-pounder caronades complemented the armament on the deck. This gave Bretagne a broadside of 2924 pounds (1431 kilogrammes), compared to the 2400 of the original Océan design. In 1869, after the ship became a school ship for the École Navale, this armament was replaced with 2 rifled 19 cm guns on the lower deck; 16 30-pounder guns, 4 riffled 16-centimetre guns of the 1864 pattern, 8 riffled 16-centimetre guns modified after the 1860 or the 1862 pattern, 2 muzzle-loading 16-centimetre riffled guns, and 2 14-centimetre guns on the middle battery; and 2 bronze 12-centimetre guns on the deck.  Operational history  Completed two years after her British homologue HMS Duke of Wellington, Bretagne became the most powerful warship in the world, but commissioned too late to effectively take part in the Crimean War, which was almost over after the fall of Kinburn in October 1855. Appointed flagship of the Toulon squadron in January 1856, she sailed to the Black Sea to serve during the last months of the conflict, which came to an end in July, and helped return the French expeditionary corps back to France. She was then part of the training squadron in Toulon, cruising between Sardinia and Spain. Bretagne saluting Queen Victoria in Cherbourg. Painting by Léon Morel-Fatio. Bretagne took part in the naval parade given in honour of Queen Victoria by Napoléon III in Cherbourg Roads on 5 August 1858. The French Emperor intended to prove to the British that the recent improvements to Cherbourg military harbour were not meant as a threat to Great Britain, and invited the British monarch, Prince Albert and a large British delegation to visit the installations, as a token of good faith. The visit was counter-productive, as the display of power of the French fleet, compounded by bouts of diplomatic clumsiness such as inaugurating an equestrian statue of Napoléon I, irritated and worried the British.Napoleon III Receiving Queen Victoria at Cherbourg, 5 août 1858 After the British delegation departed in haste, Bretagne took the French Emperor and Empress aboard and ferried them to Brest for the next leg of their official tour. Bretagne served as a troopship during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, and a few months later the led the bombing of Tétouan forts in Morocco, where a cannonball hit her hull. In 1860, she sailed to Napoli for the funeral of Prince Jérôme Napoléon. She then sailed to Gaeta in October, under Admiral Adelbert Lebarbier de Tinan, to oppose a Sardinian attack against Napolitan forces, leading to the Battle of Garigliano. She spend most of 1861 ferrying French troops deployed in Syria back to France, before returning to Toulon. In 1865, Bretagne was transformed into a schoolship for boys and sailors, leading to the removal of her engine. In 1869, the artillery was replaced by an assortment of various types of guns for didactic purpose. The 30-gun corvette Galathée served as her tender. On 28 January 1880, Bretagne was struck for the Navy lists and renamed Ville de Bordeaux, exchanging her name and equipment with Ville de Bordeaux, and was towed to Landévennec to be broken up.

The village is south of Devizes and lies on the A360 which links Devizes to Salisbury. The civil parish includes the hamlet of Potterne Wick.  History  Domesday Book of 1086 recorded three landholdings at Poterne, with six mills and a large population of 107 households. The ancient parish consisted of the tithings of Potterne, Worton, and Marston. Worton and Marston were made into a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852, and two civil parishes in 1894. Local government and services The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service have their control centre on the outskirts of the village, in the grounds of the manor house. Prior to the amalgamation of the Dorset and Wiltshire services in 2016, the manor house (a late 18th century building, extended 1888–9) was the headquarters of Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service. The house was offered for sale in 2017.  Parish church  St Mary's Church A priest, and land held by the Bishop of Salisbury, was recorded at Potterne in Domesday Book of 1086. The Church of England parish church of St Mary was built in the 13th century and has survived with little change, beyond work to the tower in the 15th century and restoration by Ewan Christian. Pevsner describes it as \\"An Early English parish church of exceptional purity and indeed classicity\\" and linked this to the Bishops' ownership of the manor. The church is cruciform, with a substantial tower over the crossing, and original lancet windows. It is built of rubble stone, with ashlar to the upper tower. The south porch was added in the 14th century, and in the 15th the tower was made higher and given an elaborate battlement. Restoration in 1870–2 included re-roofing and the removal of galleries, and the stained glass is from various dates in that century. The tower has six bells, the oldest cast by William I Purdue c. 1580. The octagonal font and most of the oak pulpit are from the 15th century; A 10th-century font was found during the 1872 restoration and now stands at the west end of the nave. The organ was built in 1723 by Jordan of London and recased in 1938. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1962. Since the 11th century, the church has been linked to All Saints at West Lavington as tithes from both churches endow a prebendary at Salisbury Cathedral. From 1967 the benefice was held in plurality with Worton and since 2017 the parish has been part of the Wellsprings benefice, which extends to Seend, Bulkington and Poulshot. Notable buildings * Porch House, a timber- framed house on the High Street, built c.1480. Bought in 1870 by artist George Richmond, who restored it with advice from Ewan Christian. Grade I listed. \\"Remarkably well preserved\\" (Pevsner). * The Red House, c.1700, a two-storey garden building for Walter Grubbe MP at Eastwell House, Grade II*. * Whistley House, c.1730, a country house northwest of the village, Grade II*. =Blount's Court= A medieval part of what is now Potterne was the manor of Blount's Court, which probably originated in the 13th century. By 1953, the house and property now known as Blount's Court had been owned by the Stancomb family since 1809, when William Stancomb started building the house, for which he revived the ancient name. His son William died in 1941 at the age of 90. Blount's Court, which is now divided into flats, is a large 19th Century 'gothic' building with a porch carried up as a battlemented tower. The centre block is of three stories, the wings are of two. The windows are squareheaded, mullioned, and transomed, the parapets battlemented. Blount's Court is also the name given to the suburban public street, of about 100 houses, leading up to the private property surrounding the block of flats. Amenities The village has a shop with a post office, a village hall, a youth club, a playing field and a park. There is one pub, the George & Dragon. There is a preschool and a primary school (Five Lanes CE VC Primary School) which has two sites: for younger children at Potterne and for older children in the nearby village of Worton. Wiltshire Scouts have their Wiltshire Scout Centre, with six campgrounds, near Potterne Wick. Potterne Cricket Club, founded as part of the village sports team in 1936, play in the West of England Premier League and Wiltshire County Cricket League. =The Potterne Mummers= The village is home to the Potterne Mummers, who re-enact performances of a traditional mummers play during the week before Christmas in pubs around the Devizes area and ending each year with a performance at the George and Dragon and Potterne social club on Christmas Eve. The Mummers were founded in 1953 by Bernard Baker, a local schoolteacher, who brought together a group to perform a local mummer's play which he had found from an archive report from the late nineteenth century. The initial revival of the play only lasted one year; it was performed by Potterne teenagers under the direction of Bernard Baker. In 1976 the cast included Nigel Weeks as Valiant Soldier, and it was next performed in 1972, with a cast which included Mick Hiscock. It has been performed every year since and is a firm annual tradition and the cast, still including Mick Hiscock, put on their tatter coats and tour the pubs collecting money for various charities including the Wiltshire Air Ambulance. The Potterne Mummers were presented to Prince Philip in 2012 at the Queen's Jubilee event at Salisbury Cathedral and were shortlisted for a Community Service award in 2014.

The principal reason for such clauses is to minimise conflict between the insured and the insurer. The insurer will often wish to settle claims as quickly and cheaply as possible, but the insured may be concerned that paying on a claim implies negligence which will damage their professional reputation, and want to contest the claim regardless. Professional indemnity policies commonly provide that the insurer will pay the legal costs of the defence. It is sometimes suggested that the clause is also designed to protect the public from the unjustified contesting of claims which have no real defence, but this may represent a charitable view of the way insurance companies conduct claims. Conflicts between the insurer and insured can put a solicitor who represents both in an invidious position, particularly where the solicitor has received confidential information from one party, and may result in multiplicity of legal representation. In practice however, there is an enormous reluctance to invoke such clauses, partly because of the expense of instructing Queen's Counsel to advise, and partly because of the insurer's need to maintain good relations with the insured. Although still called QC clauses, such clauses often provide that the advice of a junior barrister of a certain seniority may be taken. Some general liability policies contain a converse version the traditional QC clause; viz., that the insurer does not need to pay out on a claim against the insured unless a Queen's Counsel advises that there is no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the claim. QC clauses were considered judicially by Lord Devlin (in relation to another issue) in West Wake Price & Co v Ching [1956] 3 All ER 821.

Richard Hertwig was the younger brother of Oscar Hertwig, who also analyzed zygote formation. The two Hertwig brothers worked together until 1883 (more at: Oscar Hertwig). The Hertwig brothers were the most eminent scholars of Ernst Haeckel (and Carl Gegenbaur), each brother becoming a long-term professor in Germany. They were independent of Haeckel's philosophical speculations but took his ideas in a positive way to widen their concepts in zoology. Initially, between 1879–1883, they worked together and performed embryological studies, especially on the theory of the coelom (1881). These problems were based on the phylogenetic theorems of Haeckel, specifically, the biogenic theory () and the \\"gastraea theory\\" of Haeckel. Within 10 years, the two brothers moved apart to the north and south of Germany. Richard's brother Oscar later became a professor of anatomy in 1888 in Berlin; however, Richard Hertwig had moved 3 years prior, becoming a professor of zoology in Munich from 1885–1925, at Ludwig Maximilians University, where he served the last 40 years of his 50-year career as a professor at 4 universities. The later research of Richard Hertwig focused on protists (with the relationship between the nucleus and the plasma = \\"Kern-Plasma-Relation\\"), as well as on developmental physiological studies on sea urchins and frogs. Richard Hertwig also wrote a leading textbook of zoology, published in 1891, which he kept up to date through 15 editions until 1931.  Life  Hertwig was born in Friedberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He began studying medicine at the University of Jena, and under the influence of professor Ernst Haeckel (16 years older), he shifted his interest more to zoology and biology. In 1872, he received a doctorate at the University of Bonn and worked there as an assistant to anatomist Max Schultze. In 1875, he moved to the University of Jena in the Department of Zoology, and in 1878, Hertwig became extraordinary professor there. As a successor of Franz Hermann Troschel, Richard Hertwig was appointed in 1881 to the University of Königsberg as a professor of zoology. In 1883, he moved to the same role as professor at the University of Bonn, where he remained only a short while, however, since in 1885, he was called to the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, where Hertwig remained until 1925, also working as head of the zoological collection of the state of Bavaria (now Zoologische Staatssammlung München) and as director of the zoological institute which he developed into a leading centre of biological science. Hertwig belonged to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, beginning in 1885 as an extraordinary member, and from 1889 as a full member. In 1909, he received the title Ritter von. Hertwig died on 3 October 1937 in Schlederloh, Germany. His pupil Otto Koehler became one of the founders of Ethology in Germany. Another of his students, Ivan Buresh, was a leading Bulgarian natural scientist. His student Rhoda Erdmann was well-known for her studies of invertebrates and cancer and was a pioneer in the field of tissue culture. She founded and led the Institute of Experimental Cytology at the University of Berlin. She also was the founder and editor of the journal \\"Archiv fur Experimentelle Zellforschung.\\"  Research  At the beginning of his career, Richard Hertwig worked along with his brother, Oscar Hertwig. Together they developed, in 1881, the Coelom Theory (German: \\"Coelomtheorie\\"), of the fluid- filled body cavity (the \\"coelom\\"), as an explanation of the middle Keimblatt, which brought important realizations in the field of embryology. The theory assumes that all organs and tissues develop differently from three primary tissue layers, during animal embryogenesis. Hertwig worked systematically on several groups of protozoa and metazoa (German: Wirbellose) and provided fundamental work on the development of animals. His contributions are most well known to protozoa research. Hertwig, on the basis of examining sea urchins, discovered and explained the zygote fertilization process for the first time correctly as a fusion of egg and spermatozoon (sperm cell) penetrating the egg membrane.

Dr. Claudette Crawford-Brown, the University of the West Indies academic who first described the phenomenon of barrel children, defines \\"barrel children\\" as those children who, while waiting in the Caribbean to migrate to their parents in the metropoles of North America and the United Kingdom, receive material resources in the form of food and clothing in lieu of direct care. Dr. Crawford-Brown, in her publication Who will save our children: The plight of the Jamaican child in the nineties, showed that these children have surrogate parents who are often unable to give them the emotional support and nurturance that they need, most of these children may be instead raised by grandparents or close relatives.Crawford-Brown, C. (1999). Who will save our children: The plight of the Jamaican child in the nineties. Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press Emotional impact The impact on these children of this type of neglect includes a range of emotional and behavioural problems including run- away behaviour, withdrawal, depression, and, in some cases, acting-out behaviour. The Trinidad and Tobago News said that for \\"barrel children the psychological scars have been great and have been troubling factors unto the second, third and fourth generations.\\" The Wellcome Trust discussed barrel children in an article focusing on violence in the Caribbean while it was the title and subject of a short film by Cara Elmslie Weir about a Trinidadian family split by migration, the parents \\"sending barrels full of material goods\\" from the US to their children in Trinidad. UNICEF in Jamaica agreed that \\"Migration of parents who seek more lucrative employment abroad has had a negative impact on Jamaican children. Some children are left in the care of strangers, neighbours or even older siblings who are still children. These so- called “barrel children” are left without parental guidance or adult supervision and with access to significant material resources in the form of cash remittances and barrels of clothing and toys sent by absentee parents.\\" It has also been discussed in Caribbean Studies Journals,Anthurium: A Caribbean Studies Journal - V2I1 - Down, Navigating the Web of Place conferences on the Caribbean, the Trinidad Guardian The Trinidad Guardian -Online Edition Ver 2.0 and Trinidad Newsday. Discussing absent parents The Trinidad Guardian noted that \\"At holiday time, they ship their barrels of love, disguised as brand-name sneakers and clothing, believing that these would make their children happy and make up for them being not around. But the fact remains that children are deprived of the real love of their parents.\\" Reportage An article published in Newsweek by Brook Larmar entitled the \\"Barrel Children\\" dramatised the problem in its effects on one particular family. \\"The cardboard barrel has been sitting empty in Marsha Flowers's backyard for more than a month now, but the Jamaican teenager hangs onto it as though it were a sacred totem. And in a way, it is. Five years after her mother immigrated to the United States, leaving Marsha and two sisters to fend for themselves in a Kingston slum, the barrel is one of the few tangible signs of her mother's love - and of her own frustrated desires.\\" Blogs also exist highlighting the experiences of barrel children.
