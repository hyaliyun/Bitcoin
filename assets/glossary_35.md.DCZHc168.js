The Lighthouse Board chose to use a design that had been used on McGulpin Point Light in 1868; Eagle Harbor Light in 1871; and White River Light in 1875.Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Sand Island Light. Currently owned by the National Park Service and part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, part of reference number 77000145. Listed in the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey, WI-313. Attached to the lighthouse is a Norman gothic keepers quarters. History In 1871, the Lighthouse Board asked Congress for funds to construct a lighthouse on Sand Island to both better guide ships toward the Raspberry Island Light and mark the Western edge of the Apostle Islands. However, Congress rejected the request for this and the next six years. In 1880, Congress finally agreed to erect a lighthouse, and sent an engineer to begin planning for the construction of the station. Sand Island Light was built from the same designs as three other lighthouses, but with the local Apostle Islands Brownstone instead of brick. The masons opened a hole for the cellar, and then began building the dwelling, and added the tower in the Western corner of the structure. As the lighthouse neared completion, a fixed white Fourth Order Fresnel lens was placed in the lantern room. An acting keeper was appointed, and the light was first lit on September 25, 1881. The acting keeper, Charles Lederle, was appointed permanent keeper the next year. Eventually, Lederle grew weary of the isolation that came with being the keeper of an island lighthouse and was reappointed the keeper of Two Harbors Light in Minnesota. The first assistant on nearby Outer Island, Emmanuel Luick, was offered the position of keeper at the Sand Island Light, and moved in with his wife Ella during January 1892. In 1901, Luick fell ill, leaving all duties at the lighthouse for Ella. Although she managed to do everything, the incident pointed out the dangers of having a single keeper on Sand Island. The Lighthouse Board authorized the addition of an assistant keeper and on May 22, 1902, Henry Irvine moved onto the island. In October 1903, Irvine was transferred to Devils Island. Luick appointed his wife as his acting assistant keeper, but the following day Edward Derry arrived on the island as the new assistant keeper. On April 30, 1904, Derry resigned, leaving Ella as acting assistant keeper once again. Ten days later, Frederick Hudson arrived on the island to take over as assistant keeper. On May 9, 1905, Ella boarded a steamer for nearby Bayfield and never returned to the island or her husband again. Luick married again, this time to a woman named Oramill, and with her served the Sand Island Light for the next sixteen years. Over the course of that time, Luick went through twelve assistants, with the longest tenure being only two years. By the end of the 1910s, local shipping patterns had changing, and the Sand Island Light became less important. In 1921, the Lighthouse Board automated the tower, and Luick was reassigned to Grand Marais Light in Minnesota. In 1933, the automated light was dismantled, and the Coast Guard constructed a steel tower in front of the lighthouse. The automated light was placed on top until 1985, when the light was placed back in the lighthouse and the tower was removed.

He was the pioneer Executive Chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the government commission tasked with countering corruption and fraud. In April 2009, he became a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development. He lived in exile until 2010 when he returned to Nigeria and declared his intention to run for President of Nigeria under the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). On Friday, 14 January 2011, Nuhu Ribadu was adopted as the presidential candidate of the ACN. In August 2014, he defected to the ruling party PDP with the intention to run for the Governorship of Adamawa State, North East Nigeria. Education Ribadu studied law at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Kaduna State from 1980 until 1983, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree. Following a year at the Nigerian Law School, he was called to Bar in 1984. He also earned a Master of Laws degree from the same university. He is a TED Fellow and a Senior Fellow in St. Antony's College, University of Oxford, UK. Corruption and the EFCC The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, appointed him to the chairmanship of the EFCC in 2003 and reappointed him in 2007, as well as promoting him to the position of Assistant Inspector General of Police. The promotion on 9 April 2007, three weeks before newly elected President Umaru Yar'Adua was sworn-in, was later challenged on the basis that it was \\"illegal, unconstitutional, null and void, and of no legal effect.\\" In December 2007, Mike Okiro, Inspector-General of Police, stated that Ribadu would be removed as EFCC chairman for a one-year training course. Career in law enforcement On 20 October 2006, Nuhu Ribadu told the BBC that over 380 billion dollars had been stolen or wasted by Nigerian governments since independence in 1960. Under Ribadu's administration, the EFCC charged prominent bankers, former State governors, ministers, Senators, high-ranking political party members, commissioners of Police, and advance fee fraud (\\"419\\") gang operators. The EFCC issued thousands of indictments and achieved about 270 convictions. One notable case was that of his boss, the then Inspector-General of the Nigerian Police Force, Mr Tafa Balogun, who was convicted, jailed and made to return £150 million under a plea bargain. Ribadu's achievements in the EFCC included the de-listing of Nigeria from the FATF List of Non-Cooperative Countries & Territories, admission into the prestigious Egmont Group and the withdrawal of the US Treasury FINCEN Advisory on Nigeria. They helped make the EFCC the foremost Anti-Corruption Enforcement Agency on the continent, cementing Ribadu's reputation in the world as a respected anti-corruption crusader. Nuhu Ribadu's evidence helped prosecute foreign businesses who offered bribes while doing business in Nigeria. Ribadu has however been accused of double standard and insincerity in his war against corruption. Many observed that Ribadu went after perceived enemies of his boss, Obasanjo, while shielding the friends of the former president. Notable among his critics is radical Lagos lawyer, Fetus Keyamo who described the withdrawal of charges against Ribadu as totally wrong, very insensitive, entirely unwise and ill-advised. So far, none of the accusations of corruption have been substantiated. Several newspapers that have led in the criticism of Ribadu are owned by individuals who were facing corruption charges. Ribadu regularly inspires youths to become the change they seek. At the fourth edition of \\"Project Mentor-Me\\" organised by Group of Patriotic Corpers (GPC), a non-profit group in Abuja, he got the audience to take a critical look at their life choices and how it shapes their future. He was supported by Blossom Nnodim who is particularly known for her Social Media for Social Good messages. Bribery and persecution During the course of his duty Ribadu was offered bribes to pervert the course of justice, amongst these was a State governor who offered Ribadu $15 million and a house abroad. Interviewed from Washington D.C. on the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Ribadu said that he took the money and used the bribe as evidence to prosecute the state governor. This claim has however been refuted by the ex-governor who noted that the fact that Ribadu put the money in the CBN is not a proof that he gave the money. Ribadu escaped two assassination attempts in Nigeria before he left the country for the United Kingdom in early 2009. In December 2007, Inspector- General of Police Mike Okiro ordered that Ribadu be temporarily removed from the position of EFCC chairman and ordered him to attend the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru, Jos, Plateau State for a mandatory one-year course. The decision was criticised by, among others, Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, House of Representatives members, and All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) national chairman Edwin Ume-Ezeoke as politically motivated and/or likely to set back the fight against corruption. On 22 December 2008, as widely predicted, he was dismissed from the Nigerian Police force by the Nigerian Police Service Commission (PSC). He left Nigeria and in April assumed a fellowship at the Center for Global Development.\\"Nuhu Ribadu\\" Center for Global Development, accessed 22 February 2010 He returned to join the ACN as a presidential aspirant in the 2011 general elections. International awards On 15 April 2008, Nuhu Ribadu received the World Bank's 2008 Jit Gill Memorial Award for Outstanding Public Service, for having led a courageous anti-corruption drive in Nigeria, as Head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). On 4 August 2008, the Police Service Commission in Nigeria announced the demotion of Mr. Ribadu from Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) to Deputy Commissioner of Police. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo had promoted Ribadu to AIG weeks before the end of his tenure in office in 2007. On 22 November 2008, his graduation from the NIPSS Kuru, Plateau State was aborted at the last minute. Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, who was initially seated in the hall along with other graduands, was ordered out of the hall allegedly on orders from top administration officials. There were condemnations from all over the world for his treatment. On 8 December 2018, he bagged a global lifetime achievement award on anti-corruption campaign. The award was administered by Qatar-based think-tank, Rule of Law and Anti-corruption Centre (ROLACC) .

West eventually moved from North Kingstown to Scituate, Rhode Island, and purchased a farm which Governor Stephen Hopkins had previously owned. West set up a prosperous tavern in 1758 and was an active farmer and molasses trader. Soon after moving to Scituate, West became a deputy (representative) and was also elected as a representative of the town in a general convention held at East Greenwich, September 26, 1786. Between 1760 and 1785, West was elected 12 times as a representative.C.C.Beaman, An Historical Sketch of Scituate, RI, Phenix Capron and Cambell, Steam Book and Job Printers, 1877 Service during the American Revolution At the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Colonel West was placed second in command of the Rhode Island Militia under Esek Hopkins, and West served as a brigadier general from 1775 to 1777. From January to March 1776, West assumed command at Rhode Island (Aquidneck Island) which was then under siege from the British warships in Narragansett Bay. As general, his main task was to root out Tories who were supplying the British. In March, he resigned the command at Newport in disgust after the Rhode Island legislature freed several imprisoned Newport Tory leaders, such as Joseph Wanton, Jr..The American Monthly Magazine By Daughters of the American Revolution, (1895) p. 247 When the British army finally occupied Newport in December 1776, West retreated to Bristol with the militia. During the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778, General West led the Rhode Island militia in the unsuccessful invasion of Aquidneck Island. His troops served as reserves for the regular Continental troops and provided cover during the retreat. West played an active role in the affairs of his town throughout the Revolution. On May 4, 1776, as a Scituate representative, West signed Rhode Island's declaration of independence, which preceded the American Declaration of Independence by two months. He was put in charge of raising troops in the Scituate in 1777 and served on various committees concerning the British blockade, army blankets, salt rationing and firearms. West was made again made brigadier general of the Providence County brigade in 1779. General West was also purported to have invested in privateers during the war. Two cargoes were lost, which supposedly damaged his finances.West, George M., William West of Scituate, R.I.: farmer, soldier, statesman, (St. Andrews, FL: Panama City Publishing, 1919). West was also several times chosen as the moderator of the town, as he was allegedly a man of \\"intelligence, and a marked degree of enterprise.\\" During the war, West was elected Deputy Governor of Rhode Island and served from May 1780 to May 1781. As Deputy Governor, West served on a committee which was integral to the formation of the state of Vermont. Westfield, Vermont, was named after Governor West in 1780 because of his support for Vermont statehood as a legislator. West was also granted land in Vermont for his political services, which he sold in 1785 because of his financial concerns. Judge of Supreme Court and Anti-federalist leader West served as a Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court (then called the Superior Court of Assize, and General Gaol Delivery) from May 1787 to May 1790.Manual - the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1891), p. 208-13. While a judge, West was also a leader in the rural opposition to the adoption of the Constitution, known as the \\"Country Party (Rhode Island)\\". The party supported honoring paper money as legal tender, and the party was in power from 1786 through 1790. West led nearly 1,000 armed, rural citizens to Providence to protest an ox roast celebration and reading the Constitution on July 4, 1788 (shortly after the ninth state had ratified it). Fortunately, a compromise between the federalists and anti-federalists was reached, and civil war was averted (the federalists agreed to celebrate only independence, not the adoption of the Constitution). Resistance to the Constitution, however, remained strong, and Rhode Island was the last of the 13 colonies to ratify the Constitution in 1790. Financial troubles Although West had been a prosperous farmer before the war, the depreciation in value of continental currency ruined him financially. In its first decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in West v. Barnes (1791) that William West could not use continental currency to pay off his mortgage because of a procedural problem with his appeal.heard by U.S. Supreme Court (case: 2 U.S. 401,): Chief Justice John Jay, William Cushing and District Court Judge Henry Marchant.

Description Just like WrestleMania, In Your House is not a wrestling game in the normal sense, as it is heavily influenced by Mortal Kombat. It features digitized sprites of the wrestlers, and many over the top, unrealistic, and magical moves and taunts by the wrestlers.In Your House: Horrific WWF videogame in which the Undertaker hurled ghosts at his hapless opponent. The game also features finishing moves which are performed before the final pin. Instead of typical wrestling arenas, WWF In Your House featured personalised stages for each individual wrestler, such as a nightclub for Shawn Michaels, Stu Hart's Dungeon for Bret Hart and a crypt for The Undertaker. The 10 playable wrestlers in the game include Bret Hart, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels (all returning from WrestleMania), as well as new additions Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, Goldust, Ahmed Johnson, Hunter Hearst Helmsley (who would all return for 1998's WWF WarZone), Vader, and The Ultimate Warrior (who was fired prior to release due to contract disputes). In-game commentary is supplied by Vince McMahon and \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Curt Hennig. Early in development, Jeff Jarrett was planned to be part of the roster and was even filmed for the game. However, when he left the WWF in early 1996 over a contract dispute, his character was scrapped.Behind The Scenes – WWF In Your House Video Game Reception WWF in Your House was a low profile release. At the time Acclaim Entertainment was suffering from financial losses, layoffs, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was pinning most of its hopes on the Nintendo 64 game Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Perhaps as a result, WWF in Your House was largely ignored by critics; GamePro only reviewed the PlayStation version, and high-profile gaming publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN, and even the official Sega Saturn Magazine, did not review it at all. Johnny Ballgame's review in GamePro called it \\"a title full of promise and potential that ultimately gets pinned in its quest for the championship.\\" He particularly criticized that matches are over too quickly, and compared the game unfavorably to Power Move Pro Wrestling, which came out at the same time. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 5.9 out of 10. He said the action is solid but overly derivative of Mortal Kombat, and that the selection of modes offers no true variety. GameSpots Jeff Gerstmann gave the Saturn version a 4.5 out of 10, calling it \\"little more than a rehash of the original\\". Both Ballgame and Gerstmann criticized that the gameplay involves little more than pounding the buttons as rapidly as possible, and the style in general is more akin to a fighting game than a true wrestling game. GameSpots Chris Hudak gave the DOS version a 5.6 out of 10, generally ridiculing the wrestling concept.

Weltenburg Abbey seen from the river Weltenburg Abbey, beer garden Geography The abbey is situated on a peninsula in the Danube, on the so-called \\"Weltenburg Narrows\\" or the \\"Danube Gorge\\". History Already by around 45 AD the area of Weltenburg was the starting point of the Via iuxta DanuviumNach der Inschrift : viam iuxta amnem Danuvium fieri iussit, the Roman military and border road which followed the south bank of the Danube upstream to Brigobannis, the limes fort near Hüfingen. For a long time this road was the most important east-west route north of the Alps. At Mertingen (Sumuntorium) this route intercepted the Via Claudia Augusta from northern Italy. Above the monastery on the Frauenberg there was already a settlement in prehistoric times. Archaeological finds and excavations suggest that a Roman military station was constructed there. First foundation According to tradition, the abbey was founded in 617 in the course of the Hiberno-Scottish mission by Agilus and Eustace of Luxeuil, two monks of Luxeuil Abbey, which had been founded by Saint Columbanus. It is believed to be the oldest monastery in Bavaria. Reportedly during the first half of the 8th century, the abbey adopted the rules of the Benedictine order and was supported by Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria. By 932 at the latest, the abbey was under control of the Bishop of Regensburg. Wolfgang of Regensburg had a residence built on the Frauenberg above today's abbey. The abbey church (replaced in 1716) was consecrated in 1191, a single nave building with a crypt. Under abbot Konrad V (1441-50), the church, abbey buildings were renovated and life in the abbey reformed. It was not until the 18th century, that Weltenburg Abbey rose to prominence under abbot Maurus Bächl (1713-43). To his period date the current monastery courtyard with its Baroque buildings, the highlight of which is the abbey church, dedicated to Saint George, which was built by the Asam Brothers between 1716 and 1739. Following a confiscation of the abbey's silver and a ban on accepting novices, the abbey was officially dissolved on 18 March 1803 during the secularization of Bavaria. The abbey brewery and other manufacturing buildings found buyers, but the church and convent could not be sold. In 1812, they became the parish house, school, teacher house and parish church for Weltenburg village. Second foundation On the initiative of King Ludwig I, Weltenburg was re-founded as a priory of Metten Abbey on 25 August 1842. It renovated the convent and repurchased other properties, including the brewery. It has been a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation since 1858 and was raised to the status of an independent abbey in 1913. The chapel underwent extensive restoration from 1999-2008 at a cost of around 6.5 million euro. In addition, the convent was renovated and the abbey fitted with flood protection. Today Main altar showing St. George Abbey Besides the traditional duties of hospitality, the abbey has pastoral responsibility for two parishes. It is also active in farming and in adult education. It hosts conferences and lectures as well as concerts. The abbey is open to the public, except for the part reserved for the monks. Abbey brewery Weltenburg Abbey brewery (Weltenburger Klosterbrauerei) is by some reckonings the oldest monastic brewery in the world, having been in operation since 1050, although the title is disputed by Weihenstephan Abbey. Weltenburger Kloster Barock Dunkel was given the World Beer Cup award in 2004, 2008 and 2012 as the best Dunkel beer in the world. One wing of the abbey which faces the Danube river houses a large restaurant on the ground floor operated by a tenant. The traditional Bavarian menu includes the abbey's cheese and beer, and guests are also served in the monastery courtyard, which houses a large open-air biergarten during the warmer months.

He played college football at the University of Oklahoma. Early years Rentzel was a four-sport star at Casady School (football, basketball, baseball and track) in Oklahoma City, and also an All-American high school halfback. He was the valedictorian at Oklahoma City’s exclusive Casady School. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Oklahoma under famous coach Bud Wilkinson. As a sophomore, he came off the injured list too late and had to hitchhike to Texas to play in the third game against the #2 ranked Longhorns (he had 2 long receptions). As a junior, he posted 59 carries for 387 yards (second on the team) with a 6.6-yard average and 2 touchdowns. He was a versatile all-around halfback and was known for his open-field speed and propensity for big plays rushing, receiving passes and returning kicks. During his senior year in 1964, he was the team's top pass catcher (268 receiving yards) and punter (40.5-yard average). His 491 rushing yards ranked second on the team. In the Big Eight Conference, his 5.4 rushing average was second only to Gale Sayers. He also was the conference's No. 3 pass receiver, as well as No. 2 punter. He was one of four Sooners players who missed the 1965 Gator Bowl game against Florida State University. Rentzel, offensive lineman Ralph Neely, Jim Grisham, and Wes Skidgel had signed with professional teams before the game and were ruled ineligible for the contest. Florida State won 36–19 on the strength of 4 touchdown catches by Fred Biletnikoff. Professional career=Minnesota Vikings Rentzel was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the second round (23rd overall) of the 1965 NFL draft. He was also selected in the sixth round (48th overall) of the 1965 AFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Rentzel played sparingly as a backup running back due to recurring injuries and his contributions came mainly as a kickoff returner during his first two seasons. Rentzel set the record for the longest kickoff return (101 yards) in franchise history as a rookie, which was broken by Aundrae Allison's 104-yarder in 2007 and Cordarrelle Patterson's 109-yarder in 2013. In 1966, Rentzel only played in nine games due to ankle injuries. He averaged 20.1 yards on nine kickoff returns and caught two passes for 10 yards. On May 2, 1967, Rentzel was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a third-round draft choice (#76-Mike McGill). Dallas Cowboys1967 season= In 1967, the Cowboys converted Rentzel into a flanker, where he became not only an immediate starter over Pete Gent but also one of the best wideouts in the NFL. Rentzel led the team in receptions with 58 for 996 yards (two yards less than Bob Hayes). If Rentzel had gotten 4 more yards and Hayes 2 more, it would have been the first time in NFL history that a team had two 1,000-yard wide receivers. In the tenth game against the Washington Redskins, Rentzel set a franchise record with 13 receptions for 223 yards. He also starred in the 1967 NFL Championship, known since as the \\"Ice Bowl\\", scoring a fourth-quarter, go- ahead touchdown later negated by the Packers' game-clinching drive. =1968 and 1969 seasons= In 1968, Rentzel led the Cowboys in receptions (54) and receiving yards (1,009) with an 18.7-yard average and 5 touchdowns. In 1969, Rentzel led the Cowboys in receptions (43), receiving yards (960), and average receiving yards (22.3). Rentzel tied for the NFL lead in touchdowns scored (13) in 1969. =1970 season= In 1970, he was leading the team in receiving yards, when he was arrested for exposing himself to a 10-year-old girl. At the time the accusation was made, the press revealed a nearly forgotten incident that happened when as a Minnesota Viking in September 1966, he was charged with exposing himself to two young girls in St. Paul, and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of disorderly conduct. He was not sentenced to jail, but merely ordered to seek psychiatric care. Because of the nationwide reaction and publicity from the scandal, his wife, singer and actress Joey Heatherton, divorced him shortly thereafter. Rentzel asked the Cowboys to place him on the inactive list so he could devote his time to settling his personal affairs. He would miss the last three games of the regular season, including the Cowboys' playoff drive to its narrow Super Bowl V loss to the Baltimore Colts. He finished with 28 receptions (second on the team) for 556 yards (second on the team) with a 19.9-yard average and 5 touchdowns. =1971 season= On May 19, 1971, Rentzel was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for tight end Billy Truax and wide receiver Wendell Tucker. Head coach Tom Landry said after the trade, \\"We know we are giving up on one of the top flankers in the league, but I thought he would be better off in another city where he had the same opportunity regularly. We found this in Los Angeles, and it was one of the teams Lance wanted to be traded to if he were traded.\\" To replace him, the Cowboys also obtained Lance Alworth from the San Diego Chargers, in exchange for the left tackle Tony Liscio, the tight end Pettis Norman, and the defensive tackle Ron East. Although he spent only four seasons with the Cowboys, Rentzel left as the team's fourth all-time wide receiver in addition to other franchise records: * Most receptions in a game (13 in 1967), which was broken by Jason Witten twice (15 in 2007 and 18 in 2012). * Most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (three), until Michael Irvin passed him in 1995 with four. * Still fourth for most receiving touchdowns in a season (12). * Still fourth for most career postseason receiving yards (242). * Still fourth for most receiving yards in a game (233). Los Angeles Rams Rentzel led the Los Angeles Rams in receptions (38) in 1971, but was never able to regain his previous level of play. In October 1972, he was the subject of a lengthy feature article in SPORT Magazine written by Gary Cartwright. Also that year, Rentzel wrote When All the Laughter Died in Sorrow, about his professional football experiences and personal life. In 1973, while on probation for the indecent exposure charge, Rentzel was suspended indefinitely by the NFL at the start of the 1973 season for conduct detrimental to the league after being convicted for possession of marijuana. He was reinstated in 1974 after a ten-month suspension. Rentzel was one of three men credited with inspiring the eccentricities that surround Media Day at the Super Bowl. In January 1975, SPORT Magazine editor Dick Schaap hired Rentzel and teammate Fred Dryer to cover Super Bowl IX. Donning costumes inspired by The Front Page, \\"Cubby O'Switzer\\" (Rentzel) and \\"Scoops Brannigan\\" (Dryer) peppered players and coaches from both the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers with questions that ranged from the clichéd to the downright absurd. Rentzel humorously explained, \\"We're here to ask the dumbest questions we can and to mooch as much food and beer as we possibly can.\\"Penner, Mike. \\"Dick Schaap, 67; Sports Journalist\\" (obituary), Los Angeles Times, Saturday, December 22, 2001.\\"Rentzel, Dryer Find A Way To Super Bowl,\\" The Associated Press, Friday, January 10, 1975. Retirement On August 27, 1975, Rentzel was placed on waivers, effectively ending his career. After playing in nine NFL seasons, Rentzel accumulated 4,826 receiving yards, 38 receiving touchdowns, 196 rushing yards, three rushing touchdowns, 1,000 return yards, a touchdown from a fumble recovery, and a perfect passer rating of 158.3 by completing his lone pass attempt for a 58-yard touchdown. Personal life In April 1969, Rentzel married Joey Heatherton, an actress, dancer, and singer, in New York City. In November 1970, Rentzel was arrested for exposing himself to a 10-year-old girl. He pled guilty to the charge and promised to undergo psychiatric treatment and was given a suspended sentence. Afterwards, fans started calling Rentzel \\"No-Pants Lance\\" and making jokes like, \\"Don’t worry, even if we are down late, I’m sure Lance will pull it out sooner or later.\\" Heatherton filed for divorce on September 18, 1971 and it became final in 1972. Rentzel later wrote a book, When All the Laughter Died in Sorrow, reflecting upon those events.

Jackson has also served as assistant engineer, executive officer and surveyor of public lands in colonial Singapore and laid out the city plan (the Jackson Plan) for Singapore in 1822. He was a key person in Raffles plans for the settlement and the Elgin Bridge in Singapore was once named in his honour. Early life At the age of 16, Jackson became a cadet in the East India Company’s army, and went to India to join the famous Bengal Artillery Regiment. He was subsequently posted to Singapore to defend the town in case of an attack and arrived on the island on 22 January 1822. The attack, however, never materialised. Career=Assistant Engineer and Surveyor of Public Lands Plan of Singapore drawn up by Jackson under instruction from Raffles When Stamford Raffles was on his third and final visit to Singapore in October 1822, he sought able men to help him build the town of Singapore as he was dissatisfied with the way William Farquhar, the first British resident and commandant of Singapore, had developed the settlement. Raffles appointed Jackson as assistant engineer on 29 October 1822 to remodel and rebuild Singapore according to his own plan and formed a Town Committee on 4 November 1822 with Jackson assigned to assist it. Jackson spent five years in Singapore as assistant engineer, executive officer and surveyor of public lands, helping in the redevelopment of the fledgling town. Jackson oversaw the construction of the first bridge that spanned the banks of the Singapore River in 1822, at the site where the Elgin bridge now stands. The wooden footbridge, called Presentment Bridge, was also known as Monkey Bridge. It served as the only means of crossing the river until 1840, when Coleman Bridge was built further upstream. On 6 December 1822, the Town Committee reported that a draft outline of the streets was ready, and by February 1823, the plan had taken definite shape, with proposals for Singapore’s future progress. With this, named Jackson Plan or Raffles Town Plan, the construction programme went into full swing. Although the plan was not an actual survey but an outline of the town, it nonetheless followed Raffles’s instructions concerning government, military and commercial locations. The plan also clearly demarcated the locations of residential clusters to house the island’s different ethnic communities. A sketch of Singapore by Philip Jackson in June 1823. It is the oldest surviving drawing of a view of Singapore. In a sketch drawing of Singapore dated 5 June 1823, the town was depicted to the east of the Singapore River with Fort Canning Hill in the background, as viewed from the sea. Jackson was known to have drawn other maps and plans for Raffles. On 1 February 1826, Jackson was appointed surveyor of public lands and his responsibilities included surveying lands and registering grants and transfers. Singapore Institution As per Raffles’s instructions on 12 January 1823, Jackson prepared plans for the construction of the Singapore Institution (later renamed Raffles Institution) building. This was in accordance with Raffles’s wish to bring in the best Western education for the benefit of Southeast Asian students in Singapore. With Jackson as the architect and engineer, work commenced that year based on a rudimentary design centred on a rusticated base, with carriage porches and colonnaded piers. Tall and rectangular louvered windows were separated by simple Doric pilasters that lined the first storey. It was originally built in the shape of a cross, with wings to be added to each arm. However, construction was shoddy and by 1832, the building was unfinished. It remained in an unfinished state for several years until George Coleman, government superintendent of public works, was appointed in 1835 as the new architect and completion of the building in May 1839 according to Jackson’s original plan.

C.\\" Green (Born 1964) is an English musician, best known as the co-founder and bass guitarist of the Birmingham-based industrial metal band, Godflesh. Biography A native of Birmingham, Green was involved in the city's post-punk and goth scenes in early 1980s and was close friends with musicians such as Paul Neville and Diarmuid Dalton. He formed his first band, OPD (Officially Pronounced Dead), in 1982 with Neville. The band usually rehearsed at Green's house or Nevilles house. They changed their name to Fall of Because after the Killing Joke song of the same name in 1985. Initially they used a basic drum machine, with Neville playing guitar, and Green on bass and vocals, and were writing songs influenced by The Cures' 17 Seconds and Faith albums. After meeting a 15-year-old Justin Broadrick in 1984 outside their local council estate shops, above which Broadrick lived with his parents, they started their friendship over their mutual admiration for the Stranglers, and other punk bands. Soon, Broadrick started playing drums in the band, and the three of them began writing songs that were influenced by bands such as Swans and Sonic Youth, whilst still retaining the psychedelic overtones that was inherent in the earlier Fall of Because music. Green was also introduced to various artists such as Throbbing Gristle, Whitehouse and SPK at this time, by Broadrick. In 1986 they recorded a demo, Extirpate, at Rich Bitch studios in Birmingham, and sold a few copies to friends and other musicians in Birmingham. The band also played several gigs at The Mermaid public house in Birmingham with the likes of Napalm Death, Heresy, Amebix. In 1987 Broadrick left Fall of Because to join Head of David. When Broadrick was sacked from Head of David in 1988, he and Green, who were sharing a flat together at the time, formed Godflesh. Throughout its career, Godflesh has released eight records and pioneered the industrial metal genre. After recording Godflesh's sixth album, Hymns, in October 2001, he left Godflesh. He was replaced by Prong bassist Paul Raven. Nevertheless, the band disbanded in 2002 in the midst of their European tour. In following years, Green, who supported himself with various professions, disappeared from the music scene until 2010. Green's only solo album, I-VII, was released under his Vitriol moniker in 1998 through Neurot Recordings. It was recorded in 1995. Green was married in 2010. Green and Broadrick also reunited Godflesh in 2010 and began touring. The band's seventh album, and the first since the reunion, A World Lit Only by Fire, was released in 2014. Their eighth album, Post Self, followed in 2017. Green is scheduled to make his solo debut as Vitriol on 8 December, 2018 at Hospital Fest 2018 in Queens, New York, twenty years after the Vitriol album was first released. Artistry=Tone, playing style and influences Roadburn 2018 Rob Haynes of The Quietus described Green's bass sound as \\"like the noise a glacier might make as it remorselessly ground a mountain to dust.\\" Green's basslines were essential in Godflesh's music and \\"freed up Broadrick to conjur the atmosphere with his droning guitar sound.\\" Green also adapted his style to Godflesh's various influences, including electronic music, dub, breakbeat and hip hop. Green describes his sound as \\"heavy, downtuned and driving\\" and tunes his bass to B standard. He occasionally plays chords to \\"give extra weight and depth\\" and sometimes uses slapping to \\"add a percussive tone and physicality.\\" His favourite bass guitarists include Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Jean-Jacques Burnel of the Stranglers, Paul McCartney of the Beatles and Dennis Dunaway, the original bassist for Alice Cooper Band.

Bosch debuted as the lead character in the 1992 novel The Black Echo, the first in a best-selling police procedural series now numbering 21 novels. The novels are more or less coincident in timeframe with the year in which they were published. Harry, as he is commonly known by his associates, is a veteran police homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. He was named after the 15th-century Dutch artist Hieronymus Bosch. Since 2015, Titus Welliver has portrayed the title character in Bosch, a television series adapted from the novels. Biography of the character=Background Bosch's mother was a prostitute in Hollywood who was murdered on October 28, 1961, when Bosch was 11 years old. His father, whom he met later in life, was Mickey Haller, Sr., a prominent defense attorney known for representing mobster Mickey Cohen, among other clients. Bosch spent his youth in various orphanages and youth halls, and with the occasional foster family. When he learned of his mother's murder, Bosch, then living at a youth hall, dived to the bottom of the pool, screamed until he ran out of air, and then swam back to the surface. This event is referenced in several Bosch novels. He joined the United States Army at age 17, after getting his foster father to sign the enlistment papers. In Vietnam, Bosch was a \\"tunnel rat\\" (nicknamed \\"Hari Kari Bosch\\"), with the 1st Infantry Division—a specialized soldier whose job it was to go into the maze of tunnels used as barracks, hospitals, and on some occasions, morgues, by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army. While in the enemy tunnels, the Tunnel Rats would kill enemy soldiers they encountered, gather documents for analysis by military intelligence, and then plant C-4 high explosive charges that they would set to detonate after they exited the tunnels. Once, while on R&R; leave in Hawaii, Bosch went AWOL, but returned to his unit and served two tours of duty in Vietnam. Bosch has a daughter named Madeline (\\"Maddie\\") with his ex-wife Eleanor Wish. Maddie spent most of her time with her mother in Hong Kong, where Eleanor was a professional gambler and star attraction at a Macau casino. Bosch saw his daughter in person only twice a year. Eleanor had a personal security guard, Sun Yee, who was also her boyfriend. She was killed during an attempt to rescue Maddie from Chinese thugs, detailed in 9 Dragons. Subsequently, Maddie lived with her father in Los Angeles. LAPD career After his return from Vietnam and an honorable discharge from the Army, Bosch joined the LAPD and rose to the rank of Detective III, a position which entails both investigative and supervisory duties, and is the LAPD equivalent of Detective Sergeant. While in the LAPD, Bosch worked in the prestigious Robbery Homicide Division (RHD) for five years but was drummed out by an Internal Affairs Division (IAD) investigation involving Bosch's shooting of a suspect (The Dollmaker) who was later linked to nine murders. Following the IAD investigation, which was conducted by Detectives Pierce Lewis and Don Clarke, Bosch was sent to Hollywood Division and assigned to the Homicide desk. (Lewis and Clarke also investigated Bosch in The Black Echo). At one point, Bosch left the LAPD and worked as a private investigator for three years. He left retirement and returned to the LAPD at the conclusion of The Narrows. After his return, Bosch was assigned to RHD's Open-Unsolved Unit, a cold case squad. Bosch transferred out of Open-Unsolved and into Homicide Special during the time between Echo Park and The Overlook. During his time in the LAPD as covered in the novels, Bosch was in Hollywood Homicide and worked with Frankie Sheehan (Bosch's partner in RHD, who was later murdered in Angels Flight), Jerry Edgar (his longest-serving partner), and Kizmin \\"Kiz\\" Rider, the other members of Bosch's team in Hollywood Homicide. The 2004 Limited Edition DVD that was available with The Narrows included an excerpt of a speech real-life LAPD Chief William Bratton made at the Police Academy, in which he publicly asked Harry Bosch to return from retirement (Connelly was on the stand behind him listening to the speech; see Blue Neon Night: Michael Connelly's Los Angeles). In The Overlook, Connelly gave Bratton an approving endorsement (albeit without using his name) for \\"raising the morale of the rank and file\\" and for giving \\"Bosch his job back\\" (pp. 145–146 of the Vision paperback edition). In The Closers, Bosch was once again partnered with Rider, while Edgar remained in Hollywood Homicide. Bosch remained partnered with Rider until her transfer to the Chief's office after being shot during Echo Park. During The Overlook, Bosch partnered with Detective Ignacio \\"Iggy\\" Ferras, a younger detective with whom Bosch had not yet developed a solid rapport. In The Drop and The Black Box he is partnered with Detective David Chu. Not a stranger to being second-guessed, Bosch was investigated by the LAPD's IAD multiple times and was always cleared. In The Burning Room he is partnered with a young detective named Lucia Soto. Bosch is suspended by their unit's commander for a minor violation of departmental procedure after Soto and he cleared a tough homicide case. Bosch is forced to take retirement even though the disciplinary case against him is eventually dropped. Post LAPD career In The Crossing Bosch works as a criminal defense investigator for his half-brother Mickey Haller. Bosch’s work helps Haller clear an innocent man who was wrongfully prosecuted for a crime that he did not commit. Although glad to help clear the man's name, Bosch did not enjoy working for the defense during the trial and decides to try something else. He continues to work as a private investigator in The Wrong Side of Goodbye. He investigates the matter of locating the heir to the estate of a dying billionaire. He also accepts a position as a reserve officer working for the city of San Fernando, California Police Department. The chief of the San Fernando P.D. hires Bosch to work as a detective to utilize Bosch's years of experience with the LAPD. Bosch is partnered with Detective Bella Lourdes, and the pair solves a case involving a series of violent rapes. In Two Kinds of Truth Bosch continues to work as a Detective for the SFPD. He helps clear a double homicide case involving the trafficking of illegal prescription painkilling pharmaceuticals. He also clears his name of wrongdoing in an old LAPD homicide case of his. Dark Sacred Night sees Bosch pushed to his personal and professional limits. During the events of Two Kinds of Truth, he meets an oxycodone addict named Elizabeth Clayton. He takes her into his home to help rehabilitate her, promising to investigate the unsolved murder of her daughter Daisy. He fulfils this promise in Dark Sacred Night, but Elizabeth relapses and ultimately overdoses--which is implied to be suicide--and Bosch struggles with the knowledge that Elizabeth's sobriety meant that she was constantly reminded of her daughter's death. Meanwhile, Bosch investigates the cold case murder of a gangster in San Fernando which spirals out of control when a confidential informant is murdered. When the informant's killer is identified, Bosch realises the SFPD detective Oscar Luzon has undisclosed connections to the killer. Bosch engineers an interrogation, but Luzon attempts suicide and winds up comatose. Bosch accepts responsibility to protect Bella Lourdes, knowing that it will cost him a job. These pressures come to a head when Bosch confronts Daisy Clayton's killer, coerces a confession out of him, and tips off the grieving, Mafia-connected father of another victim about the killer's location. Bosch ultimately relents and alerts LAPD, but once again faces an uncertain future. In The Night Fire, Bosch is once again pushed to his limits. He is informed that he has contracted chronic myeloid leukemia from his exposure to radiation in The Overlook, and has also been working as the investigator for his half brother once again (due to Cisco having to undergo an appendectomy). After Haller gets the man off for murdering a judge, the LAPD detective assigned to the case tells Bosch he has \\"undone everything he did with the badge\\". This causes Bosch to investigate other leads in the case to find the true killer, which leads him to a law firm also tied to a case Ballard is currently investigating. Bosch ultimately lets the killer go to save Ballard. Meanwhile, after the death of his former partner, who was his mentor when he first became a detective, Bosch is given a murder book by his partner's widow, which he took home after retirement. The murder book details the murder of an drug addicted ex-convict. Upon the widow's request, Bosch investigates the murder with Ballard's help, despite quickly realizing his former partner may not have investigated the case at all. In the end, they solve the case and arrest the killer, but Bosch becomes disillusioned after discovering that his partner took the case not to solve it, but to prevent anyone else from doing so, as he was the father of the victim. In the end, Bosch decides to investigate another murder which his partner had taken records on, and Ballard agrees to help him. Personal characteristics Bosch lived in a house on stilts at 7203 Woodrow Wilson Drive in the Hollywood Hills. The money that financed Bosch's upscale home came from his work as a technical advisor for a TV mini-series, in which actor Dan Lacey portrays Bosch in a serial killer case the detective had worked. Bosch's house was later damaged during the Northridge earthquake, shortly before the book The Last Coyote. After his house was condemned and demolished, Bosch had a new one built on the same road, still facing out over the valley. Bosch has an active love life, with usually one love interest per book. He has a daughter, Madelaine (\\"Maddie\\"), who, as of 9 Dragons, is living with him. She had formerly lived with her mother, Harry's ex-wife Eleanor Wish (a former FBI agent, ex-con, and professional poker player, whom Bosch met in The Black Echo and married while on a case in Las Vegas). Wish left Bosch in Angels Flight and was killed in Hong Kong. Recent stories find Bosch linked in a close relationship with FBI agent Rachel Walling. The liaison formulated in The Narrows and heightened romantically during Echo Park, but Walling broke off the relationship at its conclusion. Walling returned in The Overlook on a strictly professional basis, and she has since resumed a relationship with reporter Jack McEvoy. Walling notes in The Scarecrow that her relationship with Bosch broke up in part because Bosch was still in love with Eleanor Wish. Bosch is left-handed. He stands a few inches short of six feet and is described as wiry. His muscles are like nylon cords, strength concealed by economy of scale. He has a moustache and brown hair that is by now graying (The Black Echo). Bosch's eyes are a key aspect of his appearance; they are brown and nearly black, and were mentioned often for this reason in A Darkness More Than Night. Connelly gives a good clue as to how he visualizes Bosch when, in The Overlook, Rachel Walling tells Bosch: \\"You look like House\\" (actor Hugh Laurie). Bosch is always finding himself in conflict with authority, whether with his lieutenant, or a deputy chief of police (specifically Irvin Irving, Bosch's recurring nemesis until Irving was forced to retire at the end of The Closers and is now a city councilman), or the FBI. His confrontational side is usually attributed to his strong sense of right and wrong, coupled with little regard for his career. At the end of The Overlook, Connelly states this trait can be described in a single word: \\"relentless\\". He also uses this word in Lost Light, describing jazz, and implying a self-reference to his own work and personality. Bosch has a half- brother, Mickey Haller, a Los Angeles attorney who makes his first appearance in the novel The Lincoln Lawyer, although he briefly appears in a flashback in The Black Ice as a boy. Haller is the legitimate son of the attorney who fathered Bosch. In the second Mickey Haller novel, The Brass Verdict, it is revealed that Harry Bosch has known for years of the relationship, but Haller was unaware of it until the end of the book. Bosch's namesake, the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, was famous for his religious portrayal of Earthly sins (mostly debauchery) and their violent consequences. In several of the books there are parallels suggested between the Hell in the paintings and the events of the fictional Bosch's life. \\"Hieronymus\\" is the Latin form of the male name Jerome, but Connelly has written he used the nickname \\"Harry\\" for the character rather than \\"Jerry\\" as a tribute to \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan, the police officer played in a series of films by Clint Eastwood. Besides the Connelly series, Harry Bosch has made cameos in books by Paula Woods, Joe Gores, and Robert Crais.The Wall Street Journal Online - Leisure & Arts Likewise, during an October 16, 2008 book-signing in San Mateo, California, to promote The Brass Verdict, Michael Connelly informed the audience that Bosch also appeared in a cameo, without identification, in Connelly's novel Chasing the Dime. With two exceptions the Bosch novels are narrated in the third- person, initially focused entirely on Bosch's point of view. Later novels include occasional scenes from the perspective of other characters, but the overall emphasis is on Bosch. Lost Light (2003), the first novel in the series in which Bosch works as a private investigator, is narrated in the first- person by Bosch, a nod to private detective novels which are traditionally narrated by the investigator. The Narrows (2004), set during Bosch's temporary LAPD retirement, is also narrated by Bosch, but The Closers (2005) returns to third-person narration. Bosch is a jazz enthusiast and frequently plays vinyl records through vintage audio equipment. In several episodes in the series, a McIntosh MX110 tuner/pre-amplifier, McIntosh MC240 power amplifier, Marantz 6300 turntable, and Ohm Walsh 3 speakers can be seen. Personal firearms Bosch carries a revolver in The Black Echo (he has to remove spent cartridges to reload during the S&L; shootout). In later books, Bosch uses a \\"Smith & Wesson\\" or an \\"auto pistol\\", probably a Smith & Wesson Model 5906 9mm which was a popular approved-carry weapon in the LAPD at the time; the weapon was approved for carry as an alternative to the standard-issue Beretta 92FS around 1992-93. In The Black Ice he uses a Smith and Wesson .44 as a decoy gun when entering Mexico so that border guards would seize that and not his service weapon, hidden in his tire well. The gun had been a gift from the father of a victim in a previous case, and Bosch never used it because its grips were for right-handed use, while he is left-handed. In Lost Light, after Bosch retired from Homicide and got his PI license, he kept a Glock 27 .40SW caliber, semi- automatic, subcompact pistol in his closet for personal protection (mistakenly described in the book as a \\"Glock P7\\"). After the North Hollywood shootout, the LAPD authorized officers to carry .45 ACP pistols in lieu of the 9mm. In The Overlook Bosch has transferred to the RHD Special Section and carries a Kimber Ultra Carry II .45 ACP caliber semiautomatic pistol. In The Burning Room, Bosch is carrying a Glock 30, .45 ACP caliber, semi-automatic pistol and using the Kimber as his backup gun. In Dark Sacred Night, Bosch carries a Smith & Wesson Model 15 Combat Masterpiece .38 Special. It is referred to as the revolver he carried as a patrol officer in the past. The S&W; Combat Masterpiece was standard issue to LAPD officers from the mid-1970s to 1986, when the Beretta was adopted. Novel series { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" The Harry Bosch Novels ! !

The series follows Bosch \\"as he pursues the killer of a 12-year-old boy while standing trial in federal court on accusations that he murdered a suspected serial killer in cold blood.\\"\\"Prime Instant Video Greenlights First-Ever Drama Pilots\\" According to Connelly, a number of changes were made \\"to the world of Harry Bosch ... in making the shift from page to screen\\".

Also in the television series, Harry \\"is 47 years old and a veteran of the first Gulf War in 1991, where he was part of a Special Forces team that cleared tunnels.

A National Historic Landmark, it is notable architecturally as the earliest known work of the designer and architect Ithiel Town, and historically as the residence of several Harvard College luminaries. Its most notable occupant was Asa Gray (1810–88), a leading botanist who published the first complete work on American flora, and was a vigorous defender of the Darwinian theory of evolution. History The Gray House was designed in 1810 by architect Ithiel Town, whose earliest known work it is. It was built for the zoologist William Dandridge Peck, and originally stood at the corner of Garden and Linnaean Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the grounds of the Harvard College Botanical Garden. Subsequent occupants included botanist Thomas Nuttall and Harvard presidents James Walker and Jared Sparks. Asa Gray purchased the house in 1842 and moved in during the summer of 1844, after receiving an appointment to a professorship at Harvard that he would hold for 45 years. Already a rising star in the world of botany, Gray in 1848 published The General of the Plants of the United States, which was not only groundbreaking for the content, but also in its presentation. His discovery of relationships between plants of North America and East Asia was influential in the growth of the field of plant geography. His highly public defense of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species gained him widespread attention in the public sphere. The Gray House was purchased in 1910 by Allen Cox, who moved it to its present address the same year. It is a private residence, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and Architecture The house has a rectangular main block, measuring , with a side ell that is about square. When first built, it was attached to a plant conservatory that was also designed by Town. The house is two stories tall and five bays wide, with a hip roof surrounded by a low balustrade. The main facade is flushboarded, with pilasters at the corners; the other sides of the house are sheathed in clapboards. The cornice on the main block is dentillated; that on the ell is plain. The main entrance is centered on the front facade, with sidelight windows on either side and a fanlight window above. The entry is sheltered by a portico supported by clustered square columns; this portico is a replacement to the original, made when the house was moved. There is a secondary entrance in the ell, which is sheltered by a closed-in porch dating to c. 1920. At the rear of the house is an addition, roughly dating to the move but extended later, which incorporates a formerly-external shed into the house. The interior of the house follows a typical Federal-period center hall plan, with the central hall divided into front and rear sections (each with a staircase) by a doorway with a fanlight. There are two rooms on either side of the central hall. The woodwork in the public spaces is not particularly elaborate, with simple cornice moldings and fireplace surrounds, and flared moldings around the windows. The downstairs room of the ell served as Asa Gray's study, and includes a number of wood- frame display cases lining one wall.

Blaine House, is the official residence of the Governor of Maine and his or her family. The Executive Mansion was officially declared the residence of the Governor in 1919 with the name \\"Blaine House\\". It is located at Capitol and State streets in Augusta, across the street from the Maine State House. The Blaine House was donated to the State of Maine for use as a Governor's residence by Harriet Blaine Beale in 1919. It is commonly misconstrued to be the house of Blaine A. Marks. The house dates back to 1833 and was built by James Hall, a retired ship's captain. James G. Blaine, then the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, purchased it in 1862 as a present for his wife, the former Harriet Stanwood, daughter of a prominent Augusta family. Blaine substantially enlarged the building, constructing an addition at the rear that was a near replica of the original structure, and removing interior walls to create a large entertainment space. During World War I the house was used by Maine's Committee for Public Safety. It was presented to the State by Blaine's youngest daughter, Mrs. Harriet Blaine Beale, and established by the 1919 Legislature as the official residence of the Governor of Maine. It was remodeled, to designs by the noted Maine architect John Calvin Stevens, prior to the first governor taking residence in 1921. Carl E. Miliken was the first governor to occupy the residence.History of the Blaine House The Blaine House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, for its association with Blaine, an influential political and diplomatic figure on the national stage in the decades following the Civil War.Polly M. Rettig and S. Sydney Bradford (19 Aug 1963) , National Park Service and In June 2014, a system of high efficiency heat pumps was installed in the Blaine House in an effort to reduce the heating bill, after a test of one over the winter in the Governor's sleeping quarters. With heating oil, the Blaine House used 5,074 gallons of oil at a cost of $16,775 in 2013. The oil boiler is also going to be converted to natural gas in a further effort to reduce costs, though that system will only be needed on the coldest days. The total cost of the upgrades is expected to be $115,000. The current residents are Governor Janet Mills and her family.

It is situated between the second and third miles of the Via Appia between the basilica and catacombs of San Sebastiano and the imposing late republican tomb of Caecilia Metella, which dominates the hill that rises immediately to the east of the complex. It is part of the Parco Regionale Appia Antica (Appian Way Regional Park). The Circus itself is the best preserved in the area of Rome, and is second only in size to the Circus Maximus in Rome.For general size comparisons, see Humphrey, J H (1986) Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing London: Batsford, pp. 56-131. The only games recorded at the circus were its inaugural ones and these are generally thought to have been funerary in character.For example, see Bertolotti, R. De Angelis (2001), \\"I Giochi Circensi\\", in R. De Angelis Bertolotti et al. (eds), La Residenza Imperiale di Massenzio. Rome: Fratelli Palombi, 60-64. They would have been held in honour of Maxentius' son Valerius Romulus, who died in AD 309 at a very young age and who was probably interred in the adjacent cylindrical tomb (tomb of Romulus). The imperial box (pulvinar) of the circus is connected, via a covered portico, to the villa of Maxentius, whose scant remains are today obscured by dense foliage, except for the apse of the basilical audience hall, which pokes out from the tree tops. The complex was probably never used after the death of Maxentius in AD 312 (archaeological excavations indicate the tracks were covered in sand already in antiquity). The circus is constructed, after the fashion of many Roman buildings of this period, in concrete faced with opus vittatum.See Adam, J.-P. and M. Fulford (1994). Roman Building Materials and Techniques. London: Batsford. The putlog holes which held the scaffolding are evident in many places in the walls, which stand several metres high in places. The modern-day visitor enters the circus from the west end, where the remains of the two still imposing towers are located. These would have contained the mechanism for raising the carceres (starting gates), which were positioned on an arcuated course between the towers. Once out of the gates, the chariots would race down the track, the full length of which can still be seen. The track was excavated in the 19th century by Antonio Nibby, whose discovery of an inscription to the 'divine Romulus' led to the circus being positively identified with Maxentius.CIL VI.1138; Nibby, A. (1825). Del Circo volgarmente detto di Caracalla. Rome: Tipografia delle Belle Arte. The spina, the barrier running down the middle of the track, is exactly 1000 Roman feet (296 m) long, and would have been cased in marble. Its many ornaments, including cones, metae and obelisks, would have cast strange, Piranesi-esque shadows across the track in the late afternoon sun. In the centre stood the Obelisk of Domitian which Maxentius presumably had moved from the Isaeum as part of the tribute to his son. Covered in hieroglyphs and lying broken in five pieces it was much discussed during the Renaissance and engraved by Etienne du Perac among others. The Collector Earl of Arundel paid a deposit for the pieces in the 1630s and attempted to have them removed to London but Urban VIII forbad its export and his successor Innocent X had it erected in the Piazza Navona by Bernini.Edward Chaney, \\"Roma Britannica and the Cultural Memory of Egypt: Lord Arundel and the Obelisk of Domitian\\", in Roma Britannica: Art Patronage and Cultural Exchange in Eighteenth-Century Rome, eds. D. Marshall, K. Wolfe and S. Russell, British School at Rome, 2011, pp. 147–70. The track's outer walls were laid out to be wider at the start to allow the racers to spread out before reaching the spina, and were also made wider at the point of the turn, which accommodated the turning circle of the chariots. At the east end of the track is a small triumphal arch, in which exposed opus vittatum work can be seen. The judges' box was located about two-thirds of the way down on the southern side of the track, where it would have been in clear sight of the finishing line. The imperial box, the remains of which are identifiable, was situated in the usual fashion to give the most dramatic views of the race. Directly opposite the imperial box, in the south track wall, there is a small arch, through which can be seen the Tomb of Caecilia Metella. From the height of the box the tomb would have been entirely visible, and it has been argued that the circus, which is curiously positioned relative to contemporary and existing structures, was purposely skewed in order to integrate the tomb into the Maxentian architectural scheme.Kerr, Loraine (2001). \\"A topography of death: the buildings of the emperor Maxentius on the Via Appia, Rome\\". Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference, pp. 24-33. Oxford: Oxbow. The circus-complex of Maxentius as originally conceived can be partly understood as an elaborate imperial version of the type of elite residences that appear in Rome and throughout the provinces in late antiquity, whose pretensions are evidenced in the regular presence of large audience halls, familial tombs and circus-shaped structures - the Villa Gordiani, also in Rome, and the complex at Piazza Armerina in Sicily, are two examples.Steinby, M. (ed.) (1995). Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae, vol II, pp.34-25.Wilson, R. (1983). Piazza Armerina London: Granada. The progenitor of these residences was of course the Palatine complex in Rome, where Maxentius himself made some alterations to the palace in which he played out public life.Carettoni, G. (1972). \\"Terme di Settimio Severo e terme di Massenzio in Palatio\\". Archeologia Classica 24: 96ff. The most instructive imperial parallel for the Via Appia complex is that of Maxentius's contemporary Galerius at Thessaloniki, though Diocletian's Palace at Split furnishes some useful comparisons.For references to Galerius' palace, which is scantily written about, see Vickers, M. (1973) Observations on the octagon at Thessaloniki Journal of Roman Studies 63, pp.111-20. The best shorter account of the history of Diocletian's Palace is: Wilkes, J J (1993) Diocletian's Palace, Split: Residence of a Retired Roman Emperor Sheffield: University Press. The complex may well have changed in use and character following the death of Romulus; the mausoleum, surely intended for Maxentius himself, as were the mausolea built by Galerius and Diocletian intended for themselves whilst still alive, now received as its occupant Maxentius' only son. The inaugural games became funeral games, and these, like the circus, were dedicated to the now deified Romulus. The pervasive emphasis of death and apotheosis has led to the argument that the whole complex became overwhelmingly funerary in character from this point, and that the memorial references generated by Romulus extend, spatially and ideologically, to the heart of Rome. Maxentius died just three years after Romulus, at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, when he was defeated by Constantine the Great, who then expropriated the property. The circus is under the care of the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma, and is open to the public. It is accessible via a bus which runs regularly from the Metropolitana stop called Colli Albani, or by the 118 bus from Piazza Venezia. The most up-to-date guides, in English and Italian, are provided by Coarelli, but Claridge's account is also clear and succinct, as well as being relatively recent. For in-depth research and references, volume one of Steinby's Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae is the starting point.Coarelli, F. (2008). Rome and Environs.

Its length is and its weight is from . It has a wingspan.Spotted eagle-owl (Bubo africanus). The facial disk is off white to pale ochre and the eyes are yellow. It has prominent ear tufts, and the upper body is dusky brown, the lower parts off-white with brown bars. Prior to 1999 the spotted eagle-owl was considered conspecific with the greyish eagle-owl, but now it is classed as a separate species. Food and habits Its prey mainly consists of rodents, small mammals, birds, insects and reptiles. It often swallows its prey whole, with much head-jerking, pausing and resting in between, while a portion of the prey remains inside the mouth, until the prey can finally be swallowed down completely. Undigested substances such as feathers and bone are regurgitated within the next 24 hours of ingestion in the form of a pellet. For prey too large to swallow whole, the owl will tear pieces of meat from the prey, and will also tear shreds to feed nestlings. The male will hunt and bring food when the female cannot leave the nest. Sometimes, even in conditions verging on starvation, he will tear the head off a mouse, but bring the body for the female to feed to the young, or to eat herself if the eggs have not yet hatched. The species is a non-specialised feeder, in contrast to say, the barn owls (Tyto) and is accordingly itinerant, remaining in a given region to hunt for a few weeks or months, then moving on when the local prey is no longer plentiful or easy to catch. Typically it will return at odd intervals of a year or two, depending on local conditions. An adult pair is typically very aggressive in defence of its hunting territory, and one obstacle for an adolescent to overcome is to find good feeding grounds where there are no incumbent adults to eject or kill it. A spotted eagle-owl feeding on a rat A spotted eagle-owl is feeding young owlets inside an owl house made from recycled plastic. Photographed at the Owl Rescue Centre in the North West Province of South Africa The calls are generally typical, musical eagle-owl hoots. Generally the male call with two hoots: \\"Hooo hooopoooo\\" and the female answers with three, with less stress on the middle note: \\"Hooo hoo hooo\\". The young do not hoot till effectively adult, but from a very young age they will hiss threateningly and snap their beaks castanet-like if alarmed. These sounds they make throughout life, generally in a threatening attitude with head down and wings spread sideways to present their upper surfaces forward, umbrella-like. They might present such behaviour either as a challenge to rival owls or when defending nest or young against enemies. The young at least have a whickering call of protest or annoyance when handled. In a comfortable social situation the youngsters have a soft croaking \\"kreeep\\" that they are prone to repeat at regular intervals of a few seconds. If they suspect that they have lost their company, the calls increase in frequency and they are likely to go hunting for their companions. As with all owls this species, when detected, is subject to daylight harassment by local birds. In the Gauteng area its main and extremely loud tormentor is the grey loerie, respite only coming at dusk. Spotted eagle-owls are regular bathers and during summer thunderstorms may be seen on tree limbs or on the ground with spread wings. Conservation Spotted eagle-owls are the most common species of owl found in Southern Africa. They have a healthy population in most parts of the country. They are often referred to as urban owls and will live in close proximity to human habitation. It is illegal to capture or keep any indigenous owls in South Africa without the necessary rehabilitation permit issued by the Department of Nature Conservation. Specialized care is required in captivity consisting of a balanced diet with the correct ratio of calcium to phosphorus and specific husbandry needs that should be met. If raised on the incorrect diet, owlets suffer malnutrition of various types, including metabolic bone disorder (MBD) which causes poor bone formation and could lead to their death. Specialized release methods are applied to integrate captive raised owlets back into the wild. Car collisions, electric wires, persecution, secondary poisoning and parasite infections such as Trichomonas gallinae are the major causes of mortality. Juveniles and newly fledged birds are particularly vulnerable.

Photographed at the Owl Rescue Centre in the North West Province of South Africa File:Juvenile Spotted Eagle Owl.jpgA juvenile spotted eagle-owl will develop its ear-tufts at about six months old A day- old spotted eagle-owlet in its 'nest' on the ground. Reproduction Spotted eagle-owls are monogamous, but will take a new mate shortly after the loss of a partner through death occurs. They are able to breed at around one year of age. They usually make their nest on the ground but have been known to nest on man-made structures such as window ledges of buildings or in Owl Houses. Breeding begins typically towards the end of July continuing to the first weeks of February. The female lays two to four eggs and does the incubation, leaving the nest only to eat what the male has brought for food. The incubation period lasts approximately 32 days. Spotted eagle-owlets will jump out of a nest that is off the ground at about five weeks of age and spend about ten days on the ground before they can fly. During this time, the owlets learn essential skills by mock-hunting and catching smaller prey such as insects. The parents still support feed the young owls during this stage by bringing larger prey such as rodents for the owlets to feed on. Owlets make a rasping noise when they are hungry that can be heard by the parents over far distances to alert them to the owlets location. Owlets are usually wrongfully removed from their parents during this phase by unknowing individuals who assume that the owlet is either injured or abandoned due to its inability to fly. The young owls can fly at around seven weeks of age, but continue to stay with the parents for several weeks after they have fledged. They have a life span of up to 10 years in the wild and up to 20 in captivity.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995. Executive producer Matthew Robinson reintroduced the character in 1999 as a businesswoman and a love interest for Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson). Storylines included a rocky marriage to Barry, contemplating abortion, almost sleeping with her brother-in-law, rekindling her affair with Ricky, a relationship with Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) and desperately trying to get Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) arrested for murdering Barry. Speed began to appear less frequently in 2003 due to personal reasons. Her departure was announced in early 2004, and Natalie left on 10 May 2004. Storylines=Backstory Natalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie. At age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993. 1994–1995 Mischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her. When Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in Basingstoke. 1999-2004 In 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self- confident business woman, running a dating agency. Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \\"Romantic Relations\\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after. Barry and Natalie marry (1999)170px Despite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on New Year's Eve in 1999, in a joint wedding with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). They live with Barry's father Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) and stepmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son Jack (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002—the birth is traumatic as Jack was born feet first. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity. Feeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave Albert Square with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in The Queen Victoria public house, Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in Scotland. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing. Suspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident. Creation and development=Casting 1994 was a \\"historic\\" year for EastEnders, as in April a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of Bianca (Patsy Palmer). The character was introduced under executive producer, Leonard Lewis. The actress Lucy Speed – seventeen at the time – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, they thought it was the quality they were looking for...Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until I walked through the door. So I got the part.” Personality Natalie as she appeared in 1994 The character has been described by EastEnders author, Rupert Smith, as an “eternal victim” – a female character who endures much misfortune and misery, but lacks the “pluck” of her “feistier sisters”. Early on in her narrative, Natalie was shown to be an insecure and lonely individual– a “gloomy kid” from a broken family with an uncaring, criticising and resentful mother, Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan). The character was often seen to be “shunted aside by stronger personalities”, such as her best friend Bianca – who was shown to bully and torment Natalie, telling her “that she was plain and wouldn't attract boys”, although in later years Natalie was shown to stand up to Bianca's bullying. Similarly, she was shown to be unsuccessful in relationships, falling for unsuitable men who ended up hurting her and settling in a “secure but uninspired” marriage to a mismatched, immature partner, Barry Evans. She was frequently shown to feel constrained and trapped by her marriage and motherhood – her initial reluctance to be a mother stemming from her own unhappy childhood. Though the character occasionally showed “a rare flash of spirit”, the results were usually detrimental – an affair with her “first true love”, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), ended the character's marriage and left her to face “a dreary future as a single mother.” Lucy Speed has commented on her character's personality: “she's a thinker and quite vulnerable, but she's grown up a lot. She's also had storylines where she's dealt with family skeletons and she did find a man who was able to give her stability and the chance for her to grow up a bit. Ultimately though, I hope that I've shown that who she is now explains who she was then…she's gone from being a young girl with zero confidence in herself to a young woman with a certain measure of confidence, back to someone with zero confidence. Life doesn't go easy on her but she's got strength. She's a feisty little thing and she gets on with things.” Love triangle and initial departure Initially, Natalie's principal purpose in the serial was to be Bianca Jackson's “put-upon sidekick” – Bianca was already an established character, having been introduced two months prior to Natalie's first appearance. The most notable storyline featuring Natalie during her initial stint in EastEnders was her affair with Bianca's boyfriend, Ricky. On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 16 Feb 1995; 17.0 million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend. The aftermath of the storyline led to Natalie's departure from the serial. On-screen Ricky discovered that Natalie orchestrated Bianca's discovery of their affair and finished with her, and in the midst of Bianca's wrath, Natalie fled from Walford in shame on 23 February 1995. Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed had decided to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was reportedly “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” Reintroduction and marriage to Barry Evans After a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented “It was good timing. He thought I and the character fit the bill.” Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed. A friendship was also re-established between the characters Natalie and Bianca in a special four-hander episode – although “the closeness was never quite the same”. Natalie's relationship with Barry Evans- frequently described as a “bumbling buffoon” – was central to the character upon her return to the serial. Speed has explained her character's initial attraction to Barry: \\"I think it has a lot to do with her childhood. Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.” =Millennium wedding= The biggest storyline involving Barry and Natalie in 1999 was their joint double wedding with the characters Ian Beale and Melanie Healy (Adam Woodyatt and Tamzin Outhwaite) – the lead up to which included a hen/stag night celebration episode, which was filmed on-location in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The episode evoked criticism by the Broadcasting Standards Commission for its inclusion of “almost relentless drunken and promiscuous behaviour, sexual innuendo and drug-taking, before the watershed”, which included Natalie having to acquire three love bites from strangers. The BBC defended the episode, claiming that its content would have “come as no surprise to viewers” and adding that the depiction of this behaviour conformed to an EastEnders tradition – that questionable conduct \\"only leads to further trouble…One character's quest for drugs led to embarrassment and nausea and a drinking binge led to the calling off of [Barry and Natalie’s] wedding while the prospects for another became bleaker.\\" Natalie and Barry's screen wedding was featured as part of the Millennium Eve episodes, which drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: \\"This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square.\\" The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revellers”. =Abortion= In 2001, a pregnancy was written into the character's narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed by the prospect of being a mother and planned to have an abortion. Speed commented \\"Natalie desperately wants a baby but the thought of becoming a mother makes her unhappy. Her family background is so awful she doesn't want to make the same mistake her mother made, but feels the odds are stacked against her and Barry.\\" Viewers saw a “devastated Barry” react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) – the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie's saga and scenes between Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An EastEnders spokesman said: \\"We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama. All four actors give incredible performances.\\" The following episode Barry was seen to chase Natalie to the abortion clinic, where he persuaded her to go through with the pregnancy. The scenes between Natalie and Barry have been described as some of “the most powerful moments in soap, with the couple battling to decide the fate of their unborn baby”. The character was seen to give birth to son Jack in January 2002 and her decision to keep her baby in spite of her initial determination to abort has been mocked by Susannah Nightingale – columnist for the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) women's campaign. She sarcastically comments “how lucky that she didn't go through with that patently psychotic urge for an abortion when she first realised she was pregnant […] It's funny, because Nat seemed so sure at the time: she wasn't ready for a baby, she needed to establish her career and move out of her husband's family home before becoming a mother. Perfectly reasonable, you might think […] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew – thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\\". Nightingale suggested that the storyline \\"echoed\\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \\"subtle\\" reinforcement of an \\"underlying implication\\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right. She comments, \\"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment – such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point – and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure – come on, what do you know?\\". =Adultery= Natalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen). In the New Year's Eve episode, she is shown to rekindle a secret “steamy affair” with old flame, Ricky, which continued into 2003. Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to feel very strongly indeed about someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling. When Natalie was younger she was easily seduced, and a little bit of that remains. She can be easily swayed if someone is nice.\\" The storyline reached its climax in March 2003. On-screen the character's plans to abscond with Ricky and her son (on the night of her surprise birthday party) were thwarted by Barry's discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and would do anything to make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opts to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he has recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha. Departure (2004) The character's second exit was the climax to a storyline that has been described as one of the show's “most dramatic”. Natalie's ex-husband Barry remarried and was killed by his new bride Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) on their honeymoon. The character is embroiled in a bid to uncover Janine as Barry's killer, and becomes romantically involved with the character Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) – Janine's repentant accomplice in Barry's downfall, who was also her former lover. After discovering the truth from Paul, Natalie realises she is powerless to bring Janine to justice, and decides to leave the Square in March 2004. The character returned briefly in May to ensure Janine received her comeuppance and made her final screen appearance on 10 May 2004. Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed had decided to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She comments “'I'd been back for five years and had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the door was shut behind me. Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.” To mark the character's exit a special documentary was aired in March 2004, entitled EastEnders Revealed: Natalie Evans. The programme looked back over 10 years of the character's time in the soap and featured interviews from Speed and tributes from her former castmates Shaun Williamson (Barry), Charlie Brooks (Janine), Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Jackson), Gary Beadle (Paul), Pam St. Clement (Pat) and Tony Caunter (Roy). Reception In 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of teenage viewers of EastEnders, using the character Natalie as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \\"girl-culture\\" – attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public – manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \\"nice person\\" in contrast to Bianca, \\"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women. Linda Ruth Williams, author of The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema, was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the erotic thriller film genre. In an episode that aired in 2000, Natalie's husband Barry suggested that he and Natalie get intimate in a video store. Natalie retorted that \\"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex. Ruth Williams suggested that Natalie's casual dismissal of the erotic thriller genre as \\"lurid\\" was a discourse shared by the general population; she stated that witnessing this scene inspired her to pen the aforementioned book, which was the first of its kind to examine the film genre. Natalie Evans peaked at 52 on EastEnders: The Greatest Cliffhangers in 2010.{ In popular culture In 2002 the character was featured in a spoof of the Michael Jackson hit video, Thriller, which was made as part of the annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Shaun Williamson as Barry played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed as Natalie took on Ola Ray’s role as his date. Unlike the original video – where Jackson was seen to turn into a zombie – the spoof saw Natalie transformed into the walking dead. A dozen cast-members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. Speed has commented “I really enjoyed that. We were there on our day off but it was brilliant fun. I used to be a dancer and to be able to do some moves on the Square was good. We all wanted to look as horrific and disgusting as possible. Shaun split his trousers while doing it as well. I think they were really tight though.” References External links  * *Walford Gazette interview with Lucy Speed Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional bookmakers Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional salespeople ","title":"Natalie Evans"},{"id":"4133041","text":"Baron Berwick, of Attingham Park in the County of Shropshire, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1784 for Noel Hill, who had earlier represented Shrewsbury and Shropshire in Parliament. He was the son of Thomas Hill (originally Thomas Harwood), son of Thomas Harwood, a draper, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire. His paternal grandmother was Margaret, daughter of Rowland Hill, sister of Sir Richard Hill and aunt of Sir Rowland Hill, 1st Baronet, ancestor of the Viscounts Hill. Hill's father had assumed the surname of Hill in lieu of his patronymic on succeeding to the Hill estates through his mother. Lord Berwick was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He was a patron of art. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was a diplomat and politician. In 1824 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Noel, which was that of his maternal grandfather, William Noel, younger son of Sir John Noel, 4th Baronet, of Kirkby Mallory (see Noel Baronets). Lord Berwick died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He was a clergyman. He also assumed the additional surname of Noel by Royal licence in 1824. Two of his sons, the fifth and sixth Barons, both succeeded in the title. Both died unmarried and on the death of the sixth Baron the title passed to his nephew, the seventh Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Thomas Henry Noel-Hill, younger son of the fourth Baron. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the eighth Baron. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. Thomas Noel-Hill, younger brother of the seventh Baron. 8th Baron had no children.

A view of the park's corners Another view with the T. T. Wentworth, Jr. Florida State Museum in the background The Plaza Ferdinand VII is an outdoor garden and park in the Historic Pensacola Village area of downtown Pensacola, Florida. It is located on Palafox Street between Government and Zaragoza Streets. It was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain, the King of Spain between 1813 and 1833. A National Historic Landmark, it is the site of the formal transfer of Florida to United States jurisdiction in 1821. Description Plaza Ferdinand VII is bounded on the north by Government Street, the east by Jefferson Street, the south by Zarragossa Street, and the west by Palafox Street. About in size, it is a grassy area, dotted with trees, and criss-crossed by paved walkways. It has three principal features: a fountain near the northern end, an obelisk at the center, and a memorial to Andrew Jackson near the southern end. The central obelisk is a memorial to railroad baron and mayor of Pensacola William Dudley Chipley. The plaza forms part of a street plan laid out in 1765, when Pensacola was the capital of the British colony of West Florida. Originally the central park of that plan was somewhat larger, but significant portions were subdivided and sold off in 1802, when West Florida was again a Spanish colony. Historical significance Under the Adams–Onís Treaty, negotiated in 1819, Spain agreed to cede Florida to the United States. Spain did not formally ratify the treaty until 1821. In March of that year, Andrew Jackson was appointed its first territorial governor in March, and was given the task of overseeing the transfer of the territories of East and West Florida from Spanish authorities. A formal ceremony was held in St. Augustine on July 10, in which the chief United States representative was Jackson's deputy, Robert Butler. Jackson attended the ceremony held on this plaza on July 21, in which the Spanish flag was lowered and the American flag raised. He then made a speech to the townspeople, informing them that the land was now the Florida Territory, and that Pensacola would be its capital. The bust of Jackson now stands at the spot where he was formally inaugurated as territorial governor. The bust was donated in 1935 by the Pensacola Historic Preservation Society. The plaza was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and As such, it was automatically included in the National Register of Historic Places when that program began in 1966. In 1989, the plaza was listed in A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, published by the University of Florida Press.A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, 1989, Gainesville: University of Florida Press, p. 7, Archaeologists, in 2002, discovered evidence of British structures previously not known to have existed in that area.

Two music videos were filmed, for the songs \\"Ouvi Dizer\\" and \\"Capitão Romance\\". Recording and production The recording of Ornatos' second studio album was a difficult one. The band rejected \\"dozens of songs\\" during the album's development sessions with producer Mário Barreiros, with the band's members becoming so frustrated that they expressed a sudden desire of giving up on the project completely after just two months of production. Some of these rejected songs, such as \\"Como Afundar\\", \\"Há-de Encarnar\\", \\"Rio de Raiva\\" and \\"Devagar\\" were later included in the 2011 release of a CD box containing both studio albums and a third CD, named Inéditos/Raridades, with previously unreleased songs. Years later, Barreiros said he had identified that frustration as merely the \\"permanent insatisfaction of the great artists\\" that allowed them to push their art further away. Composition O Monstro Precisa de Amigos is noted to be a much more mature and versatile album than the band's debut Cão!, offering a more meditative and polished sound. For their second album, the band could count with the guest participation of Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes and Portuguese musician and actor Vítor Espadinha. The Violent Femmes were a long-time reference for Ornatos, and their lead singer Gano shared vocal duties with Manel Cruz in the single \\"Capitão Romance\\", in which he sang in Portuguese. Espadinha contributed with the recitation of a poem that can be heard at the end of \\"Ouvi Dizer\\", another of the album's singles which has been called a \\"post-modern classic\\" by some media outlets. Reception The album was considered by the Portuguese music magazine Blitz as the best album of the year in 1999, with Cruz being awarded the best vocalist prize and Ornatos Violeta the best Portuguese ensemble of that year. O Monstro Precisa de Amigos had sold 15 586 copies as of October 2002, which allowed the album to be certified as a silver record in Portugal. Years later, the album is considered to have turned Ornatos Violeta into one of the most successful rock bands in Portugal. In June 2017, the album was included in Blitz's list of the 30 best Portuguese albums of the last 30 years. To signal the band's 20 years anniversary, O Monstro Precisa de Amigos was re-released on 5 December 2011 along with Cão! and a CD with previously unreleased work. This CD box release was certified as a platinum record in Portugal. O Monstro Precisa de Amigos was released for the first time as a vinyl record on 5 February 2012, with Rastilho Records providing a limited and numbered edition of 500 copies of both O Monstro and Cão!.

Just as tubulins and actins, the other major cytoskeletal proteins, have prokaryotic homologs in, respectively, the FtsZ and MreB proteins, intermediate filaments are linked to the crescentin protein. Some of its homologs are erroneously labelled Chromosome segregation protein ParA. This protein family is found in Caulobacter and Methylobacterium. Role in cell shape Crescentin was recently discovered by Christine Jacobs-Wagner in Caulobacter crescentus (now vibrioides), an aquatic bacterium which uses its crescent-shaped cells for enhanced motility. The crescentin protein is located on the concave face of these cells and appears to be necessary for their shape, as mutants lacking the protein form rod- shaped cells. To influence the shape of the Caulobacter cells, the helices of crescentin filaments associate with the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane on one lateral side of the cell. This induces a curved cell shape in younger cells, which are shorter than the helical pitch of crescentin, but induces a spiral shape in older, longer cells. Protein structure Like eukaryotic intermediate filaments, crescentin organizes into filaments and is present in a helical structure in the cell. Crescentin is necessary for both shapes of the Caulobacter prokaryote (vibroid/crescent-shape and helical shape, which it may adopt after a long stationary phase). The crescentin protein has 430 residues; its sequence mostly consists of a pattern of 7 repeated residues which form a coiled-coil structure. The DNA sequence of the protein has sections very similar to the eukaryotic keratin and lamin proteins, mostly involving the coiled-coil structure. Researchers Ausmees et al. recently proved that, like animal intermediate filament proteins, crescentin has a central rod made up of four coiled-coil segments. Both intermediate filament and crescentin proteins have a primary sequence including four α-helical segments along with non-α-helical linker domains. An important difference between crescentin and animal intermediate filament proteins is that crescentin lacks certain consensus sequence elements at the ends of the rod domain which are conserved in animal lamin and keratin proteins. The protein has been divided into a few subdomains organized similarly to eukaryotic IF proteins. Not every researcher is convinced that it is a homolog of intermediate filaments, suggesting instead that the similarity might have arose via convergent evolution. Assembly of filaments Eukaryotic intermediate filament proteins assemble into filaments of 8-15 nm within the cell without the need for energy input, that is, no need for ATP or GTP. Ausmees et al. continued their crescentin research by testing whether the protein could assemble into filaments in this manner in vitro. They found that crescentin proteins were indeed able to form filaments about 10 nm wide, and that some of these filaments organized laterally into bundles, just as eukaryotic intermediate filaments do. The similarity of crescentin protein to intermediate filament proteins suggests an evolutionary linkage between these two cytoskeletal proteins. Like eukaryotic intermediate filaments, the filament built from crescentin is elastic. Individual proteins dissociate slowly, making the structure somewhat stiff and slow to remodel. Strain does not induce hardening of the structure, unlike eukaryotic IFs that do.

They developed primarily for the Atari 8-bit computers, then later the Commodore 64 and other systems. Synapse is primarily known for a series of highly regarded action games such as Fort Apocalypse, Blue Max, The Pharaoh's Curse, and Shamus, including some unusual games not based on established concepts, like Necromancer and Alley Cat. The company also sold databases and a 6502 assembler, as well as a series of productivity applications which led to its downfall. Synapse was founded by Ihor Wolosenko and Ken Grant. The company was purchased by Broderbund in late 1984. Action games Synapse's first releases were for the Atari 8-bit computers, starting in 1981. Some of their early games were based on elements of contemporary arcade games. Protector (1981) uses elements of Defender, and Dodge Racer (1981) is a clone of Sega's Head On. Chicken (1982) has the same basic concept as Kaboom! for the Atari 2600, which itself is similar to the arcade game Avalanche. Nautilus (1982) features a split-screen so two players can play at once. In one-player mode the user controls a submarine, the Nautilus, in the lower screen while the computer controls a destroyer, the Colossus, in the upper screen. Similar to Atari's Combat, in two-player mode another player takes control of the destroyer. The same basic system was later re-used in other games, including Shadow World. Survivor (1982) supports up to four simultaneous players, a side effect of the Atari 400 and Atari 800 having four joystick ports. Each player commands a different part of a single spaceship. In single-player mode it operates like the ship in Asteroids, while in two player mode one drives and the other fires in any direction. In an interview with Antic, Wolosenko agreed that 1982's Shamus was the beginning of Synapse's reputation for quality products. Other high quality, better advertised games followed in 1982-3. These include Necromancer, Rainbow Walker, Blue Max, Fort Apocalypse, Alley Cat, and The Pharaoh's Curse. It was during this period that the company branched out and started supporting other systems, especially the Commodore 64, which became a major platform. Many of Synapse's games made their way to the UK as part of the initial wave of U.S. Gold-distributed imports (under the \\"Synsoft\\" imprint). Some were also converted to run on the more popular UK home computers, such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Synapse was an early developer for the unsuccessful graphics-accelerated Mindset PC project and created the first-person game Vyper (1984). Ports and re-releases Synapse developed an official port of the arcade game Zaxxon for the Commodore 64. The Atari port was from Datasoft. Synapse also published Encounter! in 1983, which was originally released in the UK by Novagen Software without the exclamation mark in the name. Utilities and productivity software Although it is for their success with arcade-style games that they are primarily remembered, Synapse started out selling database software for the Atari 8-bit computers. In 1982 Synapse released SynAssembler, a 6502 development system which was much faster than Atari's offerings at the time. SynAssembler is a port of the S-C Assembler II Version 4.0 from the Apple II. The port was done by Steve Hales, who also wrote a number of games for Synapse. Synapse was developing a series of home productivity and financial applications: SynFile+ (written in Forth by Steve Ahlstrom and Dan Moore of The 4th Works), SynCalc, SynChron, SynComm, SynStock, and SynTrend. Interactive fiction Some time before their demise, Synapse had started work on interactive fiction games (or as they called them, \\"Electronic Novels\\"). The games were all based on a parser called \\"BTZ\\" (Better Than Zork), written by William Mataga and Steve Hales. Seven games were written using the system but only four released,\\"Synapse Software\\", Adventureland the best-known being the critically acclaimed Mindwheel. Downfall By early 1984 Synapse was the largest third- party provider of Atari 8-bit software, but 65% of its sales came from the Commodore market. The company ran into financial difficulty. According to Steve Hales they had taken a calculated risk in developing the series of productivity applications and had entered into a collaboration with Atari, Inc. When Jack Tramiel purchased Atari's consumer division from Warner Communications, he refused to pay for the 40,000 units of software that had been shipped. Thrown into a cash crisis, Synapse was purchased by Broderbund Software in late 1984. Although the intention had been to keep Synapse going, the market had changed, and they were unable to make money from the electronic novels. Approximately one year after the takeover, Broderbund closed Synapse down. Software published by Synapse Games separated by a slash were sold together as \\"Double Plays,\\" with one being a bonus game on the other side of the disk. Rainbow Walker was initially sold by itself, and the second game added later. Showcase Software At the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, Synapse announced it would publish games for the VIC-20. These were a mix of original titles and ports and were sold under the name Showcase Software. Only some of the announced games were released. * Astro Patrol * Salmon Run - originally published in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family through the Atari Program Exchange * Squeeze ReferencesExternal links * Scans and information on Synapse's Atari products Category:Atari 8-bit family Category:Defunct software companies of the United States Category:Defunct video game companies of the United States * Category:1984 disestablishments in California Category:American companies disestablished in 1984 ","title":"Synapse Software"},{"id":"4133124","text":"The Deep was a short-lived American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods. The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts. Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \\"psychedelic\\" in its title. Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California),Paul Liberatore, \\"Artist-musician Marcus Uzilevsky, aka Rusty Evans, dies at 78\\", Marin Independent Journal, december 13, 2015. Retrieved 6 June 2016 was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist. Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans – Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) – and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played. In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album. They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200. In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time. The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep. While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \\"psychedelic\\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name. Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \\"Deep\\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967. After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music, and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca. He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band. Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.

It emerged in southern coastal areas in the first half of the 17th century. In the last quarter of the 18th century madak was phased out by raw opium. The prohibition of madak in 1729 may have been a contributing factor to the increase in popularity of smoking pure opium. Raw opium was introduced in China by Arab merchants. Rather than taking bitter raw opium orally, the Chinese attempted smoking opium mixed with other substances. According to Dikotter et al., smoking opium blended with tobacco was introduced in China by the Dutch traders between 1624 and 1660. Madak was prepared by blending opium from Java with domestic Chinese hemp and herbs, boiling the mix in pans and, finally, mixing with tobacco. It was smoked in bamboo pipes with coir fibre filter.Dikotter et al., p. 33. The new addiction was limited to coastal territories around Taiwan Strait; further spread was hampered by the civil war that accompanied the fall of the Ming Dynasty. The new Qing Dynasty government was not aware of madak until 1683.Dikotter et al., p. 32. The lucrative opium business continued spreading along the coast of Southern China, although exact chronology of this spread remains unknown. By 1720 the government saw madak smoking as a social evil that has corrupted not just the lowest classes, but the \\"good families\\" too.Dikotter et al., p. 34. Smoking dens, where people congregated at night, were deemed as dangerous as heretical cults and political conspiracies. In 1729 the Yongzheng Emperor banned recreational smoking of madak. Medicinal use remained permitted.Dikotter et al., p. 36. According to Dikotter et al., the prohibition targeted madak smoking not as such, but as a dangerous form of unacceptable social life feared by the Forbidden City (and thus was akin to A Counterblaste to Tobacco written a century earlier by James I of England).Dikotter et al., p. 35. Madak had a \\"very narrow consumer base\\" confined to Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan. Peak consumption, according to Dutch records, was under 12 tonnes of opium per annum. The British East India Company complied with the ban until 1780; the Portuguese ships continued small-scale deliveries of \\"medicinal\\" opium. In 1780 the East India Company faced a dire financial crisis and resorted to opium smuggling .Dikotter et al., p. 37. Their opium did not sell at all: only 15% of the English shipment found customers within China. However, in the next two decades consumption of opium rapidly grew. The Chinese replaced madak with raw opium; madak remained in limited use by the Malay people. In 1793 the British assumed a monopoly on now profitable opium trading.Dikotter et al., p. 38. The Peking government banned opium in 1796, temporarily driving the market underground. Historian Xiao Yishan reasoned that the surge in opium consumption was directly influenced by the 1729 prohibition. According to Dikotter et al., exact causes of the change remain unknown.Dikotter et al., p. 38. See also * History of opium in China  Footnotes  References  * Dikötter, F., Laaman, L. & Xun, Z.

She now lives in Mittenwald in Bavaria. She was most successful in the 2002-03 season, when she was the first German to win the women's overall Biathlon World Cup. She is also a three-times world champion and three-times Olympic silver medalist. She married the Austrian biathlete Günther Beck on 24 July 2008 and is now known as Martina Beck. She has one daughter named Hilde (born 1 April 2011). Career Beck's talent was discovered in fourth grade, when she beat out male competition up to three years older than herself in a cross-country skiing event. Her father, Martin Glagow, is a former army officer and ski technician: he waxed Martina's skis until the end of the 2004-05 season, and was also wax technician for the British biathlon team from 2000 until his retirement in 2011. Although Beck stands only tall, she was a strong skier, but was renowned for her shooting ability: she was regularly among the female athletes with the highest accuracy rate, leading the shooting statistics in the 2003-04 season with a rate of 89 percent. Her father attributed her shooting ability to family inheritance: he had won multiple divisional shooting championships, and he noted that his father was also a good marksman. She became a member of the German World Cup team in 2000, when she impressed by winning an event in her first year and even finished third in the mass start World Cup standings. Later, she became the first German biathlete to win the women's Biathlon World Cup in the 2002-03 season, alongside the pursuit World Cup; in 2005-06, she finished third in the overall standings and won the mass start standings. In 2007-08, she was the best biathlete in the individual discipline. As of 17 March 2008, she has won a total of 12 individual world cup events. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Beck won three silver medals: one in the sprint competition, one in the pursuit, and one in the relay. At world championships, she has won a total of eleven medals: she was World Champion thrice, in 2003 in the pursuit (together with Sandrine Bailly) and in 2007 and 2008 in the relay.

While never broadly accepted, at one time it was a scientifically plausible alternative to general relativity. However, after further experimental and theoretical consideration, the theory is now generally regarded as obsolete. Principal features Whitehead developed his theory of gravitation by considering how the world line of a particle is affected by those of nearby particles. He arrived at an expression for what he called the \\"potential impetus\\" of one particle due to another, which modified Newton's law of universal gravitation by including a time delay for the propagation of gravitational influences. Whitehead's formula for the potential impetus involves the Minkowski metric, which is used to determine which events are causally related and to calculate how gravitational influences are delayed by distance. The potential impetus calculated by means of the Minkowski metric is then used to compute a physical spacetime metric g_{\\\\mu u}, and the motion of a test particle is given by a geodesic with respect to the metric g_{\\\\mu u}. Unlike the Einstein field equations, Whitehead's theory is linear, in that the superposition of two solutions is again a solution. This implies that Einstein's and Whitehead's theories will generally make different predictions when more than two massive bodies are involved. Clifford M. Will argued that Whitehead's theory features a prior geometry. Under Will's presentation (which was inspired by John Lighton Synge's interpretation of the theory), Whitehead's theory has the curious feature that electromagnetic waves propagate along null geodesics of the physical spacetime (as defined by the metric determined from geometrical measurements and timing experiments), while gravitational waves propagate along null geodesics of a flat background represented by the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. The gravitational potential can be expressed entirely in terms of waves retarded along the background metric, like the Liénard–Wiechert potential in electromagnetic theory. A cosmological constant can be introduced by changing the background metric to a de Sitter or anti-de Sitter metric. This was first suggested by G. Temple in 1923. Temple's suggestions on how to do this were criticized by C. B. Rayner in 1955. Will's work was disputed by Dean R. Fowler, who argued that Will's presentation of Whitehead's theory contradicts Whitehead's philosophy of nature. For Whitehead, the geometric structure of nature grows out of the relations among what he termed \\"actual occasions\\". Fowler claimed that a philosophically consistent interpretation of Whitehead's theory makes it an alternate, mathematically equivalent, presentation of general relativity. In turn, Jonathan Bain argued that Fowler's criticism of Will was in error. Experimental tests Whitehead's theory is equivalent with the Schwarzschild metric and makes the same predictions as general relativity regarding the four classical solar system tests (gravitational red shift, light bending, perihelion shift, Shapiro time delay), and was regarded as a viable competitor of general relativity for several decades. In 1971, Will argued that Whitehead's theory predicts a periodic variation in local gravitational acceleration 200 times longer than the bound established by experiment. Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's textbook Gravitation states that Will demonstrated \\"Whitehead's theory predicts a time- dependence for the ebb and flow of ocean tides that is completely contradicted by everyday experience\\". Fowler argued that different tidal predictions can be obtained by a more realistic model of the galaxy. Reinhardt and Rosenblum claimed that the disproof of Whitehead's theory by tidal effects was \\"unsubstantiated\\". Chiang and Hamity argued that Reinhardt and Rosenblum's approach \\"does not provide a unique space-time geometry for a general gravitation system\\", and they confirmed Will's calculations by a different method. In 1989, a modification of Whitehead's theory was proposed that eliminated the unobserved sidereal tide effects. However, the modified theory did not allow the existence of black holes.

As a nitpicker Farrand first became a Star Trek nitpicker when watching a scene in the 1990 Star Trek: The Next Generation episode The Offspring. In the scene, the character Wesley Crusher speaks to his mother, Dr. Beverly Crusher using his communicator badge. After responding to Dr. Crusher's reminder to get a haircut, Wesley utters a sarcastic remark, but without tapping his comm badge to terminate the connection, leading Farrand to wonder to Dr. Crusher heard the remark. This sparked a spirited discussion between Farrand and his Trekker friend as to how the communicators worked, and the inconsistencies in their depicted usage in the series. In 1990, Farrand decided to try writing fiction, but could not find anyone to read his work. Because the only agent willing to represent him dealt only with nonfiction works, Farrand decided to attempt writing nonfiction in order to develop a reputation on which a career writing fiction could be based. A book producer liked Farrand's idea for a Next Generation nitpicker's guide, and so Farrand spent two years conducting careful analysis of the first six seasons of that series, spending eight to nine hours a day for months watching each episode multiple times, composing a tongue-in-cheek analysis of the plot holes, continuity errors and other trivia in the series. In 1993 Dell Publishing published the first guide, The Nitpicker's Guide for Next Generation Trekkers. By 1994 nearly 800,000 copies had been sold, and four printings published. From 1994 to 1997, similar guides followed annually, including Guides for Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and The X-Files, along with a second Next Generation volume. Watching the episodes and movies of each series in order to compile each Guide took about seven months, leaving Farrand five months out of the year to learn how to write fiction.Message Board Message Although exhaustive in their attention to detail, the Guides were not intended as critiques of the series' episodes or movies, but lighthearted musings that Farrand explained with the philosophy, \\"All nitpickers shall perform their duties with lightheartedness and good cheer,\\" explaining that nitpicking should be about having fun with one's favorite television shows, not pointing fingers and assigning blame. Farrand solicited submissions from readers, who then became members of the \\"Nitpicker's Guild.\\"Farrand, Phil (May 28, 1999). \\"Current Guild Statistics as of May 28, 1999\\". Nitcentral. He began sending out newsletters in 1994 in order to keep in touch with the Guild,\\"Continuing Communications\\". Nitcentral. Retrieved January 13, 2016. beginning with the April 1994 edition. The Guild numbered 7,450 members from 32 countries as of May 28, 1999. Farrand decided to create an online version of the newsletter called Nitpicker Central, or Nitcentral; this took the form of an HTML feature called \\"This Week at Nitcentral\\", and debuted in November 1997. The hardcopy version of the newsletter also continued, with a total of 17 issues published intermittently, ceasing with issue dated October 1998, which coincided with the creation of Nitcentral's message boards, using free Discus software.Message Board Message Farrand was Nitcentral's first and sole moderator at first, with the site covering only four topics, the live action Star Trek television programs that had been produced up to then: Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager. By June 2009, the topics listed on the main Topics page numbered 89.\\"Topics\\". Nitcentral. Retrieved January 13, 2016. Farrand planned to release a Nitpicker's Guide for Star Wars in April 1999, one month before Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, but publishers became wary of publishing media tie-in products as a result copyright infringement lawsuits brought against similar products. Although the lawsuits did not name Farrand's Guides as an example -- and in fact, even cited the Guides used as an example of what was legal -- Del Rey ceased publishing Farrand's Guides, leaving Nitcentral as the sole ongoing outlet for the Guild. As the site expanded, Farrand assigned dozens of moderators to oversee the site's various topics. Although Farrand has since stepped down as a moderator of day-to-day activities, he remains the ultimate authority on the site and will step in occasionally to resolve matters of severe conflict among visitors and moderators, who refer to him as \\"The Chief\\". Church work Following the cancellation of the Guides, Farrand returned to the computer consulting industry, hoping to begin writing his first novel in his free time. Those plans changed when his wife Lynette, who had served as music minister at their church for 16 years, decided to take a two-year break. Farrand, a devout Christian who mentions Jesus Christ in the acknowledgments of all his books, agreed to serve as interim music minister; combined with his consultation job, this consumed all of his time, and he worked seven days a week. He eventually stepped down as music minister on September 28, 2003. As a novelist Farrand's initial attempts to publish through a small publisher in August 2003 were not fruitful, and he ultimately decided to self-publish through on-demand publisher Xlibris.Phil Farrand. \\"This Year at Nitcentral\\".

Twenty years into the new rule, a resistance fighter named Avery Foster decides to confront the new rulers, including Judge Thomas Stone, whose brutal interpretations of the new law have oppressed anyone daring to rebel. Farrand wrote the novel in part to explore the question of how one can distinguish between the divine and extraterrestrials, and added a topic to Nitcentral for discussion of the novel. In 2007, Farrand published Grumpy Old Prophets: A Christmas Fable for Adults. He also began a new Internet provider venture called Zarks, providing high-speed Internet access to the rural areas in and around Greene County, Missouri.Zarks.net Personal life Farrand lives with his wife Lynette and his daughter Elizabeth in Springfield, Missouri.

The metro was the fourth system constructed in Ukraine, after the Kyiv , Kharkiv and Kryvyy Rih metro systems, respectively, when it opened on December 29, 1995. The metro was the fifteenth built in the former Soviet Union region, and the first to open after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Dnipro Metro consists of one line and 6 stations. The line starts at the Vokzalna station, near the city's central railway station in the east and ends at the Pokrovska station in the western part of the city. The system is open from 05:30 to 23:00. Ridership on the metro has steadily declined since its opening in 1995; in 2013, the metro carried only 7.51 million passengers (compared to 18.2 million in 1995). Initially, the metro trains carried five train cars each, but as the passenger ridership declined, the number of cars was reduced to three. The price for a single ride is currently 6 UAH; either plastic token or transit cards are used at the entrance gates. Current expansion plans are projected to increase the number of stations to nine by 2023. History With the help from the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Vladimir Shcherbitsky, in 1979 the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union affirmed the Central Committee of the Communist Party's action to allow the Gosplan (government planning agency) and the communication and transportation construction ministries to conduct research on construction a metropolitan system in Dnipropetrovsk. In 1980, four lines were planned with one line parallel to the Dnieper with nine stations: Kommunarov, Prospect Sovobdy, Mayakovskaya, Vozrozhdenie, Kalininskaya, Petrovsky Square, Teatralna, Lenin Square and \\"Student\\". The second line was planned to pass through residential areas and industrial enterprises of the southern right- bank part of the city, Lenin Square and residential areas on the left bank of the Dnieper. The third should have connected through \\"the center quarters of the southwestern part with the north on the left bank of the Dnieper.\\" The fourth should have run along the left bank and cross residential areas and industrial areas of the northern part of the city. The metro is being designed in Dnepropetrovsk (Metrostroy magazine No.5 1980), Dnipro Metropoliten (unfficial website of Dnipro Metro) After the Teatralna, Tsentralna, and Muzeina will be completed the first metro line of Dnipro as it was envisioned in 1980 will be completed, in November 2018 city authorities expected these three new stations to be opened by the summer of 2023. On March 15, 1982 following a decree by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union the Dnipro Metro was included in the list of first priority construction projects. It was planned to finish it by the 12th five-year plan. But soon after the death of Leonid Brezhnev on 10 November 1982 in the country ended up in economic hardship and financing of the project was reduced. In 1988 Mikhail Gorbachev when was visiting the city promised the residents to help with finishing of the projects, yet his promises were left unrealized. With dissolution of the Soviet Union, the projected was halted. In 1994 it was decided to force the completion of the project and with the help of the chairman of regional council Pavlo Lazarenko these plans were realised when the system's first line, the Tsentralno-Zavodska Line, was opened to the public on December 29, 1995. The Dnipro Metro system was constructed following the typical Soviet metro construction format. Out of the six stations, five are located deep underground and one is placed near the surface. Four of the deep stations are single vaults built on Leningrad technology and one is a Pylon. The only shallow station is a pillar trispan. Owing to the economic recession of the early 1990s, the metro stations lack the same level of decoration and architectural integrity of those built in Soviet times. Future growth Three stations are currently under construction, which would expand the system from the Dnipro Central Railway Station (at Vokzalna) to the city centre; Teatralna (near the Theatre of Opera and Ballet), Tsentralna, and Muzeina (near the Museum of History). Construction on these three stations was restarted in late February 2011 after being completely halted on July 26, 2009. A lack of funding for the construction also was due to the fact that Dnipropetrovsk was not chosen as one of the host cities of the UEFA Euro 2012 football championship. The building site of the future metro station Teatralna in 2017 In June 2014, President Petro Poroshenko signed the 2014 budget into law which will allocate funding to the \\"Dnipropetrovskyi Metropoliten\\" company for the completion of the metro's line. The two new stations in the city centre, Teatralna and Tsentralna, were expected to be finished by 2015, whilst Muzeina was according to plans to be finished by 2016. Another station, \\"Parus\\", is planned for the western terminus of the Tsentralno-Zavodska Line. But construction did not start because the tender to select the contractor was stopped by the city council in August 2015. The metro is not being built in Dnipropetrovsk because Filatov and Korban require \\"kickbacks\\", - Pashchenko, Ukrainian News Agency (17 August 2015) In summer of 2016, the mayor of Dnipro Borys Filatov and representatives of the Limak Holding signed a contract to build the Dnipro subway. The active phase of works started in April of 2017. In November 2018, city authorities expected the three new stations to be opened by the summer of 2023. Dniprovsky City Council plans to open 3 new subway stations by summer 2023, Ukrainian News Agency (22 November 2018) In the beginning of 2019, it was announced that there were allocated some 1.4 billion (hryvnias) as a subvention from state budget.Finishing of the subway is one of the most important and the biggest dynamic projects of Dnipro (Добудова метрополітену – один із найважливіших та найбільш динамічних проектів Дніпра).

He is most well known for his role during the Battle of the Trench and was killed by Ali ibn Abi Talib.  Battle of the Trench  During the battle of the trench in 627 AD, the Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock.

Chemistry education (or chemical education) is the study of the teaching and learning of chemistry in all schools, colleges and universities. Topics in chemistry education might include understanding how students learn chemistry, how best to teach chemistry, and how to improve learning outcomes by changing teaching methods and appropriate training of chemistry instructors, within many modes, including classroom lecture, demonstrations, and laboratory activities. There is a constant need to update the skills of teachers engaged in teaching chemistry, and so chemistry education addresses this need.  Theories of education  There are at least four different philosophical perspectives that describe how the work in chemistry education is carried out. The first is what one might call a practitioner’s perspective, wherein the individuals who are responsible for teaching chemistry (teachers, instructors, professors) are the ones who ultimately define chemistry education by their actions. A second perspective is defined by a self-identified group of chemical educators, faculty members and instructors who, as opposed to declaring their primary interest in a typical area of laboratory research (organic, inorganic, biochemistry, etc.), take on an interest in contributing suggestions, essays, observations, and other descriptive reports of practice into the public domain, through journal publications, books, and presentations. Dr. Robert L. Lichter, then-Executive Director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, speaking in a plenary session at the 16th Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (recent BCCE meetings: ,), posed the question “why do terms like ‘chemical educator’ even exist in higher education, when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity, namely, ‘chemistry professor.’ One criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in or background about education to their jobs, and so lack any professional perspective on the teaching and learning enterprise, particularly discoveries made about effective teaching and how students learn. A third perspective is chemical education research (CER). Following the example of physics education research (PER), CER tends to take the theories and methods developed in pre-college science education research, which generally takes place in Schools of Education, and applies them to understanding comparable problems in post-secondary settings (in addition to pre-college settings). Like science education researchers, CER practitioners tend to study the teaching practices of others as opposed to focusing on their own classroom practices. Chemical education research is typically carried out in situ using human subjects from secondary and post- secondary schools. Chemical education research utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Quantitative methods typically involve collecting data that can then be analyzed using various statistical methods. Qualitative methods include interviews, observations, journaling, and other methods common to social science research. Finally, there is an emergent perspective called The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). Although there is debate on how to best define SoTL, one of the primary practices is for mainstream faculty members (organic, inorganic, biochemistry, etc.) to develop a more informed view of their practices, how to carry out research and reflection on their own teaching, and about what constitutes deep understanding in student learning. Fear of chemistry classes Demonstration in a chemistry class Chemistry courses are required for many university students, especially for students who are studying science. Some students find chemistry classes and lab work stressful. This anxiety has been called chemophobia. Fears commonly center on academic performance, the difficulty of learning chemical equations, and fear of getting lab chemicals on the hands. Women students were more anxious than men. Previous exposure to learning chemistry was associated with lower anxiety. See also chemophobia for aversion to chemical compounds rather than chemistry as a subject in education. Academic journals There are many journals where papers related to chemistry education can be found or published. Historically, the circulation of many of these journals was limited to the country of publication. Some concentrate on chemistry at different education levels (schools vs. universities) while others cover all education levels. Most of these journals carry a mixture of articles that range from reports on classroom and laboratory practices to educational research. * Australian Journal of Education in Chemistry: Published by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute and covering both School and University education. * Chemistry Education Research and Practice (CERP): Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) CERP publishes research concerned with all aspects of chemistry education.

Born in Trivandrum, Kerala, to Tamil parents, he left for Europe as a youth, where he spent the rest of his active life as an Indian nationalist and revolutionary. Although his life was mired in controversies, including a squabble with Adolf Hitler, information on his life in Europe was sketchy in the immediate years after his death. More information has come out in recent years. Chempakaraman Pillai is credited with the coining of the salutation and slogan \\"Jai Hind\\" in the pre-independence days of India. The slogan is still widely used in India. Early life Pillai was born into a Tamil family in Trivandrum, capital of the former kingdom of Travancore in the modern state of Kerala. His parents, Chinnaswami Pillai and Nagammal, hailed from Nanjilnadu (in present-day Kanyakumari District). In Europe Pillai attended a technical institute, pursuing a diploma in Engineering. After the outbreak of the First World War, he founded the International Pro-India Committee and based its headquarters in Zürich, appointing himself president in September 1914. During the same period an Indian Independence Committee was formed in Berlin by a group of Indian expatriates in Germany. This latter group was composed of Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Mahatma Gandhi, Bhupendranath Dutta, A. Raman Pillai, Taraknath Das, Maulavi Barkatullah, Chandrakant Chakravarty, M. Prabhakar, Birendra Sarkar, and Heramba Lal Gupta. In October 1914, Pillai moved to Berlin and joined the Berlin Committee, merging it with his International Pro-India Committee as the guiding and controlling institution for all pro-Indian revolutionary activities in Europe. Lala Har Dayal was also persuaded to join the movement. Both of them cooperated with the German Intelligence Bureau for the East and helped creating German propaganda directed at Indian PoWs in German camps, particularly the Halbmondlager. Soon branches sprang up in Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Washington, as well as in many other parts of Europe and the Americas. SMS Emden Bombing of British Madras On 22 September 1914, The SMS Emden, a German warship commanded by Captain Karl von Muller entered the waters off the coast of Madras, and bombed the facilities near the Madras harbour and slipped back into the ocean. The British were taken aback in this sudden attack. His family stated that Pillai coordinated the German attack with his personal presence in the SMS Emden, though this is not the official view. In any case, it is widely believed that Pillai and some Indian revolutionaries had a hand in the SMS Emden bombing of Madras. War activities The Indian Independence Committee ultimately became involved in the so-called Hindu-German Conspiracy along with the Ghadar Party in the United States. The German foreign office under Kaiser Wilhelm II funded the Committee's anti-British activities. Chempakaraman and A. Raman Pillai, both from Travancore and both students at German universities, worked together on the Committee. Pillai later allied with Indian National Congress chief Subhash Chandra Bose. Many of Pillai's letters to A. Raman Pillai, then a student in the University of Göttingen, were kept by Raman Pillai's son Rosscote Krishna Pillai. The letters reveal some aspects of Pillai's life in Germany between 1914 and 1920, as does one of July 1914, calling upon Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army to rise in revolt and fight against the British. After the end of World War I and Germany's defeat, Pillai stayed in Germany, working as a technician in a factory in Berlin; when Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose visited Vienna, Pillai met him and explained his plan of action. Foreign Minister of Provisional Government of India Chempakaraman statue in Chennai Pillai was the foreign minister of the Provisional Government of India set up in Kabul, Afghanistan on 1 December 1915, with Raja Mahendra Pratap as President and Maulana Barkatullah as Prime Minister. However, the defeat of the Germans in the war shattered the hopes of the revolutionaries, and the British forced them out of Afghanistan in 1919. During this time, the Germans were helping the Indian revolutionaries from their own motives. Though the Indians made it clear to the Germans that they were equal partners in their fight against the common enemy, the Germans wanted to use the revolutionaries' propaganda work and military intelligence for their own purposes. In 1907, Pillai coined the term \\"Jai Hind\\", which was adopted as a slogan of the Indian National Army in the 1940s at the suggestion of Abid Hasan. After India's independence, it emerged as a national slogan. Marriage and death In 1931, Pillai married Lakshmi Bai of Manipur, whom he had met in Berlin. Unfortunately they had a short life together, as Pillai soon fell ill. There were symptoms of slow poisoning and he went to Italy for treatment. He died in Berlin on 28 May 1934. Lakshmibai brought Pillai's ashes to India in 1935 where they were later ceremonially immersed in Kanyakumari with full state honours. It was Pillai's final wish that his ashes be sprinkled in Nanjilnadu (Kanyakumari), his family's native place.

Development The pistol operates with a recoil-operated, locked-breech and has a rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to lock and unlock itself from the slide, and the front part of the frame under the barrel is shaped as an accessory rail to accept laser sights or flash lights. A unique feature of this pistol is the detachable steel frame that sits inside the polymer grip and contains the fire control group. Like many modern military pistols, the QSZ-92 has a double-action/single-action trigger with a combined safety/decocker. Its dual stack magazine holds fifteen of either 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition (QSZ-92-9) or twenty proprietary 5.8×21mm Chinese-made armor-piercing rounds with bottle-necked case and pointed bullets (QSZ-92-5.8), closely resembling the Belgian 5.7×28mm format. Unlike most pistol magazines which narrow at the top for a consistent feed angle, the QSZ-92 has true double column feed in the same manner as many rifle magazines. The development of the QSZ-92 pistol began circa 1994 and it is now being adopted by the People's Liberation Army forces. The export variants (9mm version) include the CF-98 (barrel life c. 8000 rds) and the NP-42 (barrel life c. 10,000 rds). The latter is the basic version without provisions for suppressor etc. Both have so far found commercial export in Canada. The star engraving on the pistol grip indicates the ammo type. 9×19mm Parabellum version has the star, while military 5.8×21mm version does not. Export variants, which are chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition, have the star engraving. Usage The QSZ-92 is in limited service in the People's Liberation Army since the late 1990s, notably in People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison. The Chinese military has adopted the 5.8mm version over the 9mm one. Variants *QSZ-92: basic variant, which chambers the bottlenecked 5.8x21mm DAP92 ammunition or 9×19mm Parabellum. Its R50 value is smaller than 5 cm, R100 value smaller than 11 cm.

She published an autobiography, Meaning a Life (1978), and a book of verse, Poems and Transpositions (1980). Early life Oppen was born in Kalispell, Montana, to Ora and Alice (Conklin) Colby. Her father was a postmaster and her mother was a singer. She was raised in the Pacific Northwest. In 1928 she met George Oppen, who had been born in New Rochelle, New York, on 24 April 1908, while both were students at Oregon State University. Although they were, respectively, suspended (George) and expelled (Mary) for staying out together overnight, they formed a serious commitment, eventually to be a lifetime bond. Together they travelled extensively, and this began the succession of friendships and contacts out of which the poetry and politics of George and Mary Oppen grew. Fifty years later, in her autobiography Meaning A Life (1978), Mary Oppen observed of these times: Poetry, activism, and World War II After their initial peripatetic years together, the Oppens took up residence in New York City in the late 1920s. There they joined a circle of artists and writers, among whom were the poets Charles Reznikoff and Louis Zukofsky. During the 1930s the Oppens involved themselves in leftist political movements. They joined the Communist Party USA in 1935 after the seventh World Congress of the Communist Parties called for intellectuals to join in a united front against fascism and war. After World War II, in which George Oppen was severely wounded at the Battle of the Bulge, the Oppens were persecuted by the U.S. government for their leftist activities during the Depression. Rather than testify against friends and associates, the Oppens decided in 1950 to flee to Mexico, and by the late 1950s they had found their way into a cirlce of U.S. citizens living in Mexico City. Return to the United States After a brief trip to the United States in 1958, to visit their daughter Linda at her university, the Oppens returned to New York in the early 1960s. Back in Brooklyn, George, who had started writing again towards the end of his time in Mexico, renewed old ties with his fellow Objectivists and also befriended many younger poets. The Oppens continued to move around, once driving an amphibious car from Miami to New York. In the later part of the 1960s, the Oppens took up residence in the San Francisco Bay area, where George Oppen's family largely lived. For a time, they summered at Deer Isle, Maine, where they entertained such East Coast writers as Theodore Enslin, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Michael Heller, and John Taggart. Later years In 1970 Mary Oppen resumed writing poems and continued painting and work in collage. By 1975 she was in the midst of the composition of her memoirs, eventually to published as Meaning a Life: An Autobiography by Black Sparrow Press in May 1978. In this work, Mary Oppen makes apparent how completely she and George shared the risks, adventures, and commitments of their itinerant and artistic life. This included their harrowing, life-changing trip to Israel in September 1975. They had been invited by the mayor of Jerusalem to be his guests at the Mishkenot Sha'ananim, a residence for distinguished artists, writers, and musicians from abroad that faced the walls of the Old City.The Obvious and the Hidden: \\"Some Thoughts About \\"Disasters\\" by Shirley Kaufman After their return from this trip, Mary noticed a decline in her husband’s health and a waning in his artistic authority. In 1977, she provided secretarial help so George could complete his final volume of poetry, Primitive. According to Rachel Blau DuPlessis, this \\"help\\" was atypical of their practice and was related to George's decline. During this time, George's final illness began to manifest itself with confusion, failing memory, and other losses. In 1980, the Montemora Foundation published her book Poems & Transpositions. George Oppen, died of pneumonia preceded by Alzheimer's Disease on July 7, 1984, aged 76. On December 3, 1987, his widow read from her autobiography at the San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery. Mary Oppen died on May 14, 1990, of ovarian cancer at Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital in Berkeley, California, aged 81. She had been living in Albany, California.Mary Oppen, Author, 81 New York Times, May 16, 1990. Accessed March 23, 2009 She was survived by a daughter, Linda. Artist, poet, writer, photographer Several of her works have been exhibited. Oppen was also a diligent photographer and hers is a record of a life shared among writers and artists only now achieving recognition. These photographs afford glimpses into the world which George and Mary Oppen inhabited—one which was not officially recorded by the arbiters of taste or by academics in a depoliticized postwar America. Prints, paintings and collages by Mary Oppen were included in the 19th National Exhibition of Prints at the Library of Congress in 1963.

Previously called the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO), it established in 1960 with a mission statement \\"To manage information for the Scottish Police Service, wider Criminal Justice Community and the public to assist in the prevention and detection of crime and enhance public safety.\\" The organisation is based at Pacific Quay in Glasgow, under current Director John McLean. The high-profile Shirley McKie case has embroiled the SCRO in controversy surrounding its provision of fingerprint identification and verification services. This controversy lead to the separation in 2001 of these services from local control by each of the eight Scottish police forces (Central Scotland Police; Dumfries & Galloway Constabulary; Fife Constabulary; Grampian Police; Lothian & Borders Police; Northern Constabulary; Strathclyde Police; and, Tayside Police) and to the establishment of the Scottish Fingerprint Service. Fingerprint controversy In January 1997 an expert from the SCRO identified the left thumb print of DC Shirley McKie, a murder squad detective with Strathclyde Police, as coming from the bathroom door frame inside the house in Kilmarnock of murder victim, Marion Ross. Three other SCRO experts confirmed this thumb print identification but another five SCRO experts, who were asked to do so, refused. Nonetheless DC McKie, who denied ever having been inside the house, was charged with perjury. In May 1999 the Scottish High Court of Justiciary rejected the SCRO fingerprint evidence, and Shirley McKie was unanimously found not guilty of perjury. HM Inspectors of Constabulary investigated and reported that - despite SCRO's claims - McKie's prints were never at the scene of the murder. In June 2000 the then Justice Minister, Jim Wallace, and Lord Advocate, Lord Boyd, apologised in the Scottish parliament to Shirley McKie. A former Deputy Chief Constable of Tayside Police, James Mackay QPM, and Tayside's head of CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Scott Robertson, were then appointed by the Crown Office to conduct a further investigation into the issues relating to fingerprint evidence and to report back with their findings. Mackay's interim report on August 3, 2000 suggested that SCRO fingerprint personnel had given evidence in court that was: :\\"so significantly distorted that without further explanation, the SCRO identification likely amounts to collective manipulation and collective collusion.\\" According to a Scottish Executive Justice Department internal email written by senior official, Sheena Maclaren: :\\"Mr W Rae, then president of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and chairman of SCRO's executive committee, decided that given all the circumstances, all Chief Constables concluded that there was no alternative but to 'precautionary suspend' the four SCRO personnel. This was done on August 3 by the Director of SCRO.\\" Government ministers were informed of the decision to suspend the four fingerprint experts who had wrongly identified a thumb print as PC Shirley McKie's. Marked 'confidential', the final Mackay and Robertson report was submitted to the Crown Office in October 2000. It took more than five years for details of this report to emerge, but The Scotsman newspaper published extracts from it in February 2006. The report concluded that there was criminal conduct by SCRO employees and that there was sufficient evidence to justify criminal charges. However, the Crown Office told Mackay in September 2001 that no action was to be taken against the SCRO experts. As a result, they were reinstated and employed in the newly created Scottish Fingerprint Service. During a civil action in February 2003, brought by Shirley McKie against Stathclyde Police for malicious prosecution, the Lord Advocate Lord Boyd argued that expert witnesses should always be immune from prosecution - even if they gave false evidence.

The ride is based on the work of the character Gadget Hackwrench from the Disney animated series Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers at Tokyo Disneyland and formerly at Disneyland. Gadget is depicted on top of a small weather-vane on a building towards Chip and Dale's Tree House, as well as on a postage stamp in the attraction's loading area. Both versions of the attraction are located in Mickey's Toontown, and the Disneyland version opened January 24, 1993 along with the rest of Mickey's Toontown. The Tokyo Disneyland version opened on April 15, 1996. It was the only remaining Disneyland ride to be based on a Disney Afternoon television series. The ride debuted three years after the cartoon show was canceled. At 0:44 seconds, it is the shortest attraction in Disneyland. Ride Track layout Disneyland Version When riders walk up to the front entrance, they see the sign. The ride is primarily for children and therefore has very small cars. While two children can easily fit into a single car, most adults would have to travel alone (or with a small child). Guests board a train modeled after a homemade plane. Once on board, guests hear a safety spiel by Gadget (voiced by Tress MacNeille). Guests travel through Gadget's salvaged old comb, soup can and thread spool, and over Toon Lake. Near the end of the ride (the fastest turn), cartoon frogs squirt water above guests' heads. The coaster comes to a stop and pulls into the station. The riders then return to Toontown.

Over the past 40 years, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation has responded to the wishes of its donors, the concerns of its members, and the community's needs by issuing grants totaling close to $200 million. In addition to grants, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation has the flexibility to launch community initiatives without politics or other entanglements. Alarmed, for instance, at the rapid rise in new AIDS cases in Baton Rouge in 2002, The Foundation convened key stakeholders who formed the group Baton Rouge Citizens Against HIV and launched an awareness campaign known as Protect Yourself Baton Rouge. Since then, local testing has increased and the number of new reported cases has fallen. History In 1964, a group of 12 Baton Rouge business leaders created the Foundation to raise money and purchase land for the Gulf South Research Institute (GSRI) to locate offices in Baton Rouge. Since then, the nonprofit Foundation has pursued its work in two ways, connecting philanthropists to nonprofits across South Louisiana and some other parts of the world and taking on civic leadership projects, such as health and school reform, reviving downtown Baton Rouge and creating The Water Institute of the Gulf. In assets, BRAF is now ranked among the top 30 community foundations in the country in an annual survey by the Columbus Foundation. Highlights of the Foundation's work include: * 1964 acquisition of property for Gulf South Research Institute (GSRI) * Initiated The Community Fund for the Arts Campaign, which is currently managed by The Arts Council of Greater Baton Rouge * 1988 - a $700,000 investment to support Pennington Biomedical Research Institute and its new director, Dr. George Bray * Worked with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) to seed the beginning of Community Development Corporation in Baton Rouge * Created the Academic Distinction Fund. * Funded and consistently supported the Citizen's Task Force on Education, which spearheaded the conclusion of the East Baton Rouge Parish Desegregation Case * Coordinated the process that lead to Baton Rouge being awarded $18.6 million Hope VI Grant to revitalize the area between downtown Baton Rouge and LSU * Actively initiated and funded Plan Baton Rouge, Forum 35, Main Street Market, and BREADA * Spearheaded the creation of the Shaw Center for the Arts * Initiated HIV/AIDS Awareness Campaign to educate local citizens on the alarming rate of new HIV/AIDS cases * Created the Water Institute of the Gulf.Wold, Amy. , \\"The Advocate\\", 31 May 2013. TWIG is created to provide independent science for taking on the double threat of rising waters and subsiding lands in deltas around the world. * Created New Schools for Baton Rouge. Responding to Hurricane Katrina The Foundation's grant making teams performed hundreds of assessments, identified pressing needs for displaced residents, and issued over $600,000 in emergency grants to aid organizations and shelters within 10 days of the storm. As the recovery process moved forward, The Foundation continued to help displaced residents in the areas of basic human needs, physical and mental health, education, and employment. Further, The Foundation played a key role in the planning process of re-envisioning the state of Louisiana and connecting south Louisiana in more productive ways for all. =InCourage= Late in 2006, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation launched a mental health initiative in order to offer free and confidential counseling to the citizens impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The program is specifically and exclusively designed for people suffering from the after-effects of disaster. Developed by the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and adjusted to the unique population and culture of Louisiana, this program uses proven methods to help those affected cope. Baton Rouge CityStats A project launched by The Foundation in 2008 that uses indicators (statistics) to help measure the quality of life in East Baton Rouge. The goal of the project is to help created a shared vision among residents and to establish what is going well and what problem areas need to be addressed. The project uses a total of 50 quality-of-life indicators that measure categories such as economy, education, public safety, and health. CityStats is funded by the Foundation, its donors, and members.  Northshore Community Foundation  The Northshore Community Foundation was started in January 2007 with financial assistance from the Baton Rouge Area Foundation. The Northshore Community Foundation is run be an independent board of representing St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, LIvingston and St. Helena parishes.  Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana  The Foundation also has a partner in the western part of Louisiana, the Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana. BRAF provides financial support for the Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana, which is operated by an independent board. The Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana serves a total of five parishes - Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, and Jefferson Davis.  Ernest J.

The book award honors the accomplishments of Mr. Gaines, a Louisiana native and resident. Past winners include Attica Locke, Dinaw Mengestu, Victor LaValle, Ravi Howard, Stephanie Powell Watts, and Olympia Vernon.  New Schools for Baton Rouge  The Foundation and its donors created New Schools for Baton Rouge, a nonprofit that is recruiting and providing resources to charter schools. NSBR is working to improve failed schools that were taken over by the state of Louisiana. Structure The Baton Rouge Area Foundation is governed by directors who are appointed for three-year terms. Members may serve two consecutive terms after which they must rotate off for at least one year. The Board has fifteen at-large directors elected by the members. The immediate past Board Chair serves as a member of the Executive Committee and member of the Board, as does the Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation. Founding Chair John W. Barton Sr. has a permanent seat as Chair Emeritus on the Board and its Executive Committee. Members of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation provide the resources that drive the administrative activities and leadership programs they undertake on an annual basis. Without membership dues the staff could not continue to provide the support that they offer to both the nonprofit agencies and their donors. Mission The Baton Rouge Area Foundation unites human and financial resources to enhance the quality of life in South Louisiana. To achieve the mission, The Foundation: * Serves donors to build the assets that drive initiatives and solutions * Engages community leaders to develop appropriate responses to emerging opportunities and challenges * Partners with entities from its service area, as well as with other community foundations, in order to leverage collective resources and create the capacity to be a stimulus of positive regional change * Evaluates their work and shares the results with its stakeholders. Geographical Areas The Baton Rouge Area Foundation serves eight parishes that make up the Greater Baton Rouge Area * Ascension * East and West Baton Rouge * East and West Feliciana * Iberville * Livingston * Pointe Coupée Grant Areas * Arts and Humanities * Community Development * Education * Environment * Human Services * Medical/Health * Religion * Scholarships Funds Establishing a fund with The Foundation will allow donors to connect their philanthropic giving to the issues and nonprofits that interest them most. There are many different types of funds that can be established. There is also a tax deduction associated with a charitable donation. Types of Funds Donor Advised Fund A donor-advised fund is a charitable giving vehicle administered by the Foundation and created for the purpose of managing charitable donations on behalf of the donor. A donor-advised fund offers the opportunity to create an easy-to-establish, flexible vehicle for charitable giving as an alternative to direct giving or creating a private foundation. Field of Interest Fund A field of interest fund is a fund created to help a specific area, such as education, that the donor is interested in. Field of interest funds are managed by the Foundation and its board of directors. Unrestricted Fund Unrestricted funds, in the case of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation, help the Foundation to pay for emerging opportunities that benefit the community as a whole. The donor places no restrictions on how their donations are used and decisions are made by the board of directors. Unrestricted funds allow the Foundation to have flexibility in funding large projects such as the Shaw Center for the Arts. Scholarship Fund Scholarship funds are established to assist college students with grants that help cover the cost of tuition, room, and board. The Foundation assists the donor in the selection process creation that finds worthy students for the scholarships. Membership Members of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation support and shape the future of Baton Rouge and South Louisiana. It is through membership dollars that the Foundation is able to work on long-term, major projects and Civic Leadership Initiatives, such as the building of the Shaw Center for the Arts and the development of a master plan for the LSU Lakes.Lane, Emily. \\"Baton Rouge Area Foundation seeking firms to craft LSU lakes master plan\\", \\"NOLA.comThe Times-Picayune\\", Louisiana, 25 April 2014.

The parish primarily serves the Sunset District and neighboring Parkside, West Portal, St. Francis Wood, and Forest Hill. It is one of five parishes serving the Sunset District, along with Holy Name, St. Anne, St. Gabriel, and the smaller St. John of God. St. Cecilia Parish was established in 1917, with the first Masses held in a two-story house on Taraval Street. Mayor James Rolph donated to the parish an unused wooden school building, the former Parkside School, which became the first permanent church building, located at 15th and Taraval. The parish celebrated its Centennial on January 7, 2017, with additional events planned throughout the 2016–17 school year. The parish grew slowly under two pastors, but in 1946, Rev. Harold Collins was named pastor of St. Cecilia's, and under his leadership, the parish grew rapidly in the post-World War II years, necessitating the expansion of parish facilities. The new church, begun in 1954 and completed in 1956, is of a Spanish Colonial design and features a red-tile roof, a bell tower topped with a gold leaf cross, and a reinforced concrete structure. The neighboring school building, originally constructed in the 1930s, and doubled in size in 1948, is now home to approximately 600 students, down from the high of 800+ in the 1960s. The parish has a variety of programs serving its community, including outreach to the elderly and/or homebound, various activities serving its multi-ethnic parishioners, and volunteer groups that support the school, both financially and in terms of maintenance/upkeep. The community continues to grow and develop and continues to welcome newcomers at the same time that it loses many of its 50+ year members, thus re-affirming its vibrancy and relevance in the 21st century.

It was a broker of information on all aspects of the mining and processing of uranium, the nuclear fuel cycle, and the role of nuclear energy in helping to meet world electricity demand. The Centre was funded by companies involved in uranium exploration, mining and export in Australia.

He is a son of the founder of Professional Tajik Academic Music – Ziyodullo Shakhidi. Early life Tolib-khon Shakhidi began his musical career at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the Musical College in Dushanbe in 1965 from the Composition Class of Uri Ter-Osipov. In the same year, he entered the Moscow Tchaikovsky State Conservatory. During his student years in Moscow, he strove to be at the centre of musical activities. Conductors such as Mikhail Terion and Maxim Shostakovich performed his orchestral and instrumental compositions. In 1972 Tolib Shakhidi graduated from the Moscow Conservatory from the class of Aram Khachaturian. 'Tolib, your time is precious,' wrote the famous master on Shakhidi's graduation photograph – and since then, this has become the composer's fundamental belief both in life and in his creative work. Career From 1972 to this day, Tolib Shakhidi has participated in a number of music festivals and has striven to produce innovative and powerful compositions. His music attempts to create a synthesis between East and West. His brilliant understandings of orchestration and familiarity with different musical styles have firmly established him in the contemporary music scene. Working in a number of different genres, including theatre and cinema, Shakhidi's compositions often serve as the vehicle for the musical representation of intensely powerful plays. Drawing inspiration from playwrights such as Sophocles and Shakespeare, Shakhidi's compositions capture the listener's imagination much as a dramatic representation would. A master of different genres, including operas, ballets, symphonies and instrumental compositions, his work represents a unique fusion of the very best of the European and Asian musical traditions. He is a contemporary artist, whose world outlook transcends national boundaries. In this capacity, he regularly participates and has a great success in International festivals of Contemporary Music in Europe and U.S. (1987, 2001), in Japan, Baltic States, Central Asia, Iran and Turkey. The musical pieces of the composer have been performed by such orchestras as Philadelphia & Boston Symphony Orchestra, State Symphonic Orchestra of USSR, Orchestra of Valery Gergiev, Bolshoy Symphonic Orchestra of Russia n.a. Tchaikovsky, Orchestra of Cinematography conducted by Sergei Skripka, Saint Petersburg State Philharmonic Orchestra n.a Dmitri Shostakovich. Musicians such as cello performer Yo Yo Ma, violinist Sergey Kravtchenko and French saxophone player Pierre Stephane Meuge have performed the music of the master. He also has worked with conductors among which are Maxim Shostakovich, Dmitry Kitaenko, Charles Ansbacher, Mark Ermler, Sergey Skripka, Michael Terian, Dzhansug Kakhidze, Vladimir Kozhukhar, Valery Gergiev, Zakhid Khaknazarov, Eldar Azimov and Bijan Khadem-Missagh. \\"Taste, intellect, professionalism are the three main values of contemporary music\\" (). This aphorism, expressed by the composer fully complies with his own creative work. Tolib Shahidi represents a very rare type of Universal master-composer, who possesses the whole arsenal of contemporary musical language, yet uses the richest resources of traditional Eastern music of his region. This twin pillar is not an obstacle, but the most important source of his artistic power and originality. He won the 2008 Georges Delerue Award for his score of the film Two-Legged Horse.

They temporarily served as ministeriales of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, owners of Slovenj Gradec until the mid 14th century. One Conrad of Windischgracz (d. 1339) acted as a Habsburg administrator in the Habsburg Duchy of Styria from 1323 onwards. In 1574 the dynasty obtained Inkolat in Bohemia; later, however, several members converted to Lutheranism and lost their estates in the course of the Thirty Years' War. The Austrian diplomat Gottlieb of Windisch-Graetz (1630–1695) again converted to Roman Catholicism in 1682 and was elevated to the rank of Count of the Holy Roman Empire by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, in the same year. In 1693 his son Ernest Frederick (1670–1727) acquired Červená Lhota Castle in Southern Bohemia, which his descendant Joseph Nicholas of Windisch- Graetz (1744–1802) had to sell in 1755. Count Alfred Candidus Ferdinand zu Windisch-Graetz (1787–1862) was elevated to the rank of Fürst (Prince) in 1804. After the Holy Roman Empire was abolished two years later, their territories were mediatized to Württemberg and Austria. Alfred and his brother Weriand were both created Princes of the Austrian Empire in 1822, with Alfred and his successors being the first line of Princes of Windisch-Graetz (primogenitur), and Weriand and his successors being the second line (secundogenitur).Almanach de Gotha, 1910 edition, pp 245-248, Justus Perthes Great Britain's Princess Michael of Kent is descended from this family through her maternal grandmother, while her husband Prince Michael of Kent is a first cousin once removed of Archduchess Sophie Franziska of Austria, Princess of Windisch-Graetz.

Previously, he coached for a number of teams, most notably for the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins. Westhoff is considered to be among the greatest special teams coaches in league history.Ryan, p. 133 Coaching career=Miami Dolphins Westhoff was the special teams / tight ends coach for the Dolphins from 1986 - 2000. New York Jets Westhoff joined the Jets staff in 2001 after spending the previous 15 seasons in a similar capacity with the Miami Dolphins. He stepped down as the special teams coach for the New York Jets in December 2007 after the final game. On September 1, 2008, it was announced Westhoff would return to the Jets' sideline for the 2008 season in an undefined role. On August 8, 2010, Westhoff received a one-year contract extension. Westhoff remained with the team through 2011, which he announced would likely be his final year with the team. However, on January 26, 2012, the Jets announced that they had given Westhoff a contract extension through the 2012 season. Westhoff officially retired after the 2012 season. New Orleans Saints On November 15, 2017 the New Orleans Saints had hired Westhoff to join their special teams coaching staff for the remainder of the 2017 season.\\"Saints make a sudden coaching hire\\", 247Sports.com, November 15, 2017. The next day, Saints head coach Sean Payton said that Westhoff would be responsible for supervising all the special teams units.Herbie Teope, \\"Sean Payton on hiring of special teams guru Mike Westhoff: 'I felt like we needed help'\\", The Times-Picayune, November 16, 2017. Following the controversial loss in the 2018 NFC Championship Game versus the Los Angeles Rams, Westoff appeared on Mike's On radio show with Mike Francesa of WFAN. On the program, he declared the result of that game as \\"the toughest loss of his long career\\".Dennis Waszak Jr., Personal life In 1988, Westhoff was diagnosed with cancer of the femur in his left leg.Ryan, p. 134 Originally, the condition was misdiagnosed and Westhoff was nearly fatally wounded after the doctor accidentally cut one of his arteries. Once the correct diagnosis was made Westhoff underwent ten surgeries to remove the cancer and the bone replacing it with bone grafts, plates, screws and pins. A cracked bone graft in 2007, caused Westhoff to announce his departure from the Jets. In 2008, Westhoff entered the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to undergo a procedure to replace the missing femur with a titanium rod. After vigorous rehabilitation, Westhoff was able to walk again and returned to the Jets' sidelines in September 2008. Westhoff is a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Westhoff has a son, John.

Early career Clarke originally learned to play as a teenager with Eric Delaney, a jazz artist popular in England in the 1950s. By 1958 Clarke shifted to the flourishing rhythm and blues, and rock scene, joining Vince Eager's Beat Boys, composed of Tony Belcher (guitar), Alan Le Claire (born Alan Cocks, 26 August 1938; piano), and Tex Makins (born Anthony Paul Makins, 3 July 1940; bass), who performed at a London coffee bar. Vince Eager was born Roy Taylor (4 June 1940, Lincoln, Lincolnshire) and was a former member of The Harmonica Vagabonds, The Vagabonds Skiffle Group, Vince Eager and the Quiet Three. With guitarist Big Jim Sullivan (born James George Tomkins, 14 February 1941), The Beat Boys for a time became Marty Wilde's Wildcats, recording three tunes \\"High School Confidential\\", \\"Too Much\\" and \\"Mean Woman Blues\\". Subsequently, the same band again became The Beat Boys, backing up Billy Fury. Vince Taylor and the Playboys Bobbie Clarke (drums), Vince Taylor & unidentified bass player (Blokker, 1963) In about December 1958 Bobbie met 19-year-old Vince Taylor who was brought to the UK from America by his brother in law, Joe Barbera, who co-founded Hanna-Barbera. In September 1960, Clarke and his band became Taylor's Playboys with Kenny Pavell (guitar), Clive Powell (piano), and Tex Makins (bass). Powell later became notable as Georgie Fame. When Kenny Pavel left the band to play for Cliff Richard's Drifters, he was replaced for a while by 16-year-old Jimmy Page, future guitarist of Led Zeppelin. In 1958, their first records, \\"I Like Love\\" and \\"Right Behind You Baby\\" were released by Parlophone, with Tony Sheridan (Lead Guitar), Tony Harvey (Rhythm Guitar), Brian 'Liquorice' Locking (String Bass), Lou Brian (Piano) and Brian Bennett (Drums). In 1959 \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" was released. On 19 August 1960, Palette Records Ltd. released \\"I'll Be Your Hero\\" and the famous \\"Jet Black Machine\\" with Tony Harvey (Lead Guitar), Johnny Vance (Bass), Alan Le Claire (Piano) and Bobby Woodman (Drums). It stayed in the charts 9 weeks and reached the top 15. The single might have been a bigger hit, but UK teenagers of the time, under the influence of the media, were guided to listen to a more 'clean' sounding Cliff Richard and his band The Shadows.  The Bobby Woodman Noise  The Noise with Bob Steele on guitar was booked to play at the Olympia in Paris on 7–8 July 1961. The top of the bill was Wee Willie Harris. The other artists were Dave Sampson, Vince Eager, and Nero and the Gladiators, which contained lead guitar player Tony Harvey. Despite their differences, Vince was still friends with the band and asked, considering that he had never been to France, if he could come to Paris with his friends and if necessary, sing for free.  Reunion with Taylor  Vince dressed up for the occasion in his black leather gear and added a chain around his neck with a Joan of Arc medallion. He gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check that even the band was amazed, and the organizers decided to put Vince Taylor and his Playboys at the top of the Bill for both shows. As a result of Vince's exciting performance and his interaction with the band at those two shows Eddie Barclay signed the group to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label, with Bobbie Woodman changing his name to Bobbie Clarke. For the next two years, Bobbie Clarke with his band, once again called Vince Taylor and his Play Boys (Vince Taylor et ses Play Boys) toured Europe including The French Riviera, Brussels, Belgium, Spain, and The Netherlands in between recording several LP albums and numerous 45 RPM singles, at Barclay Studios in Paris, such as \\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\", \\"C’mon Everybody\\", \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"Long Tall Sally\\", \\"So Glad You’re Mine\\", \\"Baby Let's Play House\\", \\"Lovin Up A Storm\\" to name a few.  Johnny Hallyday's Golden Stars  In February 1963 Bobbie Clarke left Vince and became the drummer for Johnny Hallyday's Golden Stars, resulting in three EPs released that year: in November Bob Steele was replaced by American Joey Greco on lead guitar. Bobbie Clarke and Joey Greco with the Golden Stars also recorded the single \\"Memphis Tennessee\\" with Vince Taylor, that was released by Barclay under the title of \\"Vince Taylor and The New Play Boys\\". Johnny Hallyday joined the French army in June 1964.  Second reunion: Vince Taylor and the Bobbie Clarke Noise  In September 1964 the new Noise recorded the first \\"It's Not Unusual\\", a demo tape with Tom Jones. He re-formed The Noise, and with Vince Taylor played as the opening act for The Rolling Stones on their first three concerts in France, at the Olympia. Barclay released a \\"fake live\\" LP under the name \\"Vince Taylor with Bobbie Clark's Noise\\", simply titled \\"Vince..!\\", a single from the album with \\"My Babe\\" b/w \\"Trouble\\" and a 4 track EP with \\"My Babe\\", \\"Long Tall Sally\\" \\"Trouble\\" and \\"My Baby Left Me\\", all tracks from the LP. The album was re-released in 1972 without the fake audience, titled \\"Vince Is Alive, Well And Living In Paris\\". The Noise at that time were: Ralph Danks(guitar), Johnny Taylor (guitar), Bobbie Clarke (drums), \\"Stash\\" Prince Stanislas Kosslowski de Rola (percussion), and Alan Bugby (bass) who had just finished playing with Ralph Danks in the Gladiators, and with Johnny Taylor's Strangers (three EPs on the Vega label in 1962 to 1963). In mid 1965, with several bookings lined up, Vince Taylor went away suddenly and the band finally gave up and Johnny Taylor joined a religious movement. Ralph Danks left to play guitar with Three Dog Night, and later Tom Jones, Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. \\"Stash\\" Klossowski (a close friend of The Rolling Stones) would later produce The Dirty Strangers album featuring Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood. Career in the United States In late 1965, Clarke, \\"Prince Stash\\", and Ralph Danks moved to Hollywood where Bobbie replaced drummer Don Conka on several studio sessions with the original members of the band Love, consisting of Don Conka (drums), Bryan MacLean (rhythm guitar), Johnny Echols (lead guitar) and Ken Forssi (bass), with the addition of Vince Flaherty (vocals, harmonica). At the same time the band was recording with Vince Flaherty, they were also playing at a club called Bido Lito's with their leader Arthur Lee, but had not yet obtained a record deal of their own. Two recordings, \\"The Groove\\" and \\"Why\\", included Clarke as drummer, Daryl Dragon (\\"The Captain\\", of The Captain and Tennille, on the organ), and Charles Wright (on the rhythm guitar). An EP from the sessions was later released on the Verve label entitled \\"Vince and The Invincibles\\". In 1966 Bobbie Clarke also played with Frank Zappa, and cut a record with a band called \\"The Elves Themselves\\", augmented by members from Love and Jimi Hendrix. His career in the U.S. was cut short when he was arrested for cannabis possession, becoming the first UK rock musician to be deported from the United States.  Third reunion: Vince Taylor and the Bobbie Clarke Noise and Deep Purple  In 1967 Clarke returned to France and reformed \\"The Noise\\" with bass player Dave Curtis (ex lead singer of The Tremors), and guitarist Brian Griffiths, and once again gave it a go, with frontman Vince Taylor. In 1968 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore asked Clarke to join a new band called Roundabout (which later became known as Deep Purple). Bobbie brought with him Dave Curtis. Clarke and Curtis rehearsed in Deeves Hall for about 8 weeks with Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore and Nick Simper while singers were auditioned including Rod Evans who brought his Maze bandmate, drummer Ian Paice who was immediately auditioned (Clarke was out shopping) and selected. However, Deep Purple's managers, Tony Edwards and John Coletta backed Clarke to form a new band of their own with Steve Howe (later to join the band Yes) and singer/guitarist Clive Maldoon.  Bodast  This new band, named Bodast (after the first two letters of their three first names), was an evolution from the first incarnation of Deep Purple, and the ashes of Steve Howe's popular psychedelic band Tomorrow. They bridged the difficult period between the psychedelic pop of 1967 and the progressive/heavy rock of 1970. John Newey, for RPM, a division of Cherry Red Records, describes their music as: \\"…rich in past echoes of the Hollies, the Move and Tomorrow yet pointing the way ahead to the might of Queen and David Bowie.\\" Between May 1968 and mid 1969, Bodast produced an entire self-titled album for MGM Records. In February 1969, The Jeff Beck Group's drummer was fired and upon Beck's request Bobbie took his place, and did a few gigs at the Marquee in London, but was obligated to get back to work with Bodast, although Beck had expected him to stay with his group. Unfortunately for Bodast, their label MGM Records folded and the album was not released until 1981. The last gig for Bodast was in 1968 when they opened for The Who and were the backing band for Chuck Berry at the Royal Albert Hall. Thereafter, Clarke rejoined Johnny Hallyday in Paris.  The Bobbie Clarke Connection  In 1971–72 he formed The Bobbie Clarke Connection, consisting of: Eddie Ayers (vocals), Jack Moriarty (lead guitar), Tony Harvey (rhythm guitar), James Byrne (bass), Stash Klossowski (percussion) and Bobbie Clarke (drums). They rehearsed and cut demos at Barclay studios in Paris and narrowly missed being signed to the label. The Connection performed live on French TV and then toured Europe, crumbling during the tour in Spain.  Fourth reunion: Vince Taylor and the Bobbie Clarke Noise  In 1974, Bobbie's band The Noise again backed Vince Taylor, and Barclay re-released the original 45 singles \\"Ready Teddy\\" and \\"C’mon Everybody\\". In 1978 T and P Records released more of their old efforts under the name \\"Vince Taylor and his Play Boys\\" The Man Who Drummed The World  In October 1987, Black Leather Productions released an EP, recorded in May 1985, entitled Bobbie Clarke, The Man Who Drummed The World, Live in Paris featuring the songs \\"Memphis Tennessee\\", \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\".  Recent records and performances  In 2000, RPM Records UK, a division of Cherry Red Records, released a digitally remixed CD of the groundbreaking Bodast album (it is closer to the original 1969 mix by Keith West than previous reissues). On 10–11 May 2003, Clarke performed in Paris at a concert billed as \\"The Vince Taylor Memorial Concert with the Bobbie Clarke Noise\\". In 2004, P&C; Pin Up Disques, France, released a CD entitled Joey Greco – Bobbie Clarke – Joey and the Showmen – Live 2004.  Autobiography  In 2017, Camion Blanc released his autobiography Bobbie Clarke Playboy & Showman - Les memoires du batteur de Vince Taylor et Johnny Hallyday. This was translated from English into French by Romain Decoret from Clark's original diary entries.

Corcoran (August 10, 1859 – October 14, 1891) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. He was born in Brooklyn, New York. Corcoran debuted in the 1880 season, where he won 43 games and led the Chicago team to the National League championship. Cap Anson alternated him with pitcher Fred Goldsmith, giving Chicago the first true pitching \\"rotation\\" in professional baseball. In 1882, Corcoran became the first pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a career. Two seasons later, he became the first pitcher to throw three no- hitters, setting a record that would stand until 1965, when Sandy Koufax threw his fourth no-hitter. He is also famous for being one of baseball's very few switch-pitchers, and is one of only two players in MLB history whose batting- throwing combination was \\"bats left, throws both,\\" the other being Pat Venditte. A natural righty, Corcoran pitched four innings alternating throwing arms on June 16, 1884, due to the inflammation of his right index finger. He is credited with creating the first method of signaling pitches to his catcher, which consisted of moving a wad of chewing tobacco in his mouth to indicate what pitch would be thrown. Corcoran's arm was dead by 1885, and by 1887 he was out of the league. Corcoran, afflicted with Bright's disease, died in Newark, New Jersey at the age of 32. He was interred in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in East Orange. His brother, Mike, pitched in one major league game in 1884.

This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. Scripture While falling within the strict definition of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible has been treated and appreciated as literature; the King James Version in particular has long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made with the aim of emphasising its literary qualities. Christian devotional literature Devotionals are often used by Christians in order to help themselves grow closer in their relationship with God and learn how to put their faith into practice. Christian non-fiction Letters, theological treatises and other instructive and devotional works have been produced by Christian authors since the times of Jesus. For early Christian times almost all writing would be non- fiction, including letters, biblical commentaries, doctrinal works and hagiography. See Patristics. Since the invention of the printing press non- fictional literature has been used for the dissemination of the Christian message, and also for disseminating different viewpoints within Christianity. The tract (a small pamphlet containing an explanation of some point, or an appeal to the reader) was in use at the time of the Reformation and continues to be used as a part of proselytization. Christian allegory Allegory is a style of literature having the form of a story, but using symbolic figures, actions, or representations to express truths—Christian truths, in the case of Christian allegory. Beginning with the parables of Jesus, there has been a long tradition of Christian allegory, including Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, and Hannah Hurnard's Hinds' Feet on High Places. Christian fiction Christian fiction is sometimes harder to define than Christian non-fiction. Christian themes are not always explicit. Some Christian fiction, such as that of C. S. Lewis, draws on the allegorical writings of the past. There can also be argument as to whether the works of a Christian author are necessarily Christian fiction. For example, while there are undoubted Christian themes within J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings,Matthew T. Dickerson, Following Gandalf: Epic Battles and Moral Victory in The Lord of the Rings, Brazos Press, 2003, many might not consider this to be a work of Christian fiction. Other possible examples of Christian fiction include the works of G. K. Chesterton and George Macdonald. In the last few decades the existence of a Christian subculture, particularly in North America, has given rise to a specific genre of Christian novel, written by and for Christians of a particular type (i.e., conservative Evangelical Protestants), and generally with explicit Christian themes. Unlike the works of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, such novels are often marketed exclusively to Christians and sold in Christian bookshops. The Christy Awards honour excellence in this genre. In the late 20th century, with the rise of the Christian Right in American society, Christian-themed fiction has thrived. Examples include the works of Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins, Frank Peretti, Ted Dekker, Tosca Lee, Randy Alcorn, Francine Rivers, Wayne Thomas Batson, and Janette Oke. Within the field of Christian fiction smaller niche markets have emerged aimed at specific denominations, notably Catholic fiction and Latter Day Saints Fiction. There are also Christian fiction that is aimed at wider mainstream audiences, such as the best selling Left Behind series. Christian poetryChristian theatre Throughout the medieval period churches in Europe frequently performed mystery plays, retelling the stories of the Bible. These became widespread in Europe by the end of the fifteenth century. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries these developed into the Morality play, an allegorical play intended to exhort the audience to the virtuous life. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries theatre was generally seen as wicked, and the church made attempts to suppress it. In the twentieth century churches, particularly evangelical churches, rediscovered the use of theatre as a form of outreach and as a valid art form. Christianity & Literature (Journal) Christianity & Literature is a peer-reviewed literary periodical, published quarterly, on literature's encounters with Christian thought and history.

It was created as a satirical response to a challenge by anti-video game-violence activist and former attorney Jack Thompson. Background This game was created and released in response to \\"A Modest Video Game Proposal\\" issued in late 2005 by activist attorney Jack Thompson, known for his opposition to sex and violence in entertainment, including computer and video games. This challenge dared computer game producers to release a game following a \\"script\\" he outlined, in which the grieving father of a child killed by a computer gamer takes vengeance by murdering many people connected with the gaming industry in a brutal manner. Thompson promised to contribute a $10,000 donation to the charity of choice of Paul Eibeler (then-chairman of Take-Two Interactive, one of the game companies most heavily criticized by Thompson) if such a game were released. However, he has since claimed that the proposal was only a joke, and currently, no charity has been designated by Eibeler. The makers of the gaming-related webcomic Penny Arcade have, however, made a $10,000 donation in Thompson's name to the Entertainment Software Association Foundation, a philanthropic, grant-giving body run by the Entertainment Software Association. The \\"O.K\\" in the title refers to the initials of the protagonist, Osaki Kim, but together with the first part of the game's name is also a play on the accusation that video game violence is being considered normal by manufacturers and gamers. The reference to a \\"Murder Simulator\\" refers to what Thompson regularly proclaims all violent computer games to be. I'm O.K is a side-scrolling video game with 16-bit era low-resolution graphics that shares (to a degree) the basic gameplay (and somewhat lowbrow humor) of the Metal Slug series. The game also mentions one of Thompson's biggest cases—the Hot Coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. When the Konami Code is entered at the start-up screen followed by Enter, it shows a parody of the Hot Coffee mod. The title screen is a reference to the Mega Man 2 title screen. At the end of the game, the main character confronts the four designers of the game, which is a reference to Thompson's criterion of being able to kill the designers of a violent game.

It was invented by the German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1851, although an earlier model was developed in 1796 by Jesse Ramsden and Everard Home. A keratometer uses the relationship between object size (O), image size (I), the distance between the reflective surface and the object (d), and the radius of the reflective surface (R). If three of these variables are known (or fixed), the fourth can be calculated using the formula :R = 2d \\\\frac{I}{O} There are two distinct variants of determining R; Javal- Schiotz type keratometers have a fixed image size and are typically 'two position', whereas Bausch and Lomb type keratometers have a fixed object size and are usually 'one position'.  Javal-Schiotz Principles  The Javal- Schiotz keratometer is a two position instrument which uses a fixed image and doubling size and adjustable object size to determine the radius of curvature of the reflective surface. It uses two self illuminated mires (the object), one a red square, the other a green staircase design, which are held on a circumferential track in order to maintain a fixed distance from the eye. In order to get repeatable, accurate measurements, it is important that the instrument stays focused. It uses the Scheiner principle, common in autofocus devices, in which the converging reflected rays coming towards the eyepiece are viewed through (at least) two separate symmetrical apertures.  Bausch and Lomb principles The Bausch and Lomb Keratometer is a one position keratometer that gives readings in dioptric form. It differs from the Javal- Schiotz in that object size is fixed, image size is the manipulable variable. The reflected rays are passed through a Scheiner disc with 4 apertures – As there are two prisms, each aligned perpendicular to the other, the major and minor axis powers can be measured independently without adjusting the orientation of the instrument. In converting the measurements obtained from the corneal surface into a dioptric value, the B&L; keratometer uses the general lens formula (n’-n)/R and assumes an n’ of 1.3375 (compared to the actual corneal refractive index of n’=1.376). This is a fictional value, which includes an allowance for the small, yet significant, negative power of the posterior corneal surface. This allows for a readout in both refractive power (dioptres) and radius of curvature (millimeters).  References  * Gutmark R and Guyton DL.

As a member of the Education Committee, Heagney helped pass a bill that permanently bans anyone convicted of a serious felony from teaching in Connecticut and fought for expediting special education reimbursement for excess or unforeseen costs. In 2003, Heagney introduced legislation that requires the state's community-technical colleges, Connecticut State University System, and the University of Connecticut to allow members of the armed services that are called into active duty during the school year to take the classes they paid for without additional charges upon their return. The measure prevents reservists and full-time members of the armed services, who have already paid tuition costs to state colleges and universities, from losing the funds they have paid to those schools once they have been called to serve the country. In addition, Rob has voted for $500 million in tax relief for families and businesses, enhanced funding of the state’s open space acquisition program, and lead local opposition to the purchase of Village Water by the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company.

The river rises at Yüğlük Dağı in the Taurus mountains and flows through deep gorges to the southwest until it reaches the Mediterranean Sea at Limonlu (the ancient Antiochia Lamotis) in the district of Erdemli. About halfway along its course it is receives the Susama Deresi from the west as a tributary. In the town of Limonlu, about 500 metres west of the river mouth on a flat hill on the right bank is the Medieval castle . Below the castle a late Ottoman bridge crosses the river, probably on the site of an earlier Roman bridge. North of the town are the remains of an aqueduct, which carried water from the river west to the ancient towns of Elaiussa Sebaste and Corycus.  History  The ancient name of the river was Lamos (, Latinised as Lamus, Arabic: اللامس, al-Lāmis). The river formed the boundary between Rough Cilica (Kilikia Tracheia) to the west and Flat Cilicia (Kilikia Pedias) to the east. At its mouth was the city Antiochia Lamotis, earlier Lamos, formerly the capital of the surrounding region, the Lamotis.Alexander Polyhistor cited by Stephanus of Byzantium; Ptolemy 5.8.6; Strabo, Geography, 14.5.6-7) Later it formed the eastern edge of the Byzantine theme of Seleucia (Silifke), part of the border region of the empire known as the Kleisoura. Thus, the river formed part of the empire's border with the Islamic Caliphate. During the 9th–10th centuries, the river was the site of several Arab–Byzantine prisoner exchanges. The first of these exchanges occurred in 797 or 805 in the reign of the Caliph Harun ar-Rashid and the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus I.Cl. Huart: \\"Lamas-Ṣū,\\" The Encyclopaedia of Islam. New Edition. Vol. 5, Brill, Leiden, p. 647. Within twelve days, 3700 Arabic prisoners were released. The final prisoner exchange took place in 946 under Constantine VII and Al-Muti. 2482 Muslim men and women were released, 230 were kept in captivity. Later exchanges took place elsewhere, since it subsequently belonged to the Byzantines.

Astle began his cricket career as an opening batsman, representing New Zealand in the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, but over time playing first-class cricket for Canterbury he morphed into a bowling all-rounder. He made his Test cricket debut for New Zealand in 2012 in Sri Lanka, but did not play another international match until 2015. He has since represented New Zealand in all three forms of the game, but he hasn't been able to keep a consistent place in the team in any format because of regular injury problems and competition with other spin bowlers. In January 2020, Astle announced his retirement from first-class cricket to focus on limited-overs cricket. Early life and career Astle was born in Palmerston North in New Zealand in 1986, the son of first-class cricketer Alec Astle, who played three top-level cricket matches for Central Districts in the 1970s. Astle began his cricket career as an opening batsman, but over time morphed into an all-rounder with his leg spin bowling. Astle opened the batting for the New Zealand under-19s in the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup and did not bowl a ball. He finished the cup as the third-highest run-scorer, only behind future Test cricketers Cheteshwar Pujara from India and Eoin Morgan from Ireland. Astle made his debut for state side Cantebury in the first-class Plunket Shield in December 2005, and for the next four years played primarily as an opening batsman. Astle was an overseas professional for Aberdeenshire C.C. for the 2008 and 2009 seasons, starring with bat and ball. The club had a historic season in 2009, winning the SNCL Premier League and the Scottish Cup. Astle failed to make his mark for Canterbury as a batsman and wasn't able to stay in the team consistently. The turning point of his career came in March 2010. He wasn't even selected to play for Canterbury in a Plunket Shield match against Otago, but when Canterbury fast bowler Chris Martin was called up to the national team he had to leave the match after two days and Astle was brought into the team to replace him. In the final innings, Astle took his first five-wicket haul in a first-class match to help Canterbury win the match by 158 runs. In the following 2010–11 season, Astle took 37 wickets at an average of 29.08, both becoming Canterbury's best bowler and winning the championship. He followed this up with another strong season in 2011–12, taking a further 31 wickets. In October 2019, during the Plunket Shield match against Wellington, Astle became the first bowler for Canterbury to take 300 first-class wickets. In June 2020, he was offered a contract by Canterbury ahead of the 2020–21 domestic cricket season. International career=Test debut Astle was first included in the New Zealand national cricket team's squad in 2012 when he was named as New Zealand's second spinner for their tour of Sri Lanka in 2012. He made his Test debut for the Blackcaps against Sri Lanka on 25 November 2012. He scored 35 runs in the second innings in a key partnership with Ross Taylor of 107. He took his first wicket also in the second innings by removing Prasanna Jayawardene. Rather than this debut being the start of a long career for Astle, he didn't play another Test for years and was just one of a number of spinners to go through the New Zealand Test team during an injury to Daniel Vettori. Return to international cricket For the next three years, Astle did not return to New Zealand's national team in any form of the game. In 2015 he was selected to play for New Zealand A, and in a first-class match against Sri Lanka A took just the second ten-wicket haul of his first-class career. He took four wickets in the first innings and seven wickets in the second innings to finish with eleven for the match. This performance and a successful 2015–16 Ford Trophy put him back into the selection frame for the national team, and in January 2016 he was named in New Zealand's squad for a series of Twenty20 Internationals against Pakistan. He made his Twenty20 International debut on 15 January 2016, and played in the first two matches of the three-match series. He didn't take any wickets and conceded 41 runs from 4 overs across the two matches, so ahead of the final match he was released from the national squad and returned to playing for Canterbury. Astle became one of the best players in New Zealand's domestic cricket competitions, both in limited overs cricket and in the Plunket Shield, which gave him opportunities to play more international cricket matches for New Zealand. He returned to the national squad in the 2016–17 summer to replace the injured Mitchell Santner. He was the only specialist spin bowler named to play in a two-Test series against Pakistan. His selection received praise from Pakistan's coach, Mickey Arthur, who said that Astle was an \\"interesting choice\\" and an \\"attacking spinner\\". Astle played in the first Test of the series, the second of his career, but didn't score any runs and only bowled four overs. He was then included in New Zealand's squad for the 2016–17 Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, but he did not play a game in the series. Injury woes Aslte was part of a New Zealand A squad for a tour of India in 2017, and he was the team's best bowler. In a one-day match against India A, he took bowling figures of 4/22, which former Indian Test batsman Rahul Dravid called one of the best leg spin spells he'd seen in Indian conditions. In October 2017, Astle was named in New Zealand's One Day International (ODI) squad for their series against India, giving him a chance to make his ODI debut, but during a warm-up match against the Indian Presidents XI he tore his groin just three deliveries into his bowling spell. He was ruled out due to his injury and pulled from the squad. Astle returned home, and once fit again he played his 100th first-class match for Canterbury and was able to re-join the New Zealand ODI squad against the West Indies. He finally made his ODI debut for New Zealand on 20 December 2017. His first ODI series was a successful one: on debut he took 3 wickets for 33, using his wrong 'un well and rarely bowling a poor ball, then in the 2nd ODI he scored 49 runs as part of a 130-run partnership with Henry Nicholls, New Zealand's highest ever sixth-wicket partnership against the West Indies. In March 2018, he was named in New Zealand's Test squad for their series against England, replacing Mitchell Santner, who was ruled out due to injury, and in a day-night Test match in Auckland he took three wickets in the second innings, leading New Zealand to victory. Unfortunately he also suffered a side strain during the match, denying him the chance to play in the next Test match at his home ground Hagley Oval. Regardless, his form in both ODIs and Test matches was enough to give him a contract for the 2018–19 season with New Zealand Cricket, his first central contract after 12 years of first-class cricket. Astle was one of three spinners, along with Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi, named in New Zealand's squad for a series against Pakistan, and ahead of the series he played tour matches in the United Arab Emirates for New Zealand A to prepare and fight for a spot in the team. After he played well for New Zealand A he took a few days off to recover from kneecap irritation. He was initially only expected to miss the first ODI against Pakistan, but he was later ruled out of the tour altogether and forced to return home early. Astle recovered from his injury and returned to first-class cricket in New Zealand, where in February 2019, during the 2018–19 Plunket Shield season, he became the leading wicket- taker for Canterbury, going past Mark Priest's total of 290 dismissals. Astle returned to New Zealand's national team in February for their home ODI and Test series against Bangladesh. Because of his strong form and Ish Sodhi's struggles, he appeared to be New Zealand's favoured second spinner for the 2019 Cricket World Cup alongside Mitchell Santner, but when New Zealand announced their squad in April 2019 they selected Sodhi rather than Astle because Sodhi had more international experience. Following the World Cup, Astle was among four spin bowlers chosen to play for New Zealand in their Test series in Sri Lanka, where he'd made his Test debut seven years earlier.

Isaac carried on a friendly correspondence with Rabbeinu Tam, whom he was in the habit of consulting on doubtful questions, though not as a pupil consults a teacher. Abraham ben Nathan of Lunel and Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne were related to him, while the latter's son-in-law, Raavad, frequently consulted him on scientific questions. Sefer haIttur Isaac began his literary activity at the age of seventeen, when, at his father's suggestion, he wrote \\"Shechitah uTerefot,\\" rules for the slaughtering of animals and the eating of their flesh. At about the same time he wrote a small work on the precepts concerning tzitzit, at the request of Sheshet Benveniste \\"ha-Nasi\\" of Barcelona. Both works form a part of the legal codex \\"Ittur,\\" or \\"Ittur Soferim,\\" which occupied Isaac about twenty-three years (from 1170 to 1193). Until modern times only the first part of this work was known (Venice, 1608); the whole codex was published first by Schönblum (Lemberg, 1860), and included Isaac's \\"Aseret ha-Dibrot,\\" which is really only a special name for a part of the Ittur. The Ittur contains, in three parts, almost a complete code of laws, and is divided as follows: * Part 1: jurisprudence, including the laws of marriage and divorce; * Part 2: laws of shechitah and permissible meat, circumcision, tzitzit, tefillin, marriage ceremonies; * Part 3: \\"Aseret ha-Dibrot,\\" covering the laws of the following ten subjects: (1) Sukkot (2) lulav; (3) hallel; (4) shofar; (5) Yom Kippur; (6) megillah; (7) Hanukkah; (8) prohibition of chametz on Passover; (9) matzah and maror; (10) general laws for holidays. The book belongs to the classic productions of rabbinical literature in France. Isaac shows in this work a knowledge of the two Talmuds such as almost no other person of his time possessed. With works on the Geonim, among them many responsa and treatises which are otherwise unknown to-day, he shows the same familiarity as with the productions of the northern French Talmudists.

It represents a synthesis of two well known and extensively used network concepts: the \\"grid\\" and the \\"Radburn\\" pattern, derivatives of which are found in most city suburbs. Both concepts were self-conscious attempts to organize urban space for habitation. The grid was conceived and applied in the pre- automotive era of cities starting circa 2000 BC and prevailed until about 1900 AD. The Radburn pattern emerged in 1929 about thirty years following the invention of the internal combustion engine powered automobile and in anticipation of its eventual dominance as a means for mobility and transport. Both these patterns appear throughout North America. \\"Fused\\" refers to a systematic recombination of the essential characteristics of each of these two network patterns.Fanis Grammenos and Gordon Lovegrove, 2015.

No. 2, 163–176, June 2008 Terminology and history A diagram showing the street network structure of Radburn and its nested hierarchy. (The shaded area was not built) Modern urban planners generally classify street networks as either organic or planned. Planned networks tend to be organized according to geometric patterns, while the organic networks are believed to emerge from spontaneous, unorganized growth. Architectural historian Spiro Kostof writes that \\"The word 'grid' is a convenient, and imprecise, substitute for 'orthogonal planning'. 'Gridiron' in the US implies a pattern of long narrow blocks, and 'checkerboard' a pattern of square blocks.\\"Spiro Kostof, 1991: The City Shaped, Thames and Hudson Ltd., London In addition to the right angle being a key characteristic, a second attribute of equal importance is its imputed openness and unconstrained expandability. Loosely interpreted, the term \\"grid\\" can be applied to plans such as the Vitruvian octagonal plan for an ideal city, resembling a spider web, or to plans composed of concentric circles. These are all grids in that a regularly spaced armature leaves recurring openings and that they could, conceivably, expand outward. The emergence of the pure, rectilinear, orthogonal grid, or Hippodamian grid, is explained by the natural tendency of people to walk in a straight line, particularly in the absence of obstacles and on level land.Spiro Kostof. 1991. The City Shaped. Thames and Hudson Ltd. London, Ch X This intuitive explanation leaves the question of pre-grid and post grid non-rectilinear city patterns to be better understood, particularly those on plane territory such as Marrakech. Another potential influence may have been exerted by the second frequent user of city streets – horses. Horses also tend to move in a straight line, particularly at trotting, canter or galloping pace. When horses serve a city and draw chariots singly or in pairs, or, similarly, carts for a variety of transportation and processional functions, straight line travel becomes imperative; turns force a sluggish pace and cumbersome manoeuvres that reduce their efficiency of movement. The need for speed is accentuated by city size; distances to the public functions at the centre increase and, consequently, the need for quick access is intensified. Speed in turn implies straight lines. It is plausible that the drivers for rectilinear layouts may have been man's horses, mules, and carts as much as man himself, spurred by the growth of settlements. The creation of the Radburn pattern is attributed to Clarence Stein but has a lineage of ideas that preceded it in Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker's work that included the use of cul-de-sac and crescent street types. In contrast to the scarcity of records that obscures the original rationale for the grid, the reasons for the Radburn pattern have been articulated clearly in Stein's writings and those of his predecessors.Stein, C. (1957). Towards new towns for America. Cambridge, MA:MIT PressRaymond Unwin, Town Planning in Practice (London: Fisher Unwin, 1909) 393 \\"Radburn\\" (after a place in New Jersey) now denotes a street network configuration. It signifies a departure from the strict orthogonal geometry and regularity of the grid and a distinct approach to laying out new districts. As a system, it can be described more accurately as a \\"cellular\\" network that has a characteristic hierarchy of streets as distinct from identical streets intersecting at regular intervals. Its derivatives and idiosyncratic imitations are often characterized as \\"cul-de-sac and loop\\" patterns highlighting the distinguishing street types that are used systematically in this network. A second term equally uncharacteristic is \\"suburban\\". This association of a pattern with a location is inaccurate and unintentionally misleading: entire early cities such as Cairo and Fez are structured on this pattern whose newer suburbs follow the grid reversing the urban/suburban relationship. \\"Suburban\\" is also devoid of geometric descriptors of the pattern. These shorthand expressions conceal the variety of patterns that emerged in the 20th century that are decidedly neither grids nor \\"Radburn\\"Michael Southworth and Peter Owens, 1993: The evolving Metropolis: Studies of Community, Neighbourhood, and Street From at the Urban Edge, JAPA 59,3:271–288 and the \\"system\\" aspect of the pattern. The \\"loop and lollipop\\" label may be a more applicable descriptor of later interpretations of the Radburn model that appear to lack structure and to overlook key elements of the original concept such as its emphasis on pedestrian priority, for example. The pattern's systematic use of the cul-de- sac and loop is decidedly linked to automotive mobility as a means of controlling and guiding its flow. The Radburn pattern is a complex system; more than a series of identical orthogonal city blocks in a linear progression. It rests on a functional program plus an intentional picturesque aesthetic: it avoids straight lines, limits four-way intersections and shuns repetitive blocks all of which enhance its picturesque imagery.Frederick Howe, The Garden Cities of England, Scribner's Magazine, July 1912 To facilitate the discussion, the name \\"Radburn-like\\" or \\"Radburn-type\\" will be used in the subsequent sections. Criticisms of the prevailing network patterns One of several streets of the grid that was applied to the hilly site of Piraeus. A street in the Medina of Marrakech, showing the \\"wall\\" effect of agglutinated buildings and the absence of lower floor windows. The two dominant network patterns, the grid and Radburn, have been debated by planners, transportation engineers and social observers on grounds that include issues of defence, aesthetics, adaptability, sociability, mobility, health, safety, security and environmental impact. Defence, aesthetics, and adaptability The first known criticism of the grid was put forward on the grounds of defence that became irrelevant following the prevalence of the cannon (1500s). Aristotle argued that the old maze-like street pattern which preceded the grid, made it difficult for invading troops to find their way in and out of the city, Alberti also expressed the same view 1500 years later and added the advantage of a superior visual effect of the organic pattern over the grid.Southworth, M. & Ben-Joseph, E. (2003) Streets and the Shaping of Towns and Cities (Washington DC: Island Press) p23 A second criticism was put forward most forcefully by Camillo Sitte on aesthetic grounds. He argued that grids lack variety and, consequently, are uninteresting and can become oppressive by their monotony.Camillo Sitte, City Planning According to Artistic Principles, 1889 This argument has been undermined first by the potential variety of grid dimensions that can be used in combinations such as appear in many city plans. More importantly, ground observation of cities shows that the mix of buildings and their varied street alignments as well as open spaces with their size variations coupled with constant redevelopment, suppress the monotony of the grid. Nonetheless, 20th century planners shunned pure grids and implicitly endorsed C. Sitte's ideas on the need for a picturesque streetscape. This tendency is generally based on an intuitive aesthetic ground; that people dislike long open street vistas and prefer those that terminate.Duany, A. and E. Plater-Zyberk. \\"The Second Coming of the American Small Town\\", Wilson Quarterly, 16:1, 1992, 19–49. Recent subdivision or town layouts such as Poundbury(1993), Seaside(1984) and Kentlands(1995) consciously avoided the homogenous grid and its open vistas. A further criticism of the grid focuses on its unsuitability for uneven, variegated terrain. Its application in sites such as Priene (350 BC), Piraeus (circa 400 BC), San Francisco (1776), Saint John, NB (1631) and others severely limits general accessibility by inadvertently introducing steep slopes or, in certain cases, stepped road sections and creates construction difficulties. In cities with intemperate climates this limitation is accentuated. Moving in a straight line uphill becomes arduous or, occasionally, impossible, particularly for non-motorized wheeled means of transport. A Radburn-type network inherently includes a variety of city blocks and terminating vistas and, consequently, pre-empts criticism centered on monotony and lack of end-closure. Its unconstrained geometry adapts easily to topographical irregularities and geographical features such as streams, woodlots and natural ponds. As neither the alignment nor the length of neighbourhood streets need to remain constant, this model gives planners considerable latitude in laying out a network. Two newer aesthetic criticisms of the Radburn model emerged in the 1980s: the absence of a street \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\" and the repetitiveness of housing unit forms as found in suburban districts. Both these criticisms can be understood as a misapplication of aesthetic norms on socio-economic outcomes. The spaciousness of housing developments at the city's edge echoes the spaciousness of contemporary houses and are both driven not by aesthetic intent but by economic prosperity. Judging the visual outcome of prosperity using historic streetscape criteria of cities with a different socioeconomic makeup would make the verdict predictable and practically meaningless. Moreover, the \\"street wall\\" and \\"enclosure\\" criticism of the Radburn pattern applications are undermined by observation of city districts new and old. Close examination would reveal that these spatial qualities are inextricably linked to housing unit and population density as well as construction technology and are not necessarily the outcome of a street pattern: The higher the habitation density of the street (and town) the closer and taller the buildings have to be to accommodate more people. A street pattern does not induce either unit density or the visual wall effect. For example, in earlier cities with labyrinthine street layouts, analogous to some contemporary suburban districts, residential buildings were agglutinated creating an entire perimeter wall around the city block with few perforations for reasons of security, safety and a heightened sense of privacy, not streetscape aesthetic. Conversely, early founded cities in North America, where land was almost free but construction costly, are depicted with generous lot dimensions and very small houses on them (e.g. Salt Lake City) that created a weak \\"enclosure\\" vertically and horizontally. At both ends of the streetscape scale, very proximate and very sparse buildings, socio-economic factors drive the outcome. Surveyor's plan of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s – an example of a uniform square grid A straight street of a grid pattern in a 1950s suburb exhibiting low density, single family detached housing Regarding repetitiveness of housing form, ground observation shows no relation to street pattern. Homogeneity correlates better with methods of production. Early agglutinated housing forms as in Pompeii and Tunis, with vastly different street patterns, presented no face on the street by which design differences could be discerned; plain and luxurious houses had the same nondescript, blank street face. In recent times, older streets of more recent cities with a grid show considerable replication, based on vernacular and pattern books, as do newer streets on the fringe, based on industrialization. What has impacted the urban landscape appreciably is the scale of production: many single operators in earlier periods with small yearly output versus few large corporations by mid-20th century with high annual production volumes. Inevitably, the larger the operation is, the greater the economies of repetition are. Similar house models can be found not only in the same subdivision but across states and even nations. For example, veterans housing that was built in Canada consists of two or three models that were repeated in neighbourhoods and across the country. The most impressive effect of large- scale production is starkly visible in Levittown, New York (1947) and in social housing projects, where the State also aims at economies of scale. In the case of early Huguenot settlements, sameness of houses on identical grid patterns was pursued as a means of expressing the social equality of all inhabitants – a community goal.Kostof, S. (1991). The city shaped: Urban patterns and meanings through history. New York: Bulfinch Press Housing unit density Derivatives and variations of the Radburn street network pattern, collectively \\"the suburbs\\", have been criticized on the grounds of their relative low density. The low density criticism appears to be based on a historical coincidence mistaken for causality: most low density housing developments occurred in the 20th century at the periphery of existing cities after 1950 and intentionally incorporated cul-de-sac or looped streets (Radburn-inspired street types) regularly. By contrast, dense development occurred earlier (and continues) in city central areas most of which were laid on a grid pattern in the 19th century or earlier. This topological coincidence of pattern and density can be easily mistaken as a causal relationship. Radburn (1929), a suburb, was built at a density (19 persons per acre) higher than subsequent suburbs such as Kentlands (14 persons per acre) that were laid out on a grid-type pattern.Lee, C-M., & Ahn, K-H. (2003). \\"Is Kentlands better than Radburn? The American garden city and new urbanist paradigms.\\" Journal of the American Planning Association, 69 (1), 50–71. Also, many early grid-plan towns and suburbs such as Windermere, Florida, Dauphin, Manitoba, and St. Andrews, New Brunswick exhibit grid layouts and very low densities. Conversely, incidental cul-de-sac and crescent streets in central areas show high densities. Examples of unusual, unconventional associations of density and street type demonstrate that street patterns are coincidentally, not causally, related to housing density. Any given street pattern can be built at a predetermined density. Security Questions have been raised about the potential effect that the street patterns of a neighbourhood may play a role in the frequency that its homes are targets of theft and property damage. These questions were prompted by the apparent higher concentration of such events in certain neighbourhoods over the general average. This potential connection has been debated extensively. Factors such as sample size, analytical methods and the inclusion or omission of socio-demographic profiles of offenders, victims and neighbourhoods can confound the research outcomes. Yet some tentative correlations have been discerned. Experiments are rarely possible in existing neighbourhoods where the street pattern, the properties and the residents are given and inalterable. One such rare experiment, however, was tried in Five Oaks, Dayton, Ohio. A \\"troubled\\" neighbourhood's street pattern was converted from the regular grid to an interrupted grid resembling the Radburn pattern. The transformed layout was made discontinuous for cars but continuous for pedestrians through the use of connected cul-de- sacs. Following the change, the drop in antisocial incidents was substantial and immediate suggesting that the Radburn-like pattern contributed to it since all other factors remained practically unchanged.Oscar Newman, Creating Defensible Space,1990 Observational studies rest on cross-sectional statistical analysis of neighbourhoods to derive potential correlations between street patterns and the level of antisocial incidents. One such study An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once? Bill Hillier, Ozlem Sahbaz March 2008 Bartlett School of Graduate Studies University College London concluded that: #flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters; #density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level; #local movement is beneficial, larger scale movement not so; #relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. #As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The over-provision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. It also re-established that simple, linear cul-de-sac streets with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. Of the five concluding observations three are unrelated to network pattern, indicating the overriding role of socio-economic factors. The consensus among researchers is that streets patterns in themselves cannot be seen as crimino-genic. The genesis of crime rests elsewhere. Of the factors that assist the intent for crime, however, unconstrained permeability appears the most influential. The Radburn pattern restricts permeability while the uniform grid enables it. Transportation, traffic, and their effects More significant criticisms of the grid and the Radburn patterns were put forward based on the new urban transportation context of unprecedented levels of motorised mobility that raises issues of traffic congestion, collisions, accessibility, connectivity, legibility for pedestrian and driver, noise disturbance, car travel extent, air and water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of these criticisms rests on judging the functional adequacy of alternative networks regarding these aspects. Dysfunctional systems could entail heavy economic and social burdens that may be avoidable. Mobility and congestion The introduction of mechanized personal transport in large numbers during the 20th century tested every existing network's characteristics and their capacity to function satisfactorily for mobility and for city living in general. And since most cities where the motorcar first appeared had a grid layout,(e.g. New York, Chicago, and London) it was inevitably the first network pattern to experience its impact. The grid's emergence in a pedestrian world, in which wheeled traffic of horse-drawn carts was limited, along with its extensive replication, attest indirectly to its functional adequacy for pedestrian movement. The new question about its adequacy for serving motorized movement and for serving both prime modes, motorized and non-motorized in combination, continues to be debated. Early signs of a potential drawback of the orthogonal grid layout in serving wheeled traffic were discovered in Pompeii, Italy;http://www.pompeiana.org/Research/Streets_Research/AIA_2001/EEP_AIA2001_Text.htm at certain intersections left turns were prohibited and some streets or sections of others were decreed one-way. Contemporary traffic engineering recommends these measures to decrease congestion and improve flow in Centertown grids and have been applied extensively. It is worth noting that, the Pompeii restrictions occurred at horse and wagon speeds in the range of 5 to 10 km/hr, far below car speeds. Definitive proof of this deficiency, however, appeared 20 centuries later, when speeds and volumes of traffic reached critical thresholds and analysis of large numbers of data became computerized. However, a new complicating factor surfaced through adaptation. Operational methods to control the flow of traffic and avoid collisions were introduced and grew steadily in sophistication, from traffic signs to computer-controlled, time-orchestrated systems. While the necessity of these adaptations provides practical proof of the grid's inadequacy to serve motorized transport unaided, their introduction made theoretical proof harder. Highly advanced computer modeling of traffic flows overcame this difficulty. Another complicating factor in the early stages of motorization was the absence of a characteristic and typical alternative network pattern for a comparative analysis. Unlike the clear geometry of the grid, idiosyncratic, peculiar and site specific layouts, that have no obvious elements of a 'pattern' or 'stencil', cannot be accurately described and generalized. The only distinguishing element of current alternatives is their loose dendrite configuration, which is inherently hierarchical, that could be contrasted with the grid's inherent absence of hierarchy. Since in built districts neither of these networks appears in pure form, another level of complexity is introduced that tempers the certainty of analytical findings. Of two studies that have attempted the comparison between \\"Radburn-type\\" and \\"grid-type\\" networks, one is based on two hypothetical layouts for a specific site and the second on an existing district layout and two hypothetical overlays. The relationship of congestion to layout geometry and density have been tested using computer- based traffic modeling. The first study, reported in 1990Walter Kulash, Joe Anglin and David Marks (1990), \\"Traditional Neighborhood Development: Will the Traffic Work?\\" Development 21, July/August 1990, pp. 21–24; available at http://www.walkablestreets.com/kulash.htm compared the traffic performance in a 700-acre (2.8 km2) development that was laid out using two approaches, one with a hierarchical street layout that included cul-de-sac streets and the other a traditional grid. The study concluded that the non-hierarchical, traditional layout generally shows lower peak speeds and shorter, but more frequent intersection delays than the hierarchical pattern. The traditional pattern is not as friendly to the long trips as the hierarchical but friendlier to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout. A second extensive comparative traffic study IBI Group (June 2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, report prepared for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca of a subdivision about 830 acres (3.4 km2) tested three network models. It also tested the resilience of the layouts to an increased traffic load generated by higher residential densities. This study confirmed the previous findings that up to a density of 70 ppha (including jobs), which is above the average range of subdivision densities of 35 to 55 ppha, the grid layout had a marginally higher or equal delay per trip to the Radburn-type network. At a 90 ppha, the conventional pattern showed marginally higher delay per trip than the grid. This outcome suggests that within the normal range of residential subdivision densities the grid has a slight disadvantage, but under very dense conditions the slight advantage reverses in favour of the grid-type and that both may be subject to improvement. Traffic safety A traffic circle applied to a four-way intersection as a means of improving its safety. This device, with a proven record of collision reductions and traffic flow improvement, turns the cross- intersection into four virtual three-way intersections. The grid's traffic safety performance in comparison to other network types has been studied extensively and a general consensus is emerging both in theory and practice that, in general, it is the least safe of all currently used network patterns. A 1995 studyBen-Joseph, E. (1995). Livability and safety of suburban street patterns: A comparative study (Working Paper 642). Berkeley: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighbourhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included cul-de-sacs and crescents. The frequency of accidents was measurably higher in the grid neighbourhoods. Two subsequent studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one 2006 study,Lovegrove, G. & Sayed, T. (2006) Macro-level collision models for evaluating neighbourhood traffic safety, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 33, pp. 609–621 cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one. A second 2008 studySun, J. & Lovegrove, G. (2008). Research Study on Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, External Research Project for CMHC, Ottawa, Ontario found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns in the set. A 2009 study Eric Dumbaugh and Robert Rae. Safe Urban Form: Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety. Journal of the American Planning Association, Vol. 75, No. 3, Summer 2009 suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While land use matters, intersection types also affect traffic safety. Intersections in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes due to reductions in speed, but four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase total and injurious crashes significantly, all other things being equal. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable. Improved traffic safety has been shown to result from modifications to existing neighbourhoods laid out on a grid, indirectly suggesting its weakness with respect to safety. One study of the impacts of modificationsZein, S. R., Geddes, E., Hemsing, S., & Johnson, M. (1997). Safety benefits of traffic calming. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1578, 3–10 found that Area-wide urban traffic-calming schemes reduce the number of injury accidents by about 15 percent on average. The largest reduction of accidents is found for residential streets (about 25 percent); a somewhat smaller (about 10%) reduction is found for main roads. Vulnerable road users Following the introduction of motorized transport, pedestrians do not fare well in cities. Their space and freedom of movement has gradually been curtailed and the risk of injury increased. They are now seen and studied as Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) along with bicycle riders because of their overwhelming disadvantage in the case of a collision. Pedestrians experience stress and delay at every intersection, particularly when their mobility has been compromised either temporarily or through the aging process. A delay is unwelcome to pedestrians given that their slow speed and limited range of reach; the more frequent the intersections the higher the delay. Given the grid's origin as a network for pedestrian movement, it is important to understand how it serves pedestrians when it must synchronously serve vehicular traffic. A 2010 study concluded that of seven network patterns, including the Radburn-type pattern, the grid was the least safe for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicycles.Ms Vicky Feng Wei, BASc and Gord Lovegrove PhD (2011), Sustainable Road Safety: A New Neighbourhood Road Pattern that saves VRU Lives, University of British Columbia Legibility A 2X2 km square segment of the street network of Paris with an approximate scale bar. It shows the highly irregular city blocks and the range of street orientations, both common attributes of many historic cities Uniform grids with fixed cardinal directions can be mapped as easily on paper as on the mind. This quality — legibility — assists people in finding destinations and prevents the apprehension of being lost. However, this benefit is felt more by visitors to a district than by its residents. Many historic cities with labyrinthine plans, particularly in the medieval period and in the Islamic-Arab world, cause no anxiety to their permanent residents. (Some visitors, equipped with maps, see them as a delightful journey of discovery.) Many parts of Paris, France, for example, exhibit a highly irregular block dimensions and a wide range of street orientations not easily grasped by visitors. Residents quickly acquire many perceptual clues of direction and position without ever seeing printed maps of their domains and, in earlier times, without even the benefit of street signs. Legibility can be an advantage but it is not a necessary condition for a neighbourhood or a town to function well for its residents. While the uniform grid offers utmost legibility, mutated grids and other patterns can function adequately for finding directions. Walkability Walkability, a neologism, refers to those characteristics of an area which enable or hinder one's ability to walk around. More specifically, \\"walkable\\" means close; barrier-free; safe; full of pedestrian infrastructure and destinations; and upscale, leafy, or cosmopolitan.Ann Forsyth and Michael Southworth: Cities Afoot – Pedestrians, Walkability and Urban Design, Journal of Urban Design, Vol 13 #1 Of these characteristics some are related to the street network configuration, such as \\"close\\" and \\"pedestrian infrastructure\\" while others relate to land use and level of amenity such as destinations and sidewalks. The uniform grid's inherent high frequency and openness makes closeness easily achievable as the chosen routes can be direct. In its central city expression blocks are generally short and equipped with a sidewalk on each side. Suburban grids, however, often depart from the classic square block and include long orthogonal blocks and sidewalks only on one side or none at all. Similarly contemporary versions of the classic Radburn and Hampstead Garden Suburb do not always include pedestrian linkages that were present in the original. They too lack sidewalks, mostly to reduce costs but also on the assumption that resident traffic is low enough for the road pavement to be shared by all without risk. Published studies examined the relative connectivity of neighbourhoods built following the grid stencil or the Radburn-type pattern. A 1970 study compared Radburn to two other communities, one, Radburn-type (Reston, Virginia) and a second, a nearby unplanned community. It found that 47% of Radburn's residents shopped for groceries on foot, while comparable figures were 23% for Reston and only 8% for the second community. A 2003 study also compared Radburn (1929) to a neo-traditional development (1990). It found that the rates of connectivity differed with the destination. Shopping was considerably more direct and closer in Radburn while the elementary school was just as direct in both but at a marginally longer distance in Radburn. Accessibility to the park was virtually the same.Chang-Moo Lee and Kun-Hyuck Ahn : Is Kentlands Better than Radburn? APA Journal, Winter 2003, Vol. 69, No1 Overall, walkability was marginally better in the Radburn neighbourhood. A 2010 study, compared eight neighbourhoods of which four followed the grid network rules while the remainder adhered to the Radburn-type network structure. Connectivity, values ranged between 0.71 and 0.82, with the upper limit being 1.00. The grid-like set had two samples above the 0.76 average and one below, while the Radburn-type set had one above average and two below. The amount of walking did not correlate well with the connectivity values indicating that other factors were at play.Ray Tomalty and Murtaza Haider, 2010; Comparing Canadian New Urbanist and conventional Suburban Neighbourhoods, Canada Mortagage and Housing Corporation Walking correlated better when the additional pedestrian infrastructure, independent paths was included. These results confirmed previous findings that while connectivity, the essential characteristic of the grid, is a necessary condition for walkability it is not sufficient by itself to entice walking. A third study compared seven neighbourhoods by examining their walking and driving activity as an indicator or a network's propensity to entice walking. Using the agent- based modeling method it calculated the amount of walking under identical land use conditions. The traditional uniform grid, two Radburn-type patterns and one neo-traditional grid had lower levels of walking activity than a second version of the neo-traditional grid and the fused grid. Overall the Radburn- type networks had lower average walking scores and higher driving activity.Xiongbing Jin (2010) Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods. PhD thesis at Memorial University of Newfoundland These results show that the influence of the street network on walkability is clearly evident but also dependent on the specific characteristics of its geometry. Transit accommodation Although the grid was introduced long before any system of public transit would become necessary or available, its strict regularity provides sufficient flexibility for mapping transit routes. By contrast, derivatives of the Radburn-type network, particularly the non-cellular and strictly dendrite variety, are inflexible and force transit routes that are often long and circuitous resulting in an inefficient and costly service. Environmental issues Until the second half of the 20th century, the prime purpose of linking people to places has also been the prime criterion for judging a network's performance. New criteria surfaced when questions about the impact of development on the environment were raised. In that new context, a network's land consumption; its adaptability to the land's natural features; the degree of water impermeability it introduces; whether it lengthens trips and how it affects the production of greenhouse gases constitute part of a new set of criteria. Adaptability Typical, uniform grids are unresponsive to topography. Priene's plan, for example, is set on a hillside and most of its north-south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots, and loaded animals. Cities established more recently have utilized a similar approach to Priene's, for example: San Francisco, Vancouver, and Saint John, New Brunswick. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates. The strict orthogonal geometry forces roads and lots over creeks, marshes, and woodlots, thus disturbing the local ecology. It is said of the 1811 NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, the unconstrained geometry of the Radburn-type networks provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate natural features. Land consumption and conservation Depending on the choice of street pattern and the cross section of the street space, streets consume an average 26% of the total developed land.Arthur Gallion and Simon Eisner 1986 The Urban Pattern: City Planning and Design They can range from 20% to over 40%. For example, the Portland grid consumes 41% of the development land in street Right-of-Ways (ROW). At the low end of usage, Stein's Radburn neighbourhood uses about 24% of the total. Villages and towns with narrow streets (2 to 3 m wide) consume much less. Actual layouts of specific districts show variability within that range due to site-specific conditions and network pattern idiosyncrasies. Land taken up by streets becomes unavailable for development; its use is inefficient since it stays empty for most of the time. Were it to be developed, less land would be required for the same number housing units, resulting in lowering the pressure to consume more of it. A 2007 study IBI Group 2007 – Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts for mobility, infrastructure and emissions costs, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. compared alternative layout plans for a 3.4 square kilometre subdivision and found that the traditional grid layout had 43 percent more land dedicated to roads than the conventional Radburn-type network. Water cycle and water quality impacts All new development, irrespective of its network pattern, alters the pre-existing natural condition of a site and its ability to absorb and recycle rain water. Roads are a major factor in limiting absorption by the sheer amount of impermeable surfaces they introduce. They affect water usability by the generation of road surface pollutants that end up downstream making it unfit for direct use. The grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of impermeable surfaces in street pavement and sidewalks. In comparison to networks with discontinuous street types, that are characteristic of the Radburn pattern, grids can have up to 30% percent more impermeable surface attributable to roads. One study compared alternative layouts on a 155 ha (383 acre) site and found that the grid-type layout had 17% more impermeable surface area in total compared to the Radburn-type layout. Vehicle kilometres traveled and exhaust emissions Emissions from all transportation account for about 30% of the total from all sources and personal car use amounts to about 60% percent of that share that translates to about 18% percent of the total GHG production. Three factors that affect emissions from personal travel relate to network configuration and function: a) trip length b) speed of travel c) propensity for congestion. Studies have shown that Radburn-type networks could add up to 10 percent to the length of local, short trips. As was seen earlier under congestion, grid-type patterns induce longer trip times that are primarily due to stops at the characteristic and frequent four-way intersections. A 2007 study IBI Group (2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, report prepared for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca compared total traveled kilometres and total estimated emissions. Regarding the trip length, it confirmed previous studies by finding a 6% increase in local VKTs in the Radburn-type layout. The emissions comparison excluded CO2 and focused on three noxious (criteria) gases. Totalling the estimated cost of these emissions for ease of comparison, it found a 5% increase in costs for the conventional Radburn type layout. Development and lifecycle costs With the prevalence of motorized mobility, street infrastructure represents the single largest component of capital outlays for building a new neighbourhood. Until the end of the 19th century most city streets were unpaved, had no drainage sewers, few were lit, and hardly any had signage. Also, the majority were narrow by contemporary standards, frequently without sidewalks. Consequently, they consumed few resources for construction and maintenance. By contrast, current street design standards necessitate a large investment for construction and significant city budget allocations for their maintenance. A 2008 engineering study compared network patterns for the same district and found that the traditional, modified grid network (TND) pattern had about 46% higher costs for road infrastructure compared to the Radburn-type of the existing layout. These figures exclude the opportunity cost attributable to land that becomes unavailable for private use. The Radburn-type layout has approximately 30% less land dedicated to roads than the Neo-traditional layout. When accounting for this land and using a cost of $162,000 per hectare ($40,000/acre (2007 Dollars), land costs for roadways increase the relative cost for road infrastructure from a difference of 46% to 53% between the two layouts. The same study examined the lifecycle costs for the two network options and found that, similar to the capital costs, roads remain the key cost component of a community when accounting for on-going operations, maintenance and replacement costs. Summary of positive attributes In judging the two currently disputed network concepts it would appear that neither has all the requisite elements needed for adequately responding to the new urban transportation context of extensive motorized mobility. The Radburn pattern fares better overall since it was consciously designed \\"for the motor age\\". Similarly, the weaker overall performance of the grid can be understood as innate, given its origin in a predominantly pedestrian world. Advantages of a Radburn-like pattern: *less costly to construct and maintain *more flexible in adapting to the topography *greater ground permeability *lower trip delay *safer for cars and pedestrians, all other things equal *more picturesque all other things being equal *may provide a more sociable environment, particularly for children *may be more secure, all other factors being equal Advantages of a grid-like network: *reduces local distances due to its frequency of intersections *more walkable *accommodates transit easily *more legible, when it maintains the orthogonal directions *easy to lay out as city blocks and plots The need for an alternative An adaptation to the grid street network (closure) that prevents through car traffic while permitting full access to pedestrians and bicycles To function well, a contemporary network must include these advantages from the contrasting patterns thus reducing frictions and conflicts in urban environments. The need for an alternative has been evident since the middle of the 20th century for practical and theoretical considerations. In practice, in the second half of the 20th century citizens of many American and European cities have protested against the intrusion of through traffic in their neighbourhoods. Its side-effects were unwelcome as being detrimental to peace, tranquility, health, and safety. In response, cities introduced an armoury of controls to ensure that residential districts retained a high standard of life quality. Among these controls were one-way streets, closures, half-closures, traffic circles, and a liberal use of stop signs.R Ewing (1999) Traffic Calming: The State of Practice (ITE/FHWA) These measures being improvised retrofits implied the need for a network pattern in which techniques such as these would be obviated by innovative design. On the theoretical level, planners analysed the conflicts caused by the new urban mobility, proposed alternative schemes and, in some cases, applied them. Alexander proposed (1977) a genetic code of 10 \\"patterns\\" Alexander, C. et al. A Pattern Language. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977 which, when combined would resolve identified conflicts and would produce a convivial, gratifying district milieu. A central idea among them is a traffic impermeable neighbourhood area of about 10 ha, reminiscent of the Radburn plan principle but smaller in size. Doxiadis emphasized the importance of mobility and designed a large orthogonal grid (2 km by 2 km) of arterials to expedite circulation, as seen in Islamabad. He also recognized the need to separate \\"man from machine\\"Doxiadis, C. A (1975) Anthropopolis: City for Human Development (W. W. Norton & Co ) and introduced traffic-impermeable neighbourhoods also generally resembling the Radburn plan. The fused grid model District with four neighbourhoods and mixed use zone, showing the twin connectors Based on these sets of issues, the identified advantages of alternative patterns and the ideas of 20th century theorists, the fused grid assembles several elements from these precedents into a complete stencil. Just as the grid stencil and the Radburn pattern did, it sets up a geometric structure that exhibits the key characteristics of a functioning system. It consists of a large-scale open grid of collector streets, carrying moderate speed motorized traffic. This grid forms precincts (quadrants, neighbourhoods) that are normally about 16 ha (40 acres) in size (400 m by 400 m). Within each precinct, the layout uses crescents or cul-de-sacs or a combination of both to eliminate through traffic. In addition, a continuous open-space and pedestrian path system provides direct access to parks, public transit, retail, and community facilities. Residents can cross a quadrant block on foot in about five minutes. The most intensive land uses such as schools, community facilities, high-density residential uses, and retail are located in the center of the plan, reached by twinned roads which connect longer, district destination points. This synthesis of inherited network traditions and ideas is accomplished through the application of two practical means: a rectilinear, orthogonal geometry, a key characteristic of the grid, and the use of two street types that have generally been associated with the Radburn-type subdivisions. A diagram showing the nested hierarchy of roads in the fused grid transportation network The orthogonal geometry serves two purposes: a) to enhance the navigability of the network structure particularly at the district and regional scale. This is important at car speeds where decisions about destinations and turns have to be made promptly. b) to maintain a good level of safety at road intersections, as recommended by traffic engineering manuals. The grid's second essential characteristic, connectivity, is recaptured through a third element that completes the \\"system\\" – pedestrian- only connectors between regular streets that are intended for all movement modes. These connectors (paths) are typically routed through open spaces that occupy central points in a neighbourhood cell. Thus the neighbourhood street network comprises a mixture of streets; some pedestrian dominant and others car dominant. A fourth element is the nested hierarchy of streets that distinguishes between connectivity and permeability at the neighbourhood level. This idea reflects the fact the longer the linked destinations the higher the level of mobility must be. A dendrite configuration, such as a river, takes progressively wider expanses of land to accommodate the flow. A nested hierarchyMarshall, S. (2005) Streets And Patterns: The Structure of Urban Geometry (London and New York: Spon Press) Chapter 7 on the other hand distributes the flow at each volume level to alternative paths. The complete system, though it may appear unfamiliar, is composed of entirely familiar and extensively used elements in contemporary development. Proof of concept An approved Community Development Plan in Calgary, Alberta that is based on the fused grid model The model has been applied in two new communities, one in Stratford, ON and the other in Calgary, Alberta. The potential merits of the concept so far have been tested through research; site observations or measurements will await full build-out. The aspects of the model that have been tested correspond to the key criteria of performance, listed above, such as mobility, safety, cost, and environmental impact. Mobility A study on the transportation impacts of the fused grid IBI Group (2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca asserted through comparative analysis using computer-based traffic modeling that the fused grid produces the least total delay in all four density scenarios tested and performed progressively better as the density increased. Taking the fused grid as 100 (base), the delay was 32% more for the conventional Radburn-type pattern and 27% higher for the grid-type pattern. At the next higher density level the difference between patterns increased and they were correspondingly 100 (fused grid), 152 (Radburn-type) and 126 (grid -type). Traffic modeling shows the potential of the fused grid to reduce time delay during peak hours and, therefore, congestion. Traffic safety In a fused grid, three-way intersections are more common than four-way, which have been shown by traffic studies to be less safe.Marks, H. (1957). Subdividing for traffic safety. Traffic Quarterly, 11(3), 308–325.Lovegrove, G. & Sayed, T. (2006) Macro-level collision models for evaluating neighbourhood traffic safety, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 33, pp. 609–621. One study found that for each probable collision in the fused grid there would be 2.55 collisions in a standard grid, 2.39 in a layout designed to Dutch \\"sustainable road safety\\" guidelines, 1.46 in a cul- de-sac layout and 0.88 in a 3-way Offset layout.Sun, J. & Lovegrove, G. (2009). Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Ottawa, Walkability An extensive study of neighbourhoods based on geo-coded trips to local destinations found that a fused grid type of layout increases home-base walking trips by 11.3% in comparison to the conventional grid and it is associated with a 25.9% increase in the odds that residents will meet the recommended physical activity levels. Its 10% increase in relative connectivity for pedestrians is associated with a 23% decrease in vehicle kilometres of local travel. Frank, L. & Hawkins, C. (2008) Assessing Travel and Environmental Impacts of Contrasting Levels of Vehicular and Pedestrian Connectivity: Assessing Aspects of the Fused Grid, Ottawa: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation A second study compared seven neighbourhoods of different street network layouts for the daily travel patterns including the amount of walking that occurred. It found that the fused grid had considerably more walking activity. The set of network patterns included two versions of the traditional grid, two versions of post-war suburbs, two versions of the Traditional Neighbourhood Development (i.e. modified grid) and the fused frid. The lowest amount of walking was found to happen in one of the post-war conventional subdivision. Setting this as the base (100) for the purpose of comparison, the two classic grids registered 11%, one conventional subdivision 109%, one TND neighbourhood 108%, the second TND 137% and the fused grid 143%.Xiongbing Jin (2010) Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods. PhD thesis at Memorial University of Newfoundland In terms of the total distance walked, the fused grid registered 23% larger distance than the lowest of the seven in the set which was also reflected in the lowest amount of local driving. The fused grid anticipates the location of convenience shopping and amenities at the periphery of the four-quadrant neighbourhood. In such a configuration any part of the neighbourhood is a five-minute walk to the periphery and a ten-minute walk across the entire neighbourhood. Closeness of destinations is inherent in the structure of the network. The same structure, based on 400 m intervals, coincides with current practices for transit route location. Consequently, the street network pattern, the anticipated land use distribution and the location of transit stops are all conducive to walking. Health outcomes Neighbourhood layouts may indirectly influence the health and wellbeing of residents through their effect on factors such as noise, air quality, and physical activity. Noise levels and duration of exposure correlate with traffic volume and speed. According to a traffic analysis studyIBI Group 2007 – Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts for mobility, infrastructure and emissions costs, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation neighbourhood streets in the fused grid layout exhibit the lowest traffic volumes when compared to alternative layouts. By inference, low volumes imply lower duration of exposure to noise. Frequent turns in the streets (see drawing of approved development plan) result in speed reduction which lowers noise intensity. As a consequence of low traffic volumes, its residential streets show low air pollution levels. The high walking levels registered by the fused grid layout, mentioned above, indicate the potential of increased physical activity. In addition to these three factors that may impact on resident's health – noise, air quality, and physical activity – a fourth one, proximity to natural open spaces, has emerged as a significant contributor. Previous studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of frequent contact with nature and some have investigated the probable mechanism of the effect via stress abating biochemical processes,.Catharine Ward et al. More green space is linked to less stress in deprived communities: Evidence from salivary cortisol patterns Landscape and Urban Planning, 105 (2012) 221–229Hartig, T., Evans, G. W., Jamner, L.

Green space as a buffer between negative life events and health. Social Science & Medicine,70(8), 1203–1210 More recently, links were established to specific biota (microorganisms) found in nature and their direct influence on building immune system strength.Hanski et al. Environmental biodiversity, human microbiota, and allergy are interrelated April 4, 2012 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1205624109 Freely available online through the PNAS open access option. From these studies it can be inferred that a neighbourhood layout based on the fused grid model may confer these health and well-being benefits to residents because it incorporates green open spaces as integral parts of its pedestrian circulation network. Inclusion of green spaces is possible in any layout as an option; in the fused grid it is a necessary component of its configuration. Site adaptability The virtual grid mesh that underlies the fused grid network structure is expressed at 400 m intervals, five times the size of the traditional city block (about 80 m). At this scale there is greater flexibility to adapt the network elements to the topography and to specific site boundary constraints that are common in property configurations. Within the 16 ha quadrant, the discontinuous character of the streets and the possible combination of cul-de- sac and loop types provide sufficient latitude to the site plan designer to lay out an adapted version of the fused grid. There are at least 15 variations of the quadrant design that can be moulded to fit specific conditions. The site adaptability of the model has been demonstrated in the two approved layout plans. Ground permeability One study A Plan for Rainy Days: Water Runoff and Site Planning, 2007. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation quantified the relative permeability of three alternative site plans for the same site. The analysis results show that the impermeable areas of the three layouts – assuming roads, building foot prints and sidewalks to be impervious surfaces – ranged from 34.7% of fused grid to 35.8% of the conventional suburban to 39% of the grid-like pattern. Streets were the single most influential factor in the amount of the water runoff. They account for an impermeable surface which is up to three times that of the building footprint. Of the total impermeable area in the three layouts the portion attributable to streets ranges from 48 to 65 percent with the fused grid occupying the low end. The reduction in street length and the systematic use of open spaces as structural elements of the layout increase the potential of greater water permeability in the Fused Grid. Development and municipal costs A study compared the cost efficiency of three network patterns in improving the traffic performance of a district. It first established the cost of the network system of each before evaluating the efficiency ratio for the resulting traffic improvement.IBI Group 2008. Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts: mobility, infrastructure and emission costs. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation The analysis showed that the most significant capital cost of development is for roads. The conventional layout has the lowest capital costs for roads followed by the fused grid at 12% higher and the Neo-traditional (grid) layout at 46% higher. When considering the opportunity cost for land dedicated to right-of-ways (ROW), the fused grid allocated 9% more land to roads than the conventional grid, while the neo- traditional grid allocated 43% more. Similar to capital costs, roads remain the key cost component of community development after accounting for on-going operations, maintenance, and replacement costs. The study showed that there are significant differences in costs related to travel delay for the total road network particularly at the desirable transit-supportive densities. The delay costs incurred by the conventional layout are 12% higher than the fused grid followed by the Neotraditional grid at 3% higher. The conventional layout is less cost-efficient than the fused grid network since they have similar infrastructure costs but the latter delivers significant savings in travel time costs. The travel time benefits of the neo-traditional grid layout are disproportional to the required infrastructure investment. The obvious benefits of saving time for pedestrians and the enticement of more walking have not so far been monetized. Applications of the fused grid Retroactive application of the fused grid model can be seen in the centres of old European cities, such as Munich, Essen, and Freiburg and in newer railway towns or suburbs such as Vauban, Freiburg and Houten in the Netherlands. In most of these cases, acknowledging the constrains of an existing built environment, the key fused grid characteristic of a traffic impermeable centre is evident along with the primacy and continuity of pedestrian-only links to the remainder of the inherited street system. The fused grid is promoted in Canada by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. A similar debate has also been taking place in Europe and particularly the UK, where the term filtered permeabilityMELIA, S. , 2007. Eco Town Mobility.

A Confederate gun hit Mound Citys steam drum, causing an explosion which resulted in heavy casualties: 105 of the 175-man crew were killed. USS Mound City was then towed back to Memphis, Tennessee, and repaired. Battle Map of Saint Charles Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On the morning of June 17, 1862, USS Mound City, St. Louis, , , and transports, under the command of Commander Augustus Kilty, proceeded up White River towards St. Charles, Arkansas, attempting to resupply Major General Samuel R. Curtis's army near Jacksonport. The Confederate gunboat Maurepas was hopelessly outclassed by the Federal ironclads. She was deliberately sunk in the river channel along with two steamboats. Two rifled 32-pounder guns were placed on the bluff along with four field guns, Captain Dunnington commanded the 79 gunners. Captain Williams directed 35 sharpshooters. Captain Joseph Fry was in overall command. The Mound City and St. Louis carried 13 guns each while the Lexington and Conestoga each mounted seven guns. In addition, the tug Tiger carried a 34-pound howitzer. There were three transports ferrying 1,000–1,500 soldiers under Colonel Graham N. Fitch. A few miles below Saint Charles, the 46th Indiana Infantry, under the command of Colonel Fitch, disembarked, formed a skirmish line, and proceeded upriver towards the Confederate batteries on Saint Charles' bluffs, under the command of Captain Joseph Fry of the Confederate States Navy. At the same time, the Union gunboats went upriver to engage the Confederate batteries; Mound City was hit and her steam drum exploded scalding most of the crew to death. More than 125 sailors from Mound City were killed, but the other ship was towed to safety. Col. Fitch halted the gunboat activities to prevent further loss and then undertook an attack on the Confederate batteries with his infantry. The 46th Indiana turned the Confederate flank which ended the firing from the batteries and left Saint Charles open to Union occupation. The Confederates spiked their cannons and retreated. Hindman admitted a loss of six killed, one wounded, and eight missing, including Fry wounded and taken prisoner. Hindman claimed that his force inflicted 200 casualties, including 180 scalded to death on the Mound City. Battlefield Preservation The site of the land portion of the battle is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Charles Battle Site, and the battle is memorialized by the St. Charles Battle Monument in downtown St. Charles. More than 82 percent of the battlefield is protected from development by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission.

It was used by the New York Giants for their first two home games in 1889. The park was opened in the spring of 1888, as the new home of the Jersey City minor league club Jersey City Skeeters. The Jersey City club disbanded in July 1890, but the park continued to be used by other local teams for several years. It was located on a block bounded by Oakland Avenue (northwest); Hoboken Avenue (southwest); Bonner (now Baldwin) Avenue (southeast); and Fleet Street (northeast). Newspaper accounts in 1888 reported that the grandstand was to be built along Hoboken to shade the fans from the sun. Given the orientation of the block, that suggests home plate to center field pointing roughly northeast. The papers also reported that the old stands from the unused west half of the first Polo Grounds were to be ferried across the river and reassembled at the new Oakland Park. After the city had evicted the Giants from the original Polo Grounds at 110th Street and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, the Giants were compelled to find temporary home fields until they could secure a more permanent location. They played their first two games on April 24 and April 25 against Boston, each team winning one at Oakland Park. Their next home game came on April 29, at the St. George Cricket Grounds in Staten Island. Their last game at St. George was on June 14. Their record at St. George was 17-6. After a lengthy road trip, on July 8 they finally debuted their new home field at 8th Avenue and 155th Street in Manhattan. They dubbed this field the new Polo Grounds. That general vicinity would be the Giants' home through the 1957 season. Despite the nomadic nature of their 1889 season, the Giants would win the National League championship, edging out Boston by one game, and then go on to defeat Brooklyn in the NL-AA World Series.

England was the first on-air meteorologist to alert his viewers of a possible tornado using a commercial Doppler weather radar. He is also known for contributing to the invention of the First Warning map graphic commonly used to show ongoing weather alerts without interrupting regular programming. Currently, Gary is the Vice President of Corporate Relations and Weather Development at Griffin Communications LLC, the parent company to KWTV-DT, although the company uses the same single-story building as the studio. Early life and career England was born in Seiling, Oklahoma to Hazel and Lesley England. He lived in Enid for a while but was mostly raised in the Seiling area. Like many meteorologists, a dramatic early experience with the weather shaped his interest. For England, one event stands out among the variety of memorable experience with western Oklahoma weather: the 1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes which wiped out much of nearby Woodward, killing over 100 people. He counts other weather, including tornadoes, blizzards, dust storms, flash floods, and wildfires, as piquing his interest in weather. After graduating from high school, England joined the U.S. Navy at age 17, where he first began to study weather seriously. He attended the University of Oklahoma and graduated in 1965 with a B.S. in mathematics and meteorology. England then spent four years as a consulting meteorologist and oceanographer with A.H. Glenn and Associates in New Orleans. Broadcasting career England's first broadcasting job was a short stint at KTOK, an Oklahoma City talk radio station. England began working at KWTV on October 16, 1972.Gary England Celebrates 40 Years on KWTV, TVSpy, October 16, 2012. A few months later, KWTV introduced the first radar system specifically designed for television and during a live cut-in by England on May 24, 1973 for a tornado warning in Canadian County. Channel 9 viewers saw the radar image of a damaging F4 tornado near Union City in Canadian County which resulted in extensive damage to that small town. The Union City tornado was also the first documented chase ever on a tornado. The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) out of Norman placed numerous storm chasers around it to capture the life cycle on film, which was also a first. An original video of England's live cut-in of the Union City tornado in 1973 is often still used today in Channel 9's promos of England and its severe weather coverage. England is recognized, along with the firm Enterprise Electronics Corporation, as initiating development of the first commercial Doppler weather radar. While the National Weather Service is the only one legally responsible for issuing warnings in the United States, England is credited with issuing the first televised Doppler weather radar bulletin for a tornado, in March 1982. There is a dispute by some sources, as there was an earlier radar bulletin issued by Gil Whitney of WHIO-TV in Dayton, Ohio during the April 3, 1974 Xenia Tornado. However, the radar used by WHIO during the Xenia Tornado was a conventional weather radar, not a Dopplerized radar. In 1990 he helped create First Warning, a state map which appeared in the corner of the television screen, with counties colored in to indicate storm watches and warnings. In 1991 England also helped create Storm Tracker, a computer program that provided the audience with the time of arrival of severe weather. First Warning And Storm Tracker are used nationwide. He also helped create I-News, a computer program, since discontinued, that allowed PC users to receive both severe weather and breaking news alerts on their computer. On July 23, 2013, KWTV announced that England would be leaving his position at KWTV to become Vice President for Corporate Relations and Weather Development for Griffin Communications, the parent company of KWTV-DT (both Griffin and KWTV are located in the same single-story building). England was to be succeeded by David Payne, and England's final day as KWTV head meteorologist would be August 30, 2013, with his last forecast given on August 28. England's retirement had been anticipated since Payne joined the station in January, although England had previously said he expected to leave in October 2014.Update: Gary England is out as News 9 Chief Meteorologist…\\", The Lost Ogle, July 23, 2013.Mel Bracht, \\"Gary England to sign off as KWTV-9 chief meteorologist on Aug. 30\\", The Oklahoman, July 24, 2013. Other work England had a cameo appearance (via KWTV's archives) during the opening scene and served as one of three 'weather announcers' in the 1996 movie Twister. He also served as a consultant for the film. After the May 3, 1999 tornado outbreak, he appeared in over fifty national and international weather specials. In 2007 England wrote and recorded part of the sound track for a weather oriented episode of the cable show Saving Grace. England has written several books on Oklahoma weather, including his 1996 autobiography, Weathering The Storm, in which he cited Harry Volkman as an influence on his career. A new biography of England by Bob Burke was published in December 2006 titled, \\"Friday Night in the Big Town\\". England rejects anthropogenic climate change and believes in cyclic change due to many factors. A KWTV promo was featured in a Daily Show piece regarding global warming on June 14, 2007. The piece starts with comments by global warming denier and Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe regarding The Weather Channel's chief meteorologist's statement that the American Meteorological Society (AMS) should not certify anyone who does not accept global warming. Inhofe argued that The Weather Channel needs global warming in order to scare viewers and boost ratings. The Daily Show followed up Inhofe's comments by playing the KWTV's \\"Calm During The Storm\\" promo where a family is running from a massive tornado, cowering in the basement, the family hears England's voice on the television and the mother says to her son (clutched in her hands) \\"It's OK baby, listen to Gary England, he's going to tell us what's going on\\" in which then host Jon Stewart mocks the scene with \\"Listen to Gary England— OR YOUR CHILDREN WILL DIE!\\" The Daily Show connects England and Inhofe as both being from Oklahoma. England is interviewed in an episode of Monster Quest entitled \\"Unidentified Flying Creatures\\" where he comments on tornado footage that captured a Rod flying through the sky. In the interview, he comments on the phenomena without going into any supposition regarding its cause. Pop culture England is a pop culture icon in Oklahoma City and has a cult like following. He originated his own homespun phrase which became local folklore: \\"jump back, throw me down, Loretta...it's Friday night in the big town!\\" England is aptly described as having a \\"folksy and off-beat sense of humor and a persona that's pure country\\".

The Independence Party was a fiscally conservative and socially moderate political party. She also served as Tom Golisano's Campaign Chairwoman in his 1994, 1998 and 2002 gubernatorial bids. In 2002, Golisano's bid for governor of New York was ranked as the most expensive race in the U.S. and Golisano being the leader in the most personally-funded U.S.campaigns. Golisano spent almost $85 million of his own money. She also served as a national delegate to the Reform Party and was fundamentally responsible for the Reform Party gaining recognition by the Federal Election Commission. She is widely recognized for being the most named person in election lawsuits in the United States. After leaving the state, she went on to serve in campaigns in numerous other states as a ballot access expert. Today she is still considered one the country's most informed ballot access experts. In 1994, she was the party's nominee for comptroller of New York State. In 1998, she was the running mate of B. Thomas Golisano for lieutenant governor. The Golisano/Oliver ticket finished third, behind the Republican ticket of Gov.

It was created in 1784 for James Dutton, who had earlier represented Gloucestershire in Parliament. He was the son of James Dutton (originally James Naper) by Anne Dutton, daughter of Sir Ralph Dutton, 1st Baronet (see Dutton baronets). His father had assumed the surname of Dutton in lieu of his patronymic on succeeding to the Dutton estates in 1743. The title became extinct upon the death of the eighth Baron in 1985. The Honourable Ralph Dutton, youngest son of the second Baron, was Member of Parliament for Hampshire South and Cirencester. The hereditary Earl of Sherbourne was Lord John Marbury (portrayed by Roger Rees) on the American TV series The West Wing. History of Sherborne The ancestral seat of the Dutton family was Sherborne, Gloucestershire. In 1883 the Dutton estate consisted of: 3rd Baron Sherborne, 15773 acres in Gloucestershire (including the townships of Bibury, Windrush, Standish and Sherborne) and 150 acres in Hampshire; the Hon. John Thomas Dutton of Hinton Ampner (brother), 5124 acres in Hampshire; the Hon. Ralph Heneage Dutton of Tisbury Manor (brother), 3470 acres in Hampshire and 1280 acres in Somerset [the Wootton Courtenay estate].Gloucestershire Archives The remaining estate of more than passed to the National Trust after the 7th Baron's death. In particular, Ralph Stawell Dutton, the 8th Baron, created the gardens at Hinton Ampner in Hampshire. Thomas Dutton, acquired the manor of Sherborne in 1551 from Sir Christopher Alleyn. In 1574 and again in 1592 Thomas Dutton entertained Queen Elizabeth I at Sherborne, each time for six days.

By John Burke, 1841 page 178 In 1743 Sir John Dutton, (2nd) Baronet of Sherborne, the last in the Dutton male line at Sherborne, died. The Sherborne estate devolved to his sister Anne's son, James Lenox Naper (1712–1776), who changed his surname to Dutton in order to inherit.Sir John Dutton, was childless, and the choice of an heir lay between Sir John's two nephews, the sons of his two sisters, who were respectively Mrs. Naper, of Loughcrew, in Ireland, and Lady Reade, of Shipton Court. Young Naper and young Reade were constantly with their uncle, and the old man was still undecided to which of them to bequeath his property, when one day he called them to his bedside, and asked them to tell him what books they were then studying at school. The Naper boy at once answered that he was studying the Latin Grammar, but the Reade boy casually replied that he “didn’t know, except that it was a Blue Book” – blue being the Tory colour and his uncle a rabid Whig. From that date Sir John announced that he intended to leave his property to the boy who knew what he was studying, and this he accordingly did.

A number of exchanges and transactions regarding mares and foals took place between them. After Sir John's death in 1743, the horse breeding connection with Godolphin was continued by Sir John's brother-in-law James Naper, and his son James Lenox Dutton.

He has been a member of the Riksdag (SD) for Jönköping County since 2010. He previously served as leader of the Sweden Democratic Youth from 2000 until 2005. Early life Jimmie Åkesson was born in Ivetofta in Skåne County, but grew up in Sölvesborg in Blekinge County. He was a member of the Moderate Youth League, the youth wing of the Moderate Party, but left the Moderates to join the old Sweden Democratic Youth Association (the youth wing of the Sweden Democrats) in 1995. That same year he also co-founded a local chapter of the Sweden Democratic Youth Association. In 1997, he was elected as a deputy member of the party board. The party's policies that he claims he was most attracted to at first were its view on the European Union, and its policy on immigration. Prior to working full-time in politics, Åkesson worked as a web designer at the company BMJ Aktiv, which he co-founded with, among others, Björn Söder, the former party secretary of the Sweden Democrats. He studied political science, law, economics, human geography and philosophy at Lund University. Political career In 1998, at the age of 19, Åkesson was elected to public office as a councilman in Sölvesborg Municipality. The same year, he also became deputy chairman of the newly established Sweden Democratic Youth (Sverigedemokratisk Ungdom), and later, from 2000 to 2005, was chairman of the organization. In 2005, he defeated party leader Mikael Jansson in a party election to become the party leader of the Sweden Democrats (SD). In the 2010 general election, the SD for the first time crossed the election threshold and entered the Riksdag, with 5.70% of the votes, gaining 20 seats. Åkesson, who was placed first on the party's national ballot, was elected as a Member of the Riksdag (MP) together with 19 of his fellow party members. In September 2014, Sveriges Radio (SR) reported that Åkesson had spent upwards of 500,000 kronor ($70,000) in 2014 alone on online betting. The sum is more than the politician would have earned all year, after tax, reported SR. The revelation caused an uproar, both among people who view Åkesson as unreliable and those who opposed SR's decision to publish the information. Among the latter were former Green Party Spokesperson Maria Wetterstrand and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt. Åkesson himself called SR's actions an attempt at character assassination. Following the 2014 election, Åkesson announced he would be on sick leave due to burnout. In early 2015, Åkesson was named Sweden's most important opinion leader for the calendar year 2014 by the Swedish magazine DSM in their annual rankings. On 27 March 2015, Åkesson publicly announced that he would return to his duties as party leader for the SD, albeit initially in a somewhat reduced role, on the SVT program Skavlan, as well as in an open letter on his Facebook page. On 9 September 2018, the SD got 17.6% of the votes (+4.7 pp), after the Social Democratic Party (28.4%, -2.6 pp) and the Moderate Party (19.8%, -3.5 pp). SD will have 62 of 349 seats in the next Riksdag. Personal life Åkesson was engaged to Louise Erixon, who is the mayor of Sölvesborg, and one of the first Sweden Democrats to hold a local mayorship. They have a son, Nils, born 12 December 2013. On 24 April 2020, Erixon announced on her Facebook page that the couple had separated some time previously.https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/jimmie-akesson-och-louise-erixon- separerar/  Books  * (2008): 20 röster om 20 år.

It was originally broadcast on Showtime on April 4, 1993. Plot Julia Jenz (Jill Schoelen) arrives at Dr. Schifrin's house for a routine baby-sitting gig. Soon after Dr. Schifrin and his wife leave, a mysterious man knocks on the door. The man tells Julia that his car is broken down and asks to come inside to use the phone. Julia refuses but agrees to call the auto club. The phone is dead. Afraid to divulge, Julia lies and says that she called the auto club. The auto club never arrives, so the man returns continuously to ask for help. Hoping he goes away, Julia continues to lie, but the conversations become increasingly sinister. Meanwhile, Julia vaguely notices things turning up out of place around the house. Soon, it becomes obvious that someone is moving in and out of the house. At this time Julia discovers the children have been abducted. The intruder eventually attacks her and she narrowly escapes. It is later revealed that the children Julia babysat were never found or heard from again. Five years later, Julia is an introverted college student still traumatized by the incident. To make matters worse, strange things happen from time to time in her apartment, and Julia believes that the intruder is once again stalking her. Jill Johnson (Carol Kane), now a counselor at the college Julia attends, offers to help with the trauma of the experience in the past and the current events taking place. Jill contacts John Clifford (Charles Durning) to come to Julia's aid and help figure out who is stalking her. For protection Jill helps Julia purchase a gun and teaches her how to use it. Julia begins noticing the stalker is entering her apartment while she's sleeping and decides to stay with Jill until she feels safe to return to her own home. Having been through a similar situation years before, Jill and a reluctant John investigate the incident from Julia's past and come to the conclusion the stalker may be a ventriloquist throwing his voice to make it seem like he was outside when speaking to Julia. While investigating, Jill and John receive news that Julia has shot herself in the head while at her apartment. Jill promises to find the stalker. John eventually tracks down the stalker at a club where the latter performs as a ventriloquist, just as John hypothesized, but the stalker escapes. John tracks down the stalker's home and there finds pictures of Julia in the hospital and Jill's apartment. Having returned to her apartment, Jill notices a carton of juice bearing the faces of the missing children Julia babysat. Frightened, Jill arms herself and the stalker begins to taunt her; he is seen in makeup that allows him to 'disappear' from sight against Jill's apartment walls. He attacks and in the struggle, Jill is shot. John shows up just in time to shoot and kill the stalker. Some time later, Jill is recuperating in the hospital where Julia is located and is wheeled to Julia's room to discover her out of her coma, having survived the head wound.

Brauerei Weihenstephan, located at the monastery site since at least 1040, is said to be the world's oldest continuously operating brewery. Monastery Saint Korbinian, whose arrival in Freising is dated at around 720, founded a church dedicated to Saint Stephen here. A dormitory for monks that originally adjoined the building disappears from records by the end of the eighth century. The monastery itself, dedicated at first to Saint Vitus, then later to Saints Stephen and Michael, was founded by Bishop Hitto von Freising between 811 and 835. From then until 1020 or 1021 it was a monastery of Augustinian canons before becoming a Benedictine abbey. The abbey was dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation of Bavaria and its property sold off. In 1810 the abbey church, which had been made into a parish church, was demolished.

History  The school was established in 1999 as Calgary Science School and moved to its current location, formerly the Calgary Board of Education's Clem Gardner Elementary School, in 2002. The school originally conducted placement testing to ensure average academic performance in students admitted to the school, but this is no longer the case. Students can enroll and be granted a spot in the school solely after being selected from the top of the wait list and paying annual enrichment fees, regardless of their academic performance or needs. In July 2012, the School was granted a 15-year charter from the Alberta Government. The school was renamed to the Connect Charter School effective January 1st, 2014.  Today  At the time of writing, there are 104 students each in grades 4-9. Wait lists are held for each grade in the event of students leaving or transferring away. Fourteen buses, owned and operated by Southland Bussing of Calgary service CCS, taking the majority of the kids to and from school every school day. The library at CCS as seen in 2007 Currently, CCS has over 50 staff members, including janitorial staff, technical staff, office attendants, and those in charge of publications.  Technology  CCS maintains a 1-to-1 student to computer ratio, and it finished the transition from a Windows to a Mac base in the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year. Due to an Emerging Technologies grant from Alberta Education, in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years, each student received their own Apple MacBook. Students continue to be provided an iPad or Macbook depending on their grade as part of their enrichment fees and the school's efforts to integrate technology into what it calls \\"inquiry-based learning\\". All CCS classrooms are equipped with SMART board technology, and every classroom has a NEC projector and a screen. Classes use SMART boards for creative math and science debates/discussions.  School events  *ConnectED Canada Conference: The Calgary Science School hosted the first and second ConnectED Canada conferences. The conference hosted 156 delegates in the first year and 277 registered delegates from across Canada May 24–26, 2013. *Innovate West: will be an annual conference held at the Connect Charter School, formerly the Calgary Science School, celebrating a network of forward thinking educators in western Canada. *Lasers got Talent: Groups of students or single students will audition with pieces of music they make, sing and dance to a song or just show off their talents. The best ones perform in front of the whole school. The latest show was on October 30, 2009 when Chase Hadden showed of his yoyo skills and Swish Goswami became MJ and performed on Smooth Criminal. *Laser Idol: Students use their stunning voices to sing just like in Canadian Idol, but the age requirement is between Grades 4 and 9, rather than between 16 and 28, just like on the show. Just like Laserband, the best singers are picked from the pack and put up on stage to perform for the school. *Peace Festival: Students enter the gym and circle to many different stations that have different meaning. Since CSS has many different races and religions within the walls, most of the stations represent just that. There are stations where you pinpoint on a world map where you're from, there is a station where you get your face painted, and one station in the 2006-2007 peace festival included fictional stories written by grade 8 students, that were designed to be realistic and show some of the problems street children in favelas in Brazil face every day. *Lego League: The Calgary Science School periodically participates in FIRST Lego League, as they have since the 2003 edition, Mission Mars. Students are invited to participate either at lunch times or in electives.  Courses  From its first creation in 1999, Science Alberta School enforced a compulsory course known as SAS Quest. When the school was renamed as Calgary Science School, the program became Quest. The objective of this course was to familiarize students with everyday problems in the world and how to solve them. This program was removed in the 2004 school year. For electives (options) there are many choices including: C02 Cars, Digital Film Making, Photography, 3-D Design and Modelling, Animation, Outdoor Pursuits, Game Design, First Aid, Dance and many others. Students in some classes have the option to do \\"Explorer Projects\\". They are able to pick any topic of their liking, and explore the question until answered. Students often have very wide ranges of subjects. Recently, the plant room was turned into a woodworking shop, and now for grades 6 through 9, there is an elective started by Mr. Scott Petronech called C02-powered Cars. Students carve and sand wooden cars, load them with C02 canisters, and race them. References *Stephen, Cindy, \\"School shares peace message\\", Calgary Herald, December 16, 2004. pg.

In the battle, the Spartans narrowly defeated the exiles, with both sides suffering appreciable casualties. After the battle, Pausanias arranged a settlement between the two parties which allowed the reunification of Athens and Piraeus, and the reestablishment of democratic government in Athens. Prelude In late 404 BC, a small force of Athenian exiles under the command of Thrasybulus entered Attica and seized the border strong point of Phyle. These exiles were seeking to dislodge the repressive oligarchic government of the Thirty Tyrants. In two battles, they defeated the forces of that government; after the second battle, the Thirty were deposed and replaced by a more moderate government, the Ten. These new rulers, although they ended the brutality that had marked the reign of the Thirty, were not ready to compromise with the exiles, who now held Piraeus, the port of Athens. Desultory skirmishing between the two sides continued during this stalemate, with the Athenian cavalry attacking foragers from Piraeus; meanwhile, the men in Piraeus began to make attacks on the walls of Athens.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.24-27 Accordingly, both the Thirty at Eleusis and the Ten at Athens sent emissaries to Sparta, requesting assistance against the men in Piraeus. At this point, Spartan internal politics took a vital role in determining the future of Athens. Upon the arrival of the envoys, Lysander, who supported an aggressive foreign policy, and who had installed the Thirty in power in the first place, set out to Eleusis, where he began raising an army. After he left, however, the king Pausanias, who wished to pursue a more defensive foreign policy, succeeded in winning the support of three of the five ephors. He was dispatched at the head of an army to resolve the situation.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.27-30 The battle Upon Pausanias's arrival in Attica, he ordered the men in Piraeus to disperse; when they refused to do so, he drew his men up to attack them, but did not actually engage them. The next day, however, a party of Athenian light troops attacked the Spartans while they were reconnoitering near Piraeus. Pausanias dispatched his cavalry and his youngest infantrymen to attack them, while he with the rest of the infantry followed in support. In pursuit, the Spartan cavalry and advance infantry entered Piraeus, where they encountered a large body of light troops, and were driven back with losses. Thrasybulus then came out with his hoplite force to press the issue; the Spartan hoplites engaged them, and, after a time, defeated them, inflicting 150 casualties. The men from Piraeus returned to the city, while Pausanias and his men returned to their camp. The war was over.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.27-34 Aftermath After winning this victory, Pausanias, instead of pressing his advantage, sought to effect a reconciliation between the two Athenian parties. Accordingly, he persuaded both the men from Piraeus and the government in Athens to send emissaries to Sparta. These returned along with 15 officials empowered to work with Pausanias to negotiate a settlement to the issue. Pausanias then persuaded the Athenians to settle their disagreement on the terms of all being permitted to return to their homes except for the Thirty and their most prominent collaborators, while all who feared for their safety were free to remove to Eleusis. Democracy was reestablished, and all but the most egregious offenders were pardoned. Eleusis remained independent for a time, but, when it was revealed that the Thirty were gathering a mercenary army there, a preventive strike was launched and the town was reabsorbed into the Athenian state.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.35-43 NotesReferences *Buck, Robert J., Thrasybulus and the Athenian Democracy: the life of an Athenian statesman.

Most notably, he created eight videos for LL Cool J, including \\"Mama Said Knock You Out\\", which won awards from both MTV and Billboard—and went on to be listed by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. In 2013, Complex Magazine ranked \\"Mama Said Knock You Out\\" as one of the top 50 rap videos of the 1990s, crediting it with creating \\"one of the most crucial links in establishing the cultural bridge between boxing and rap.\\" Barclay was often hired to direct videos for films, introducing audiences to House Party (1990), White Men Can't Jump (1992), Mo' Money (1992), Posse (1993), and Cool Runnings (1993), among others. In 2012, Barclay directed his first music video in 16 years, working once again with LL Cool J and R&B; star Joe on the video for \\"Take It\\". Also drawing on his music video experience was Barclay's episode (\\"The Coup\\") of the Steven Spielberg-produced NBC series Smash, in which TV Fanatic said that the Barclay-directed number for the original song \\"Touch Me\\" (written by OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder) \\"pushed the boundaries from traditional Broadway show to music video level.\\" Film and television career=1990s Paris began his successful career in television with an episode of Angel Street. He was hired by John Wells, who was making his debut as an executive producer. Barclay directed Shawn and Marlon Wayans' first feature film, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) – also featuring Keenen Ivory Wayans, Vivica Fox, and Bernie Mac. Although it received mixed reviews, it was a box office success and has built a cult following since its release. Barclay also directed the HBO movie, The Cherokee Kid (1996), a Western dramedy starring Sinbad, James Coburn, Burt Reynolds, Gregory Hines, and A Martinez. After directing episodes of ER, Paris directed and eventually became a producer of NYPD Blue. In three years there, Barclay would receive two Emmy Awards for best directing—the second of which was for the episode titled \\"Hearts and Souls\\"— featuring the death of Jimmy Smits' character Bobby Simone. The episode has been ranked one of TV Guides 100 Best Episodes of All Time. Barclay has since reteamed with Smits again in his role as \\"Nero Padilla\\" on Sons of Anarchy. 2000s In 2000, Barclay joined forces with fellow NYPD Blue producers Steven Bochco and Nicholas Wootton to create City of Angels, a medical drama with a predominantly African-American cast including Blair Underwood, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Maya Rudolph, and Vivica Fox. The show aired on CBS for two seasons while winning two NAACP awards. In 2002 he returned to the John Wells fold to produce and direct the pilot, The Big Time, featuring Christina Hendricks, Dylan Baker, Molly Ringwald and Christopher Lloyd—which eventually aired as a two-hour movie. In the years that followed, Barclay worked on a wide variety of television dramas and comedies. He served as co-executive producer and producing director of the series Cold Case, for which he has also directed nine episodes. Other shows he directed in the decade include The West Wing, Huff, Law & Order, Numb3rs, Lost, House, The Shield, Weeds, Monk,The Good Wife, NCIS: Los Angeles, Sons of Anarchy, CSI, The Mentalist and 9 episodes of Glee. 2008 marked Barclay's return to HBO, where he executive produced three seasons of In Treatment, as well as directed 36 episodes. 2010–present In 2011, Barclay became the executive producer and primary director for the fourth season of FX's Sons of Anarchy, a role he continued through the seventh and final season. Also in 2013, Barclay directed two episodes of Glee, \\"Diva\\" and \\"Lights Out\\". For his work on \\"Diva\\", Barclay was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Direction in a Comedy Series, his second Emmy nomination for Glee. In the same season, Barclay directed an episode of The New Normal and the penultimate episode of the ABC series Last Resort. In 2014, Barclay directed the season premiere and penultimate episodes of Sons of Anarchy for the fourth year running. In addition to his Sons of Anarchy duties, Barclay also directed the milestone episode \\"100\\" for Glee, for which he received another Emmy nomination, in addition to episodes of The Good Wife, Extant, executive produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Halle Berry, and Manhattan, a Tommy Schlamme/Sam Shaw period drama for WGN America; and Glee’s emotional flashback episode \\"2009\\" – the first half of the series finale, \\"a perfect tribute to the origins of Glee, the original cast, and Cory Monteith.\\" In 2015, Paris continued his role as Executive Producer/Director on FX's The Bastard Executioner. The show starred Katey Sagal, Stephen Moyer, and Matthew Rhys. At the end of the year, he was enlisted by FOX to direct an episode of Empire, the Television Critics Association program of the year. In 2016, Paris joined the Shondaland family by directing an episode of ABC's critically acclaimed show, Scandal, created/produced by Shonda Rhimes, starring Kerry Washington.

Paris is currently working as the executive producing director on the Shondaland project, Station 19, which follows a group of Seattle firefighters in a spinoff of the highly successful Grey's Anatomy. The show is currently airing its third season in Spring 2020 on ABC. In early 2019, Paris teamed up with the Human Rights Campaign and fellow award winning director, Dustin Lance Black to produce and direct a star-studded Americans for the Equality Act public awareness and advertising campaign. The series, which launched on March 25, 2019 with a debut video featuring Academy Award-winning actress Sally Field and her son Sam Greisman, features prominent figures in entertainment, sports and beyond speaking about the need for the Equality Act — a crucial civil rights bill that would extend clear, comprehensive non-discrimination protections to millions of LGBTQ people nationwide.https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-dustin-lance-black-paris-barclay- launch-americans-for-the-equality-act The powerhouse lineup of supportive film and television actors, influencers, musicians and professional athletes, includes Adam Rippon,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt- rights/olympic-skater-rippon-joins-call-for-u-s-lgbt-equality-law- idUSKCN1S5001 Shea Diamond,https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-video-of-transgender- singer-shea-diamond-in-equality-act-campaign Alexandra Billings, Blossom Brown, Justina Machado,https://www.hrc.org/videos/justina-machado-is-an- american-for-the-equality-act Gloria Calderon Kellett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jane Lynch, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Justin Mikita,https://www.hrc.org/videos/jesse-tyler-ferguson-and-justin-mikita-join- americans-for-the-equality-act Charlie and Max Carver, Karamo Brown,https://www.hrc.org/videos/karamo-brown-is-an-american-for-the-equality- act Marcia Gay Harden, and Nyle DiMarco.

After the vote, Barclay expressed gratitude for the honor and admiration for the Union's history, saying \\"I am profoundly honored to be elected President of the DGA.... The DGA has worked for more than three-quarters of a century to advance the creative and economic rights of directors and their teams and I look forward to continuing this strong tradition of service. As the son of a glass blower and a tile maker from Chicago, I am extremely humbled to have the honor to serve in the footsteps of the legendary leaders of the DGA like Frank Capra, Robert Wise and Gil Cates.\\" Barclay was nominated for the Presidency by past-President Michael Apted, who said of him, \\"Paris’ qualifications for DGA president are exceptional.... His understanding of the issues facing directors and their teams is outstanding and his ability to resolve problems and create solutions is beyond compare.\\" His nomination was seconded by Steven Soderbergh, who said of Barclay, \\"This is a great moment for our Guild; Paris will be a phenomenal leader as we move into the future.\\" Paris was enthusiastically re-elected in June 2015 to continue his notable presidency. Before being elected DGA President, Barclay served four terms as First Vice President of the DGA, where he was the first African-American Officer in the history of the guild. While serving as First Vice President, Paris was also chair of the DGA’s Political Action Committee, whose mission it is to promote the interests of DGA members to state and federal lawmakers. Their top issues include battling online copyright threats and promoting production tax incentives. He also served on the Western Directors Council and co-chaired the Diversity Task Force, whose mission is to encourage the hiring of women and minority directors to networks and studios. In addition, Paris served as a board member of the DGA-affiliated Franco-American Cultural Fund, which promotes cultural exchange between French and American directors. Barclay completed his second term as DGA president in June 2017. He was succeeded by Thomas Schlamme, whom he worked with on The West Wing and Manhattan, as well as on the DGA board. Barclay’s work for the DGA continues even after his presidency: he helped create and teaches the Guild's First Time Director Orientation., and in the successful 2020 contract negotiations Barclay co- chaired the Television Creative Rights Committee. Reputation in the entertainment industry During his three decades as a director, Barclay has developed a strong reputation as a go-to director capable of working adeptly in multiple genres - described in a June 2011 article in Variety as a \\"highly adaptive force with the ability to control both TV detectives and scene- stealing gleesters\\". The same article ranked Barclay among the \\"Ten TV Directors Who Leave Their Mark.\\" and another called him “one of the most reputable TV directors in Hollywood.” https://blog.viff.org/2018/10/05/5-reasons-why-paris-barclay-is-one-of-the- most-reputable-tv-directors-in-hollywood/ Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter stated in an interview with The Star-Ledger that it wasn't until Paris came on board to direct that the show found its \\"groove\\", observing: \\"We had all those glitches in those first two or three episodes [...] We had (Paris) come in [...] and we all just started trusting what we were doing here.\\" Later in an interview for Variety, Kurt stated \\"The great thing about (exec producer Paris Barclay) is that he's a writer and he's also a director [...] so he can get the scripts and understand the production realities of it but also understand creatively what the need for everything is.\\" In an interview with TV Fanatic, Glee actor Blake Jenner credited Barclay for guiding him through a difficult scene in the episode \\"Lights Out\\", saying \\"He was just so nurturing.\\" In a piece for Vulture, television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cites Barclay as one of the few producer/directors who can \\"manage and drive the medium [of television]\\" as well as a writer-showrunner can. Seitz explains, \\"Directors tend to think in terms of images and moments; those skill sets aren’t often compatible with the left-brain requirements of managing a sitcom or drama (though there are always exceptions; see veteran TV director Paris Barclay’s executive-producer credit on FX’s stylishly nasty biker drama, Sons of Anarchy).\\" Ryan Murphy, creator of the Fox hit Glee, called Paris' episode \\"Wheels\\" a \\"turning point for the show\\". Over time, many of Paris Barclay’s former assistants have gone on to great Hollywood success in their own right. One of his first assistants was Kevin Williamson, writer of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and the creator and Executive Producer of the hit television shows Dawson’s Creek, The Vampire Diaries, and The Following. Josh Barry, another former Barclay assistant, was the head of the television department at Prospect Park after working as an executive in Drama Development at ABC. He was recently tapped to be the President of Shawn Levy's 21 Laps Television as part of a major deal with Netflix. Sam Martin, the former HBO executive (Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Lackwanna Blues) and film producer (Pariah) and Jason Clodfelter, former VP of Drama Development, and now Co- President at Sony Television, both previously served as Barclay assistants. Awards Along with winning two Emmy Awards for NYPD Blue (Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series - \\"Lost Israel part II\\" and \\"Hearts and Souls\\"), Barclay has garnered another six Emmy nominations: two for producing NYPD Blue (Outstanding Drama Series), one for directing The West Wing (Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series - \\"Indians In The Lobby\\"), and three for directing Glee (Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series - \\"Wheels\\", \\"Diva\\" and \\"100\\"). He has also received a Directors Guild of America Award for NYPD Blue and 10 other DGA Award nominations for The West Wing (3), In Treatment (2), NYPD Blue (2), ER, House, and Glee. In 2007, he and Taylor Hackford were recipients of the DGA Robert B. Aldrich Award, for Distinguished Service to the Directors Guild. Barclay received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Drama Series as co-creator, writer, and director of the groundbreaking medical drama City of Angels, another Image Award for directing Cold Case, and a third Image Award for directing Smash. He has been nominated for the Image Award for Directing every year it has been offered, from 2006 to 2013. On February 22, 2014 the NAACP honored Paris by inducting him into the NAACP Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame Award is bestowed on an individual who is a pioneer in his or her respective field and whose influence will shape the profession for generations to come. Other recipients have included Lena Horne, Paul Robeson, Sidney Poitier, Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey. Also a writer, Paris received his first WGA Award nomination for co-writing Pedro with screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, marking the Oscar-winner's first WGA credit. The moving story of The Real World's Pedro Zamora garnered the team nominations for a GLAAD Media Award and Humanitas Prize. Episodes directed by Paris for Glee and In Treatment have become the recipients of the prestigious Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. The Glee episode \\"Wheels\\" was also acknowledged at the 2010 Shane's Inspiration Gala, receiving the Visionary Leadership Award for shining a light on the abilities of those with disabilities. The Glee episode, \\"Wheels\\" and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode, \\"Coup de Grace\\" were both chosen for the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Television Academy Honor, saluting \\"Television with a Conscience,\\" in which the Academy recognizes achievements in programming that present issues of concern to society in \\"a compelling, emotional, and insightful way.\\" Barclay also accepted the Voice Award from the US Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of In Treatment, for \\"incorporating dignified, respectful, and accurate portrayals of people with mental illnesses.\\" In June 2011, Advertising Age featured Paris on the cover as one of 2011's 50 Most Creative People, saying \\"Mr. Barclay brings an innate cultural awareness to shows.\\" TV Guide also recognized his House episode, \\"Three Stories\\", as one of the 100 Best Episodes of All Time. In April 2017, Paris was awarded the Order of the Golden Sphinx by the acclaimed Hasty Pudding Institute of Harvard University – it is the highest honor bestowed by the Institute and recognizes individuals in the entertainment industry for their extraordinary contributions to the performing arts. The recipient represents the Institute’s mission to support and foster performing arts within its membership, at Harvard, and around the world.

Work in musical theater In the theater, Barclay presented his original musical On Hold With Music at Manhattan Theater Club in 1984, with a cast including Jason Alexander, Terry Burrell, John Dossett, Ray Gill, and Maureen Brennan. Based on his life in advertising, Barclay wrote and composed the sung through musical in its entirety. In 1985, he wrote the book, music and lyrics for another musical drama entitled Almos' a Man, based on a short story by Richard Wright – which had been developed in the second year of the ASCAP Musical Theater Workshop in New York, under the tutelage of Charles Strouse and Stephen Sondheim. It was produced that year at Soho Rep, receiving a mixed review from the New York Times’ Mel Gussow. After years of directing, Barclay returned to composing in September 2001 with the premiere of a musical based on the collection of letters Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam. Called Letters from ‘Nam, the play featured Grammy winner Maureen McGovern, future Tony winner Levi Kreis, and David Burnham. Praised by most reviewers and opening days before the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Vietnam musical hit home emotionally with those who performed in it, produced it, or experienced it. In 2003, Barclay wrote songs for and co-directed \\"Order My Steps\\" for the Cornerstone Theater Company. The musical play, with book by Tracey Scott Wilson, dealt with the African-American church’s response to the AIDS epidemic. The Los Angeles Times call a \\"moving tale about the human toll of AIDS.\\" Barclay returned to Vietnam with One Red Flower: Letters from ‘Nam, a reworked version of the musical was produced at the Village Theater in Issaquah to further acclaim, with Levi Kreis and David Burnham reprising their roles. Other productions followed, with the most significant being Eric Schaeffer’s \\"gritty and emotional\\" staging at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia in 2004. In 2008, Barclay presented a reading of One Red Flower in Los Angeles to benefit New Directions, an organization that supports veterans of all wars. Maureen McGovern, Levi Kreis and David Burnham returned in featured roles, with television stars Hunter Parrish and Josh Henderson. Although it was not a full production, again it received glowing reviews, described by Beverly Cohn in the Santa Monica Mirror as an \\"evening that had the audience smiling with a lump in its throat.\\" Personal life Openly gay since late in his college days, he was a regular contributor to The Advocate for several years. Barclay married food-industry executive Christopher Barclay (né Mason), his partner of 19 years, in 2008. They have 2 children.

All these can be divided into two groups by using the water- flow gradient as either low gradient channels for streams or rivers with less than two percent (2%) flow gradient, or high gradient channels for those with greater than a 2% gradient. Low gradient channels Low gradient channels of rivers and streams can be divided into braided rivers, wandering rivers, single thread sinuous rivers (meandering), and anastomosing rivers. The channel type developed depends on stream gradient, riparian vegetation and sediment supply. Braided rivers tend to occur on steeper gradients where there is a large supply of sediment for braid bars, while single thread sinuous channels occur where there is a lower sediment supply for point bars. Anastomosing channels are multithreaded, but are much more stable than braided channels and commonly have thick clay and silt banks and occur at lower gradients of stream bed. Wandering rivers fall between sinuous single thread and braided streams and are relatively stable multi-channel gravel bed rivers. High gradient channels High gradient channels of rivers and streams have been divided into riffle-pool (which can cover all of the low gradient channel morphologies discussed above), rapid/plane bed, step-pool and cascade unit morphologies. *Riffle-pool sequence channels are composed of migrating pools and transverse bars called riffles and occur on gradients less than 1-2 percent. *Rapids (also called plane bed, but not to be confused with the plane beds described in sand bed rivers) lack distinct pools and bars but commonly have stone cells or clusters and occur on gradients in the range of 1-5 percent, and have \\"whitewater\\". *Step-pools are composed of channel-spanning pools and boulder/cobble steps that cause subcritical flow in the pool and supercritical flow over the steps. They occur in gradients in the range of 5 and 20%. *Cascade units exist at steeper gradients (approx > 10–15 percent) where the channel is dominated by boulders and cobbles and channel spanning pools do not exist. Pocket pools are common. In all four channel types large woody debris may strongly influence the channel type.

The largest town of the Peninsula, Kadina is one of the three Copper Triangle towns famous for their shared copper mining history. The three towns are known as \\"Little Cornwall\\" for the significant number of immigrants from Cornwall who worked at the mines in the late 19th century. Kadina's surrounds form an important agricultural base for the region, and are used for growing cereal crops. Kadina used to be a mining town but now the majority of Kadina's land is used for farming. Description Kadina is about north-east of Moonta and east of the port town of Wallaroo. There are 6 suburbs making up Kadina's township, each being a distinct historic locality or hamlet. These are: Jericho, Jerusalem, Matta Flat, New Town and Wallaroo Mines as well as central Kadina itself. Kadina East was previously a gazetted suburb east of Kadina's centre, later merged into Kadina itself. History=Aboriginal The Narungga are the group of Indigenous Australians whose traditional lands include what is now termed Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. The name \\"Kadina\\" is thought to be derived from Kadiyinya, a Narungga word meaning 'Lizard Plain'. European Copper was discovered at Wallaroo Mines in 1859 and adjacent land north east of the site was surveyed in 1861 to house miners and became the Government Town of Kadina. Exceptional amounts of copper were found in the following years. Copper was also found in large amounts at the nearby Matta Mine and Doora Mine. The copper mines attracted many highly experienced Cornish miners to Kadina. In 1862, the Hundred of Wallaroo and Hundred of Kadina were proclaimed in order to allow parcels of land to be sold in the vicinity of the copper mines. In the same year a horse-drawn railway from Kadina to the port at Wallaroo, west of the town, was opened. Further lines connecting Kadina to Port Wakefield, to the southeast, and Bute, to the northeast (Kadina-Brinkworth railway line), opened in 1878 and 1879, respectively. In 1872 Kadina became a municipality by establishment of the Corporate Town of Kadina. By 1875, the population had increased to 20,000, mostly composed of Cornish miners. In 1907 the adjacent Government Town of Kadina East was surveyed west of Eliza Terrace to cope with the need to house the growing population of the town. Mining at Kadina ceased completely in 1938, and the rail lines fell into disuse and were closed in 1989. Heritage listings Kadina has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Drain Road: Kadina Cemetery * 36-38 Taylor Street: Humphries Barber Shop * 51 Taylor Street: Kadina Town Hall Geography and climate Kadina exists in a semi-arid location, above Goyder's Line, and is surrounded by mallee scrub. It is located 8 kilometres inland and 44 metres above sea level. Kadina has a borderline dry Mediterranean/Semi-Arid climate (Koppen:Csa/Bsh) with seasonal temperatures a few degrees above Adelaide's temperatures. The average winter temperature is 15.4 °C and the average summer temperature is 30.5 °C. Average rainfall of Kadina is 388.8 millimetres. The weather patterns are similar to those of Adelaide. Governance Kadina is located within the local government area of the Copper Coast Council, which was formed in 1997. The Copper Coast Council replaced the District Council of Kadina, which existed from 1888 to 1984, and the District Council of Northern Yorke Peninsula. The Corporate Town of Kadina, which had existed since 1872, was previously merged into the District Council of Kadina in 1977. Kadina is part of the federal division of Grey and lies within the state electoral district of Narungga. Local economy=Mining Kadina was once chiefly a copper mining town with the Wallaroo Mines being south-westerly adjacent to the township. Since the closure of the mine in the 1920s, agriculture has been the dominant local industry. Broadacre cropping Kadina is surrounded by lands used for broadacre cereal cropping. Staples such as barley, wheat as well as various oilseeds and legumes like canola, chickpeas and field peas are commonly grown in the area. Barley and wheat from the region is considered to be some of the best in the world. Tourism The town today consists of important historical colonial and federation buildings gathered around Victoria Square. Kadina also contains the Farm Shed Museum & Tourism Centre (Kadina Heritage Museum) and remnants of the Wallaroo Mines. Kernewek Lowender, a Cornish festival, is held every odd year in May in Kadina (as well as Moonta and Wallaroo, with each location hosting the festival for one day). Kadina and its surrounds benefit generally from the tourism throughout the Copper Triangle and has experienced general growth due throughout the 2000s and 2010s due to the Copper Cove housing development at Wallaroo. Media The town serves as the base for local radio station Gulf FM, broadcasting at 89.3 FM. The Yorke Peninsula Country Times newspaper is based in Kadina.

It is one of three towns known as the Copper Coast or \\"Little Cornwall\\" for their shared copper mining history. Description The town's centre is about south west of Kadina, site of Wallaroo Mines, and south of the port of Wallaroo. There are 11 suburbs surrounding central Moonta, each being a distinct historic locality or hamlet. These are: Cross Roads, East Moonta, Hamley, Kooroona, Moonta Bay, Moonta Mines, North Moonta, North Yelta, Paramatta, Port Hughes and Yelta. At the 2011 census, the Moonta township and the adjacent suburbs of Cross Roads and Yelta had a combined population of 681. The broader Moonta urban centre, also including Moonta Bay, North Moonta and Port Hughes, had a population of 3,659. By 2016, the area had grown to a population of 4,700, making it the fastest growing area on the Copper Coast. History=Aboriginal The Moonta area is part of the traditional lands of the indigenous Narungga people. The name \\"Moonta\\" is reportedly derived from munta-muntara or moontera, an Aboriginal word for \\"thick scrub place\\" or \\"impenetrable scrub\\". European The Yorke Peninsula coastline near Wallaroo was separately navigated by Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin in 1802. The next Europeans to explore the district were John Hill and Thomas Burr. Under instructions from Governor Gawler, the pair were landed about 15 kilometres south of Point Riley, near Moonta Bay, on 28 April 1840 from the government cutter Water Witch.http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au:80/record=b2175295~S1  Map of route. They then made their way back to Adelaide on horseback, traversing Northern Yorke Peninsula.State Library of S.A. Archival Maps, C 223, Outsize 6. They reported the discovery of 'a very excellent tract of country'.Register, 9 May 1840, p.5 Based on that report a few pioneering British settlers arrived in the Moonta area in the 1840s, as pastoralists, but there was no significant development until the 1860s, primarily because of the lack of water. The scrub in the area was difficult to penetrate (as testified by the town's name) so the first settlers had a hard time clearing the land. Large and rich deposits of copper were discovered at Moonta in 1861 by Patrick Ryan, a shepherd from Walter Hughes' property. This became a prosperous mine, named Wheal Hughes, with other mines soon to follow. The government town of Moonta was surveyed in March 1863, while an informal township of mining workers also grew at Moonta Mines. A horse tramway from Moonta to the port at Wallaroo opened in July 1866. Starting in the 1880s, agitation for conversion of the horse tramway to a steam locomotive railway commenced. Following advertising by the South Australian Government, Cornish miners arrived in Moonta in large numbers.For a discussion of the development of \\"Cornishness\\" see Philip Payton Making Moonta: The Invention of ‘Australia’s Little Cornwall, Exeter, University of Exeter Press, 2007 paperback The government town of Moonta incorporated as the Corporate Town of Moonta in 1872. The mines at Moonta proved to be the richest mines in the whole of South Australia by 1917, exceeding the total wealth created by all other mines since 1836, the year of establishment of South Australia. The population of Moonta in 1875 was 12,000. The main copper mining operations at Moonta Mines ceased in 1923, although a number of smaller mines continued to be worked for some years. Smaller-scale operations recommenced in the area in the late 1980s but had closed by the mid-1990s. Following the demise of copper mining, the district successfully merged into dry land farming. Moonta's surrounds are used for growing barley, wheat and other crops such as legumes, canola, chickpeas and field peas. Barley from the region is considered to be some of the best in the world. Heritage listings Moonta's town centre, consisting of old limestone miners' cottages and churches, gives the town a historical feel. Moonta has a number of heritage-listed sites listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, including: * Blanche Terrace: All Saints Anglican Church * Blanche Terrace: Moonta Masonic Hall * 21 Ellen Street: Bank of South Australia Building * 29 Ellen Street: Moonta School of Mines * Kadina Road: Moonta railway station Geography and climate Moonta exists in a semi-arid location, above Goyder's Line. Moonta is surrounded by mallee scrub. The centre is located four kilometres inland and is 20 metres above sea level. Moonta has a dry Mediterranean climate with seasonal temperatures about the same as Adelaide's temperatures. The temperature ranges are similar to those of Kadina and the weather patterns are similar to those of both Kadina and Adelaide. Local economy Tourism is a significant local industry, focusing on the availability of beach-side accommodation, including several caravan parks, holiday houses, bed and breakfast and a motel. The nearby locations of Moonta Bay, Port Hughes and Simms Cove are on the foreshore and are rapidly developing. They are extremely popular locations for retirement and holiday makers. The beaches, with fine white sand, are popular with recreational anglers and sailboarders. The natural state of the coast has largely been retained. The popular three-day Kernewek Lowender Cornish festival is also held every odd year in May in the Copper Coast towns of Moonta, Kadina and Wallaroo, with events staged across the three towns over several days. The National Trust of South Australia operates a number of heritage attractions in adjacent Moonta Mines, including a narrow gauge railway through the former mining works, a museum in the former Moonta Mines Model School, a sweet shop, former mining cottage and surviving buildings associated with the mines. The former Moonta railway station is now a visitor information centre.  Governance  Moonta is located within the local government area of the Copper Coast Council, which was formed in 1997 (replacing the Corporate Town of Moonta, which existed from 1872 to 1984, and the District Council of Northern Yorke Peninsula). As such, it remains part of the Hundred of Wallaroo which itself is part of the County of Daly. It is also part of the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Narungga.  Media  Moonta was served by The People’s Weekly (17 May 1890 – 22 September 1961). The newspaper was then renamed to Moonta People’s Weekly (29 September 1961 – 31 March 1966), which then merged with the Kadina and Wallaroo Times (1 August 1888 to March 1966) to form the short-lived Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta Times (7 April 1966 – 29 August 1968). In 1968 that paper then merged with the South Australian Farmer (9 January 1948 – 28 August 1968) to form the Yorke Peninsula Country Times, which still serves the entire peninsula.

Plot  High school freshman Airi Hoshina's only ambition in life is to someday live in a cozy home with a loving husband and find joy in the little things in life. She revolves all her activities and hobbies around this concept including getting to school on time every day because the school legend says that the longer one's non-tardy streak is, the better boyfriend one will find. However, her perfectly mapped out life ambition is derailed when she drops a small mirror that has been passed down in her family for generations on her way to school. Upon returning to retrieve the trinket she discovers it in the possession a cheeky, strangely dressed 7 year-old. She at first fails to retrieve the mirror by rushing off when the first bell rings so she doesn't break her no tardy rule. When she returns and finds the boy still waiting in the same spot with the mirror, he introduces himself as Aram and says he came through the mirror and is waiting for his companion to contact him. Realizing he is alone and thinking he is a foreigner from the embassy, Airi invites him to wait for his companion at her house so he isn't by himself in the city. She welcomes the company since her parents have been traveling abroad for several years and her grandparents often vacation leaving her living in her house alone the majority of the time. The two develop a friendship quickly as Aram likes that she treats him like any other person, and he stays the night in Airi's room since his companion has yet to contact him. Airi wakes up the next morning to the surprise of her life when she finds Aram has turned into a 17-year-old overnight. Aram's companion Lei finally appears through Airi's mirror and explains that Aram is actually the youngest prince of a magic kingdom called Astale. He reveals that she is actually a descendant of Princess Chrisnele, who is considered a traitor for abandoning her kingdom for love in Airi's world. The mirror was a portal that belonged to her. Aram fled through a separate portal to her world because his older brother Jeile attempted to place a curse on him that would age him into an old man and seal off his magic when he is engulfed in darkness. Aram was slow to escape the spell, and a partial amount of it still took effect aging him into a teenager and making his magic exceptionally difficult to control. Lei declares that the only thing that can restore Aram to his true form is the kiss of one's most beloved maiden. As Aram is too young to have such a woman he declares that Airi, the closest thing he has had to a female friend, is his most beloved maiden. Airi is against the idea as she wants to save her first kiss for her soul mate leaving her and Aram stuck together until he turns back into his true form and can use magic again.  Characters  ; :Drama CD voice actress - Fumiko Orikasa This 15-year-old, happy-go-lucky heroine of the story, Airi, dreams of a warm and peaceful married life like what she sees on her favorite TV drama, Tales of Marriage on the Plains. Her parents work abroad, and she lives with her grandparents she never sees, she would be alone if not for her two dogs, Pochirou and Koromi. Airi has a hand mirror in the shape of a seven-pointed star that has been passed down through her family since the days of her great- great-great grandmother, which can be used as a portal to the magical kingdom of Astale. In fact, Airi's great-great-great grandmother was a traitorous princess from Astale, Chrisnelle, making her a direct descendant of the royal family. Airi's first impression of Aram is that he is a cute little boy, but he quickly comes to stand in the way of her plans of living a normal life. Her dreams of a normal marriage disappear when she unwittingly performs marriage vows with him. Because of the vows, she and Aram both now have matching insignias on their chests. If any man aside from Aram kisses the symbol, then her heart will stop beating. However, she slowly becomes fond of Aram and finally realizes her feelings during their high school summer trip to the beach, where Raz tries to kill her by kissing the symbol on her chest. After that, she was completely devoted to Aram. Although, encounters with Aram's former fiance Mariabel causes problems when she removes Aram's memories and feelings for Airi by the help of Raz. Airi can't let Aram go as she constantly tries to get him to remember her. Ten years after, on Aram's 17th birthday, at the ceremony of coming of age, they officially get married when she is at the age of 25. (ch 22) ; :Drama CD voice actresses - Yuki Kaida as child Aram and Hikaru Midorikawa as adult Aram A 7-year old prince of the magical kingdom of Astale, his full name is Astale Ae Daemonia Eucharista Aram. Aram came to Airi's world to avoid a spell his half-brother Jeile was trying to cast on him. Because Aram was slow to escape the spell and that he got hit by half of it, its effect wasn't as Jeile intended. It was supposed to age Aram to an old man overnight in the dark, but it ends up growing him into a 17-year-old whenever he is in darkness. The only way to return him to his proper form is with a kiss from his most beloved maiden, whom he quickly determines to be Airi. He is always quick to proclaim his everlasting love for her, much to Airi's chagrin at first. When Aram had his memories removed by the box Raz gave Mariabel, he becomes aloof and indifferent towards Airi, However, he feels slightly disturbed around her and doesn't know why. But then he kisses Airi once more and returns to his original form, confirming Airi's love for him and she is his most beloved. Occasionally, Aram enjoys teasing Airi, for instance when Airi touched Aram's body while he was sleeping when he was actually awake, telling her she could do anything to him if she wanted to. In some ways Aram is a typical little boy, and he develops a fondness for things like sentaiyuti shows (especially The Sparkle Rangers) and rice omelettes, but he also has an exceedingly regal bearing and often seems twice his real age. Although formally engaged to Mariabel, Aram makes Airi perform Astale's traditional marriage vows with him in order to save her from going to the Eternal Prison. At first, their marriage is not recognized by anyone in Astale until volume 4 where Aram officially places their marriage into the \\"Book of Oaths\\". However, their official wedding is not until Aram comes of age 10 years later (when he is 17), in chapter 22. At this time Jeile performs a reversal spell on him, causing him to turn into a little kid when it goes dark. ; : Drama CD voice actor - Daisuke Kishio Aram's older half-brother and the crown prince of Astale; his full name is Astale Ae Daemonia Eucharista Jeile. He is eccentric and a playboy. He cast the aging spell on Aram out of frustration because Aram receives all of their father's attention. In actuality, Jeile really does care about Aram, and it's likely he simply never considered the consequences of the spell. Though he seems like a bungler at first, Jeile is the commander of Astale's magical army. When Aram loses his memory, he helps Airi and even assists her on being by her side while she is in their realm. Jeile has a bit of a masochistic streak; he becomes smitten with Airi after she slaps him, and tries to get her to become his first wife. He calls Airi his Mountain Lily Maiden and tries to be happy for her after she becomes Aram's fiance. When Aram turns 17 he reverses the spell so Aram turns into a child in the dark after hearing Airi complain about never being able to see him little again. When he was about twelve years old, his first love was Lei (he did not know that Lei was a boy at the time due to Lei's long hair and rather feminine appearance). His fiancé is Lei's sister, Nei. When Jeile meets her, he can't bear to see her face because it is identical to Lei's. However, five years later when Jeile is King of Astale (after the former king and queen retired) he accepts Nei and they even have two children, whose names are not revealed. ; : Drama CD voice actor - Nozomu Sasaki Aram's caretaker, he is a conscientious civil servant and attentive to Aram. However, he has no respect for Airi, and is troubled about Aram's fondness for her. He's about nineteen years old. He is also in love with Queen Veedua, as revealed in volume 4. His sister Nei is identical to him. He had to impersonate Airi while she was learning magic in Astale. Everyone in school was fooled except for Nakaoji, whose ancestor was a great magician of Astale. Lei has another form, which resembles a phoenix. ; : Drama CD voice actor - Atsushi Kisaichi The president of Airi's class and, though he might not know it, Airi's current prime marriage candidate. He seems rather taken with Airi himself. Nakaoji is sporty, friendly, and good with kids, though he and Aram sparred. This is because Nakaoji had lost patience with Aram who disliked him right from the start, as he knew that Airi liked Nakaoji and was determined to get catch Airi's heart. His ancestor was the Grand Magician of Astale who first established the seven royal families of Astelle. ; A member of one of Astale's royal houses, the Zehrotuhia house, his full name is Zerothuhia Razalude, but he usually goes by Raz. His family would've been the rulers of Astale if not for the betrayal of Airi's ancestor, the princess Chrisnele. For this reason, Raz seems determined to inflict his family's misfortune on Airi but in volume 4, it is revealed that actually, he likes her and that the reason that he tried to kill her was because he had a deal with her majesty Queen Veedua that if he helped her in this task she must let him travel wherever he likes. In volume 4, he is summoned by Nakaoji's little sister, who hopes to get him to kill her brother for telling their Mom not to get her a cell phone. He is said to be about sixteen years old. ; Aram's fiancé. Mariabel is certain that she is the best match for Aram, and steals Aram's memories of Airi to win him back to her. She is dismayed that Aram continues to pursue Airi and that only Airi's kiss is able to turn him back to normal. She realizes her foolishness and becomes friends with Airi. ; : Drama CD voice actress - Ema Kogure Jeile's fairy. She got into his bedroom searching a flower to live with, as fairies spend their lives sharing energy with flowers. She had chosen a ribbon instead, by accident since it had a rose pattern on it, and Jeile, to save her, created a magic ribbon over her head which matched the one around his hair. In this way, she could share his life force and in this way grow. Jeile is scolded for this, as it supposedly makes him appear \\"soft\\" and unworthy to command the Astale magical army, but he nonetheless does not regret his decision. In volume 4, Maruru fully matures and becomes larger, so that she is the size of a normal woman. ;Queen Veedua Aram's mother and a very intimidating woman. She and the king have a 100-year age gap. Veedua is very playful to the point of appearing cruel (Jeile, Lei and Aram's opinion of her). To test their love she makes them go through a trial where Airi is required to find the lost ring of Chrisnelle which is given to all children of royalty when they are born. She was the one to make the plan to steal Aram's memories of Airi. However, upon meeting Airi, Veedua becomes quite fond of her, due to hearing of how Airi made Aram clean her bathroom and never hesitates to tell Aram to shut up. ;Hirata Ayashi : Drama CD voice actor - Jun Fukuyama Airi's friend from junior high-school who used to have a crush on her. Airi rejected Hirata's confession on their graduation day and so made fun of Airi's imagination. He met Airi again in the theme park in chapter 1 of the manga and once again ridiculed her in front of his girlfriend (voiced by Asami Imai in the drama CD) and said that no one would want to be Airi's boyfriend until he saw Aram. ;Umi Nakaoji Naokaoji's little sister, who summons Raz in order to get rid of her big brother once and for all so that she talk to the boy she likes and start using her cellphone again. She calls Raz \\"Demon\\", probably because of the way they met (via summoning). It isn't actually known what happens to her after that, however there is a woman that looks a lot like her on the last page Raz appears in. If it is her, more than likely Umi decided to further her interest in magic. Reception On Anime News Network, Zac Bertschy gave volume 1 a grade of C+ for the story and B+ for the art.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. In animal studies it was found to have low toxicity, although in rats evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis occurred with pulmonary foam cells developing with long-term use of very high doses. Its elimination half-life is 51–103 hours. Its mechanism of action is similar to other benzodiazepines. Ethyl loflazepate also produces an active metabolite which is stronger than the parent compound. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug for descarboxyloflazepate, its active metabolite. It is the active metabolite which is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects rather than ethyl loflazepate. The main metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate. Accumulation of the active metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are not affected by those with kidney failure or impairment. The symptoms of an overdose of ethyl loflazepate include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. These symptoms occur much more frequently and severely in children. Death from therapeutic maintenance doses of ethyl loflazepate taken for 2 – 3 weeks has been reported in 3 elderly patients. The cause of death was asphyxia due to benzodiazepine toxicity. High doses of the antidepressant fluvoxamine may potentiate the adverse effects of ethyl loflazepate.

The movement of the wires occurs most commonly in the vertical plane, although horizontal or rotational motion is also possible. The natural frequency mode tends to be around 1 Hz, leading the often graceful periodic motion to also be known as conductor dancing. The oscillations can exhibit amplitudes in excess of a metre, and the displacement is sometimes sufficient for the phase conductors to infringe operating clearances (coming too close to other objects), and causing flashover. The forceful motion also adds significantly to the loading stress on insulators and electricity pylons, raising the risk of mechanical failure of either. The mechanisms that initiate gallop are not always clear, though it is thought to be often caused by asymmetric conductor aerodynamics due to ice build up on one side of a wire. The crescent of encrusted ice approximates an aerofoil, altering the normally round profile of the wire and increasing the tendency to oscillate. Gallop can be a significant problem for transmission system operators, particularly where lines cross open, windswept country and are at risk to ice loading. If gallop is likely to be a concern, designers can employ smooth-faced conductors, whose improved icing and aerodynamic characteristics reduce the motion. Additionally, anti-gallop devices may be mounted to the line to convert the lateral motion to a less damaging twisting one. Increasing the tension in the line and adopting more rigid insulator attachments have the effect of reducing galloping motion. These measures can be costly, are often impractical after the line has been constructed, and can increase the tendency for the line to exhibit high frequency oscillations. If ice loading is suspected, it may be possible to increase power transfer on the line, and so raise its temperature by Joule heating, melting the ice. The sudden loss of ice from a line can result in a phenomenon called \\"jump\\", in which the catenary dramatically rebounds upwards in response to the change in weight. If the risk of trip is high, the operator may elect to pre-emptively switch out the line in a controlled manner rather than face an unexpected fault. The risk of mechanical failure of the line remains.  Conductor gallop analysis  Conductor gallop analysis overlaps several academic disciplines. Mechanical vibrations covers the laws of motion of the conductor and the long conductor acts as a mass suspended by an elastic spring obeying Hooke's law. Within the discipline of mechanical vibration, conductor gallop is categorized as a self-excited vibration because the forces which generate conductor gallop are generated by the motion itself. One of the early leaders in modern mechanical vibrations, J. P. Den Hartog, described conductor gallop in a chapter on self-excited vibrations in his text book Mechanical Vibrations, copyrighted in 1956 and reprinted by Dover Publications, where he develops general stability criteria for conductor gallop but without a complete mathematical solution. However, conductor gallop analysis also relates to Civil engineering because the electric conductors are carried by towers and the study of wind influences on structures, including any kind of vibration, has been much studied, especially after the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge due to flutter from the structural members. In fact, perfectly round electrical conductors experience vortex shedding in certain ranges of the Reynolds number. The underlying behavior in the conductor gallop phenomenon also applies to other civil engineering structural elements such as cables and stays on bridges. A more recent reference related to the analysis of conductor gallop is Flow-Induced Vibrations, An Engineering Guide, by Eduard Naudascher and Donald Rockwell copyrighted in 1994 and still published by Dover Publications in 2005, in which experimental data related to vortex shedding frequencies as well as the aerodynamic forces on various structure shapes including cylinder models for a conductor or cable. Another book titled Flow-Induced Vibration by Robert D. Blevins, 2nd Edition published by Van Nostrand-Reinhold in 1990, also treats conductor gallop while reporting experimental data related to vortex shedding and aerodynamic forces on various structural shapes. Both of the last- mentioned works include references to scientific and engineering journal articles, many of which directly relate to conductor gallop. In aeronautical engineering the term \\"flutter\\" is used to describe conductor gallop and analogous other phenomena involving aerodynamic forces interacting with elastic structures having inertial mass.  Flutter  A similar aeolian phenomenon is flutter, caused by vortices on the leeward side of the wire, and which is distinguished from gallop by its high-frequency (10 Hz), low- amplitude motion. To control flutter, transmission lines may be fitted with tuned mass dampers (known as Stockbridge dampers) clamped to the wires close to the towers. The use of bundle conductor spacers can also be of benefit.

The series follows Haruhi Fujioka, a scholarship student at Ouran High School, and the other members of the popular host club. The romantic comedy focuses on the relationships within and outside the Club and satirizes the clichés and stereotypes that endure in shōjo manga. The manga has been adapted into a series of audio dramas, an animated television series directed by Takuya Igarashi and produced by Bones, a Japanese television drama series, a live action film adaptation and a visual novel by Idea Factory. Plot The comedic series revolves around the escapades of Haruhi Fujioka, a scholarship student at the prestigious Ouran Academy, a fictitious high school for rich kids located in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the abandoned Third Music Room, a place where the Ouran Academy Host Club, a group of six male students, gathers to entertain female \\"clients\\" with sweets and tea. During their initial encounter, Haruhi accidentally destroys an antique vase valued at ¥8,000,000 (around US$80,000) and must work off the debt as the club's errand boy. Her short hair, slouching attire, and gender-ambiguous face cause her to be mistaken by the Hosts for a male student, though they soon realize her actual gender and the fact that she's a \\"natural\\" in entertaining girls, promoting her to full-Host status. Media=Manga The Ouran High School Host Club manga was serialized in Japan between the September 2002 and November 2010 issues of LaLa. The individual chapters were collected in 18 tankōbon volumes between August 5, 2003 and April 5, 2011. Hakusensha released a fanbook for the series on August 4, 2009 titled . The series is licensed in English North America by Viz Media under its Shojo Beat imprint, and in Indonesia in the monthly manga magazine Hanalala. It is published in Singapore (in both simplified Chinese and English) by Chuang Yi, and in Poland by JPF. Anime A 26-episode anime television series aired between April 5 and September 26, 2006 on NTV. The series was produced by Nippon Television, VAP, Bones and Hakusensha. It was directed by Takuya Igarashi, with Yōji Enokido handling series composition and writing the scripts, Kumiko Takahashi designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. It features a different cast from the audio dramas, with Maaya Sakamoto as Haruhi Fujioka and Mamoru Miyano as Tamaki Suoh. The series is licensed for distribution in North America by Funimation Entertainment. Caitlin Glass is the ADR director of the series. The first anime DVD set containing the first thirteen episodes was released on October 28, 2008 in North America. The second volume containing the last thirteen episodes was released on January 6, 2009. On April 27, 2009, the series made its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel. Music and audio CDs Three drama CDs were released in 2003, as well as two tracks included in LaLa magazine's 28th and 29th anniversary CDs. Three soundtracks were released by Video and Audio Project for the Ouran High School Host Club anime adaptation. The first, Ouran High School Host Club Soundtrack & Character Song Collection (Part 1), was released in Japan on July 26, 2006 and contained twenty tracks, including the anime opening theme song. The second, Ouran High School Host Club Soundtrack & Character Song Collection 2, contained an additional nineteen tracks and was released on August 23, 2006. On September 20, 2007, a third soundtrack, the Ouran High School Host Club Soundtrack & Character Song Collection Special Edition was released containing eight songs from the previous two tracks, with four additional songs. Visual novel The Ouran Host Club visual novel was released for PlayStation 2 on April 19, 2007 by Idea Factory. Based on the television series, the player makes decisions as Haruhi that affect the other hosts feelings toward her. The game features the characters of Jean-Pierre Léo, a longtime French friend of Tamaki, and Sayuri Himemiya, a childhood friend of Haruhi, designed by the series creator. There are two other original characters. The game has been released exclusively in Japan. A Nintendo DS port of the game, updated with a fully voiced cast and new character-specific scenarios, was released on March 19, 2009. Live-action TV series and film A live-action TV series of Ouran began airing in Japan on TBS on July 22, 2011. The live-action adaption features Yusuke Yamamoto as Tamaki Suou and Haruna Kawaguchi as Haruhi Fujioka. A live-action film of Ouran was announced during a fan meeting on August 25, 2011 and continues off from the conclusion of the television series. All actors of the live-action television series reprised their roles. The film was released on March 17, 2012. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on October 10, 2012. The series had a spin-off named Ouran High School Host Club: Haruhi no Happy Birthday Daisakusen with the same cast that was originally broadcast on January 6, 2012 by LISMO drama, a mobile drama provided by au. This LISMO drama tells an original story worked on by the author of the manga. The drama revolves around the host club members becoming flustered upon learning that it is Haruhi's birthday. Through their misunderstandings about celebrating her birthday, the members make Haruhi angry. Kawaguchi, who plays Haruhi Fujioka, commented, \\"You will see an explosion of this well-known bright and silly character! It was fun playing the role, and all the host club members enjoyed the filming.\\" Each episode is approximately five minutes long, and there are four episodes. Reception The series is a parody of otaku culture, especially cross-dressing. The club often dresses up in flamboyant costumes, and Renge Hōshakuji is also identified as an otaku. Rose Bridges, writing for Anime News Network, regards Ouran as being the first example of a \\"fujoshi comedy\\" genre—loosely defined as humorous anime with predominantly male casts that cater to shipping- obsessed fangirls. Mangaka Bisco Hatori appeared at Anime Expo 2019 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, USA. During several interviews and panels, she indicated that she would welcome another project concerning the characters and topics covered in Ouran, but is in no position to produce an anime and advised fans to continue petitioning the studio. When asked about the Boy Love suggested in the series, she stated that Ouran has always been meant to be a parody of shōjo manga, but doesn't feel there is a thematic gap between shōjo and BL themes. As for Haruhi being a female, it was revealed that the character was originally meant to be a boy, but one of her editors suggested a gender swap. Thus, Hatori invented a female character that \\"doesn't need to dress up like a boy other than the fact that those are the clothing she wears and likes\\" without subtext. She expressed that she isn't hung up on genre parameters or gender orientation because every person should be proud of being unique while remaining true to themselves. In summation, Hatori stressed Ouran being a story about family and friendship, without any intention of being a pioneer of \\"fujoshi comedy,\\" though admits that it happened just the same.

Current census searches do not indicate a population count, but estimates are three to four hundred in the immediate and surrounding areas. The area was homesteaded and settled in the early 1900s. Many of the families came from the midwest, and several direct descendants (notably the Kuhlmanns, Duchows, Obergs, Bunches, and Vissers) still live there and farm the land. At 3500 feet, the climate is considered semi-arid and farming efforts are seasonal due to the cold and snow. Cattle and some sheep are raised, in addition to wheat, oats, barley, and alfalfa hay. Most crops must rely on snow fall and seasonal rains for dry land farming. Many residents who farm or raise livestock in Havillah supplement their income with jobs in the nearest towns of Tonasket or Oroville about twenty miles \\"down the hill\\". Immanuel Lutheran Congregation (organized January 29, 1905) serves as the community hub, and members and non-members alike attend weekly services and other functions there.

The facility, which was designed by Sir Arnold Thornely in the classical style and built of Portland stone at a cost of was £148,697, was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 14 December 1933. The design included a large Corinthian distyle with pilasters on the first and second floors of the building as well as a high three-stage reducing central tower. George Orwell, in his book The Road to Wigan Pier, was highly critical of this expenditure, and said that the council should have spent the money on improving the housing and living conditions of the local miners.

He received his Juris Doctor degree from Loyola University Chicago School of Law in 1981. Athletic career Thomas had a twelve-year career as a kicker in the National Football League. He played for the Chicago Bears (– and –), the Detroit Lions (1982), the San Diego Chargers (), and the New York Giants (). Legal career He was elected circuit court judge in DuPage County in 1988. There, he presided over civil jury trials and was the Acting Chief Judge from 1989 to 1994. In 1994, Judge Thomas was elected to the Illinois Appellate Court, Second District. On December 4, 2000, Justice Thomas was sworn in as the Illinois Supreme Court Justice for the Second District after defeating incumbent S. Louis Rathje in a contentious primary. Justice Thomas was elected to serve as Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice on September 6, 2005, and served as the Chief Justice until September 5, 2008. In February 2020, he announced he would be resigned from the Supreme Court effective February 29. Ruling on Rahm Emanuel ballot eligibility On January 1, 2011, Justice Thomas authored the Illinois State Supreme Court decision Maksym v. Chicago Board of Elections that overturned a lower court ruling that Rahm Emanuel was ineligible to run for Mayor of Chicago. Honors and awards In April 1996, Thomas was inducted into the Academic All-American Hall of Fame. In January 1999, he received the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award. Justice Thomas is a member of the DuPage County Bar Association. Defamation of character lawsuit In 2007, Justice Thomas was awarded $7 million in a successful defamation of character lawsuit against Bill Page, a former columnist at the Kane County Chronicle. Thomas' lawyers alleged that Page had essentially accused him of official misconduct, a felony. Page wrote in his column that Thomas had traded his vote on a disciplinary case in exchange for political support for his favored candidate in a local judicial race. The case was significant because it prompted an Illinois appellate court to establish a judicial privilege in Illinois, allowing judicial deliberations to be kept private, much like doctor-patient discussions. Later in 2007, after the newspaper filed suit against Thomas in federal court, the parties came together and settled all litigation, with the newspaper agreeing to pay Thomas $3 million.

It was formed in 1995 from the merger of the North County Blade-Citizen of Oceanside (founded 1929) and the Escondido Times-Advocate (founded 1909) by Howard Publications. Beginning in 1997, the Times also published The Californian in Temecula, located in southwest Riverside County. The newspaper was published with three local editions including The Californian. Lee Enterprises acquired Howard in 2002. From 2008 through 2011, the paper laid off dozens of staff members, including at least a third of its editorial/newsroom staff. Doug Manchester, owner of U-T San Diego (known as The San Diego Union-Tribune after 2015), bought the North County Times from Lee Enterprises in September 2012 for just under $12 million. One third of the staff was laid off. Subsequently, the print edition of the newspaper was folded into the U-T and called U-T North County Times, which is an edition of U-T San Diego and combines North County-specific content with features and columns from the U-T. The North County Times headquarters in Escondido were sold to the Classical Academy charter school. On March 7, 2013, the separate U-T North County Times name was dropped and a U-T North County edition produced which further integrates U-T with North County-specific pages, while eliminating differences between the two. Previously both the U-T North County Times and the regular U-T were sold side by side at newsstands. Californian readers were merged into the U-T Californian, which includes a front section of Southwest Riverside County- specific content with the remaining content from the U-T North County edition. As of May 28, 2013, publication of the U-T Californian was terminated, and it was also reported that the distinct content of the North County edition was being de-emphasized.\\"U-T San Diego closes Californian supplement\\", Associated Press in Sacramento Bee, May 28, 2013.Alison St John, \\"U-T San Diego Phases Out North County Edition\\", KPBS.org, May 30, 2013.

It grows in peaty soils, shrubby areas, moss and lichen tundra. Chemical compounds All parts of the plant contain poisonous terpenes that affect the central nervous system. First symptoms of overdose are dizziness and disturbances in movement, followed by spasms, nausea, and unconsciousness. Similar species This species is not to be confused with the traditionally-used one Rhododendron groenlandicum, found throughout Northern North America. Uses=Herbal medicine Rhododendron tomentosum is used in herbalism to make an herbal tea called \\"Labrador tea\\".

His books about language are very well regarded for their clarity and humor and were introduced by such word luminaries as William F. Buckley, Richard Lederer, and Noah Adams, who also featured Mr. Ehrlich's language commentary on his public radio broadcasts. William Safire occasionally cited Mr. Ehrlich in his writing on language. He was quoted as saying that his higher mission was \\"being the antidote to the 'effects wrought by the forces of linguistic darkness.'” Biography Eugene Ehrlich was born in New York City in 1922. He attended CCNY before service in the United States Army during World War II. Trained to interrogate prisoners in Europe at the Army's language school at Boston College, he was reassigned to the Pacific suddenly because events in France were developing too rapidly. He received crash training in Japanese, which he used in the Philippines, New Guinea, and occupied Japan. After the War, he did graduate work at Columbia Teachers College, taught at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and began work as a consultant to industry at Bell Laboratories, where his precise use of language helped scientists and engineers describe and communicate their discoveries. He later worked at Norden Aircraft, Sikorsky, Loral Aerospace and many others where he helped prepare contract proposals for vast government contracts. He married Norma Solway in 1948.

He was the older brother of mathematician Jules Tannery, to whose Notions Mathématiques he contributed an historical chapter. Though Tannery's career was in the tobacco industry, he devoted his evenings and his life to the study of mathematicians and mathematical development. Life and career Tannery was born in Mantes-la- Jolie on 20 December 1843, to a deeply Catholic family. He attended private school in Mantes, followed by the Lycées in Le Mans and Caen. He then entered the École Polytechnique, on whose entrance exam he excelled. His curriculum included mathematics, the sciences, and the classics, all of which would be represented in his future academic work. Tannery's life of public service began as he then entered the École d'Applications des Tabacs as an apprentice engineer. As an assistant engineer, Tannery spent two years in the state tobacco factory at Lille. In 1867, he moved to Paris; three years later, he served as an artillery captain in the Franco-Prussian War. Biographies of Tannery describe him as an ardent patriot and claim that he never fully accepted the humiliating Treaty of Frankfurt. After his graduation from the École Polytechnique, Tannery had become interested in Auguste Comte and his positivist philosophy. After the war, his interest in mathematics continued, and Comte's ideas would influence his approach to the study of the history of science. Tannery moved several times with his career in the tobacco industry: to Périgord in 1872, to Bordeaux in 1874, to Le Havre in 1877, and to Paris in 1883. Bordeaux had something of an intellectual atmosphere, and though Tannery moved to Le Havre (near his parents, who lived at Caen) at his own request, he would also directly request the move to Paris, where his research and academic pursuits would be able to flourish. It was in Paris that Tannery took on his first two major editorial works. In 1883, he began an edition of Diophantus's manuscripts, and in 1885, he and Charles Henry began an edition of one of Fermat's works. This work was made possible by access to the Bibliothèque Nationale, and so Tannery had to reduce his efforts in 1886 when he was transferred to Tonneins. Even without access to the Bibliothèque, Tannery remained hard at work, however, as he published two books composed of articles he had been writing for the Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger and for the Bulletin de sciences mathematiques. In 1888, Tannery moved back to Bordeaux, where he studied Greek astronomy and directed the tobacco factory. Two years later, he was back in Paris; he would remain near Paris until his death. Despite a heavy professional workload, he continued to be productive in his work in the history of science. His editions of Diophantus and Fermat were published, along with over 250 articles. From 1890 forward, Tannery's other major work focused on a new edition of Descartes's works and correspondence, on which he collaborated with Charles Adam, an historian of modern philosophy. Scandal arose in 1903 when the Collège de France began a search for a new professor of the history of science. Tannery was considered something of a shoo-in; he even began writing his inaugural lecture. Instead, the position went to Grégoire Wyrouboff, who concentrated on modern mathematicians instead of Tannery's classical and seventeenth-century idols. Wyrouboff was also a freethinker, an asset to the secularist Third Republic, while Tannery was Catholic. Tannery died soon thereafter, on 27 November 1904, in Pantin, just outside Paris. His wife, Marie, would survive until 1945, and she published several of his works posthumously, helping to ensure that his legacy would live on. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1904 in Heidelberg. See also *George Johnston Allman *C. A. Bretschneider *Moritz Cantor *J. G. Friedlein *James Gow *Siegmund Günther *Hermann Hankel *J. L.

It was published for the Apple II by Sir-Tech in 1984. Crypt of Medea makes use of graphics, but the game is still controlled through the use of text commands in the traditional style of interactive fiction games. The game begins with the player trapped inside Medea's crypt, and the goal is to find a way out. To do so, the player must make use of a variety of items and avoid falling victim to a number of enemies and traps. Plot After falling unconscious during a late night drive, the unnamed protagonist wakes up in an unfamiliar tomb.Reams, 1984, p. 35 This tomb is the crypt of Medea, and it is filled with hostile creatures and deadly traps. The protagonist is forced to explore the crypt in hopes of escaping. The title screen of Crypt of Medea is Medea's only appearance in the game. Very little plot is made available to the player during the course of the game. No information is given about how the player ended up in Medea's tomb, and no background information is ever given about Medea. In fact, the protagonist does not ever encounter Medea during the course of the game, and the only mention of her is through an inscription that she wrote.Inscription: MANY HAVE TRIED AND MANY HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE YOU LACK STRENGTH, YOU HAVE FAILED ME ALSO! YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF ME. . . OR YOUR LIFE! IT IS SIGNED. . .MEDEA!' (Crypt of Medea) Gameplay The game's environment is divided into a series of distinct sections. Each section is represented with a picture and a text description. Objects or creatures that the player can interact with will be visible in the picture and described in the text description. The player can move from one section to another by moving in one of the cardinal directions or occasionally through other actions (such as going up a staircase, going down a hole, or swinging across a ravine). A composition of two screenshots from the room containing Scum, one of the creatures that inhabits Medea's crypt. The top screen is the picture view, and the bottom screen is the text view. One of the primary gameplay mechanics in Crypt of Medea is the use of items. Items can be found in many locations throughout the crypt, and the player can carry a limited number of these items at any given time. Often one or more items are the key to solving a puzzle or defeating an enemy that blocks the player's progress. Since the player can only hold a few items at once, inventory management is often a crucial factor to the player's survival. Reception At the time of its release, Crypt of Medea was considered a fairly graphic and adult game due to its detailed descriptions of violent deaths. Kim Schuette, author of The Book of Adventure Games, described Crypt of Medea as \\"a humorless and gruesome game, full of blood, gore, and little else.\\"Schuette, 1984 as cited in The cover of the game even describes Crypt of Medea as \\"an adventure game for the very mature and strong of heart.\\" Computer Gaming World described Crypt of Medea as \\"an example of a mature and excellent product\\" and an \\"excellently designed game.\\" The magazine praised the game for its controls and for having a level of challenge that is enjoyable for both novice and expert players. St.Game described the game as \\"something of an Addams Family on disk. It is macabre and witty and stupid and inventive and repetitious and altogether kooky\\". The magazine criticized the game's typos and poor parser, but stated that it was \\"full of funny surprises\\", and recommended it to \\"beginning adventurers in the family\\".

Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the documentary follows Emmanuel on his journey to change the political and societal norms wrapped around disabled people in his home country of Ghana. Being that he was born with a deformed right leg, Emmanuel witnessed firsthand his whole life how disabled people were treated and viewed in the eyes of society. Children born with disabilities in Ghana are often abandoned or, in more extreme cases, killed. If they do survive, they often become poor beggars on the street. He, on the other hand, grew up in a small home with his mother and family. His father abandoned his mother when he found out that his son had a deformed leg. Emmanuel shined shoes every day for $2, refusing to let the prejudices against disabled people get to his head. One day he put in a grant request to the Challenged Athletes Foundation based in California all the way over in the United States. His request was not one for money, but rather for a bike that he would later receive to travel nearly 380 miles across the entire country of Ghana on to show those that did not support equal rights that disabled people can accomplish above and beyond what society tells them they can. Word spread fast about Emmanuel's long journey on the bike given to him by the foundation. The Challenged Athletes Foundation, who gave Emmanuel the bicycle, reached out and asked him to come to America to do their triathlon. Being the ultimate go getter, Emmanuel went along and was even given a prosthetic leg after due time. Being as selfless as he is, Emmanuel used his newly found fame to better the 2 million disabled people of Ghana. He was awarded the CAF Most Inspirational Athlete of the Year Award and Nike's Casey Martin award in America. Along with these awards he was also gifted money, and he used it all to give the people of Ghana free wheelchairs, and started the Emmanuel Education Fund. Hearing about his son's fame, Emmanuel's father returned to him to make amends. Emmanuel clarifies in the documentary that he doesn't buy the excuses his father stresses, but gifts his father with his forgiveness anyway. The documentary wraps up by showing many promising changes Emmanuel has made to Ghana and plans to make in the future.

It was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793. The species is known for its wooly body and pink and yellow coloration, which varies from cream or white to bright pink or yellow. Males have bushier antennae than females, which allow them to sense female pheromones for mating. As the common name of the species implies, the preferred host trees are maple tree. Adult females lay their yellow ovular eggs in groups of 10 to 40 on the underside of maple leaves. The emerging caterpillars, also known as the greenstriped mapleworm, mainly feed on the leaves of their host maple trees, particularly red maple, silver maple, and sugar maple. Since the caterpillars eat the entire leaf blade, in dense populations, caterpillars have been known to defoliate trees, resulting in aesthetic rather than permanent damage. However, like all other Saturniid moths, the adult moths do not eat.  Description  Rosy maple moth is the smallest of silk moths The rosy maple moth is the smallest of the silk moths; males have a wingspan of 3.2 to 4.4 centimetres (1.25-1.75 in); females of 3.8 to 5 centimetres (1.5–2 in). The species can be identified by their unique, but varying, pink and yellow coloration. They have reddish-to-pink legs and antennae, yellow bodies and hindwings, and pink forewings with a triangular yellow band across the middle.  Geographic range  The rosy maple moth lives across the eastern United States and adjacent regions of Canada. Their northernmost range includes the southern regions of Canada, including Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Their range extends south along the Atlantic coast of North America to Dade County, Florida, and extends west from eastern Texas through Minnesota.  Habitat  Sugar maple The rosy maple moth can be found in temperate deciduous forests and nearby suburban areas and urban landscapes. Their common name derives from the fact that they can primarily be found on maple trees, including red maples (Acer rubrum), sugar maples (Acer saccharum), silver maples (Acer saccharinum), and box elder maples (Acer negundo). They can also be found on oak trees, particularly turkey oaks (Quercus laevis), especially when they are found dispersed among maple trees.  Home range and territoriality  Larvae hatch and live on the same tree through their development, then pupate in the soil beneath the same tree. The larvae primarily eat the underside of leaves, therefore preferentially staying in that location of their home tree. The adults do not eat, so they can have a sizeable home range.  Behavior = Feeding  The rosy maple moths preferentially lay their eggs on maple trees, and sometimes nearby oak trees. Since the larvae remain on the same tree upon which they hatched, most larvae feed on the underside of maple leaves or oak leaves. In early instars, the larvae feed together in groups, but beginning in the third or fourth instar the caterpillars begin to feed individually. The larvae eat the entire leaf blade and are capable of consuming a few leaves each. Thus, large populations of greenstriped mapleworms are capable of defoliating trees. Luckily, this damage is mostly harmless and the leaves will grow back. Adult rosy maple moths do not feed.  Parental care  Oviposition = Female rosy maple moths lay their eggs one day after fertilization. During those 24 hours, the eggs are protected inside the body of the female. Besides this, rosy maple moths exhibit little parental care, as the female leaves after depositing her eggs. Females typically lay around 150 to 200 eggs in groups of 10 to 40 on the underside of leaves of maple trees and occasionally oak trees. Females typically only reproduce once, but in southern regions they can lay eggs up to three times. Egg laying typically occurs in the warmer months, with a peak in July, although precise timing depends on the region. In northern regions, one brood is laid between May and August. Further south, two broods are laid between April and September. In Florida, between March and October three broods are laid.Life cycle of a rosy maple moth  Social behavior  Caterpillars live and feed in groups until the fourth instar when they become solitary. Adult rosy maple moths are mostly solitary besides during mating.  Life cycle  Individual rosy maple moths typically live for about two to nine months. Between hatching and adulthood, the species undergoes five instars. For moths with longer life spans, much of this time is spent as a pupa over the winter months.  Eggs  Eggs are laid 24 hours after fertilization. The eggs are ovular and about 1.4 mm in diameter, with a thin smooth yellow shell. Eggs hatch after about ten days to two weeks. After hatching, a transparent egg shell is left behind.  Caterpillar  Greenstriped mapleworm Rosy maple moth larvae are known as greenstriped mapleworms, and they undergo five instars prior to adulthood, during which their coloration and eating behavior changes. In early instars, the pupa have relatively large black heads and pale yellow-green bodies with faint green stripes. They have two large dark-green to black tubercles on the second thoracic segment and three rows of smaller spines, or setae, on each side of their body. The larvae undergo their first molt around 6–11 days after hatching, their second molt approximately 12 days after hatching, and their third molt around 19 days post hatching. In the next instars, the black head becomes smaller relative to the diameter of the body and the longitudinal stripes darken and become reddish. In later instars, the head becomes yellow, and in the final instar, becomes bright red. By the final instar, the body is yellow green with longitudinal stripes that range from white to green to black. The two prominent horns on the second thoracic segment are accompanied by two rows of short spines found along both sides of the body. At maturity, the caterpillars reach lengths of about 2 inches. Until the fourth instar, the larvae live and feed together, but in their final two instars they are solitary.  Pupa  After about a month, full-grown caterpillars crawl to the bottom of the host tree and pupate in shallow underground chambers. The pupae are very dark, elongated, and have small spines. The pupa ends in a small forked point. The pupal stage lasts at least two weeks and up to the whole winter. If the moths pupate over winter, the majority of their lives are spent in the pupal stage. When the imago (adult) ecloses, it has small wings which it has to pump full of fluid in order to expand them and allow for flight.Rosy maple moth  Adult  Adult rosy maple moths are distinguishable by their bright pink and yellow color, although exact coloration can vary significantly. Both sexes have a wingspan of 32–55 mm. Their bodies are woolly, and typically yellow on the top and pink on the underside, but can range to cream or white. Their legs and antennae are also pink. The forewings can be yellow to white with varying amounts of pink along the edges. The alba subspecies, found in Missouri, is completely white or white with faint pink markings.  Predators  The predators of the rosy maple moth and larvae mostly consist of birds including blue jays, black- capped chickadees, and tufted titmice. The bright coloration of the wings may serve as a defense mechanism to trick predators into thinking they are poisonous and not edible.  Mating  Rosy maple moths exhibit sexual dimorphism, that is males and females have different appearances. In the case of the rosy maple moth, males have narrower and less rounded wings. Additionally, while females have simple antennae, males have bipectinate (comb-like on both sides) antennae to sense females' pheromones during mating. The moths become sexually mature at 2 to 9 months of age. Mating occurs at night, when females release pheromones to attract males. Fertilization occurs internally, and females lay their eggs 24 hours after mating. The moths are polygyandrous: females find a new male to mate with each time during breeding season when multiple broods are laid per season in warmer regions.  Thermoregulation  Adults become active in the warmer months of the year. In a study that compared D. rubicunda with Actias luna, the prevalence of the rosy maple moth was found to vary with changes in temperature, with highest counts at the highest temperature, perhaps due to the tropical origin of the subfamily Ceratocampinae. Their small size, preventing more effective body temperature control, may also contribute to their preference for warm weather. Adult moths are generally nocturnal, preferentially flying throughout the first third of the night.

The local authorities try to restore many of the ancient routes, even those used in a limited period, in the interest of tourism. Here follows an overview of the main routes of the modern-day pilgrimage. UNESCO World Heritage Listings The Routes of Northern Spain and the French Way (Camino Francés) are the ones listed in the World Heritage List by UNESCO.\\"Routes of Santiago de Compostela: Camino Francés and Routes of Northern Spain\\", UNESCO Routes of Northern Spain The Routes of Northern Spain is a network of four Christian pilgrimage routes in northern Spain. =Camino Primitivo= The Camino Primitivo splits off from the Norte south of Villaviciosa, near Oviedo, and spans 355km (this includes roughly 40km on the Camino Francés at the end). As the name suggests, this is one of the original Caminos. =Coastal Way= Rates in 1669 by Pier Maria Baldi, drawn during the pilgrimage of future Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici. The Portuguese Way (, ) begins at Lisbon or Porto in Portugal. From Porto, along the Douro River, pilgrims travel north crossing the Ave, Cávado, Lima and Minho rivers before entering Spain and then passing through Padron before arriving at Santiago. It is the second most popular way, after the French one. The route is 610 km long starting in Lisbon or 227 km long starting in Porto. From Lisbon, the starting point is Lisbon Cathedral, crossing the Thermal Hospital of Caldas da Rainha (1485) and heading to the Alcobaça Monastery (1252), which was an albergue (hostel) for medieval pilgrims who could only stay there for a single night. Using Roman roads, pilgrims headed to Coimbra and had to reach Porto before night falls, as the gates of the city closed, once in the pilgrims headed to Church of São Martinho de Cedofeita (c. 1087). There are two traditional routes from Porto, one inland (the Central Way) and the Coastal Way (Caminho da Costa). Rates is considered a central site of the Portuguese Way. The way has been used since the Middle Ages and the ancient monastery of Rates (rebuilt in 1100) gained importance due to the legend of Saint Peter of Rates. The legend holds that Saint James ordained Peter as the first bishop of Braga in the year AD 44. Peter died as a martyr while attempting to convert local pagans. Walking inside the Monastery of Rates's rustic church shows a rich legacy of Romanesque art. The temple is preserved without much interference since the Middle Ages.Rates is also the location of the first modern pilgrim hostel (Albergue) in the Portuguese way. On the way to the Rates Monastery there is the medieval Dom Zameiro Bridge. It was (re)built in 1185 for an easy cross of the Ave river by medieval pilgrims. It is part of Roman Via Veteris and known in the Middle Ages as Karraria Antiqua (the old way), as such the bridge has Roman origin. After leaving the monastery, the crossing of Cávado River was made using barges landing in Barca do Lago, which literally means \\"Lake's barge\\". The Brotherhood of Barca do Lago stated in 1635: \\"this passage is very popular and it is for more than 400 years in our peaceful possession\\". The Portuguese King Sancho II made the crossing there during a pilgrimage in 1244 and centuries later King Manuel I did the same in 1502. Currently, the crossing which replaces the barges in both the Coastal and the Coastal derivation of the central way is made through Ponte de Fão, built in 1892, heading to the Neiva Castle, currently lost, the Neiva was a Castro culture hillfort and early medieval castle. For pilgrims preferring the inland route, the crossing is made through the Medieval Bridge of Barcelos, constructed between 1325 and 1328. The Portuguese late Gothic Matriz Church of Vila do Conde built during the pilgrimage of Manuel I of Portugal in 1502. The crossing of the Lima River is made through the Eiffel bridge (1878) in the Coastal way, originally via barges. The bridge and the town of Viana do Castelo are signed by the sighting of the Monument-Temple of Santa Luzia (1904) over a hilltop. The Lantern tower of the sanctuary is where the pilgrim can see most of one's route in one of the most iconic views of Northern Portugal. Pilgrims were treated in the Old Hospital of Viana do Castelo, an hostel for pilgrims from early 15th century. For the inland route, Ponte de Lima's bridge is used. The later bridge possibly dates to the 1st century and was rebuilt in 1125. One of the most tiring parts of the Portuguese inland Way is in the Labruja hills in Ponte de Lima, which are hard to cross. In Classical antiquity, the Lima was said to have properties of memory loss due to events in an ancient battle there between the Turduli and the Celts. Strabo compared it to the mythological Lethe, the river of unmindfulness. Two ancient canoes found in Lanheses (Viana do Castelo) and the itinerary of the Loca Maritima Roman way suggest that to be the site where the Roman soldiers were fearful of the crossing during the conquest of the region in 136 BC. The Coastal Way gained prominence in the 15th century due to the growing importance of the coastal towns in the advent of the Age of Discovery. After leaving Porto, the route splits from the central way in the countryside of Vila do Conde. The town is still today crowned by the Monastery of Santa Clara (1318). The town is noted for the austere Gothic and lavish Late Gothic architecture, with the Matriz Church of Vila do Conde being built by king Manuel I of Portugal while in pilgrimage. The rising importance of Póvoa de Varzim imposed this new direction, In Póvoa de Varzim, the small Saint James Chapel (1582) in Praça da República holds a 15th century icon of Saint James found at the beach, the way follows west to the beach, heading to Esposende, Viana do Castelo and Caminha before reaching the Spanish border. A contemporary version of the Coastal Way, pushed by German pilgrims, goes through Northern Portugal continuously along the sea, using beach walkways. This version of the Coastal Way, also referred to as the Senda Litoral, is gaining importance, as the traditional route is increasingly urbanized and the new version is considered by some pilgrims to be more pleasant. Just before the crossover into Spain, there is also a 2-3 day detour from the Coastal Way called the Spiritual Detour (variante espiritual) known for solitude and beauty. In English, The Camino winds its way inland until it reaches the Spanish border at the Minho river through Valença, heading for a 108 km walk to Santiago, passing through Tui. A less-travelled Portuguese route, the Caminho Português Interior, begins at either the village of Farminhão or the adjacent city of Viseu, and continues along the Douro river valley via Lamego, Chaves, and Verín before connecting with the Via de la Plata at Ourense. Waymarking along this route, some 420 km in total, is intermittent until the Spanish border. The Coastal Way links with the French Way through the Liébana Route.\\"The Way of St. James\\", the Cantabrian film commission =Northern Way= A route marker on the Cantabrian coast. The Northern Way () (also known as the \\"Liébana Route\\") is an 817km, five-week coastal route from Basque Country at Irún, near the French border, and follows the northern coastline of Spain to Galicia where it heads inland towards Santiago joining the Camino Francés at Arzúa. This route follows the old Roman road, the Via Agrippa, for some of its way and is part of the Coastal Route (). This route was used by Christian pilgrims when Muslim domination had extended northwards and was making travel along the Camino francés dangerous. The route passes through San Sebastian, Gernika, Bilbao, and Oviedo. It is less populated, lesser known and generally more difficult hiking. Shelters are 20 to 35 kilometers apart, rather than there being hostels () or monasteries every four to ten kilometers as on the Camino Francés. =Tunnel Way= The Tunnel Way is also known as the Tunnel Route, the Basque Inland Route and the San Adrian Route. In the Early Middle Ages, when the Northern (Coastal) Way was subject to the Vikings' skirmishes and Muslim presence and forays threatened pilgrims and trade routes in the borderlands, the Tunnel Way provided a safe road north of the frontier area, i.e. Gipuzkoa and Alava. This may be the oldest and most important stretch of the Way of St. James up to its heyday in the 13th century. From the starting point in Irún, the road heads south-west up the Oria valley (Villabona, Ordizia, Zegama), reaches its highest point at the San Adrian tunnel and runs through the Alavan plains (Zalduondo, Salvatierra/Agurain, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Miranda de Ebro). Yet previous to the latter, nowadays pilgrims usually take a detour south towards Haro and on to Santo Domingo de la Calzada on account of its better provision. Camino Francés The French Way () is the most popular of the routes. It runs from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on the French side of the Pyrenees to Roncesvalles on the Spanish side before making its way through to Santiago de Compostela through the major cities of Pamplona, Logroño, Burgos and León.  In Spain and Portugal  The following routes to Santiago can be traced on the Iberian Peninsula.  Aragonese Way  The Aragonese Way () comes down from the Somport pass in the Pyrenees and makes its way down through the old kingdom of Aragon. It follows the River Aragón passing through towns such as Jaca. It then crosses into the province of Navarre to Puente La Reina where it joins the Camino Francés.  English Way  The English Way () is traditionally for pilgrims who traveled to Spain by sea and disembarked in Ferrol or A Coruña. These pilgrims then made their way to Santiago overland. It is so called because most of these pilgrims were English though some came from all points in northern Europe. Camino Mozárabe and the Via de La Plata Sometimes incorrectly known in English as the Silver Route or Way - \\"Plata\\" is a corruption of the Arabic word balath, meaning paved road. The Via de La Plata (once a Roman causeway joining Italica and Asturica Augusta) starts in Seville from where it goes north to Zamora via Zafra, Cáceres and Salamanca. It is much less frequented than the French Way or even the Northern Way - in 2013, of the 215,000 pilgrims being granted the compostela in Santiago, 4.2% traveled on the Via de la Plata, compared to 70.3% on the Camino Francés. After Zamora there are three options. The first route, or Camino Sanabrés heads west and reaches Santiago via Ourense. Another route continues north to Astorga, from where pilgrims can continue west along the Camino Francés to Santiago. A third, seldom traveled route, crosses into Portugal and passes through Bragança, rejoining the Camino Sanabrés near Ourense. The Camino Mozárabe route, from Almeria, Granada or Málaga, passes through Córdoba and later joins up with the Via de La Plata at Mérida. Camino de Madrid The Camino de Madrid goes northwards from Madrid, through Segovia and near Valladoid, joining the Camino Francés at Sahagún. Camino del Ebro The Camino del Ebro starts in Catalonia at Sant Jaume d'Enveja near Deltebre, where Saint James is traditionally supposed to have left Spain on his way home to martyrdom in Palestine, and follows the River Ebro past Tortosa and Zaragoza, joining the Camino Francés at Logroño. Camino de Santiago de Soria Sometimes known as the Camino Castellano- Aragonés, this camino leaves the Camino del Ebro at Gallur and goes past Soria to Santo Domingo de Silos, where it joins the Camino de la Lana. Camino de la Lana The Camino de la Lana (sometimes Ruta de la Lana), or wool road, leaves Alicante and heads mainly northwards for 670 km, joining the Camino Francés at Burgos. Camino de Levante The Camino de Levante starts at Valencia and crosses Castille-La Mancha, passing through towns and cities including Toledo, El Toboso, Ávila and Medina del Campo, joining the Via de la Plata at Zamora. Camino del Sureste The Camino del Sureste starts at Alicante and follows a broadly similar route as the Camino del Levante from Albacete until Medina del Campo, where the routes bifurcate, with the Sureste heading northwards to Tordesillas, joining the Via de la Plata at Benavente, while the Levante goes westwards to Toro and Zamora. Camino de Torres The Camino de Torres starts in Salamanca, goes past Ciudad Rodrigo, crosses the Portuguese border near Almeida, continues past Braga and joins the Camino Portugués at Ponte de Lima. Camino de Invierno 275 km long, this route leaves the French Way at Ponferrada and bypasses O Cebreiro, instead routing through Quiroga, Monforte de Lemos and Lalín before joining the Vía de la Plata at A Laxe. Traditionally, pilgrims used this way to avoid the snows of O Cebreiro in wintertime, from which its name derives. It was officially recognised as one of the valid routes for obtaining the Compostela in 2016. This route is unique, as it passes through all four provinces of Galicia: Ourense, Lugo, Pontevedra, and A Coruña. In France The Way of St. James is said to have originated in France, where it is called Le Chemin de St. Jacques de Compostelle. This is the reason that the Spanish themselves refer to the Way of St. James as \\"the French road\\", since most of the pilgrims they saw were French. The origin of the pilgrimage is most often cited as the Codex Calixtinus, which is decidedly a French document. Though in the Codex everyone was called upon to join the pilgrimage, there were four main starting points in the Cathedral cities of Tours, Vézelay, Le Puy-en-Velay and Arles. They are today all routes of the Grande Randonnée network.  Paris and Tours route  The Paris and Tours route () used to be the pilgrimage of choice for inhabitants of the Low Countries and those of northern and western France. As other routes are becoming overcrowded, that route is gaining favor, owing to the religious and touristic aspects of the monuments on the way. One starting point is at the Tour St Jacques in Paris and then on to Orléans-Tours or Chartres-Tours. From Tours, the route passes through Poitiers and Bordeaux, the forest at Les Landes before connecting to the Camino Francés, the national trail GR 65, near Ostabat, shortly before Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port or to the Camino de la Costa in Irún.  Vézelay route  The Vézelay route passes through Limoges and joins the GR 65 near Ostabat.  Le Puy route  Signs marking the start of the Via Podiensis The Le Puy route (, ) is traveled by pilgrims starting in or passing through Le Puy-en-Velay. It passes through Conques, Cahors and Moissac before coming to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. It is part of GR 65.  Arles Way  The Arles Way ( or Chemin d'Arles) in southern France, named after that principal cathedral city goes through Montpellier, Toulouse and Oloron-Sainte-Marie before reaching the Spanish border at Col de Somport in the high Pyrenees. It is also called the Via Tolosana, a name that follows the Latin convention of the other French routes, because it passes through Toulouse, a notable pilgrimage destination in its own right. After passing the Pyrenees it is referred to as the Aragonese Way. It is the only French route not to connect to the Camino Francés at Saint- Jean-Pied-de-Port. After taking its Aragonese name, it joins the Camino Francés at Puente la Reina.  In Belgium and the Netherlands  The Way of St. James in the Netherlands is said to have started after St. Boniface brought Christendom to Friesland and the worship of his reliquaries near Dokkum gained popularity from 800 onwards. The route did not become popular however until the 15th century, well after the Santiago Matamoros legend. There are several Cathedral towns considered official starting routes by the Dutch confraternity of St. James. Haarlem, a centuries-old starting point, has been the starting point of a modern cycling route to Santiago de Compostela since 1983, when an international workgroup of scholars researched the old route and one of them developed a set of maps. Since that time there have been other cycling routes to Santiago de Compostela published from other Dutch cities, most notably Maastricht. The Dutch and northern (Flemish) Belgians call the route the Jacobsroute. In Wallonia (southern Belgium) it is called Le Chemin de St. Jacques de Compostelle. Another Dutch long distance path, the Pelgrimspad (Pilgrims' Path), leads from Amsterdam to Visé in Belgium (about 100 km from Namur), and may have been a route for St. James pilgrims departing from Amsterdam connecting to one of the main routes at Vézelay. Another ancient route can be traced through Ghent (note the scallop on the Pilgrims hat in bottom right panel of the Ghent Altarpiece) and Amiens to connect to Paris and the Via Turonensis, one of the four main French routes. It is a mistake to assume that medieval pilgrims were only focussed on one goal. Most St. James pilgrims through the centuries stopped to visit other famous reliquaries, and many of the most popular ones in France and northern Spain are listed in the Codex. Many had both a scallop shell and a palm frond in their possession, indicating that they had been or were on their way to both Rome and Santiago de Compostela.  In Germany  The paths in Germany are collectively named \\"Wege der Jakobspilger\\". Other names that can be seen on trail markings are \\"Jakobsweg\\" and \\"Jakobspilgerweg.\\" One section of the Way of St. James runs through the German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Hesse following the course of the historic trade route, the Via Regia from Görlitz via Bautzen, Kamenz, Großenhain, Wurzen, Leipzig, Merseburg, Naumburg (Saale), Erfurt, Gotha, Eisenach and Vacha to Fulda. It has a length of 500 km. On 6 July 2003 the first section to Erfurt was opened in Königsbrück. The opening of the second section followed on 11 October 2003 in Vacha. The section along the historic \\"Via Regia\\" is also called the Ecumenical Pilgrims' Way (Ökumenischer Pilgerweg). Providing the link to Franconia, the Saxon Way of St. James on the Franconian Road (Sächsische Jakobsweg an der Frankenstraße) runs from Königsbrück via Wilsdruff to Grumbach (old roadbed until the 15th century) and from Bautzen via Bischofswerda, Dresden, Kesselsdorf, Grumbach, through the Tharandt Forest to Freiberg and on to Chemnitz and Zwickau, in order to join the Via Imperii coming from Leipzig, before continuing via Plauen, Hof and Bayreuth to Nuremberg. The signage was carried out in 2009-13. Between Wilsdruff and Grillenburg in the Tharandt Forest it runs in the same ancient route corridor as the Holy Way from Bohemia to Meißen, which is also being revived.  In Switzerland  Pilgrim's bridge to Einsiedeln Abbey between Rapperswil (SG) and Hurden (SZ), Heilig Hüsli and Seedamm to the right (December 2009) The Way of St. James is also known as Jakobsweg in Switzerland and the route in Switzerland is the Via Jacobi. Many routes originating in Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, Eastern Europe and even Italy/South Tyrol led to Switzerland and from there to France. Beginning in the early Middle Ages (9-10th century), pilgrims coming from northern and eastern Europe crossed into Switzerland at the Lake of Constance and journeyed across the country to Geneva at the French border. As they wandered through the countryside, the pilgrims passed by three traditional pilgrimage places, Einsiedeln Abbey, Flüeli Ranft and the Caves of Saint Beatus. They also traveled through historic cities and villages, including St. Gall, Lucerne, Schwyz, Interlaken, Thun, Fribourg, and Lausanne. Today the original paths have been restored and the Via Jacobi is an integral part of the European Way of St. James. In Ireland St. James's Gate in Dublin was traditionally a principal starting point for Irish pilgrims to begin their journey on the Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James). The pilgrims' passports were stamped here before setting sail, usually for A Coruña, north of Santiago. It is still possible for Irish pilgrims to get these traditional documents stamped at St James' Church, and many do, while on their way to Santiago de Compostella.

E. Bailey Turnpike is an toll road in the southwestern region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The route, opened on April 23, 1964, is a four-lane limited access highway that connects Oklahoma City to Lawton in its northern section and Lawton to Wichita Falls along its southern section, paralleling. The turnpike also includes an spur route that leads toward Norman, Oklahoma. The entire mainline runs roughly parallel to US Route 277. Since 1982, it has been signed as a part of Interstate 44, and as such uses its mileposts. Travel along the full length of the toll road costs $5.50 for a two-axle vehicle. Route description The H. E. Bailey Turnpike takes a generally south to north route from Wichita Falls to Lawton before turning northeast toward Oklahoma City. The turnpike's southern section begins at US 70, north of the Texas state line. US 277 and US 281 leave I-44 at US 70, and together run parallel to the Turnpike. The turnpike runs north-northeast for 15 miles, intersecting SH 5 along with US 277 and US 281. A toll plaza is located underneath the SH 5 overpass; loop ramps feed all entering and exiting traffic into the toll plaza. Just north of SH 5, a Service Area is located in the median of the turnpike, featuring food, fuel, and restroom amenities, as well as an Oklahoma Welcome Center. The turnpike then continues north for ten more miles until it again reaches US 277 and US 281, also intersecting SH 36. The turnpike temporarily ends at this interchange, and the two US Routes join a free ODOT-maintained I-44 through Lawton. After leaving the Lawton/Fort Sill area, US Highway 62, having joined the I-44 freeway in Lawton, along with US 277 and US 281, once again leave I-44 at an interchange north of Lawton, marking the south end of the northern section of the turnpike. The turnpike proceeds northeast, coming to an Interchange with US 277 at Elgin. A toll plaza is located near Mile 66. This plaza replaced an older facility just south of Chickasha in 2017.http://swoknews.com/business/new-toll-plaza-moves- south-chickasha The turnpike continues toward Chickasha, intersecting US 81 and US 277 at the first interchange. A second interchange again junctions US 277, along with US 62 and SH 9. North of Chickasha, a Service Area is located in the median, which provides food, fuel, and restroom services. The turnpike goes north through northern Grady County, coming to a second toll plaza at Mile 97. The turnpike then has a cloverleaf interchange with the Norman Spur and SH 4. The turnpike continues northeast for ten more miles before ending at the interchange of US-62 and US 277 north of Newcastle where the three routes continue to Oklahoma City as an urban freeway. Aside from the mainline, the turnpike also consists of a extension southwest of Newcastle also referred to as the H. E. Bailey Norman Spur. It connects I-44 and SH 4 to SH 9 and provides a shorter route to Norman when traveling from Lawton. The spur proceeds east from the mainline turnpike, and almost immediately comes to a toll plaza. Two miles east, the turnpike intersects SH 76. The Norman Spur ends at the interchange with US 62, US 277, and SH 9. Traffic coming off the spur continues straight, and is joined by SH 9 which continues the rest of the way to Norman as a divided highway. History Ideas for connecting Lawton and Oklahoma City started in 1953. The state highways between Oklahoma City and Lawton, were dangerously narrow, which included many 'cramped, death-trap' bridges. The route was not part of any federal interstate highway system plans, so only a turnpike was feasible. Oklahoma Senate Bill 454, which amended House Bill 933 that authorized creation of the Will Rogers Turnpike, allowed creation of a southwest turnpike and a proposed turnpike connecting Oklahoma City toward Wichita, Kansas, which was later constructed by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation and became Interstate 35. Both HB 933 and SB 454 were submitted as State Question 359 and 360 and passed on January 26, 1954. In July 1960, an economic feasibility study was completed for the H.E. Bailey Turnpike and in November 1961, $56 Million in bonds were issued for the turnpike's construction. The north section of the H. E. Bailey from southwest Oklahoma City to north Lawton was completed on March 1, 1964. The south section from south Lawton to the Texas border was completed on April 23, 1964. In 1982, as part of Oklahoma's 75th statehood \\"Diamond Jubilee\\" celebrations, I-44 was signed through Oklahoma City to the Red River encompassing the turnpike. On October 19, 2001, the H. E. Bailey Norman Spur connecting I-44 to State Highway 9 was opened. The route's namesake, H. E. Bailey, served as the city manager of Oklahoma City from 1941 to 1944, and later as the director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Tolls A two-axle vehicle currently pays $5.50 ($5.05 with Pikepass) to drive the full length of the Turnpike and an additional 65¢ (60¢ with Pikepass) to drive the Norman Spur. PikePass customers get free toll on the Norman Spur if they also pass through the Newcastle Mainline Toll Plaza on the same trip. Lesser tolls are also charged at some entrance ramps where Shunpiking would otherwise be possible. Full toll plazas on the H.E. Bailey Turnpike are located near the intersection with the H.E. Bailey Norman Spur, southwest of Chickasha, and under the overpass at SH-5 (Walters exit). Unattended ramp toll plazas are located at US-62 (Chickasha/Anadarko exit - eastbound exit and westbound entrance only), US-277 (Elgin/Fletcher exit - eastbound exit and westbound entrance only) on the I-44 portion of the turnpike and at SH-76 (Blanchard/Tuttle exit - westbound exit and eastbound entrance only) on the Norman Spur. Services Law enforcement along the H. E. Bailey Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop YC, a special troop assigned to the turnpike. The turnpike has two service areas with both located in the median of the highway. The Walters Service Area is located north of exit number 20. The Chickasha Service Area is located north of exit number 83. Both service areas offer food, gas, and a convenience store. Exit list=MainlineSouthern SegmentH. E.

It is part of the Joshinetsu Kogen National Park (locally known as Shigakogen), and is located in the valley of the Yokoyu-River, in the northern part of the prefecture. The name Jigokudani, meaning \\"Hell's Valley\\", is due to the steam and boiling water that bubbles out of small crevices in the frozen ground, surrounded by steep cliffs and formidably cold and hostile forests. The heavy snowfalls (snow covers the ground for four months a year), an elevation of , and being only accessible via a narrow footpath through the forest, keep it uncrowded despite being relatively well known. It is famous for its large population of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), more commonly referred to as snow monkeys, that go to the valley during the winter, foraging elsewhere in the national park during the warmer months. The monkeys descend from the steep cliffs and forest to sit in the warm waters of the onsen (hotsprings), and return to the security of the forests in the evenings.

Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay. It follows a simulator-style look into team racing of the 23rd century, specifically, the existence of Extreme-G racing. The player takes the role of one of the twelve riders, each representing one of the six teams of two, all of which vie for glory in the Championship. The game career mode starts in the slowest class, 250G, and as the player progresses through the career, they will eventually make it into the 1000G class, the fastest in the game. The sound barrier conventions from Extreme-G 2 are transferred here. 10 tracks are included, with twists, drops, and sharp turns. Extreme-G 3 handles weaponry differently, resulting in a significant change in gameplay from the first and second games. While in the first and second games, the player could pick up weapons on the track, and firing these weapons would not consume their primary weapon bar, in the third game, the player purchases weapons with money won, and firing weapons consumes a small amount of the weapon bar for each shot. Compared to the previous games, Extreme-G 3 offers fewer weapons. Reception Extreme-G 3 received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The school was established in 1961 and, as of the 2017–2018 school year, educates a student body of 1264. The current principal is Joseph Greene. History In 1959, many homes in the Farmington Hills area were being built by families with older children, creating demand for a new junior and senior high school. The Board of Education put together a proposal asking voters to approve a $6.9 million dollar bond for: The construction of a new junior-senior high school on a site at 13 Mile Road and Farmington Road, The construction of two new elementary schools, and The renovation of existing schools. The proposal was passed by voters and the final outcome of the vote was 1,618 in favor and 1,276 opposed. In January 1960, the School Board appointed Harold Humble, an assistant principal at Farmington High School, to principal of the new school. The suggested name “Farmington Northern High,” was later changed to “North Farmington High School.” It was not until the summer of 1960 that the architectural plans were approved for the new High School. As construction continued in January 1961, the School Board unanimously approved the proposed color scheme of “shades of brown and yellow.” North Farmington High School opened on September 7, 1961 but lacked many needed supplies such as chalk boards. There were 598 students from grades 7–10 who attended that first day. Students chose the name \\"Raiders\\" as their mascot but a personal identity was needed for the Raider, so the art class designed the original Raider logo that is still being used today and was named “El Cid.” As time went on, the Raider was increasingly referred to as the “Sidney Raider.” It is a school tradition for a student to anonymously dress up as Sidney, wearing the traditional NF cape, buccaneer hat, and Zorro-style mask, and attend high-profile North Farmington sports events in order to spark excitement in the crowd. In addition to its strong academic tradition, North Farmington is also noted for its strong theater, music, art, and athletic programs. It also has a high level of alumni and community involvement, with fund raising efforts leading to the construction \\"Raider Plaza\\" at the athletic field, Holland Field. In addition to its two artificial turf fields and parquet gym floor, the school also features a performing arts wing, completed in 1999, that houses the Farmington Public Schools district television station, TV-10. On September 8, 2008, the school hosted a campaign stop by Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama. He spoke to a crowd of area voters in the school's gymnasium. During the town hall-style meeting, Mr. Obama announced to the audience that the 2009 Michigan Principal of the Year award was being awarded to then North Farmington principal Richard Jones. On March 30, 2011 that the school building was renamed the \\"Richard B. Jones Academic Center\\", in honor of the outgoing principal. Around the same time, the west wing of the school was dedicated and named the \\"Dean and Sue Cobb Center for Media and the Performing Arts\\" after two long-standing instructors.

Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed the Royal Commission in 1982, and it presented its recommendations to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1984. The commission's recommendations reflect three broad themes mainly derived from neoconservative ideology. Firstly, the report suggested for Canada to foster a more flexible economy, which would be capable of adjusting to international and technological change, and it recommended greater reliance on the market mechanisms and a free trade agreement with the United States. Secondly, the commission recommended various reforms to the welfare state model and emphasized social equity and economic efficiency. Thirdly, the commission recommended the adoption of an elected Senate in order to better represent Canada's diverse regions. Most notably, the commission’s recommendations affected trade policy directly by giving greater legitimacy and momentum to the debate surrounding free trade with the United States. Mulroney began trade negotiations with the American administration shortly after the report was released. Indeed, free trade is regarded as the signature recommendation of the commission.

Originally broadcast by NBC on May 7, 1998, the episode features Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and later Rachel travelling to England to attend the wedding of Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) to his fiancée Emily (Helen Baxendale) in London. Ross and Emily's wedding vows are ruined when Ross accidentally says \\"I, Ross, take thee Rachel\\"; as the registrar asks Emily if he should continue, the episode ends on a cliffhanger until the season 5 premiere \\"The One After Ross Says Rachel\\". The episode's teleplay was written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri from a story by Michael Borkow (part one) and Jill Condon & Amy Toomin (part two). The episode's genesis came during the break between seasons three and four, when Channel 4, the British first-run broadcaster of Friends proposed an episode set in the United Kingdom to the series producers. The proposal fitted neatly with a storyline already being planned, whereby the character of Ross would be married at the end of the fourth season. The episode was filmed in March 1998 under the direction of executive producer Kevin S. Bright on locations in London, and in front of a live studio audience at The Fountain Studios. Scenes featuring Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe Buffay were filmed on the show's sets in Burbank, California, as Kudrow was too pregnant to fly to London with the rest of the cast. Kudrow gave birth to her son on the day of the episode's original airing. \\"The One with Ross's Wedding\\" features supporting roles from Tom Conti, Jennifer Saunders, Elliott Gould, Christina Pickles and Olivia Williams, and cameos by Richard Branson, Sarah, Duchess of York, Hugh Laurie and June Whitfield. The episode received good critical feedback in the U.S. on its first broadcast, and is often cited as one of the series' best episodes; however, when it aired in the United Kingdom it was poorly received, with criticism focused on the one-dimensional portrayal of Britain and the British. Plot=Part 1 The group heads off to Ross's wedding in London, leaving behind a heavily pregnant Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), who has declined the invitation because it would be too hard for her to see her ex-boyfriend get married. In London, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) go see the sights in a musical montage featuring The Clash's song \\"London Calling\\", with Joey filming everything on his camcorder. Chandler becomes embarrassed by his friend's enthusiasm, and after Joey buys a large Union Flag hat from a vendor (Richard Branson), they part company. They reunite in their hotel room and Chandler apologizes. Joey impresses him with a video recording with Sarah, Duchess of York (who plays herself), but quickly becomes homesick after a phone call from Phoebe. Emily takes Monica (Courteney Cox) and Ross to the hall where the wedding will be, but they discover it is being demolished earlier than originally scheduled. Monica later suggests Emily postpone the wedding until everything is perfect. She passes the thought on to Ross, angering him; he tells her people have flown from America to be there and that it is \\"now or never\\"; she chooses \\"never\\". Monica berates Ross for his insensitivity and Ross apologizes to Emily, showing her the ceremony can still take place in the half-demolished hall that he has tidied up. She agrees. In New York, Rachel realizes she still loves Ross, and is further taken aback that the entire group apart from Ross knew about it. Phoebe tries to help Rachel get over her feelings for Ross, but to no avail. Rachel soon decides to fly to London to tell him she loves him, ignoring Phoebe's protests. Part 2 At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but, when they discover extravagant costs, Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in- laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. On the flight from New York to London, Rachel annoys other passengers by telling them about her relationship with Ross. Eventually, one of the passengers (played by guest star Hugh Laurie) has enough of this, and calls her out on her selfishness, pointing out that while Rachel claims to love Ross, she is going to ruin the happiest day of his life, and she should accept how things are. He also says that she and Ross were definitely \\"on a break\\". Phoebe tries to contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, eventually getting through to Joey at the hotel on the morning of the wedding. Joey devises a plan with Monica and Chandler for the three of them to intercept Rachel, but he does not see Rachel arrive in the hall, as he is distracted by kissing a bridesmaid who had seduced him the night before. Rachel sees Ross and Emily kiss after he has urged their parents to stop their argument over the wedding. She realizes how happy Ross is with Emily and wishes him good luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding and is relieved that Rachel has come to her senses. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, leaving a shocked registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel. Production During the summer hiatus of 1997, the producers were contacted by Channel 4, the British first- run broadcaster of Friends, with a proposal to film an episode in London. Producer Greg Malins is quoted as saying \\"We had to come up with a storyline that would cause all the Friends to go to London [...] and that ended up being Ross getting married, because they would all have to go to his wedding\\". The episode featured numerous supporting roles from British actors. For her role as Andrea Waltham, Saunders \\"heard Joan Collins' voice in [her] head\\".Stallings, p. 126. Her Absolutely Fabulous co-star June Whitfield appeared in cameo as the housekeeper. Felicity, the bridesmaid who Joey entices, is played by Olivia Williams. Further cameos were made by Sarah Ferguson as herself, Richard Branson as the vendor who sells Joey a hat, and Hugh Laurie as the man sitting next to Rachel on the plane. Lisa Kudrow did not join the others in London as she was too heavily pregnant to fly, as was her character Phoebe. Elliott Gould inadvertently revealed to the public that Rachel was to turn up at the wedding, upsetting Marta Kauffman. Scenes not involving the main apartments were all filmed in London during the week beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, and the top of an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Walthams' hallway and the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience. The episode was a coup for Channel 4, who erected crush barriers outside their building to hold back fans when the cast arrived for a press conference (though no fans actually turned up). The broadcaster also commissioned a behind-the-scenes program from Princess Productions. Hosted by British television personality Johnny Vaughan, The One Where Johnny Makes Friends features comedic tongue-in-cheek interviews with all six main cast (Vaughan contacted Kudrow by payphone, claiming that he could not make international calls from his dressing room) and was broadcast on Channel 4 on May 6, 1998. Two brief behind-the-scenes featurettes were filmed, titled Friends Goes to London and Friends on Location in London, which were included on the DVD releases of seasons four and five. A tie-in book, Making Friends in the UK () was published by Channel 4 Books in November 1998. It was bundled into a gift pack entitled \\"The One with the Whole London Wedding\\", which featured an extended cut of the episode merged with the next episode. Ross and Emily's marriage was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale did not wish to remain in America while pregnant. The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily would not be seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written out in the next season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere. Reception In its original airing, \\"The One with Ross's Wedding\\" finished third in ratings for the week of May 4–10, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 21.2, equivalent to approximately 20.6 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on NBC that week, following Seinfeld and ER – all of which aired on the network's Thursday night Must See TV lineup. The episode aired in the Republic of Ireland on RTÉ on May 25, 1998, six days earlier than in the United Kingdom on Sky1. It also aired on Channel 4 on December 11, 1998 and was watched by 6.49 million viewers, making Friends the highest rated show on the channel for the week ending December 13, 1998. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e December 13, 1998\\", listed under Channel 4 Entertainment Weekly gives the episode an A rating, calling it a \\"near-perfect finale that finds everyone at the top of their game\\" with a \\"tantalizing cliff-hanger, and, in Chandler and Monica, a relationship that will have reverberations for seasons to come\\". The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends state there are \\"too many 'best moments' to list in detail\\", but single out Rachel describing the perfect wedding to Ross, and Sarah Ferguson's cameo (though they call Branson's \\"embarrassing\\"). Following the broadcast of the episode in the UK, The Independent was critical, saying \\"Twice the length of a normal episode, last night's offering was approximately half as funny\\" and suggested the cast were behaving out of character. David Schwimmer has expressed dissatisfaction that Ross was married again, saying it was \\"a mistake\\" and that Ross was not given \\"enough credit\\". He says that Ross's \\"taking on the world would just be shattered\\" and that he would not have risked marrying again. David Crane has said that filming in front of a different audience \\"energized the actors and writers\\". The hall where the wedding ceremony took place would inspire the location for the wedding of David and Victoria Beckham. The events of this episode are revisited in the seventh-season episode \\"The One with the Truth About London\\", in which flashbacks reveal how Monica and Chandler ended up in bed together. The hotel room set was recreated for those scenes. In 2013, TV Guide ranked the beginning of the Monica-Chandler affair as the third-greatest twist of all time.

She has released two albums – Seventeen in 2005 and Out of My Hands a repackaged compilation with new tracks in 2006. Life and career Keisha White attended Enfield County School for girls, then pursued a career in music whilst attending Susi Earnshaw Theatre School in Barnet North London, alongside Jay Asforis who found fame in S Club 8. When she was 14, White was invited to perform in front of music executives at Warner Bros. Records. She sang \\"If You Should Lose a Good Thing\\" by Aretha Franklin a cappella and the record company were so impressed that they signed her. \\"If You Should Lose a Good Thing\\" became the first song White performed live for an audience. At the age of 15 she collaborated with Paul Oakenfold and Desert Eagle Discs. She has toured countries in Africa, Europe, and the United States. White was involved with production, vocals and mastering working with Keith Harris, Theron Feemster, Phantom Boyz, Robin Miller. On 15 March 2004, at the age of 17, three years after signing her record deal, White released her debut single, \\"Watcha Gonna Do\\", following a support slot on R&B; group Mis-Teeq's tour in late 2003. She also sang the theme tune for CBBC's The Story of Tracy Beaker television series and the track was included as the B-side to her debut single. 2005–06: Seventeen After the release of \\"Watcha Gonna Do\\", White returned in 2005 with her second single, \\"Don't Care Who Knows\\". The track featured U.S. rapper Cassidy and peaked No. 29 in the UK Singles Chart. Following the release of this single, on 7 March 2005, White's debut album Seventeen was released. Her third single, \\"Don't Fool a Woman in Love\\" was released on 23 May 2005. After the limited success of both her album and third single, White went on another hiatus, following a support slot for Beverley Knight at Rochester Castle. A third single from her debut album \\"The Weakness in Me\\", a double A-side with \\"Open Like So\\" was not released. Keisha White supporting UB40 at Westonbirt Arboretum in 2006 White then returned in 2006 with a single, the choice was apparently influenced by her friend Alicia Keys. The single was a remake of Joan Armatrading's \\"The Weakness in Me\\", the originally intended third single from her debut album. The single was released on 27 February 2006, gaining strong support from UK music channels and BBC Radio 2, enabling it to become White's biggest hit to date, peaking at no. 17 in the UK Singles Chart. Because a re-packaged and re-titled version of the album Seventeen was due in 2006, her record label decided to delete the first album, making it a rarity. 2006–07: Out of My Hands On 19 June 2006, White released the second single from her second album, entitled \\"Don't Mistake Me\\", written by Absolute and Tracy Ackerman. The song peaked at No. 16 in the UK airplay chart, but reached only No. 48 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2006, the song featured in episode 5 of season 3 called \\"Oh, the Guilt!\\" of Grey's Anatomy. White's second album, Out of My Hands was released on 3 July 2006, and was half made up of tracks from Seventeen and the other half newly recorded songs. The album also included the third single from Seventeen, \\"The Weakness in Me\\". The album peaked at No. 55 in the UK Albums Chart. The third single from the album, \\"I Choose Life\\", was a version of the Celine Dion song, \\"Ain't Gonna Look the Other Way\\". This was released on 18 September 2006, reaching No. 63 in the UK chart. White is also working with ByteNight, a charity event to raise money for the NCH to help stop youth homelessness. She, along with other celebrities, has designed a pillow-case which is now on auction at the ByteNight website. White was nominated for best UK female at the 2006 MOBO Awards, but lost out to Corinne Bailey Rae. 2012–present On 31 March 2012, White performed her new single, \\"Butterflies\\". Sometime in late 2015 White featured on the song 'Africa' by the controversial Zimbabwean hip-hop artist Maskiri.

Kiselewski (1901– February 26, 1988) was an American sculptor. Biography Kiselewski was born in Browerville, Minnesota and graduated from the Minneapolis School of Art. Along with many other artists of the time, Kiselewski moved to New York City, where he studied at the National Academy of Design and at BAID. From 1922 to 1926 he worked as an assistant to Lee Lawrie. Kiselewski won the Parisian Beaux Arts competition in 1925; received the Prix de Rome in 1926-1929, and was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design, New York City, in 1936, and an Academician in 1944. He received the J. Sanford Saltus Medal in 1970 for excellence in the art of medallic sculpture. He designed various medals for the US Air Force and the US Army (including those for good conduct) in his lifetime, in addition to the American Defense Service Medal. Four sculptures by Joseph Kiselewski are in the public art collection of the Bronx, in New York City. They include his involvement, in 1932, with several other art deco era sculptors in the creation of Eight Statuary Groups, each 100\\" x 121\\" x 70\\", sculpted from Georgia pink marble, sited at the Bronx County Courthouse, 161st Street & Grand Concourse. Kiselewski's three-feet high granite Frogs, are located at P.S. 18 and Patterson Houses, on Morris Avenue, between 145th and 146th Streets. His bronze Bust of Sylvanus Thayer, 1966, is in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, Bronx Community College/CUNY, on University Avenue and West 181st Street, as is his bronze Bust of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., 1970. For the Netherlands American Cemetery Kiselwski designed the 'mourning figure\\" of a mother remembering her son. Kiselewski designed a statue of Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, which is located on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1977 and 1980, Joseph Kiselewski donated his papers, covering the period, 1923–1980, to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Included in the papers were biographical material; award and teaching certificates; files on sculpture commissions containing contracts, correspondence, financial records, sketches, printed material, notes and photographs; approximately three hundred photographs of the sculptor, his studio, and his work; 2 pencil drawings; and other items. George Gurney, a Washington, D.C. curator and art historian interviewed twenty-one sculptors in 1977-1978, one of which was Joseph Kiselewski, for an exhibition, \\"Sculpture and the Federal Triangle,\\" held at the National Museum of American Art, October 26, 1979 through January 6, 1980. While Gurney conducted most of the interviews on tape, there is only a questionnaire answered by Kiselewski, which is part of the Gurney material, also on file in the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

The medial meniscus has more of a crescent shape while the lateral meniscus is more circular. The anterior aspects of both menisci are connected by the transverse ligament. It is a common site of injury, especially if the knee is twisted.  Structure  The meniscus attaches to the tibia via coronary ligaments. Its anterior end, thin and pointed, is attached to the anterior intercondyloid fossa of the tibia, in front of the anterior cruciate ligament; Its posterior end is fixed to the posterior intercondyloid fossa of the tibia, between the attachments of the lateral meniscus and the posterior cruciate ligament. It is fused with the tibial collateral ligament which makes it far less mobile than the lateral meniscus. The points of attachment are relatively widely separated and, because the meniscus is wider posteriorly than anteriorly, the anterior crus is considerably thinner than the posterior crus. The greatest displacement of the meniscus is caused by external rotation, while internal rotation relaxes it. During rotational movements of the tibia (with the knee flexed 90 degrees), the medial meniscus remains relatively fixed while the lateral part of the lateral meniscus is displaced across the tibial condyle below.Thieme Atlas of Anatomy (2006), p 399 Function The medial meniscus separates the tibia and femur to decrease the contact area between the bones, and serves as a shock absorber reducing the peak contact force experienced. It also reduces friction between the two bones to allow smooth movement in the knee and distribute load during movement. Clinical significance=Injury Medial meniscus injury Acute injury to the medial meniscus frequently accompanies an injury to the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or MCL (medial collateral ligament). A person occasionally injures the medial meniscus without harming the ligaments. Healing of the medial meniscus is generally not possible unless the patient is very young, usually <15 years old. Damage to the outer third of the meniscus has the best healing potential because of the blood supply, but the inner two thirds of the medial meniscus has a limited blood supply and thus limited healing ability. Large tears to the meniscus may require surgical repair or removal. In terms of a meniscus tear, the doctor can categorize the injury in a plethora of ways. For example, a tear on the outer edge of the meniscus has great chance of healing. Doctors call this site the “red zone” because this outer portion of the meniscus is highly vascularized; therefore, it receives the amount of nutrients and support needed for a successful recovery. Conversely, the inner two-thirds of the meniscus are called the “white zone.” This portion of the meniscus is not highly vascularized; it receives its nourishment from only the synovial fluid via diffusion. Considering these facts, doctors consider different treatments to different kinds of tears:Platzer (2010), p 208 If the meniscus has to be removed (menisectomy) because of injury (either because it cannot heal or because the damage is too severe), the patient has an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee later in life.Torn Cartilage (Meniscus) The Meniscus Meniscus Tear - Torn Cartilage If the meniscus is removed and there is no arthritis, there are now meniscus transplant options if the patient is young and has normal alignment.http://drpetre.com/injuries/common-knee- injuries/meniscal-tear-meniscus-injury/ More chronic injury occurs with osteoarthritis, made worse by obesity and high-impact activity. The medial meniscus and the medial compartment are more commonly affected than the lateral compartment.

It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to tall and in trunk diameter with a narrowly conical crown of horizontal spreading branches. The bark is scaly and gray-brown with resin blisters. The leaves (\\"needles\\") are flattened, long and thick, spread at right angles from the shoot, and end in a point. They spread on two sides, but not flat like for example in silver fir. Usually they more or less rise up forming with the shoot a V-shape empty compartment above it. Unlike in silver fir, the leaves here are sharp and prickly, without any indentation at the top. They are bright green above and whitish-green below with 2 whitish strips, each of which is formed by 7-10 wax-covered stomatal bands. The shoots are glabrous, shiny yellow-gray when young and turning gray- brown. The cones are long by wide, yellow-brown, and slightly tapering with a bluntly rounded apex. The scale bracts are hidden under the cone scales. The seeds, long with a wedge-shaped wing long, are released after the cones disintegrate at maturity in October. Manchurian fir is sometimes, but not commonly, used as an ornamental plant.

It is one of two menisci of the knee, the other being the medial meniscus. It is nearly circular and covers a larger portion of the articular surface than the medial. It can occasionally be injured or torn by twisting the knee or applying direct force, as seen in contact sports. Structure The lateral meniscus is grooved laterally for the tendon of the popliteus, which separates it from the fibular collateral ligament. Its anterior end is attached in front of the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia, lateral to, and behind, the anterior cruciate ligament, with which it blends; the posterior end is attached behind the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia and in front of the posterior end of the medial meniscus. The anterior attachment of the lateral meniscus is twisted on itself so that its free margin looks backward and upward, its anterior end resting on a sloping shelf of bone on the front of the lateral process of the intercondyloid eminence. Close to its posterior attachment it sends off a strong fasciculus, the ligament of Wrisberg, which passes upward and medialward, to be inserted into the medial condyle of the femur, immediately behind the attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament. The lateral meniscus gives off from its anterior convex margin a fasciculus which forms the transverse ligament. Variation Occasionally a small fasciculus passes forward to be inserted into the lateral part of the anterior cruciate ligament. Clinical significance The lateral meniscus is less likely to be injured or torn than the medial meniscus. Diagnosis of lateral meniscus tear is done with McMurray's test. If a tear is detected, treatment depends on the type and size of the tear. Small tears can be treated conservatively, with rest, ice, and pain medications until the pain is under control, then exercise may be started with gradually increasing intensity, to improve range of motion and decrease swelling. More severe tears of the lateral meniscus require surgical repair or removal, which can often be done arthroscopically. Swelling and stiffness of the knee can occur when you have a torn lateral meniscus. Additional images File:Gray348.pngLeft knee joint from behind, showing interior ligaments.

He fights evil with the aid of a magical ring which grants him a variety of powers. He was created by Martin Nodell, first appearing in the comic book All-American Comics #16, published in 1940. Alan Scott was created after Nodell became inspired by the characters from Greek and Norse myths, seeking to create a popular entertainment character who fought evil with the aid of a magic ring that grants him a variety of supernatural powers. After debuting in All-American Comics, Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, Green Lantern. Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of \\"mystery men\\" or superheroes in comic books. Following World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After 12 years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC would again revisit Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were the Green Lanterns of two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Stories set on Earth-Two thereafter showed that Alan became the father to two superheroic children, the twins Obsidian and Jade, each with powers a bit like his own. When in 1985 DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, it merged the worlds of Earth-One and Earth-Two, and Alan was again reimagined as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, the magical Green Lantern of an earlier generation who coexists with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. When DC brought back its internal Multiverse concept in the 2000s, it reintroduced a new, young version of Alan on the new Earth-Two, this time as a gay man and the owner of a media conglomerate whose magical powers stem from his role as champion of the Green, an entity embodying plant life on Earth.  Publication history  The original Green Lantern was created by an American artist named Martin Nodell.Green Lantern (1940) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Retrieved on November 16, 2014. Archived from the original on November 16, 2014. Nodell mentions Richard Wagner's opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelung and the sight of a trainman's green railway lantern as his inspiration. After seeing this opera, Nodell sought to create a superhero who wielded a variety of magical powers from a magic ring, which he regularly recharged from a green lantern. Nodell wanted a colorful and interesting costume for his character, deriving from elements of Greek mythology.Nodell in As Nodell recalled in an undated, latter-day interview, All-American Comics #16 (July 1940) is the first appearance of Green Lantern. Art by Sheldon Moldoff. Nodell chose the name \\"Alan Scott\\" by flipping through New York telephone books until he got two names he liked. The character of Alan Scott made his debut in All-American Comics #16 (July 1940), fighting crime under the masked identity of \\"Green Lantern\\". He also appeared as part of the superhero team Justice Society of America in All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940). He served as the team's second chairman in #7, but departed following that issue and returned a few years later, remaining a regular character. His villains tended to be ordinary humans, but he did have a few paranormal ones, such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Green Lantern proved popular and was given his own series, Green Lantern, later that year. Most of his adventures were set in New York. In 1941, Alan Scott was paired with a sidekick named Doiby Dickles, a rotund Brooklyn taxi driver, who would appear on a regular basis until 1949. In 1948, Alan also got a canine sidekick named Streak. The dog proved so popular that he starred in his own solo side-stories. After World War II, superheroes declined in popularity. Green Lantern was cancelled in 1949 after 38 issues and All-American Comics dropped superheroes in favor of westerns. Alan Scott's final Golden Age appearance was in All-Star Comics #57 (1951). He remained out of publication for 12 years, and even after his revival he never got another solo series. In 1959, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz reinvented Green Lantern as a science fiction hero. The new Green Lantern, named Hal Jordan, was empowered by alien masters to serve as an interstellar lawman and had many adventures set in outer space. His powers were similar to Alan's but he was otherwise completely unrelated—Alan Scott never existed as far as the new stories were concerned. Hal Jordan proved popular, but readers still had an interest in the old Green Lantern. Some years later, Alan Scott reappeared as a guest star in The Flash #137 (1963). To avoid continuity conflicts with the Hal Jordan character, Alan Scott and all his old stories were written as being from a parallel universe. For most of the 1960s and 1970s, Alan Scott made guest appearances in books belonging to Silver Age characters, visiting their universe through magical or technological means. In 1976, he appeared regularly alongside his Justice Society comrades in the revived All-Star Comics and later Adventure Comics in stories set in the 1970s. In 1981, DC Comics launched All-Star Squadron, which featured Alan Scott and the Justice Society in a World War II setting. Alan Scott's redesigned costume from Earth 2 #3 (September 2012). Art by Trevor Scott and Nicola Scott. In 1986, the editors at DC Comics decided that all its characters should exist within the same setting and effected this change with the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries. Alan Scott now shared the same fictional world as Hal Jordan. DC Comics decided to write the character out of continuity in a one-shot book entitled Last Days of the Justice Society, in which he was \\"forever\\" trapped in an extra-dimensional realm. The character was brought back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Rather than update Alan Scott as a contemporary young hero as had been done with Batman and Superman, Alan Scott was instead written as a veteran of World War II with a magically prolonged lifespan. To distinguish Alan Scott from Hal Jordan, his superhero codename was for a time changed to \\"Sentinel\\" and he lost his magic ring, manifesting his powers through his glowing hands instead.Showcase '95 #1 (1995) In JSA #50 (2003) he regained his classic codename and ring, though he remained apart from Hal Jordan's Green Lantern Corps. He was a regular character in JSA and Justice Society of America. In 2011, DC Comics again rebooted their fictional properties, and their new version of Alan Scott once again exists on Earth-2, where Hal Jordan and his Green Lantern Corps do not exist. The new Alan Scott is no longer a grizzled veteran of World War II, but a fresh young superhero. He first appears in Earth 2 #3 (2012) with a completely redesigned sleek, solid green suit with no cape.  Fictional character biography = Golden and Silver Ages  Discovery = Alan Scott as Green Lantern. Art by the character's creator Martin Nodell. Thousands of years ago, a mystical \\"green flame\\" fell to Earth in ancient China as a meteor. A voice in the flame predicted that it would act three times: once to bring death, once to bring life, and once to bring power. For the first prophecy, a lamp-maker crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp. In fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege, the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame. For the second, in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient of a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern train lantern. The green flame restored his sanity and gave him a new life. For the third, by 1940, after having already fulfilled the first two-thirds of this prophecy, the lantern fashioned from the meteoric metal fell into the hands of Alan Scott, a young railroad engineer. Following a railroad bridge collapse, the flame instructs Scott in how to fashion a ring from its metal, to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopts a colorful costume of red, purple, brown, yellow, and green. He becomes a crimefighter in his first adventure, defeating the crooks who caused the accident. He also discovers his powers' weakness to wood when he is bludgeoned with a club. Alan is a founding member of the Justice Society of America, and is its second chairman. Scott uses his ring to fly, walk through solid objects by \\"moving through the fourth dimension\\", paralyze or blind people temporarily, hypnotize them, create rays of energy, melt metal as with a blowtorch, and cause dangerous objects to glow, among other things. It could also allow him and others to time travel. Occasionally, he uses it to read minds or create solid objects and force fields in the manner usually associated with fellow Green Lantern, Hal Jordan. His ring could protect him against any object made of metal, but would not protect him against any wood- or plant-based objects. During the 1940s, Green Lantern seemed to alternate between serious adventure, particularly when Solomon Grundy, his nemesis, appeared and light comedy, usually involving his sidekick, Doiby Dickles. Toward the end of his Golden Age adventures, he got a sidekick in Streak the Wonder Dog, a heroic canine in the mold of Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie. In All-American Comics #38, it's revealed his middle name is Wellington. = Justice Society of America = Green Lanterns of two worlds:The Silver Age Hal Jordan meets the Golden Age Alan Scott in Green Lantern #40 (Oct. 1965). Cover art by Gil Kane & Murphy Anderson. A part of Scott's early history is filled out with retroactive continuity. All-Star Squadron Annual #3 states that the JSA fought the villain Ian Karkull, who inadvertently imbued them with life energy stolen from an innocent victim. The energy slowed their aging, allowing Scott and several other members, as well as their spouses, to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The events of that incident also led Scott, who had failed to save the victim from whom the energy was stolen, to take a leave of absence from the JSA, explaining why the character vanished from the roster for a time. Scott was a member of the Justice Society of America in 1951 when the team was investigated by the \\"Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee,\\" a fictional organization based on the real-life House Un-American Activities Committee. They were accused of possible communist sympathies and asked to reveal their identities. The members declined the request, and many of the members retired in the 1950s. The team rebands in the 1960s with Scott as a member, though little is known of their adventures during this time, save for stories about their team-ups with the Justice League of America, the parallel world Earth-One, and cross-universe adventures Scott shares with Earth-One's Green Lantern, Hal Jordan. = Progeny = It was eventually revealed that in the late 1960s that Scott marries the woman with the dual identity Rose and Thorn. They have a pair of children who would grow up to become the superheroes Jade and Obsidian of the team Infinity, Inc..Infinity, Inc. Annual #1 In the 1980s, Scott married his reformed former nemesis, Molly Mayne, also known as The Harlequin, reconciling with his son and daughter.  Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths  The Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special (1986) one-shot tells how Adolf Hitler caused a massive wave of destructive energy to erupt over the post-Crisis Earth in 1945. Scott and the JSA, fresh from burying their Earth-Two comrades Robin and Huntress, enter into a limbo dimension in order to fight an eternally recurring Ragnarok. Green Lantern vol 3 #19 attempted to retcon Alan Scott's origin and power ring to accommodate the changes made by Crisis on Infinite Earths. In this story, Alan's ring originally belonged to a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, who was so favored by the Guardians of the Universe that they removed the yellow impurity from his ring (which the Guardians deliberately placed in all the GL rings to limit their power and could be removed at their discretion). However, Yalan Gur abused his power and interfered with the inhabitants of ancient China. The Guardians then substituted a weakness for wood that allowed the local peasants to successfully attack and mortally wound Yalan with simple wooden clubs. Yalan flew into the sky and raged against the Guardians. His body burned in the atmosphere, becoming the green metallic meteorite that ultimately became Alan Scott's lantern. Yalan's spirit also possessed the metal, promising death in his rage and life when he realized his mistakes (the first two prophecies of the green metal, which were fulfilled). When Alan received the lantern, the spirit directed Alan to create the power ring and persona of Green Lantern, complete with the ring's weakness to wood. = The Return = Through the machinations of Waverider, the JSA teammates are able to leave limbo and begin living in the post-Crisis Earth they had fought to save.(Armageddon: Inferno 1992) The mini-series is followed by Justice Society of America (1992–1993), which shows how Alan Scott adjusts to his new world. In the short-lived series, the JSA fight the newest incarnation of the Ultra-Humanite as well as Pol St. Germain and Kulak the Sorcerer. Scott reconnects with his wife and children, stating in issue #1 that Molly \\"is pretty much handling things at the company...\\" and that Jade and Obsidian \\"... are fine off doing their own thing in Hollywood. Not too interested in being super-heroes.\\" The series ends with issue #10, not with the team disbanding, but with the members gathering together at their first formal meeting after returning home. Alan follows Guy Gardner and a small group of heroes to investigate a mysterious distress from Oa, only to be defeated by Hal Jordan, who now calls himself Parallax, having been driven mad after the destruction of his home, Coast City. After the confrontation, Alan discovers that an artist, Kyle Rayner, inherits the remaining Green Lantern ring. After meeting the young hero, he informs him of the situations with Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps. During the Zero Hour event, Alan witnesses the villain Extant incapacitate and kill several of his JSA teammates. After suffering defeat by the villain, Alan gives Kyle his original ring, passing the name \\"Green Lantern\\" to him.Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #2 Alan's ring was later destroyed by Parallax. For a time, the Starheart became part of Scott's body and he adopts the name Sentinel, becoming a founding member of a new JSA. Thanks to the rejuvenative properties of the Starheart, Scott's physical body is again temporarily revitalized so that he resembles a man in his 30s or early 40s. This drives his wife Molly, who has not been affected, to sell her soul to the demon Neron in exchange for youth. Alan enters the demonic realm, with help from entities such as the Phantom Stranger and Zatanna, and, with Kyle Rayner's aid, manages to win Molly's soul back, reuniting Molly's essence with her soulless being. He has since been physically altered again so that he more closely resembles his true chronological age. He returns to using the name \\"Green Lantern\\" during the JSA's battle with Mordru. He continues to fight crime in his original costumed identity, rebuilding a ring and serving as an elder statesman to the Justice Society of America and to the superhero community in general. In Green Lantern: Rebirth, Alan and his daughter Jade, assist the surviving members of the Green Lantern Corps, Hal Jordan, who had been possessed by the ancient fear entity Parallax, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, and Kilowog, in defeating the Parallax-possessed Ganthet. Alan is increasingly physically weakened due to Parallax's failed attempts to control him as it did with Jordan, Stewart, Gardner, and Kilowog, so it decides to kill him instead. However, Jordan, with the aid of The Spectre, breaks free from Parallax' influence, and saves Alan from the fear entity. The death of Jade; art by Ivan Reis During the Rann-Thanagar War, Kyle Rayner's power ring revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Green Lantern Corps. = Infinite Crisis and 52 = During the Infinite Crisis, Scott and his daughter Jade, along with many others, travel with Donna Troy to the center of the universe to save it from Alexander Luthor, Jr.. Though they manage to succeed in saving the universe, Jade dies on this mission. A year later, Scott is still active and relatively youthful compared to his true age, but now wears an eyepatch having lost his eye in a Zeta beam transporter accident while returning from space. Though Scott loses his daughter, he tells Kyle Rayner that he still has family both through relations and close friendships, among which he counts Kyle. Week 4 of the 52 maxi-series reveals that Scott lost his left eye during a period when he and several other superheroes were declared missing approximately 11 months prior to the events of Checkmate #1. The Zeta Beam that Adam Strange had hoped to use for teleporting the heroes away from the time-space ripple caused by Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s actions was splintered by the ripple itself, mutilating the heroes in various ways.\\"52\\" Week Four In Week 5, Alan goes to the wife and daughter of Animal Man to tell them that Animal Man is missing in space. This gives Ellen Baker more hope that her husband is alive.\\"52\\" Week Five Alan Scott wearing the armor of his Earth-22 counterpart In Week 29, Alan, Wildcat, and Jay Garrick (Flash) are the only members of the JSA present on Thanksgiving. They talk about the other members of the JSA and about the new Infinity Inc., which is a new version of a team of which Alan's daughter, Jade, was a member.\\"52\\" Week Twenty-Nine After being put into a comatose state during an attack by the Gentleman Ghost, Alan envisions Jade, who tells him goodbye and grants him another portion of her green energy. His missing eye is replaced by a green glowing orb that, due to its mystical origins and connection to Jade, allows him to track astral and mystical energy forms such as ghosts. = One Year Later = During the missing year, Scott has joined Checkmate at the rank of White King, with his JSA teammate Mister Terrific as his Bishop. Scott soon finds himself in a moral conflict with Black Queen Sasha Bordeaux over the violent nature of Checkmate, particularly after Bordeaux and her team slaughter dozens of Kobra operatives during a raid on a facility. Bordeaux contends that the ends justify the means, while Scott adheres to the principle that heroes should not kill unless absolutely necessary. Bordeaux responds by suggesting that Scott resign. Concurrent with this internal conflict, Scott and the White Queen (Amanda Waller) try to keep the organization from being discontinued by political forces. After the rise of the being Gog, Alan Scott allies with the Justice Society members that oppose Gog's simplistic view of the world. However, after encountering a Justice Society from an alternate universe in which his daughter Jade is still alive, he considers asking the seemingly all powerful being to raise his daughter from the dead.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #20 Later, Sandman learns that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will no longer be able to survive without him. The rest of the JSA arrive to kill Gog by separating his head from the Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The Society members ally with Gog in an attempt to protect him until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of Gog's followers, including Magog, turn on him, causing Gog's blessing on them to be undone.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #21 The JSA are able to topple Gog and send him to the Source Wall, but Alan is unable to see his daughter.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #22 In the Final Crisis storyline, Alan led a resistance against Darkseid's forces as one of the superheroes responding to Article X. In Final Crisis #5, he is shown defending Checkmate's Switzerland HQ from the Justifiers. Though Donna Troy tries to place the Justifier helmet on him, Hawkman saves him. In the Blackest Night crossover, Alan and the rest of the JSA battle the reanimated Kal-L and Black Lantern versions of dead Justice Society members. After Jakeem Thunder is knocked out, Alan is one of the heroes who adds his powers into a \\"Black Lantern Bomb\\" designed to mimic Jakeem's Thunderbolt abilities, destroying all of the Black Lanterns in New York.Blackest Night: JSA #1–3 In the final battle of the event, his daughter Jade is resurrected by the power of white light.Blackest Night #8 = Brightest Day = In the beginning of the Brightest Day crossover event, Alan lies in the arms of Obsidian, convulsing and writhing as a green light pours from his body.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #43 His body possessed, Alan flies off with his JSA teammates in hot pursuit, eventually led the team to Germany. The JSA meet up with Batman's new Justice League and find that Jade, who had been staying on Oa since her resurrection, has returned to Earth inside a green meteor, later revealed to be the legendary Starheart that gave Alan his powers. Sebastian Faust tells the two teams that the Starheart has been gradually taking control of people on Earth for quite some time. Now that it is on Earth, it is growing more powerful and driving metahumans all over the world insane. Jade states that the Starheart captured her in space and purposely brought her to Earth to find Alan and that it is her fault that her father is now in danger. Just then, Alan awakens and his costume transforms into a suit of armor identical to the one he wears in Kingdom Come, and he then tells the assembled heroes that he intends on destroying the world.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #45 Starman is sent into space to search for Alan, and finds that Alan has constructed a massive fortress on the surface of the moon. Before Starman can warn the others, Alan appears in front of him and tears his gem, the source of his abilities, from his chest, thus rendering him powerless.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #46 The Starheart uses its influence to corrupt various metahumans with magical or elemental abilities, which creates chaos across the globe. Realizing that the heroes must defeat Alan in order to end the chaos, Batman recruits Miss Martian to get a mental lock on Starman, which, in turn, provides the Justice League with Alan's location. Batman then assembles a small strikeforce consisting of himself, Jade, Hourman, Donna Troy, Jesse Quick, and Mr. America, all of whom have a low chance of being possessed by the Starheart. Mister Miracle arrives and informs the team that Alan has most likely installed Fourth World defenses in his base and offers to use his knowledge of such technology to guide them through the fortress.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #41 When they finally find him, Jade uses her powers to restore Alan to normal.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #48 (August 2010) With his sanity restored, Alan chooses to allow the Emerald City he created on the moon to stay, and the city becomes populated by various magical creatures from throughout the DCU.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #43 After the events of the Brightest Day, Alan and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Alan's neck.Justice Society of America #44 In the subsequent story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment back when he was in infancy during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live.Justice Society of America #45 Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Alan sustained have rendered him paralyzed, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #46 Jade visits her bed-ridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could result in the deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #55 After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams to attract the attention of the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again. Later, the JSA try to take down the villain D'arken who has broken free from imprisonment beneath Monument Point and absorbed the powers of JSA members, but D'arken is too powerful. Due to this only non-superpowered and magical members fight D'arken. The JSA tells Alan that unleashing the Starheart is the only way to destroy D'arken. However, after releasing the Starheart energies, Alan's body begins to incinerate. Afterwards, the JSA attend a funeral for Alan, whom they believe to be dead.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #54 (August 2011)  DC Universe  In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Johnny Thunder finds Alan Scott's Green Lantern power battery in a steel mill. After he and Saturn Girl save Johnny Thunder from some junkies, Rorschach (Reggie Long) asks Johnny Thunder what that lantern is.Doomsday Clock #5 (May 2018). DC Comics. Later, Doctor Manhattan recalls various events in which he indirectly killed Alan Scott and thus set forth changes in the timeline. On July 16 of 1940, Alan Scott was riding on a train over a collapsing bridge, but he survived by grabbing onto the lantern. He continues his life, eventually \\"sitting at a round table wearing a mask\\" and later testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee but refusing to implicate anyone in his employ. On July 16 of 1940 again, Doctor Manhattan moves the lantern six inches out of Alan Scott's reach so that Scott dies in the train accident and leaves no family behind, as the green lantern is passed through different locations thereafter.Doomsday Clock #7 (November 2018). DC Comics. When Lois Lane finds a flash-drive among the mess while at the Daily Planet, it shows her footage of Alan Scott and the rest of the Justice Society.Doomsday Clock #8 (December 2018). DC Comics. It is revealed that Doctor Manhattan prevented Scott from becoming Green Lantern and indirectly killed him because he was curious about what the effects of changing the history of the Metaverse would have on not just itself but on Superman. As a result of Alan Scott not becoming the Green Lantern, the Justice Society of America was never formed and history was reset into the New 52 Universe/Prime-Earth.Doomsday Clock #10 (May 2019). DC Comics. In the present time during a confrontation among different factions, Doctor Manhattan becomes inspired by Superman, so he undoes the changes that he made to the timeline by moving the lantern back on July 16 of 1940, which resulted in the restoration of the timeline and therefore the return of Alan Scott alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe. Because of this, Alan Scott and the Justice Society assisted Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in fighting Black Adam's group as well as the People's Heroes from Russia, the Outsiders from Markovia, and the Doomed from India.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. A Brave New World, the first story set in the 5G continuity, details how Wonder Woman, the world's first superhero, revealed herself at the 1939 World's Fair, rescuing President Franklin D. Roosevelt from an assassination attempt. The narrator reflects that Wonder Woman's faith in humanity inspired people and provided hope in a dark time. In the final panel, the narrator is revealed to be Alan Scott, wearing his power ring.Wonder Woman #750 (March 2020). DC Comics. In the pages of \\"Dark Nights: Death Metal,\\" Alan Scott was seen with Jay Garrick, Doctor Fate, and Wildcat where they guarded the Valhalla Cemetery. When Wonder Woman, Wally West, and Swamp Thing enter, Alan Scott unleashes a Cerberus construct on them as he asks for the password. Wonder Woman states that the last person who told her it stated \\"Munkel.\\" Alan Scott calls off the construct and stated that she was close as the password was \\"Ma Hunkel.\\"Dark Nights: Death Metal #2. DC Comics.  Powers and abilities  Alan Scott wields a magical ring that can produce a variety of effects. The extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined, but three consistent traits are that it allows him to fly, that its effects are accompanied by a green light, and that it cannot directly affect anything made of wood. In Scott's first appearance, his body would glow green or be bathed in a green light whenever he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do a variety of things such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp- adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood. In later appearances, he started conjuring solid objects. These objects could be of any shape and size such as: a sword to cut a rope, chains to bind a prisoner, a parachute to slow his fall, and a disembodied fist to beat his foe. But they were always pure green in color and would vanish as soon as he stopped concentrating on them. Alan controlled these objects telekinetically. These conjured objects, later referred to as \\"constructs\\", would become the signature power of Green Lanterns in later decades. At the start of many stories, Alan charged his ring by touching it to a green lantern, which would give him 24 hours of power (regardless of how heavily he used it). Alan's ring cannot affect anything made of wood or plant matter. He can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass right through it effortlessly. Solomon Grundy, a zombie whose body is partially made from swamp matter, is highly resistant to Alan's powers. In the mid-1980s, DC merged Alan Scott and Hal Jordan into a shared setting and eliminated parallel universes from the narrative. Because these two characters were unrelated, the writers altered Alan's powers to differentiate him from Hal. Alan's constructs were now wreathed in green flame, highlighting their magical (and not technological) nature. He physically merged with his lantern, meaning he no longer needed to recharge as Hal needed to. In 1995, he lost his magical ring but learned to manifest his power through his glowing hands instead (this change was reversed in JSA #50). In the beginning, Alan's power was vaguely connected to the mystical power of the living world; \\"green, as are the plants, the growing things!\\". In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, this mystical link to the living world was firmly established, with Earth-2 Alan Scott's power source being the Green, which is also the source of Swamp Thing's abilities.  Other versions = Earth 2  Alan was reintroduced in issue 1 of Earth 2 as the young dynamic head of GBC productions on Earth 2 (a parallel world within the DC Multiverse).WRITER JAMES ROBINSON ON EARTH 2  DC ComicsJames Robinson kills in 'Earth 2' – Comics News – Digital Spy On June 1, 2012, DC announced that Scott would be reimagined as a gay man. In issue 3, Scott is revealed to have a boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash was caused by a force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is then told that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world. The flame creates a costume for him, and molds Sam's engagement ring into a power ring with which Scott can harness his power. Reborn as the Green Lantern, Scott proceeds to help the other survivors and swears vengeance for Sam.Earth-2 #3 (July 2012) This version of Green Lantern is associated with The Green, a mystical realm/entity that connects all botanical life on Earth.  Kingdom Come  Green Lantern (Alan Scott), protector of the city of New Oa in Kingdom Come. In the Kingdom Come limited series by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, Alan is the only Green Lantern on Earth. He lives in an orbital space station called New Oa from which he protects Earth from alien attacks, and has ceased to meddle in human affairs. When Superman comes out of retirement, he rejoins the Justice League to help suppress the rogue superhumans that are causing chaos throughout the world. After the crisis is resolved, he joins the United Nations as the ambassador of the sovereign nation of New Oa. Alan Scott's costume in this series was styled after the full plate armor of medieval knights. In the regular books, he has sported this armor on several occasions when he uses high amounts of power.  JSA: The Unholy Three  Another version of Alan Scott was seen briefly in JSA: The Unholy Three as a post-WW2 agent called the Lantern whose use of his power ring was invaluable to the intelligence community for its ability to discern truth from lies. The ring and Alan's hand were destroyed by a Superman gone rogue.  Green Lantern: Evil's Might  In the Elseworlds tale, Green Lantern: Evil's Might, Alan Scott is depicted as the young leader of a gang called the Bowery Greens. He steals a magical green gem similar to Kyle Rayner's ring and later steals Kyle's lantern. In a final showdown, he fatally wounds Kyle, but is absorbed into Kyle's ring.  The Golden Age  In the Elseworlds series \\"The Golden Age\\", Alan Scott finds himself under investigation from the House Un-American Activities Committee because of his refusal to turn over employees suspected of communist activities. In the final battle with Dynaman, Johnny Quick refers to him as \\"the big guy\\", implying that he may have been the most powerful hero of the era (although this is likely also a reference to Alan's large physical stature).  Superman & Batman: Generations 2  In Superman & Batman: Generations 2, an alternate version of Alan Scott is featured. This Alan Scott's ring's origin is explained as having originally been a Green Lantern ring that was lost on Earth long ago. In this storyline, the first time Alan used his ring, he was knocked out from behind by a man with a wooden club. This caused Alan to believe the ring was weak against wood, thereby causing a mental block that prevented him from truly exerting his power against wooden objects or attacks. (This was confirmed by the Guardians, who explained that this was the reason behind the weakness to yellow of the Green Lantern Corps' rings. They simply told all new Green Lanterns that their rings were powerless against yellow to establish the same mental block.)  52  In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \\"Earth-2\\". As a result of Mister Mind \\"eating\\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Two, including the Green Lantern among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Green Lantern is visually similar to Alan Scott. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. It has been revealed in Justice Society (vol. 3) #20 that the post-Crisis Earth-2 Alan Scott is dead as stated by his daughter Jade who encountered the New Earth Scott and was shocked to see the New Earth counterpart to her father still alive.  Superman: Red Son  Scott is also shown as a member of the Green Lantern Marine Corps in Superman: Red Son.Superman: Red Son #3  In other media = Television  * In the Justice League episode \\"Legends\\", a character named Green Guardsman, voiced by William Katt, is based on Alan Scott. The Green Guardsman, real name Scott Mason, was an alternate-Earth superhero and a member of the Justice Guild of America (based in Justice Society of America). Like the rest of his JGA teammates, the Guardsman was believed to be a fictional character by the residents of the mainstream Earth. The Green Guardsman wielded a power ring very similar to those used by the Green Lantern Corps, with the important exception that his ring was entirely ineffective against aluminum. Along with his fellow Justice Guild members, the Guardsman sacrificed himself to save his world, perishing along with the rest of the JGA during a war that destroyed most of their world. Along with the rest of the Justice Guild, Guardsman sacrificed himself and \\"died\\" a second time defeating Ray Thompson, who had recreated them all, in an illusion of his past world. * Alan Scott appears in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\", portrayed by Doug Pinton. He is a super hero in the 1970s and a CEO of an unnamed broadcasting company, who was arrested for fraud by the government in a mission to take down the JSA. He like the others tried to take the blame for all crimes though he and the rest were never convicted. As the law was now aware of his superhero identity, Scott retired from heroics. In present day, Clark Kent and Chloe Sullivan find old black-and-white footage of Alan (his power ring is visible on his left hand), along with his criminal record. Very little is said about him but was confirmed that he was still alive by Stargirl and hinted he had children. His power ring and lantern battery are shown, in a display case at the JSA Brownstone as well as his portrait in the JSA painting. In the television series' comic book continuation, it is revealed that Alan was not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, and got the ring and battery through unknown means. * Alan Scott appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\\", voiced by Corey Burton. * Alan Scott makes a brief non-speaking cameo in the Young Justice episode \\"Humanity\\", where he is shown in archival footage of the JSA. * While he never made an appearance, Alan Scott was alluded to in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode \\"Steam Lantern\\". In the episode, Hal Jordan travels to another dimension where a hero named Gil Broome (the eponymous Steam Lantern) was inspired by a Green Lantern who wore red and had a cape. * On CBS's The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper wears Alan Scott's original Green Lantern colors and logo, in season 11 episode 5, \\"The Collaboration Contamination\\". * Alan Scott did not appear in Legends of Tomorrow, but his son Obsidian appears as a member of the Justice Society of America. * Alan Scott appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl. He appears as a member of the Justice Society of America before the team was attacked and killed by the Injustice Society.

It broadcasts at 1000 watts at day and 910 watts at night on 1230 kHz from studios in Corning, New York. It is a talk radio station that airs local sports and a 3-hour morning local talk show with host Frank Acomb. It is simulcast with WENI-AM (formerly WCLI-AM 1450 AM). As with all talk stations operated by Waypoint Media, it is branded as The Patriot. Programming WENY carries a mostly syndicated lineup. Frankly Speaking with Frank Acomb, a local program, is heard during morning drive time. The station simulcasts local high school sports with WGMM, with Denis Sweeney on play-by-play. Though WENY shares the same \\"Patriot\\" brand as other Waypoint conservative talk stations WGGO and WSHY, it does not share the same lineup of hosts, because WWLZ, a competing station owned by Seven Mountains Media, held the rights to almost all the shows on those stations in the Elmira market for over a decade. The lineup became available to WENY in 2020 when WWLZ changed formats.\\"WWLZ Drops Talk For WMTT Simulcast\\" by Lance Venta, January 14, 2020 (RadioInsight.com) History In 1940 the Star-Gazette ended its eight year lease of Cornell University's WESG in Ithaca and consolidated all its radio operations at WENY.WENY (advertisement), Broadcasting, May 15, 1940, page 89. WENY's first license was granted on December 7, 1939\\"AM Query Results: WENY\\" (FCC.gov) as a new station operated by the Elmira Star-Gazette. It was initially assigned to 1200 kHz, with studios in the Mark Twain Hotel on Market Street in Elmira. WENY was the third Star-Gazette affiliated radio station. In the spring of 1932 the newspaper had briefly assumed control of WBGF in Glen Falls, and changed that station's call letters to WESG,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1932, page 11. (WBGF had been initially licensed in 1930 to W. Neal Parker and Herbert M. Metcalfe in Glen Falls, New York (\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1930, page 3.) and is now WAMC in Albany.) with plans to move the station to Elmira. However, a short time later the newspaper instead entered into a long-term lease with Cornell University to operate its station in Ithaca from the newspaper's studios in Elmira. At this time the Cornell station changed its call letters from WEAI to WESG\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 30, 1932, page 14. (now WHCU). The newspaper's leasing of WESG was terminated in mid-1940, and WENY became the Star-Gazette's sole radio outlet.\\"WESG Quits Elmira\\", Broadcasting, May 15, 1940, page 93. In 1941 WENY moved to 1230 kHz, as part of the reassignments made under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA),\\"List of Radio Broadcast Stations, Alphabetically by Call Letters as of March 29, 1941\\", page 56. where it remains today. Former sister station WENY-FM was launched in the 1960s. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s WENY-AM was a full service operation with an extensive air staff and local news department and by far the dominant radio station in the Elmira market. In the 1970s, as a Top 40 music station, WENY adopted the slogan \\"We're the One,\\" a play on the Orleans song \\"Still The One,\\" which was popular at the time and was used in promotions for ABC television, of which then-sister station WENY-TV 36 was an affiliate. The members of Orleans also were natives of the Elmira and Ithaca areas. The station kept playing music until the early 1990s, when it switched to talk radio. That was when it dropped Voice of the People, a long-running local talk show that ran weeknights at 6 p.m. Ted Hodge was the host of Voice of the People in the late 1970s. Longtime owner Howard Green sold the station cluster to Lilly Broadcasting in 1999. As Lilly (and its predecessor, SJL Broadcast Management) was primarily a television company at the time (it would eventually reenter radio in 2019), Lilly sold off the radio stations to White Broadcasting in 2000, which switched the AM side to an oldies format. Under a limited marketing agreement, the station was managed by Eolin Broadcasting Inc., which also owned talk radio station WCLI, WCBA-FM (adult contemporary), WCBA (adult standards) and WGMM (oldies). White sold the station to EBI in 2001, at which time the television station was separated from the radio stations. EBI moved the station to its headquarters in South Corning and switched WENY back to talk radio, simulcasting with WCLI. In 2003, EBI sold all of the stations to Route 81 Radio, based in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. When Route 81 Radio went defunct, WS Media, a shell company for William and Paige Christian (owners of TV station WYDC), bought the stations. To circumvent ownership caps, the Christians each operate some of the stations under each individual owner's name. In November 2019, Standard Media struck an agreement to buy all of the Christians' broadcast assets, including WENY.

The call letters WENY-FM had previously been assigned to another station in Elmira. It was licensed to the Elmira Star-Gazette, Incorporated, and began broadcasting November 1, 1948, on 106.9 MHz. It was a sister station to WENY, an AM station. In 1977, the station changed its call letters to WLEZ, and was playing adult contemporary music. Known as EZ-92, the station was automated for most of the broadcast day, but had a popular morning show through the 1980s hosted by Chris Faber. The station reclaimed its WENY-FM call sign on November 4, 1991. It also switched to a satellite-delivered adult contemporary format as an affiliate of the Northeast Satellite Entertainment network. Longtime owner Howard Green sold the station to White Broadcasting in 2000. Under a limited marketing agreement, the station was managed by Eolin Broadcasting Inc., which also owned talk radio station WCLI, WCBA-FM (adult contemporary), WCBA (adult standards) and WGMM (oldies). White sold the station to EBI in 2001 EBI moved the station to its headquarters in South Corning and began simulcasting airing WCBA-FM programming on WENY.

Canonical issues Buffy comics such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical.

","title":"Out of the Woodwork (Buffy comic)"},{"id":"4134532","text":"Siempre Selena () is the second posthumously released album by American singer Selena, released by EMI Latin on October 29, 1996. The album contained mostly unreleased recordings and remixes of previously released content. Songs on the album range from a 14-year old Selena on \\"Soy Amiga\\" (1986) to the shelved Don Juan DeMarco (1995) soundtrack song \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\". Siempre Selena was a result of the impact of Selena's death in March 1995, where the singer's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving requests from fans of her music. Abraham rediscovered forgotten tapes of songs Selena recorded for various projects. Following her death, Abraham expressed how he wanted to keep the singer's legacy alive and that public knowledge of Selena was very important to him. Critical reception of Siempre Selena was mixed, with varying reviews suggesting that the album was more for Selena's fan base and found no particular track on the album to be of any interest, while others favored its diversity and remastered songs. Music retailers believed that Siempre Selena would be another sellout due to the commercial success of Dreaming of You (1995), as well as strong presale copies and demands for the album by fans, and by local disc jockeys who were hyping the album. Retailers reported \\"modest\\" sales, while other stores reported that sales for the album had flattened. Manolo Gonzalez, marketing director of EMI Latin, explained to media outlets how the company intentionally did not market Siempre Selena aggressively. An Austin American-Statesman editor called corporate EMI Latin's marketing team an \\"oxymoron\\" on their marketing scheme. Despite sluggish sales, Siempre Selena debuted and peaked atop the US Billboard Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart with 10,500 units sold in its first week. It peaked at number 82 on the Billboard 200 chart. It remained at number one for two consecutive weeks on the Top Latin Albums chart and 14 consecutive weeks atop the Regional Mexican Albums chart. The lead single, \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Songs chart, while \\"Costumbres\\" peaked within the top 15. In November 2017, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has certified the album triple platinum for shipments of 300,000 units in the United States.  Background  In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of the singer's boutiques. At the time of her death the singer was working on a crossover album that would have propelled her into the American pop arena. The impact of the singer's death had a negative impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it into the mainstream market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. The crossover-planned album Dreaming of You was released posthumously in July 1995, debuting and peaking atop the United States Billboard 200 albums chart, the first majority Spanish-language recording to do so in the chart's history. The album's release started a \\"buying frenzy\\" for anything related or containing Selena among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. explained to Mario Taradell of The Odessa American that \\"there is an insatiable hunger for Selena's music out there\\". He further said how he constantly receives letters and phone calls from fans requesting the singer's music. Following his daughter's death, Abraham began going through boxes and found \\"more songs that Selena recorded that we had forgotten about.\\" He explained how he wanted to preserve Selena's legacy and that it's important to him that public consciousness of the singer remains intact. Selena's brother and principal record producer, A.B. Quintanilla explained on Biography that Selena's wishes were for her fans to \\"never forget about her\\". Since Selena's death, her family has been criticized by fans and the media for exploiting the singer and cannibalizing on her murder by releasing more music.  Music and lyrics  Siempre Selena contains mostly unreleased recordings and remixes of previously released content. The oldest song on the album, \\"Soy Amiga\\" was recorded when Selena was 14-years old. Taradell called it a \\"breezy Latin pop number.\\" and found that the singer's vocals \\"were kept intact but the music was redone to fit today's radio sound.\\" Chris Riemenschneider of the Austin American-Statesman did not approve of the remastered version of \\"Soy Amiga\\", calling it a \\"fluffy pop song\\" that lacks \\"any passion.\\" Along with \\"Soy Amiga\\", other songs on the album including, \\"Como Quisiera\\" and \\"Costumbres\\", were released prior to Selena signing a recording contract with EMI Latin in 1989. \\"Como Quisiera\\" was originally a \\"Tex Mex tune\\" and remixed into a midtempo mariachi recording, while Juan Gabriel's \\"Costumbres\\", was turned into a \\"feisty yet palatable cumbia style\\" track. Lyrically, \\"Como Quisiera\\" is about a girl who \\"deeply loves\\" a guy who broke her heart. The unreleased demo that was intended for the crossover market, \\"Only Love\\", was recorded in 1990 and was shelved. Abraham told Taradell how the song was \\"too adult contemporary and we wanted to go with something more pop.\\" Taradell called it a \\"faceless pop ballad.\\" while editors of the Orlando Sentinel called it a contemporary R&B; track about \\"whether to go on with life without the man she loves.\\" Taradell found \\"A Million to One\\" as being \\"a slightly sensuous flavor\\" due to the introduction of the saxophone on the recording. Riemenschneider found \\"Only Love\\" and \\"A Million to One\\" to be musically similar as \\"jazz-light\\" numbers that failed to convey the singer as having mainstream potential. The producers of the soundtrack of the 1995 romantic comedy-drama film Don Juan DeMarco—in which Selena played a mariachi singer—decided not to include her recordings of \\"Tú Sólo Tú\\", \\"El Toro Relajo\\", and \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\". Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said the producers who excluded the songs regretted this move following the impact of Selena's death. The latter two were included on the Dreaming of You album, while \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\" was added to the Siempre Selena set list. \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\", which is a \\"soulful mariachi song.\\" lyrically describes a woman who wants her boyfriend back, though he is with another girl. Riemenschneider called the track a \\"lazy, mournful mariachi\\" that finds Selena \\"belting her own special borderland blues, but she leaves little to cry at the end.\\" He added how \\"Selena's doubters who think she was more about image than talent\\" should listen to \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\". He wrote shock jock Howard Stern—who poke fun of the singer's death and her mourners—as one of those \\"Selena's doubters\\". Songs such as \\"No Quiero Saber\\", \\"Ya No\\", and \\"Tu Robaste Mi Corazon\\" have all been remixed. \\"Tu Robaste Mi Corazon\\", originally recorded as a duet with Emilio Navaira, was re-recorded with Pete Astudillo, former Selena y Los Dinos band member. The remix version of \\"No Quiero Saber\\" on the album was remixed in early March 1996 for the 1996 Summer Olympics Latin-themed album, Voces Unidas. It entered the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart at number 35 in the week ending May 11. It peaked at number six on the week ending June 22, 1996, while peaking at number 10 a week later on the Latin Pop Songs chart. \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\" was released as the lead single from the album in October 1996, it debuted at number 21 on the Hot Latin Songs chart and number ten on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Songs chart. It peaked at number two on the Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Songs chart in its seventh week, following the album's debut on the Top Latin Albums chart. It remained at number two on the Regional Mexican Songs chart for three consecutive weeks, and four consecutive weeks at number two on the Hot Latin Songs charts before falling. \\"Costumbres\\" was released as the final single in January 1997, debuting at number 24 on the Hot Latin Songs chart in the week ending January 25. In its second week Selena's version outperformed Banda El Recodo's version on the Hot Latin Songs chart on the week ending February 1. In the following week, \\"Costumbres\\" peaked at number 15. At the 1997 Tejano Music Awards, \\"Siempre Hace Frio\\" won the Tejano Music Award for Song of the Year, while \\"No Quiero Saber\\" won Crossover Song of the Year.  Critical reception  Mario Tarradell of The Odessa American called the album \\"Selena's musical scrapbook.\\" He favored its diversity, calling it \\"more impressive than most posthumous repackingings\\" essentially for having previously unreleased tracks. He believed it was \\"timed to set up the media blitz\\" on the then- upcoming soundtrack to the Selena biopic. The Desert Suns Fred Shuster panned the album as \\"second-rate material at best.\\" He called the ballads on the album \\"dreary\\" and found the album to be generated towards \\"fans awaiting the Selena movie.\\" Shuster noted that if the listener has \\"a weakness to slow love songs [then] forget it.\\" Because of the new mixes and unreleased content, Natalia Pignato and Umatilla High of the Orlando Sentinel reported that they \\"love this CD\\" and that it displays \\"the bittersweet success of unfulfilled promise.\\" In a poll conducted by News-Press in January 1997, DJs were asked to pick their top ten albums they would bring on a deserted island, Siempre Selena was among those chosen. AllMusic called Siempre Selena a \\"posthumous collection of rarities and lesser-known songs.\\" The website found the album to be \\"of interest to dedicated fans\\" and noted that there \\"are a few worthwhile items\\" throughout the recording. Ramiro Burr wrote in The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music (1999), that Siempre Selena contained \\"vocal tracks [that] were lifted and combined with different instrumental tracks\\". John Lannert of Billboard magazine called the album \\"a collection of previously unreleased English- and Spanish-language tracks\\" with what he said to be \\"sonically touched up early Latino numbers\\". Paul Verna, also from Billboard, called the recording as \\"slickly packaged\\" and a \\"so-so grab bag [that contains] romantic ballads\\" that he believed \\"is sure to appeal to [Selena's fan base] vast and loyal legion of fans\\". He found that Selena's fan base has \\"not grown weary of slow-paced love songs [such as] \\"Como Quisiera\\" and \\"Tu Robaste Mi Corazon.\\" Riemenschneider found the album to \\"[offer] a wide and impressive range of mostly unheard music from Selena's too short career.\\" He opined that Siempre Selena \\"proves [the singer] was the queen of her domain.\\"  Commercial performance  On October 19, 1996, it was revealed that Siempre Selena would be commercially available on October 29. Local music shops reported that interest in the album reached far back as a few weeks before the album was released. Local Tejano disc jockeys further hyped the craze predicting that the album would be \\"wildly popular\\" because of Selena's fans. Presale copies and interest in the album gave music retailers high hopes for the recording, believing it would be a sellout. Roughly 500 people had pre-screened the album at Hastings Books in Midland, Texas, the night before it went on sale. Music retailers were flabbergasted that sales for the album had flattened, though reported that sales were \\"modest\\". According to South Texas music retailers, sales for the album were considerably lower in comparison to Dreaming of You. All That Music in El Paso reportedly was \\"busy [in] filling the demand for [the album]\\", while other stores in the same area reported that \\"sales were slow\\". The album wasn't selling much but \\"a handful of copies\\" at a Blockbuster Music store in San Antonio. Local businesses predicted that sales would eventually pick up towards Christmas. Marketing director of EMI Latin, Manolo Gonzalez expressed how the company intentionally went \\"low-key\\" in marketing Siempre Selena in comparison to Dreaming of You. Gonzalez said how he wanted to be \\"very conservative with this album\\" and that EMI Latin had shipped 400,000 units throughout the United States. Riemenschneider called EMI Latin and the singer's family an \\"oxymoron\\" for their marketing scheme, or rather lack thereof of Siempre Selena. Riemenschneider believed their reasoning behind the insignificant promotion to be an avoidance of \\"Selena overkill\\" with the soundtrack and biopic that were due in a few months. He found their move in having little promotion to be a \\"mistake\\", calling Siempre Selena the one \\"Selena's caretakers should have promoted [following her death]\\". The album became a sleeper hit, debuting atop the US Billboard Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart with 10,500 units sold in the week ending November 23, 1996. On the Billboard 200, Siempre Selena debuted and peaked at number 82. The album also helped increased sales to Selena's other works, including Dreaming of You and Amor Prohibido (1994). After two weeks at number one, Siempre Selena was displaced by Julio Iglesias' Tango album in the week ending December 7. Siempre Selena finished 1996 as the 44th best-selling Latin album of the year, her Dreaming of You album remained that year's best-selling record. After 14 consecutive weeks at number one on the Regional Mexican Albums chart, Siempre Selena was dethroned by Grupo Limite's Partiendome el Alma. On its 19th week, the album regain the number one position on the Regional Mexican Albums chart on the week ending March 29, 1997, following the release of the Selena soundtrack. During the second anniversary of the singer's death on March 31, sales of Siempre Selena jumped 48% remaining atop the Regional Mexican Albums chart and climbing the Top Latin Albums chart at number three, a position higher from the previous week. The album remained at number one for three additional weeks before it fell from the top spot on the week ending May 10. It was subsequently nominated for Female Album of the Year at the 1997 Billboard Latin Music Awards. In its quarterly recap of the top selling Latin albums of 1997, Siempre Selena ranked third behind Enrique and Julio Iglesias' albums, respectively. The recording finished 1997 as the fourth best-selling Latin album in the United States, while it finished second on the Regional Mexican Albums year-end list. In December 2002, the RIAA certified Siempre Selena double platinum for shipments of 200,000 units; her 10th certified album. They re-certified the recording triple platinum (180,000 album-equivalent units sold) in November 2017. Track listing Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from the liner notes of Siempre Selena.

Story The album's story differs slightly than the version told in \\"It's Sleazy\\" and on tour. The first three tracks on the album do not follow one particular story, and focus on Gwar's generally decadent ways. The fourth, \\"A Short History of the End of the World (Part VII (The Final Chapter (abbr.)))\\", begins (though an instrumental, it is explained that it refers to Gwar fighting the Master - the incident that led to their exile) the story, which continues through the title track. This story chronicles Gwar's relationship with their Master, and the aftermath of their defiance. While Gwar was exiled to Earth, mystic Scumdog Scroda Moon went to search for them, only to be stranded on the moon with a tablet (that he himself carved, according to the movie and concerts) that supposedly chronicles all of time's events from the beginning to the end. After landing on Earth, Gwar somehow gets a hold of the tablet, and breaks it into pieces, which are promptly stolen (the album does not go into any more detail beyond this) and must be returned, else the Master would come to destroy Gwar. Moon, dismissed as a crackpot, summons his inter-dimensional \\"portal potty\\" to assist them in their search - to which Gwar agree, on the condition that he smoke crack and drink with them. After his initiation, and combat with various creatures holding the pieces, Scroda's limbs are separated from his body and he dies, only to be revived and improved by Slymenstra Hymen. The mock country tune \\"The Master Has a Butt\\" deals with the Master, and Gwar's final showdown. The title track concludes the story, with Gwar emerging victorious. The last five tracks have nothing to do with the story, and deal with specific instances of Gwar's decadence (as do the first three). Scroda Moon is not mentioned again. Overview The band once again offers the funny (\\"Fishfuck\\") the gross (\\"Babyraper\\"), and the weird (\\"Penile Drip\\"). Mike Derks lends his vocals to the almost sensitive punk ballad, \\"Mary Anne\\". This album is mostly a collection of gruesomely corny jokes (\\"Fuckin' An Animal\\" and \\"Nitro Burning Funny Bong\\"), and contains significantly less brutality and heart than their previous works. \\"A Short History of the End of the World (Part VII(The Final Chapter(abbr.)))\\" is the first true Gwar instrumental (the title track from America Must Be Destroyed is a collection of samples over an instrumental track, and \\"Surf of Syn\\" on RagNaRok has Cardinal Syn's voice in the background), and showcases the musical capabilities of the band collective. The lyrical content of We Kill Everything is in response to angry fans' complaints about the disgusting lyrics on Carnival of Chaos (or lack thereof). It is also the final Gwar album featuring Michael Bishop, who returned for a few months to replace Casey Orr as Beefcake the Mighty, Hunter Jackson (who would stay with the group until the end of 2000), Danielle Stampe (who toured until 2002), and Dave Musel on keyboards and samples. Bishop also brought along Tim Harriss, both of Kepone, to play lead guitar as Flattus Maximus. We Kill Everything is also the last album in the \\"Scumdogs\\" storyline (though \\"The Song of Words\\" on Violence Has Arrived and \\"Gwarnography\\" on Lust in Space make reference to it). Some of the songs are themselves as old as Scumdogs of the Universe, and at least three are remakes of older songs (\\"A Short History of the End of the World\\" being a remake of the \\"Cardinal Syn Theme\\" from 1989, and \\"Escape from the Mooselodge\\", a remake of \\"The Needle,\\" which featured BalSac the Jaws of Death on vocals for the first time with Gwar; the former can be heard in the video \\"It's Sleazy,\\" and the latter on Slaves Going Single); \\"Tune from Da Moon\\" is a remake of the Death Piggy song \\"Minute 2 Live\\", with new lyrics). The title track was tied as one of the two longest songs written by the band (Carnival of Chaos' \\"Sammy,\\" at 6:57 being the other) until the band released \\"War On GWAR\\" (7:21) on 2017's The Blood of Gods. This is the first Gwar album not to feature Beefcake the Mighty on lead vocals since 1988, and Violence Has Arrived would continue that trend. \\"Jiggle the Handle\\" is the only song to feature Beefcake, as well as every other vocalist on the album, save one - Balsac the Jaws of Death. It also has the distinction of being the Gwar song with the most vocalists actually singing - five (Scroda Moon, Portal Potty, Oderus, Beefcake and Slymenstra). It is tied with RagNaRok for having the most vocalists (six - Jackson, Brockie, Stampe, Derks, Bishop and Bob Gorman). There are eight distinct characters on the album: the six aforementioned, a narrator on \\"Escape from the Mooselodge,\\" voiced by Dave Brockie (the song features him as the narrator and as Oderus), and former Gwar guitarist Cornelius Carnage (played by Greg Ottinger, though he originally played Stephen Sphincter) on \\"Jagermonsta\\". We Kill Everything is the only other Gwar album to have been censored (the first was 1994's This Toilet Earth). The profanities are changed to various noises, and the titles \\"Fishfuck\\" and \\"Fuckin' An Animal\\" were omitted from the back cover. There also exists a Canadian release that too is censored on the back of the album, but is completely uncensored in the lyrics. There is another version that says \\"Censored Version\\" on the disc, yet actually has the back cover and the CD both fully uncensored. Videos Like many of Gwar's albums, We Kill Everything spawned a movie: 2001's It's Sleazy. Featured in this film is one of two music videos for the album: \\"Nitro Burnin' Funny Bong.\\" In the 2002 \\"Ultimate Video Gwarchive\\" music video collection, Brockie states in the commentary for this video his disdain for this song, and most of the output from the time period of 1997-2000. Several parts of the song (including the entire second verse) are omitted from the video - in the \\"Ultimate Video Gwarchive\\" commentary, Mike Derks states that an entire reel of footage is missing (a reel which, presumably, contains the second verse). The second video, \\"Fuckin' An Animal,\\" was recorded well before \\"It's Sleazy,\\" and was not in the movie. It is available, albeit censored, in the \\"Ultimate Video Gwarchive.\\" It marks the first appearance of Zach Blair as Flattus Maximus, as well as the final appearance of Flattus' tail. Band dismissal The members of Gwar seldom discuss We Kill Everything in interviews. A news post on their website reads \\"...and the world breathed a collective sigh of relief that we hadn’t put out another “We Kill Everything”, no matter how much they might have enjoyed having sex with animals!\\", suggesting their dislike for the album. Since the Gwarmageddon 1999 tour, only \\"Babyraper\\" has remained a constant in their setlist, though their wrestling tours used \\"A Short History...\\" during the second match of the night. This could be due either due to their dislike of the album, or the fact that because most of the songs deal with a specific concept or have a former member, they are unable to be played (though in soundcheck before their concerts, they do play \\"Short History of the End of the World\\"). Brockie (Oderus Urungus) particularly disliked the song \\"Nitro-Burnin' Funny Bong,\\" which he described as \\"extremely annoying,\\" along with the entire \\"It's Sleazy\\" video. However, Brockie, Derks and Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) played \\"Nitro-Burnin' Funny Bong\\" as the Dave Brockie eXperience, along with other Gwar songs (including \\"Fishfuck;\\" another We Kill Everything song that the band no longer plays live). Also, on Gwar's 2006 DVD, titled \\"Blood Bath and Beyond,\\" Oderus Urungus and Sleazy P. Martini describe Scroda Moon as \\"the stupidest Gwar character.\\" When it was active, Gwar's message board made it explicitly clear NOT to make mention of We Kill Everything, stating that those who did would be banned from the forum. However, as seen on a recent post from their website detailing the latest \\"GWAR-BQ\\" and the 30th Anniversary of the band, lead guitarist Brent Purgason did hint at the album title openly on its home page; stating that \\"I have yet to grasp this concept of the internet and the spouting of self-important speeches by people in social media; the INTERNET MUST DIE, so GWAR will KILL IT!. Management tells me the internet is not a person that can be fought and killed, but they don’t know the true power of a Scumdog. WE KILL EVERYTHING!” It has been hinted by the Gwar members from around this time (including Danielle Stampe) that this is the band's least successful album, both in record sales and on tour.

It featured a roundtable discussion among four sports media personalities, with one regular host and three rotating guests. The show began in 1988, patterned to some extent after the Chicago-based syndicated show called Sportswriters on TV. The show was originally broadcast from a studio in Manhattan,http://www.espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2008_10_oct/20081002_TheSportsReporters20thAnniversarySunday.htm and from 1999 to 2010 it was recorded at the ESPN Zone at Times Square in Manhattan before it closed. It then moved to Bristol, Connecticut at the main ESPN studios, where it stayed until the end of its run. On January 23, 2017, ESPN announced its planned cancellation, following the death of host John Saunders. The final episode aired May 7, 2017. The show would return in the form of a podcast in September 2017. Hosts and panelists The Sports Reporters first aired in 1988 and was originally hosted by Gary Thorne, who was replaced by Dick Schaap later that year. Following Schaap's death in 2001, he was replaced by John Saunders, who hosted it until his own death in 2016. The first year featured four rotating panelists, but afterwards there were three rotating panel members. Regular panelists included Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News, John Feinstein of The Washington Post, Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press, Michael Wilbon also from the Washington Post, Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe, William C. Rhoden of The New York Times, Ralph Wiley of Sports Illustrated and Stephen A. Smith of ESPN. Former panelists included Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports 1, Christine Brennan of USA Today, Tony Kornheiser of The Washington Post, Mike Downey of the Los Angeles Times, Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times and Sports Illustrated, Bill Conlin of the Philadelphia Daily News. and Bryan Burwell of the St. Louis Post Dispatch. As the show was based in New York City and then Bristol, Connecticut, the panelists were usually from the northeastern portion of the United States. For a long time there were no women serving as regular panelists on the show, but in celebration of Title IX one show in 2005 included three female sports journalists. In the show's later years, Selena Roberts of The New York Times and ESPN's Jemele Hill had made regular appearances on the show. The August 28, 2016 episode of the show made history with an all female edition of The Sports Reporters, with Hill as the moderator and fellow ESPN reporters Sarah Spain, Kate Fagan, and Jane McManus on the panel. When Saunders was on assignment or unable to host due to illness, Lupica was usually the designated substitute host and became the permanent host after the death of Saunders in August 2016 until the final episode in May 2017. Dick's son Jeremy Schaap also guest-hosted on occasion. September 16, 2001 The show was expanded to an hour to cover the sports perspective from the September 11th attacks. It also proved to be Dick Schaap's last show as he underwent hip replacement surgery and later died from complications. In fact, he delayed the surgery in order to be on that show. November 15, 2015 The show covered the sports perspective from the November 2015 Paris attacks and how the attacks had an impact in the security system in sports facilities. Death of Saunders Host John Saunders died unexpectedly on August 10, 2016 at the age of 61. The August 14 episode, hosted by Mike Lupica, featured tributes to Saunders by the panelists. Conclusion After nearly 30 years on ESPN, the final episode of The Sports Reporters aired on May 7, 2017 with Lupica hosting, and Ryan, Rhoden, and Albom as the panelists. Podcast On September 8, 2017, The Sports Reporters relaunched as a bi-weekly podcast co-hosted by Albom and Lupica with a rotating cast of the top sports writers in the business, including former panelists from the original ESPN program.

Évrard Titon du Tillet (January 1677 – 26 December 1762) is best known for his important biographical chronicle, Le Parnasse françois, composed of brief anecdotal vite of famous French poets and musicians of his time, under the reign of Louis XIV and the Régence.  Biography  Of Scottish origin, Évrard Titon du Tillet was the son of Maximilien Titon de Villegenon, seigneur d'Ognon,The seigneurie of Ognon, near Senlis in Picardy, had been purchased by the elder Titon about 1670 (Caix de Saint-Amour). a secretary of the King and general manager of the armories under Louis XIV. He studied law before his father obliged him to embrace a military career. He was already a \\"captain of dragoons\\" at the age of twenty, when unfortunately for him, the long-awaited peace prevented him from advancing his career. He then purchased the sinecure of maître d'hôtel to the thirteen-year-old duchess of Burgundy, the future mother of Louis XV. Alas, in 1712, the Dauphine died of measles, and Titon du Tillet was unemployed for the second time. He was, however, soon named a provincial commissioner of war. Titon du Tillet had the privilege of receiving the celebrities of his time, and from 1708 he was at work on an imposing project: to create a garden surrounding a monument, \\"the French Parnassus\\" (Le Parnasse françois), celebrating the glory of French poets and musicians under the reign of Louis XIV. He worked with the sculptor Louis Garnier, a pupil of François Girardon, to produce a model of the monument. A maquette in bronze for the project was completed in 1718.It is conserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale. He also ordered a drawing by the painter Nicolas de Poilly, which was presented to Louis XV in 1723. The monument was to represent Mount Parnassus, ornamented with laurels and myrtle, with Louis XIV in the figure of Apollo at the summit, playing the lyre. On a slightly lower level the three Graces were represented with the features of Mmes des Houlières, de La Suze and de Scudéry. Lower down, surrounding the mountain, Pierre Corneille occupied the principal place, surrounded by Molière, Racine, Racan and Lully carrying medallions of Quinault, Segrais, La Fontaine, Boileau and Chapelle, the nine male Muses of the grand siècle. Unluckily, Titon du Tillet could not stop there: scattered among the bronze trees were to be seen further medallions of distinctly secondary figures, now slightly passé as musical taste had shifted towards the galante, choices that elicited from Voltaire the epigram :Dépêchez-vous, monsieur Titon, :Enrichissez votre Hélicon ; :Placez-y sur un piédestal :Saint-Didier, Danchet et Nadal ; :Qu'on voie armés d'un même archet :Saint-Didier, Nadal et Danchet, :Et couverts du même laurier :Danchet, Nadal et Saint-Didier.\\"Hasten, Monsieur Titon, enrich your Helicon: place upon a pedestal, Saint-Didier, Danchet and Nadal, seen armed with a single violin bow, Saint-Didier, Nadal and Danchet, and crowned with a single laurel wreath, Danchet, Nadal and Saint-Didier.\\" The expected expenditure, estimated at nearly two million livres, forced him to terminate a project that had something to it of the character of a folly. Titon du Tillet then decided to carry the project out to some extent in a virtual form: he published in 1727, \\"a Description of the Parnasse François\\" followed by \\"an alphabetical List of the Poets and Musicians gathered on this monument\\". Description du Parnasse françois, exécuté en bronze, suivie d'une liste alphabétique des Poètes et des Musiciens rassemblés sur ce monument. In 1732, he published a second edition and increased the notes on the lives of the poets and musicians. Two further supplements were published in 1743 and 1755. This collection constitutes an invaluable source of biographical information for the mysterious Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, Marin Marais, Louis Couperin, Michel Richard Delalande, Nicolas Bernier and other celebrated poets and musicians. Ascent of the Montgolfière from the garden of the Folie Titon, Montreuil: contemporary engraving A confirmed bachelor, Titon du Tillet was a cordial man always surrounded by many friends (some say that he was obstinate); his interesting conversation provided numerous anecdotes. In spring 1749, he withdrew to Montreuil, then on the outskirts of Paris, to a beautiful little hôtel, the Folie Titon,After his death, the Folie Titon was sold in 1765; henceforth it housed the royal wallpaper factory that was directed by Jean-Baptiste Réveillon; from the still-manicured gardens of the Folie, on 19 October 1783, the first hot-air balloon carrying human passengers ascended. On 28 April 1789, a riot of the workers of Réveillon burned the Folie; they were savagely repressed, in an opening episode of the French Revolution. Today plaques mark the site. which, after his purchase in 1751 of the adjoining plot from the vicomte d’Argentière, captain of the guards, he was able to surround by a large park, with Paris laid out below his garden doors. The diarist Edmond Jean François Barbier, himself a lawyer attached to the Parlement de Paris, noted disapprovingly that Titon du Tillet lived in public debauchery with girls at the dinner table in a manner not \\"appropriate to a magistrate\\". A passionate lover of arts and letters, Titon du Tillet supported ballets and plays. He constructed a theatre in his house where a number of performances were put on, introducing in 1760 Demoiselle Leclair, who went on to a dance career at the Comédie-Italienne, and in 1762 Marmontel's play Annette et Lubin, which attracted a considerable crowd. Titon du Tillet died of a cold the day after Christmas, 1762, in Paris, aged 85. Notes Work  *Évrard Titon du Tillet.

The earliest bungalow built by the British in 1900 is also named after the village although it is about to the south along the south branch of the canal. There are two mosques and Imam Bargah and people live a simple life. There is primary school for both boys and girls.

The Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne is a Renaissance palace in Rome, Italy. The palace was designed by Baldassarre Peruzzi in 1532-1536 on a site of three contiguous palaces owned by the old Roman Massimo family and built after arson destroyed the earlier structures during the Sack of Rome (1527). In addition the curved facade was dictated by foundations built upon the stands for the stadium (odeon) of the emperor Domitian. It fronts the now-busy Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a few hundred yards from the front of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle. The entrance is characterized by a central portico with six Doric columns, paired and single. Inside there are two courtyards, of which the first one has a portico with Doric columns as a basement for a rich loggia, which is also made of Doric columns. The column decorations gave the name to the palace, alle Colonne. The facade is renowned as one of the most masterful of its time, combining both elegance with stern rustication. The recessed entrance portico differs from typical palazzo models such as exemplified by the Florentine Palazzo Medici. In addition, there is a variation of size of windows for different levels, and the decorative frames of the windows of the third floor. Unlike the Palazzo Medici, there is no academic adherence to superimposition of orders, depending on the floor. On the opposite facade of this palace, opening onto the Piazzetta dei Massimo, the palace connects with the frescoed facade of the conjoined annex, the Palazzetto Massimi (or Palazzetto Istoriato). For many centuries, this used to be the central post office of Rome, a Massimo family perquisite. To the left of the palace is the Palazzo di Pirro, built by a pupil of Antonio da Sangallo. The interior ceilings and vestibules are elaborately ornamented with rosettes and coffered roofs. The entrance ceiling is decorated with a fresco by Daniele da Volterra, who represented scenes from the Life of Fabio Massimo, the supposed Roman founder of the Massimo family. The chapel on the second floor was a room where the 14-year-old Paolo Massimo, son of Fabrizio Massimo, was recalled briefly to life by Saint Philip Neri on March 16, 1583. The interior of the palace is open to the public annually only on that day. Other notable events in the palace of the 16th century including various intrafamilial murders.

Directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Errol Flynn, the film was made by Warner Bros. immediately after the raid. Plot Errol Flynn playing Captain Nelson, the group's heroic leader. A group of United States Army paratroopers led by Captain Nelson are dropped into Burma to locate and destroy a camouflaged Japanese Army radar station that is detecting Allied aircraft flying into China. For their mission, they are assigned Gurkha guides, a Chinese Army Captain and an older war correspondent whose character is used to explain various procedures to the audience. The mission is an overwhelming success as the 36-man team quickly take out the station and its personnel. But when the airborne troops arrive at an old airstrip to be taken back to their base, they find the Japanese waiting for them at their rendezvous site. Captain Nelson makes the hard decision to call off the rescue planes, and hike out on foot. To reduce the likelihood of detection, the group then splits up into two smaller units to meet up at a deserted Burmese village. But when Nelson arrives at the meeting place, he finds that the other team had been captured, tortured and mutilated by the Japanese. Only Lt. Jacobs survives, and he too dies after telling Nelson what had happened. The surviving soldiers are then attacked and are forced again to retreat into the jungle. The men must then cross the swamps in their attempt to make it back to safety through enemy-occupied jungle. Fighting an almost constant rearguard action, Nelson's paratroopers also succeed as decoys leading Japanese troops away from the site of the British 1944 aerial invasion of Burma. CastProduction=Development Jerry Wald later claimed he got the idea for doing a film set in Burma in Christmas 1943, feeling this particular theatre of the war would soon be active, and hoping the movie could be made and released before then. Lester Cole says the original story was written by Alvah Bessie who wrote a \\"dozen or so\\" pages before being pulled off the project by Wald and assigned to something else.Cole, p. 206 The job of writing the story and screenplay was given to Cole and a new writer for film, Ranald MacDougall. MacDougall had been a creator and co-writer of the CBS radio series The Man Behind the Gun that was awarded a 1942 Peabody Award.Dunning 1998, pp. 430–431. He had been contracted to Warner Brothers, with this his second film after uncredited work on Pride of the Marines. \\"Ranald was a pleasure to work with,\\" wrote Cole later, \\"bright, eager to learn, a facile writer of dialogue: we got along famously.\\"Cole, p. 207 In his memoirs, Cole claims Wald was inspired by a book about an attempted British invasion of Burma called Merrill's Marauders and he decided to change the troops from being British to American.Cole, p. 207 However, Merrill's Marauders was an American unit. The film was announced in January 1944, with Wald and Walsh attached. Errol Flynn was already being discussed as the star. Franchot Tone was mentioned as a possible co-star.

The New York Times wrote: \\"This is without question one of the best war films yet made in Hollywood. There are no phony heroics by Errol Flynn or any of the other members of a uniformly excellent cast. These boys conduct themselves like real soldiers and even the newspaper correspondent is a credit to the craft. The Warners have erred only in the film's excessive length. It runs approximately two hours and twenty minutes, or roughly thirty minutes more than appears to be absolutely necessary.\\" Variety noted: \\"The film has considerable movement, particularly in the early reels and the tactics of the paratroopers are authentic in their painstaking detail. However, while the scripters have in the main achieved their purpose of heightening the action, there are scenes in the final reels that could have been edited more closely.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote: \\"Very good! It ranks with the best of the war melodramas yet produced ... While the action holds one's interest all the way through, a cut of ten to fifteen minutes in the running time would not affect its dramatic punch.\\" Film Daily wrote: \\"The picture impresses with its air of authenticity and the vivid realism that has gone into the telling of its story, and it possesses almost unremitting action crowded with the starkest of drama ... The primary fault of the film is that it is dragged out beyond all reason. There is much repetitious material that could be cut out to the improvement of the film.\\" Filmink magazine called the film \\"serious, hard and lacks any sort of female interest – the enemy are ruthless and clever and the soldiers still wisecrack, but they are professional, no-nonsense killers who follow orders and get along with each other (unless really stressed) i.e. there is no contrived in-fighting.\\" Box Office Objective, Burma! was one of the most popular movies of 1945 in France. According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $2,117,000 domestically and $1,844,000 foreign. It was the studio's sixth most popular fil of the year, after Hollywood Canteen, To Have and Have Not, Arsenic and Old Lace, God Is My Co-Pilot and Christmas in Connecticut. Controversies Even though it was based on the exploits of Merrill's Marauders, Objective Burma was withdrawn from release in the United Kingdom after it infuriated British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and drew protests about the Americanization of an almost entirely British, Indian, and Commonwealth conflict.\\"British ban Objective Burma.\\" Army News (Darwin, NT: 1941–1946), September 27, 1945, p. 1. via National Library of Australia.

This system does not properly apply to the Chechen nation and the social structure of Chechen clans. Mamakaev proposed that the Chechen tukkhum was a type of military- economic union between certain groups of teips, not through consanguinity but established for specific purposes, such as military alliances and for economic trade. That the tukkhum occupied a specific territory, which was inhabited by the members of the tukkhum. He also stated that each tukkhum spoke a different dialect of the same Vainakh language. Etymology The term is of foreign origin and some suggest it comes from the old Persian word \\"tauhma\\" which meant kin or tribe. Tukkhum is a term often used by North Caucasians for a tribe or family, and is found among the Dagestani peoples such as Avars, Tabasarans, Kumyks and Lezghins. The term is used to describe different clan structures for different ethnicities, and does not mean the same thing from one ethnicity to the other. To Chechens it was introduced by Mamakaev in 1934 and it has been used in Chechen historical studies ever since. It is noted by the Caucasiologist Kharadze in 1968, that Mamakaev is the basis for the Chechen use of tukkhum, to make the social structure of the Chechens more complex and interesting. Despite the meaning of tukkhum not being clear in the Chechen language Proposed Tukkhum System The Coat of Arms of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria had nine stars on it to represent each Tukkhum. According to Mamakaev there were 9 Tukkhums: However this has been heavily criticized as some of the Tukkhums mentioned were in fact nothing more than large teips, with several \\"gar\\" (sub-clans). Teips such as Mälkhi and Terloy for example are traditionally 2 teips, consisting of several \\"gar\\". These teips have all the characteristics of a Chechen teip. Mamakaev incorrectly wrote down these large teips as \\"tukkhum\\" and their gars as teips under this tukkhum, even though they were never teips, but merely branches of that specific teip.

It was founded by Getúlio Vargas when he transformed his Estado Novo into a multi-party system. The PSD was a centrist party which represented the more conservative wing of the Getulist movement. The other pro-Vargas party was the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). The PSD was the most important Brazilian political party during the 1945–1964 democratic period, electing Presidents Eurico Gaspar Dutra in 1945 and Juscelino Kubitschek in 1955. After the coup d'état in 1964, when military dictatorship kicked in, it was banned together with all other parties. The party relied on powerful networks of rural elites in the less-developed parts of the country. It was dominated by executives appointed by the Getúlio Vargas regime and was therefore strongly interwoven with the state apparatus. It was ideologically moderate, considered centrist by some scholars and conservative by others. The PSD's representation in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies steadily shrunk from 52.8% of the seats in 1945 to 28.9% in 1962. By 1963, the Labour Party, PSD's minor opposition party, had more seats than the PSD. A considerable faction within the PSD turned against President João Goulart, a PTB member who had been Vice President until he stood in for retired President Jânio Quadros in 1961, whom they deemed to be too leftist. They therefore supported the military coup d'état on 1 April 1964, making an important contribution to the success of the overthrow. During the military rule installed by the 1964 coup, the bulk of the party, including most of its leaders, joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the only legal opposition party. A few elements of the PSD's right wing joined the pro-government National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA). A second Social Democratic Party was founded in 1987, after the end of the dictatorship. It was based in the rural center-west and led by Ronaldo Caiado, leader of the right-wing landowners' association União Democrática Ruralista. In elections it remained completely unimportant.

It is a non-eurozone member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Since its establishment in 1818, the objective of the Nationalbank as an independent and credible institution is to issue the Danish currency, the krone, and ensure its stability. The Board of Governors holds full responsibility for the monetary policy.The National Bank of Denmark Act, 1936 - Fraser: Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Access date: 12 July 2012. The building which houses the bank's headquarters was designed by the renowned architect Arne Jacobsen, in collaboration with Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling. After Jacobsen's death, his office, renamed Dissing+Weitling, has brought the construction to completion. Danmarks Nationalbank undertakes all functions related to the management of the Danish central-government debt. The division of responsibility is set out in an agreement between the Ministry of Finance of Denmark and Danmarks Nationalbank. Danish and Faroese banknotes were previously printed at Danmarks Nationalbank's Banknote Printing Works. This practice came to an end 20 December 2016, after which the printing of banknotes has been outsourced due to a reduced demand for cash, and cut in expenses of 100 million kroner until 2020. History The bank was established on 1 August 1818 by King Frederick VI of Denmark. The private bank was given a 90-year monopoly on currency issue, which was extended in 1907 out to 1938.

The estate is equipped with two golf courses and seven smaller listed buildings, apart from the main house. The freehold on the estate is held by The 3rd Baron Brocket. The house is Grade I-listed. History On the parkland site were two predecessors, the first of which was built in 1239 as Watership or Durantshide Manor, early held variously of Hatfield Manor and the Bishop of Ely. One of these was built about 1430; whereas in 1413 John Mortimer held Waterships it is known in 1477 Thomas Brockett held both manors. The house was acquired by John Brocket in the early 1550s and passed to his son Sir John Brocket (Captain of Queen Elizabeth's personal guard) on his death in 1558. The building and park owe much of their appearance today to Sir Matthew Lamb, 1st Baronet, who purchased the estate in 1746 and commissioned Brocket Hall to the designs of the architect Sir James Paine in around 1760. Sir Matthew Lamb's son was Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne, and he was often visited at Brocket Hall by the Prince Regent, who had a liaison with Lady Melbourne. The next owner was The 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was Queen Victoria's first Prime Minister 1835–41, when she regularly visited. His wife, Lady Caroline Lamb, infamously had an affair with Lord Byron causing Lord Melbourne much embarrassment. For one of his birthdays she held a state banquet in the Saloon, at which she had herself served from a large silver dish, naked. On Lamb's death, the house passed to his sister, Emily, whose second husband was another Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston. On Emily's death, the hall then passed to Emily's grandson by her first marriage, The 7th Earl Cowper, though it was his younger brother, Henry (d.1887), who lived at Brocket Hall. Lord Mount Stephen and King George V at a shoot hosted by Mount Stephen at Brocket Hall Brocket Hall as a maternity home in 1942 In 1893, The 1st Baron Mount Stephen, President of the Bank of Montreal and the first Canadian to be elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom, leased Brocket Hall from the 7th Earl for the remainder of his lifetime. For the next three years guests included the Queen's children: The Prince and Princess of Wales, The Duke and Duchess of Connaught and the Princess Mary, Duchess of Teck. In 1897, one year after his first wife died in 1896, Lord Mount Stephen married Georgina Mary (known as Gian) Tufnell, the Lady-in-Waiting to Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, who encouraged the match. Gian was a lifelong friend and confidant of the Duchess's daughter, Mary of Teck, the wife of King George V, and the Mount Stephenses regularly entertained the Royal couple. Gian preferred life at Brocket Hall to the social life that surrounded their London residence at Carlton House Terrace. Lady Mount Stephen was a close friend of Georgina, Marchioness of Salisbury, who lived on the neighbouring estate, Hatfield House. After the death of The 7th Earl Cowper (1905), the underlying future reversion was left to his niece, but she died only a year after him (1906) and the estate passed to her husband, Admiral Lord Walter Kerr, who lived at Melbourne Hall. When the life tenant Lord Mount Stephen died in 1921, Kerr put the estate up for sale and in 1923 it was purchased by Sir Charles Nall-Cain, who co-ran the brewing company Walker Cain Ltd; he was created Baron Brocket in 1933. His son, The 2nd Baron Brocket, was a Nazi sympathiser and, when he was interned during the Second World War, his property was sequestrated and put to use as a maternity hospital.

Location The estate almost touches the A1(M) motorway near Welwyn Garden City which is on the opposite side of the motorway; administratively and historically it lies at the extreme northern end of Hatfield.Grid square map Ordnance survey website Park and lake In the 1770s the park was landscaped making use of the River Lea which is regulated by a weir to form a \\"broadwater\\" or lake. Next to the weir is a neoclassical bridge, often described as Palladian, which carries an approach drive across the river: it is faced in Portland stone and was designed by Paine. The Palladian bridge at Brocket Hall The park is listed as Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The parkland is since the mid-1990s largely overlain by golf courses and is bounded by substantial woodland belts. Paine also built the Temple with an Adam-style plaster ceiling, elliptical porch that has niches either side of a Victorian period half glazed door and a pediment above its eastern entrance, typical of the finest garden temples of the era. Among other buildings on the estate is Brocket Lea, an early 17th-century house on the south side of the river Lea. In popular culture Brocket Hall has been used as filming location for a number of large-scale film and television productions, including Night of the Demon (1957), Murder with Mirrors, Johnny English Reborn, The Queen, Willow and Pride and Prejudice featuring Colin Firth.\\"Johnny English and his links to Hertfordshire - News\\", Welwyn Hatfield Times, 15 October 2011.

It was also used in EastEnders on 1 January 2017 when characters Ronnie Mitchell and Jack Branning got married and Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell died. Brocket Hall was also in Holby City for a wedding. The same venue was used in the Shakin' Stevens Video of \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" in 1980. The British pop group Steps used it as the location for their 2001 music video for \\"It's The Way You Make Me Feel\\".

He soon began contributing to Zagreb's Danas weekly magazine, as well as to the Social Research Center (Centar za društvena istrazivanja). Between 1984 and 1986, he worked as analyst in the Federal Interior Secretariat and State Security Service.Sahranjen Slavko Ćuruvija, Vreme No. 6, 17 April 1999 Career in journalism In 1986, Ćuruvija joined the staff of Borba: initially as commentator, then advancing to the position of domestic political section editor, and eventually becoming Borbas editor-in-chief. In 1987 he was one of the few journalists allowed to stand next to Slobodan Milošević during his visit to Kosovo Polje on 24 April.Deset godina ubojstva Ćuruvije He stayed with the daily paper until 1994 while regularly contributing to Vjesnik, NIN, Večernji list, Pobjeda, TV Belgrade, and other media sources. In 1994, after the regime's unofficial takeover at Borba, Ćuruvija, along with many other staffers decided to leave the daily. While some of them quickly reconvened to form Naša borba, Ćuruvija took another career route, hooking up with Momčilo Đorgović to found Nedeljni telegraf, a weekly tabloid newspaper. In 1996, the duo founded Dnevni telegraf, Serbia's first privately owned daily in more than 50 years. Ćuruvija was DTs director and editor-in-chief, and eventually, after splitting with Đorgović, its sole owner. In 1998, Ćuruvija additionally founded a bi-weekly magazine Evropljanin where he gathered some prominent Serbian journalists, including Aleksandar Tijanić and Ljiljana Smajlović.

Not many specific, established details indicating the extent of their relationship are known. Most come from second or third hand accounts. Radio Television of Serbia produced a television documentary Kad režim strelja (2006), Aleksandar Tijanić refers to it as a \\"non-aggression pact between Mira and Slavko allowing him access to many relevant pieces of information that ultimately greatly increased Dnevni telegrafs readership\\", while Ćuruvija's common-law wife Branka Prpa who was with him at the time of his murder attaches less significance to this friendship saying that it \\"revolved around conversations that many other journalists engaged in with Mira Marković hoping to manipulate her into revealing more than she'd originally planned\\". Prpa went on to add: \\"However, I think they became the ones being manipulated as the time went on\\".Slađana Zarić, RTS 2006 TV documentary Kad režim strelja (also on Youtube) Whatever it was, their relationship was deteriorating by the day in late summer and early fall of 1998. Yugoslav army and Serbian police were in various stages of a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, and both of Ćuruvija's publications reported extensively on all of these issues, all of which earned Dnevni telegraf a ban on 14 October 1998 under a special new decree. Furious with these new developments, Ćuruvija demanded to see Mira Marković and a meeting was arranged at her party's (Yugoslav Left) offices during the week Dnevni telegraf was banned as the new Information Law was being prepared. The meeting, reportedly quickly turned into a heated exchange. Branka Prpa, Ćuruvija's common-law wife, and Ljiljana Smajlović, co-worker, said that one of the things that got him in trouble with the Milošević regime was the article about Attack on Prekaz because he didn't call all killed Kosovo Albanians “terrorists”. According to Predrag Popović's book Oni ne praštaju (written from the author's subsequent interviews with Ćuruvija), Ćuruvija was shouting: \\"What the hell do you think you're doing. If you continue down this crazy path, you can be sure you'll all be hanging off lamp posts in Terazije\\". Visibly flustered, Mira reportedly responded: \\"How can you say that Slavko, after all we've allowed you\\". Slavko's later comment was also published in the book: \\"Evidently she thought she'd done me a great favour by allowing me to live a normal life and publish newspapers all those years\\". The meeting, their last ever, ended with Ćuruvija saying: \\"Say hello to your husband for me.\\" To which [a] visibly shook up Mira responded: \\"I will not do that, but I will tell him everything you said.\\" People who happened to be in the building said Mira Marković was crying after the meeting.Predrag Popović,Oni ne prastaju, INFO ORFEJ, 2001 In April 2006 article on B92 TV commemorating 7 years since the unsolved murder of Ćuruvija, his wife Branka Prpa recounted few more details of the Ćuruvija-Marković exchange: \\"He was shouting 'What are you doing this for? You're going to cause a widespread war!' Mira then told him 'Oh, so you want them to bomb us.'

The issue came out on 19 October 1998, one day before the Information Law was passed, which did not stop the authorities from putting Ćuruvija and his paper on trial four days later and prosecuting them under the same law. The culmination of the day-long trial was a DM350,000 fine.

The formal accusation for the murder was expected by February 2014, the key witness for the prosecution being Milorad Ulemek Legija, former commander of Special Operations Unit of the Serbian secret police.

World Tai Chi & Qigong Day also acts as an information source on medical research and finding classes in those disciplines. Overview The annual April event is open to the general public, and begins in the earliest time zones of Samoa at 10 am, and then participants across Oceania, Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America take part, with celebrations in eighty nations and several hundred cities, ending with the final events in the last time zones of Hawaii almost an entire day later. Celebrations include mass t'ai chi ch'uan and qigong exhibitions in many cities, and free classes in most participating cities. World Tai Chi and Qigong Day's stated goals are to: # Educate the world about emerging medical research revealing health benefits that t'ai chi ch'uan and qigong offer. # Educate about the increasing use of these ancient traditional Chinese medicine modalities in business, healthcare, education, penal and drug rehabilitation. # Provide a global vision of cooperation for health & healing purposes across geopolitical boundaries, and also an appeal to people worldwide to embrace wisdom from all the cultures of the world. # Thank Chinese culture for the gifts of tai chi and qigong to the world. Organization World Tai Chi & Qigong Day event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The local events are independently organized by local Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong schools, groups, and associations. The format of events varies by locality, although most involve free classes and mass exhibitions. International organizing for the event is done at the World Tai Chi and Qigong Day office in Overland Park, Kansas. History The global event began in 1999. However the first event, that inspired the global event, was held in Kansas City, Missouri in 1998 on the lawn of the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in midtown Kansas City, where the Kansas City Tai Chi Club held a mass Tai Chi exhibition and teach-in involving nearly two-hundred people. CNN Headline News covered the event, which generated interest beyond Kansas City to quickly grow into a national and international event in the following years. World Tai Chi and Qigong Day has been officially proclaimed by governors of twenty-five US states, the senates of California, New York, and Puerto Rico, by Brazil's National Council of Deputies, and officials in several nations. In 2013 Harvard Medical School launched a series of lectures regarding medical research on tai chi benefits. The Harvard lecture series homepage was titled \\"Celebrating World Tai Chi Day.\\" \\"The Harvard Medical School Guide to Tai Chi,\\" released in 2012, cited World Tai Chi Day, writing, \\"A reflection of how successful the invasion of [of tai chi] has been is World Tai Chi Day, organized by Bill Douglas. One of the purposes of this day is \\"to bring people across racial, economic, religious, and geo-political boundaries, to join together for the purpose of health and healing, providing an example to the world.\\" Millions of people around the world—65 nations participated in 2011—gather one day each year to celebrate the health and healing benefits of Tai Chi and Qigong.\\" This global event was founded by Bill Douglas and Angela Wong Douglas, co-authors of \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and Qigong\\" (Penguin Alpha Books, fourth edition, 2012). Their book's chapter entitled, \\"World T'ai Chi and Qigong Day,\\" was a major force behind the global awareness of this health and healing event. In 2013 the National Council of Deputies in Brazil joined 22 U.S. Governors, the Senates of California, New York, and Puerto Rico and other officials and bodies from around the world in recognizing World Tai Chi & Qigong Day. Local and national media worldwide have covered World Tai Chi & Qigong Day events, including Agence France Presse TV; Egyptian national television news; and New York City's Central Park event was covered by NDT Television News. In 2019 Southampton City Council celebrated World Tai Chi & Qigong Day alongside UK Shaolin Temple, who jointly held a free public event in Southampton’s Guildhall Square on Saturday 27th April 2019. The event highlighted the importance of mental health and wellbeing awareness with free Tai Chi and Qigong taster sessions. Near to one hundred attendees sampled a number of simple exercise routines to incorporate into their daily routines. The message of the event also reached hundreds of thousands of people through social media and regional press coverage including the Southern Daily Echo Press and BBC Solent.

The book sought to clearly outline the manner in which the post–World War II United States was becoming wealthy in the private sector but remained poor in the public sector, lacking social and physical infrastructure, and perpetuating income disparities. The book sparked much public discussion at the time. It is also credited with popularizing the term \\"conventional wisdom\\". Many of the ideas presented were later expanded and refined in Galbraith's 1967 book, The New Industrial State. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich called it his favorite on the subject of economics. The Modern Library placed the book at no. 46 on its list of the top 100 English-language non-fiction books of the 20th century. Themes * The \\"central tradition\\" in economics, created by Adam Smith and expanded by David Ricardo and Thomas Robert Malthus in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, is poorly suited to the affluent post–World War II U.S. society. This is so because the \\"central tradition\\" economists wrote during a time of widespread poverty where production of basic goods was necessary. U.S. society, at the time of Galbraith's writing, was one of widespread affluence, where production was based on luxury goods and wants. * Using production, or gross domestic product, as a measure of U.S. society's well-being omits important measures of social and personal well-being. GDP also neglects differences in output. For example, \\"An increased supply of educational services has a standing in the total not different in kind from an increased output of television receivers.\\"Galbraith, John Kenneth. The Affluent Society Fortieth Anniversary Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company: New York, 1998. p 100, 109, 158, 170, 259, 260 Production has risen to its paramount but unwarranted status because it is held in grace by both Democrats and Republicans. Galbraith writes: > On the importance of production as a test of performance, there is no > difference between Republicans and Democrats, right and left, white and > minimally prosperous black, Catholic and Protestant. It is common ground for > the Chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, the President of the United > States Chamber of Commerce and the President of the National Association of > Manufactures. * American demand for goods and services is not organic. That is, the demands are not internally created by a consumer. These such demands - food, clothes, and shelter - have been met for the vast majority of Americans. The new demands are created by advertisers and the \\"machinery for consumer-demand creation\\" that benefit from increased consumer spending. This exuberance in private production and consumption pushes out public spending and investment. He called this the dependence effect, a process by which \\"wants are increasingly created by the process by which they are satisfied\\". * Galbraith believes America must transition from a private production economy to a public investment economy. He advocates three large proposals: the elimination of poverty, government investment in public schools, and the growth of the \\"New Class.\\" Galbraith outlines the two types of poverty to better understand the causes and potential remedies. Case poverty is related to a specific individual and insular poverty is an island where nearly everyone is poor. To fund social programs, Galbraith believes in the expanded use of consumption taxes. The \\"New Class\\" consists of schoolteachers, professors, surgeons, and electrical engineers. Galbraith ends the book with another appeal to the importance and need for investment in educating people: :“Whether the problem be that of a burgeoning population and of space in which to live with peace and grace, or whether it be the depletion of the materials which nature has stocked in the earth’s crust and which have been drawn upon more heavily in this century than in all previous time together, or whether it be that of occupying minds no longer committed to the stockpiling of consumer goods, the basic demand on America will be on its resources of intelligence and education.” See also *History of economic thought *Marshall Sahlins articulated in 1966 the theory that hunter-gatherers were the original affluent society.

In other words, if person “A” has been vaccinated for virus X and person “B” has not, person “B” can receive immunity to virus X just by coming into contact with person “A”. The term was coined by Romanian physician Ioan Cantacuzino. The potential for contact immunity exists primarily in \\"live\\" or attenuated vaccines. Vaccination with a live, but attenuated, virus can produce immunity to more dangerous forms of the virus. These attenuated viruses produce little or no illness in most people. However, the live virus multiplies briefly, may be shed in body fluids or excrement, and can be contracted by another person. If this contact produces immunity and carries no notable risk, it benefits an additional person, and further increases the immunity of the group. The most prominent example of contact immunity was the oral polio vaccine (OPV). This live, attenuated polio vaccine was widely used in the US between 1960 and 1990; it continues to be used in polio eradication programs in developing countries because of its low cost and ease of administration. It is popular, in part, because it is capable of contact immunity. Recently immunized children \\"shed\\" live virus in their feces for a few days after immunization. About 25 percent of people coming into contact with someone immunized with OPV gained protection from polio through this form of contact immunity. Although contact immunity is an advantage of OPV, the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis—affecting 1 child per 2.4 million OPV doses administered—led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to cease recommending its use in the US as of January 1, 2010, in favor of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). The CDC continues to recommend OPV over IPV for global polio eradication activities. The main drawback of live virus–based vaccines is that a few people who are vaccinated or exposed to those who have been vaccinated may develop severe disease. Those with defective immune function are the most vulnerable. In the case of OPV, an average of eight to nine adults contracted paralytic polio from contact with a recently immunized child each year. As the risk of catching polio in the Western Hemisphere diminished, the risk of contact infection with the attenuated polio virus outweighed the advantages of OPV, leading the CDC to recommend its discontinuation. Contact immunity differs from herd immunity, a different type of group protection, in which risk for unimmunized individuals is reduced if they are surrounded by immunized individuals who are unlikely to contract, harbor, or transmit the disease.

While at school he was above average in mathematics, and discovered his calculating abilities as well as his faculty in memorizing numbers.

In 1931 Finkelstein went on an international tour demonstrating his abilities and submitting himself for tests. In 1932 he arrived in the United States and tried without success to find employment in a bank as a checker of calculations. In 1937 an article was published that described and analyzed his abilities, with the general conclusion that although he could perform calculations much more rapidly than most people, his thinking processes seem to obey the same laws and are not indicative of any unnatural powers. In particular, during multiplication, the time for performing operations was proportional not to the numbers of digits in multiplied numbers, but to the number of separate \\"acts of attention\\" necessary to perform multiplication by ordinary rules. Also, the correctness of the results was not always 100 percent, decreased rapidly with the growth of the number of \\"acts of attention\\", and apparently depended on concentration.

Houghton Mifflin) The Great Crash, 1929 is a book written by John Kenneth Galbraith and published in 1955. It is an economic history of the lead-up to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The book argues that the 1929 stock market crash was precipitated by rampant speculation in the stock market, that the common denominator of all speculative episodes is the belief of participants that they can become rich without workGalbraith, p10 and that the tendency towards recurrent speculative orgy serves no useful purpose, but rather is deeply damaging to an economy.Galbraith, p19 It was Galbraith's belief that a good knowledge of what happened in 1929 was the best safeguard against its recurrence.Galbraith. p28 The idea for the book Galbraith wrote the book during a break from working on the manuscript of what would become The Affluent Society. Galbraith was asked by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. if he would write the definitive work on the Great Depression that he would then use as a reference source for his own intended work on Roosevelt. Galbraith chose to concentrate on the days that ushered in the depression. \\"I never enjoyed writing a book more; indeed, it is the only one I remember in no sense as a labor but as a joy.\\"Galbraith, p9,10 Galbraith received much praise for his work, including his humorous observations of human behavior during the speculative stock market bubble and subsequent crash.”Professor Galbraith performed a necessary and useful task in producing a lively and highly readable account of that disaster...it abounds in witty remarks” --Financial Times; “The Great Crash, one of the most engrossing books I have ever read, is also tinged with grim humor” -- The Telegraph The publication of the book, which was one of Galbraith's first bestsellers, coincided with the 25th anniversary of the crash, at a time when it and the Great Depression that followed were still raw memories - and stock price levels were only then recovering to pre-crash levels. Galbraith considered it the useful task of the historian to keep fresh the memory of such crashes, the fading of which he correlates with their re-occurrence. The speculative bubble The Florida property bubble of the 1920s established the mood \\"and the conviction that God intended the American middle classes to be rich,\\" a sentiment so strong that it survived the ensuing crash of property prices.Galbraith, p35 In the early 1920s, yields of common stocks were favourable and prices low. In the final six months of 1924, prices began to rise and continued through 1925, from 106 in May 1924 stock prices rose to 181 by December 1925.Galbraith, p36 After a couple of short downturns during 1926, prices began to increase in earnest throughout 1927, the year in which conventional wisdom saw the seeds of what became the Great Crash sown. Following Britain's return to the Gold Standard, and subsequent foreign exchange crises, there followed an exodus of gold from Europe to the United States. In the spring of 1927, Montagu Norman and other governors of European Banks asked the Federal Reserve to ease their monetary policy and they agreed, reducing the rediscount rate from 4 to 3.5%, a move that Lional Robbins described as resulting “in one of the most costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years”. The funds released by the Fed became available to invest in the stock market and “from that date, according to all the evidence, the situation got completely out of control.”Galbraith, page 39 Galbraith disagreed with this simplistic analysis by arguing that the availability of money in the past was no sure recipe for a bubble in common stocks and that prices could still be regarded as a true valuation of the stock at the end of 1927. It is early in 1928 that the “escape into make believe” started in earnest, when the market began to rise by large vaulting leaps rather than steady increments. Prominent investors, such as Harrison Williams, the proponent of both the Shenandoah & Blue Ridge Trusts, were described by Professor Dice as “having vision for the future and boundless hope and optimism” and not “hampered by the heavy armour of tradition”.Galbraith, page 42 On 12 March, the volume of trading had reached 3,875,910 shares, an all-time high. By 20 June, 5,052,790 shares were traded in a falling market that many prematurely thought signalled the end of the bull market.Galbraith, p43 Prices rose once more and after the election of Hoover, with a “victory boom” resulting in an all-time record trading of 6,641,250 shares in a rising market (16 November). Overall, the market rose during the year from 245 to 331 which was accompanied by a phenomenal increase in trading on margin,Galbraith, p46 which relieved the buyer from putting up the full purchase price of the stock by using the securities as collateral for a loan. The buyer obtained full benefit of ownership in rising stock valuation, but the loan amount remained the same. People swarmed to buy stock on margin. In the early 1920s, brokers' loans used to finance purchases on margin averaged 1–1.5 billion but by November 1928 had reached six billion. By the end of 1928, the interest on such loans was yielding 12% to lenders which led to a flood of gold converging on Wall St. from all over the world to fuel the purchase of stocks on margin.Galbraith, p49 Aftermath of the crash In the wake of Black Tuesday, London newspapers reported that ruined speculators were throwing themselves from windows but Galbraith asserts there was no substance to these claims of widespread suicides.Galbraith, P148 Embezzlement now came to the fore. During the bubble, there was a net increase of what Galbraith calls “psychic wealth”; the person being robbed was unaware of their loss whilst the embezzler was materially improved. With the bursting of the bubble, accounts were now more closely scrutinized and reports of defaulting employees became a daily occurrence after the first week of the crash. The looting of the Union Industrial Bank became the most spectacular embezzlement of the period. Unknown to each other, several of the bank's officers began making away with funds for speculation. Over a period of time, they became aware of each other's activities and unable to expose each other entered into a cooperative venture which in time came to include all of the principal officers of the bank. They took a short position just as the market “soared into the blue yonder of the summer sky”; so costly was this to the group that they took a long position just before the crash and this was to prove a mortal blow.Galbraith, p154 The influence of the Wall Street crash on the Great Depression Contrary to what had been Wall Street's perceived tendency in playing down its influence, Galbraith asserted the important contribution of the 1929 crash on the Great Depression which followed:Galbraith, p203 causing a contraction of demand for goods, destroying for a time the normal means of investment and lending, arresting economic growth and causing financial hardship which alienated many from the economic system. Galbraith further argues that the Great Depression was caused by a mixture of five main weaknesses: First, an imbalance in the income distribution. Galbraith asserts \\"that the 5 per cent of the population with the highest incomes in that year [1929] received approximately one third of all personal income\\". Personal income in the form of rents, dividends and interest of the well-to-do was approximately twice as much as the period following the Second World War, leaving the economy dependent on a high level of investment and, or, luxury consumer spending with its potential exposure to the Crash of 1929.Galbraith, p195 Second, problems in the structure of corporations. Most specifically, he cites newly formed investment entities of the era (such as holding companies and investment trusts) as contributing to a deflationary spiral due in no small part to their high reliance on leverage. Dividends paid the interest on the bonds in the holding companies and when these were interrupted the structure collapsed. “It would be hard to imagine a corporate system better designed to continue and accentuate a deflationary cycle.\\" Also “The fact was that American enterprise in the twenties had opened its hospitable arms to an exceptional number of promoters, grafters, swindlers, impostors, and frauds. This, in the long history of such activities, was a kind of flood tide of corporate larceny.\\" Third, the bad banking structure. The weakness was manifest in the large number of units working independently. As one failed pressure was applied to another leading to a domino effect accelerated by increasing unemployment and lower incomes.Galbraith, p197 Fourth, foreign trade imbalances. During World War I, the US became a creditor nation, exporting more than it imported. High tariffs on imports contributed to this imbalance. Subsequent defaults by foreign governments led to a decline in exports, which was especially hard on farmers. And finally, \\"the poor state of economic intelligence\\". Galbraith says that the \\"economists and those who offered economic counsel in the late twenties and early thirties were almost uniquely perverse\\" and that \\"the burden of reputable economic advice was invariably on the side of measures that would make things worse\\".Galbraith, p200 Prospects for recurrence Galbraith was of the opinion that the Great Crash had burned itself so deeply into the national consciousness that America had been spared another bubble up to the present time (1954).;Galbraith, p28 however he thought the chances of another speculative orgy which characterized the 1929 crash as rather good as he felt the American people remained susceptible to the conviction that unlimited rewards were to be had and that they individually were meant to share in it. He considered the sense of responsibility in the financial community for the wider community as a whole as not being small but \\"nearly nil\\".Galbraith, p20 Even though government powers were available to prevent a recurrence of a bubble their use was not attractive or politically expedient since an election is in the offing even on the day after an election.Galbraith, p206  Reception and popular culture  In 2008 and 2009, Jim Cramer took to waving John Kenneth Galbraith's book,Someday We'll All Look Back on This and Laugh.... Esquire. and praising it on his show Mad Money.

(1931). The Roman Library at Timgad. Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 9, 157-165. The library contained an expansive arched hall which consisted of a reading room, stack room, and a rotunda for lectures. The library was quite large measuring in length by in width. Oblong alcoves held wooden cabinets along walls of which the manuscripts were maintained. In addition, there is evidence for free-standing bookcases in the center as well as a reading desk. There is no evidence as to how many books the library held although it is estimated that it could have accommodated 3000 scrolls. Anatolia ; Hattusa (1900 B.C. – 1190 B.C.) (modern Bogazkoy) : This archive constituted the largest collection of Hittite texts discovered with approximately thirty thousand inscribed cuneiform tablets. The tablets had also been classified according to a precise system. ; Royal Library of Antioch (221 B.C. – 363 A.D.) (Modern Antakya) : The library was commissioned in the third century B.C. by Euphorion of Chalcis by the Greek sovereign Antiochus III the Great. Euphorion was an academic and was also the chief librarian. ; Library of Pergamum (197 B.C. – 159 B.C.) (modern Bergama) : The Attalid kings formed the second-best Hellenistic library after Alexandria, founded in emulation of the Ptolemies. Parchment, a predecessor of vellum and paper, was widely used in the library, and came to be known as pergamum after the city. The library had collected over 200,000 volumes and the reason why the library was so successful was because of Pergamum's hegemony which was a purveyor of scholarship.Murray, S. (2009).

China  ;Han Imperial Library : Catalogue preserved in the Yiwenzhi chapter of the Book of Han. At the time of inventory contained 596 works divided into six genres: scripture, philosophy, poetry, warfare, astrology, and medicine. ;Qin reign (third century BCE) :It was the practice of Chinese emperors to assemble and maintain their official written archive. The first Qin emperor was a determined opponent of Confucianism, and worked to eradicate texts and teachings of that philosophy. ;Tang dynasty (6th–10th century) : The Tang Dynasty is known as the Golden Age of Imperial Chinese history. Academy libraries were places where young men came to study for civil service exams, and became an important part of the Chinese meritocracy. Private collection of books was also common during this time. Wood-block printing spread throughout the kingdom at this time, making books more affordable. Social status was determined, in part, by the cultural refinement acquired through personal book collections.  Egypt  ; The Royal Library of Alexandria, Egypt, fl. 3rd century BC (c. 295 BC). : Founded by Ptolemy, this library was said to have amassed an estimated 400,000 manuscripts and was considered the leading intellectual metropolis of the Hellenistic world. The Serapeum in Alexandria served as an extension of the library. ;Serapeum of Alexandria :Offshoot collection of the great Library of Alexandria ; Temple of Edfu Archive/Library (237–57 B.C.) : This library was an extension of the Temple itself. The walls of this chamber are bestrewn with engravings and captions depicting numerous receptacles filled with manuscripts of papyrus as well as scrolls bound in leather. These documents chronicled the circadian workings of the temple, but also detailed construction drafts and directives on how the temple walls should be decorated.  Ethiopia  ; The Library of Aksum : The kingdom of Aksum, by the first century CE, was a noted trading hub for Europe, Asia, and Africa. By the third century, it was the equal of the Roman, Persian, and Chinese empires. Aksum had a unique written language, Ge'ez, and their libraries held their own translation of the Christian Bible, and other important early Christian works. It is believed that Coptic monks translated many of these works. Notably, the Book of Enoch, a pre-Christian religious text, was originally written in Ge'ez. By the 7th century CE, the kingdom of Aksum fell due to Islamic expansion, agricultural difficulties, and a trading shift away from the Red Sea in favor of the Persian Gulf, but it is remembered as a society that celebrated literacy, education, and libraries. Greece ; The Library of Aristotle (Athens) (384–321 B.C.) : The Library of Aristotle was a private library and the earliest one reported on by ancient chroniclers.

A record of individuals who were supposedly responsible for the establishment of the library are acknowledged in an inscription near the monument. ; The Library of Pantainos (Athens) (100 A.D.) : Dedicated to both Athena Archegetis and the Roman emperor Trajan, the library was connected to the Agora in Athens. Titus Flavius Pantainos had it built, and he, along with his children, also devoted it to the citizens of Athens. While the precise date of its dedication is not clear, it is believed to have been dedicated between 98 AD and 102 AD. There is speculation that the library may have actually been built by the father of Pantainos. Being a Roman-period library, the design is quite unconventional. A spacious alcove with an adjoining courtyard enclosed by three galleries formed the arrangement of the structure. An inscription discovered dictates proper library etiquette: \\"No book is to be taken out because we have sworn an oath. The library is to be open first hour until the sixth.\\" The library was ultimately consumed by the invading Germanic Heruli tribe in 267 AD. ; The Library of Rhodes (Rhodes) (100 A.D.) : The library on the island of Rhodes was a distinct component of the larger gymnasium structure. An enclosure that had been excavated revealed a section of a catalog analogous to modern library catalogs. The catalog, which classified titles by subject, displayed an inventory of authors in consecutive order together with their published efforts. It has also been determined that the library employed a qualified librarian. ; Hadrian's Library (Athens) (132 A.D.) : It was created by Roman Emperor Hadrian on the north side of the Acropolis of Athens. The library was seriously damaged by the Herulian invasion of 267 and repaired later. During Byzantine times, three churches were built at the site, the remains of which are preserved.

History The area of present- day Ōshū was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Japanese Paleolithic period. Isawa is especially rich in Kofun Period remains from the 5th century. By the Nara period, Japanese hunters, trappers, settlers and itinerant missionaries were visiting and settling in this area, and coming into contact with the native Emishi people. In 729, Kokuseki-ji temple claims to have been established by the Buddhist priest Gyōki in a mountainous area to the east of the Kitakami River in what is now Mizusawa. In 776, two separate attacks were launched by the Yamato dynasty against the Emishi with little success. In June 787 Emishi cavalry led by Aterui and More surprised and routed a larger force of Japanese infantry in the Battle of Subuse (located in what is now part of Mizusawa). Despite these successes the Emishi could not hold out against the Japanese and in 802 Aterui and More surrendered and were beheaded. That same year Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, established Isawa Castle. Despite the victory the Japanese found if difficult to rule the territory directly. Six semi-autonomous districts were established along the Kitakami River. Eventually these came under the control of a powerful Emishi clan from Appi, the Abe clan. Early in the 11th century Abe no Yoritoki refused to pay taxes to the central government, led raiding parties south of the Koromo River, and generally ruled as an independent monarch. This led to the or Early Nine-Years War (1050 - 1062), in which Minamoto no Yoriyoshi reinforced by Kiyohara no Takenori from Dewa Province defeated the Abe clan. The area later came under the rule of the Kiyohara clan. Corrupt administration by the Kiyohara led to the Gosannen War (後三年合戦) or Latter Three Years' War (1083 - 1087) in which Minamoto no Yoshiie subdued the Kiyohara. Fujiwara no Kiyohira, the founder of the Ōshū Fujiwara dynasty, was born in Fort Toyota which is now in the Iwayado area of Esashi. Around 1100, he relocated to Hiraizumi where he and his descendants ruled for nearly a hundred years. In 1348, a Zen Buddhist priest named Mutei Ryōshō founded the temple of Shōbō-ji near Kokuseki-ji temple in Mizusawa. It is the third head temple of the Sōtō sect of Zen Buddhism and boasts the largest thatched roof in Japan. During the Sengoku period, the area came under control of the powerful Date clan. During this period, Italian Jesuit missionaries regarded it as a kingdom. which they called \\"Voxu\\". Following the Battle of Sekigahara, the Tokugawa shogunate confirmed the area was part of Sendai Domain under Date Masamune. One of his retainers was a certain Juan Gotō who commanded Date Masamune's gun regiment at Osaka in 1614 and 1615. He was also a Kirishitan and established a church in the Fukuwara area of Mizusawa. After Christianity was outlawed in 1623 he went into hiding to escape capture. Foreign missionaries continued to visit the area in secret until December 1623 when the Jesuit Padre Diogo de Carvalho from Portugal was captured on the upper reaches of the Isawa River, sent to Sendai and forced to stand in the frozen Hirose River until he died in the early hours of what was then New Year's Day, namely February 19, 1624. There is a memorial to Juan Gotō in the Fukuwara area and many crypto-Christian remains can still be seen in that neighborhood. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was assigned to Iwate Prefecture rather than Miyagi Prefecture as part of the governments efforts to break up former Sendai Domain, partly due to its role in opposing the Meiji government during the Boshin War. The town of Mizusawa was created within Isawa District on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1954.

Formerly a shallow, postglacial lake draining into Lake Michigan, it has been changed beyond recognition by industrial redevelopment and decay. Parts of the lake have been dredged, and other parts reshaped by landfill. Together with the rest of the city of Chicago, the remnant of the lake now drains into the Des Plaines River and the Mississippi River basin. Calumet is a Norman word used since the 17th century by French colonists in Canada for the ceremonial pipes they saw used by First Nations peoples.  History  Until the 1800s, Lake Calumet was near the center of an extensive wetland area near the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Like other wetland areas, the Lake Calumet area and its rivers were a center of Native American life and settlement. The Field Museum maintains databases of archeological data on these settlements. In 1861, the Lake Calumet region was mapped into Hyde Park Township, south of what was then the town of Chicago. In the 1880s, because the lake's Calumet River created shipping opportunities to connect into Lake Michigan, the swampy zone was rapidly filled and developed by industry. Hyde Park Township developed rapidly and was annexed into Chicago in 1889. The area remains heavily industrialized today. The Chicago neighborhood of Pullman was developed as a company town with residences and services offered for rent to the workers in railroad passenger car factories. The complex, now a National Monument, is sited on the lake's west shore. Steel mills began to line the Calumet River. The Illinois Central railroad was built nearby. In the 1950s, part of the former lakebed was used as a right-of-way for a freeway, which was originally named in the lake's honor as the Calumet Expressway. Another parcel of former wetland, south of the lake, was designated as what is now the Paxton Landfill, the final home for much of the household and industrial solid waste generated within the city of Chicago. Some of the landfill was steel mill slag and other industrial wastes. The revelation of hazardous chemicals in much of the fill material has created a push to have parts of the Lake Calumet area added to the national Superfund list for environmental cleanup.Bob Tita, \\"Former dump getting capped\\", Crain's Chicago Business, 23 October 2006, p. 20. In the early 1980s, the Lake Calumet area was proposed as a site for the later- cancelled Chicago 1992 World's Fair. In 1989, Mayor Richard M. Daley, announced his proposal for the Lake Calumet Airport, a proposal which failed within three years. In 1996, the Calumet Expressway was renamed the Bishop Ford Freeway, honoring Chicago religious leader Bishop Louis Henry Ford. Today The remains of Lake Calumet lie east of the Bishop Ford Freeway (Interstate 94) on the far south side of Chicago, between 103rd and 130th streets. The lake is part of the underutilized Port of Chicago. A lakeside grain elevator can be seen from the freeway. South of the lake, the freeway passes the Paxton Landfill, including pipes that collect methane and other gases generated by the landfill. The vestigial lake officially lies within Chicago's South Deering community area. Cleanup efforts in former landfills areas continue ; see Superfund status subsection below.  Ecology  The wetlands surrounding Lake Calumet were noted as the only location where specimens of Thismia americana, an example of endemic wet prairie flora, were ever collected. Due to the profound physical changes that have taken place in the Lake Calumet catchment area, this plant is now believed to be extinct. Although Lake Calumet has undergone extensive human alteration over the period from 1880 through 2010, parts of the basin remain a wetland. The basin has been designated an Important Bird Area of Illinois and is part of the flyway along Lake Michigan and the rivers.  Superfund status  On March 2, 2010, the EPA designated the Lake Calumet Cluster, a cluster of sites grouped around Lake Calumet, for the Superfund List. Several local areas within this cluster are extremely hazardous; excavation workers must use masks and self-contained supplies of air or oxygen. Despite these challenges, planners hope to conduct remedial cleanups of less-severely contaminated sites to permit adaptive reuse. They will cap the more heavily contaminated sites within the cluster. Landfill gas could be collected and the methane filtered for use.

A laurel wreath is a round wreath made of connected branches and leaves of the bay laurel (), an aromatic broadleaf evergreen, or later from spineless butcher's broom (Ruscus hypoglossum) or cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus). It is a symbol of triumph and is worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck. The symbol of the laurel wreath traces back to Greek mythology. Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head, and wreaths were awarded to victors in athletic competitions, including the ancient Olympics — for which they were made of wild olive-tree known as \\"kotinos\\" (), (sc. at Olympia)—and in poetic meets. In Rome they were symbols of martial victory, crowning a successful commander during his triumph. Whereas ancient laurel wreaths are most often depicted as a horseshoe shape, modern versions are usually complete rings. In common modern idiomatic usage, it refers to a victory. The expression \\"resting on one's laurels\\" refers to someone relying entirely on long-past successes for continued fame or recognition, where to \\"look to one's laurels\\" means to be careful of losing rank to competition. Background Apollo and Daphne Apollo, the patron of sport, is associated with the wearing of a laurel wreath. This association arose from the ancient Greek mythology story of Apollo and Daphne. Apollo mocked the god of love, Eros (Cupid), for his use of bow and arrow, since Apollo is also patron of archery. The insulted Eros then prepared two arrows—one of gold and one of lead. He shot Apollo with the gold arrow, instilling in the god a passionate love for the river nymph Daphne. He shot Daphne with the lead arrow, instilling in her a hatred of Apollo. Apollo pursued Daphne until she begged to be free of him and was turned into a laurel tree. Apollo vowed to honor Daphne forever and used his powers of eternal youth and immortality to render the laurel tree evergreen. Apollo then crafted himself a wreath out of the laurel branches and turned Daphne into a cultural symbol for him and other poets and musicians.  Academic use  An actress performing a play. She wears a laurel wreath and stands in front of a statue of a woman from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, The British Museum, London In some countries the laurel wreath is used as a symbol of the master's degree. The wreath is given to young masters at the university graduation ceremony. The word \\"laureate\\" in 'poet laureate' refers to the laurel wreath. The medieval Florentine poet and philosopher Dante Alighieri, a member of the Sicilian School, is often represented in paintings and sculpture wearing a laurel wreath. In Italy, the term laureato is used in to refer to any student who has graduated. Right after the graduation ceremony, or laurea in Italian, the student receives a laurel wreath to wear for the rest of the day. This tradition originated at the University of Padua and has spread in the last two centuries to all Italian universities. Ovid with laurel wreath, common in poets At Connecticut College in the United States, members of the junior class carry a laurel chain, which the seniors pass through during commencement. It represents nature and the continuation of life from year to year. Immediately following commencement, the junior girls write out with the laurels their class year, symbolizing they have officially become seniors and the period will repeat itself the following spring. At Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA, laurel has been a fixture of commencement traditions since 1900, when graduating students carried or wore laurel wreaths. In 1902, the chain of mountain laurel was introduced; since then, tradition has been for seniors to parade around the campus, carrying and linked by the chain. The mountain laurel represents the bay laurel used by the Romans in wreaths and crowns of honor. At Reed College in Portland, Oregon, United States, members of the senior class receive laurel wreaths upon submitting their senior thesis in May. The tradition stems from the use of laurel wreaths in athletic competitions; the seniors have \\"crossed the finish line,\\" so to speak. At St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, students who successfully complete three years of one classical language and two of the other earn the distinction of the Classics Diploma and the honor of wearing a laurel wreath on Prize Day. In Sweden, those receiving a doctorate or an honorary doctorate at the Faculty of Philosophy (meaning philosophy, languages, arts, history and social sciences), receive a laurel wreath during the ceremony of conferral of the degree. In Finland, in University of Helsinki a laurel wreath is given during the ceremony of conferral for master's degree. Doctors wear a special kind of Doctoral hat.  Architectural and decorative arts motif  Alexander Garden Grille The laurel wreath is a common motif in architecture, furniture, and textiles. The laurel wreath is seen carved in the stone and decorative plaster works of Robert Adam, and in Federal, Regency, Directoire, and Beaux-Arts periods of architecture. In decorative arts, especially during the Empire period, the laurel wreath is seen woven in textiles, inlaid in marquetry, and applied to furniture in the form of gilded brass mounts. Alfa Romeo added a laurel wreath to their logo after they won the inaugural Automobile World Championship in 1925 with the P2 racing car.  As used in heraldry  CNT Laurel wreaths are sometimes used in heraldry. They may be used as a charge in the shield, around the shield, or on top of it like an annular form. Wreaths are a form of headgear akin to circlets. In heraldry, a twisted band of cloth holds a mantling onto a helmet. This type of charge is called a \\"torse\\". A wreath is a circlet of foliage, usually with leaves, but sometimes with flowers. Laurel wreaths are used the arms of a territorial branch. Wreaths may also be made from oak leaves, flowers, holly and rosemary; and are different from chaplets. While usually annular, they may also be penannular like a brooch.  Wreath of service  Wreath of Service The \\"wreath of service\\" is located on all commissioner position patches in the Boy Scouts of America. This is a symbol for the service rendered to units and the continued partnership between volunteers and professional Scouter. The wreath of service represents commitment to program and unit service.

It is a region of rugged terrain with dramatic cliffs and waterfalls, and contains the geographical centre of the continent. Background The origins of the park date to 13 September 1910 when the vice president of Mato Grosso, Colonel Pedro Celestino Corrêa da Costa, concerned about the devastation of vegetation in the headwaters of the Coxipó-açu, Manso and Cuiabá rivers, declared that the area was one of public utility. In 1984 a coalition of environmentalists, artists and intellectuals in the state launched a petition to protest against the act of the government in creating a tourist complex nearby. In February 1986 a national campaign was launched by NGOs to ask president José Sarney to create the national park. This finally took place three years later. Location The park was created on 12 April 1989 by Law 97.656, with . It lies in the municipalities of Cuiabá and Chapada dos Guimarães. The purpose is to protect significant samples of the local ecosystems and to ensure the preservation of natural and archaeological sites, while supporting appropriate use for visiting, education and research. The park is in the Pantanal Biosphere Reserve, which also includes the Pantanal, Emas and Serra da Bodoquena national parks, and the Serra de Santa Bárbara and Nascentes do Rio Taquari, Pantanal de Rio Negro state parks. The park is in the basin of the upper Paraguay River, protecting the headwaters of the Cuiabá River, one of the main feeders of the Mato Grosso Pantanal. Chapada is a Brazilian word that means a region of steep cliffs, usually at the edge of a plateau. The geographical center of South America, formerly considered to be in the city of Cuiabá where it is marked by a white marble obelisk, is in fact located in the park near the town of Chapado dos Guimarães at the \\"Mirante de Geodésia\\", a scenic lookout point. Environment The climate is tropical, with temperatures ranging from and annual rainfall of . The rain falls mostly in spring and summer, with a little rain in autumn and winter. The terrain of the park is characterized by large hills and red sandstone cliffs ranging from in height. Visitor attractions include mountain peaks, waterfalls and caves. Fauna include jaguar, pampas deer, howler monkey, tapir, giant anteater, giant armadillo, maned wolf, greater rhea (known as an ema) and seriema. Parrots, swifts and red macaws nest in the sandstone cliffs. The park is threatened by fire in the cold, dry and windy period of the year, often caused by human activities near or in the park. Lightning does not seem to be an important cause, since it is usually followed by rain.

The school was named after Captain Mortimer Harvie Jordan, a war hero who lost his life in World War I. He was a soldier, officer and physician. As commanding officer of Company K, 167th infantry, 42nd \\"Rainbow Division\\" Alabama Army National Guard, he was mortally wounded while leading his sector in battle. He died of his wounds in 1918 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.ArlingtonCemetery.net: Capt. Mortimer H. Jordan  Student profile  Enrollment in grades 9-12 for the 2012-13 school year is 757 students. Approximately 91% of students are European-American 7% are African-American, and 2% are other races/ethnicites. Roughly 29% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. MJHS has a graduation rate of 95%. Approximately 87% of its students meet or exceed proficiency standards in mathematics, while 92% meet or exceed standards in reading. The average ACT score for MJHS students is 24 and the average SAT composite is 1640. Foundation Mortimer Jordan High School opened its doors in the fall of 1920 at its original campus in Morris, Alabama with a mere ninety students enrolled. Two students, Ms. Sudie Counts Rogers and Ms. Eileen Jenkins Lovelady, graduated that year. The first principal, Ms. Minnie Holliman, and three female teachers completed the faculty. In 1928, a student, Ms. Mabel Creel graduated valedictorian at the age of 13. She was the youngest to graduate with such high honors. Craig Kanaday is the seventh and current principal of MJHS. Improvements The original facility was located in Morris, with the property directly adjacent to the city limits of Kimberly. This site was occupied until the end of the 2010-11 school year. The original building of five rooms soon became inadequate and a frame building of eight rooms was added. The first water system for the school was installed during the early 1930s. Alabama By-Product Corporation in Majestic donated the pump and water filter to the school using Turkey Creek as the water source. A teacher and some students installed the system, and water fountains were placed outside the building. Between the years of 1937 and 1941 indoor plumbing and restrooms were installed. The \\"old gym\\" was built by the WPA during 1936 and 1937, around the same time the lunchroom program was established. The first Miss Mortimer Jordan, now Miss Torch, was elected in 1937. Stage curtains were purchased for the gym stage with the proceeds from the pageant. During the early 1950s, a then up-to-date football and athletic field was constructed. Restrooms in the football stadium were added in 1962. During the 1960s, Gardendale High School was established south of Morris in Gardendale. Until that time, students in the Gardendale area attended Mortimer Jordan High School. Gardendale based students were phased out in the mid-to-late 1960s. MJ senior high school students from Gardendale were allowed to finish senior high school at Mortimer Jordan if they desired or could transfer to Gardendale. Many chose to finish at MJ. Buses to MJ ran routes through Gardendale for several years concurrent with buses to Gardendale until the phase out was completed in 1968-69. In its last incarnation at the Morris site, the school consisted of a multi-complex that included two gymnasiums, academic classrooms, and a lunchroom. A music department (band and choir), homemaking department, business education department, and student counseling service were added. A brand new Mortimer Jordan High School was built on Bone Dry Road, approximately four miles from the old site. It opened in the fall of 2011. The new site, one of a series of new high schools built during the period by the Jefferson County Schools, consists of classroom buildings, an athletics field house, and two fields for football, baseball and softball. A competition and a practice gymnasium, as well as greatly enlarged practice facilities for wrestling, are also included. The original site in Morris was converted into the William E. Burkett Center for handicapped students; the W.E.B.C. moved from its original location near Fultondale to the original MJHS campus at the beginning of the 2012-13 school year. Sports The athletic department fields teams in football, volleyball, cross country, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, golf, soccer, tennis, and track and field. The softball team won the Alabama High School Athletic Association Class 5A State Championship in 2008 and 2009, setting a state record in 2009 for most consecutive games won. That streak carried over into the 2010 season, and ended at 59 games when Jordan lost to Angelo Rodriguez High School of Fairfield, California in the ESPN RISE/Nike Fastest to First Tournament in Huntington Beach, California on March 25, 2010. (The team later finished second in the 2010 5A championship, upset by Athens High twice on the final day.) Jordan also won the 2011 championship, only the fourth team in state history to win a title after losing their opening game in the double-elimination tournament. The softball program won its first state championship with the 1999 4A-5A title. It also has five second-place finishes.http://www.ahsaa.com/Sports/Softball/Softball-Past-State-Champions Mortimer Jordan also has one basketball state championship from 1928.http://www.ahsaa.com/Sports/Basketball/Basketball-Past-State-Champions The football program was the 5A runner-up in 2015, playing in its first AHSAA Super 7 appearance at Bryant–Denny Stadium.

He studied law at the University of Iowa College of Law in Iowa City, and was admitted to the bar in 1890, commencing practice in Wahoo, Nebraska. At age 27, Perky moved west in 1894 to Albion, Idaho, and was district judge of the fourth judicial district of Idaho in 1901. He moved to Boise and continued the practice of law. Following the death of Weldon B. Heyburn in 1912, Perky was appointed to the vacant U.S. Senate seat by Governor James H. Hawley. A Democrat, he served less than three months, from November 18, 1912, to February 5, 1913, when a successor was elected, James H. Brady. Perky resumed the practice of law in Boise, and moved to California in 1923, and continued the practice of law in Los Angeles until his death at age 71 in 1939 at Good Samaritan Hospital.

It suggested that the Earth had been in a molten state, and features such as mountains formed as it cooled and shrank.The History of Continental Drift - Before Wegener As the interior of the Earth cooled and shrank, the rigid crust would have to shrink and crumple. The crumpling could produce features such as mountain ranges.  Application  The Earth was compared to a cooling ball of iron, or a steam boiler with shifting boiler plates. By the early 1900s, it was known that temperature increased with increasing depth. With the thickness of the crust, the \\"boiler plates\\", being estimated at ten to fifty miles, the downward pressure would be hundreds of thousands of pounds per square inch. Although groundwater was expected to turn to steam at a great depth, usually the downward pressure would contain any steam. Steam's effect upon molten rock was suspected of being a cause of volcanoes and earthquakes, as it had been noticed that most volcanoes are near water. It was not clear whether the molten rock from volcanoes had its origin in the molten rock under the crust, or if increased heat due to pressure under mountains caused the rock to melt. One of the reasons for volcanoes was as a way in which \\"the contracting earth disposes of the matter it can no longer contain.\\" A relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes had been noted, although the causes were not known. Fault lines and earthquakes tended to happen along the boundaries of the shifting \\"boiler plates\\", but the folding of mountains indicated that sometimes the plates buckled. In the early 1900s, Professor Eduard Suess used the theory to explain the 1908 Messina earthquake, being of the opinion that the Earth's crust was gradually shrinking everywhere. He also predicted that eruptions would follow the earthquake and tsunami in Southern Italy. He attributed the earthquake to the sinking of the Earth's crust, in the zone of which the Aeolian Islands are the center. He declared that as the process of sinking went on, the Calabrian and Sicilian highlands on either side of the Straits of Messina would be submerged, only the highest peaks remaining above the sea. The strait, he said, would thereby be greatly widened. Similarly, Professor Robert T. Hill explained at that time that \\"the rocks are being folded, fractured and otherwise broken or deformed by the great shrinking and settling of the earth's crust as a whole. The contraction of the earth's sphere is the physical shrinkage of age that is measured in aeons instead of years. The prehistoric convulsions of the earth before man inhabited this planet were terrific, almost inconceivable.\\" There \\"was no doubt that earthquakes are diminishing.\\" The displacement of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was only a few feet, while prehistoric earthquakes made fissures and slides of 20,000 feet. 1906 map of earthquake regions The Pacific Ring of Fire had been noticed, as well as a second earthquake belt which went through: * the Philippines * Panama * the Caribbean * Spain * the Alps * the Himalayas * Asia to Japan A contracting Earth served as framework for Leopold Kober and Hans Stille who worked on geosyncline theory in the first half of the 20th century.Şengör (1982), p. 23  Objections  Some of the objections include: * Some large-scale features of the Earth are the result of extension rather than shortening. * After radioactive decay was discovered, it was realized it would release heat inside the planet. This undermines the cooling effect upon which the shrinking planet theory is based. *Identical fossils have been found thousands of kilometres apart, showing the planet was once a single continent which broke apart because of plate tectonics.  Current status  This theory is now disproven and considered obsolete. In contrast to Earth, however, global cooling remains the dominant explanation for scarp (cliff) features on the planet Mercury. After resumption of Lunar exploration in the 1990s, it was discovered there are scarps across the Moon's surface which are caused by contraction due to cooling.

This is commonly tested when investigating the safety of aircraft and vehicles. Depending on the nature of the impact and the vehicle involved, different criteria are used to determine the crashworthiness of the structure. Crashworthiness may be assessed either prospectively, using computer models (e.g., LS-DYNA, PAM-CRASH, MSC Dytran, MADYMO) or experiments, or retrospectively by analyzing crash outcomes. Several criteria are used to assess crashworthiness prospectively, including the deformation patterns of the vehicle structure, the acceleration experienced by the vehicle during an impact, and the probability of injury predicted by human body models. Injury probability is defined using criteria, which are mechanical parameters (e.g., force, acceleration, or deformation) that correlate with injury risk. A common injury criterion is the Head impact criterion (HIC). Crashworthiness is assessed retrospectively by analyzing injury risk in real-world crashes, often using regression or other statistical techniques to control for the myriad of confounders that are present in crashes. History=Aviation The history of human tolerance to deceleration can likely trace its beginning in the studies by John Stapp to investigate the limits of human tolerance in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pakistan Army began serious accident analysis into crashworthiness as a result of fixed-wing and rotary- wing accidents. As the US Army's doctrine changed, helicopters became the primary mode of transportation in Vietnam. Pilots were receiving spinal injuries in otherwise survivable crashes due to decelerative forces on the spine and fires. Work began to develop energy absorbing seats to reduce the chance of spinal injuriesThe Evolution of Energy Absorption Systems for Crashworthy Helicopter Seats by Stan Desjardins, paper at 59th AHS Forum during training and combat in Vietnam. Heavy research was conducted into human tolerance, energy attenuation and structural designs that would protect the occupants of military helicopters.Human Tolerance and Crash Survival - Shanahan (NATO) The primary reason is that ejection or exiting a helicopter is impractical given the rotor system and typical altitude at which Army helicopters fly. In the late 1960s the Army published the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide.Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide Volume 1 The guide was revised several times and became a multi-volume set divided by aircraft systems. The intent of this guide is to assist engineers in understanding the design considerations important to crash-resistant military aircraft. Consequently, the Army established a military standard (MIL-STD-1290A) for light fixed and rotary-wing aircraft.Military Standard for Light Fixed and Rotary-Wing Aircraft The standard establishes minimum requirements for crash safety for human occupants based on the need to maintain a livable volume or space and the reduction of decelerative loads upon the occupant.Aircraft Crashworthiness Research Program - FAA Crashworthiness was greatly improved in the 1970s with the fielding of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and the Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. Primary crash injuries were reduced, but secondary injuries within the cockpit continued to occur. This led to the consideration of additional protective devices such as airbags. Airbags were considered a viable solution to reducing the incidents of head strikes in the cockpit, and were incorporated in Army helicopters. Regulatory agencies The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the Department of Defense have been the leading proponents for crash safety in the United States. They have each developed their own authoritative safety requirements and conducted extensive research and development in the field.

A growler consists of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core and connected to a source of alternating current. When placed on the armature or stator core of a motor the growler acts as the primary of a transformer and the armature coils act as the secondary. A \\"feeler\\", a thin strip of steel (hacksaw blade) can be used as the short detector. Motor testing The alternating magnetic flux set up by the growler passes through the windings of the armature coil, generating an alternating voltage in the coil. A short in the coil creates a closed circuit that will act like the secondary coil of a transformer, with the growler acting like the primary coil. This will induce an alternating current in the shorted armature that will in turn cause an alternating magnetic field to encircle the shorted armature coil. A flat, broad, flexible piece of metal containing iron is used to detect the magnetic field generated by a shorted armature. A hacksaw blade is commonly used as a feeler. The alternating magnetic field induced by a shorted armature is strong at the surface of the armature, and when the feeler is lightly touched to the iron core of an armature winding, small currents are induced in the feeler that generate a third alternating magnetic field surrounding the feeler. With the growler energized, the feeler is moved from slot to slot. When the feeler is moved over a slot containing the shorted coil, the alternating magnetic field will alternately attract and release the feeler, causing it to vibrate in synch with the alternating current. A strong vibration of the feeler accompanied by a growling noise indicated that the coil is shorted. Other uses Along with the standard application the growler can be used: * to test series and interpoles (commutating) fields from a DC motor * to determine phasing and polarity in multiwinding armatures * to test rotors in rotating frequency changers, as well as in wound rotors * to test shorts between turns in taped coils before installation into an armature or a stator * as a low voltage isolation transformer * as a high voltage autotransformer bucking or boosting for numerous tests on various types of equipment * for preheating or baking armatures and rotors.

(1928) \\"Etude des oscillations entretenues,\\" Revue générale de l'électricité 23, pp. 901–912 and 946–954. is a second order differential equation, named after the French physicist Alfred-Marie Liénard. During the development of radio and vacuum tube technology, Liénard equations were intensely studied as they can be used to model oscillating circuits. Under certain additional assumptions Liénard's theorem guarantees the uniqueness and existence of a limit cycle for such a system. Definition Let f and g be two continuously differentiable functions on R, with g an odd function and f an even function. Then the second order ordinary differential equation of the form :{d^2x \\\\over dt^2}+f(x){dx \\\\over dt}+g(x)=0 is called the Liénard equation. Liénard system The equation can be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We define :F(x) := \\\\int_0^x f(\\\\xi) d\\\\xi :x_1:= x :x_2:={dx \\\\over dt} + F(x) then : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{x}_1 \\\\ \\\\dot{x}_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{h}(x_1, x_2) := \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_2 - F(x_1) \\\\ -g(x_1) \\\\end{bmatrix} is called a Liénard system. Alternatively, since Liénard equation itself is also an autonomous differential equation, the substitution v = {dx \\\\over dt} leads the Liénard equation to become a first order differential equation: :v{dv \\\\over dx}+f(x)v+g(x)=0 which belongs to Abel equation of the second kind.Liénard equation at eqworld.Abel equation of the second kind at eqworld. Example The Van der Pol oscillator :{d^2x \\\\over dt^2}-\\\\mu(1-x^2){dx \\\\over dt} +x= 0 is a Liénard equation. The solution of a Van der Pol oscillator has a limit cycle. Such cycle has a solution of a Liénard equation with negative f(x) at small x and positive f(x) otherwise. The Van der Pol equation has no exact, analytic solution.

Overview Software system safety is a subset of system safety and system engineering and is synonymous with the software engineering aspects of Functional Safety. As part of the total safety and software development program, software cannot be allowed to function independently of the total effort. Both simple and highly integrated multiple systems are experiencing an extraordinary growth in the use of computers and software to monitor and/or control safety-critical subsystems or functions. A software specification error, design flaw, or the lack of generic safety-critical requirements can contribute to or cause a system failure or erroneous human decision. To achieve an acceptable level of safety for software used in critical applications, software system safety engineering must be given primary emphasis early in the requirements definition and system conceptual design process. Safety-critical software must then receive continuous management emphasis and engineering analysis throughout the development and operational lifecycles of the system. Functional Hazard Analyses (FHA) are often conducted early on - in parallel with or as part of system engineering Functional Analyses - to determine the safety-critical functions (SCF) of the systems for further analyses and verification. Software system safety is directly related to the more critical design aspects and safety attributes in software and system functionality, whereas software quality attributes are inherently different and require standard scrutiny and development rigor. Development Assurance levels (DAL) and associated Level of Rigor (LOR) is a graded approach to software quality and software design assurance as a pre-requisite that a suitable software process is followed for confidence. LOR concepts and standards such as DO-178C are NOT a substitute for software safety. Software safety per IEEE STD-1228 and MIL-STD-882E focuses on ensuring explicit safety requirements are met and verified using functional approaches from a safety requirements analysis and test perspective. Software safety hazard analysis required for more complex systems where software is controlling critical functions generally are in the following sequential categories and are conducted in phases as part of the system safety or safety engineering process: software safety requirements analysis; software safety design analyses (top level, detailed design and code level); software safety test analysis, and software safety change analysis. Once these \\"functional\\" software safety analyses are completed the software engineering team will know where to place safety emphasis and what functional threads, functional paths, domains and boundaries to focus on when designing in software safety attributes to ensure correct functionality and to detect malfunctions, failures, faults and to implement a host of mitigation strategies to control hazards. Software security and various software protection technologies are similar to software safety attributes in the design to mitigate various types of threats vulnerability and risks. Deterministic software is sought in the design by verifying correct and predictable behavior at the system level.  Goals  * Functional safety is achieved through engineering development to ensure correct execution and behavior of software functions as intended * Safety consistent with mission requirements, is designed into the software in a timely, cost effective manner. * On complex systems involving many interactions safety-critical functionality should be identified and thoroughly analyzed before deriving hazards and design safeguards for mitigations. * Safety-critical functions lists and preliminary hazards lists should be determined proactively and influence the requirements that will be implemented in software. *Contributing factors and root causes of faults and resultant hazards associated with the system and its software are identified, evaluated and eliminated or the risk reduced to an acceptable level, throughout the lifecycle. *Reliance on administrative procedures for hazard control is minimized. *The number and complexity of safety critical interfaces is minimized. *The number and complexity of safety critical computer software components is minimized. *Sound human engineering principles are applied to the design of the software-user interface to minimize the probability of human error. *Failure modes, including hardware, software, human and system are addressed in the design of the software. *Sound software engineering practices and documentation are used in the development of the software. *Safety issues and safety attributes are addressed as part of the software testing effort at all levels. *Software is designed for human machine interface, ease of maintenance and modification or enhancement *Software with safety-critical functionality must be thoroughly verified with objective analysis and preferably test evidence that all safety requirements have been met per established criteria.

He grew up in Wee Waa and started learning the instrument at age five from his grandfather and other Wiradjuri elders. His signature instrument was over a hundred years old and was made from a blood wood eucalypt. He received his secondary education at St Pius X High School, Newcastle. Dargin worked as a busker on the streets of Sydney. He appeared with various symphony orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall; as well as in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In 1983 Dargin appeared in a five- part ABC-TV miniseries, Chase Through the Night, alongside Nicole Kidman. He had the role of Bruce in the feature film, The Fringe Dwellers (1986), and a cameo appearance in The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert (1994), as an unnamed cross-dresser. On Bastille Day in 1994 he performed for the French President, François Mitterrand. He has contributed to albums by other artists: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Jimmy Barnes, Tommy Emmanuel, Wallis Buchanan (Jamiroquai), Yothu Yindi, Alison Brown and Don Burrows, and filmed a documentary about Cape York with Jacques Cousteau. Dargin's last recording, MRD, contains tracks that feature collaborations with musicians: Tommy Emmanuel, James Morrison, supplying didgeridoo in duet with other instruments: guitar, steel drums, keyboard, Chinese flute, trumpet, electric bass, and voice. The album was released in April 2008. Dargin held a degree in science from the University of Toronto. Dargin was diagnosed with burst veins in his throat and was warned by doctors that continued playing of the didgeridoo to generate a \\"fast, complex and loud sound\\" in \\"his forceful style\\" could endanger his life. In mid-February 2008 he was admitted to Saint Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, and died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 24 February 2008. A memorial service was held at Circular Quay on 28 February in that year, commencing with a traditional Aboriginal smoking ceremony that progressed along the quay to First Fleet Park.

The station was notable at its launch for having been among the fastest radio stations to sign-on after being awarded a construction permit. WTOD's initial staff was composed largely of veterans returning from World War II.\\"WTOD on air June 15, three months after CP.\\" eBroadcasting - Telecasting, June 24, 1946, pg. 58.

The VVA-14 was designed by Italian-born designer Robert Bartini in answer to a perceived requirement to destroy United States Navy Polaris missile submarines. The final aircraft was retired in 1987. Development Bartini, in collaboration with the Beriev Design Bureau intended to develop the prototype VVA-14 in three phases. The VVA-14M1 was to be an aerodynamics and technology testbed, initially with rigid pontoons on the ends of the central wing section, and later with these replaced by inflatable pontoons. The VVA-14M2 was to be more advanced, with two starting engines to blast into the cavity under the wing to give lift and later with a battery of lift engines to give VTOL capability, and with fly-by-wire flight controls. The VVA-14M3 would see the VTOL vehicle fully equipped with armament and with the Burevestnik computerised anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system, Bor-1 magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) and other operational equipment. Operational history After extensive research, including the development of the small prototype Be-1 wing in ground effect aircraft, the first VVA-14 prototype was completed in 1972. Its first flight was from a conventional runway on 4 September 1972. In 1974, the inflatable pontoons were installed, though their operation caused many problems. Flotation and water taxi tests followed, culminating in the start of flight testing of the amphibious aircraft on 11 June 1975. The inflatable pontoons were later replaced by rigid pontoons, while the fuselage was lengthened and the starting engines added. This incarnation was given the designation 14M1P. However, the bureau supplying the intended battery of 12 RD-36-35PR lift engines did not deliver, and this made VTOL testing impossible.*Komissarov, Sergey. “Russia's Ekranoplans”. Hinkley. Midland Publishing. 2002. After Bartini's death in 1974, the project slowed and eventually drew to a close, the aircraft having conducted 107 flights, with a total flight time of 103 hours. The only remaining VVA-14, No. 19172, was retired to the Soviet Central Air Force Museum, Moscow in 1987.

The hem, which can be cuffed or un-cuffed, is around above the knee. They are so-named because of their popularity in Bermuda, a British Overseas Territory, where they are considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like material and worn with knee-length socks, a dress shirt, tie, and blazer. True Bermuda shorts are not to be confused with \\"capri pants\\" extending below the knee. Cargo shorts may be a similar length but are typically baggy or less \\"tailored\\" than Bermuda shorts and more typical of West Coast American fashion. History The invention of Bermuda shorts is attributed to native Bermudian and tea shop owner Nathaniel Coxon, who in 1914 hemmed the uniform pants of his employees allowing for more comfort in the heat. The British Army, stationed in Bermuda during World War I, adopted the shorts for wear in tropical and desert climates. Bermuda shorts became a popular sportswear item in the 1920s and 1930s for their association with leisure and tropical vacations. Their name was likely codified in the United States by The Bermuda Shop, a New York City sportswear retailer. According to Jack Lightbourn, former Executive Vice President of the Bank of Bermuda, the general managers of the two banks in Bermuda, The Bank of Bermuda Ltd and The Bank of N.T. Butterfield and Sons Ltd were concerned that their male employees would not have suitable clothing to wear due to clothing shortages related to World War II. They arranged for a local tailor to make two pairs of shorts, modeled on the shorts of the British military, for each of their male employees. The shorts were made from a very itchy grey flannel material, and each employee was supplied with two pairs of heavy grey wool long socks to wear with the shorts. This was the beginning of Bermuda shorts as business attire in Bermuda as well as the pairing of long socks with Bermuda shorts. In the post-war period local merchants such as Trimingham Bros. and H.A. & E. Smiths improved the design of the shorts and used bright coloured materials as the shorts became more popular. Vogue first used the term \\"Bermuda shorts\\" in 1948. The rise in the popularity of the shorts coincides with the broader rise in acceptability of shorts as daily wear. Along with jeans, Bermuda shorts were prohibited for female students at Penn State University until 1954, when the ban was lifted only for off-campus events. A piece from that year in The New Yorker mentions that although sales figures for the shorts at retailers such as Brooks Brothers were increasing, certain hotels and clubs still would not allow them. Bermuda shorts experienced renewed popularity in the 1970s due to increased interest in the fashion of the 1950s. They reappeared on the runways for several years starting in the early 1990s. The shorts remained popular within girl's and junior's fashion through the mid-2000s. Uses Bermuda shortsare considered more appropriate in hot subtropical and tropical climates than the typical heavier clothing favored in Europe. Many businesses in the West today that have a business casual policy similarly allow this kind of clothing in the hotter seasons, especially in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Bermuda shorts are part of the attire for the British Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy. During the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics, Bermuda's delegation traditionally wears red Bermuda shorts (red being the primary color in the country's flag).

Because changes in the Earth's orbit affect the amount and distribution of sunlight the Earth receives, such changes are expected to introduce periodic climate changes on time scales of 20-100 kyr. Long records of sedimentation or climate should record such variations; however, such records often have poorly constrained age scales. As a result, scientists will sometimes adjust the timing of the features in their records to match the predictions of orbital theory in the hopes of improving the dating accuracy.

According to the DSM-IV, DD-NOS encompasses \\"any depressive disorder that does not meet the criteria for a specific disorder.\\" In the DSM-5, it is called unspecified depressive disorder. Examples of disorders in this category include those sometimes described as minor depressive disorder and recurrent brief depression. \\"Depression\\" refers to a spectrum of disturbances in mood that vary from mild to severe and from short periods to constant illness. DD-NOS is diagnosed if a patients symptoms fail to meet the criteria more common depressive disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Although DD-NOS shares similar symptoms to dysthymia, dysthymia is classified by a period of at least 2 years of constantly recurring depressed mood, where as DD-NOS is classified by much shorter periods of depressed moods. For most people who suffer the condition, their life will be significantly affected. DD-NOS can make many aspects of a person's daily life difficult to manage, inhibiting their ability to enjoy the things that used to make them happy. Sufferers of the disorder tend to isolate themselves from their friends and families, lose interest in some activities, and experience behavioural changes and sleeping disorders. Some sufferers also experience suicidal tendencies or suicide attempts. In addition to having these symptoms, a diagnosis of DD-NOS will only be made if the symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For the diagnosis to be accurate, a psychiatrist is required to spend extensive time with the patient. Symptoms of the disorder may arise due to several reasons. These include: * Distress due to medical conditions * Environmental effects and situations However, the effects of drugs or medication or bereavement are not classified under the diagnosis. A person will not be diagnosed with the condition if they have or have had any of the following: a major depressive episode, manic episode, mixed episode or hypomanic episode. A diagnosis of the disorder will look like: \\"Depressive Disorder NOS 311\\". Concerns Accurately assessing for a specific Depressive Disorder diagnosis requires an expenditure of time that is deemed unreasonable for most primary care physicians. For this reason, physicians often use this code as a proxy for a more thorough diagnosis. There is concern that this may lead to a \\"wastebasket\\" mindset for certain disorders. In addition reimbursement through Medicare may be lower for certain non specific diagnosis. Treatment It is possible for this disorder to progress over time. A patient suffering from the disorder can improve the condition with treatments. There are several types of therapies that may improve the condition, but depending on a patient's experience of the disorder or the cause of the disorder, treatments will vary. *Psychotherapy including behaviour therapy, Gestalt therapy, Adlerian therapy, psychoanalytic therapy and existential therapy. *Pharmacotherapy through medications including antidepressants.

She was wanted for the murder of her potential roommate, Beverly McGowan, a 34-year-old bank clerk. McGowan had placed an ad in the paper looking for a roommate. A woman named \\"Alice\\" answered the ad. The woman was actually Parent. Soon after, McGowan disappeared; on July 19, 1990, her remains were found in a rural canal in St. Lucie County, Florida. She had been mutilated by removing a tattoo on her stomach, her head and hands to hinder the identification of her corpse but a small tattoo was enough to identify her. According to investigators, Parent was known to have traveled around the world on more than 20 different identities and was a master of disguise, even at times posing as a man. The origin of Parent's nickname, the \\"Chameleon Killer,\\" was a photograph of an oil painting of herself she sent to police with the message \\"Best wishes: your Chameleon\\" typed on the back. The nickname was apt as she stole the identities of her victims and was found to have used McGowan's credit cards after she killed her. She also scoured graveyards for names and dates of birth and stole the information of other potential roommates by telling them she was a numerologist, soliciting their social security numbers, driver's licences and even birth certificates. When Florida police caught up with her in Panama City, Florida, on April 6, 2002, she committed suicide by shooting herself in the heart as they stood outside her bedroom door waiting for her to get dressed. There have been concerns that in her time on the run she is likely to have committed other crimes. Some investigators have even questioned if \\"Elaine Parent\\" was her actual, given name, since no birth certificate for her has ever been found. Beverly McGowan's murder and the search for Elaine Parent were profiled on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted. In 2014, she was featured on the Investigation Discovery program Swamp Murders.

The by-election was caused by the appointment of Donald Sumner, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington, as a county court judge. The appointment was generally thought to be making way for Peter Goldman, who had worked with Iain Macleod on the Conservatives' previous election manifesto. The Conservatives had held the seat since its creation in 1945 and, in the 1959 general election, had easily retained it. Labour and the Liberals had each picked up just over 20% of the vote. Commentators therefore expected Goldman to achieve a comfortable victory. The Liberal Party had reached its lowest ebb in the 1951 general election, gaining only 2.5% of the national vote and returning only six MPs. Signs of a revival were not seen until it won the 1958 Torrington by-election, its first gain at a by-election since Holland with Boston in 1929. The following year, however, Torrington was lost at the general election and, despite increasing its share of the vote to 5.9%, the party did not return more than six MPs. After the general election, its revival resumed as it took second place in several by-elections. The Liberals had planned to put forward their candidate from the 1959 election, Jack Galloway, but selected local councillor Eric Lubbock after it was revealed that Galloway had technically been guilty of bigamy. During the campaign, Goldman attracted criticism for living outside the constituency and admitting that he had no plans to move into it. His close association with the Exchequer also meant his standing was damaged when the Conservative government was forced to announce a pay freeze (Selwyn Lloyd's \\"Pay Pause\\") for public sector workers that was seen, in particular, to penalise nurses. The by-election was held on 14 March 1962.By- elections in British Politics ed. C.Cook & J.Ramsden, UCL Press, 1997. Despite the Conservatives' troubles, the near-22% swing from them to the Liberals surprised most analysts. Lubbock won a 7,855-vote majority and held the seat until 1970. The win boosted the Liberals' poll ratings but did not accelerate their resurgence.

She is the first cutter in Coast Guard history to hold this name. Like all ships in the Reliance class of 210-foot medium-endurance cutters, Dauntless is named for an aspirational trait, in this case meaning to \\"persevere fearlessly.\\" This trait is further reflected in the ship's motto Sin Miedo which, in Spanish, means \\"Without Fear.\\" Since her commissioning, Dauntless was homeported in Miami, Florida, until 1993, when she was decommissioned and entered Major Maintenance Availability (MMA) at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. After 18 months and at a total cost of $21 million, the ship was completely overhauled from stem to stern. The major renovations included the addition of an engine exhaust stack aft of the pilot house, a complete powerplant overhaul, installation of new navigation and communications systems, and extensive habitability improvements. After MMA, Dauntless was assigned to her new homeport of Galveston, Texas. In July 2018, Dauntless arrived at her newly assigned homeport of Pensacola, Florida. Dauntless has earned a reputation as one of the nation's premier \\"drug busters.\\" Dauntless became the first cutter in history to seize one million pounds of marijuana, an accomplishment signified by a large gold marijuana leaf painted on her superstructure. During her Coast Guard career, Dauntless has over 85 illegal narcotics \\"busts\\" to her credit, more than any other cutter. She has also played a leading role in search and rescue (SAR) operations. During the mass Cuban exodus (see Mariel boatlift) between April 23 and May 13, 1980, over 25 vessels were towed to safety, eight persons adrift at sea were rescued, and an astonishing 55 SAR cases were conducted. The ship's most- publicized case occurred during January 1986, when Dauntless was first to arrive and served as on-scene commander (until relieved by USCGC Dallas) for the response to the space shuttle Challenger disaster. On November 24, 1995, Dauntless rescued 578 migrants from a grossly overloaded 75-foot coastal freighter, the largest number of migrants rescued from a single vessel in Coast Guard history. Since relocating to Galveston, Dauntless has proudly performed her primary missions of law enforcement, alien migrant interdiction operations, protection of marine resources, SAR, and more recently homeland defense in the Gulf of Mexico. Operational highlights include the four \\"drug busts\\" resulting in over 3,000 pounds of illegal drugs seized; and the September 2001 rescue of a young commercial mariner from Louisiana who had fallen overboard from the vessel on which he was working, and was successfully located and returned to his ship. Since the events of September 11, 2001, Dauntless has conducted several patrols dedicated to enhancing port security in the Gulf of Mexico. The cutter's awards include the Coast Guard Unit Commendation (2), the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation (5), the Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation, the Coast Guard \\"E\\" ribbon (7), the National Defense Service Medal (3), and the Humanitarian Service Medal (3). President Ronald Reagan visited the cutter on November 17, 1982 and awarded her the Coast Guard Unit Commendation. It was the first time in 19 years that a President visited a Coast Guard cutter. In fiction Dauntless has appeared in two motion pictures: The Island, in which (portraying herself) she was boarded and seized by Caribbean pirates, and in the James Bond film Licence to Kill. In the 2016 novel Goliath by Shawn Corridan & Gary Waid, Dauntless along with Alex Haley are the two Coast Guard cutters that respond to the fire aboard and subsequent stranding of a Russian ULCC.

Heisson lies just north of Battle Ground Lake State Park, south of the East Fork Lewis River, and northeast of Battle Ground, Washington. It consists of a combined general store and post office, along with several houses. Among these houses is the Henry Heisen House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Washington. The post office is located adjacent to a crossing for the historic Chelatchie Prairie Railroad. History The area was named after German immigrant Alexander Heisen, and the \\"Heisson\\" spelling commonly used today is considered by some to be in error. Heisen and his family homesteaded in the area in 1866. The post office was founded in 1904, and Heisen granted land to the government for logging in exchange for having the post office named after him. However, the postal service recorded the name as \\"Heisson,\\" and it was recorded as thus on maps. Only the railroad retained use of the \\"Heisen\\" spelling. Current general store and post office signage, as well as current maps, use the modified spelling. Heisen's son built a home in the area, which is known as the Henry Heisen House and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is currently owned by Heisen House Vineyards.

Biology  Female adults lay translucent eggs singly on leaves of the host plant, mainly Vitis (grapes), and Parthenocissus (Virginia creeper). Caterpillars are large, green or red with a swollen third thorax segment into which the head and first two thoractic segments can be drawn. The abdomen has a small white spot on the second segment, and big white oval spots the last five spiracles. They also have the characteristic \\"horn\\" at the end of the abdomen, until it is replaced by a button in its last instar. Larvae consume copious amounts of foliage, and when they are ready they climb down their host plant and burrow underground, where they pupate. The pupa is dark brown in color, quite slender, and has a long cremaster. There the pupa will remain for either a couple of weeks or a couple of months, depending on the generation. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone plume.

He moved west to Cunningham, Washington, in 1907, to Ontario, Oregon, in 1910, and finally to Nampa, Idaho, in 1922. He engaged in the agriculture, livestock, feed and shipping businesses. Career In 1932, Gossett was elected to Idaho House of Representatives In 1936, he was elected the 22nd lieutenant governor, serving for two years alongside Governor Barzilla Clark. Gossett returned as the 24th lieutenant governor under Governor Chase Clark, Barzilla Clark's younger brother, both elected in 1940. Gossett was elected governor in his own right in 1944, winning the June primary over state auditor Calvin Wright and secretary of state George Curtis, and the November general election over William Detweiler, the Republican nominee from Hazelton. This was the last election for a two-year term, but Gossett served less than a year; he resigned in November 1945 to let his successor, Lieutenant Governor Arnold Williams, appoint him to the United States Senate to succeed the late John W. Thomas. In the special election for the seat in 1946, Gossett was defeated in the Democratic primary in June by state senator George Donart, who in turn was defeated by Republican congressman Henry Dworshak in the general election in November. After the loss, Gossett returned to his former business pursuits. Gossett attempted a political comeback in 1954 in a run for governor. At the time, self-succession (re-election) was not allowed, and Len Jordan's term was ending. Gossett was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in August by state senator Clark Hamilton, who in turn lost to Republican attorney general Robert Smylie in the general election. Gossett was appointed to the Idaho Tax Commission by Smylie in 1956 and served until 1967. Personal life Gossett married Clara Louise Fleming on November 28, 1916, and they had three children.

Emory and Henry similarly honored him in 1890 with the LL.D. degree, and Ohio Wesleyan University did the same in 1906. Ordained ministry Elijah was licensed to preach in the M.E. Church, South, at Jonesboro on 8 February 1866. He was admitted on trial to the Holston Annual Conference 29 September 1869, and was ordained in 1870. His first appointment was Jonesboro (Jonesborough United Methodist Church). The first person he received into church membership was his own father. He was then appointed to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1870. In July 1872 he transferred to California to the Pacific Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (M.E.C., S.). He was appointed to San Francisco. He then transferred to the Western North Carolina Annual Conference in 1875 and was appointed to Asheville. Academic and editorial ministries The Rev. Hoss became a professor at Martha Washington College (which later merged with Emory and Henry College) in 1876. He was elected president of this institution in 1879. He became a professor and vice president of Emory and Henry College in 1881 and was elected president in 1885. In August 1885 the Rev. Hoss was elected to the Chair of Ecclesiastical History, Church Polity and Pastoral Theology at Vanderbilt University, serving there until 1890. In May 1890 Rev. Hoss was elected the editor of the Nashville Christian Advocate, the primary weekly newspaper of the M.E. Church, South. He held this position until his election to the Episcopacy in 1902.Horace Mellard Du Bose, Holland Nimmons McTyeire, A History of Methodism, p. 162 (Publishing house of the M. E. church, South, 1916). Excerpt available at Google Books. Previous to this, he was a delegate to five general conferences of his denomination. The final time elected, he lacked only six votes in the Holston Conference, besides his own, of being unanimously elected. Episcopal ministry The Rev. Dr. Elijah Embree Hoss was elected to the Episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, by the 1902 General Conference. His Episcopal Residence was at 810 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee. Bishop Hoss was a fraternal representative of his denomination to nearly every Methodist Church in the world. His last great mission of this kind was to Australia in 1915. He was the presiding bishop of the M.E. South work in Brazil from 1905 to 1908 and in the Orient in 1910 and 1915. Retirement, death, and burial Bishop Hoss was given a year's vacation in 1914–15. He retired on account of feeble health in 1918. He died 23 April 1919 in Muskogee, Oklahoma, at the home of his son, Henry. He was buried in Muskogee beside his wife. They were re-interred together in Maple Lawn Cemetery at Jonesboro, Tennessee, 12 April 1924.

Background The festival was founded in 1956 by Pablo Casals. It was promoted by Teodoro Moscoso and David Ogilvy with the objectives of changing the image of Puerto Rico and promoting tourism to the island during off-peak tourism time. After implementing Operation Bootstrap, Teodoro Moscoso employed advertiser David Ogilvy to propagate the image of a people engaged in a cultural renaissance. Teodoro Moscoso's decisive actions at critical junctures (such as his success in pushing tax exemptions and tourism in the late 1940s) and his personal persuasiveness, as with Pablo Casals, who at the age of 80 was persuaded to establish the Casals Festival at San Juan. Pablo Casals Pablo Casals (1876–1973), was born in Spain to a Puerto Rican mother Pilar Defilló. He was a cello player and a supporter of the Spanish Republican Government and as such came to odds with Generalisimo Francisco Franco when the Spanish Republican Government was overthrown. Casals went to live in the French village of Prades. There he established the Prades Festival. Casals visited Puerto Rico in 1955 and in 1956 In 1956, Casals moved permanently to the island. He was scheduled to inaugurate the festival which bears his name. The inauguration of the festival was held in the University of Puerto Rico Theater. Casals, who was supposed to perform Suite Number 3 in C major, for solo cello by Johann Sebastian Bach, fell ill and suffered a heart attack during the rehearsals. Even though Casals was hospitalized, the event went on as scheduled with the performance of pianist Rudolf Serkin. When the festival first started, the majority of the musicians contracted by the festival orchestra for the event came from the United States. Some of the exceptions to this practice were Jesús María Sanromá, Henry Hutchinson Sr., Fernando Valenti and Narciso Figueroa and his brothers. By 1970, the majority of the members of the festival's orchestra were Puerto Ricans. Participants Amongst the musical directors who have participated in the festival besides Casals are Mstislav Rostropovich, Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta, Eugene Ormandy, Sir John Barbirolli, Yehudi Menuhin and recently Krzysztof Penderecki. The artistic direccion of the festival has been under the following \\"maestros\\" at one time or another: Jorge Mester, Odón Alonso, Mstislav Rostropovich, Krzysztof Penderecki, Elías López Sobá, Justino Diaz and presently under Maximiano Valdés. The Casals Festival today Pablo Casals died on October 22, 1973. His widow Marta Casals who was the president of the musical committee and Co‑Chairman of the Board and Music Director until 1979, undertook to continue the annual event. The festival has now taken on a new dimension with the appointment of pianist and scholar Elías López-Sobá and bass/baritone Justino Díaz as artistic and musical directors. These two Puerto Rican artists have continued to follow the legacy of Pablo and Marta Casals, attracting many musicians for a series of concerts. The festival which is now held at the Luis A. Ferre Performing Arts Center in San Juan, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006 with a performance of the Philadelphia Orchestra under the musical direction of Maestro Christoph Eschenbach. The Prades Festival established by Casals in France in 1950 was renamed the Pablo Casals Festival in 1982.

A TCU generally uses sensors from the vehicle as well as data provided by the engine control unit (ECU) to calculate how and when to change gears in the vehicle for optimum performance, fuel economy and shift quality.Transmission Control Module Definition  History  Electronic automatic transmissions have been changing in design from purely hydromechanical controls to electronic controls since the late 1980s. Since then, development has been iterative and today designs exist from several stages of electronic automatic transmission control development. Transmission solenoids are a key component to these control units. The evolution of the modern automatic transmission and the integration of electronic controls have allowed great progress in recent years. The modern automatic transmission is now able to achieve better fuel economy, reduced engine emissions, greater shift system reliability, improved shift feel, improved shift speed and improved vehicle handling. The immense range of programmability offered by a TCU allows the modern automatic transmission to be used with appropriate transmission characteristics for each application. On some applications, the TCU and the ECU are combined into a single unit as a powertrain control module (PCM).  Input parameters  The typical modern TCU uses signals from engine sensors, automatic transmission sensors and from other electronic controllers to determine when and how to shift.Functions of automatic transmission More modern designs share inputs or obtain information from an input to the ECU, whereas older designs often have their own dedicated inputs and sensors on the engine components. Modern TCUs are so complex in their design and make calculations based on so many parameters that there are an indefinite amount of possible shift behaviours  Vehicle speed sensor (VSS)  This sensor sends a varying frequency signal to the TCU to determine the current speed of the vehicle. The TCU uses this information to determine when a gear change should take place based in the various operating parameters. The TCU also uses a ratio between the TSS and WSS which is used to determine when to change gears. If either the TSS or WSS fails or malfunctions/becomes faulty, the ratio will be wrong which in return can cause problems like false speedometer readings and transmission slipping. To test these parts, check the resistance to make sure it's within manufacturer specs.  Wheel speed sensor (WSS)  Modern automatic transmissions also have a wheel speed sensor input to determine the true speed of the vehicle to determine whether the vehicle is going downhill or uphill and also adapt gear changes according to road speeds, and also whether to decouple the torque converter at a standstill to improve fuel consumption and reduce load on running gear.  Throttle position sensor (TPS)  The TPS sensor along with the vehicle speed sensor are the two main inputs for most TCUs. Older transmissions use this to determine engine load, with the introduction of drive-by-wire technology, this is often a shared input between the ECU and TCU. The input is used to determine the optimum time and characteristics for a gear change according to load on the engine. The rate of change is used to determine whether a downshift is appropriate for overtaking, for example, the value of the TPS is also continually monitored during the journey and shift programmes are changed accordingly (economy, sport mode, etc.). The TCU can also reference this information with the vehicle speed sensor to determine vehicle acceleration and compare this with a nominal value; if the actual value is much higher or lower (such as driving uphill or towing a trailer) the transmission will change its gearshift patterns to suit the situation.  Turbine speed sensor (TSS)  Known as an input speed sensor (ISS). This sensor sends a varying frequency signal to the TCU to determine the current rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter. The TCU uses the input shaft speed to determine slippage across the torque converter and potentially to determine the rate of slippage across the bands and clutches. This information is vital to regulate the application of the torque converter lock-up clutch smoothly and effectively.  Transmission fluid Temperature sensor (TFT)  This may also be known as Transmission Oil Temperature. This sensor determines the fluid temperature inside the transmission. This is often used for diagnostic purposes to check ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) at the correct temperature. The main use of this has been as a failsafe feature to downshift the transmission if the ATF becomes extremely hot. On more modern transmissions this input allows the TCU to modify the line pressure and solenoid pressures according to the changing viscosity of the fluid based on temperature in order to improve shift comfort, and also to determine regulation of the torque converter lock-up clutch.  Kick down switch  One of the most common inputs into a TCU is the kick down switch which is used to determine if the accelerator pedal has been depressed past full throttle.Kick down switch Traditionally this was required on older transmissions with a simple logic in order to ensure maximum acceleration. When activated the transmission downshifts into the lowest permissible gear based on current road speed to use the full power reserves of the engine. This is still present in most transmissions though is no longer necessary to use in most circumstances because the TCU uses the throttle position sensor, the rate of change, and driver characteristics to determine whether a downshift may be necessary, thus eliminating the traditional need for this switch.  Brake light switch  This input is used to determine whether to activate the shift lock solenoid to prevent the driver selecting a driving range with no foot on the brake. In more modern TCUs this input is also used to determine whether to downshift the transmission to increase engine braking effect if the transmission detects that the vehicle is going downhill.  Traction Control System (TCS)  Many TCUs now have an input from the vehicle's traction control system. If the TCS detects unfavourable road conditions, a signal is sent to the TCU. The TCU can modify shift programmes by upshifting early, eliminating the torque converter lock-up clutch application, and also eliminating the first gear totally and pulling off in 2nd.http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/auto/systems/transmission_control.html  Switches  These simple on/off electric switches detect the presence or absence of fluid pressure in a particular hydraulic line. They are used for diagnostic purposes and in some cases for controlling the application or release of hydraulic control elements.  Cruise control module  If the vehicle is fitted with cruise control the TCU may also have a connection to cruise control system. This can modify shift behaviour to take into account the throttle is not being operated by the driver to eliminate unexpected gearchanges when the cruise control is engaged. This is also used to inform the cruise control system about the position of the selector lever so that the cruise control can be deactivated if the lever is shifted out of a driving range.  Inputs from other controllers  A wide variety of information is delivered to the TCU via Controller Area Network communications or similar protocols (such as Chrysler's CCD bus, an early EIA-485-based vehicle local area network). In older vehicle designs, as well as in aftermarket TCUs sold into the racing and hobbyist markets, the TCU receives only the signals needed to control the transmission (engine speed, vehicle speed, throttle position or manifold vacuum, shift lever position).  Output parameters  The typical modern TCU sends out signals to shift solenoids, pressure control solenoids, torque converter lockup solenoids and to other electronic controllers.  Shift lock  Many automatic transmissions lock the selector lever via a shiftlock solenoid to stop a driving range being selected if the brake pedal is not depressed. http://www.autoshop101.com/forms/h18.pdf  Shift solenoids  Modern electronic automatic transmissions have electrical solenoids which are activated to change gears. Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) use the solenoids to modify the shift points in an existing valve body, while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its follow-ons) use the solenoids to control the clutches indirectly, by way of a greatly simplified valve body.  Pressure control solenoids  Modern electronic automatic transmissions are still fundamentally hydraulic. This requires precise pressure control. Older automatic transmission designs only use a single line pressure control solenoid which modifies pressure across the entire transmission. Newer automatic transmission designs often use many pressure control solenoids, and sometimes allow the shift solenoids themselves to provide precise pressure control during shifts by ramping the solenoid on and off. The shift pressure affects the shift quality (too high a pressure will result in rough shifting; too low a pressure will cause the clutches to overheat) and shift speed. :)  Torque converter clutch solenoid (TCC)  Most electronic automatic transmissions utilize a TCC solenoid to regulate the torque converter electronically. Once fully locked, the torque converter no longer applies torque multiplication and will spin at the same speed as the engine. This provides a major increase in fuel economy. Modern designs provide partial lockup in lower gears to improve fuel economy further, but this can increase wear on the clutch components.  Output to ECU  Many TCUs provide an output to the ECU to retard the ignition timing, or reduce the fuel quantity, for a few milliseconds to reduce load on the transmission during heavy throttle. This allows automatic transmissions to shift smoothly even on engines with large amounts of torque which would otherwise result in a harder shift and possible damage to the gearbox.  Outputs to other controllers  The TCU provides information about the health of the transmission, such as clutch wear indicators and shift pressures, and can raise trouble codes and set the malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster if a serious problem is found. An output to the cruise control module is also often present to deactivate the cruise control if a neutral gear is selected, just like on a manual transmission.

History  Ryderwood was established as a logging camp by Long-Bell Lumber Company in 1923. Simultaneously, the town of Longview, WA was created to mill and ship the lumber coming out of Ryderwood. Ryderwood was named for W. F. (“Uncle Bill”) Ryder, logging operations manager for Long-Bell, who came to the northwest to locate a timber source. The town was envisioned as being a different sort of town. It was envisioned as being a permanent center rather than a temporary logging camp and contained a school, a church, and a theater. Billed as a place for families to live rather than bachelor workers, Ryderwood was considered a \\"modern logging town,\\" as an article from \\"The Log of Long- Bell\\" proclaimed. By 1953, due to advances in timber harvesting technology, the old growth was gone and Long-Bell chose to sell the town. It was purchased by Senior Estates, Inc. for $96,000 with the goal of creating a retirement community for pensioners. As of 2019, Ryderwood remains a retirement community managed by the Ryderwood Improvement and Service Association, a non-profit 501(c)4 organization staffed by resident volunteers.

Ultra Panavision 70 was similar to Super Panavision 70, though Ultra Panavision lenses were anamorphic, which allowed for a significantly wider aspect ratio. However, Ultra Panavision 70 was extremely rare and has only been used on a handful of films since its inception. History During the late 1950s, the Hollywood filmmaking community decided that changing from filming in the commonly accepted 35 mm format to 65 mm film would provide viewing audiences with an enhanced visual experience, compared to an anamorphic widescreen image. To this end, cameras began to be designed to handle 65 mm film stock. The first camera system to be released using this format was Todd-AO, in 1955. The second was MGM Camera 65, a system designed by Panavision, which was introduced in 1956. In 1959, Panavision introduced Super Panavision 70 to compete with these two systems. Unlike its counterpart Ultra Panavision 70, which used anamorphic lenses, Super Panavision used spherical lenses to create a final aspect ratio of 2.20:1. Some of the films made in Super Panavision 70 were presented in 70 mm Cinerama in select theaters. Special optics were used to project the 70 mm prints onto a deeply curved screen to mimic the effect of the original three-strip Cinerama process. The terms \\"Super Panavision 70\\", \\"Panavision 70\\" and \\"Super Panavision\\" were interchangeable, whereas the term \\"70mm Panavision\\" referred to films shot in 35mm anamorphic Panavision and blown up to 70mm for release. Movies using Super Panavision 70 * The Big Fisherman (1959) * Exodus (1960) * West Side Story (1961) * Lawrence of Arabia (1962) * My Fair Lady (1964) * Cheyenne Autumn (1964) * Lord Jim (1965) * Grand Prix (1966) – presented in 70 mm Cinerama * 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) – presented in 70 mm Cinerama * Ice Station Zebra (1968) – presented in 70 mm Cinerama * Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) * Mackenna's Gold (1969) * Krakatoa, East of Java (1969) – selected scenes in Todd-AO – presented in 70 mm Cinerama * Song of Norway (1970) – advertised as \\"on the Cinerama screen\\" in some countries * Ryan's Daughter (1970) * Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) – special effects shots only; early promotional material erroneously suggested that the entire film was produced in Super Panavision 70 * Tron (1982) – 'Real world' live-action filmed in color 65 mm; Computer world live action filmed in 65 mm B&W;, composited to a VistaVision intermediate, and optically printed back to 70 mm IP.

The system was designed to compete with the parallel development of the Arriflex 765 camera. The new System 65 camera was self-blimped, with reflex viewing designed as the 65 mm cousin to the 35 mm Panaflex camera (and used many of the same accessories). Only two System 65 cameras were ever built, and the small fleet of old 65 mm handheld reflex cameras had their lens mounts modified to accept the System 65 lenses. The System 65 lenses were all a medium-format variant of lens designs from the (then) current line of Panavision Primos.

Wrestling career Gutteridge was born in Islington and had been a sports teacher. He became a wrestler and was billed from Highbury, North London and was regarded as one of the first stars of British professional wrestling. During his career, his most famous rivalry was an 11-year-long battle with perhaps the greatest villain in British wrestling history, Mick McManus. In 1973, Pallo made two unsuccessful attempts to beat McManus for the European Middleweight Championship. Pallo was a risk-taking athlete on the one hand but pushed credibility to the limits at other times owing to his over-the-top cockiness. Fans rejoiced in his sit-on back breaker and arm lever, his aeroplane spin, and his cross-shoulder backbreaker. Pallo's star was further affirmed when a 1964 date in Bishop's Stortford sold out in only 3 hours. His sole major accolade during his career was a short 1969 run as the British Heavy Middleweight Champion, having defeated Bert Royal on 21 April before dropping the title back to Royal the following month. His feud with McManus was featured in the 2012 BBC documentary When Wrestling Was Golden: Grapples, Grunts and Grannies.Garfield Simon.

Early years  Geshe Wangyal was the youngest of four children and had chosen at age six to enter the monastery as a novice monk. After the Russian Civil War, Geshe Wangyal went to Lhasa, Tibet, where he studied at the Gomang College of Drepung Monastic University in Lhasa until 1935 when he decided to return to his homeland to obtain financial support to complete his studies. Due to Communist persecution of religious clergy, Geshe Wangyal decided to end his return trip home. Instead, he found a job in Peking, China, comparing different editions of the Tibetan collections of Buddha's word (Kanjur) and of the treatises of Indian commentators (Tanjur). In 1937, Geshe Wangyal left Peking to return to Tibet via India after earning enough money to support himself until he received his geshe degree from Drepung. While in Calcutta, Geshe Wangyal was hired as a translator to Sir Charles Bell, a well-known British statesman, scholar and explorer, and accompanied him on a trip through China and Manchuria before returning to Tibet. Afterwards, he received his geshe degree in Lhasa and used his remaining earnings and many newly established contacts to raise funds for the purpose of assisting poor scholars to obtain their geshe degree, especially Mongolians in India, who, like him, were cut off from support from a Communist home country. When the Communist Chinese invaded Tibet in the early 1950s, Geshe Wangyal escaped to India. Then in 1955, he went to the United States to work as a priest among the Kalmyk Americans who were newly resettled in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as refugees from Central Europe.  Buddhist monastery's teacher  In 1958, Geshe Wangyal established and built a Buddhist monastery in Washington, New Jersey called Labsum Shedrub Ling.Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center in New Jersey He served as the monastery's head teacher until his death in January, 1983. He taught many students of Western background and contributed greatly to the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. Geshe Wangyal later taught at Columbia University and during the 1960s and 1970s, he sponsored visits by several monks and lamas from the Tibetan emigre settlement in India and instructed them in English so they could serve the Buddhist community in the United States. In 1972, the American Institute of Buddhist Studies was founded as suggested by the Dalai Lama and Geshe Ngawang Wangyal.History Dr. Wangyal translated two volumes of popular Tibetan and Sanskrit stories illustrative of Buddhist teachings, The Door of Liberation and The Prince Who Became a Cuckoo. With Brian Cutillo, he also translated the \\"Illuminations of Sakya-Pandita\\" published by (LOTSAWA 1988). The book is now out-of-print.

It reads: On 23 June 1938 the National Socialists stormed the apartment of Dr. Joannes Baptista Sproll, 1870-1949, the seventh Bishop of Rottenburg. In the same year, the government forced the bishop into exile; he could not return to his diocese from Krumbad until after the war. Joannes Baptista Sproll (2 October 1870 - 4 March 1949) was a German bishop and prominent opponent of the Nazi regime. Sproll was born in Schweinhausen, near Biberach, the son of a street mender, Josef Sproll, and his wife, Anna Maria née Freuer. He attended the Latin school in Biberach and the Gymnasium Ehingen. He studied Catholic theology at the University of Tübingen from 1890 to 1894. In 1898, he received his Ph.D. for his work on the history of the law and constitution of the Tübingen monastery of St. George. On 14 June 1927 he became the Bishop of Rottenburg. During the Nazi era, Sproll often spoke out against the regime, and his abstention from the plebiscite over the Anschluss led to preliminary proceedings and staged demonstrations against him. At the end of August 1938, Sproll was expelled from his diocese and could not return again until 1945. On 1 August 1940 Conrad Gröber, Archbishop of Freiburg, and the Vicar General of the Diocese of Rottenburg (acting for Sproll) protested against the euthanasia programmes in Grafeneck; this was also the year of the protest of the Bishop of Münster, Clemens August Graf von Galen.

He was Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, Attorney General of Illinois, an Associate Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, Chargé d'Affaires to New Granada, and United States Senator from Illinois. Semple was born in Green County, Kentucky and was raised and educated in Clinton County. He served in the Kentucky Militia during the War of 1812 and then moved to Missouri, where he was active in the militia and owned and operated several businesses. He later studied law in Missouri and Kentucky, attained admission to the bar, and moved to Edwardsville, Illinois to start a practice. He became active in politics as a Democrat, but was opposed to slavery, and he served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1828 to 1832. He continued his militia service after moving to Illinois, and took part in the Black Hawk War. After service as Illinois Attorney General from 1832 to 1834, Semple returned to the Illinois House, where he served as Speaker from 1834 to 1837. From 1838 to 1842, Semple served as US Chargé d'Affaires in New Granada. Upon returning to Illinois, he was appointed an Associate Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, but he served only a few months because later that year he was selected to fill a vacancy in the US Senate, where he served from 1843 to 1847. After leaving politics, Semple practiced law, was active in several business ventures, and attempted to market an invention called the prairie car, a forerunner of the modern automobile. He died in Elsah, Illinois, a town he founded, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Early life James Semple was born in Green County, Kentucky on January 5, 1798, the son of John Walker Semple and Lucy (Robertson) Semple. Semple's grandfather Robert Semple served in the Virginia legislature, and his father served in the legislature of Kentucky. James Semple was raised on his father's Clinton County homestead, which John Sample named \\"76\\". He received his early education from his mother, a talented woman educated enough to argue cases in court when no lawyers were available, and was tutored by his uncle Isaac Robertson, who was a graduate of Princeton College. Start of career In 1814, the sixteen-year-old Semple volunteered for the Kentucky Militia during the War of 1812. He served until the end war, and in 1817 received a commission as an ensign in Kentucky's 81st Militia Regiment. In 1818, Semple moved to Edwardsville, Illinois, but he remained for only nine months before returning to Kentucky. In 1819, he moved to Chariton, Missouri, where he operated a tannery and became active in other business ventures. In addition, he joined the Missouri Militia's 21st Infantry Regiment, which he later commanded with the rank of colonel. Soon after arriving in Chariton, Semple was elected a state Loan Commissioner. In response to the Panic of 1819, Missouri's government authorized the issuing of paper money that could be loaned to farmers so that they wouldn't lose their land during the economic downturn. Loan Office Banks throughout the state were supervised by commissioners who loaned the money, ensured it was repaid, and instituted foreclosure proceedings and auctions for farmers who defaulted on their loans. After the sudden death of his first wife in 1821, Semple decided on a career as an attorney and began to study law. He moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1824 to continue his studies, and after three years of learning he was admitted to the bar and returned to Edwardsville in 1827 to start a law practice. Continued career Semple practiced law in Edwardsville and became active in politics. Though he opposed slavery, he became a Democrat, and advocated abolition in opposition to most members of his party, who either supported slavery or accepted that it could continue where it already existed. During the Black Hawk War of 1832, Semple was appointed adjutant of the Illinois Militia's 8th Infantry Regiment, then adjutant of a newly-organized mounted regiment, and then aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Samuel Whiteside and judge advocate of Whiteside's brigade. Semple later commanded the 8th Regiment as a colonel, and subsequently attained the rank of brigadier general. In 1828, Semple was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, and he served until 1832. He served as Illinois Attorney General from 1832 to 1834, and did not run for reelection, preferring instead to become a candidate for the Illinois House. He won a House seat and was chosen to serve as Speaker of the House, a post he held until 1837. In 1836, Semple was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate. In addition to practicing law, he became involved in business ventures including real estate speculation, and was one of the founders of the town of Highland and the village of Tamaroa. In 1837, he moved to Alton, where he continued to practice law. Diplomat In 1837, President Martin Van Buren appointed Semple as Chargé d'Affaires in New Granada. Semple had not sought the appointment, but decided to accept. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and served from October 14, 1837 until resigning on March 4, 1842. As Chargé, Semple was empowered to act as a minister, and was commended by New Granada's government and members of the various groups opposed to it for the tact and fairness with which he advocated for U.S. interests without showing favoritism. U.S. Senator On January 6, 1843, Semple was appointed an Associate Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, filling the vacancy left when Sidney Breese resigned to accept election to the U.S. Senate. He served until August 16, 1843, and was succeeded by James Shields. Semple left the court to accept election to the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Samuel McRoberts. He served the remainder of the term to which Roberts had been elected, August 16, 1843 to March 3, 1847, and was not a candidate for reelection in 1846. In the Senate, Semple was concerned primarily with resolving the Oregon boundary dispute, which was ended by passage of the Oregon Treaty in 1846. Semple also proposed reform of the U.S. consular system. Consular appointments were patronage positions, and most incumbents received no salary, but were compensated by the fees they were allowed to charge for notarizing travel documents, verifying the passenger manifests of arriving U.S. ships, and verifying the contents of arriving U.S. cargo ships. Semple introduced a bill that would have professionalized the consular corps and provided for the payment of salaries in lieu of fees, but it was not adopted during his time in the Senate. At the outbreak of the Mexican–American War, Semple sought an Army commission as commander of a regiment or brigade, but was refused by President James K. Polk, who was unhappy that Semple disagreed with the results of the Polk administration's negotiations over Oregon. Later life In 1845, Semple began work on a vehicle he called a prairie car, a forerunner of the automobile. Semple's prairie car was a wagon fitted with a steam engine and wide tires that enabled it to run on roads or rough terrain. He attracted investors in the project, formed a corporation and issued stock, but abandoned the effort when manufacturers proved unable to provide the needed parts, and mechanics proved unable to purchase or make the tools necessary to effect repairs on his prototype. Semple left his prototype in a field outside Springfield, where for many years it was pointed out to newcomers to town as \\"Semple's Folly\\". After leaving the Senate in 1847, Semple resumed practicing law in Alton. He was also a participant in several businesses, including investing in land north of Alton where he laid out a community known as Sempletown. This enterprise did not succeed, and Semple decided to leave Alton. He purchased an estate in Jersey County, where in 1853 he founded the town of Elsah, Illinois and owned businesses including a mill and a distillery. In retirement, he served as Elsah's postmaster and worked on a history of Mexico, Central America and South America, but his manuscript was never published. During the American Civil War, Semple was sympathetic to the states' rights arguments of the Confederacy, but remained loyal to the Union and supported measures including loyalty oaths. Death and burial James Semple died in Elsah on December 20, 1866 and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Family In 1819, Semple married Ellen Duff Green, a niece of Duff Green. She died in 1821, and in 1833 Semple married Mary Stevenson Mizner, a daughter of Dr. Caldwell Cairns and Mary (Stevenson) Cairns, and the widow of Henry Mizner. Semple's stepson, Lansing B. Mizner was an American politician and diplomat who served as U.S. Minister to several Central American countries. His step- grandson Addison Mizner was a well-known architect, and step-grandson Wilson Mizner was a famous playwright. Eugene Semple, the son of James and Mary Semple, served as Governor of Washington Territory from 1887 to 1889. His daughter Lucy Virginia became the wife of wealthy St. Louis businessman Edgar Ames. After his death, Lucy Ames expanded her husband's business holdings and added to his fortune, and became prominent as an advocate for political causes including women's suffrage and higher education for women. His daughter Julia was the wife of Ashley D. Scott, who operated a successful grocery wholesale business in St. Louis and a founder of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm and organizer of the Veiled Prophet Ball. Dr. Robert Semple, a brother of James Semple, was a founder of Benicia, California, and president of California's 1849 constitutional convention.

Stern joined the Seattle Weatherman collective, where her extensive use of drugs, provocative style of dress and habit of supporting the collective by topless dancing earned her enemies among the group's more solemn female leadership.

The 1996 edition includes some additional essays published between 1973 and 1980, particularly on fuzzy logic.) uses the term \\"deviant logic\\" to describe certain non-classical systems of logic. In these logics, * the set of well-formed formulas generated equals the set of well- formed formulas generated by classical logic. * the set of theorems generated is different from the set of theorems generated by classical logic. The set of theorems of a deviant logic can differ in any possible way from classical logic's set of theorems: as a proper subset, superset, or fully exclusive set. A notable example of this is the trivalent logic developed by Polish logician and mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz. Under this system, any theorem necessarily dependent on classical logic's principle of bivalence would fail to be valid. The term first appears in Chapter 6 of Willard Van Orman Quine's Philosophy of Logic, New Jersey: Prentice Hall (1970), which is cited by Haack on p. 15 of her book. Quasi-deviant and extended logics Haack also described what she calls a quasi-deviant logic. These logics are different from pure deviant logics in that: * the set of well-formed formulas generated is a proper superset of the set of well-formed formulas generated by classical logic. * the set of theorems generated is a proper superset of the set of theorems generated by classical logic, both in that the quasi-deviant logic generates novel theorems using well-formed formulas held in common with classical logic, as well as novel theorems using novel well-formed formulas. Finally, Haack defined a class of merely extended logics. In these, * the set of well-formed formulas generated is a proper superset of the set of well-formed formulas generated by classical logic. * the set of theorems generated is a proper superset of the set of theorems generated by classical logic, but only in that the novel theorems generated by the extended logic are only a result of novel well-formed formulas. Some systems of modal logic meet this definition. In such systems, any novel theorem would not parse in classical logic due to modal operators. While deviant and quasi-deviant logics are typically proposed as rivals to classical logic, the impetus behind extended logics is normally only to provide a supplement to it.  Two decades later  Achille Varzi in his review of the 1996 edition of Haack's book writes that the survey did not stand well the test of time, particularly with the \\"extraordinary proliferation of nonclassical logics in the past two decades—paraconsistent logics, linear logics, substructural logics, nonmonotonic logics, innumerable other logics for AI and computer science.\\" He also finds that Haack's account of vagueness \\"is now seriously defective.\\" He concedes however that \\"as a defense of a philosophical position, Deviant Logic retains its significance.\\" References Category:Non-classical logic ","title":"Deviant logic"},{"id":"4135785","text":"Daisy Zamora (born 20 June 1950 in Managua, Nicaragua) is a contemporary Latin American poet.

In humans, it can be more accurately said to lie in a region around the intersection of the middle frontal gyrus with the precentral gyrus, consisting of a frontal and parietal portion. The FEF is responsible for saccadic eye movements for the purpose of visual field perception and awareness, as well as for voluntary eye movement. The FEF communicates with extraocular muscles indirectly via the paramedian pontine reticular formation. Destruction of the FEF causes deviation of the eyes to the ipsilateral side. Function The cortical area called frontal eye field (FEF) plays an important role in the control of visual attention and eye movements. Electrical stimulation in the FEF elicits saccadic eye movements. The FEF have a topographic structure and represents saccade targets in retinotopic coordinates. The frontal eye field is reported to be activated during the initiation of eye movements, such as voluntary saccades and pursuit eye movements. There is also evidence that it plays a role in purely sensory processing and that it belongs to a “fast brain” system through a superior colliculus – medial dorsal nucleus – FEF ascending pathway. In humans, its earliest activations in regard to visual stimuli occur at 45 ms with activations related to changes in visual stimuli within 45–60 ms (these are comparable with response times in the primary visual cortex). This fast brain pathway also provides auditory input at even shorter times starting at 24 ms and being affected by auditory characteristics at 30–60 ms. The FEF constitutes together with the supplementary eye fields (SEF), the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the superior colliculus (SC) one of the most important brain areas involved in the generation and control of eye movements, particularly in the direction contralateral to the frontal eye fields' location.

Population: ; 36,000 (1970). History The village of Sokolovo () existed on this location since at least 1615. Since 1796, the village was part of Kadnikovsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. In 1897, a paper mill was built near the village and Sokolovo became the primary place of residence of the employees of the mill. In November 1923, the Vologda Executive Committee decreed to create Sverdlovsko-Sukhonsky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Sokol; however, the decision was not approved by the central authorities, and the district was never created. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Sverdlovsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Sokol was established among others. It became a part of Vologda Okrug of Northern Krai. In 1932, Sokol was granted town status, and the district was renamed Sokolsky.

Opening allows increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membranes to molecules of less than 1500 Daltons in molecular weight. Induction of the permeability transition pore, mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (mPT or MPT), can lead to mitochondrial swelling and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis depending on the particular biological setting. Roles in pathology The MPTP was originally discovered by Haworth and Hunter in 1979 and has been found to be involved in neurodegeneration, hepatotoxicity from Reye-related agents, cardiac necrosis and nervous and muscular dystrophies among other deleterious events inducing cell damage and death. MPT is one of the major causes of cell death in a variety of conditions. For example, it is key in neuronal cell death in excitotoxicity, in which overactivation of glutamate receptors causes excessive calcium entry into the cell. MPT also appears to play a key role in damage caused by ischemia, as occurs in a heart attack and stroke. However, research has shown that the MPT pore remains closed during ischemia, but opens once the tissues are reperfused with blood after the ischemic period, playing a role in reperfusion injury. MPT is also thought to underlie the cell death induced by Reye's syndrome, since chemicals that can cause the syndrome, like salicylate and valproate, cause MPT. MPT may also play a role in mitochondrial autophagy. Cells exposed to toxic amounts of Ca2+ ionophores also undergo MPT and death by necrosis. Structure While the MPT modulation has been widely studied, little is known about its structure . Initial experiments by Szabó and Zoratti proposed the MPT may comprise Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) molecules. Nevertheless, this hypothesis was shown to be incorrect as VDAC−/− mitochondria were still capable to undergo MPT. Further hypothesis by Halestrap's group convincingly suggested the MPT was formed by the inner membrane Adenine Nucleotide Translocase (ANT), but genetic ablation of such protein still led to MPT onset. Thus, the only MPTP components identified so far are the TSPO (previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and cyclophilin-D in the mitochondrial matrix. Mice lacking the gene for cyclophilin-D develop normally, but their cells do not undergo Cyclosporin A-sensitive MPT, and they are resistant to necrotic death from ischemia or overload of Ca2+ or free radicals. However, these cells do die in response to stimuli that kill cells through apoptosis, suggesting that MPT does not control cell death by apoptosis. MPTP blockers Agents that transiently block MPT include the immune suppressant cyclosporin A (CsA); N-methyl-Val-4-cyclosporin A (MeValCsA), a non-immunosuppressant derivative of CsA; another non- immunosuppressive agent, NIM811, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), bongkrekic acid and alisporivir (also known as Debio-025). TRO40303 is a newly synthetitised MPT blocker developed by Trophos company and currently is in Phase I clinical trial. Factors in MPT induction Various factors enhance the likelihood of MPTP opening. In some mitochondria, such as those in the central nervous system, high levels of Ca2+ within mitochondria can cause the MPT pore to open. This is possibly because Ca2+ binds to and activates Ca2+ binding sites on the matrix side of the MPTP. MPT induction is also due to the dissipation of the difference in voltage across the inner mitochondrial membrane (known as transmembrane potential, or Δψ). In neurons and astrocytes, the contribution of membrane potential to MPT induction is complex, see. The presence of free radicals, another result of excessive intracellular calcium concentrations, can also cause the MPT pore to open. Other factors that increase the likelihood that the MPTP will be induced include the presence of certain fatty acids, and inorganic phosphate. However, these factors cannot open the pore without Ca2+, though at high enough concentrations, Ca2+ alone can induce MPT. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum can be a factor in triggering MPT. Conditions that cause the pore to close or remain closed include acidic conditions, high concentrations of ADP, high concentrations of ATP, and high concentrations of NADH. Divalent cations like Mg2+ also inhibit MPT, because they can compete with Ca2+ for the Ca2+ binding sites on the matrix and/or cytoplasmic side of the MPTP. Effects Multiple studies have found the MPT to be a key factor in the damage to neurons caused by excitotoxicity. The induction of MPT, which increases mitochondrial membrane permeability, causes mitochondria to become further depolarized, meaning that Δψ is abolished. When Δψ is lost, protons and some molecules are able to flow across the outer mitochondrial membrane uninhibited. Loss of Δψ interferes with the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main source of energy, because mitochondria must have an electrochemical gradient to provide the driving force for ATP production. In cell damage resulting from conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and head injury, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore can greatly reduce ATP production, and can cause ATP synthase to begin hydrolysing, rather than producing, ATP. This produces an energy deficit in the cell, just when it most needs ATP to fuel activity of ion pumps such as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which must be activated more than under normal conditions in order to rid the cell of excess calcium. MPT also allows Ca2+ to leave the mitochondrion, which can place further stress on nearby mitochondria, and which can activate harmful calcium- dependent proteases such as calpain. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also produced as a result of opening the MPT pore. MPT can allow antioxidant molecules such as glutathione to exit mitochondria, reducing the organelles' ability to neutralize ROS. In addition, the electron transport chain (ETC) may produce more free radicals due to loss of components of the ETC, such as cytochrome c, through the MPTP. Loss of ETC components can lead to escape of electrons from the chain, which can then reduce molecules and form free radicals. MPT causes mitochondria to become permeable to molecules smaller than 1.5 kDa, which, once inside, draw water in by increasing the organelle's osmolar load. This event may lead mitochondria to swell and may cause the outer membrane to rupture, releasing cytochrome c. Cytochrome c can in turn cause the cell to go through apoptosis (\\"commit suicide\\") by activating pro- apoptotic factors. Other researchers contend that it is not mitochondrial membrane rupture that leads to cytochrome c release, but rather another mechanism, such as translocation of the molecule through channels in the outer membrane, which does not involve the MPTP. Much research has found that the fate of the cell after an insult depends on the extent of MPT. If MPT occurs to only a slight extent, the cell may recover, whereas if it occurs more it may undergo apoptosis. If it occurs to an even larger degree the cell is likely to undergo necrotic cell death. Possible evolutionary purpose Although the MPTP has been studied mainly in mitochondria from mammalian sources, mitochondria from diverse species also undergo a similar transition. While its occurrence can be easily detected, its purpose still remains elusive. Some have speculated that the regulated opening of the MPT pore may minimize cell injury by causing ROS-producing mitochondria to undergo selective lysosome-dependent mitophagy during nutrient starvation conditions. Under severe stress/pathologic conditions, MPTP opening would trigger injured cell death mainly through necrosis.Haworth RA and Hunter DR. 2001. Ca2+-induced transition in mitochondria: A cellular catastrophe? Chapter 6 In Mitochondria in pathogenesis. Lemasters JJ and Nieminen AL, eds. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers. New York. Pages 115 - 124. There is controversy about the question of whether the MPTP is able to exist in a harmless, \\"low- conductance\\" state. This low-conductance state would not induce MPT and would allow certain molecules and ions to cross the mitochondrial membranes. The low-conductance state may allow small ions like Ca2+ to leave mitochondria quickly, in order to aid in the cycling of Ca2+ in healthy cells. If this is the case, MPT may be a harmful side effect of abnormal activity of a usually beneficial MPTP. MPTP has been detected in mitochondria from plants, yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, birds, such as guinea fowl and primitive vertebrates such as the Baltic lamprey. While the permeability transition is evident in mitochondria from these sources, its sensitivity to its classic modulators may differ when compared with mammalian mitochondria. Nevertheless, CsA-insensitive MPTP can be triggered in mammalian mitochondria given appropriate experimental conditions strongly suggesting this event may be a conserved characteristic throughout the eukaryotic domain.

Although it is subject to debate as to whether this was intended to be circulating coinage or instead an experimental issue, President George Washington referred to it as \\"a small beginning\\" and many of the coins eventually were released into circulation. It is widely (although not universally) considered the first United States coinage struck under authority of the Coinage Act of 1792. Origins When speaking to the House of Representatives in November 1792, President Washington mentioned the \\"want of small coins in circulation\\" and stated that he had begun work on establishing a U.S. Mint and that some half dismes had been produced already. At this point, most of the personnel had been hired, but the Mint's buildings and machinery were not yet ready. As a result, the half dismes, which had been struck in or around July 1792, were produced using the private facilities of local craftsman John Harper, although under the auspices of official Mint personnel. In his personal log book, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson recorded the receipt of 1,500 specimens on July 13. Because of President Washington's connection with these early coins, numismatic folklore holds that the portrait on the obverse is that of First Lady Martha Washington and that some of the coins were struck using melted-down silverware from the Washington household. However, there is no solid evidence for either of these assertions. Production, rarity, and value Although the exact number is not known, it is believed that between 2,000 and 3,500 specimens were produced. Approximately 10% of these survive today; one expert estimated between 250 and 400 half dismes exist, and most appear to have been used in circulation for some time. An about uncirculated (AU55 on the Sheldon coin grading scale) 1792 half disme was auctioned for $138,000 on July 24, 2004. A specimen strike from the Starr collection, graded MS67 by PCGS, sold for $1,322,500 on April 26, 2006. The highest numerically graded piece, an NGC MS68, sold for $1,500,000 by private treaty transaction in 2007.

ADF/cofilin is a family of actin-binding proteins associated with the rapid depolymerization of actin microfilaments that give actin its characteristic dynamic instability. This dynamic instability is central to actin's role in muscle contraction, cell motility and transcription regulation. Three highly conserved and highly (70%-82%) identical genes belonging to this family have been described in humans and mice: * CFL1, coding for cofilin 1 (non-muscle, or n-cofilin) * CFL2, coding for cofilin 2 (found in muscle: m-cofilin) * DSTN, coding for destrin, also known as ADF or actin depolymerizing factor Actin-binding proteins regulate assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cooper, G. M. and R. E. Hausman. The Cell: A Molecular Approach, 3rd ed. Washington DC: ASM Press 2004 pp.436-440. Cofilin, a member of the ADF/cofilin family is actually a protein with 70% sequence identity to destrin, making it part of the ADF/cofilin family of small ADP-binding proteins. The protein binds to actin monomers and filaments, G actin and F actin, respectively. Cofilin causes depolymerization at the minus end of filaments, thereby preventing their reassembly. The protein is known to sever actin filaments by creating more positive ends on filament fragments. Cofilin/ADF (destrin) is likely to sever F-actin without capping and prefers ADP-actin. These monomers can be recycled by profilin, activating monomers to go back into filament form again by an ADP-to-ATP exchange. ATP-actin is then available for assembly.  Structure  Cofilin-1 protein, a member of the actin depolymerizing factor protein family, isolated in yeast. The structure of actin depolymerizing factors is highly conserved across many organism due to actin's importance in many cellular processes. Proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor family characteristically consist of five beta sheets, four antiparallel and one parallel, and four alpha helices with a central alpha helix providing the structure and stability of the proteins. The actin depolymerizing factor homology domain (ADF-H domain) allows for binding to actin subunits and includes the central alpha helix, the N terminus extension, and the C terminus helix. * The N-terminus extension consists of a tilted loop that facilitates binding to G-actin but not F-actin due to steric hindrance present in F-actin. * The C-terminus can form hydrogen bonds to F actin through its amide backbone and a serine at position S274. This serine is especially highly evolutionarily conserved due to its importance in actin binding. * The central alpha helix is inserted into the hydrophobic cleft in between the first and third subunits of actin during actin binding. Cofilin binds monomeric (G-actin) and filamentous actin (F-actin). Its binding affinities are higher for ADP-actin over ADP-Pi and ATP-actin. Its binding changes the twist of F-actin. The structure of ADF was first characterized in 1980 by James Bamburg. Four actin histidines near the cofilin binding site may be needed for cofilin/actin interaction, but pH sensitivity alone may not be enough of an explanation for the levels of interaction encountered. Cofilin is accommodated in ADP-F actin because of increased flexibility in this form of actin. Binding by both cofilin and ADF (destrin) causes the crossover length of the filament to be reduced. Therefore, strains increase filament dynamics and the level of filament fragmentation observed. Function Cofilin is a ubiquitous actin-binding factor required for the reorganization of actin filaments. ADF/Cofilin family members bind G-actin monomers and depolymerize actin filaments through two mechanisms: severing and increasing the off-rate for actin monomers from the pointed end. \\"Older\\" ADP/ADP-Pi actin filaments free of tropomyosin and proper pH are required for cofilin to function effectively. In the presence of readily available ATP-G-actin cofilin speeds up actin polymerization via its actin-severing activity (providing free barbed ends for further polymerization and nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex). As a long-lasting in vivo effect, cofilin recycles older ADP-F-actin, helping cell to maintain ATP-G-actin pool for sustained motility. pH, phosphorylation and phosphoinositides regulate cofilin's binding and associating activity with actin The Arp2/3 complex and cofilin work together to reorganize the actin filaments in the cytoskeleton. Arp 2/3, an actin binding proteins complex, binds to the side of ATP-F-actin near the growing barbed end of the filament, causing nucleation of a new F-actin branch, while cofilin-driven depolymerization takes place after dissociating from the Arp2/3 complex. They also work together to reorganize actin filaments in order to traffic more proteins by vesicle to continue the growth of filaments. Cofilin also binds with other proteins such as myosin, tropomyosin, α-actinin, gelsolin and scruin. These proteins compete with cofilin for actin binding. Сofilin also play role in innate immune response. In a Model Organism ADF/cofilin is found in ruffling membranes and at the leading edge of mobile cells. In particular, ADF/cofilin promotes disassembly of the filament at the rear of the brush in Xenopus laevis lamellipodia, a protrusion from fibroblast cells characterized by actin networks. Subunits are added to barbed ends and lost from rear-facing pointed ends. Increasing the rate constant, k, for actin dissociation from the pointed ends was found to sever actin filaments. Through this experimentation, it was found that ATP or ADP-Pi are probably involved in binding to actin filaments.  Mechanism of Action  F-actin (filamentous actin) is stabilized when it is bound to ATP due to the presence of a serine on the second subunit of actin that is able to form hydrogen bonds to the last phosphate group in ATP and a nearby histidine attached to the main loop. This interaction stabilizes the structure internally due to the interactions between the main loop and the second subunit. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, the serine can no longer form a hydrogen bond to ADP due to the loss of the inorganic phosphate which causes the serine side chain to twist, causing a conformational change in the second subunit. This conformational change also causes the serine to no longer be able to form a hydrogen bond with the histidine attached to the main loop and this weakens the linkage between subunits one and three, causing the entire molecule to twist. This twisting puts strain on the molecule and destabilizes it. Actin depolymerizing factor is able to bind to the destabilized F-actin by inserting the central helix into the cleft between the first and third subunits of actin. Actin depolymerizing factor binds F-actin cooperatively and induces a conformational change in F-actin that causes it to twist further and become more destabilized. This twisting causes severing of the bond between actin monomers, depolymerizing the filament.  Regulation = Phosphorylation  Actin depolymerization factor is regulated by the phosphorylation of a serine on the C terminus by LIM kinases. Actin depolymerizing factor is activated when it is dephosphorylated and inhibited when it is phosphorylated.  pH  Tropomyosin bound to actin An alkaline environment stabilizes the inorganic phosphate released when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, so therefore a higher pH increases the favorability of the ATP bound to F-actin to be hydrolyzed to ADP resulting in the destabilization of actin.  Tropomyosin binding  F-actin binds the protein Tropomyosin and actin depolymerizing factor competitively and mutually exclusively. F-actin binding of Tropomyosin is uncooperative so therefore the binding of Tropomyosin does not induce a conformational change in F-actin and does not cause it to become destabilized. However, because F-actin cannot bind both Tropomyosin and actin depolymerizing factor at the same time due to Tropomyosin blocking the binding site of actin depolymerizing factor when it is bound to actin, Tropomyosin acts as a protector of actin against depolymerization.

Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex), the company's rail transport division, operates the nation's largest rail fleet. History The company was founded by Raúl Antonio Escobedo and Larrea Mota Velasco in 1978. After the government of Carlos Salinas declared the state mining company bankrupt, Larrea purchased key Mexican copper mines in Cananea and Nacozari (cities in the state of Sonora). He also purchased numerous other mining sites, including coal mines in the state of Coahuila. By 2000, Grupo México was responsible for 87.5 percent of Mexico's copper production and is the world's third-largest copper producer. Grupo México has been in continual conflict with Local 65, the Cananea branch of the Mexican Mine Workers' Union (SNTMMSRM). During miners' strikes in January 2003 and October 2004, Grupo México responded with threats to close the Cananea mines. In 2004, Grupo México purchased a controlling interest in the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. Grupo Mexico acquired 54.2% equity interest in Southern Peru Copper Corporation from ASARCO LLC, a mining company operating in the United States. The SPCC equity sale is subject to a litigation between Grupo Mexico and ASARCO pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas under District Court Judge Andrew Hanen. As of September 2009, ASARCO was the focus of a bidding war begun in May 2008 between its own parent company Grupo México and India-based Sterlite Industries. On August 31, 2009, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt recommended that U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen accept Grupo México's $2.5 billion bid for ASARCO as it prepares to come out of bankruptcy. Pollution and environmental issues=Cases in the US through ASARCO These talls smokestacks at Asarco's El Paso Smeltertown site were brought down in 2013.

Cases in MexicoPasta de Conchos mine disaster= On February 19, 2006, an explosion occurred in a coal mine in San Juan de Sabinas, Coahuila, that is owned by Grupo México. It was reported that mine workers had gone on strike against Grupo México at least 14 times, \\"not only for salary increases… but because of its constant refusal to review security and health measures.\\" Grupo México said that they, in conjunction with the mining union, signed a certificate on February 7, 2006 declaring the mine safe.Search for Mexican miners suspended Diario, Ciudad Juárez, February 25, 2006. Although the mining operations of a coal deposit is always a risky business, due to the possibility of huge gas concentrations, there are certain theories that indicate the mine has an important lack of safety rules, very similar to the problem presented in the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia with the accident that caused death of 12 miners on January 2, 2006. Union critics of the company openly refer to the incident as a \\"homicide.\\" After the successful rescue of 33 trapped miners in October 2010 in Copiapó, Chile, the case gained popularity again, and many people including bishop Raúl Vera demanded that the case be reopened. Grupo México has not responded.Chilean rescue revives anger in Mexico over 2006 miners' tragedy, Monsters and Critics, October 14, 2010. According to the IndustriALL Global Union, as of August 2016, \\"Ten years after the mining homicide at Pasta de Conchos, Mexico, the government has still not conducted a thorough investigation into the real causes of the disaster, brought those responsible to justice, recovered the bodies or compensated the families of the victims.\\" =Rio Sonora spill= On August 6, 2014 40,000 cubic meters of copper sulphate were spilled on Sonora River and Bacanuchi River by Buenavista del Cobre mine. This has been considered the largest environmental spillage in Mexico's history, polluting 7 municipal districts from Sonora state and affecting by October more than 20,000 people. Pollution has been reported to be reaching Arizona. Though a trustfund was created to assist the damaged population, complains about its management and proper ecological cleaning have been expressed.\\"Nos estan dejando morir.

It is situated within Jurong Point Shopping Mall and integrated with the nearby Boon Lay MRT station. This interchange serves a variety of passengers, including those from Nanyang Technological University, Jurong Industrial Estate and Tuas Industrial Estate. The interchange has been among the largest and busiest bus interchanges in Singapore, handling 31 services in the past until a few services were amended to the newer Joo Koon Bus Interchange in 2015. History Boon Lay Bus Interchange began operating on 1 July 1990 with services that used to terminate at the former Jurong Bus Interchange at Jurong Port Road and Jurong East Bus Interchange being re-routed to terminate there. That time, the Jurong West extension and Tuas Industrial area was still largely under development. As both areas are undergoing development, more bus services were introduced and by the early 2000s, there were about 30 bus services terminating at the interchange. That time, there used to be an empty land beside the former interchange. In 2006, the land where the former interchange sits at and the land beside it was sold together as a 'White site' to Prime Point Development Pte. Ltd. and soon the land where the former interchange sits at was acquired to construct the Jurong Point Extension. The old bus interchange The temporary bus interchange which operated from 18 June 2006 to 26 December 2009 From 18 June 2006 to 26 December 2009, the interchange had it operations temporarily next to Boon Lay MRT station, at an empty plot of land surrounded by Boon Lay Way and Jurong West Street 64 while the bus interchange was being rebuilt as part of the Jurong Point extension project and this project consisted of the extension of Jurong Point (JP2),the new Boon Lay Bus Interchange and a 16-storey condominium that is known as 'The Centris'. On 27 December 2009, the interchange moved back to its original location and all operations (except for bus Service 179, 179A and 199 which continued to operate at the temporary interchange till 7 May 2010) resumed at the re-constructed interchange located along Jurong West Central 3. Built over 20,000 square metres, it is Singapore's fourth air conditioned bus interchange and the first along the East West Line. In total, it has 60 bus bays and 31 boarding/alighting wheelchair accessible berths with 22 of them being end-on and 9 of them being sawtooth (6 for boarding and 3 for alighting). Together with Boon Lay MRT station and Jurong Point, it is part of the Boon Lay Integrated Public Transport Hub. With the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange on 21 November 2015, Services 182, 182M, 254, 255 and 257 were relocated to Joo Koon Bus Interchange. It reduced overcrowding at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. A further change was made on 18 June 2017 with the opening of Tuas West Extension, Services 256 and 258 were merged into service 258 and skipped the interchange.2 new bus services for Tuas West Extension Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all the bus routes were split into 9 route packages - 79 under Bulim, 172 and 180 under Choa Chu Kang-Bukit Panjang, 178 and 187 under Woodlands, 30 under Bedok, 154 under Serangoon- Eunos, 157 is under Bishan-Toa Payoh, 174/e under Clementi, 198 under Bukit Merah and the rest are under Jurong West Bus Packages.

The episode was the 16th episode for the show's second season. The episode was written by Bruce Zimmerman and was directed by Randy Zisk. It originally aired on Sunday, March 12, 2006. Plot Paul Young is visited by Detective Sullivan and is asked to accompany him to the police station for suspicious credit card behavior. Paul denies this but is forced to go anyway. When they arrive at the police station, the registering officer informs Sullivan there is no room left for Paul and to take him out of the city. Paul is then put into a prison transfer bus and is surprised when one of the prisoners tells him that Dierdre's father knows and that he is angry. Off camera there is sounds of a struggle and a fight ensues when one of the prisoners takes out a knife. Zach begins to worry about his father when he fails to arrive home. Felicia Tilman arrives back on Wisteria Lane and wants to help Zach as does Mike Delfino. Just as Mike breaks the news that Paul is missing from police custody, Paul walks out of a police car. Apparently, Paul fought off the two prisoners and is freed when the police find him and believe his arrest was an error. Mike then warns Paul that he must be careful with Noah since he is still very powerful and has connections. Zach then agrees to meet Noah so that they can settle the matter once and for all. Mike and Zach go to visit a frail Noah and immediately Zach tells Noah that the only reason they are meeting is that he wants him to promise to not hurt his dad. Noah reminds Zach that he has two fathers but Zach says he does not want him to hurt the dad that raised him. Mike is hurt at Zach's answer and leaves the room. On Wisteria Lane, Bree's trouble with alcohol is becoming known to the other neighbors due to her negligence after watching the Scavo children. When she talks to her friends they know she is lying because they smell alcohol on her breath. When Andrew's ride to school moves out of town, he asks his mother if she can withdraw money from his trust fund so that he can buy a car. She refuses which leads to Andrew calling her a mean, old drunk. Bree disciplines Andrew by slapping him in the face. Later, Andrew gives Justin a ring so that he can punch him in the face where his mother had hit him. The following day, Andrew hires a lawyer because he wants to be emancipated due to her abusive behavior. Andrew then arrives in the living room with a black eye and bruised face. Bree looks at Andrew in horror when he reminds her that he was hit by her. At the table, Andrew's lawyer warns Bree if they cannot settle the matter out of court they will have no problems making a court case. Bree sees this as a threat and in order to make herself appear sober she reluctantly joins Alcoholics Anonymous and so Andrew can't use her drinking against her in court. However, after her first meeting, she takes out a bottle of wine from her bathroom cabinet and begins to drink. Susan is admitted to the hospital for her splenectomy and is soon showered with flowers by Dr. Ron who wants to move further in their relationship. Susan is happy about this but remembers that she is still married to Karl. When Karl comes to visit Susan at the hospital, he teases her about the romantic card Dr. Ron sent. After Karl leaves, he tells the nurse to keep an eye on his \\"wife\\". The nurse, who in the past has had feelings for Dr. Ron, is upset that Susan is cheating. She then goes into Susan's bedroom and tells her that she knows Susan is married. Susan then runs after her and asks her not to tell Dr. Ron since the marriage is fake. The nurse agrees only to be sure she is not \\"two-timing\\" him. As Susan goes into surgery, she sees Mike in the waiting room and her feelings for him come back. On the operating table, Susan expresses her love for Mike which leads to awkwardness with Dr. Ron. Nurse Hizel then lets out that Susan is married and is upset that he always has such poor taste in women. Tom begins to show great resentment towards Lynette since she is always \\"the boss\\" both at home and at the workplace. During sex, Tom whines that Lynette has to be on top and be in control. Lynette is resentful at this but Tom is tired of it. The following morning while they are on the elevator, Tom stops it and tells Lynette that they were not finished from the night before. In order to save the marriage, Tom asks Lynette if he can be in control for once and they proceed to have sex in the elevator. Gabrielle and Carlos visit an adoption clinic where they are told to provide a packet of photos to ensure they are qualified parents. They do so by asking Lynette if they can pretend to be the children's godparents. Gabrielle and Carlos manage to win over the adoption clerk but when Helen Rowland walks in, she informs the clerk that Gabrielle \\"raped\\" her son and that Carlos was incarcerated last year on slave labor charges. The clerk dismisses the case and Gabrielle & Carlos are out of luck. They are then forced to turn to an adoption lawyer who will happily find them a baby for a large sum of money.

Robert Rynk (June 1992), In-vessel composting systems can consist of metal or plastic tanks or concrete bunkers in which air flow and temperature can be controlled, using the principles of a \\"bioreactor\\". Generally the air circulation is metered in via buried tubes that allow fresh air to be injected under pressure, with the exhaust being extracted through a biofilter, with temperature and moisture conditions monitored using probes in the mass to allow maintenance of optimum aerobic decomposition conditions. This technique is generally used for municipal scale organic waste processing, including final treatment of sewage biosolids, to a safe stable state for reclamation as a soil amendment. In-vessel composting can also refer to aerated static pile composting with the addition of removable covers that enclose the piles, as with the system in extensive use by farmer groups in Thailand, supported by the National Science and Technology Development Agency there.Aerated Static Pile composting Offensive odors are caused by putrefaction (anaerobic decomposition) of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter gassing off as ammonia. This is controlled with a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio, or increased aeration by ventilation, and use of a coarser grade of carbon material to allow better air circulation. Prevention and capture of any gases naturally occurring (volatile organic compounds) during the hot aerobic composting involved is the objective of the biofilter, and as the filtering material saturates over time, it can be used in the composting process and replaced with fresh material. A more advanced systems design is able to limit the odor issues considerably, and it is also able to raise the total energy and resource output by integrating in-vessel composting with anaerobic digestion. Through anaerobic decomposition it is also possible to reduce pathogen levels similarly to that of traditional aerated composting when the anaerobic bioreactors operate at thermophilic temperatures, between 41 and 122 °C (106 and 252 °F).§https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260994304_Potential_for_Pathogen_reduction_in_anaerobic_digestion_and_biogas_generation_in_Sub- Saharan_Africa https://www.ijcmas.com/vol-2-12/Teodora%20Petrova%20%20Popova,%20et%20al.pdf Gallery Image:CVRD1loader.5bays.jpg Biosolids composting facility - receiving and mixing bays and 5 reactor chambers Image:CVRD2week1bay.jpg Composting chamber material after 1 week Image:CVRD3week2.bay.jpg Composting chamber material after 2 weeks Image:CVRD4chamber.air.jpg Air supply and exhaust system for enclosed composting Image:CVRD5biofilter.air.exhaust.jpg Exhaust biofilter mound  See also  *Aerated static pile composting *Anaerobic digestion *Compost *List of solid waste treatment technologies *Mechanical biological treatment *Waste management *Windrow composting References External links  * Composting Association UK Category:Industrial composting Category:Waste treatment technology ","title":"In-vessel composting"},{"id":"4135978","text":"Arfa Abdul Karim Randhawa (; 2 February 1995 – 14 January 2012) was a Pakistani student and computer prodigy who became the youngest Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) in 2004.

Under his reign, Salerno entered an era of great splendour. Opulenta Salernum was the inscription on his coins. He made Amalfi, Gaeta and Sorrento his vassals and annexed much of Byzantine Apulia and Calabria. He was the second eldest son of Prince John II of Salerno. The eldest was Guy, who ruled as co-ruler with his father from January 984 to 988. Sometime between January and March 989, John made Guaimar co-regent. In 994 (also given as 998 or 999), his father died and he became sole ruler. In 999, a band of Norman pilgrims returning from Jerusalem stopped at the port of Salerno. While they were staying there, the city was attacked by Saracen pirates. The Salernitans were afraid to offer battle, but the warlike Normans were not. Soon their bravery drew out the Salernitans and together they routed the Muslim force. Guaimar promptly offered the Normans numerous incentives to stay, but to no avail. Before they left, however, the Normans promised to spread the word about the need for fighting men in the south. As a member of the independent Lombard leadership of the Mezzogiorno, Guaimar supported the Lombard rebel Melus of Bari. After Melus's defeat in 1011, Guaimar was paid a visit by the victorious Byzantine catapan, Basil Mesardonites, in October. Later, he sheltered Melus. Guaimar was nominally a vassal of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, but after the defeat at Cannae in 1018, he discreetly transferred his allegiance to the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. When Henry died in 1024, Guaimar sent an embassy to the new emperor, Conrad II, to plead for the release of his brother-in-law Pandulf IV of Capua, the Wolf of the Abruzzi. Conrad naively complied. Upon his return, Pandulf immediately put his old capital, Capua, under siege, an endeavour in which he had the support of Guaimar and his Normans under Ranulf Drengot and the catepan of Italy, Boiannes. In 1015, Guaimar made his eldest son by his first wife, Porpora of Tabellaria (d.c.1010), co-prince as John III. In 1018, however, John died. Guaimar then made co-prince his eldest son by his second wife, Gaitelgrima, the sister of Pandulf. It was this son, also named Guaimar, who succeeded him in 1027 at the age of fourteen or sixteen under the regency of Gaitelgrima, who was basically the pawn of her brother Pandulf. Guaimar III's second son, Guy, was made gastald of Capua by his uncle and later duke of Sorrento by his elder brother. His third son, Pandulf, became lord of Capaccio (his daughter Theodora became the second wife of Geoffrey of Hauteville). He had a daughter (probably about 1026) named Gaitelgrima, who married successively the brothers Drogo and Humphrey, counts of Apulia. References *Gwatkin, H.M., Whitney, J.P. (ed) et al.

In 1871 the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was built through the flourishing settlement and in 1878 Woodville became a police village. Woodville had a town hall, lock-up, grist-mill, two foundries, a cheese factory, planing mill and sash and door factory, a number of dry goods stores, mechanics' shops, and three hotels. It also had its own brick school house, with two teachers, and two churches – one Presbyterian, the other Methodist. Today, the cheese factory, rail station, gristmill, mechanics shops, and hotels have all been shut down. Woodville now is home to two restaurants, one variety store, a post office, a bank, a curling rink and arena, two baseball diamonds and a newer school, first built in 1923.

The engine output in this case will always remain the same, but when atmospheric conditions such as high temperatures and high altitude (\\"hot and high\\") reduce the power output of the engine it has more headroom before it falls below the limited maximum output. In some cases the total power output of an engine needs to be constrained because the airframe can only handle a certain force. This is the case with gas turbine engines. Flat rating allows airplanes to operate under more demanding conditions, without the need for extra structural strengthening due to higher peak power output of the engine. For example, the Garrett AiResearch TPE-331-5 engine originally fitted on the Dornier 228 produces . If the outside air temperature is above 20°C, the airplane's maximum speed is reduced by approximately 10 knots (19 km/h), because hotter air is less dense and thus produces less pressure inside the turbine.

It has offices and facilities in the United States, South America, Asia, and Europe. BioMarin's core business and research is in enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs). BioMarin was the first company to provide therapeutics for mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), by manufacturing laronidase (Aldurazyme, commercialized by Genzyme Corporation). BioMarin was also the first company to provide therapeutics for phenylketonuria (PKU).https://headtopics.com/uk/a-wonder-drug-helped-me-eat- then-i-had-to-go-without-5365155 Over the years, BioMarin has been criticised for drug pricing and for specific instances of denying access to drugs in clinical trials. History BioMarin was founded in 1997 by Christopher Starr Ph.D. and Grant W. Denison Jr. with an investment of a $1.5 million from Glyko Biomedical and went public in 1999. Seed investors were amongst others MPM Bioventures, Grosvenor Fund and Florian Schönharting. Business development In 2002, BioMarin acquired Glyko Biomedical. In 2009, BioMarin acquired Huxley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Huxley), which had rights to a proprietary form of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), amifampridine phosphate. In 2010, BioMarin was granted marketing approval by the European Commission for 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), amifampridine phosphate for the treatment of the rare autoimmune disease Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). BioMarin launched the product under the name Firdapse. In 2010, BioMarin acquired LEAD Therapeutics, Inc. (LEAD), a small private drug discovery and early stage development company with key compound LT-673, an orally available poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor studied for the treatment of patients with rare, genetically defined cancers. This acquisition was followed by the purchase of ZyStor Therapeutics, Inc. (ZyStor), a privately held biotechnology company developing ERTs for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and its lead product candidate, ZC-701, a fusion of insulin-like growth factor 2 and alpha glucosidase (IGF2-GAA) in development for Pompe disease. At its R&D; day in October 2010, BioMarin also announced a new program for a peptide therapeutic, vosoritide (BMN-111), for the treatment of achondroplasia. In 2012, BioMarin acquired Zacharon Pharmaceuticals, a private biotechnology company based in San Diego focused on developing small molecules targeting pathways of glycan metabolism. In 2014, BioMarin acquired a histone deacetylase inhibitor chemical library from Repligen for $2 million with the intention of advancing work toward therapies for Friedreich's ataxia and other neurological disorders. In November 2014, the company agreed to the acquisition of Prosensa for up to $840 million; however, the range of treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy failed to attain FDA approval, and development ceased in May 2016. In October 2019 it was revealed that the group will open an office in Dublin to support further growth through Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Acquisition history The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list): Products As of 2016, BioMarin has six products on the market, each of which is an orphan drug.BioMarin Office Site: Products *Tetrahydrobiopterin (branded as Kuvan) (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a small molecule drug for phenylketonuria, introduced in 2007 as the first medication- based intervention to treat phenylketonuria *Arylsulfatase B (branded as Naglazyme) (galsulfase), a recombinant protein therapeutic for Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome (also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VI) *Iduronidase (branded as Aldurazyme), a recombinant protein therapeutic for mucopolysaccharidosis I *Amifampridine (branded as Firdapse), a small molecule drug for Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (as of 2013 approved in the EU only) *Elosulfase alfa (branded as Vimizim), is the only enzyme replacement therapy to address the cause of Morquio A Syndrome (MPS IVA), which affects an estimated 3,000 patients in the developed world. The disease occurs as a result of a deficiency of activity in an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. *Cerliponase alfa (branded as Brineura), is an enzyme replacement treatment for Batten disease, which is a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. It was approved in 2017. Biomarin is working to develop several new drugs. *Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec is an experimental drug under investigation for treatment of hemophilia A. It is an adeno-associated viral vector that aims to transfer a working copy of the Factor VIII gene into patients who lack one. Controversies In 2010, BioMarin became involved in controversy surrounding 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP). BioMarin markets a phosphate salt of 3,4-DAP under the name Firdapse. In 2010, BioMarin was granted exclusive licensing rights to Firdapse for 10 years. As a result, the price of a prescribed National Health Service treatment course has increased from $1,987 for the unlicensed drug to $69,970 for Firdapse. The company states that prior to its licensing, there was no guaranteed quality control of the product and no way of formally monitoring for uncommon side effects through the regulatory process. In 2013, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals was at the center of a high profile debate regarding expanded access of cancer patients to experimental drugs. On the advice of her doctor, Andrea Sloan, a patient with advanced ovarian cancer, requested that the company provide her with access to BMN 673, an unapproved PARP inhibitor drug candidate that had exhibited promising activity in a small Phase 1 clinical trial. The company declined, citing safety concerns. Ms. Sloan eventually received a similar drug candidate from a different company.Ed Silverman for Pharmalot. October 4, 2013 Andrea Sloan, 'Poster Child' For Compassionate Use, Gets A Drug In 2015, there was another controversy over expanded access, concerning the supply of a drug on clinical trial to a German child who was suffering from a brain disorder but who was not part of the trial. In April 2019, the BBC reported that patients who took part in a trial treatment for the drug Kuvan (sapropterin hydrochloride) were later denied access to it. The company was criticised by the NHS and Stephen Hammond MP for patient profiteering. The company commented the following in response: \\"BioMarin is disappointed that the NHS England has not recognised the value of treating PKU patients with Kuvan, despite more than a decade of positive patient outcomes across 26 countries in Europe, Russia and Turkey\\" In June 2019, a Belgian court ordered BioMarin to continue supplying Vimizim to a young girl suffering from Morquio syndrome free of charge. BioMarin stopped providing free Vimizim at the beginning of the year after negotiations with Belgian health authorities regarding reimbursement of the product repeatedly failed. This caused the parents to start legal proceedings to force the company to keep providing the medicine free of charge. BioMarin was ordered in a preliminary injunction to keep doing so until a definitive judgment would be rendered, or until the medicine would be available on the Belgian market at a reasonable price.

They are a medium-sized brown owl and have a characteristic voice with calls ranging from a barking dog noise to a shrill human-like howl of great intensity. For a short period before 2016, the Red List of Threatened Species referred to this species as the \\"barking boobook\\". However, this is not used as a common name in Australia or other English speaking areas in this species range and has now been corrected to barking owl. Taxonomy The barking owl was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 with the binomial name Falco connivens. Latham commented that the species \\"Inhabits New Holland, but no history annexed, further than that it has a wonderful faculty of contracting and dilating the iris: and that the native name is Goora-a-Gang.\\" The specific epithet is the Latin connivens 'winking'. There are four subspecies: * N. c. rufostrigata (Gray, GR, 1861) - north Maluku Islands * N. c. assimilis Salvadori & D'Albertis, 1875 - east New Guinea, Manam, Karkar and Daru Islands * N. c. peninsularis Salvadori, 1876 - north Australia * N. c. connivens (Latham, 1801) - southwest, east and southeast Australia Description The barking owl is coloured brown with white spots on its wings and a vertically streaked chest. They have large eyes that have a yellow iris, a discrete facial mask and yellow skin on the feet. Their underparts are brownish-grey and coarsely spotted white with their tail and flight feathers being strongly banded brown and white. They are a robust, medium-sized owl long and their wingspan is between .Higgins, P.J.,ed. (1999). Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds. Volume 4: Parrots to Dollarbird.

Size varies only slightly between the male and female birds with the male barking owl being 8-10 % heavier. They are one of only a handful of owl species exhibiting normal sexual dimorphism. In a banding study conducted in the Pilliga forests of northern New South Wales, males averaged with females averaging [p20]. In Australia, the smallest barking owls are found on Cape York Peninsula and the largest in southern Australia. Distribution and Habitat The barking owl lives in mainland Australia along the eastern and northern coast of the continent and the southwest areas surrounding Perth, Western Australia. Inland they occupy areas near lakes and waterways or other wooded environments. They also live in drier parts of Papua New Guinea and the Moluccas (Halmahera, Morotai, Bacan and Obi). Once widespread, barking owls are now less common in southern mainland Australia. They choose to live in forests or woodland areas that have large trees for nesting and foliage cover for roosting. They often reside near river, swamp or creek beds as these features often have large trees with hollows required for nesting and the productivity to support sufficient prey. The only detailed studies of barking owl home-ranges have been conducted in southern Australia where the species is declining. In northern Victoria, barking owl pairs were found to average a home-range of with little overlap between pairs. Foraging was concentrated within forested areas of each home range.Schedvin (2007) Distributional ecology of the barking owl in Victoria, Australia. PhD thesis, Charles Sturt University These results are mirrored in the Pilliga forests of Northern NSW although there the home ranges were larger, often up to .Kavanagh, R., & Stanton, M. A. (2009) \\"Conserving barking owls in the Pilliga Forests.\\" Wingspan 19(2): 28-30. ISSN 1036-7810 Although barking owls are uncommon and sometimes even rare in many suburban areas, they occasionally do get accustomed to humans and even start to nest in streets or near farm houses. Behaviour=Diet The barking owl has one of the broadest diets of any Australian owl. Barking owls hunt in timbered and open habitats but usually rely on trees as hunting perches. Their diet includes prey taken from the ground, the trees, the surface of waterbodies, and directly from the air. In some locations mammals make up the majority of prey biomass with prey sizes from mice and small carnivorous marsupials up to rabbits and brushtail possums around a kilogram or more in weight. Sugar gliders are a frequent prey item. Bats of all sizes are also commonly taken. In some areas, bird prey items make a sizeable contribution to the diet. Birds up to the size of sulphur-crested cockatoos (~800 grams) and ducks are taken, but many smaller birds are more commonly taken. One frequent prey item is the tawny frogmouth, a nocturnal bird of Australian forests and woodlands. Insect prey items can dominate the prey item count. Beetles and moths are commonly taken on the wing. A range of other insects are also consumed. Occasionally frogs, reptiles, fish or crustaceans are eaten. In summary, if an animal can be detected by a barking owl and it is of its size or smaller, it can be considered as potential prey.[pp8–11, 35-77] Breeding The breeding season of the barking owl is from July to September in the north of Australia and from August to October in the south.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. The nest is formed of decayed debris, usually in the large hollow of an old eucalypt near a river.Pizzey, Graham and Doyle, Roy. (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. A clutch of 2 or 3 roundish, dull-white eggs, each measuring , is laid and incubated by the female for about 36 days. The young at first are covered in white down and fledge by 5 to 6 weeks. Voice Most people hear the barking owl rather than see it as it has a loud and explosive voice. The main territorial vocalisation is in the form of a double 'hoot', similar in pattern to the other Australian hawk owls. It sounds like a double dog bark that so closely resembles a small dog that it is difficult to tell the difference. The barking owl name is derived from these calls. Males 'bark' at a lower pitch than females, particularly when a pair perform the barking calls together. Barking calls can be varied in pitch and intensity depending on the purpose of the call. Loud barks are given as territorial calls and can be used in confrontations between pairs in adjacent territories. Lower pitched softer barks are often used around the nest or roost areas by the male to call the female for a meal. Barking owls also have a range of other vocalisations. These might be described as growls, howls or screams and bleating and twittering. Growls and howls are part of a continuum of calls relating to threats, particularly during nesting. The level of the threat, typically determines the level of the call, with the lowest level being a low pitched and soft growl. This is usually a warning note to the nesting partner. This climbs into a louder and higher pitched series of howls, often made while the owl dives at the intruder. At its most extreme, this might be described as a scream. The screaming of the barking owl is said to sound like a woman or child screaming in pain. Hearings of 'screaming lady,' as it is so nicknamed, are rare and many only hear the sound once in their life even if they live next to a barking owl nest. While screams are usually related to nest defence, some barking owls will make this call in non-nest related situations. Myths surround the events that caused the owl to originally \\"mimic\\" the sounds. Juvenile barking owls have a twittering, insect like call when begging for food. It is similar to that of other juvenile hawk owls.Hollands (2008), Owls, Frogmouths and Nightjars of Australia, Bloomings Books, Female barking owls will often make a gentle bleating sound when receiving food from the male owl. An excited variation of this sound is made during copulation. Barking owl Conservation status Barking owls are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. However, their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example: * The barking owl is listed as 'Threatened' on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria (2005) Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria (2006) * On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the barking owl is listed as endangered. * The barking owl is listed as 'Vulnerable' under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.NSW Scientific Committee (1998) \\"Final Determination of Barking Owl.\\" https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/Topics/Animals-and-plants/Threatened- species/NSW-Threatened-Species-Scientific-Committee/Determinations/Final- determinations/1996-1999/Barking-Owl-Ninox-connivens-vulnerable-species- listing This listing was transferred to the equivalent schedules under the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act (2016) from August 2017. * The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2010 Garnett S., Szabo J., and Dutson G. (2010) The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2010, CSIRO Publishing/Birds Australia. http://www.publish.csiro.au/pid/6781.htm lists the barking owl southern sub- species as 'near threatened'. Decline and extent In the State of Victoria, according to Action Statement 116 issued under the FFG Act: \\"The Barking Owl is the most threatened owl in Victoria. The population has been estimated to be fewer than 50 breeding pairs (Silveira et al. 1997), though work in north-eastern Victoria (Taylor et al. 1999; ) suggests that this estimate may have been conservative in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Existing records of Barking Owls on the Atlas of Victorian Wildlife database (NRE 2001) are unlikely to give an accurate representation of the current distribution and abundance of the species. Many of these records are dated, occurring in areas where once-suitable habitat has been lost or degraded. Extensive surveys in Victorian forests have shown the species to be rare, localised and mainly found in north-eastern Victoria (Loyn et al. 2001).\\" A similar pattern of decline is evident in NSW with surveys in 1998, 2004 and 2008 showing barking owls to be rare in areas that had been assumed to be strongholds. Larger population areas have been demonstrated to be isolated from one another. In south-western Australia a survey (in the late 1990s) of 100 forest sites found no barking owls.Liddelow, G.L., Wheeler, I.B., and Kavanagh, R.P. (2002) \\"Owls in the southwest forests of Western Australia.\\" In Ecology and Conservation of Owls. (Eds. I. Newton, R. Kavanagh, J. Olsen and I. R. Taylor) pp. 233-241. (CSIRO Publishing: Collingwood, Vic.) In contrast (as of 2012), barking owl calls are still a common sound in many wooded parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, although there have been few recent published population studies/surveys in those areas. Threatening processes According to the Action Statement No. 116 made under the state of Victoria, the primary threat to the barking owl is loss of habitat, particularly the deterioration or loss of the large, hollow-bearing trees on which the species depends for nesting. Hollows suitable for nesting for owls do not form in eucalypts until they are at least 150–200 years old (Parnaby 1995). Similarly, hollows are an important resource for many prey species of the barking owl, e.g. gliders and possums. Such trees are not being regrown rapidly enough to exceed expected losses in the next century. The removal of dead, standing trees and stags for firewood is also likely to remove nesting sites for the species. Native prey species such as arboreal mammals and hollow-nesting birds have declined in some areas through clearing of native vegetation, loss of hollows and the impact of introduced predators. These declines may also have contributed to the decline of the barking owl, although in some areas European rabbits have become a substitute prey, and local populations of the barking owl have become heavily dependent upon them. It is not known how the owls will fare through periods of rabbit decline due to climate fluctuations, control programs or disease such as calicivirus. Where poisons are used to control rabbits, secondary poisoning of owls may be an issue. Mythology In the early settlement of Australia a screaming noise matching the barking owl's description was credited and told to the settlers by the Indigenous Australians or the Aboriginals as the bunyip. The bunyip was said to be a fearsome creature that inhabited swamps, rivers and billabongs. Bunyips had many different descriptions but most were of an animal of some sort whose favorite food was that of human women. The cries and noises coming from swamps and creeks at night were not said to be the victims but actually the noise the bunyip made. It is believed by many that the sound is of the nocturnal barking owl and that proves the location, the noises and the rarity of the bunyip cries. It is still not proven though that the barking owl actually started the bunyip story and it could be due to other sources. But it seems that the barking owl will stay as the most likely explanation. Myths surround the events that caused the owl to originally \\"mimic\\" the screaming sounds.

Its figurines were first released in the 1950s with the development, production and marketing of comic figurines such as Snoopy and the Smurfs. In the early 1980s they added animal figurines and Muppet characters to their range of products. Until the end of 2006, Schleich was a family-owned business. It was then taken over by the British investment company HgCapital,Playthings article on Schleich takeover who paid 165 million euro for an 80% share.HG Capital press release on the acquisition of Schleich Design, production and materials The design of products and the creation of tooling is mostly in-house.

Schleich toys are made of polyvinyl chloride, PVC. PVC is commonly used in the construction industry for plumbing water lines in homes and businesses. They also add a softener developed by BASF called Hexamoll® DINCH®.Schleich Materials This softener is not only used in toys but also for food packaging and for use in the medical field for blood product packaging and breathing tubes. Product lines The current line of figurines now includes six major brands owned by Schleich: * WildlifeWild Life * Farm World * Horse Club * Dinosaurs * Bayala * Eldrador Creatures They also have a licensing agreement to produce smurfs. In the past, Schleich has licensed brands including Marvel, DC, Disney and Peanuts. The first major success for Schleich was JOPO, which were bendy figures with long legs. From there, they met success with their first launch of smurf figures. Since then, they have worked with a variety of brands to bring characters to life. But Schleich's overall success today is a result of its animal figures.

The official name is Sunday NFL Countdown presented by Snickers. The show airs on ESPN, ESPN HD, TSN and TSN HD from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern time every Sunday during the National Football League regular season. In Europe it is aired by ESPN America. Format and History It is very similar to The NFL Today on CBS and Fox NFL Sunday, which airs on Fox. The show's former names include NFL GameDay from 1985 to 1995, NFL Countdown from 1996 to 1997, and since 1998, Sunday NFL Countdown (to demarcate from the Monday night version of the series). In 2006, the program introduced new graphics and a new logo to resemble the network's Monday Night Football logo. Chris Berman was the studio host from 1986-2016, succeeding Bob Ley. Jack Youngblood was the first analyst. In 1987, he was replaced by Pete Axthelm and Tom Jackson. The show's awards include seven Sports Emmy Awards for Outstanding Weekly Show (1988, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2001, 2003, and 2006 seasons) and five CableACE Awards (1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 seasons). In February 2007, ESPN confirmed an earlier report in the Dallas Morning News that Michael Irvin would not be brought back to the show or to the network. On March 12, ESPN confirmed on its website that Michael Irvin's former teammate, Emmitt Smith would fill Irvin's chair, but that arrangement only lasted one season.Ex-Cowboys great Smith joins ESPN as NFL analyst Keyshawn Johnson also joined the network and has served as an analyst for Countdown, among other programs. On September 7, 2014, which was the 35th anniversary of ESPN's launch, Sunday NFL Countdown debuted a brand-new studio inside Digital Center 2 of ESPN's main facilities in Bristol. With it, came a new logo and also, a new graphics package similar to that of SportsCenter. Like SportsCenter, a Helvetica font is used, but with the lower-thirds having white text on a black background, as opposed to black text on a white background. Starting September 8, every NFL show produced at ESPN now shares its new graphics, new logo, and a new set (except Monday Night Countdown, which itself shares the same graphics package and theme music as Monday Night Football). On September 13, 2015, Sunday NFL Countdown was shortened from 3 hours to 2 hours, due to a new Sunday edition of NFL Insiders being aired in the 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET time slot. Therefore, Sunday NFL Countdown was moved down an hour to 11 a.m. ET. On September 10, 2017, Sunday NFL Countdown moved back to the 10 a.m. ET time slot and became a 3-hour program once again, resulting in the cancellation of NFL Insiders: Sunday Edition after 2 seasons. The show usually originates from Bristol, but it originates in the city hosting the Super Bowl for its Super Bowl edition. On November 20, 2016, the show originated from Mexico City, which was hosting the Monday Night Football game the following night between the Houston Texans and Oakland Raiders. In January 2017, ESPN announced that Berman would leave the show at the end of the 2016-17 season, ending his 31-year tenure as host of this program. Berman was replaced with Samantha Ponder, who had previously co-hosted and contributed to College GameDay from 2012–2016. On September 13, 2020, Sunday NFL Countdown moved from Bristol to the network's South Street Seaport studios in New York City. Its sister Monday night show followed the next day. Both Sunday NFL Countdown & Monday Night Countdown now share the same studio with another ESPN show, First Take. Controversy On July 14, 2003, ESPN announced that Rush Limbaugh would be joining the show as a weekly commentator when it premiered on September 7. Limbaugh would provide the \\"voice of the fan\\" and was supposed to spark debate on the show. On September 28, Limbaugh commented about Donovan McNabb, the quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles: :\\"Sorry to say this, I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team.\\" On October 1, 2003, less than one week after that comment, Limbaugh resigned from ESPN. The following Sunday on air Tom Jackson said about Limbaugh: : \\"Let me just say that it was not our decision to have Rush Limbaugh on this show. I've seen replay after replay of Limbaugh's comments with my face attached as well as that of my colleagues, comments which made us very uncomfortable at the time, although the depth and the insensitive nature of which weren't fully felt until it seemed too late to reply. He was brought here to talk football, and he broke that trust. Rush told us the social commentary for which he is so well known would not cross over to our show, and instead, he would represent the viewpoint of the intelligent, passionate fan.

Mystery play  Through the medieval period churches in Europe frequently performed mystery plays, retelling the stories of the Bible. They developed from the representation of Bible stories in churches with accompanying song. As these liturgical plays became more popular, more vernacular or everyday elements were introduced and non-clergy began to participate. As the dramas became increasingly secular, they began to be performed entirely in the vernacular and were moved out of the churches by the 13th or 14th century. These religious performances were taken over by the guilds, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control they gained the name mystery play. The mystery play developed into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the tradition of acting these plays in cycles on festival days (such as the Feast of Corpus Christi) was established across Europe.  Morality play  By the 15th and 16th century the form had developed into the morality play. These were allegories, in which the protagonists met personifications of various moral attributes, the net effect being the encouragement to live a virtuous life.  Puritan age  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries theatre was generally seen as wicked, and the church made attempts to suppress it. In the United States condemnation of the theatre was widespread in the eighteenth century; in 1794 President Timothy Dwight IV of Yale College in his \\"Essay on the Stage\\" declared that \\"to indulge a taste for playgoing means nothing more or less than the loss of that most valuable treasure: the immortal soul.\\"  Modern  In the twentieth century churches, particularly evangelical churches, rediscovered the use of theatre as a form of outreach and as a valid art form. In Britain in the early twentieth century it was illegal for any human actor to portray a divine personage on stage, placing severe restrictions on Christian theatre. The groundbreaking 1941-1942 radio drama The Man Born to Be King shattered this taboo by not only including Jesus as a character but giving him 'ordinary' speech rather than 'biblical' language. (Radio portrayals were not covered by the law, but the piece drew huge complaints nonetheless.) T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral explored Christian themes of martyrdom and sacrifice as well as church history. In the 1970s, many plays were produced dealing with Christian subjects, notably Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. At approximately the same time, many churches were again turning to drama as a means of outreach, and as a valid art form. Small Christian theatre companies began to spring up in Britain and America. Covenant Players was founded in 1963 to produce Christian plays written by its founder.

In gardening, soil pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of soil, with pH=7 indicating the neutral soil. Therefore acydophobes would prefer pH above 7. Acid intolerance of plants may be mitigated by lime addition and by calcium and nitrogen fertilizers. Acidophobic species are used as a natural instrument of monitoring the degree of acidifying contamination of soil and watercourses. For example, when monitoring vegetation, a decrease of acidophobic species would be indicative of acid rain increase in the area. A similar approach is used with aquatic species. Acidophobes *Whiteworms (Enchytraeus albidus), a popular live food for aquarists, are acidophobes. *Acidophobic compounds are the ones which are unstable in acidic media. *Acidophobic crops: alfalfa, clover  References  *  External links  *Salamanders May One Day Monitor Degradation In Small Streams Category:Physiology ","title":"Acidophobe"},{"id":"4136310","text":"Oakland City Center is an office, shopping and hotel complex in Downtown Oakland, Oakland, California. The complex is the product of a redevelopment project begun in the late 1950s. It covers twelve city blocks between Broadway on the east, Martin Luther King Jr. Way on the west, Frank H. Ogawa Plaza on 14th Street on the north side of the complex and the Oakland Convention Center and Marriott Hotel extend south to 10th Street. An hourly parking garage is located beneath the complex's shopping mall. The mall features an upscale fitness and racquet club, in addition to numerous take-out restaurants and other stores. The complex is served by the 12th Street/Oakland City Center BART station. History Though not actually one of Oakland's neighborhoods, and with only newly established condominium residences, City Center in Oakland has a privately owned outdoor shopping mall at its core. The mall is a textbook example of redevelopment urban land planning policies which started in the mid to late twentieth century and continue into the present. A large section of ornate Victorian and Italianate style apartment buildings, with ground-floor retail shops in the center of Downtown Oakland, was appropriated by the city through the force of eminent domain and demolished to make way for what was originally proposed to be an enclosed shopping mall, high-rise office buildings, a hotel, and an aboveground parking structure. In the draft Central District Plan, the Oakland Redevelopment Agency originally had an ambitious goal of razing 70 city blocks, but neighborhood residents and the Downtown Property Owner's Association objected, and the plan was scaled back to only 12 blocks between 10th and 14th Streets on the west side of Broadway. The redevelopment plan, by William Liskamm and Rai Okamoto, won a 1966 Design Award from Progressive Architecture.\\"The Fourteenth Annual P/A Design Awards Program\\" Pacific Coast Architectural Database As reported in the archives of the Oakland Tribune, residents were evicted from several residential hotels for purported code enforcement reasons under an aggressive plan called \\"Operation Padlock.\\" Several pawnshops and Oakland's Moulin Rouge Theatre were leveled. According to Dr. Richard A. Walker, professor of geography at the University of California, Berkeley, the much-beloved delicatessen, Ratto's, which had been in business since around the turn of the century, was threatened by demolition before citizen protest saved it.Oakland:Dark Star in an Expanding Universe , Richard A. Walker, Department of Geography, University of California, Draft of Nov. 21, 1997 The Clorox Building, viewed from 12th Street The first office building, at 14th and Broadway, opened on December 18, 1973. The first skyscraper, the Clorox Building, opened next door in 1976. However, construction stalled, and by the 1980s the mall still hadn't been built and most of the site was still vacant. The project was redesigned, with a smaller outdoor retail complex and new federal office building replacing the mall, and a partial restoration of the original street grid. Several new buildings were completed in 1990, including the retail complex, named City Square, and 1111 Broadway, the new headquarters of the global shipping company American President Lines (APL). Economic recovery of downtown Oakland was stalled by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and a recession in the early 1990s, and private development at City Center stopped for the next few years. Government payrolls were not affected; the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building complex was completed in 1994, bringing more pedestrian traffic to the struggling mall. 555 City Center. In December 1996, Oakland City Center, including the development rights to the remaining undeveloped parcels, was sold to Shorenstein Properties. The company planned to build four high-rise office buildings on the remaining four lots. Only one was built, 555 City Center, which was completed in 2002. Shorenstein Properties sold the development rights for one of the lots back to the city, which in turn sold it to the Olson Company, which is building market-rate condominiums. Shorenstein Properties is now planning to build market-rate condominiums on one of the two remaining vacant parcels, and an office tower on the other. The latter was approved for construction in late 2007; on October 1, 2008, a groundbreaking gathering occurred for the tower.Expectations still high for Oakland office tower – Inside Bay Area In June 2010 the majority of the City Center was sold to CB Richard Ellis Investors for $360 million.

Liveblogging has increased in usage by news organizations and blogging establishments since the mid-2000s, when they were initially used to broadcast updates of technology conferences in the absence of or alongside streaming video captures, and like microblogs, have gained currency as an online publication format which performs the same function as that of live television news coverage. The BBC uses the word \\"live text\\" for its own liveblogging events. Operation Incorporative of microblogs (which are continuously updated but are also used widely as a short-form liveblogging platform), a liveblog is a single post which is constantly updated by one or more authors (usually on-location correspondents) with up-to-the-minute logs of the goings- on, and are usually performed during specific types of events rather than as regular features. Furthermore, during longer-running events beyond the length of twenty-four hours (such as civil, political or military events), a liveblog post will be ended after a 24-hour period and followed by a successive liveblog post for the next 24 hours. Content and appearance A live blog is a single post which is continuously updated with timestamped micro-updates which are placed above previous micro-updates. During liveblogs, a wide number of media, including video, audio, images and text, can be incorporated in order to explain what is going on at a specific location. Such content may be posted from external sources, such as other press agencies and non-employees, if such content is only available from those sources (i.e., a live blog of an event by Al Jazeera English may post embedded video from CNN or YouTube if such video is centrally relevant to a recent occurrence within the scope of the event and is credited to authors affiliated with such organizations). Live blogs are usually ordered from top-to-bottom so that the most recent updates appear at the top of the post. Posts may also be automatically updated using JavaScript-based auto-refreshes (by the minute) which do not reload the entire webpage. Relevance=Comparison with live broadcasting Because of their synchronous nature, live blogs have been compared to live broadcasting on television and radio in their immediacy and currency. However, such blogs are almost always used for coverage of, and commentary on, one-time or specialized events, and live blogging is not yet widely considered a regular section-specific feature for most online news services, while news specialty channels tend to provide almost 24-hour live studio broadcasts in audio and/or video format without necessarily focusing dedicated coverage on specific current events except when necessary. Usage The format is most regularly used for blow-by-blow coverage of concurrently-occurring events, such as sports competitions. Other events which are increasingly regularly live- blogged are: * Elections * Ceremonies * Conferences, conventions and gatherings * Protests and conflicts * Natural events and disasters * Politically-restive countries The format was originally devised by Gareth Owen for the BBC's coverage of the 2001 UK parliament budget and Owen and the BBC continued to pioneer the format for many years after. The format was later applied by websites such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Techcrunch and Macworld in 2003-2005 for coverage of technology-related events (such as the Macworld Expo's series of Stevenote's and the WWDC) first gained notoriety among news organizations during the coverage of the 2009 anti-government protests in Iran. Further enhancement of the medium by the BBC and other media organizations accompanied later events such as Cablegate and the Arab Spring. The Guardian had been publishing \\"minute-by-minute\\" reports of local (and later locally-involved global) sports events since April 2001, but didn't first begun to publish official \\"minute-by-minutes\\" in the Politics blog until June 2007 (posts titled as \\"LIVE\\" or formatted to give time-stamped updates on events extend to as far as 2003), followed by more Guardian blogs adopting minute-by-minute formats for special events afterward. News organizations have become increasingly adoptive of such platforms as 24liveblog, Livefyre, CoverItLive, Live Blog,Arena and ScribbleLive which allow for a dedicated box in which to publish short-form and mid-form updates with automatic, dynamically-generated appearances of the most recent posts. A recent peer- reviewed publication outlines the utilization and perception of live blogging coverage at a physical therapy conference. The authors concluded that live blogging extended the viewing audience and facilitated viewer engagement. Survey respondents found the coverage educational, of high quality, and would participate again in the future. Impact on journalism The live blogging format is controversial for readers of news websites in that the presentation is a clear departure from more traditional methods of news gathering and presentation, both on- and offline. Matt Wells, blogs editor for The Guardian, contended that live blogs, rather than being the \\"death of journalism\\", will actually be the \\"embodiment of its future\\".

History Olga Loizon founded the first Olga's Kitchen in Birmingham, Michigan in 1970. Loizon developed the chain's recipes in her own basement, using a machine for making souvlaki meat which her uncle had purchased, and sauce inspired by her mother's recipes for yogurt. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the chain expanded through southeastern Michigan and into Illinois. The first one in Florida opened at Clearwater Mall in Clearwater, Florida in 1981. For most of the chain's early history, one of its signature items was \\"Olga Bread\\", a handmade type of bread used on all of the chain's sandwiches, which themselves are called \\"Olgas\\". By 1985, the chain had garnered over $22 million in revenue and had begun franchising. By 1992, the chain had 56 stores in 11 states, and had opened a prototype store at Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights. This number had shrunk by 1999 to 28 stores in four states, although one of the earliest in St. Clair Square in Fairview Heights, Illinois remained open at the time. A 2006 review of the Lansing Mall location in the Lansing State Journal described the chain's signature sandwich, the Original Olga, as \\"a hearty sandwich that is tasty and quite filling.\\" The sandwich, served on the Olga bread, features broiled beef and lamb, onions, tomatoes, and a yogurt-based sauce called Olga Sauce.

Role of Supplementary Eye Field in Saccade Initiation: Executive, Not Direct, Control. J Neurophysiol. Feb 2010;103(2):801-816 The SEF constitutes together with the frontal eye fields (FEF), the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the superior colliculus (SC) one of the most important brain areas involved in the generation and control of eye movements, particularly in the direction contralateral to their location.Emeric, E.

The highlighted area labeled 'EF' is the area he observed to cause eye and head movements when electrically stimulated.Ferrier, D. (1874). Experiments on the Brain of Monkeys.--No. I. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (1854-1905). 23: 409-430. In 1874, David Ferrier, a Scottish neurologist first described the frontal eye fields (FEF). He noted that unilateral electrical stimulation of the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys caused \\"turning of the eyes and head to the opposite side\\" (Fig. 2). The brain area allotted to the FEF by Ferrier's original map was actually quite large and also encompassed the area which we now call the SEF. A century's worth of experimental findings following Ferrier's work have led to shrinking the FEF's size.Rockland, K. S., Kaas, J. H., & Peters, A. (Eds.). (1997). Cerebral Cortex: Volume 12: Extrastriate Cortex in Primates (Vol. 12, pp. 584-585). Springer. During the 1950s, surgical treatment of epileptic patients was being conducted. Neurosurgeons were removing lesions and other parts of the brain thought to be involved in causing the patient's seizures. Treatment of these epileptic patients lead to the discovery of many new brain areas by observant neurosurgeons concerned with the post-surgical implications of removing sections of the brain. Through electrical stimulation studies an area called the supplementary motor area (SMA) was observed and documented by the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield in 1950.Penfield, W. (1950). The supplementary motor area in the cerebral cortex of man. European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience, 185(6), 670-674.Penfield, W. and Welch, K (1951). \\"The supplementary motor area of the cerebral cortex: A clinical and experimental study\\". Am. Med. Ass. Arch. Neurol. Psychiat. 66: 289–317. As Penfield had noted the induction of gaze shifts by stimulation of the rostral part of the SMA, another eye field's existence was postulated. In 1987, the SEF was finally characterized by Schlag and Schlag-Rey as an area where low intensity electrical stimulation could evoke saccades, similar to the FEF. It was named as such to complement the SMA's name. Characteristics=Location Figure 3. Brodmann Brain Map: The SEF is located in the rostral supplementary motor area which corresponds to Area 6 in the above map. For reference, the FEF is located in Area 8. The eye field originally defined by Ferrier's map of the frontal cortex extended medially to the dorsal surface of the brain (Fig. 2). But the FEF proper has since shrunk into the rostral back of the arcuate sulcus (Fig. 1). Experimenters have since established that the FEF and SEF are two separate and distinct brain areas responsible for saccade initiation through cerebral blood flow, and subdural electrode array studies.Melamed, E., & Larsen, B.

Imaging of orbital and visual pathway pathology. Springer. It is located in Brodmann area 6 (BA6) which corresponds to area F7, the premotor cortex.Luppino, G., Rozzi, S., Calzavara, R., & Matelli, M. (2003). Prefrontal and agranular cingulate projections to the dorsal premotor areas F2 and F7 in the macaque monkey (Fig. 3). European Journal of Neuroscience, 17(3), 559-578. Based on single unit recording and microstimulation it has been established that the SEF is caudally contiguous with the parts of the SMA which represent orofacial, and forelimb movements.Schall, J. D. (1991). Neuronal activity related to visually guided saccadic eye movements in the supplementary motor area of rhesus monkeys. Journal of Neurophysiology, 66(2), 530-558. The FEF is located in Brodmann area 8 which is just anterior to the premotor cortex (BA6) (Fig. 3).Amiez, C., & Petrides, M. (2009). Anatomical organization of the eye fields in the human and non-human primate frontal cortex. Progress in Neurobiology, 89(2), 220-230. Role As opposed to the FEF, the SEF plays an indirect but executive role in saccade initiation. For example, the activity of SEF neurons is not sufficient to control saccade initiation in macaque monkeys performing stop signal go/no-go tasks. In this kind of task a trained monkey is to make a particular response (in this case move its eyes, or produce a saccade) to a stimulus on a screen such as a flashing dot. For the go-task, the monkey is to look at the dot. But for the no-go task, the go signal will appear and be followed by the no-go signal, testing whether the saccade initiation can be inhibited.Stuphorn, V., Taylor, T. L., & Schall, J. D. (2000). Performance monitoring by the supplementary eye field. Nature, 408(6814), 857-860. In other words, the SEF does not immediately or directly contribute to saccade initiation. But, the SEF is thought to improve saccade production by using prior knowledge of anticipated task requirements to influence saccadic eye movements. It does so by balancing gaze holding and gaze shifting actions, yielding a modest improvement in performance in stop signal tasks by delaying saccade initiation when necessary. It can be thought that the FEF does the driving part of saccade initiation, while the SEF acts as a backseat passenger, advising the driver as to what to do based on past insights. The SEF has recently been found to encode reward prediction error, suggesting that the SEF may actively evaluate decisions based on a value system on an occulomotor basis, independent of other brain regions.So, N., & Stuphorn, V. (2012). Supplementary eye field encodes reward prediction error. The Journal of Neuroscience, 32(9), 2950-2963. =Significance= The visual system is sensitive to sudden change.Gottlieb, J. P., Kusunoki, M., & Goldberg, M. E. (1998). The representation of visual salience in monkey parietal cortex. Nature, 391(6666), 481-484. If something distracting occurs while a person is performing a task—reading a newspaper, for example—this immediately captures one's attention.Breitmeyer, B. G., & Ganz, L. (1976).

In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 545-552). This sudden shift can be a distraction but it has been also thought to be a reflex of great importance as identifying and reacting to environmental changes quickly (when needed) can be imperative to survival.Schall, J. D., & Thompson, K. G. (1999). Neural selection and control of visually guided eye movements. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 22(1), 241-259.Edelman, G. M. (1987).

Saccadic latency, the time delay between the appearance of a target and the initiation of a saccade, is an important parameter for learning which occulomotor neurons and structures of the brain play what specific roles in saccade initiation.Gaymard, B., Ploner, C.

B., LeBihan, D., & Berthoz, A. (2001). Human cortical networks for new and familiar sequences of saccades. Cerebral Cortex, 11(10), 936-945. There is much research being conducted on the role of SEF in determining visually salient objects and occurrences, using saccadic latency as the parameter of interest.Shook, B.

Supplementary eye field activity reflects a decision rule governing smooth pursuit but not the decision. Journal of neurophysiology, 103(5), 2458-2469. Sensory processes The SEF responds to auditory stimuli as well as visual stimuli. Visual responses from the SEF happen later and are much weaker than that observed in the FEF, though. SEF neurons also exhibit non-retinal modulation including anticipation and reward prediction.Coe, B., Tomihara, K., Matsuzawa, M., & Hikosaka, O. (2002). Visual and anticipatory bias in three cortical eye fields of the monkey during an adaptive decision-making task. The Journal of Neuroscience, 22(12), 5081-5090. Methodology of study=Finding the SEF The SEF was defined by the Schlags as a region where low currents (<50μA) evoke saccades. It is still found using this characterization as well as the known neighboring anatomy (Fig. 1). Monkey models SEF research is conducted mainly in monkey models. Typically trained rhesus macaque monkeys are used and surgically implanted with recording chambers. In this fashion, spike and local field potential (LFP) data can be acquired from SEF neurons, using microelectrodes in the recording chamber. Eye movements can also be monitored using eye- tracking camera equipment. Experiments obviously vary, but to give an example: the monkey might be made to partake in a color visual search task, sitting in front of a computer screen. The monkey would look at a point on the screen which would change from filled in to open at the same time which a colored point of \\"opposite\\" color appears on the screen. The monkey would be rewarded for looking at a new spot—\\"for making a single saccade\\"—within 2000 ms and then fixating on the spot for 500 ms. Varied tasks such as these are used and data is analyzed to determine the SEF's role in saccade initiation, visual saliency, etc.  See also  * Anatomical terms of location * Saccade * Eye movement (sensory) * Smooth pursuit * Frontal eye fields * Superior colliculus * IPS / LIP ReferencesExternal links  *Amiez, C., & Petrides, M.

The company's portfolio includes the Chicago Tribune, the New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun, the Orlando Sentinel, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel, the Hartford Courant, additional titles in Pennsylvania and Virginia, syndication operations, and websites. It also publishes several local newspapers in its metropolitan regions, which are organized in subsidiary groups. It is the nation's third-largest newspaper publisher (behind Gannett and The McClatchy Company), with eleven daily newspapers and commuter tabloids throughout the United States. Incorporated in 1847 with the founding of the Chicago Tribune, Tribune Publishing operated as a division of the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based multimedia conglomerate, until it was spun off into a separate public company in August 2014. On June 20, 2016, Tribune Publishing adopted the name tronc, short for \\"Tribune online content\\". Its principal shareholder after the spin-off, with a 25.5% stake, was the American business magnate Michael W. Ferro, Jr. In 2016 The New York Times described him as being \\"one of the country’s most significant and unpredictable media moguls\\". He sold his stake to a hedge fund in 2019. In 2018, Tronc announced that it would sell its California papers, including the Los Angeles Times, San Diego Union-Tribune and other smaller titles in the California News Group to an investment firm headed by a major tronc shareholder, Patrick Soon-Shiong for US$500 million. The sale closed on June 18, 2018. In October 2018, the company reverted to its original name Tribune Publishing. In December 2019, Alden Global Capital, a New York City-based hedge fund, acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company. Accessed January 20, 2020. History=Early history Tribune Publishing's history dates back to 1847, when the Chicago Tribune (for which the company and its former parent, Tribune Media, are named) published its first edition on June 10 of that year, in a one-room plant at LaSalle and Lake Streets in Chicago. The Tribune constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869; however the building was destroyed, along with most of the city, by the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871. The Tribune resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring \\"Chicago Shall Rise Again\\". The newspaper's editor and part-owner, Joseph Medill, was elected mayor and led the city's reconstruction. A native Ohioan who first acquired an interest in the Tribune in 1855, Medill gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899. Medill's two grandsons, cousins Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, assumed leadership of the company in 1911. That same year, the Chicago Tribunes first newsprint mill opened in Thorold, Ontario, Canada. The mill marked the beginnings of the Canadian newsprint producer later known as QUNO, in which Tribune held an investment interest until 1995. The Chicago Tribune- New York News Syndicate was formed in 1918, leading to Joseph Patterson's establishment of the company's second newspaper, the New York Daily News on June 26, 1919. Tribune's ownership of the New York City tabloid was considered \\"interlocking\\" due to an agreement between McCormick and Patterson. Growth and acquisitions The company acquired the Fort Lauderdale-based Sun- Sentinel newspaper in 1963; this was later followed by its purchase of the Orlando Sentinel in 1965. In 1973, the company began sharing stories among 25 subscriber newspapers via the newly formed news service, the Knight News Wire. By 1990, this service was known as Knight-Ridder/Tribune and provided graphics, photo, and news content to its member newspapers. KRT became McClatchy-Tribune Information Services, which is owned by the Tribune Company and McClatchy, when The McClatchy Company purchased Knight-Ridder Inc. in 2006. Tribune later acquired the Newport News, Virginia-based Daily Press in 1986. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, the New York Daily News was sold to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991. In June 2000, Tribune acquired the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company in a merger deal worth $8.3 billion, which was the largest acquisition in the history of the newspaper industry. The merger added seven daily newspapers to Tribune's portfolio, including the Los Angeles Times, the Long Island-based Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, and the Hartford Courant. Tribune Media Net, the national advertising sales organization of Tribune Publishing, was established in 2000 to take advantage of the company's expanded scale and scope. Later in the decade, Tribune launched daily newspapers targeting urban commuters, including the Chicago Tribune RedEye edition in 2002, followed by an investment in AM New York one year later. In 2006, Tribune acquired the minority equity interest in AM New York, giving it full ownership of the newspaper. The company sold both Newsday and AM New York to Cablevision Systems Corporation in 2008, with the sale of the latter paper closing on July 29 of that year. Takeover by Sam Zell and bankruptcy On April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to buy out the Tribune Company for $34.00 a share, totaling $8.2 billion, with intentions to take the company private. The deal was approved by 97% of the company's shareholders on August 21, 2007. Privatization of the Tribune Company occurred on December 20, 2007, with Tribune's stock listing being terminated at the close of the trading day. On December 8, 2008, faced with a high debt load totaling $13 billion, related to the company's leveraged buyout and subsequent privatization, and a sharp downturn in newspaper advertising revenue, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in what was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry.Tribune files for bankruptcy Chicago Breaking News. Retrieved December 8, 2008. Company plans called for it to emerge from bankruptcy by May 31, 2010, but the company would end up in protracted bankruptcy proceedings for four years. On July 13, 2012, the Tribune Company received approval of a reorganization plan to allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co., which were the company's senior debt holders, assumed control of Tribune's properties upon the company's exit from bankruptcy on December 31, 2012. Spin-off of publishing unit On February 26, 2013, Tribune reportedly hired investment firms Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan & Co. to oversee the sale of its newspapers. On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced that it would split into two companies, spinning off its publishing division into the Tribune Publishing Company. Its broadcasting, digital media and other assets (including GraceNote) would remain with the Tribune Company. On November 20, 2013, Tribune announced it would cut 700 jobs from its newspaper properties due to declining advertising revenues. On June 17, 2014, in a presentation for lenders, Tribune revealed that it had set August 4 as the target date for its spin-off of Tribune Publishing. The split was finalized on the target date, with the publishing arm being spun out as Tribune Publishing Company, and its former parent company being renamed Tribune Media.  Post spin-off  Tribune Publishing acquired six suburban daily and 32 weekly newspapers in the Chicago Metropolitan Area in October 2014. These acquisitions were similar in strategy to earlier acquisitions in the state of Maryland, expanding its footprint in its eight \\"core markets.\\" On May 7, 2015, Tribune Publishing announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the San Diego Union-Tribune and its associated properties for $85 million, ending the paper's 146 years of private ownership. Following the completion of the acquisition, the Union- Tribune and the Los Angeles Times became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, led by current Times publisher and CEO Timothy E. Ryan. The two papers will retain distinct operations, but there will be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them. The acquisition did not include the paper's headquarters, which remains owned by the paper's previous owner, Doug Manchester. In April 2016, Gannett Company (which, much like Tribune, had spun out its broadcasting properties into a separate firm to focus on publishing assets) made an unsolicited bid to acquire Tribune Publishing for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). On May 17, 2016, Tribune chairman Michael Ferro stated that he intended to make a bid to acquire Gannett instead. On November 1, 2016, Gannett announced that it would no longer pursue its acquisition of Tronc. tronc era On June 2, 2016, the company announced that it would rebrand itself as tronc, short for \\"Tribune online content\\". The rebranding took place on June 20, 2016. Tronc began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol TRNC. That day, chief technology officer Malcolm CasSelle and chief digital officer Anne Vasquez announced to employees initiatives in content optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and increasing the amount of video to 50% of all content by 2017, in an effort to increase reader engagement and ad revenue. The company also introduced a new slogan, From Pixels to Pulitzers. The video announcement was derided in social and print media as full of buzzwords and lacking substance. On August 7, 2016, while criticising several aspects of a corporate restructuring that went along with the rebranding (for instance a shift of focus away from hard news towards usage maximization, which he perceived as undue), satirist John Oliver mocked this new name as \\"the sound an ejaculating elephant makes\\", and (ironically) \\"the sound of a stack of newspapers hitting a dumpster.\\" The Verge said, \\"Sounds like a Millennial falling down the stairs.\\" On March 13, 2017, tronc announced that it would license Arc, the content management system of The Washington Post. On September 4, 2017, tronc announced that it had acquired the New York Daily News. Having been established in 1919 by the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate, the Daily News had been owned by the Tribune Company before its sale to Robert Maxwell in 1991 and then to Mortimer Zuckerman in 1993. Tronc purchased the New York Daily News for $1 plus the assumption of its liabilities. On July 23, 2018, tronc announced massive layoffs at the paper, and ousted its editor in chief. On February 7, 2018, tronc announced that it will sell off its California properties (Los Angeles Times, San Diego Union-Tribune) to Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million, with the buyers assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The sale closed on June 18 that year.  Tribune Publishing  On June 19, 2018, it was reported that tronc would revert its name back to Tribune Publishing; this would be confirmed by the company in October of that year. In July 2018 tronc moved their headquarters from Tribune Tower several blocks south to One Prudential Plaza. In January 2019, Tribune announced that industry veteran Timothy P. Knight would succeed Justin Dearborn as CEO. Dearborn had served as CEO since 2016. The company's board of directors also elected former Congressman and chairman of the House Rules Committee David Dreier to succeed Dearborn as chairman. In December 2019, Alden Global Capital, a New York City-based hedge fund, acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company. In February 2020, Dreier and Knight stepped down as chairman and CEO, respectively. Knight was replaced by the chief financial officer, Terry Jimenez.

Buratino originated as a character in the commedia dell'arte. The name Buratino is derived from the Italian burattino, which means wooden puppet or doll.Dictionary Translation of Burattino The book was published in 1936, and Buratino quickly became hugely popular among children in the Soviet Union, and remains so to this day (Buratino is one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature). The story has been made into several films, including the animated 1959 film and the live action 1975 film. Origin According to Tolstoy, he had read Pinocchio as a child, but, having lost the book, he started re-imagining it many years later in an attempt to come up with a series of bedside stories for his own children. The resulting story turned out to be so original and became so loved by the writer's children, that he decided to put it to paper and publish it. Researchers, however, don't tend to find this explanation plausible, since the first Russian translation of Pinocchio didn't appear until Tolstoy was in his mid-twenties. Miron Petrovsky, in his article on the subject, states that the book was based upon a 1924 translation made by Nina Petrovskaya (1879-1928) and edited by Tolstoy, who had already removed many of the elements absent in The Golden Key.Что отпирает \\"Золотой ключик\\", Мирон Петровский Plot Like Pinocchio, Buratino is a long-nosed wooden puppet. According to the story, he is carved by Papa Carlo (the story's version of Geppetto) from a log, and suddenly comes to life. Upon creation, Buratino comes out long-nosed due to Papa Carlo's sloppy woodworking. Papa Carlo tries to shorten it, but Buratino resists. Papa Carlo then sells his only good jacket in order to buy textbooks for Buratino and sends him to school. However, the boy becomes distracted by an advertisement for a local puppet theater show, and sells his textbooks to buy a ticket to the show. There he befriends other puppets, but the evil puppetmaster Karabas Barabas (the story's Mangiafuoco character) wants to destroy him because Buratino disrupted the show. Karabas Barabas releases Buratino after he learns that Papa Carlo's home contains a secret door for which Karabas has been searching. A Golden Key that Karabas once possessed, but later lost, opens this secret door. Karabas releases Buratino and even gives him five gold coins, asking only that Buratino watch after his father's home and make sure they do not move. The story proceeds to tell of Buratino and his friends' hunt for the Golden Key, and their struggle against the evil Karabas, his loyal friend Duremar, as well as a couple of crooks: Alice the Fox and Basilio the Cat (based on The Fox and the Cat), who are after Buratino's coins. Many of Buratino's further adventures are, however, derived from Collodi's Pinocchio, but are reworked to fit into Tolstoy's story. Deviations from Collodi's story * The Fairy with Turquoise Hair is in Tolstoy's version another puppet from Karabas's theatre, named Malvina. She retains the blue colour of her hair, her poodle servant (called Artemon by Tolstoy) and her function of saving Buratino from the Fox and the Cat who hanged him on a tree. To explain her presence in the forest, it is stated that she had escaped from the theatre earlier. She is represented as somewhat overprotective and less likable than Collodi's Fairy, yet finally befriends Buratino. * The character of Pierrot is introduced. He is in love with Malvina. Pierrot is represented as an archetypal poet (his poems are actually cited). * Tolstoy omits most details which in the 20th century would be considered too gruesome or too moralistic, such as: Pinocchio having burned his feet; black rabbits pretending to be about to bury him; the whole Land of Toys subplot; the shark swallowing Pinocchio and his father etc. * Unlike Pinocchio in the original story, Buratino never shifts to right behaviour (however he is much kinder than Pinocchio) and does not become a real human. Quite the contrary, he is rewarded for not following the rules of what is assumed to be right behaviour (while he was never as cruel as Pinocchio) and being nonconformist. In the finale, we see him playing in a new puppet theatre of Carlo's. * Buratino's nose does not grow when he lies. Characters *Buratino is a wooden puppet with a long nose. * Papa Carlo () is a barrel organ player of little means, who created Buratino. * Giuseppe (Джузеппе), nicknamed \\"Giuseppe the Blue Nose\\" for always being drunk, is a woodworker and a friend of Carlo. He wanted to make a table leg from the talking log, but got scared and finally gave the log as a present to Papa Carlo. * Karabas Barabas (Карабас-Барабас) is an evil puppeteer. He owns a puppet theater with many marionettes, including Malvina, Pierrot, and Harlequin. * Malvina (Мальвина) is a beautiful female puppet with blue hair. * Artemon (Артемон) is Malvina's loyal poodle. * Pierrot (Пьеро) is a sad puppet and a poet who is deeply in love with Malvina. * Harlequin (Арлекин) is Pierrot's scene partner in Karabas's theatre. He usually mocks and beats Pierrot. * Alice the Fox (Лиса Алиса) and Basilio the Cat (Кот Базилио), two swindlers. * Tortila the Turtle (Черепаха Тортила) gives the Golden Key to Buratino, the same key that was lost by Karabas. * Duremar (Дуремар) is a partner of Karabas Barabas who catches leeches for a living and so disturbs Tortilla's pond.

Bush in December 2005 (as part of ), is a controversial tort liability shield intended to protect vaccine manufacturers from financial risk in the event of a declared public health emergency. The act specifically affords to drug makers immunity from potential financial liability for clinical trials of avian influenza vaccine at the discretion of the Executive branch of government. PREPA strengthens and consolidates the oversight of litigation against pharmaceutical companies under the purview of the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). PREPA provides $3.8 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness to protect public health in the case of a pandemic disease outbreak. Vaccine manufacturers lobbied for the legislation, which would effectively preempt state vaccine safety laws in the case of an emergency declaration by HHS, by making clear they would not produce new vaccines unless the legislation was enacted. Legislative process Legislative leaders Senator Bill Frist and Congressman Dennis Hastert were among the backers of PREPA legislation. Rep. Nathan Deal spoke on the House floor in support of the bill, calling it \\"absolutely critical legislation\\".\\"Conference Report on H.R. 2863, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006\\". Congressional Record. Vol. 151, No. 164. December 18, 2005. It was added to the final version of a Department of Defense- appropriations bill (H.R. 2863) while the bill was negotiated between the Senate and the House of Representatives.\\"H.R.2863 - Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006: Actions\\". United States Congress. December 30, 2005. On December 19, 2005, the appropriations bill with the PREPA legislation was approved by the House of Representatives in a vote of 308–106, with 2 voting Present and 18 not voting. On December 22, it was approved by the Senate in a vote of 93–0. On December 22, it was approved by the Senate in a vote of 93–0, with 7 not voting. President Bush signed the bill into law on December 30. Funding Of the $3.8 billion earmarked for pandemic preparedness, $350 million is slated for improvement of state and local preparedness. HHS will use most of the balance on \\"core preparedness activities\\", such as developing vaccines and stockpiling antiviral drugs. Under PREPA, an HHS emergency declaration will trigger establishment of a fund for \\"timely, uniform, and adequate compensation\\" program for vaccine injuries, but no funding provisions for such purposes were included in its language. Liability protection and consolidation of oversight PREPA was designed specifically to encourage rapid production of vaccines to protect American citizens in case of a potential public health threat. However, the primary effects of the legislation hinge on liability protections for drug companies, under provisions intended to remove financial risk barriers for any new vaccines that need to be rushed to market in case of an emergency. Under PREPA, the HHS secretary will have primary responsibility for making decisions on whether or not to declare an emergency that would justify removing financial risk barriers, which otherwise would cause a prudent manufacturer to exercise caution. Pursuant to such an emergency declaration, liability protection would extend to doctors and other individuals and organizations involved with countermeasures, which may include any medical product to prevent, treat, mitigate, or diagnose an epidemic. The act does not list any criteria for determining the existence of an emergency, but it does specify that any such declaration would have to list the diseases, populations, and geographic areas covered and when the emergency would end.\\"Pandemic Funding, Liability Shield Clear Congress\\". Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. University of Minnesota. December 28, 2005. PREPA removes the right to a jury trial for persons injured by a covered vaccine, unless a plaintiff can provide clear evidence of willful misconduct that resulted in death or serious physical injury. The act instructs the HHS secretary to write regulations \\"that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered person\\" that constitute willful misconduct. In the event of an emergency declared by HHS, Federal law would preempt all state provisions related to pandemic emergency preparedness, and would supersede any state provision governing vaccines. PREPA applies to any drug, vaccine, or biological product that the HHS secretary deems a \\"covered countermeasure,\\" or that the secretary decides is a public health situation that could become an emergency at some point in the future, whether or not there is a specific relationship to a dangerous pandemic or bioterrorism. By invoking provisions of PREPA, the HHS secretary can wield broad authority to declare an emergency, which in turn would trigger drug company immunity from liability at any time, thereby conferring upon drug companies legal immunity for harm caused by their misconduct. The immunity that could be conferred on drug and vaccine manufacturers can be applied regardless of wrongdoing by affected drug companies. Opposition Numerous consumer organizations vigorously opposed the legislation, including A-CHAMP, Eagle Forum, and Public Citizen, as well as first responder organizations representing nurses, firemen and veterans. A-CHAMP ran a series of full page advertisements in various publications in opposition to PREPA. Because the legislation delegates broad legislative power to the executive branch of government, opponents view it as a violation of fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution. Senator Edward Kennedy issued a statement demanding repeal of the PREPA legislation, while condemning the liability provisions as a giveaway to the drug industry.Kennedy, Edward (2005). \\"Statement\\". United States Senate. Kennedy said the bill makes it \\"essentially impossible\\" for injured parties to sue for damages, and that the measure allows common diseases to be used as a reason to activate the liability shield. Kennedy also notes that one of the drug companies that lobbied for PREPA is Sanofi Pasteur, which is under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigation for being connected to at least five cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome caused by its meningococcal vaccine. When the PREPA legislation was presented, its broad liability shields, its potential for undermining state vaccine laws, and its consolidation of responsibility within the executive branch were misrepresented in Congress and media, according to critics, who note that it was portrayed instead as primarily concerned with preparations to combat the avian flu. Opponents also contend that PREPA may contribute to the potential for abuse of discretion by the current George W. Bush Administration, which is generally perceived as friendly to the drug industry. In particular, critics are concerned about the possibility that state laws banning thimerosal containing vaccines (TCVs) may be preempted. If the HHS secretary designates that a vaccine is a covered countermeasure, thimerosal (a mercury containing preservative) can be used in the vaccine, even in states that have enacted such bans.

On Broadway, Lee Tracy played the dancer, Thomas Jackson played the detective and Paul Porcasi played the night club owner. In the 1929 film, Jackson and Porcasi reprised their roles and Glenn Tryon replaced Tracy. Pat O'Brien once played the detective role in a road show. Universal had paid $175,000 for the rights. In February 1941 Universal announced the film would be part of its slate for the coming year. Bruce Manning, a writer who had recently been promoted to producer, would produce and George Raft and Broderick Crawford would star, from a script by Manning and Felix Young. However Raft was under contract to Warner Bros who refused to loan him out. Raft kept refusing roles at Warners who put him under suspension for months. Eventually Warners relented and Raft made the film.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 100 Raft said he had to pay $27,500 out of his own pocket and negotiate so that Warners could borrow Robert Cummings from Universal free of charge. In December 1941 Raft signed to make the film. Producer Bruce Manning wanted to turn the bootleggers into foreign agents. He discussed the story with George Raft and recognised the similarities the story of Roy, the dancer played on stage with Lee Tracey, had with the early career of George Raft. He decided to keep the characters as bootleggers but changed the story to make it about George Raft. He also added a prologue and epilogue where Raft returns to New York after establishing himself as a movie star. In February 1942 O'Brien signed to co star. Filming started that month. Reception The film was a success with audiences. The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"sock melodrama\\". Filmink magazine said the film \\"isn’t particularly well remembered but it's a lot of fun, with plenty of gunfire and dancing, and was reasonably popular – Raft was best known for his gangster movies, but he was also a half-decent draw in musicals.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Review of film at Variety Category:1940s musical drama films Category:1942 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American mystery drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films about musical theatre Category:Films about theatre Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by William A.

Bava co-wrote the screenplay with Giuseppe Zaccariello, Filippo Ottoni, and Sergio Canevari, with story credit given to Dardano Sacchetti and Franco Barberi. The film stars Claudine Auger, Luigi Pistilli and Laura Betti. Carlo Rambaldi created the gruesome special make-up effects. The story details a string of mysterious murders that occur around the titular bay. Widely considered Bava's most violent film, its emphasis on graphically bloody murder set pieces was hugely influential on the slasher film subgenre that would follow a decade later. In 2005, the magazine Total Film named A Bay of Blood one of the 50 greatest horror films of all time.  Plot  At night in her bayside mansion, wheelchair-bound Countess Federica Donati is attacked and strangled to death by her husband Filippo Donati. Moments later, Filippo himself is stabbed to death by an assailant, and his corpse is then dragged to the bay. Upon investigation, the police find what they believe to be a suicide note written by the Countess, but Filippo's murder goes undiscovered. Real estate agent Frank Ventura and his lover Laura are plotting to take possession of the bay. After the Countess refused to sell her home and property to them, the couple hatched a scheme with Donati to murder his wife. To finalize their plan, Ventura needs Donati's signature on a set of legal documents. They have no idea, however, that Filippo himself has been killed. Their curiosity piqued by news of the murder, four local teenagers break into the seemingly deserted mansion and are murdered. The Countess's illegitimate son Simon, who lives on the grounds in a separate shack, is the killer. After killing Filippo, he is now conspiring with Ventura, who offers Simon a large cash pay-off in exchange for signing the relevant legal documents. Their scheme is dealt a potentially ruinous blow when Filippo's estranged daughter Renata appears, determined to ensure that her father's estate comes into her possession. A search for a will proves unsuccessful, and Ventura, who believes that Renata may be the rightful beneficiary, urges Simon to kill his stepsister. Accompanied by her husband Albert, and leaving their young son and daughter in a caravan nearby, Renata visits the house of Paolo Fassati, an entomologist who lives on the grounds of the Donati estate. Fossati's wife Anna tells them that Filippo was responsible for the Countess's death, and says that Simon will probably end up with the property. Renata, who had no idea she had a stepbrother, makes plans with her husband to murder Simon. After discovering Filippo's mangled and rotting corpse on Simon's boat, Renata and Albert head to Ventura's house. Upon their arrival, Ventura attacks Renata, but Renata gains the upper hand and stabs Ventura with a butterfly knife in his femoral artery. Paolo Fassati, who witnesses the assault, attempts to telephone the police but is confronted by Albert, who strangles him to death. To ensure there are no additional witnesses, Renata decapitates Anna with an axe. Ventura's partner Laura arrives, planning to meet up with him. When Simon discovers that it was the pair who had plotted with Filippo to kill his mother, he strangles Laura to death. No sooner has he exacted his revenge than Simon himself is murdered by Albert. The wounded Ventura reappears, but Albert kills him after a brief struggle. Secure in the knowledge that there are now no other living heirs, Albert and Renata prepare to return home to await the announcement of their inheritance, when they are shot dead from the caravan by their son, who has mistaken their shotgun for a toy. Thinking that their parents are playing dead, the son and daughter rush off outside to play along the bay.

He contacted Sacchetti and persuaded him to collaborate with director Mario Bava on a giallo film. Sacchetti and Bava got along well, and together came up with a story in which two parents commit murder to secure a better future for their children. In this early version of the story, the parents are driven to commit one murder after another in a chain reaction, becoming so caught up in their plan that they abandon their children for several days. When they return home, the starving and terrified children kill them. The thirteen murders were conceived as isolated sequences, with no initial idea of how they would fit into the story; Sacchetti credits Bava with the idea of two people being killed with a spear while making love and himself with the idea of a woman being killed in her wheelchair. Sacchetti wrote the first draft of the script, titled Cosi imparano a fare i cattivi (\\"That Will Teach Them to Be Bad\\") after a line spoken by the children after killing their parents, with his writing partner Franco Barbieri. However, spectacular arguments with Bava and the production team led to Barbieri being fired, and Sacchetti quit as an act of solidarity with his partner. De Laurentiis, disenchanted when The Cat o' Nine Tails failed to recreate its domestic popularity when released abroad, also abandoned the project. Bava, owing a massive amount in back taxes, felt he needed to complete a film soon, and turned to Giuseppe Zaccariello (who had silently backed Bava's earlier films Hatchet for the Honeymoon and Five Dolls for an August Moon) to take over as producer. Zaccariello insisted that the shooting script be written by Filippo Ottoni, who was reluctant to take the job since he did not like exploitation films. Numerous other writers, including Zaccariello himself, had their hands involved in devising the final screenplay.Lucas, Tim. Twitch of the Death Nerve DVD, Image Entertainment, 2000, liner notes. ASIN: B000055ZCA The cast included Laura Betti, who had got along well with Bava on Hatchet for the Honeymoon. At the time De Laurentiis approached Bava about working with Sacchetti, Bava and Betti had been toying with the idea of making a movie called \\"Odore di carne\\" (\\"stench of flesh\\") about cannibalism on Los Angeles colleges. The film began production in early 1971, still under the shooting title Cosi imparano a fare i cattivi, which was soon changed to Reazione a catena (\\"chain reaction\\").Stevens, Brad. Video Watchdog Magazine, #32 (1996), pgs. 10-11, \\"A Bay of Blood\\" videotape review Yet another title used during shooting was La baia d'argento (\\"the bay of silver\\"), discarded for fear that the movie would be perceived as a parody of Dario Argento's works as a result. The final title of Ecologia del delitto was suggested by Zaccariello because the word \\"ecologia\\" was in vogue at the time. The movie's budget was extremely low, and it had to be shot very quickly and cheaply. Due to the severe budgetary restrictions, Bava not only acted as his own cinematographer, but also utilized a simple child's wagon for the film's many tracking shots. The location shooting was mostly completed at Zaccariello's Sabaudia beach house and its outlying property. Bava had to resort to various camera tricks to convince the audience that an entire forest existed when in fact, only a few scattered trees were at the location. Betti recalled, \\"All of this had to occur in a forest. But where was it? Bava said, 'Don't worry. I will do the forest.' And he found a florist who was selling these little stupid branches with little bits of foliage on them, and he began to make them dance in front of the camera! We had to act the scenes strictly in front of those branches—if we moved even an inch either way, the 'woods' would disappear!\\" To ensure the utmost realism in depicting the thirteen different murders, Carlo Rambaldi was hired to provide the special make-up effects. To create the deaths of Anna, Brunhilda, and Denise, wax effigies of the actresses' throats and backs were constructed and rigged to expulse brightly colored blood when cut. The illusion of Bobby being stabbed in the face with a billhook was achieved with a prop blade which was swiftly pulled out of frame to hide the fact that it was sculpted to conform exactly to actor Roberto Bonanni's profile.  Release  In Italy, the film was announced as Antefatto (\\"Before the Fact\\"), but when finally released to theatres, the title had changed to Ecologia del delitto (\\"Ecology of Crime\\"). When the film did poorly on its initial release, it was pulled from Italian theaters and retitled Reazione a Catena (\\"Chain Reaction\\"), and was later re-released as Bahia de Sangre (\\"Bay of Blood\\" in Spanish). A Bay of Blood was acquired up for US distribution in 1972 by Steve Minasian's Hallmark Releasing, which specialized in exploitation films. Premiering the film under its original English title, Carnage, Hallmark copied their successful advertising campaign for Mark of the Devil by proclaiming that Bava's film was \\"The Second Film Rated 'V' for Violence!\\" (Devil having been the first). This campaign prompted a lawsuit from the Motion Picture Association of America on the grounds that it intruded on their exclusive right to rate motion pictures, and the film was withdrawn and re-released under the now common title Twitch of the Death Nerve with a R rating appearing in advertisements. Thanks to Hallmark's distribution partnership with Bava's former employer American International Pictures, the film played for years under this title in drive-ins and grindhouses throughout the country as part of a double or triple bill with other Hallmark/AIP films, most notably Wes Craven's equally-influential The Last House on the Left and Fernando Di Leo's Slaughter Hotel, but it has since been re-released theatrically and on home video under a variety of titles. In the US alone, its later titles include A Bay of Blood, Last House on the Left Part II, Last House Part II and New House on the Left. Critical response A Bay of Blood was greeted with disappointment and disgust by several critics, especially by those who were fans of the director's earlier, more restrained films. At the 1971 Avoriaz Film Festival, where the movie had its world premiere, Christopher Lee attended a screening of the film, having expressed an interest in seeing the latest effort from the director of The Whip and the Body, which Lee had starred in eight years before. Lee was reportedly completely revolted by the movie. The festival jurors awarded the film the Best Make-Up and Special Effects Award. Rambaldi's effects work also earned the film a \\"Special Mention\\" Award at the prestigious Sitges Film Festival in 1971.Normanton, Peter. \\"A Bay of Blood.\\" The Mammoth Book of Slasher Movies. Running Press. Philadelphia, PA. 2012. It remains Bava’s most controversial film and maintains a mixed critical reception. Jeffrey Frentzen, reviewing the film for Cinefantastique, called Twitch of the Death Nerve \\"the director's most complete failure to date. If you were appalled by the gore and slaughter in Blood and Black Lace, this latest film contains twice the murders, each one accomplished with an obnoxious detail... Red herrings are ever-present, and serve as the only interest keeping the plot in motion, but nothing really redeems the dumb storyline.\\"Frentzen, Jeffrey. Twitch of the Death Nerve Review, Cinefantastique, Volume 4 Number 3, 1974, pg. 36 Gary Johnson, on his Images website, said that \\"Twitch of the Death Nerve is made for people who derive pleasure from seeing other people killed...The resulting movie is guaranteed to make audiences squirm, but the violence is near pornographic. In the same way that pornographic movies reduce human interactions to the workings of genitals, Twitch of the Death Nerve reduces cinematic thrills to little more than knives slicing through flesh.\\" Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, while noting that Bava was able to \\"achieve some striking images\\", opined \\"Zooms, no doubt programmed by the imperative to work quickly, spoil some scenes that cried out for Bava's particularly fluid use of camera movement which were so much in evidence in Operazione Paura (1966).\\"Hardy, Phil (editor). The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Aurum Press, 1986. Reprinted as The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Overlook Press, 1995, On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, A Bay of Blood holds an 85% approval rating based on 13 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.07/10. Joe Dante, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about the film, writing in The Film Bulletin (later reprinted in Video Watchdog) that it \\"features enough violence and gore to satisfy the most rabid mayhem fans and benefits from the inimitably stylish direction of horror specialist Mario Bava (Black Sunday). Assembled with a striking visual assurance that never ceases to amuse, this is typical Bava material, simply one ghastly murder after another---13 in all---surrounded by what must be one of the most preposterous and confusing plots ever put on film.\\"Dante, Joe. Video Watchdog Magazine, #95, pgs. 24-25, \\"Joe Dante's Fleapit Flashbacks\\", review of Twitch of the Death Nerve. In Fangoria, Tim Lucas wrote thirteen years after the film's theatrical release that \\"Twitch unreels like a macabre, ironic joke, a movie built like an inescapable trap for its own anti-hero...Seen today, the violence in this movie remains as potent and explicit as anything glimpsed in contemporary \\"splatter\\" features...\\"Lucas, Tim. Fangoria Magazine, #43, pg. 31, \\"Bava's Terrors, Part 2\\", article on Bava's career.  Legacy  Several critics have noted that the film is probably the most influential of Bava's career, as it had a huge and profound impact on the slasher film genre. Writing in 2000, Tim Lucas wrote that Bava's film is \\"the acknowledged smoking gun behind the 'body count' movie phenomenon of the 1980s, which continues to dominate the horror genre two decades later with such films as Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and their respective sequels.\\" According to Gary Johnson, \\"Twitch of the Death Nerve is one of the most imitated movies of the past 30 years. It helped kick start the slasher genre… [Bava’s] influence still resonates today (although somewhat dully) in movies such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream and Urban Legend.\\" It was listed at #94 in IndieWire's The 100 Greatest Horror Movies of All-Time, with its entry stating that the film, \\"remains a vital watch for horror fans, and a reminder of how Bava continued to push horror into new and interesting realms, the reverberations of which are still felt today.\\" Several commentators have noted that two sequences in the 1981 film Friday the 13th Part 2 are strikingly similar to two of Bava's murder sequences: one character is slammed in the face with a hawkbill machete, though Bava's film had a billhook instead, and two teenage lovers are interrupted when a spear impales both of them. Along with The Burning, Just Before Dawn (1981) and several other similarly-plotted slashers, Friday specifically \\"followed Bava's inspired cue, having young people stalked by violent death amid beautiful wooded settings.\\" Notes References  External links   * Category:1971 films Category:1971 horror films Category:1970s slasher films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Mario Bava Category:Films scored by Stelvio Cipriani Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Giallo films Category:Italian films Category:Italian horror films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian slasher films Category:Italian serial killer films Category:American International Pictures films ","title":"A Bay of Blood"},{"id":"4136538","text":"Myrna Veenstra (born 4 March 1975 in Goes) is a former field hockey player from the Netherlands, who played 79 international matches for the Netherlands, in which the defender scored one goal.

Curiosity rover will traverse on its way to Mount Sharp (November 13, 2013). Bruce Churchill Murray (November 30, 1931 – August 29, 2013) was an American planetary scientist. He was a director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and co-founder of The Planetary Society. Education and early life Murray received his Ph.D. in geology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1955 and joined Standard Oil of California as a geologist. He served in the United States Air Force as a geophysicist, and the U.S. Civil Service before joining California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1960. Main career At Caltech, Murray became an associate professor in 1963, a full professor in 1969, and a professor emeritus in 2001. He would later become professor emeritus of planetary science and geology. Murray began working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory(managed by/affiliated with Caltech) in 1960, and served as its director from April 1, 1976 to June 30, 1982. He was an important force in promoting the recruitment and hiring of female engineers at the lab, where more women are employed today than any other NASA facility. Murray became JPL's director at a time when space exploration budgets were shrinking; among other achievements, he saved the Galileo mission to Jupiter from the budget axe. Murray worked out the geologic history of Mars using photographs taken by Mariner 4 in 1965; he worked with Bob Leighton to accomplish this task. He applied similar photographic analysis when he served as chief scientist of Mariner 10. As he took over management of JPL, he expressed reservations about the Viking lander program, pointing out that the biological experiments included with the spacecraft were not sufficient to accomplish their stated goals. With Carl Sagan and Louis Friedman, Murray founded The Planetary Society. He also served a term as its chair. Personal life and death Murray was twice married. With his first wife, Joan O'Brien, he had three children. Murray and O'Brien divorced in 1970. In 1971, Murray married Suzanne Murray, with whom he had two children. One of Murray's cousins is former Speaker of the House Tom Foley. Murray died at his home in Oceanside, California on August 29, 2013, from complications of Alzheimer's disease, aged 81. Awards and honors Murray was the recipient of the 1997 Carl Sagan Memorial Award. In 2004, Murray was awarded the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in Telluride, Colorado. Asteroid 4957 Brucemurray is named after him, and the asteroid 2392 Jonathan Murray is named after his son. On November 13, 2013, NASA announced the names of two features on Mars important to two active Mars exploration rovers in honor of Murray: \\"Murray Ridge\\", an uplifted crater that the Opportunity rover is exploring; and \\"Murray Buttes\\", an entryway the Curiosity rover will traverse on its way to Mount Sharp.

The college is named after Meg Whitman, former CEO of eBay, following her $30 million donation to build the college. The structure was designed by the architect Demetri Porphyrios, winner of the 2004 Driehaus Prize. Construction of Whitman College was completed in Fall of 2007; 2007–08 marked the inaugural academic year for the college. Whitman is a four-year residential college, open to students of all four academic classes. Its sister two-year college is Forbes College. Although it is possible for any upperclassman to live in Whitman, priority for housing room draw is given to those upperclassmen who lived in either Whitman or Forbes as underclassmen. The current head of Whitman is Claire Gmachl; she is the Eugene Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University. The master of Whitman was Harvey S. Rosen, the John L. Weinberg Professor of Economics and Business Policy. The Dean is Dr. Rebecca Graves-Bayazitoglu, the former Director of Studies for Rockefeller College. The Director of Studies is Dr. Justin Lorts and the Director of Student Life is Momo Wolapaye.

He was a mainstay in a line that included Hall of Famers Jim Langer, Larry Little, and Dwight Stephenson and played in six Pro Bowls in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was selected as one of the top 15 finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame from 2002–2006, and one of the top 17 finalists from 2007–2009, but missed the cut every year. He was inducted into the Miami Dolphin's Honor Roll on December 15, 1995. He was the brother of the retired Chicago Bears linebacker Rudy Kuechenberg. College career Kuechenberg attended college at the University of Notre Dame, where he played both the offensive and defensive lines. Before college Kuechenberg attended Hobart High School, located in Hobart, Indiana 10 minutes from Gary, and 30 minutes from Chicago. Kuechenberg played football for the Hobart Brickies in his high school years. Professional career Kuechenberg was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles as a fourth-round pick in the 1969 NFL Draft. He quit shortly after training camp started and played a season of with the Chicago Owls in the Continental Football League. Kuechenberg signed with the Dolphins as a free agent in 1970. He became a starter that season as the Dolphins finished 10–4 and made the playoffs for the first time in club history. During the next regular season, 1971, Kuechenberg helped the Dolphins make it to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 24–3. In that game Kuechenberg's opponent was Hall of Famer Bob Lilly. The next two seasons the Dolphins won the Super Bowl (going 17–0 in 1972) and his play was noticed by New York Post writer Paul Zimmerman, who named Kuechenberg on his All-pro ballot. The following season, 1974, he was named All-AFC by Pro Football Weekly and was named to his first Pro Bowl. He was named 1st team All-Pro in 1975 and in 1978 and was named All-AFC three times. He was Second-team All-Pro in 1977. Kuechenberg was sometimes critical of his past teams. One such critique prompted then-current Miami All-Pro, Jason Taylor, to comment, \\"It's another chapter in the grumpy Kuechenberg story. It's Kuechenberg. He gets up every year and complains about something. If it ain't one thing, it's another. He needs a hug and a hobby.

One of her directors at the time was the well- known dancer, Tamalyn Dallal. Gamal went on to become the first dancer to audition with bellydancing techniques and be accepted at the New World School of the Arts' Performing Arts School. She trained in other types of dancing, such as ballet, jazz, tap, flamenco and modern, while at that school. Gamal subsequently went on to dance for five different dance companies. Gamal graduated with a degree in psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts. Her career expanded after that, as Gamal was given an opportunity to perform during the NFL's Super Bowl XXIX in 1995, and she earned the Miss World of Bellydancing contest in 1996. In 1997, Gamal had the opportunity of performing during the Gianni Versace fashion show. In 1998, she participated at the Oriental Dance Production, in Lexington, Kentucky.

It became the norm in very formal dining in the Western world over the 19th century. It contrasts with the older (; \\"service in the French style\\") in which all the food (or at least several courses) is brought out simultaneously, in an impressive display of tureens and serving dishes, and the diners put it on their plates themselves.Strong, 296–98Flanders, 236–38 It had the advantage of the food being much hotter when reaching the diner, and reducing the number of dishes and condiments on the table at a given time. It ensured that everybody could taste everything they wanted, which in practice the old system often did not allow. On the other hand, the effect of magnificent profusion was reduced, and many more footmen and more tableware were required, making it an option only the wealthy could afford. It also reduced the time spent at the table.Strong, 295–99 The Russian Ambassador Alexander Kurakin is credited with bringing to France in 1810, at a meal in Clichy on the outskirts of Paris.Strong, 296–97 It eventually caught on in England, becoming the norm by the 1870s and 1880s, though in France there was considerable resistance and lingered on until the 1890s, and even beyond for the most formal state banquets.Strong, 298–99 (both countries)Flanders, 236–38 (England) is now the style in which most modern Western restaurants serve food (with some significant modifications). There was a less formal style known as (; \\"English service\\") in France, with the hostess serving the soup at one end of the table, and later the host carving a joint of meat at the other end, servants taking these to the diners, and the diners serving themselves with other dishes.Strong, 296 Place setting and service order Service à la russe 8 course place setting for one person For the most correct service à la russe, in its modern form (significantly different from the original) the following must be observed: The place setting (called a cover) for each guest includes a service plate, all the necessary cutlery except those required for dessert, and stemmed glasses for water, wines and champagne. Atop the service plate is a rolled napkin, and atop that is the place card. Above the plate is a saltcellar, nut dish, and a menu. The cutlery to the right of the service plate is, from the outside in, the oyster fork resting in the bowl of the soup spoon, the fish knife, the meat knife and the salad knife (or fruit knife). On the left, from the outside in, are the fish fork, the meat fork and a salad fork (or fruit fork). If both a salad and a fruit course are served, the necessary extra flatware is brought out on a platter, as it is bad form to have more than three knives or forks on the table at once, the oyster fork excepted. Guests are seated according to their place cards and immediately remove their napkins and place them in their laps. Another view maintains that the napkin is only removed after the host has removed his or hers. (In the same manner, the host is first to begin eating, and guests follow.) The oyster plate is placed atop the service plate. Once that is cleared, the soup plate replaces it. After the soup course is finished, both the soup plate and service plate are removed from the table, and a heated plate is put in their place. The rule is as such: a filled plate is always replaced with an empty one, and no place goes without a plate until just before the dessert course. The fish and meat courses are now always served from platters because in correct service a filled plate is never placed before a guest, as this would indirectly dictate how much food the guest is to eat. This was not the case historically, nor is it often followed in restaurants. Directly before dessert, everything is removed from the place settings except the wine and water glasses. Crumbs are cleared. The dessert plate is then brought out with a doily on top of it, a finger bowl on top of that, and a fork and spoon, the former balanced on the left side of the plate and the latter on the right. Guests remove the doily and finger bowls, move them to the left of the plate and place the fork to the left side of the plate and the spoon to its right. Guests do not actually need to use the finger bowl, since they may have not used their fingers to eat with, unless they also had bread with the meal. A multi-course dinner served à la russe The number of dishes (or courses) served at a meal à la russe has changed over time; but an underlying pattern of service—beginning with soup, then moving through various entrées, then to the roast or game, and then to vegetables (including salads), sweets and coffee—persisted from the mid-19th century (when this type of service was introduced to France) until WWII, and continued in a much-reduced form into the 21st century. The order of dishes descends directly from the much older service à la française. In that style of service, all sorts of dishes were arranged on the table and guests served themselves and each other. As Jean-Louis Flandrin has shown, the order of consumption—known to the guests of the time but rarely evident from contemporary menus or descriptions of meals—was essentially the same as the order of presentation in service à la russe. The most elaborate version of service à la russe, which reached its pinnacle in the last decades of the Victorian era, was described by Sarah Tyson Rorer in 1886. Rorer was critical of this elaborate service and offered a much simpler alternative, which in fact represents the core principles of this style of service. > The elaborate and conventional dinner, complete at all points, which the > dinner-giving of a century and a half has evolved, is beyond any but the > very wealthy. Very few of them succeed in giving it, and still fewer of > their guests enjoy it. Its triple triplets of oysters, soup, and fish, the > relevé, entrées, and roast, a pause of rum punch to stimulate languishing > digestion, game with salad, sweets and ice, coffee to close, and a > bewildering series of wines, with an alcoholic appetizer to begin and end, > have, however, had their effect in making many feel that a formal dinner > must only follow this model from afar. So, with only the resources of a > simple household, they compass, with infinite labor, oysters, soup, and > fish, add some made dish to the meat, and put salad before and ice cream > after the pudding or sweets. > > But success here, with a moderate income, is as rare as success with the > long dinner at the complete table. Try to grasp the theory of the elaborate > edifice which custom and convention has piled up, and see if your own > resources cannot reproduce its purpose with better success. After having > carefully analyzed it, you will see at once that the most complex dinner > simply aims to begin with something of easy digestion, slide by some > transition to the roast, and make sure that through salad, sweets and > coffee, the last half of your dinner shall interest the appetite as well as > satisfy hunger. You, have, therefore, soup, roast, dessert, which make up > the usual dinner of thoroughly civilized people, and below you will see how, > with but moderate resources, you may so vary this as to make a “little > dinner” complete and satisfying in itself; more, the most elaborate meal at > Delmonico’s cannot do. In Britain and the United States, fish is a distinct course; relevés are large, solid joints of meat or whole fowl, generally baked, braised, or boiled but not roasted; entrées are elaborate \\"made dishes\\" of, typically, fillets of beef or other butcher's meat (and sometimes fowl, but—apart from days of religious observance—not fish), served in fine sauces. Roasts are solid joints of meat (and sometimes fowl) other than feathered game, usually spit-roasted but often baked. Game is feathered not furred, spit-roasted whole and served rather simply. (Rorer's \\"roast\\" here refers to a roasted entrée, but this terminology is not typical of the period. In her time, the \\"roast\\" followed the punch, and it was always game, if available.) At the time Rorer was writing, Alessandro Filippini, a chef at Delmonico's restaurant on Pine Street in New York, wrote a book of menus for \\"every family of means in the habit of giving a few dinners to its friends during the year\\", with a brief discussion of table service and a guide to wines. He recommended the types of menus criticized by Rorer but common among the wealthy. > French dinners are generally served in three main courses, viz., Relevés, > Entrées, and Rotis; all the rest are considered side courses. It depends > entirely on the taste of the host as to how many main courses he desires > served. The author would suggest two relevés, three entrées, and one or two > rotis; this could be made an elaborate dinner. About a third of Filippini's book contains menus for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner for every day of the year. The dinner menus begin with the \\"side courses\\", as he calls them: oysters or clams, soup, and hors d'œuvre; followed by the three \\"main courses\\": several relevés and entrées, and one roti (roast); and finally a few other \\"side courses\\": sweet entremets, ices, and coffee. Hors-d'œuvre are usually small cold items (such as olives, celery, radishes, charcuterie, caviar), but they might also include hot made dishes (such as timbales, croustades, croquettes). In the French style of service à la russe, used by Filippini for many of his menus, there is no distinct \\"fish course\\", as both relevés and entrées may be of meat, fowl, or fish indiscriminately. Punch often precedes the roast. The roast can be meat, fowl, or fish (though fish is generally limited to days of religious observance); when game is served, it always comprises the roast course. Entremets are the vegetables, including salads, served with the relevés and entrées; they not as a separate course, though they are often listed as such. Sweet entremets are cakes, puddings, and such. Ices are frozen sweets, served as a separate course. Fruit, petits fours, coffee, and cordials are offered at the end of the meal. A few years after Filippini wrote his book, Charles Ranhofer, another chef at Delmonico's restaurant (variously at the 14th Street, 26th Street, and 44th Street locations), in his cookbook The Epicurean, outlined in great detail the dishes necessary for dinners ranging from six to fourteen courses. The six-course dinner is very much like Rorer's \\"little dinner\\": oysters, soup, fish, entrée, roast, salad, and dessert. Longer dinners are arranged by adding side dishes, removes, and various cold dishes, and by serving a greater number of entrées and desserts. The longest of these menus is as follows: > Figure 1—36 covers: > # Oysters. > # 2 Soups. > # S.D. hot and cold. > # 2 Fish, potatoes. > # 1 Remove, vegetables. > # 1 Entrée, vegetables. > # 1 Entrée, vegetables. > # 1 Entrée, vegetables. > # 1 Punch. > # 1 or 2 Roasts. > # 1 or 2 Colds, salad. > # 1 Hot sweet dessert. > # 1 or 2 Cold sweet des'rts. > # 1 or 2 Ices. Dessert. \\"S.D.\\" are \\"side dishes\\", i.e. hors d'œuvre. There is a separate fish course, then relevés and entrées. Cold dishes, such as mayonnaise salads and aspics, had become very popular at this time, as is evident in the menu. Roasts could be of butchers' meat, fowl, or game (rarely, if ever, fish). When more than one dish was appointed for a course (e.g. 2 Soups, 2 Fish, 2 roasts, 2 colds), the guest was expected to choose one or the other, not both. A guest might decline one or more of the courses. Ranhofer also gives elaborate instructions for the service of wine. > FIRST SERVICE.

Several decades later, shorter meals had become the norm and the extravagant dinners of the Victorian period were considered vulgar, as noted by Emily Post in 1922: > Under no circumstances would a private dinner, no matter how formal, consist > of more than: > # Hors-d’œuvre > # Soup > # Fish > # Entrée > # Roast > # Salad > # Dessert > # Coffee > The menu for an informal dinner would leave out the entrée, and possibly > either the hors-d’oeuvre or the soup. As a matter of fact, the marked > shortening of the menu is in informal dinners and at the home table of the > well-to-do. Formal dinners have been as short as the above schedule for > twenty-five years. [c.1900.] A dinner interlarded with a row of extra > entrées, Roman punch, and hot dessert is unknown except at a public dinner, > or in the dining-room of a parvenu. About thirty-five years ago [c.1890] > such dinners are said to have been in fashion! At the time Post was writing, hors-d’œuvre meant rather narrowly light cold dishes like oysters, clams, melon, or citrus. Entrées meant elaborate \\"made dishes\\" of fillets of beef or other butcher's meat served in a fine sauce, or some sort of pastry dish. Roasts could be of any meat, which was not necessarily roasted. The preferred dish of a truly fine dinner was wild feathered game, spit-roasted and served rather simply. Dessert was molded ice cream only, to the exclusion of all other sweets. Despite Post's complaints about extra entrées, many dinners continued to feature two meat courses between the fish and the roast. Post's first book was published during Prohibition, and she noted, \\"A water glass standing alone at each place makes such a meager and untrimmed looking table that most people put on at least two wine glasses, sherry and champagne, or claret and sherry, and pour something pinkish or yellowish into them. [...] Those few who still have cellars, serve wines exactly as they used to, white wine, claret, sherry and Burgundy warm, champagne ice cold; and after dinner, green mint poured over crushed ice in little glasses, and other liqueurs of room temperature.\\" After World War II, dinners were curtailed even more. As Post writes in the 1950 edition of her book, the shorter \\"informal\\" meal of her earlier book had become the norm for formal dinners: > It is rare for a modern dinner to consist of more than five courses. > However, 'tasting menus' - whereby diners are served numerous courses do > exist. These are the exception though, and a formal dinner today would > typically include:: > # Soup or oysters or melon or clams > # Fish or entrée > # Roast > # Salad > # Dessert > After-dinner coffee In addition to the set courses, little relish dishes of radishes, celery, olives, or almonds could be set on the table as \\"hors-d'œuvre\\". Wines, too, were often greatly reduced in number. Amy Vanderbilt noted in her book, The Complete Book of Etiquette, \\"At a formal dinner champagne may be the only wine served after the service of sherry with the soup.\\" This five-course service might be further reduced by serving either soup or fish (or shellfish) as a first course, but not both. Dinners in the French style usually include a cheese course after the roast, generally resulting in a 6-course meal (see, for example, the formal menus in Richard Olney's The French Menu Cookbook); alternatively, one or more of the other courses can be omitted (see, for example, the formal menus in Simone Beck's Simca's Cuisine). Dinners in the American style often place the salad as a first course instead of soup, an innovation that appeared in the 1950s in California and was noted by Vanderbilt ; in this arrangement, dessert is served immediately after the roast. Wine service may include a separate wine for each course, or simply be champagne throughout; or, most commonly, service may be limited to three wines: a white for the soup and fish, a red for the roast, and a sweet wine or champagne for dessert. These and similar arrangements of four- and five-course formal dinners were the norm throughout the second half of the 20th century.

Biography The Assyrian Malek family claims to trace its roots back eleven centuries. During the Assyrian Genocide of 1914-1918, Malek-Yonan's family fled to Baghdad during the Great Exodus from Urmia where he was born on 11 October 1924. He died on 14 November 2014 in California. When still a young child, his family migrated back to Iran and finally settled in Tehran. His parents were Yosip (Joseph) and Suriya, both Assyrian. His older sister, Florence, was Knighted in the early 70s and lived in Switzerland where she died on 18 February 2007. His older brother, David, was a renowned engineer in Iran who built many of Iran's major freeways and roadways as well as numerous silos in Russia. His younger brother, Cyrus, left Iran for England when he was only seventeen to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and eventually settled in Paris. Malek-Yonan married Lida Bet-Benyamin, also of Assyrian descent, in Tehran in 1950 and has two daughters: Monica Malek-Yonan and Rosie Malek-Yonan, the author of The Crimson Field and also a cast member of the long-running television series General Hospital. Malek-Yonan studied at Tehran University's Law School, earning a Law Degree in 1946 and a Degree in Political Science in 1947. In 1964 he studied law at Golden Gate Law School in San Francisco, California. He practiced international law for more than fifty years representing many of the American, European and Asian corporations in Iran. He was the attorney for the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the American hostage takeover. He moved to the U.S. after the Iranian Revolution. The Malek-Yonan family has produced many great sons and daughters. Dr. Jesse Malek-Yonan represented the Assyrians of Urmia at the Paris Peace talks in 1919; Milton Malek-Yonan inventor of Malekized Rice; Shushan Malek-Yonan author of a children's book (1927) published in Tabriz, Iran; Rev. Isaac Malek-Yoninan author of several books and essays including The Beloved Physician of Teheran (1933) and Persian Women (1898); Norman Malek-Yonan author of The Christmas Story (1958); Terrence Malick, Oscar-nominated director and writer of The New World (2005), The Thin Red Line (1998), Days of Heaven (1978), Badlands (1973). Sports Three gold medals presented at Mar- Mar Palace in Tehran by the former Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, earned George Malek-Yonan the title of Champion of Champions in Iranian Sports in the fields of track and field, pentathlon and soccer, bringing the total of medals awarded to him to 47. His brother, David, was also awarded numerous gold medals by the Shah. Malek-Yonan played high school soccer, basketball and volleyball. After a chance encounter with Iran's track and field coach, Ahmad Izadpanah, at Amjadieh Stadium (today known as Shahid Shiroudi Stadium), Malek-Yonan became interested in track and field. In 1934 Izadpanah had begun organizing various track and field meets and by 1936, the Iranian Athletics Federation was established and Iran joined the International Amateur Athletics Federation. Malek-Yonan first competed in the long jump and triple jump in 1944 (1323) where he earned two silver medals. The same year he participated in Iran's University competitions in the long jump, the triple jump, javelin and shot put, earning four more silver medals. While studying law at Tehran University, he won a gold medal in table tennis in 1946 (1325) and was a member of the University of Tehran Soccer, Volleyball and Basketball teams. Malek-Yonan was the most decorated athlete at Iran's 1948 (1327) National Athletic Competitions, earning him the title of Champion of Champions. He was the only athlete in 1948 to have received a gold medal as well as winning the Track and Field Cup. He competed in the pentathlon (2 x 100 meters, 1,500 meters, javelin, discus and long jump), as well as the 100 meters, 200 meters and long jump, winning four gold medals and earning first place at the 1948 Olympic Games Qualifiers. However he did not compete at the Olympics.

Harding. He was born in Toledo, Ohio. His father was Champion Tintern Tip Top. He was presented to US President Warren G. Harding by Charles Quetschke of Caswell Kennels and became a celebrity during the Harding administration. Laddie Boy was a faithful dog. When the president played golf and hit a tree, Laddie Boy would run up to the tree and retrieve the ball. Laddie Boy had his own hand carved chair to sit in during Cabinet meetings. The White House held birthday parties for the dog, invited other neighborhood dogs to join, and served them dog biscuit cake. Newspapers published mock interviews with the dog. Laddie Boy had a caretaker. He was the first \\"First Dog\\" to be regularly covered in the national press. Harding and his wife Florence shared a love of animals and the First Lady, also an advocate for the care of abused and neglected animals, soon began employing this handsome dog as a poster child for the national promotion of animal rights issues. Purportedly, the dog howled constantly for three days prior to President Harding's death in August 1923 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, knowing of his master's imminent demise. In memory of President Harding and honoring his former employment as a paperboy, newsboys collected 19,134 pennies to be remelted and sculpted into a statue of Laddie Boy. Harding's widow died before the statue was completed in 1927 and the statue was presented to the Smithsonian Institution. Harding's death and the dog were commemorated in song. (sheet music) After the president's death in 1923, Florence Harding gave the Airedale to Harry Barker, her favorite Secret Service agent. She knew her poor health wouldn't allow her to look after the dog properly. Harry took Laddie home to his family in Boston, and the dog lived a very normal life and was much loved by the Barker family. Laddie's death in 1929 was proclaimed in newspaper headlines across the country. In the summer of 2012, Laddie Boy's unique collar, fashioned from Alaskan gold nuggets, was stolen from the Harding Home and Museum.

He is the author of several nonfiction books, and hundreds of stories and reports from the Middle East, western and eastern Europe as well as Africa over the past two decades. He has won awards for his reporting on human-rights issues, and is the founder of human rights organization A Demand For Action (ADFA) which advocates for persecuted minorities in Iraq, Syria,Turkey and elsewhere in the Middle East. __TOC__ Life and career Nuri Kino is the eldest of four children of an Assyrian family that originates from the village of Kfar-Shomac, south of the City of Midyat, in a region known as Tur Abdin. His parents moved to Germany as guest workers when he was four; in 1974, when he was eight, they visited his grandparents in Sweden and decided to stay because there were more jobs.Aslı Sağlam, \\"Director Nuri Kino: What was done to me created me\\", Hürriyet, 2008. He was kidnapped twice as a child.Sandra Grossman, \\"Nuri Kino: ”Jag vägrar sälja min själ'\\", Journalisten, January 15, 2002 . In 1985 he became one of Sweden's first male medical recorders. He has also run a restaurant; in 1994 he was chosen as Stockholm's most popular restaurant owner.\\"Nuri Kino 2004\\", Sommar & Vinter i P1, P1, May 2004 . In 1998, he graduated from the Poppius School of Journalism in Stockholm. The following year he was in Istanbul when the Marmara earthquake occurred. He was interviewed by international news agencies and wrote a widely cited report on the collapse of buildings that had been known to be weak; this was the real start of his career as a journalist. He has since worked as a freelance investigative journalist for Dagens Nyheter, Expressen, Aftonbladet and Metro. In 2002 he started freelancing for the Swedish radio station Sveriges Radio. His reporting has been focused on human rights, immigration and refugee issues, and he has worked for the media abroad in countries such as Turkey, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the U.S., and the Netherlands (reporting for the BBC and on the Dutch program Dit is de Dag). Nuri Kino was the first journalist to interview Irena Sendler, a Polish nurse who risked her life to smuggle 2,500 Jewish children out of the ghettos of Warsaw during World War II. The article was published in the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter on February 8, 2003. Shortly after that it was translated into several other languages and among others published in Wprost, the largest weekly magazine in Poland. The following year, two Nobel Prize laureates, Wislawa Szymborska and Czeslaw Milosz, nominated Sendler for the Nobel Peace Prize. She was nominated a number of times until her death in May 2008 but never received the prize. However, she received several national and international distinctions for her heroic deeds during the Second World War. After a two-year hiatus from journalism, Kino went to Lebanon to write a report on the Christian minority in Syria, Mellan taggtråden (Between the Barbed Wire), published in 2013; it was widely cited in the media internationally and gave rise to many debates, among them the U.S. Congress Joint Subcommittee Hearing on Religious Minorities in Syria: Caught in the Middle.Joint Subcommittee Hearing: Religious Minorities in Syria: Caught in the Middle, United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, June 25, 2013. He was selected to host the Sommar radio program on P1 on June 18, 2004. Nuri Kino also does aid work, sometimes with the Youth Initiative of the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 2014 he founded A Demand For Action (ADFA), an organization that provides relief and advocates for minorities in the Middle East, particularly Christians in Iraq and Syria.Paul Benjamin, \\"Assyrian Boots on the Ground, Not American\\", Huffington Post, December 8, 2014.About A Demand For Action, retrieved February 19, 2015. From this position, in his home town of Södertälje, Sweden, he has developed a global network of human rights experts and activists who serve as a deep resource on persecuted minorities in the Middle East, frequently sought out by national politicians, multinational organizations, the European Parliament and the United States Congress. In an interview, European Parliamentarian Lars Adaktusson said of Kino, ”If Nuri would not have started ADFA we would not be able to have the ongoing genocide of Christians in Iraq and Syria recognized as a Genocide in the European Parliament. We would probably not even be aware of it. Thanks to ADFA:s tireless work we have been able to even have the U.S. congress to recognize the atrocities as Genocide.” Along with Swedish entrepreneur Gunilla Von Platen, Kino is leading the Swedish part of the Little Angel project; an orphanage that is being built outside Damascus in Syria where children from Iraq and Syria who have lost their families will be able to live, eat, and go to school. Television and film With Yawsef Beth Turo, Kino made Det ohörda ropet (\\"The Cry Unheard,\\" 2001), about the killing of Assyrians in Turkey during World War I.Moussa Esa, \\"Nuri gör en god gärning\\", Hujådå, October 30, 2008 . With Erik Sandberg, Kino made Assyriska - landslag utan land (\\"Assyriska - national team without a nation\\") for Sveriges Television. In 2006 it won the Golden Palm Award at the Beverly Hills Film Festival. With Jenny Nordberg he made the documentary The High Price of Ransom for Dan Rather Reports in 2008. Books In 2007, Kino published By God - Sex dagar i Amman (By God – Six Days in Amman), a report on the consequences of the Iraqi war. In 2010 he wrote Still Targeted: Continued Persecution of Iraq's Minorities, a report for Minority Rights Group International. In 2011, he published Den svenske Gudfadern (The Swedish Godfather), about Milan Ševo, a convicted felon born in Serbia but brought up in Sweden, who claimed that close friends of King Carl XVI Gustaf had given him the task of destroying evidence that linked them and the king to porn clubs. The book was presented as a work of journalism illuminating the attraction that crime has for young people. Journalist Hanne Kjöller of Dagens Nyheter considered the book lacking in both objectivity and criticism of the sources, calling it a \\"portrait of an idol\\".Hanne Kjöller, \\"Milan Sevos makeover\\", Dagens Nyheter, May 27, 2011 . However, the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet reported that Ševo confirmed the information in the book was correct.Victor Stenquist, \\"Maffiabossen om kontakt: 'Förvånad'.

According to the book's publisher, Kino's computer was hacked and threats were made to stop a planned TV film.Annika Bladh, \\"Kungagranskaren tvingas leva under hot\\", Aftonbladet, December 9, 2011 . Kino has also published novels. In 2008 with Jenny Nordberg he published Välgörarna - Den motvillige journalisten (Benefactors - The Reluctant Journalist), a suspense novel whose main character he has said is based on himself; it has been translated into Finnish, German, and Norwegian. In 2010, he and David Kushner published Gränsen är dragen, a novel set against the backdrop of the war in Iraq and the situation of Iraqi Christians; it was published in the U.S. in 2013 as The Line in the Sand.

Her musical style consists of a combination of folk, rock, jazz, and blues, an approach which owes itself to her time writing and performing in the Greenwich Village area of New York City. Life and career Sloan Wainwright is the daughter of Loudon Wainwright Jr. and Martha Taylor. She is a younger sister to Loudon Wainwright III, and aunt to Canadian-American musicians Martha Wainwright and Rufus Wainwright and American musician Lucy Wainwright Roche. She was married to George McTavey, who died in December 2008 after a long illness. They had two sons, Sam and Gabe McTavey. As a performer, Wainwright is known for her rich contralto voice and personal lyrics. Her musical style combines pop, folk, jazz, and blues. Born into a highly acclaimed musical family (youngest sister to Loudon Wainwright, aunt to Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright) her teenage years were largely influenced by a constant flow of diverse artists, writers and musicians. Writing and performing throughout the Greenwich Village scene, she developed her songwriting style. In the mid 1990s, Sloan began to collaborate with guitarist Stephen Murphy. They assembled a band and Sloan released a self-titled debut CD in 1996, 'Sloan Wainwright'. The Sloan Wainwright Band followed with a second release in 1998, a tribute in memory of her mother Martha entitled 'From Where You Are.'

Background Merle Elwin Hansen was born on his family's farmstead north of Newman Grove, Nebraska. After graduating from Newman Grove High School in 1938, Merle attended a business college in Chillicothe, Missouri. Hansen viewed farm policy as an issue of social justice and often urged farmers to align themselves with minorities, environmentalists, the urban poor, labor unions, and other constituencies often regarded as marginalized in American culture. During the Great Depression, Hansen's father was active in the Farmers' Holiday Association, a farm protest organization that advocated the withholding of farm commodities from markets as a means of raising farm prices, and the use of penny auctions as a means of stopping farm foreclosures. The Holiday's plan for increasing prices never proved feasible, but the \\"penny auctions\\" were occasionally successful in preventing banks from foreclosing on individual farmers. In many well-publicized cases, Association members would attend a farm sale regarded by Association members as morally or legally questionable. After bidding no more than a few pennies on each item put up by the auctioneer, they would return everything to the original owners immediately following the auction. Local law enforcement officials often discovered they were powerless to stop these tactics, and individuals at the auction who made earnest bids on the items in the sale were often intimidated into silence by Association members. Hansen's town of Newman Grove was home to one of the movement's most successful locals. Often meeting in an auto-repair garage owned by Hansen's family, the \\"Madison County\\" chapter of the Association gained national attention for several successful actions, including the orchestration of a \\"penny auction\\" in Elgin, NE and the reacquisition of farmer-owned property that had been seized by banks. Deeply affected by these early experiences of direct action and radical populism, Hansen referenced the Association throughout his career. World War II On December 8, 1941, Hansen enlisted in the US Navy as a petty officer. He served mostly in the Pacific theatre and was awarded six battle stars. Following the war, he worked out of Omaha as a multi-state field organizer for the American Veterans Committee, a progressive veterans organization formed to oppose the more conservative American Legion. Farmers Union In the late 1940s, Hansen also worked as a field organizer for the South Dakota Farmers Union, and later for the Iowa Farmers Union, where he worked under IFU President Frederick William Stover (1898–1990), the former liaison between the USDA and the Roosevelt White House. Stover was a close ally of former Vice President Henry C. Wallace and one of the policy authors of the New Deal's innovative but controversial agricultural reforms. Stover would become Hansen's mentor, teaching him many of the Byzantine intricacies of federal farm policy and remaining a close ally and partner of Hansen's from the 1950s to the 1980s. During his time in Iowa with Farmers Union, Hansen became a close friend and supporter of the prominent African American activist Edna Griffin, the organizer of one of the nation's first desegregation campaigns. While working with Griffin in her efforts to integrate Katz Drug Store in Des Moines, Hansen developed a friendship with the Griffin family and became an early and enthusiastic supporter of the civil rights movement. Griffin's husband, an African-American doctor, was the attending physician at the birth of two of Hansen's children. At the outbreak of the Korean War, a conflict erupted between Stover and the National Farmers Union, with Stover opposing American intervention and NFU President James Patton supporting President Truman, with whom he had a close working relationship. This conflict caused the Iowa Farmers Union to splinter into bitterly opposed factions and eventually would cause Stover's removal as state president. In the midst of the controversy, Hansen returned to his family's farm in Madison County, Nebraska. Throughout the 1950s, he continued his involvement in farm politics, serving as a vice president of the U.S. Farmers Association which as newly formed by Fred Stover and working with the local chapter of the burgeoning National Farmers Organization. In the 1970s, Hansen served as the president of Nebraskans For Peace, an anti-war and social justice organization. He also served as a state officer in the American Agriculture Movement, the militant farm organization responsible for orchestrating the \\"tractorcades,\\" a public relations spectacle in which hundreds of farmers drove their tractors through the city streets of Washington DC. North American Farm Alliance In 1983, as the nation's farm crisis deepened, Hansen was elected to serve as the founding chairman of the North American Farm Alliance, a farm protest organization that advocated a return to Roosevelt's New Deal farm policies. The group also sought to construct an active coalition between family farmers and other groups perceived as disenfranchised or marginalized in American life. The group's coalition building included outreach to environmentalists, civil rights organizations, the urban poor, and farmers in developing countries. In August 1983, Hansen and other family farm leaders met with Jesse Jackson in Washington, D.C. during the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. When Jackson announced his presidential candidacy a short while later, Hansen became his chief adviser on agricultural policy. Against the advice of many of his advisors, who told him it would be futile to court rural farmers, Jackson adopted many of Hansen's suggestions. Jackson attended numerous farm protest rallies and his electoral performance in rural counties often surpassed expectations. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Hansen was asked by Jackson to make one of the three speeches formally entering his name into nomination as a candidate. The other nominating speeches were made by future Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry. In 1985, Hansen traveled to Africa with Jackson, meeting with Ministers of Agriculture while Jackson met with heads of state. In 1988, he again worked with Jackson on his presidential campaign. He attended the 1988 Democratic National Convention as an Alternate Delegate and contributed substantially to that year's platform debate on agricultural policy. In addition to his role as President of the North American Farm Alliance, Hansen also served as vice president of the National Save the Family Farm Coalition. In 1985, Hansen was an active supporter of the first Farm Aid concert, and was heavily involved with the crafting of Farm Aid's political message and the distribution of the financial proceeds from the first concert's ticket sales. Throughout the 1980s, Hansen was a prominent spokesman for the concerns of family farmers, often speaking at rallies, protest actions, and with media representatives. He was featured prominently in publications ranging from USA Today, to The New York Times, to Ms. Magazine. As President of the North American Farm Alliance, his primary responsibility was communications outreach and coalition building. An articulate speaker, Hansen's message reached audiences throughout the United States and around the world. Later years In 1990, he largely retired from active involvement in politics, with the notable exception of his endorsement and support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 Presidential election. Hansen joined 51 other family farmer and rural activists in forming 'Family Farmers’ National Alliance for Nader\\\\LaDuke'. From the 1930s to the 1980s, he was involved with most of the nation's major farm protest organizations, often taking leadership roles. He was a strong and consistent advocate of parity price indexing of agricultural commodities, and often encouraged family farmers to align themselves with other marginalized constituencies in American life. An oral history of Hansen's involvement in farm protest movements is available in Coming of Age: The Story of Our Century by Those Who’ve Lived It by Studs Terkel. Hansen's files and records were donated to Iowa State University. The manuscript collection available at ISU in Ames includes his speeches and writings, the organizational archives of the many organizations he was involved with, and exchanges of letters with dozens of correspondents. Some of his records were also sent to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, including most of his records relating to Nebraskans for Peace and the American Veterans Committee.

Different methods are used to examine the dynamics of charge carriers, atoms, and molecules. Many different procedures have been developed spanning different time scales and photon energy ranges; some common methods are listed below. Attosecond-to-picosecond spectroscopy Dynamics on the as to fs time scale is in general too fast to be measured electronically. Most measurements are done by employing a sequence of ultrashort light pulses to initiate a process and record its dynamics. The width of the light pulses has to be on the same scale as the dynamics that is to be measured. Light sourcesTitanium-sapphire laser= Ti- sapphire lasers are tunable lasers that emit red and near-infrared light (700 nm- 1100 nm).Ti-sapphire laser oscillators use Ti doped-sapphire crystals as a gain medium and Kerr-lens mode-locking to achieve sub-picosecond light pulses. Typical Ti:sapphire oscillator pulses have nJ energy and repetition rates 70-100 MHz. Chirped pulse amplification through regenerative amplification can be used to attain higher pulse energies. To amplify, laser pulses from the Ti:sapphire oscillator must first be stretched in time to prevent, damage to optics, and then are injected into the cavity of another laser where pulses are amplified at a lower repetition rate. Regeneratively amplified pulses can be further amplified in a multi-pass amplifier. Following amplification, the pulses are recompressed to pulse widths similar to the original pulse widths. =Dye laser= A dye laser is a four-level laser that uses an organic dye as the gain medium. Pumped by a laser with a fixed wavelength, due to various dye types you use, different dye lasers can emit beams with different wavelengths. A ring laser design is most often used in a dye laser system. Also, tuning elements, such as a diffraction grating or prism, are usually incorporated in the cavity. This allows only light in a very narrow frequency range to resonate in the cavity and be emitted as laser emission. The wide tunability range, high output power, and pulsed or CW operation make the dye laser particularly useful in many physical & chemical studies. =Fiber laser= A fiber laser is usually generated first from a laser diode. The laser diode then couples the light into a fiber where it will be confined. Different wavelengths can be achieved with the use of doped fiber. The pump light from the laser diode will excite a state in the doped fiber which can then drop in energy causing a specific wavelength to be emitted. This wavelength may be different from that of the pump light and more useful for a particular experiment. =X-ray generation= Ultrafast optical pulses can be used to generate x-ray pulses in multiple ways. An optical pulse can excite an electron pulse via the photoelectric effect, and acceleration across a high potential gives the electrons kinetic energy. When the electrons hit a target they generate both characteristic x-rays and bremsstrahlung. A second method is via laser-induced plasma. When very high-intensity laser light is incident on a target, it strips electrons off the target creating a negatively charged plasma cloud. The strong Coulomb force due to the ionized material in the center of the cloud quickly accelerates the electrons back to the nuclei left behind. Upon collision with the nuclei, Bremsstrahlung and characteristic emission x-rays are given off. This method of x-ray generation scatters photons in all directions, but also generates picosecond x-ray pulses. Conversion and characterizationPulse characterization= For accurate spectroscopic measurements to be made, several characteristics of the laser pulse need to be known; pulse duration, pulse energy, spectral phase, and spectral shape are among some of these. Information about pulse duration can be determined through autocorrelation measurements, or from cross- correlation with another well-characterized pulse. Methods allowing for complete characterization of pulses include frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) and spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER). =Pulse shaping= Pulse shaping is to modify the pulses from the source in a well-defined manner, including manipulation on pulse’s amplitude, phase, and duration. To amplify pulse’s intensity, chirped pulse amplification is generally applied, which includes a pulse stretcher, amplifier, and compressor. It will not change the duration or phase of the pulse during the amplification. Pulse compression (shorten the pulse duration) is achieved by first chirping the pulse in a nonlinear material and broadening the spectrum, with the following compressor for chirp compensation. A fiber compressor is generally used in this case. Pulse shapers usually refer to optical modulators which apply Fourier transforms to a laser beam. Depending on which property of light is controlled, modulators are called intensity modulators, phase modulators, polarization modulators, spatial light modulators. Depending on the modulation mechanism, optical modulators are divided into Acoustic-optic modulators, Electro-optic modulators, Liquid crystal modulators, etc. Each is dedicated to different applications. =High harmonic generation= High harmonic generation (HHG) is the nonlinear process where intense laser radiation is converted from one fixed frequency to high harmonics of that frequency by ionization and recollision of an electron. It was first observed in 1987 by McPherson et al. who successfully generated harmonic emission up to the 17th order at 248 nm in neon gas. HHG is seen by focusing an ultra-fast, high-intensity, near-IR pulse into a noble gas at intensities of (1013–1014 W/cm2) and it generates coherent pulses in the XUV to Soft X-ray (100–1 nm) region of the spectrum. It is realizable on a laboratory scale (table-top systems) as opposed to large free electron-laser facilities. High harmonic generation in atoms is well understood in terms of the three-step model (ionization, propagation, and recombination). Ionization: The intense laser field modifies the Coulomb potential of the atom, electron tunnels through the barrier and ionize. Propagation: The free-electron accelerates in the laser field and gains momentum. Recombination: When the field reverses, the electron is accelerated back toward the ionic parent and releases a photon with very high energy. =Frequency conversion techniques= Different spectroscopy experiments require different excitation or probe wavelengths. For this reason, frequency conversion techniques are commonly used to extend the operational spectrum of existing laser light sources. The most widespread conversion techniques rely on using crystals with second-order non-linearity to perform either parametric amplification or frequency mixing. Frequency mixing works by superimposing two beams of equal or different wavelengths to generate a signal which is a higher harmonic or the sum frequency of the first two. Parametric amplification overlaps a weak probe beam with a higher energy pump beam in a non-linear crystal such that the weak beam gets amplified and the remaining energy goes out as a new beam called the idler. This approach has the capability of generating output pulses that are shorter than the input ones. Different schemes of this approach have been implemented. Examples are optical parametric oscillator (OPO), optical parametric amplifier (OPA), non-collinear parametric amplifier (NOPA). TechniquesUltra-fast transient absorption= This method is typical of 'pulse-probe' experiments, where a pulsed laser is used to excite a molecule's electrons from their ground states to higher-energy excited states. A probing light source, typically a xenon arc lamp, is used to obtain an absorption spectrum of the compound at various times following its excitation. As the excited molecules absorb the probe light, they are further excited to even higher states. After passing through the sample, the unabsorbed light from the arc lamp continues to an avalanche photodiode array, and the data is processed to generate an absorption spectrum of the excited state. Since all the molecules in the sample will not undergo the same dynamics simultaneously, this experiment must be carried out many times, and the data must be averaged to generate spectra with accurate intensities and peaks. Unlike TCSPC, this technique can be carried out on non-fluorescent samples. Ultrafast transient absorption can use almost any probe light, so long as the probe is of a pertinent wavelength or set of wavelengths. A monochromator and photomultiplier tube in place of the avalanche photodiode array allows observation of a single probe wavelength, and thus allows probing of the decay kinetics of the excited species. The purpose of this setup is to take kinetic measurements of species that are otherwise nonradiative, and specifically it is useful for observing species that have short-lived and non-phosphorescent populations within the triplet manifold as part of their decay path. The pulsed laser in this setup is used both as a primary excitation source, and a clock signal for the ultrafast measurements. Although laborious and time- consuming, the monochromator position may also be shifted to allow absorbance decay profiles to be constructed, ultimately to the same effect as the above method. =Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy= Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy (2PPE) combine a pump-probe scheme with angle-resolved photoemission. A first laser pulse is used to excite a material, a second laser pulse ionizes the system. The kinetic energy of the electrons from this process is then detected, through various methods including energy mapping, time of flight measurements etc. As above, the process is repeated many times, with different time delays between the probe pulse and the pump pulse. This builds up a picture of how the molecule relaxes over time. A variation of this method looks at the positive ions created in this process and is called time-resolved photo-ion spectroscopy (TRPIS) =Multidimensional spectroscopy= Using the same principles pioneered by 2D-NMR experiments, multidimensional optical or infrared spectroscopy is possible using ultrafast pulses. Different frequencies can probe various dynamic molecular processes to differentiate between inhomogeneous and homogeneous line broadening as well as identify coupling between the measured spectroscopic transitions. If two oscillators are coupled together, be it intramolecular vibrations or intermolecular electronic coupling, the added dimensionality will resolve anharmonic responses not identifiable in linear spectra. A typical 2D pulse sequence consists of an initial pulse to pump the system into a coherent superposition of states, followed by a phase conjugate second pulse that pushes the system into a non-oscillating excited state, and finally, a third pulse that converts back to a coherent state that produces a measurable pulse.[ Mukamel, S. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2000, 51, 691-729.] A 2D frequency spectrum can then be recorded by plotting the Fourier transform of the delay between the first and second pulses on one axis, and the Fourier transform of the delay between a detection pulse relative to the signal- producing third pulse on the other axis. 2D spectroscopy is an example of a four-wave mixing experiment, and the wavevector of the signal will be the sum of the three incident wavevectors used in the pulse sequence. Multidimensional spectroscopies exist in infraredHamm, P., & Zanni, M. (2011). Concepts and Methods of 2D Infrared Spectroscopy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511675935 and visible variants as well as combinations using different wavelength regions. =Ultrafast imaging= Most ultrafast imaging techniques are variations on standard pump-probe experiments. Some commonly used techniques are Electron Diffraction imaging,C. D. LIN* AND JUNLIANG XU, PHYS. CHEM. CHEM. PHYS., 2012, 14, 13133–13145 Kerr Gated Microscopy,GUNDLACH L., PIOTROWIAK P, OPT. LETT. 33 2008, 992 imaging with ultrafast electron pulses HENSLEY C., YANG J., CENTURION M., PHYS. RE V. LETT., 2012, 109, 133202-1-133202-5, and terahertz imaging.PICKWELL E., WALLACE V., J. PHYS. D: APPL. PHYS.,2012, 39, R301-R310 This is particularly true in the biomedical community where safe and non-invasive techniques for diagnosis are always of interest. Terahertz imaging has recently been used to identify areas of decay in tooth enamel and image the layers of the skin. Additionally, it has shown to be able to successfully distinguish a region of breast carcinoma from healthy tissue. Another technique called Serial Time- encoded amplified microscopy has shown to have the capability of even earlier detection of trace amounts of cancer cells in the blood.Goda K. et al., PNAS 2012, 109, 11630-11635 Other non-biomedical applications include ultrafast imaging around corners or through opaque objects. =Femtosecond up- conversion= Femtosecond up-conversion is a pump-probe technique that uses nonlinear optics to combine the fluorescence signal and probe signal to create a signal with a new frequency via photon upconversion, which is subsequently detected. The probe scans through delay times after the pump excites the sample, generating a plot of intensity over time.http://www.dmphotonics.com/Femtosecond%20Fluorescene%20Up- Conversion%20Spectrometer%20with%20femtosecond%20Ti%20sapphire%20laser/Trotzky_JPhysDApplPhys_42_2009.pdf ApplicationsApplications of femtosecond spectroscopy to biochemistry= Ultrafast processes are found throughout biology. Until the advent of femtosecond methods, many of the mechanism of such processes were unknown.[ Mathies, R. A. In Ultrafast Processes in Chemistry and Photobiology; El-Sayed, M.A.; Tanaka, I.; Molin, Y.; Ed. Oxford: Cambridge, 1995; pp 215-225.][ Sundström, V. Annu.Rev.Phys.Chem 2008, 59, 53-77.] Examples of these include the cis-trans photoisomerization of the rhodopsin chromophore retinal, excited state and population dynamics of DNA, and the charge transfer processes in photosynthetic reaction centers Charge transfer dynamics in photosynthetic reaction centers has a direct bearing on man’s ability to develop light harvesting technology, while the excited state dynamics of DNA has implications in diseases such as skin cancer.[Schlau-Cohen, G., S.; De Re, E.; Cogdell, R. J. ; Flemming, G. R.; J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013. 3, 2487-2492][ Martinez, T.J.; Hudock, H.R. ChemPhysChem. 2008, 9, 2486-2490] Advances in femtosecond methods are crucial to the understanding of ultrafast phenomena in nature. =Photodissociation and femtosecond probing= Photodissociation is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. It is defined as the interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound, such as visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays. The technique of probing chemical reactions has been successfully applied to unimolecular dissociations. The possibility of using a femtosecond technique to study bimolecular reactions at the individual collision level is complicated by the difficulties of spatial and temporal synchronization. One way to overcome this problem is through the use of Van der Waals complexes of weakly bound molecular cluster. Femtosecond techniques are not limited to the observation of the chemical reactions, but can even exploited to influence the course of the reaction. This can open new relaxation channels or increase the yield of certain reaction products. Picosecond-to-nanosecond spectroscopy=Streak camera Unlike attosecond and femtosecond pulses, the duration of pulses on the nanosecond timescale are slow enough to be measured through electronic means. Streak cameras translate the temporal profile of pulses into that of a spatial profile; that is, photons that arrive on the detector at different times arrive at different locations on the detector. Time-correlated single photon counting Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is used to analyze the relaxation of molecules from an excited state to a lower energy state. Since various molecules in a sample will emit photons at different times following their simultaneous excitation, the decay must be thought of as having a certain rate rather than occurring at a specific time after excitation. By observing how long individual molecules take to emit their photons, and then combining all these data points, an intensity vs. time graph can be generated that displays the exponential decay curve typical to these processes. However, it is difficult to simultaneously monitor multiple molecules. Instead, individual excitation-relaxation events are recorded and then averaged to generate the curve. Schematic of a TCSPC setup This technique analyzes the time difference between the excitation of the sample molecule and the release of energy as another photon. Repeating this process many times will give a decay profile. Pulsed lasers or LEDs can be used as a source of excitation. Part of the light passes through the sample, the other to the electronics as \\"sync\\" signal. The light emitted by the sample molecule is passed through a monochromator to select a specific wavelength. The light then is detected and amplified by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The emitted light signal as well as reference light signal is processed through a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) which eliminates timing jitter. After passing through the CFD, the reference pulse activates a time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) circuit. The TAC charges a capacitor which will hold the signal until the next electrical pulse. In reverse TAC mode the signal of \\"sync\\" stops the TAC. This data is then further processed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and multi-channel analyzer (MCA) to get a data output. To make sure that the decay is not biased to early arriving photons, the photon count rate is kept low (usually less than 1% of excitation rate).Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting by Michael Wahl; PicoQuant GmbH, Rudower Chaussee 29, 12489 Berlin, Germany PicoQuant.com This electrical pulse comes after the second laser pulse excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and a photon is eventually emitted from a single molecule upon returning to its original state. Thus, the longer a molecule takes to emit a photon, the higher the voltage of the resulting pulse. The central concept of this technique is that only a single photon is needed to discharge the capacitor. Thus, this experiment must be repeated many times to gather the full range of delays between excitation and emission of a photon. After each trial, a pre- calibrated computer converts the voltage sent out by the TAC into a time and records the event in a histogram of time since excitation. Since the probability that no molecule will have relaxed decreases with time, a decay curve emerges that can then be analyzed to find out the decay rate of the event. A major complicating factor is that many decay processes involve multiple energy states, and thus multiple rate constants. Though non-linear least squared analysis can usually detect the different rate constants, determining the processes involved is often very difficult and requires the combination of multiple ultra-fast techniques. Even more complicating is the presence of inter-system crossing and other non-radiative processes in a molecule. A limiting factor of this technique is that it is limited to studying energy states that result in fluorescent decay. The technique can also be used to study relaxation of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band in semiconductors.

Located next to Sengkang MRT/LRT station, it is the second bus interchange in Singapore to be air conditioned. It was opened on 18 January 2003. History=Old bus interchange The bus interchange was opened on 12 June 1998 as a terminal. At that time, developments around the area in Sengkang New Town were still actively in progress. On 28 April 2001, the temporary bus interchange was located across the road of Sengkang Square. To date, only the main shelter of the old bus interchange remains, connecting Sengkang Square to nearby HDB estates along Compassvale Road. Relocation On 18 January 2003, which was the day Sengkang LRT East Loop opened, Sengkang Bus Interchange was moved to Compass One (formerly known as Compass Point), and integrated with the other transport networks like the Sengkang MRT, Sengkang LRT line and station, all housed under one complex. It is notably the second bus interchange in Singapore to be air-conditioned, after Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. Enhancement To improve ventilation at the former non-air conditioned alighting bays, the Land Transport Authority constructed a new air-conditioned passageway connecting to the existing air conditioned boarding areas in 2007. On 24 November 2014, LTA officially announced the expansion of the interchange to accommodate future bus services under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) Scheme as the current interchange does not have enough parking spaces for more services. The expansion consists of 12 additional parking bays, boarding and alighting facilities, concourse area, staff lounge and a canteen. The expansion works were scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2016.http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id;=dc0ebadf-b3f7-40ed- bfa0-8b133ed609ec The extension, named Compassvale Bus Interchange (formerly referred to as Sengkang Bus Interchange Expansion), is located opposite the current bus interchange along Sengkang Square and it officially opened on 12 March 2017 together with the launch of bus service 374. Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all the bus routes were split into 4 route packages; with bus service 965 under Sembawang-Yishun package, bus service 83 under Loyang package, bus service 156 under Clementi package and the rest are under Sengkang-Hougang package. Currently, bus service 83 (Loyang package) is operated by Go-Ahead Singapore while bus service 965 (Sembawang-Yishun package) is operated by SMRT Buses until 2Q2021 (Tower Transit Singapore from 2Q2021).

It follows the adventures of three companions as they journey across the fictitious land of Deltora, endeavoring to recover the seven gems stolen from the magical Belt of Deltora and defeat allies of the evil Shadow Lord. The series was first published in Australia in 2000, and has since been published in more than 30 countries. As of February 2010, the series has sold over 15 million copies worldwide, including 2 million in AustraliaNews – Scholastic Australia at Scholastic.com.au. It is published by Scholastic in Australia and the United States. In most countries, the series is illustrated by Marc McBride. The series consists of fifteen books: the first eight comprise the Deltora Quest series, the next three comprise the Deltora Shadowlands series (also known as Deltora Quest 2, Deltora II or Deltora 2) and the final four comprise the Dragons of Deltora series (also known as Deltora Quest 3, Deltora III or Deltora 3). There are also six other official bonus books to the series: The Deltora Book of Monsters, Tales of Deltora, The Authorised Ultimate Deltora Quiz Book, How to Draw Deltora Monsters, How to Draw Deltora Dragons and Other Creatures, and Secrets of Deltora. An anime adaptation of the series aired on Japanese television from 6 January 2007 to 29 March 2008. An anime adaptation also aired in Australia for a short time. A Nintendo DS game for Deltora Quest has also been made in Japan. In an interview as part of the 2011 Australian Council of the Arts Get Reading! Program Emily Rodda announced that she had sold the movie rights of the Deltora Quest series to a \\"prominent Hollywood production company.\\" In May 2015, a new series of books by Emily Rodda set in the world of Deltora was announced by Scholastic. The title of the series is Star of Deltora, and the first installment, Shadows of the Master, was released in August 2015. Plot=Deltora Quest The first series of Deltora Quest follows the journeys of Lief, the son of a humble blacksmith [in disguise], who, on his sixteenth birthday, sets out to fulfill his father's quest to restore the Belt of Deltora. Joining Lief is an ex-palace guard named Barda. Along the way they meet with Jasmine: a wild girl from the Forests of Silence, who has long, brown hair and green eyes. She can speak to trees and has two pets: a raven named Kree and a small, grey, furry creature called Filli. Their quest is to find the seven gems of the fabled Belt of Deltora: the topaz, the ruby, the opal, the lapis lazuli, the emerald, the amethyst, and the diamond. The gems each have a special power and are hidden in dangerous locations around Deltora. The three friends must face numerous perils to reach them. Once the Belt is complete and the proper descendant of the first King of Deltora, Adin, wears the belt, the evil tyranny of the Shadow Lord will be forced back to the Shadowlands. The books in this series are The Forests of Silence, The Lake of Tears, City of the Rats, The Shifting Sands, Dread Mountain, The Maze of the Beast, The Valley of the Lost, and Return to Del. Deltora Quest 2 In Deltora Quest 2, Lief, Barda, and Jasmine go on a quest below the land of Deltora, and travel through strange societies underground. They were formed by the three tribes of the former inhabitants of the Shadowlands, which was long ago a beautiful land called Pirra, which the Shadow Lord repressed by preventing the magic of the Pirran Pipe from protecting the land. The three adventurers convince each tribe to lend them their pieces of the Pipe, before Lief, Barda and Jasmine travel into the Shadowlands itself to use the Pipe to hold off the Shadow Lord and his evil power long enough for the thousands of Deltoran slaves to escape. The books are Cavern of The Fear, The Isle of Illusion, and The Shadowlands. Deltora Quest 3 In Deltora Quest 3, the three companions once again must save Deltora, this time from the Four Sisters, evil creations of the Shadow Lord. These four Sisters sing their songs of death across Deltora, poisoning the land and gradually causing Deltora's crops to wither, resulting in famine across the land. With only a part of a torn map, left by Doran the Dragonlover, they set out to find these Sisters and destroy them. Each Sister must be destroyed with the aid of a dragon. When each Sister and the Sister's guardian are destroyed, another fragment of the map is found. Eventually they discover that the Sisters are hidden in the four most eastern, northern, western and southern corners of Deltora. The Sister of the East is hidden in Dragon's Nest. The Sister of the North is hidden at Shadowgate and the Sister of the West is on the Isle of the Dead. The Sister of the South is hidden in the city of Del, which happens to be the hometown of Lief. However, after Lief, Barda and Jasmine defeat the last Sister, Lief realises that in the exact middle of Deltora, a huge bubble made of poisonous grey liquid is rising from the land. Together with Barda and Jasmine, and all the dragons, he must defeat it. The books are named after the Sister's locations Dragon's Nest, Shadowgate, Isle of the Dead, and The Sister of the South. Supplementary works In the Deltora series, apart from the books which tell the story, there are a number of companion books. These books include the following: The Deltora Book of Monsters: This book goes through all the monsters and other deadly things that exist in the world of Deltora. Through the original Deltora Quest to Dragons of Deltora. They go through the beasts that cause the history through certain landmarks, such as Reeah from the City of the Rats. The book is also \\"written\\" by Josef, the palace librarian in King Lief and King Alton's time. Tales of Deltora: This book tells of how the land of Deltora came to be, how the seven gems came to be, how the Shadow Lord came to be and many other things that evolved to become secrets, that just had to be released in this highly detailed book, with 20 new illustrations by Marc McBride (Illustrator), and tales that make up some of the legends. The book was \\"written\\" by Josef, who in the Deltora Quest 2 and Deltora Quest 3 series is the palace librarian of the city Del. Outside of the Deltora universe, the book was written by Emily Rodda and published by Scholastic Press in 2006. A new version with three extra stories of the isle of Dorne, bridging the gap between the Three Doors trilogy and the Deltora Quest series by expanding on the history of Dorne as well as the Shadow Lord, was published in 2013. Secrets of Deltora: This book was \\"written\\" by Doran the Dragonlover as a travel guide for Deltora. Outside of the Deltora universe, it was written by Emily Rodda and published by Scholastic Press. The Land of Dragons: Although it does not have the word \\"Deltora\\" in the title, this book is related to the Deltora Quest series. It contains tales of the isle of Dorne, bridging the gap between the Three Doors trilogy and Deltora Quest. The book was offered for free as part of the Australian Council of the Arts Get Reading! Program. The tales of Dorne were later included in a 2013 paperback re-release of Tales of Deltora. Other books include How to Draw Deltora Monsters and The Ultimate Deltora Quiz Book. The former book, which details the drawing of Deltoran monsters, was more associated with Marc McBride than Emily Rodda, seeing that he is the illustrator. At the Melbourne Writer's Festival, Rodda announced that the lands in Rowan of Rin are set in the same world as Deltora, to its east. In the back of the paperback version of the Star of Deltora books, starting with Shadows of the Master, there is also an author's note that states that Rowan of Rin, The Three Doors and Deltora Quest are set in the same world. Main characters=Lief  Barda describes Lief as \\"a young hot-head\\" who spends his time roaming the streets and both tempting and dodging trouble. On his 16th birthday he leaves Del on his father's quest to find the magical gems missing from the Belt of Deltora and the heir destined to wear it. Lief is tempted in many ways and by the end of the first series he has grown not only in bravery and strength, but also in wisdom and patience. Lief is very courageous and extremely trustworthy. A few times he considers giving up the quest, but the thought of his friends or allies suffering always helps him to continue. The second series sees the characters questioning their trust of one another as they plot to save the slaves in the Shadowlands. In the third series, Lief and friends once more quest around Deltora, awakening the ancient dragons which help him destroy the Sisters of the North, South, East, and West. In the eighth book, it is told that Lief's hair is dark. It is implied in Isle of the Dead that he is at least eighteen. During the second series, Lief and Jasmine's romantic feelings for each other become more pronounced, and at the end of the third series, they got married and have three children, a daughter named Anna after Jasmine's mother and twin sons called Jarred after Jasmine's father and Endon after Lief's father. Barda At the beginning of the series Barda appears to be a poor beggar living on the streets of Del. He escaped the palace the day the Shadow Lord attacked and his mother, Mrs Minns, died. He escaped the palace and became a beggar because he knew he would be the next target that the enemy would try to kill after his mother. He is revealed to be an ex-palace guard who assumes the role of protector to Lief, much to both his and Lief's dismay. He is a skilled swordsman and often makes grim jokes about being stuck with two young hot-heads (Lief and Jasmine). During the series, Barda competes in a contest in which he describes his special skill as strength. He helps Lief and Jasmine along the quest and is always stronghearted, never gives up hope and is rather a gentle giant. At the end of the third series Barda finds love and happiness with Lindal of Broome, whom he marries and together they have six children. Jasmine Jasmine is 16, approximately the same age as Lief. She is described as having black/brown hair which frames her brown, elfish face and emerald green eyes. When she was first introduced she wore the tattered remains of the uniforms of Grey Guards. She is often described as impatient and lonely, but with a good heart. In the beginning of the series, Jasmine is a wild orphan girl who lives a solitary life in the dangerous Forests of Silence with her pets, Kree, a raven, and Filli, a small, grey, furry creature. She meets Lief and Barda when the pair gets trapped in the Forests by the Wenn. Jasmine understands the language of trees and many other animals. She is independent, like Lief, though she displays far less tact. She is also unafraid of standing up for what she believes in; if she feels something is unjust or incorrect she explains her view without any fear of the consequences. She believes in equal rights and fairness. However, she cannot understand people who will not fight for themselves. Jasmine knows how to defend herself, is more agile than most people and can balance on things very easily. These are a result of her upbringing in the Forests. That also causes her to be used to getting her own way, which causes conflict with her companions. In the beginning of the series, she had no understanding of money. In The Forests of Silence, when Jasmine touches the topaz (the topaz has power to contact to the spirit world), she sees her mother there, who tells Jasmine to join the quest with Lief and Barda to save Deltora. She shows romantic interest in Lief, even though they do not always see eye to eye. She has a very short temper, resulting in many people describing her as \\"wild\\". Concepts A recurring political idea expressed in the series is that a leader who does not understand ordinary people is doomed to failure. Another political concept focuses on the disastrous results of leaders who ignore history. The final books explore the nature of despair. The 1st and 2nd series explores the idea of \\"united we stand, divided we fall\\". The concept of gambling, and how it equates to trickery also revisits the story occasionally. A heavy emphasis on the importance of the natural world is also present, particularly in the third series. Adaptations Rodda has said there has been some interest in adapting the Deltora series into a film but she refused to let any adaptation change the story. There is also a Nintendo DS real-time RPG confirmed with all three characters.Fantasy Writers :: Sunday Profile Australian Broadcasting Corporation A 65 part Deltora Quest anime series of the first eight books began its broadcast season in Japan on 6 January 2007. Rodda chose this option because she and her kids \\"love Japanese anime, and want any adaptation of Deltora to be cool\\". The series is produced at Oriental Light and Magic and is directed by Mitsuru Hongo. At least one noticeable alteration has been made in the studio's adaptation: Lief's hair color has been changed from black to blonde. Rodda has not ruled out a live action version of the story (either film or television) being made at some point in the future, but she intends to wait until she gets an offer that \\"is genuinely admiring of the books as they are\\". There is currently a manga adaptation by Makoto Niwano, serialised in Bom Bom Comics and published by Kodansha. In 2011 Rodda announced in an interview on Girl.com.au as part of the Australian Council of the Arts Get Reading! Program that she had sold the film rights to a \\"prominent Hollywood production company\\" and that she hopes it will be what her fans hope. The status of the project is currently unknown.

A Réseau plate is a transparent sheet of glass or plastic engraved with a grid of crosshatches called fiducial markers. It was commonly used in film cameras (before the advent of digital media) for scientific and technical photography. The plate is placed at the focal plane of the camera just in front of the film. When the frame is exposed the fiducial markers scatter incoming light, creating a permanent shadow on the negative. The fiducial markers on a Réseau plate are sometimes called reticles. The Latin root of fiducial means trust, confidence; fiducial markers are trustworthy reference points. The Latin root of reticle means small meshwork bag, small net; a grid of reticles has a net-like appearance. Purpose and function If the film negative is properly printed the fiducial markers will be evenly spaced on the positive image. Uneven spacing reveals that the image has been distorted. Identical spacing on adjacent images (e.g. from a series of aerial photos) ensures that printing magnification is consistent. Irregularities in the grid can also result from incorrect positioning of the film in the camera, physical distortion of the film media in the development process, and (if digitally scanned) the nonlinearity of the image scanner. These errors may be visually imperceptible but limit the precision of measurements. Because the position of the marks is very precisely known, the image can easily be corrected to account for these effects. When used for photogrammetry, multiple images can be combined using the fiducial marks and knowledge of the camera geometry to enable measurement of distances between objects in the images. Use on lunar cameras The Hasselblad lunar surface data camera was fitted with a Réseau plate. The Réseau plate was made of glass and was fitted to the back of the camera body, extremely close to the film plane. The plate was 5.4 × 5.4 cm in the film plane, which was the useful exposure area on the 70 mm film. The Réseau plate was engraved with a 5 × 5 grid of crosses. The intersections of the crosses were 10 mm apart and accurately calibrated to a tolerance of 0.002 mm. Except for the double-sized central cross, each of the four arms on a cross was 1 mm long and 0.02 mm wide. The crosses (also known as fiducials) were recorded on every exposed frame and provided a means of determining angular distances between objects in the field-of-view. When the Hasselblad lunar surface data camera was fitted with a 60 mm lens, the images of the Réseau crosses on the film have an apparent separation of 10.3 degrees. With a 500 mm lens fitted, the apparent separation is 1.24 degrees.

Forgotten Patriots: The Untold Story of American Prisoners During the Revolutionary War. Basic Books 2008. She became infamous due to the harsh conditions in which the prisoners were kept. Thousands of men were crammed below decks where there was no natural light or fresh air and few provisions for the sick and hungry. As many as 1,100 men were imprisoned at a time in a ship designed for 400 sailors, and as many as 8,000 prisoners were registered on Jersey over the course of the war. James Forten was one of those imprisoned aboard her during this period. Political tensions only made the prisoners' days worse, with brutal mistreatment by the British guards becoming fairly common.

Christopher Vail, of Southold, who was aboard Jersey in 1781, later wrote: In 1778, Robert Sheffield of Stonington, Connecticut, escaped from one of the prison ships, and told his story in the Connecticut Gazette, printed 10 July 1778. He was one of 350 prisoners held in a compartment below the decks. The Department of Defense currently lists 4,435 US battle deaths during the Revolutionary War. Another 20,000 died in captivity, from disease, or for other reasons. Estimates of deaths aboard the New York prison ships vary around 8,000. Prisoner exchanges were hardly possible for two reasons: the British often captured far more prisoners than the Americans did, and George Washington did not favor exchanging veteran British soldiers for ragtag American troops, as it would only put his army at a greater disadvantage.

Some of the dunes are covered in shrubs and grasses, while others are completely bare. After the end of the Pinedale glaciation, the Holocene glacial retreat exposed the sand dunes that had been deposited in their current location by the vast continental glaciers.

It is composed of what was formerly Batha Prefecture with some slight boundary adjustments. The capital of the region is Ati. Geography The region borders Borkou Region to the north, Wadi Fira Region and Ouaddaï Region to the east, Sila Region to the south-east, Guéra Region to the south, Hadjer- Lamis Region to the south-west, and Bahr el Gazel Region to the west. The terrain is generally savannah grassland, merging into the Sahara Desert in the sparsely populated north of the region. Lake Fitri is located in the south- west of the region. Settlements Ati is the capital of the region; other major settlements include Am Sack, Assinet, Djédaa, Haraze Djombo Kibit, Hidjelidjé, Oum Hadjer and Yao. Demographics As per the Chadian census of 2009, the population of the region was 527,031, 51.9% female. The average size of household as of 2009 is 5.1 in rural households and 5.4 in urban areas. The number of households was 103,261: 89,991 in rural areas and 13,270 in urban areas. The number of nomads in the region was 37,419, 9.6% of the population. There were 526,008 people residing in private households. There were 221,810 people above 18 years of age: 98,651 male and 123,159 female. The sex ratio was 0.93 (93 females per 100 males). The main ethnolinguistic groups are Arab groups such as the Baggara, who predominantly speak Chadian Arabic (33.62%), Dar Daju Daju (percentage not known), Lisi groups such as the Bilala (18.11%) and Naba-Kuka (15.71%), the Masalit (5.73%) and the Masmaje (5.61%). Economy As of 2015, internet and telephone were limited and post was the primary mode of communication. In 2016 gold was discovered in the region, and many people from all over Chad, and some from as far away as Niger and Sudan, began flocking here. However, the Chadian army moved to prevent anyone from getting into the region. Administration As a part of decentralisation in February 2003, Chad was administratively split into regions, departments, municipalities and rural communities. The prefectures which were originally 14 in number were re-designated in 23 regions. The regions are administered by Governors appointed by the President. The Prefects, who originally held the responsibility of the 14 prefects, still retained the titles and were responsible for the administration of smaller departments in each region. The members of local assemblies are elected every six years, while the executive organs are elected every three years. As of 2016, there are 23 regions in Chad, which are divided based on population and administrative convenience.

Reproduction The adults emerge from the caterpillar hibernation stage and have one flight cycle in early spring from March to June and the female lays eggs on the base of new pine needles. The adult pair produce only one brood. The mature larvae are 15 mm long. The head of the caterpillar is green and the fine hair covered body is velvet green with cream to yellow stripes. It is a defoliating insect that feeds on the young pine needles until it enters hibernation in late July or August. Status The western pine elfin has few predators and its conservation status is globally secure with no real threats.

He is the former head men's basketball coach at Washington State University.Ernie Kent Washington State bio Prior to Washington State, he served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Oregon and at Saint Mary's (CA). Kent was previously an assistant at Stanford University and also coached abroad in Saudi Arabia. Kent was a college basketball commentator with the Pac-12 Network. Basketball player Kent played for the Oregon Ducks from 1973 to 1977 under head coach Dick Harter. Nicknamed \\"Million Moves\\", he was a part of the Kamikaze Kids, known for constant hustle and extremely aggressive play in their attempts to win ball games. Knee injuries ended his collegiate career. Kent played high school basketball for West High School in Rockford, Illinois. As a Class of 1973 senior, he was named Parade Magazine All-American, Scholastic All-America by Scholastic Magazine, Illinois High School Association (IHSA) All-State, received the American Legion Outstanding Achievement Award, and was a member of the National Honor Society. Coaching career=Early coaching career Between 1980 and 1987, Ernie Kent spent his days in Saudi Arabia coaching basketball for the Al-Khaleej Club. Kent and his wife were immersed in Arab culture, living in a Shiite Muslim village for their first two years, also working for the Arabian American Oil Company in Dhahran. He recalls learning how to be patient, since a translator was required for communication with his team. It was a stressful period of his life and taught him how to deal with extreme pressure. After returning to the United States from Saudi Arabia, he became an assistant coach at Colorado State University, then at Stanford University under head coach Mike Montgomery. He later went on to become the head coach at Saint Mary's College of California where he remained for six years. While at Saint Mary's, Kent's coaching relationship with the players changed drastically. There he coached now actor Mahershala Ali. His players told Kent that they could not relate to him due to his militaristic style. From that moment on, Kent reversed his stance and became more compassionate toward his players. Before each season began he took his players on a retreat, where his players bonded with each other, strengthening the cohesiveness of the team, a tradition he continued at the University of Oregon. Oregon Kent was hired in 1997 to replace Jerry Green, who was leaving for a position at the University of Tennessee, Kent was the first African American head coach to be hired in the history of the Oregon Ducks athletic department in any sport. Under Kent, the Ducks reached the NCAA tournament five times, in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2008, reaching the Elite Eight in 2002 and 2007–Oregon's deepest runs in the tournament in 42 years. He also led the Ducks to the National Invitation Tournament Final Four in 1999 and 2004. In the 2002 season, Kent led the team to its first conference title since 1939 despite the Pacific-10 Conference sending a record of six teams into the NCAA tournament. Under Kent, Oregon was known for playing an up-tempo pace and guard-heavy lineups. As head coach, Kent was known for his recruiting ability, bringing in a class of highly regarded recruits in 2004 such as Maarty Leunen, Bryce Taylor, Chamberlain Oguchi and Malik Hairston.eDuck Basketball Recruiting class of 2004 commits He was highly criticized for failing to sign two of the highest profile recruits to come from the state of Oregon for the class of 2007, Kyle Singler and Kevin Love. The following year, he signed the #21 recruiting class.Scout.com Basketball 2008 Recruiting Class Rankings During his tenure, he had four players drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft in Fred Jones, Luke Ridnour, Luke Jackson and Aaron Brooks. A decline in the success of his teams between 2004 and 2006, the perceived lack of development of highly regarded recruits as well as rumors of personal issues led many people to question whether Kent would remain at Oregon after the 2005–2006 season. But after the season, the school's athletic director at the time, Bill Moos, issued a statement affirming his support for Kent. The team regained its composure the following year and finished the season within the Elite Eight in the 2007 NCAA tournament. Senior point guard Aaron Brooks said that he felt the team let Kent down the previous season for wanting to play in an up-tempo style but not conditioning for it. After the 2008–2009 season when Kent posted his worst record with Oregon, questions whether Kent would be retained resurfaced. Kent remained the head coach, but following a second-to-last finish in the Pac-10 in the 2009–10 season, Kent was fired. His 235 wins were the most in school history, though he has since been passed by his successor, Dana Altman. Washington State On March 31, 2014, Kent was hired to replace Ken Bone as the Men's Basketball coach at Washington State University. His tenure at Washington State was nowhere near as successful as his tenure at Oregon; in five years, the Cougars never had a winning season and never finished higher than eighth in Pac-12 play. He was fired later on March 14, 2019, one day after losing to University of Oregon in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament. Personal life Ernie Kent was born January 22, 1955 in Rockford, Illinois and has three adult children: Marcus, Jordan and McKenzie. Jordan Kent was a three-sport letterman for the University of Oregon in track & field, basketball and football. With his degree in community service and public affairs, he was also heavily involved in community service in Eugene, earning the 2004 Hope Award from the Oregon Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Kent is also active with the American Cancer Society and the Coaches Versus Cancer campaign while being the honorary chairman of the Children's Miracle Network.

It is the stylized representation of a traditional folk or national dance, mostly from European countries, and uses movements and music which have been adapted for the theater. Character dance is integral to much of the classical ballet repertoire. A good example of character dance within ballet is the series of national dances which take place at the beginning of Act II of Swan Lake. The ballet Don Quixote also features many character variations based on traditional Spanish dances. Popular character dance adaptations for ballet also include the national dances of Hungary , Russia, Poland, Italy and Spain: csárdás, mazurka, tarantella, flamenco, etc. One of the best known schools that incorporate character dance to teaching syllabus is Vaganova Ballet Academy. Outside of Russia and the former republics of the late Soviet Union, there is little training in the art of character dance. However, it is still widely taught in the United Kingdom and Australia and in Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary) where it is integral to the training of students at the Royal Ballet School and the Australian Ballet School. It is also taught as a separate skill within the graded examinations syllabus of the Royal Academy of Dance, Statni Konzervator Praha. Most performing companies or schools elsewhere are not familiar with the history or technique of this style. Therefore, the term character dance is often used in misleading ways that have no bearing to the original definition in ballet terminology. Yuri Slonimsky writes in his book The Bolshoi Ballet (Second edition 1960, p.8) on the history of character dance: Folk traditions have been incorporated into what is known as ballet for centuries but it was not until Aleksandr Shirayev, Assistant to Marius Petipa, that character dance became a unique and codified art-form that takes its rightful place as an integral part of classical ballet. Character dances are usually performed in shoes or boots, with a suede sole and a small heel. Men typically wear black character shoes and women typically wear a flesh coloured shoe with a larger, more feminine heel, but sometimes black shoes too.

Fads are objects or behaviors that achieve short-lived popularity but fade away. Fads are often seen as sudden, quick-spreading, and short-lived. Fads include diets, clothing, hairstyles, toys, and more. Some popular fads throughout history are toys such as yo-yos, hula hoops, and fad dances such as the Macarena and the twist. Similar to habits or customs but less durable, fads often result from an activity or behavior being perceived as emotionally popular or exciting within a peer group, or being deemed \\"cool\\" as often promoted by social networks.Kornblum (2007), p. 213. A fad is said to \\"catch on\\" when the number of people adopting it begins to increase to the point of being noteworthy. Fads often fade quickly when the perception of novelty is gone. Overview The specific nature of the behavior associated with a fad can be of any type including unusual language usage, distinctive clothing, fad diets or frauds such as pyramid schemes. Apart from general novelty, mass marketing, emotional blackmail, peer pressure, or the desire to \\"be hip\\" may drive fads.Domanski (2004), pp. 147–159. Popular celebrities can also drive fads, for example the highly popularizing effect of Oprah's Book Club. Though some consider the term trend equivalent to fad, a fad is generally considered a quick and short behavior whereas a trend is one that evolves into a long term or even permanent change.Arena (2001), p. 341. Economics In economics, the term is used in a similar way. Fads are mean-reverting deviations from intrinsic value caused by social or psychological forces similar to those that cause fashions in political philosophies or consumerisation.Camerer (1989).  Difference between fads and trends  The words \\"fad\\" and \\"trend\\" are sometimes used interchangeably. However, according to Sarah Burke of getspokal.com, fads can be distinguished from trends in three ways: their reason for rise, their incubation period and life span, and their scope. Fads tend to have a huge surge in popularity, and then disappear. In contrast, trends have explainable rises, and are driven by functional needs. Trends tend to rise in popularity more slowly. They reflect deep-rooted human desires and needs, while fads are generally driven by the emotional need to purchase. This emotional need can come from the hype that surrounds the product. Trends rise slowly over time, but fads’ popularity spike quickly and they end up dying out just as quickly. Fads might last for just weeks or months. Scope is also a factor. A trend encompasses several brands and products which can reach a large variety of people. A fad typically encompasses just one brand, or product, with limited appeal and a narrow scope. An example of a fad would be Beanie Babies. Beanie Babies do not meet many functional needs of humans; their hype is what helped to bring in more customers, not necessarily their functionality. Beanie Babies became very popular for a few years in the 1990s, but then their popularity quickly dropped, and has steadily been dropping since their peak in the 1990s. Beanie Babies were made by one company and had a narrow scope. Further examples of fads include pole sitting, dancing the Shake, and the Tamagotchi. An example of a trend would be handbags. Trends are driven by functional needs, and handbags were created for functionality. The demand for handbags has steadily increased over the years. As for their scope, different types of people use handbags for different reasons: to carry things such as money, personal items, clothes, children’s things, and more. There are also many different brands and types of handbags available. Trends possess some dexterity, which allows them to adapt through the years.  Formation of fads and how they spread  Many contemporary fads share similar patterns of social organization. Several different models serve to examine fads and how they spread. One way of looking at the spread of fads is through the top-down model, which argues that fashion is created for the elite, and from the elite, fashion spreads to lower classes. Early adopters might not necessarily be those of a high status, but they have sufficient resources that allow them to experiment with new innovations. When looking at the top-down model, sociologists like to highlight the role of selection. The elite might be the ones that introduce certain fads, but other people must choose to adopt those fads. Others may argue that not all fads begin with their adopters. Social life already provides people with ideas that can help create a basis for new and innovative fads. Companies can look at what people are already interested in and create something from that information. The ideas behind fads are not always original; they might stem from what is already popular at the time. Recreation and style faddists may try out variations of a basic pattern or idea already in existence. Another way of looking at the spread of fads is through a symbolic interaction view. People learn their behaviors from the people around them. When it comes to collective behavior, the emergence of these shared rules, meanings, and emotions are more dependent on the cues of the situation, rather than physiological arousal. This connection to symbolic interactionism, a theory that explains people’s actions as being directed by shared meanings and assumptions, explains that fads are spread because people attach meaning and emotion to objects, and not because the object has practical use, for instance. People might adopt a fad because of the meanings and assumptions they share with the other people who have adopted that fad. People may join other adopters of the fad because they enjoy being a part of a group and what that symbolizes. Some people may join because they want to feel like an insider. When multiple people adopt the same fad, they may feel like they have made the right choice because other people have made that same choice.  Termination of fads  Primarily, fads end because all innovative possibilities have been exhausted. Fads begin to fade when people no longer see them as new and unique. As more people follow the fad, some might start to see it as \\"overcrowded\\", and it no longer holds the same appeal. Many times, those who first adopt the fad also abandon it first. They begin to recognize that their preoccupation with the fad leads them to neglect some of their routine activities, and they realize the negative aspects of their behaviour. Once the faddists are no longer producing new variations of the fad, people begin to realize their neglect of other activities, and the dangers of the fad. Not everyone completely abandons the fad, however, and parts may remain. A study examined why certain fads die out quicker than others. A marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, Jonah Berger and his colleague, Gael Le Mens, studied baby names in the United States and France to help explore the termination of fads. According to their results, the faster the names became popular, the faster they lost their popularity. They also found that the least successful names overall were those that caught on most quickly. Fads, like baby names, often lose their appeal just as quickly as they gained it.  Collective behavior  Fads can fit under the broad umbrella of collective behavior, which are behaviors engaged in by a large but loosely connected group of people. Other than fads, collective behavior includes the activities of people in crowds, panics, fads, fashions, crazes, and more. Robert E. Park, the man who created the term collective behavior, defined it as \\"the behavior of individuals under the influence of an impulse that is common and collective, an impulse, in other words, that is the result of social interaction\\". Fads are seen as impulsive, driven by emotions; however, they can bring together groups of people who may not have much in common other than their investment in the fad.  Collective obsession  Fads can also fit under the broad umbrella of \\"collective obsessions\\". Collective obsessions have three main features in common. The first, and most obvious sign, is an increase in frequency and intensity of a specific belief or behavior. A fad's popularity increases in frequency and intensity pretty quickly, which is one characteristic that distinguishes it from a trend. The second is that the behavior is seen as ridiculous, irrational, or evil to the people who are not a part of the obsession. Some people might see those who follow certain fads as unreasonable and irrational. To these people, the fad is ridiculous, and people's obsession of it is just as ridiculous. The third is, after it has reached a peak, it drops off abruptly and then it is followed by a counter obsession. A counter obsession means that once the fad is over, if one engages in the fad they will be ridiculed. A fad's popularity often decreases at a rapid rate once its novelty wears off. Some people might start to criticize the fad after, pointing out that it is no longer popular, so it must not have been \\"worth the hype\\".

Roustabouts unloading cotton from steamboat ca. 1900. Roustabout (Australia/New Zealand English: rouseabout) is an occupational term. Traditionally, it referred to a worker with broad-based, non-specific skills. In particular, it was used to describe show or circus workers who handled materials for construction on fairgrounds. In modern times it is applied to rural employment, such as those assisting sheep shearing, and positions in the oil industry. Oil industry in the US Oil roustabout refers to a worker who maintains all things in the oil field. Roustabout is an official classification of natural gas and oil rig personnel. Roustabouts working in oil fields typically perform various jobs requiring little training. Drillers start off as roustabouts until they gain enough hands-on experience to move up to a roughneck or floorhand position, then to driller and rig supervisor. Roustabouts will set up oil well heads, maintain saltwater disposal pumps, lease roads, lease mowing, create dikes around tank batteries on a lease, etc. An oil roustabout has no limits in the oil industry and can, and will do any and all oil field work, including roughneck drilling, oil well completion and well service, and even chemical work. An oil field roustabout will also do all things that an oil field pumper would have to do. However, they frequently turn out to be long-term employees and take on more difficult and sometimes dangerous jobs as they gain experience. Most go on to at least become “roughnecks” if they work for the rig company for more than a few months. An early 2010 survey by Careercast.com of the best and worst jobs -- based on five criteria: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands and stress -- rated 'roustabout' as the worst job. Nonetheless, the anecdotal and subjective experience of an actual roustabout suggests that for some, it can be a challenging, adventurous job.  Australia and New Zealand  In Australia and New Zealand a \\"rouseabout\\" can be any worker with broad-based, non-specific skills, in any industry. However, rouseabouts or \\"rousies\\" most commonly work in rural employment, especially sheep farming, as in the film The Sundowners, where they leave town before the sun goes down. In popular culture The term was used in Disney's 1941 animated film Dumbo, during a musical scene in which a group of labourers pulled circus materials off the train for construction. Roustabout was a 1964 musical movie starring Elvis Presley, Barbara Stanwyck, and Joan Freeman, in a story set in a traveling carnival -- for which Presley recorded the song titled \\"Roustabout\\". Farley Granger's character, Arthur \\"Bowie\\" Bowers, in Nicholas Ray's 1948 film noir They Live By Night, tells Catherine \\"Keeetchie\\" Mobley (Cathy O'Donnell) that he was a roustabout with a circus. The term is used in the song \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\", by The Decemberists. \\"Roustabout\\" is also the name of a song recorded by the bluegrass band, Open Road, on their album Lucky Drive. The term is also used by Beats Antique for two songs on their album Collide. The Slamball team Rousties is named after a roustabout. In the musical theater production All Shook Up, the lead character Chad is often referred to as a roustabout. Roughnecks and Roustabouts is the second album by Pete Williams, formerly bassist and vocalist with Dexys Midnight Runners, and currently performing as The Pete Williams Band.

Formed in November 1918, it refused to merge itself with Association for the Defense of the Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Its leadership was decapitated in the aftermath of the 1920 Turkish Grand National Assembly election, leading to its eventual dissolution in 1926. Operation The Karakol society also known as the Black Arm, Sentinel Association or Guard Society, was founded in November 1918, as the first clandestine organization fighting against the Allied Occupation of Constantinople. It served as a continuation of the Committee of Union and Progress' intelligence agency the Special Organization, with the majority of its members coming from the latter. It was founded by Kara Vâsıf Bey and Kara Kemal on Talaat Pasha's orders, soon after he fled the country. The name was chosen on the grounds that it was the amalgamation of the founder's names, a secret password (K.G.) was also adopted. Karakol's central committee consisted of Kara Vâsıf Bey, Baha Said Bey, Refik Ismail Bey, Ali Riza Bey (Bebe), Edip Servet Bey (Tör), Kemalletin Sami Bey and Galatali Sevket Bey. The aims of the organization were outlined as protecting and, where non existent, establishing national unity through legitimate means behind the scenes. Revolutionary action was to be taken in the case of oppressors of freedom and justice. The third article of the declaration of establishment highlighted Karakol's socialist nature. During his stay in Constantinople between November 1918 and May 1919 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk met with Ali Fethi Bey, Kara Kemal, Ismail Canbulat and an unknown fourth person whereupon a revolutionary committee was established. The committee was to assassinate the sultan and overthrow the government, applying pressure on the government that was to succeed it. Canbulat's hesitation temporarily halted the committee's plans, which was later dissolved after its members agreed that the sultan's removal would not be enough to save the crumbling Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Kemal departed for Anatolia which was to become the center of the Turkish resistance movement. Karakol created a line of communication and transportation between Constantinople and Anatolia, smuggling volunteers, weapons, and armaments into the latter. Karakol representatives took part in the Erzurum and Sivas Congresses, where they supported the unification of various resistance organizations under the banner of the Association for the Defense of the Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia (ADRAR), and Karakol went on to publish the Amasya Protocol. However a rift soon emerged between the Karakol leadership and Kemal; Karakol refused to accept Ankara as the center of national resistance and continued to act independently from ADRAR, seeing itself as the real core of the resistance. Kemal became suspicious of Karakol's intentions, ordering it to terminate its activities. Downfall On 11 January 1920, Baha Said Bey traveled to Baku where he signed an alliance with the Bolsheviks, presenting himself as an envoy of the Turkish resistance. On 26 February, Kara Vâsıf Bey informed Kemal of the agreement, which Kemal rebuffed as illegitimate since it was concluded without ADRAR's knowledge or consent. Kemal once more requested Karakol to incorporate itself into ADRAR. Karakol remained defiant, operating until the 1920 Turkish Grand National Assembly election, which was disrupted when British troops entered the parliament and arrested several deputies on 16 March. A part of Karakol's leadership was subsequently exiled to Malta, others either joined Kemal in Ankara or Enver Pasha in the Caucasus. Insignificant remnants of Karakol continued to exist until 1926, however Kemal had already solidified his position at the head of the Turkish National Movement. Karakol's function as an intelligence agency was substituted by a number of other organizations including Yavuz Group, Zabitan Group, Hamza Group. They continued to operate until the end of the independence war. Karakol is considered as one of the precursor organizations to the modern day National Intelligence Organization, MİT.

His minimalist, clean designs often made of cashmere or ultrasuede were a new phenomenon in the mid-1970s discotheques and redefined American fashion. Halston was known for creating a relaxed urban lifestyle for American women. He was frequently photographed at Studio 54 with his close friends Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger and artist Andy Warhol. In the early 1950s, while attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Halston began a business designing and making women's hats. He garnered a well-known clientele and opened a store on Chicago's Magnificent Mile in 1957. He later became the head milliner for high-end New York City department store Bergdorf Goodman. His fame rose when he designed the pillbox hat Jacqueline Kennedy wore to the inauguration of her husband, President John F. Kennedy, in 1961. In the late 1960s, Halston made the transition to women's clothing, opening a boutique on Madison Avenue in New York and started a ready-to-wear line. After several ill advised business decisions, Halston eventually lost control of his fashion house in the 1980s. He died of AIDS-related cancer in 1990 at the age of 57. Early life Roy Halston Frowick was born on April 23, 1932, in Des Moines, Iowa, the second son of Norwegian-American accountant James Edward Frowick and his stay-at-home wife Hallie Mae (née Holmes). Halston developed an early interest in sewing from his grandmother and he began creating hats and altering clothes for his mother and sister. He grew up in Des Moines, and moved to Evansville, Indiana, at the age of ten. He graduated from Benjamin Bosse High School in 1950. He briefly attended Indiana University before enrolling at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Career= Early years  In 1952, Halston moved to Chicago, where he enrolled in a night course at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and he worked as a window dresser. In 1953, he opened his own hat business. His first customer was radio actress and comedian Fran Allison. Halston's hats were also bought by Kim Novak, Gloria Swanson, Deborah Kerr and Hedda Hopper. Halston's first big break came when the Chicago Daily News ran a brief story on his hats. In 1957, he opened his first shop, the Boulevard Salon, on North Michigan Avenue. It was at this point that he began to use his middle name as his professional moniker. During his childhood he had been referred to as Halston to distinguish between himself and his uncle Roy. Halston moved to New York City in late 1957, first working for milliner Lilly Daché. Within a year, he had been named the co-designer at Daché, became acquainted with several fashion editors and publishers, and left Daché's studio to become head milliner for department store Bergdorf Goodman in their customer milliner salon.  Popularity  Halston Ultrasuede shirt dress, 1972 Halston beaded nylon evening caftan, 1977 Halston achieved great fame after designing the pillbox hat Jacqueline Kennedy wore to her husband's presidential inauguration in 1961, and when he moved to designing women's wear, Newsweek dubbed him \\"the premier fashion designer of all America.\\"\\"As Good As the People He Dressed\\", January Magazine. Accessed February 1, 2007 When hats fell out of fashion, Halston moved on to designing clothing, made possible by Estelle Marsh, a millionaire from Amarillo, Texas. Mrs. Marsh was his sole financial backer during this critical time of development. He opened his first boutique on Madison Avenue in 1968. The collection that year included a dark jade velvet wedding gown for advertising executive Mary Wells Lawrence. Lawrence was married to the CEO of Braniff International Airways, Harding Lawrence. She would be instrumental in bringing Halston to Braniff in 1976 to design Braniff's hostess, pilot, ticket agent, and ground personnel uniforms. Halston launched his first ready-to-wear line, Halston Limited, in 1969. Halston's design was usually simple, minimalist yet sophisticated, glamorous and comfortable at the same time. Halston liked to use soft, luxurious fabric like silk and chiffon. He later told Vogue that he got rid of \\"...all of the extra details that didn't work—bows that didn't tie, buttons that didn't button, zippers that didn't zip, wrap dresses that didn't wrap. I've always hated things that don't work.\\" Another design characteristics was the use of bias. He believed that clothes cut and sewn from the bias of every fabric can develop a sexy, polished image. In the past, a woman's body shape was mainly shown through the curve of the clothing. Halston changed the fitted silhouette and showed the female body shape by allowing the natural flow of the fabric to create its own shape. Halston said \\"Pants give women the freedom to move around they've never had before. They don't have to worry about getting into low furniture or low sportscars. Pants will be with us for many years to come—probably forever if you can make that statement in fashion.\\" In the 1970s, his ultra-suede suit was a big hit. He brought in functionality into fashion. He designed the Ultrasuede shirtdress and re-introduced pants for women. The shirtdress was interpreted as an elongated men's shirt. He also included elements of sportswear and combined it into women's clothing, merging features from womenswear and menswear. Halston's boutique drew celebrity clients like Babe Paley, Anjelica Huston, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Margaux Hemingway, Elizabeth Taylor, Bianca Jagger and Liza Minnelli (both Jagger and Minnelli would become close friends).\\"Halston (Roy Halston Frowick) (1932–1990)\\" Obituary. Accessed February 1, 2007 From 1968 to 1973, his line earned an estimated $30 million. In 1973, Halston sold his line to Norton Simon, Inc. for $16 million but remained its principal designer. This afforded him creative control with near unlimited financial backing. In 1975, Max Factor released Halston's first namesake fragrance for women. By 1977, sales from the perfume had generated $85 million in sales. Throughout the 1970s, Halston had expanded his line to include menswear, luggage, handbags, lingerie and bedding. Vogue later noted that Halston was responsible for popularizing caftans, which he made for Jacqueline Kennedy; matte jersey halter top dresses; and polyurethane in American fashion.  Halstonettes  As Halston’s popularity and fame grew, those he worked with also became well known. His favored models included Pat Cleveland, Anjelica Huston, Heidi Goldberg, Karen Bjornson, Beverly Johnson, Nancy North, Chris Royer, Alva Chinn, Connie Cook, and Pat Ast. This entourage of models were eventually dubbed “The Halstonettes” by fashion journalist André Leon Talley. The Halstonettes appeared together in editorials and ads for Halston clothing and cosmetics and appeared at many Halston-related events. The troupe often travelled with Halston, attended his galas, acted as his muses, and reflected ethnic diversity (Halston was one of the first major designers to hire models of different races to walk in his shows and appear in his ads). Uniforms for Braniff Airways Halston was very influential in the design of uniforms. In 1977 he was contracted by Braniff International Airways to create a new look for their flight attendants. He created muted brown uniforms with a distinctive \\"H\\" logo. Halston created interchangeable separates in shades of bone, tan and taupe which the airline extended to the seat covers, using brown Argentinean leather. The entire scheme was dubbed \\"Ultra Touch\\" by the airline in reference to Halston's ultrasuede designs, and was extremely evocative of the late 1970s. An elaborate party was thrown in February 1977, dubbed Three Nights in Acapulco, to introduce the new Halston fashions along with the new and elegant Braniff International Airways. Braniff chairman Harding Lawrence, his wife Mary Wells Lawrence, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, and Halston himself along with his Halstonettes were in attendance for the grand presentation. Halston and his entourage would arrive at selected points during the party in outfits that matched the deep tones of Braniff Airways' new color schemes that would be applied to their aircraft as part of the new so-called Elegance Campaign. The party and the Halston creations were a hit not only with the fashion press but also with Braniff employees, who thought they were the easiest and most comfortable uniforms they had ever worn. He was asked by the U.S. Olympic Committee to design the Pan American Games and U.S. Olympic Team's uniforms in 1976. He also designed the uniforms for the Girl Scouts, the New York Police Department, and the Avis Rent a Car System.  Later years  In 1983, Halston signed a six-year licensing deal worth a reported $1 billion with retail chain J. C. Penney. The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200. At the time, the move was considered controversial, as no other high end designer had ever licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store. While Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high-end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been \\"cheapened\\". Bergdorf Goodman at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced. and other companies contacted Halston about the move, and some reduced their orders. The Halston III line for J. C. Penney was poorly received and was eventually discontinued; however, this would pave the way for other high-end designers to sell their lines at stores of varying price levels in the future. In 1983, Halston Limited, which was owned by Norton Simon, Inc., was acquired by Esmark Inc. After the acquisition, Halston began to lose control over his namesake company and grew frustrated. As the label changed hands (it would be owned by Playtex International, Beatrice Foods and four other companies), Halston continued to lose control and, by 1984, was banned from creating designs for Halston Enterprises. He attempted to buy back his company through protracted negotiations. Halston Enterprises was eventually acquired by Revlon in 1986. Halston was paid a salary by Revlon but had stopped designing clothing for the company but continued designing for family and friends, most notably Liza Minnelli and Martha Graham. After his contract with Revlon expired, he was in talks to sign a new contract with the company but stopped negotiations after he learned that Revlon planned to continue the line without his input. The line continued on with various designers until 1990, when Revlon discontinued the clothing portion of the line but continued selling Halston perfumes.  Personal life  Halston's on- again off-again lover was Venezuelan-born artist Victor Hugo. The two met while Hugo was working as a make up artist in 1972. The two began a relationship and Hugo lived on and off in Halston's home. Halston soon hired Hugo to work as his window dresser. Their on-and-off relationship lasted a little over ten years. According to The New York Times, Halston was known to have had an affair with fashion designer Luis Estevez. Death  In 1988, Halston tested positive for HIV. After his health began to fail, he moved to San Francisco, where he was cared for by his family. On March 26, 1990, he died of Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining illness, at the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. His remains were cremated.  Commemoration  In June 1990, Halston's longtime friend, singer and actress Liza Minnelli sponsored a tribute at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall that was followed by a reception hosted by his friend Elsa Peretti.Reed, J.D. and Kathryn Jackson Fallon. \\"Dressed To sex – and Die.\\" Time. April 9. 1990. In 2010, Halston was the subject of the documentary Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston. From November 2014 to January 2015, a traveling exhibition entitled Halston and Warhol Silver and Suede was sponsored by the Warhol Museum and co- curated by Halston's niece Lesley Frowick. From February to April 2015, an exhibition was held in the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City to celebrate Halston's 1970s fashions. In March 2017, Halston Style, a retrospective of his career, opened at the Nassau County Museum. The retrospective was curated by Halston’s niece Lesley Frowick and features material derived from his personal archives that he gave to her before his death. Frowick also authored the accompanying catalogue, Halston: Inventing American Fashion. In May 2019, the documentary Halston, directed by Frédéric Tcheng was released. The documentary revived interest in Halston and The Halstonettes. In May 2019, The New York Times released an article, \\"Halston’s Women Have Their Say\\" which outlined many of the Halstonette women reflecting on their experience. A similar article was published in August 2019, by CNN titled, \\"Free Inside Our Clothes: Top Models Remember What It Was Like to Walk a Halston Show\\". According to fashion critic Robin Givhan, when Tom Ford relaunched Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in the late 1990s, he found his inspiration in the glittering glamour of Halston's style: \\"When Ford added Yves Saint Laurent to his workload in 1999, he did due diligence in researching the house's history. But his work continued to display a louche attitude that recalled the best of Halston.\\".  Halston Heritage = History  Since Halston's death in 1990, his namesake company changed hands several times. After Revlon ceased production of the clothing portion of the company in 1990, it was purchased by Borghese in 1991. In 1996, sportswear firm Tropic Tex bought the Halston clothing license (Revlon still retains the rights to Halston fragrances) and hired designer Randolph Duke to relaunch the line. Duke's first collection debuted in fall 1997 to critical acclaim. Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Minnie Driver (who wore a crimson Halston dress to the 70th Academy Awards ceremony) were among the celebrities to wear the new Halston creations. By 1998, Duke left the company after it was sold to Catterton-Simon, a private equity fund. Later that year, designer Kevan Hall was hired as head designer for the label then called House of Halston. Hall’s first collection for the label debuted in Spring 1998 to critical acclaim. In 1999, Catterton-Simon sold Halston Enterprises to Neema Clothing. Head designer Kevan Hall left House of Halston in 2000. After Hall’s departure, Halston’s new owner, James J. Ammeen, planned to relaunch the Halston line as a luxury brand and hired designer Bradley Bayou. Bayou's line, Bradley Bayou for Halston, was worn by Oprah Winfrey and Queen Latifah. Bayou left Halston in frustration in 2005 after Ammeen refused to give Bayou more money for advertising. In 2006, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon, stylist Rachel Zoe, and film producer Harvey Weinstein partnered with Hilco Consumer Capital to purchase the line in another effort to relaunch it. Problems about the line's new direction quickly arose when Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe could not agree on a designer. Former Versace designer Marco Zanini was eventually hired in July 2007. Zoe later said she was disappointed with Zanini's designs and was shut out of the designing process. Zanini's Halston collection debuted in February 2008 to mixed reviews. Zanini left Halston in July 2008 and British designer, Marios Schwab, was hired in May 2009. Halston Enterprises then decided to launch a second line called Halston Heritage. The Heritage line is based on archived sketches by Halston with modern updates. In 2009 actress Sarah Jessica Parker wore two Halston Heritage dresses in the film Sex and the City 2 and the company hired her as the president and chief creative officer for the main line. She also oversaw the Halston Heritage line. In February 2011, Marios Schwab released his first Halston collection for the Autumn/Winter season. During her tenure as Creative Director, Sarah Jessica Parker choose iconic jeweler Jacqueline Rabun to design a selection of custom- made silver accessories. Nevertheless, Schwab's collection debuted to negative critical reception. In the August 2011 issue of American Vogue, Sarah Jessica Parker revealed that she had left the company. Schwab and Harvey Weinstein left the company shortly thereafter. In late 2011, Hilco Consumer Capital consolidated ownership and brought in Ben Malka, former president of BCBG, to continue the Halston Heritage business as chairman and CEO. Malka enlisted the help of Marie Mazelis, the former creative director of Max Azria and Hervé Léger, to spearhead the re-launch of the contemporary line. Hilco decided to focus exclusively on the Halston Heritage ready-to-wear activity, and invested an additional $7.5 million for its development. In September 2012, the company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles. In February 2013, Halston Heritage signed a deal with the Majid Al Futtaim Group for distribution of its products in the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, the company sold H by Halston and H Halston to the company Xcel that specializes in bringing fairly known brands to mass market outlets. The fall 2018 collection was focused on athleisure apparel.

Founded on 7 December 1826, it is the second oldest recorded school in the country after only Penang Free School. It was awarded cluster school status and is known as one of the premier schools in Malaysia.  History =Establishment On 7 December 1826, MHS was officially established; just after Malacca was made an English colony on 17 March 1824, when the Dutch ceded Malacca to the English after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. The establishment of the school (then known as Malacca Free School) was initiated by Mr. Thomas H. Moor who came to Malacca in 1825 on orders by William Milne who was one of the educators at the Anglo-Chinese College. In his letter dated 4 January 1825, he stated his wishes to Arundel in London to establish a school. The establishment of the school was also supported by some influential people including James Humphrey, a Superintendent in the London Missionary Society. The startup of Malacca High School was directly related to the closing of the Dutch-Malay school which was established in January 1815 by Christian missionary during the Dutch reign. The school was closed when Malacca was handed over to the English by the Dutch. Locations After the establishment of Malacca High School on 7 December 1826, the school was originally located at Personage House – The current Youth Museum of Malacca. Throughout the history of the school, it moved twice (in 1884 and 1931), due to the increase in students population. In 1884, the school shifted to a new building at the former High Court building as the old building was no longer suitable in accommodating the growing student population, then. This building was built under the leadership of F.C. Shepberd since 1882 but could only accommodate 200 students. The initial idea of building the Malacca High School at the Kubu field was then cancelled when the late Tuan Haji Bachee bin Ahmad offered to sell a plot of the land to the authorities. In 1928, the new school premises at Jalan Chan Koon Cheng (the current location) was built, which included the cost of land. The new school premise is a 2-storey school building constructed in the form of the letter E, which symbolises an English School. The premise was equipped with a teachers’ quarters. In 1934, the ruling British government made additions to the building, constructing quarters for their Boarding Master, car parks, armoury for weapons storage and cadet rooms. Early students at MHS MHS began its educational history with only 18 male students and was opened for admission to all students in the then, Malaya. In 1826, MHS was opened for girl students admission for the first time, when 65 girls were registered. However, in 1834, the admission of girl students had to be halted when its lady teacher Miss Wallaca (who replaced prior lady teacher, Maria Newell), left the school for Canton, China. Since then, the school had closed the girl students admission due to lack of teaching staff. Most of the students originated from Malacca Town and its surrounding areas such as Klebang, Limbongan, Bukit Rambai, Ujong Pasir, Masjid Tanah, Alor Gajah and other Malacca state districts. Since its establishment until World War II, it had less than 500 annual student intake, except in the year 1907 when the students population reached 505. The school expanded after the war. Today, MHS has an average annual enrolment of 2000 students.  Hostels  The hostel of MHS were built in 1924 and the Principal was Mr. C.G. Coleman. It could only accommodate 60 students. In 1972, the Ministry of Education, Malaysia; introduced the Special Student's Programme (Pelajar Rancangan Khas). In this programme, primary school students in Malacca who achieved good results in the Standard Five Evaluation Test (Penilaian Darjah Lima) were then placed/enrolled for secondary school education in MHS. There were then, 80 students involved in this programme during its implementation. In 1975, the old hostel which were located at the school main entrance was later demolished to make way for the construction of the school's new main assembly hall. A new 3-storey student hostel was then built at the back of the school compound and later named Special Programme Hostel (Asrama Rancangan Khas). The hostel had then accommodate the population of 118 students. Another hostel building was later built in 1983. During this time, MHS students hostel had been accommodating approximately 300 students. Hostel facilities includes a Muslim Mosque, a common living/activity room, a clinic, an air-conditioned library, an AV room, a cyber cafe, a dining hall and a VIP hall. The hostel was earlier named as MHS Boys' Hostel (Asrama Putera Sekolah Tinggi Melaka) in 1985 but was then renamed as Tan Sri Datuk Wira Abdul Rahman Arshad Hostel. It was renamed after the former Director General of Education, Malaysia; who was an MHS student from 1948 until 1956.  School field  From 1975 to 1979, a school field expansion project was undertaken by the Public Works Department (Jabatan Kerja Raya) to an area covering about . This expansion had made the school field famous throughout the state as the largest school field in Malacca. It has two football/rugby fields, running/sports track, an indoor hockey turf, a basketball court and a tennis court.  Main Assembly Hall  In 1974, the school Main Assembly Hall project was approved by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia. Unfortunately it was cancelled shortly after, due to the unexpected increments of the project cost causing shortages on government allocated project fund. However the school administration had later succeed in their appeal to the related government authorities to approve/allow the school to initiate its own fund raising activities in an effort to cover the said project cost amount differences. A need for a large assembly hall was so critical then; to accommodate the rapid increasing number of students hence project cancellation is not an option. With the initiative taken by the school's Board of Governors, teachers and the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), the school organised an official \\"Walkathon\\" Fund Raising programme on September 1977 to collect donations from the public. From the donations, the PTA, the Board of Governors as well as Malacca High School Old Pupils' Association (MAHSOPA), launched the Malacca High School Hall Building Fund. MAHSOPA raised RM 180,000.00 for the school hall building fund which amounted to 25% of the construction costs. The halted construction then continued. The school hall was later successfully built, commissioned and handed over to the school administration and was officially opened by the former Governor of Malacca, Tun Syed Zahiruddin bin Syed Hassan Al - Haj on 7 March 1981. The obvious sports facilities then were its four badminton courts. In 2017, the hall was renovated by the Ministry of Education at RM 500,000.00. MAHSOPA contributed RM 15,900.00 in 2018 to the school in buying a new PA system for the newly renovated school hall.  Mosque  The school mosque project was initiated in 1982, after the completion of the school hall. The former PTA chairman, Datuk Idris Abdul Ghani, with the help of other committee members, Muslim parents, teachers and students, as well as the public had contributed towards the mosque project. With the addition of funds from the School Development Fund, the mosque was completed in October 1984.  Later development  Projects include the renovation of the Drawing Room into Professional Room (1988), the building of the Wawasan and Budi block, the school gateway arch (1995), partial area of the school library renovated into Staff Room B (1998), the building of the Pintar Block (2000), the additional building of the students canteen, the Podium (Astaka) at the school field, the repair works on the west wing on the Warisan block which was damaged in a fire disaster in June 2000, as well as a two-storey computer lab on the former volleyball and basketball court. The school library also had its roof collapse in 2010 causing repairs to be done on the entire block including the teacher's room and library.  School mottos = Meliora Hic Sequamur  This old main motto stands for \\"Here We Strive For Better Things\\". The motto was introduced by the Principal of Malacca High School Mr. L.W. Arnold. He was stationed in the school from 1931 to 1934. The use of the motto coincided with the shifting of the school from the High Court Building to the current location. The official opening of the school was in October 1931.  Sini Terdidiknya Manusia  A direct translation of this would be: Here's Where Humans Well Educated. This motto was introduced in line with the government's efforts to promote the usage of Bahasa Malaysia among the people by the former principal, Tuan Haji Abdul Rafie bin Mahat in 1989.  We Are The Best  This motto was introduced by a former Principal, Tuan Haji Mohammad bin Ismail in 1991.  Mesra, Hormat, Sayang  A literal translation of this would be: Congeniality, Respect and Love. This motto was introduced by a former Principal, Tuan Haji Noh bin Haji Ahmad in 2001.  High School Cemerlang, Pelajar Terbilang  A direct translation of this would be: (Malacca) High School Excels, Students Distinct. This motto was introduced by the Principal, Tuan Haji Abdul Razak bin Che Ngah. School emblem The school emblem was introduced in 1931. During this time the School Board of Governors was established and the motto \\"Meliora Hic Sequamur\\" was established. Originally, the school emblem reflected ‘History,’Resilience’ and ‘Strength’. The ‘A Famosa’ logo was used and the colour of green and maroon were used. At the bottom of the logo, ‘ Meliora Hic Sequamur‘ was etched.

This bond is an extension of the more familiar types double bonds and triple bonds. Stable quadruple bonds are most common among the transition metals in the middle of the d-block, such as rhenium, tungsten, technetium, molybdenum and chromium. Typically the ligands that support quadruple bonds are π-donors, not π-acceptors. The structure of chromium(II) acetate History Chromium(II) acetate, Cr2(μ-O2CCH3)4(H2O)2, was the first chemical compound containing a quadruple bond to be synthesized. It was described in 1844 by E. Peligot, although its distinctive bonding was not recognized for more than a century. The first crystallographic study of a compound with a quadruple bond was provided by Soviet chemists for salts of .Kuznetsov, V. G.; Koz'min, P. A. \\"The structure of (pyH)HReCl4\\" Zhurnal Strukturnoi Khimii 1963, 4, 55-62. The very short Re–Re distance was noted. This short distance (and the salt's diamagnetism) indicated Re–Re bonding. These researchers however misformulated the anion as a derivative of Re(II), i.e., . Soon thereafter, F. Albert Cotton and C.B. Harris reported the crystal structure of potassium octachlorodirhenate or K2[Re2Cl8]·2H2O. This structural analysis indicated that the previous characterization was mistaken. Cotton and Harris formulated a molecular orbital rationale for the bonding that explicitly indicated a quadruple bond. The rhenium–rhenium bond length in this compound is only 224 pm. In molecular orbital theory, the bonding is described as σ2π4δ2 with one sigma bond, two pi bonds and one delta bond. Structure and bonding The octachlorodirhenate(III) anion, [Re2Cl8]2−, which features a quadruple Re–Re bond Formation of a delta bond by the overlap of two d orbitals The [Re2Cl8]2− ion adopts an eclipsed conformation as shown at left. The delta bonding orbital is then formed by overlap of the d orbitals on each rhenium atom, which are perpendicular to the Re–Re axis and lie in between the Re–Cl bonds. The d orbitals directed along the Re–Cl bonds are stabilized by interaction with chlorine ligand orbitals and do not contribute to Re–Re bonding. In contrast, the [Os2Cl8]2− ion with two more electrons (σ2π4δ2δ*2) has an Os–Os triple bond and a staggered geometry. Many other compounds with quadruple bonds between transition metal atoms have been described, often by Cotton and his coworkers. Isoelectronic with the dirhenium compound is the salt K4[Mo2Cl8] (potassium octachlorodimolybdate). An example of a ditungsten compound with a quadruple bond is ditungsten tetra(hpp). Quadruple bonds between atoms of main group elements are unknown. Molecular orbital theory shows that there are two sets of paired electrons in the sigma system (one bonding, one antibonding), and two sets of paired electrons in a degenerate π-bonding set of orbitals. This adds up to give a bond order of 2, meaning that there exists a double bond between the two carbons in a dicarbon (C2) molecule. The molecular orbital diagram of diatomic carbon would show that there are two pi bonds and no sigma bonds. However, a recent paper by S. Shaik et al. has suggested that a quadruple bond exists in diatomic carbon.

It forms part of the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality, the municipality governing Cape Town and its greater metropolitan area. Named after the species of Euphorbiaceae bushes which grow on the dunes and give off a milky latex like substance, it is commonly referred to simply as Melkbos. The town and its 7 kilometre stretch of white sand beach is situated on the Atlantic coast with the Blouberg mountain to the east. The beach is popular with surfers. It is one of the landing points for the South Africa-Far East and South Atlantic/West Africa submarine cable systems. Melkbosstrand is along the Blaauwberg region of the City of Cape Town within which it became incorporated when metropolitan boundaries were redrawn, following the advent of democracy in 1994. Its nearest neighbouring towns are Bloubergstrand to the south and Atlantis to the north-east. Melkbos is protected from urban development owing to its location in an expansive nature conservation zone to the South, insulating it from the Bloubergstrand sprawl, and the security buffer zones of Koeberg nuclear power station to the North and today it remains a pristine seaside resort. History Melkbosstrand (previously known as Losperd's Bay) (meaning, in old Dutch: the Bay of Lost Horses) is the site of the Battle of Blaauwberg (1806) whereby the Cape ceased to be occupied by French-Batavian troops and became a Colony of the British Crown.Military History Journal (South African Military History Society) Vol 13 No 4 - Dec 2005 The French had occupied the Cape from 1781-1783, after a fleet under the flag of celebrated admiral Bailli de Suffren anchored just north of Melkbosstrand.Andrew Smith, The French Period at the Cape, 1781-1783, Military History Journal Vol 5 No 3, June 1981 A cannon set on Melkbosstrand foreshore commemorates the battle itself. Numerous shipwrecks, some dating back to the Portuguese Discoverers of the Early Renaissance, are strewn along the coast of Melkbosstrand.See Lawrence G. Green, the great raconteur of the Cape: So Few Are Free, Cape Town: Howard B. Timmins, 1946, I, 4. Ancient Khoi-San middens and stone-age archeological findings have provided research with numerous artifacts.Alan G. Morris, \\"Trauma and Violence in the Later Stone Age in Southern Africa\\", June 2012, Vol. 102, No. 6 SAMJ In terms of Colonial, Dutch vernacular architecture, the area boasts several fine examples. The farmhouse Melkbosch, the first established by the Dutch East India Company outside Cape Town, is still extant albeit in a rather poor condition following a fire. On Melkbos bay itself, much favored by the surfing community for its good swell and warmer currents, stands the Damhuis cottage (now a beach restaurant), a late 18th-century fisherman house and the last one of its kind in the area (apart from Ons Huisie, at Blouberg Beach, some five kilometres away). In 1961, Melkbosstrand became the end point for the SAT-1 Copper cable between South Africa and Sesimbra, Portugal. In 1992, the cable was replaced by the SAT-2 fiber optic cable. Today, Melkbosstrand is still the landing point for the SAT-3/WASS undersea cable system. It owes much of its present-day infrastructure to two significant South African apartheid government developments in the late seventies. The first, Koeberg nuclear power station, constructed with the help of the British and French some 6 km north of Melkbosstrand, necessitated the creation of high quality housing for the foreign contractors. The second, the government subsidised creation of Atlantis Diesel Engines (ADE), a joint venture between the British Perkins- Elmer and German Daimler AG brands, to bypass international sanctions imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 418. Although ADE was in the industrial park of Atlantis, some 50 km north of Cape Town, subsidised housing was established in Melkbosstrand to help attract and retain the many German, British, and even South African, engineers, managers, and technicians. These houses, both for Koeberg and ADE, have long since been sold off to the public and form an interesting housing development with paved lanes, quaint housing, a club and a library, not un-reminiscent of the famed British series The Prisoner. Melkbos features in Deon Meyer's best-selling crime novel 7 Days (7 Dae in Afrikaans original) (2012) as the place where mad sniper, cop-killer, Solomon buys spray paint for camouflage. Economy, culture and sport For many years Melkbosstrand has been called the \\"rich man's town\\" by its neighbouring suburbs and towns, such as Atlantis and Table View. This labelling remark is probably because Melkbosstrand is home to a host of South African celebrities (retired rugby players, actors, writers, visiting members of the House of Lords), which is mainly due to its location and its views of Table Mountain. International best-selling novelist Deon Meyer was a long time resident of Melkbosstrand as well as South-African French philosopher Philippe-Joseph Salazar. Wild life on Melkbos beaches has always been abundant: \\"The most unusual scene,\\" writes Lawrence G. Green in South African Beachcomber,Lawrence G. Green, South African Beachcomber, Cape Town, Howard Timmins, 1958, p. 11. \\" came about when greedy seals chased thousands upon thousands of marsbankers into rocky pools on the coast to the north of Melkbosch Strand. Everyone in that village turned out with baskets, caught the fish by the hundred and carried them home alive\\". Crayfish or Cape lobster is plentiful although fishing is strictly regulated. Fish braais (barbecues) remain a favourite pastime among locals.

The concept of interstitiality The word interstitial means \\"between spaces\\", and is commonly used to denote \\"in-betweenness\\" in several different cultural contexts. Architects refer to the leftover gaps between building walls as \\"interstitial space\\", being neither inside any room nor outside the building. Medical doctors have used the term for hundreds of years to refer to a space within the human body that lies in between blood vessels and organs, or in between individual cells. Television station programmers refer to any short piece of content that is neither a show nor a commercial, but is sandwiched between them, as \\"an interstitial\\". How art can be interstitial Take fiction as an example: If a librarian isn't sure where to shelve a book, that may be because the material is interstitial in some way, not fitting comfortably into a single, conventional literary category. For instance, when novelist Laurell K. Hamilton first began writing and publishing romances featuring vampires and fairies, bookstores faced a dilemma: How do you file these stories when you're working in a system that clearly labels one shelf for romances, a second shelf for fantasies, and a third shelf for tales of horror? There's no single, obvious answer, because such a novel is interstitial fiction, its essence residing somewhere in between the boundaries of these genres. Or consider the performance artist Laurie Anderson: She might go onstage and sing, tell a spoken-word story, project shadow puppets on a screen, and play a hacked violin whose bow is strung with audio tape. Is she a singer, a monologist, a puppeteer, or some kind of tinkering instrumentalist? Classifying such an act as interstitial performance art would be imprecise but efficient and accurate. The interstitial arts movement In the mid-1990s, Delia Sherman, Ellen Kushner, Terri Windling, Heinz Insu Fenkl, Midori Snyder, Kelly Link, Gavin Grant, Gregory Frost, Theodora Goss, Veronica Schanoes, Carolyn Dunn, Colson Whitehead, and other American writers interested in fantastic literature found themselves commiserating over the common perception that the genre-oriented publishing industry found it difficult to market truly innovative fiction involving unusual, fantastical, or cross-genre elements—because the mainstream literary fiction field demanded stories based in realism, while the fantasy field demanded stories that mostly followed the standard conventions of sword and sorcery or high fantasy. Yet it seemed to the authors that some of the best literature was that which didn't quite fit tidily into either category but instead was being discussed in terms of more amorphous, \\"in-between\\" descriptors such as \\"magic realism\\", \\"mythic fiction\\", or \\"the New Weird\\". Further, the idea of interstitiality applied to other kinds of \\"in-between\\" fiction (unrelated to fantasy) and other \\"in-between\\" arts. Over a period of several years, Kushner and Sherman prompted ongoing discussion about the importance of cultivating artistic \\"in-betweenness\\" led to the formulation of the broad concept of interstitial art. In 2002, literary scholar Heinz Insu Fenkl founded ISIS: The Interstitial Studies Institute at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and in 2003–04, Sherman & Kushner and some of their colleagues established the Interstitial Arts Foundation, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to developing community and support for artists, arts-industry professionals and audiences whose creative pursuits are interstitial in nature. Interstitial Arts Projects= Interfictions  In 2007, the Interstitial Arts Foundation published an anthology of interstitial fiction through Small Beer Press titled Interfictions. It features 19 stories from new and established writers in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, and fiction translated from Spanish, Hungarian, and French. The anthology strives to \\"change your mind about what stories can and should do as they explore the imaginative space between conventional genres\\". The anthology raised several questions and started many debates on the nature of interstitiality as applied to fiction. Reviewers raised the question of how important the definition, or lack thereof, was to understanding the anthology as a whole and the stories individually. \\"The 19 stories contained within Interfictions serve as examples but not as points of an argument that could lead to a listing in a Funk and Wagnalls.\\" Though many of the stories are written by science fiction, fantasy, and horror writers and contain fantastic or supernatural elements, Interfictions is not a genre anthology. \\"...interstitial fiction mixes and matches these precepts—ghost stories, science fiction, nursery rhymes, detective story, whatever may be handy—as part of a variegated prism to focus on the psychology of existence even while bending its collectively recognized state. ...each 'interfiction' shares this sense of disjointed narrative, but in very different ways that do not lend themselves to easy genre categorization.\\" =Table of Contents= * Heinz Insu Fenkl, Introduction * Karen Jordan Allen, \\"Alternate Anxieties\\" * Christopher Barzak, \\"What We Know About the Lost Families of ---- House\\" * K.

Early years  Owner George Guthrie enlisted the firm of Lawrence and Holford to design the theatre in a Tudor Gothic style meant to resemble the castle in the city of Elsinore from Shakespeare's play Hamlet. Ellis F. Lawrence, the first dean of the University of Oregon school of architecture, was the project's principal architect. The building features stained glass by the Povey Brothers and a Mighty Wurlitzer theatre organ similar to the original, which was dismantled in 1962. Originally the Elsinore was designed for live performances and silent films. Three years after its construction in 1926, Guthrie leased the theatre to Fox West Coast Theatres. It was at this time that sound movies came to the theatre. One year after the lease to Fox Theaters, Guthrie leased it out to a different theater company, Warner Brothers Theaters which ran it as a movie theater until 1951.  Decline and restoration  Interior of the Elsinore In 1954, the theater began a general decline from its once great status in Salem into a second-run movie theater. In 1980, the Elsinore was set to be demolished. A grassroots effort known as the Save the Elsinore Committee did not want to let this historical treasure be demolished, and so began to work hard with local authorities to save the theater. While the theater was eventually saved from demolition, the committee was unable to effect any other major changes, as the two ballot measures pertaining to the theater, one for its purchase and restoration, and another for long term operating funds, were defeated in 1981. During the 1980s, the Save the Elsinore Committee obtained the consent of the owner to use the theater for 18 days of the year for free community events in order to spark public interest about the theater and its fate. The free events drew attendance of over 75,000 people. Until 1987, the theater was one of only three active movie theaters in downtown Salem (the others being the Capitol Theater just around the corner and an arthouse theater). Many of its customers came from Willamette University, drawn both by low admission prices and by the fact that the Elsinore was only two blocks off campus. In 1987, the Moyer family opened a new 7-screen movie theater several blocks away and converted an older multiplex theater elsewhere in Salem to a second-run movie house, effectively ending the Elsinore's life as a commercial movie theater. In approximately 1989, the theater was sold to Act III Theatres in conjunction with several other local movie theaters in the possession of Tom Moyer, who was the owner at the time. ACT III continued to allow the community to have limited use of the theater. ACT III did not have any interest in a 60-year-old movie theater however, and thus put it up for sale in 1990. The Save the Elsinore Committee jumped at the chance to gain ownership of the theater and launched a fundraising drive to purchase it. The funds were raised, and the theater was purchased. It continued to raise money for its operational costs through fundraising in the community and was graced by appearances from many stars at the turn of the millennium, most notably by actors James Earl Jones and Gregory Peck. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Finally, in February 2002, a deal was cut with Curry Brandaw, the architectural firm also responsible for Salem's Riverfront Carousel, to help restore the Elsinore completely at an estimated cost of $3.2 million. Over the next three summers, massive restoration undertakings were set in motion to restore the theater to its former grandeur. The project was completed in the summer of 2004, and the theater celebrated its 80th anniversary in May 2006.

The second book in the saga of Watches, it is preceded by Night Watch and followed by Twilight Watch, Last Watch, New Watch, and Sixth Watch. Day Watch also stands out of the saga as the only novel in the series not narrated mainly from Anton Gorodetsky's point of view. While the 2006 film Day Watch bears the same name, it is actually a loose adaptation of the second half of the first book in the series, Night Watch, and not an adaptation of this novel. The English translation by Andrew Bromfield was released in January 2007 both in the US and the UK. (UK Hardback, published by William Heinemann, with 320 pages) (UK Paperback, published by William Heinemann) At Amazon (USA Paperback, published by Miramax) At Amazon Plot summary Walking the streets of Moscow, indistinguishable from the rest of its population, are The Others. These beings possess supernatural powers and can enter the Twilight, a shadowy world that exists in parallel to our own. Each Other owes allegiance to either the Dark or the Light forces. Each side has a patrol to ensure the opposing side follows the rules of an agreement put in place millennia ago. The Light's patrol is called Night Watch and the Dark's patrol is called Day Watch, in accordance with the times when each is active. Unauthorised Personnel Permitted (this story is told from the point of view of Alisa Donnikova) In the prologue, a woman named Natasha visits a witch and requests that she cast a spell to make the woman's estranged husband fall in love with her again. After Natasha strikes a deal with the witch, members of the Night Watch suddenly arrive and arrest the witch, to Natasha's great surprise and confusion. The story shifts to Alisa Donnikova, a young yet powerful Dark Other, who leaves her house to attend a meeting with her comrades on the Day Watch. The team is on a mission to apprehend and recruit an uninitiated Other, the practicing Dark witch from the prologue who has so far eluded the bureaus responsible for finding and initiating unlicensed practitioners of magic. It seems a routine operation, but when they arrive, the Night Watch team has already made the arrest. A fierce battle ensues, during which Alisa almost dies. Drained of her powers, she is sent to recuperate at a youth camp near the Black Sea. There she meets Igor. The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and Alisa finds herself falling in love. But then comes a shattering revelation: Igor is a Light Magician. Alisa suddenly realizes that he was one of those involved in the battle that left her crippled. Had they known what they were, they would have not entered their relationship. But now that they know, Igor (who reacts with rage, feeling he was tricked) challenges Alisa (who reacts with a more depressed note of sadness) to a duel. Alisa allows Igor to choose the site of the battle: off-shore, in the sea. Alisa chooses not to fight back, allowing Igor to magically push her under the water and drown her. She calls Zabulon for help but is shocked to find out Zabulon has planned her death all along. While this is going on, Makar, a boy that had become infatuated with Alisa, swims out to rescue her and also drowns. Note: The first scene of this story forms the basis for the opening of the film Night Watch. In the movie, it is Anton (not Natasha) who goes to the witch. Rather than asking that his spouse fall back in love, he asks her to cast a spell that would kill his wife's love child with her adulterous lover (he later learns that the child was actually his own). Both scenes play out in much the same way from there, but the arrival of the Day Watch and subsequent battle do not take place in the movie. A Stranger Among Others (this story is told from the point of view of Vitaly Rogoza) A man named Vitaly Rogoza awakens while walking through a park late at night with no memory of his past and no knowledge of his identity. Acting on an internal instinct whose source he cannot understand, he is able to protect himself from a werewolf and board a train to Moscow. Once in Moscow and still acting on instinct, he registers his presence as a Dark Other with the Day Watch and proceeds to stumble into a series of seemingly accidental encounters with the Night Watch, often resulting in a Night Watch member dying. He kills Tiger Cub in self-defense as she seeks revenge for him setting a trap that (legally) kills a Night Watch investigator trespassing in his hotel room. While this is taking place, a Day Watch splinter group named the \\"Regin Brothers\\" stages an attack on the Inquisition to steal a powerful artifact named \\"Fafnir's Talon\\". Only four Regin Brothers survive and they head to Moscow. Members of the Night Watch and the Day Watch both learn that the Regin Brothers will be landing in a plane at Moscow International Airport. At the airport, both groups set up camp; the Night Watch tries to thwart the plane's landing while the Day Watch seeks to ensure it proceeds smoothly. Vitaly wanders away from the main group of Day Watch agents and inadvertently stumbles upon the Regin Brothers and two powerful Night Watch members, Gesar and Svetlana. Gesar kills one of the Regin Brothers who attempts to flee, but Vitaly accidentally winds up in possession of the talon. He steals power from Svetlana and creates a portal that allows him to escape to a forest outside Moscow. After meeting some youths camping in the forest, Vitaly returns to Moscow. Instead of returning to the Day Watch offices with the talon, however, his instincts lead him to Maxim from the first novel, who is now a member of the Inquisition. At Maxim's behest, Vitaly relinquishes the talon. Soon thereafter, the Inquisition calls a meeting to determine what is happening and who should be held responsible. Anton is called to attend, but Zabulon encourages him to commit a small act of \\"betrayal\\" by not going, with the promise that he will be able to live freely with Svetlana and avoid bloodshed. After Vitaly and Anton have a car accident (deliberately staged by Anton) on the way to the meeting, Svetlana concludes that Anton and Vitaly are engaged in a duel that will result in Anton's death. When Vitaly arrives before Anton at the meeting alone, she assumes the worst and strikes him with all of her considerable power, leaving her dangerously drained (like Alisa above). Vitaly absorbs Svetlana's power, although his clothes and MiniDisc player are destroyed. Anton then appears and gives Vitaly his own MiniDisc player as a replacement. The Inquisition concludes that Vitaly is a mirror and not an Other in the ordinary sense; thus he does not come under the terms of the Treaty and is free to pursue his own destiny. Vitaly was able to neutralize Svetlana by his presence and restore the balance between the Night Watch and Day Watch. Svetlana is sufficiently reduced in power, so that she and Anton are now theoretically able to live as equals, as Zabulon promised. Vitaly leaves the courthouse, listening to music, and dissipates into the Twilight, his purpose fulfilled. Another Power (this story is told in third- person, though the action continually switches its focus between the first novel's narrator, Anton, and a second-level Dark Other, Edgar) The third story revolves around a trial by the Inquisition to investigate the events of the first two stories. The first part of the story deals with various involved parties travelling to Prague (where the trial will be held), the second part involves the characters meeting in a number of different configurations and talking, the third part involves the trial itself. All of the surviving major characters of the first two stories are on their way to Prague, which is the new location of the Inquisition after the Regin Brothers destroyed the old one. Edgar, a fairly high level operative, is going to plead the Day Watch's case. Edgar assures the 3 remaining Regin Brothers that the Day Watch will protect them. Anton is going as a prosecutor for the Night Watch. Igor is already there being put up (but not held in custody) by the Inquisition. In Prague, Anton meets an American Air Force pilot who is also a Light Mage. The pilot is proud of his work (bombing Kosovo). Anton is appalled that anyone can perform such evil acts and still align themselves with the Light. Anton and Edgar meet over beer and discuss Dark versus Light philosophy. Edgar shows that he is not an especially enthusiastic Dark Other, but he is dedicated to doing his job. Anton then goes to visit Igor while Edgar, left to his own devices, uncovers a lot of evidence to indicate that Zabulon is setting him up to be killed in order to facilitate the resurrection of Fafnir. He is frightened and angered by this prospect. Meanwhile, Anton, eager to distract the suicidal Igor, gets him roaring drunk on Vodka and attempts to draw him into a strategy session to try to figure out what the Day Watch is up to, with some success. They wonder whose destiny it was that Olga changed at the end of Night Watch and here it is revealed that, though Svetlana's child—foretold by Gesar to be a girl—would have always been a powerful Light Other, the changes mean that her birth has been timed to make her daughter a Light Messiah. Gesar arrives and pleads with Igor to stick around for at least another 20 years. Igor is non-committal. The next day, the trial begins. The Regin Brothers are tried first and are found guilty only of lesser crimes: though they transported Fafnir's Talon, they did not participate in its theft. They are stripped of all but the very least of their magical powers and then allowed to go. The focus of the trial then shifts to the events of the novel's first story. A number of minor charges against Gesar and Zabulon are dismissed via technicalities. Anton accuses Zabulon of indirectly arranging the duel between Igor and Alisa and blames Zabulon for the death of Makar, the young boy who drowned trying to save Alisa. Edgar and Zabulon challenge the Night Watch operatives to present proof, but neither Anton nor Igor can do so. In order to get to the bottom of the case, the Inquisition temporarily resurrects Alisa, who implicates Zabulon in her demise, stating that Igor was not responsible for her death. Igor is cleared of all charges. However, when Alisa is sent back to the Twilight, Igor follows her, dying himself. Zabulon is ecstatic, admitting that he had indeed planned to sacrifice Alisa in order to remove Igor, saying that Igor was the only one that could have trained the upcoming Light Messiah. Since Zabulon's plan involved an even trade—Alisa for Igor—he has not violated the treaty, and the Inquisition clears him of charges. As Svetlana leaves, she tells Zabulon, \\"May no one ever love you.\\" Gesar sends Anton to find her, while the rest of the individuals at the trial depart the scene. Edgar approaches a member of the Inquisition, Witezslav, who invites Edgar to \\"try on\\" an Inquisitor's robe. Edgar reluctantly takes the robe from Witezslav while mentioning that Svetlana's \\"curse\\" is pointless because Zabulon doesn't need anyone to love him anyway. Note: This story is the only one in the hexalogy without a first-person narrator.  Characters = Light Others  *Anton Gorodetsky (Light Mage) - a reluctant member of Night Watch, in the beginning of the first book, preferred mundane, technical jobs to actual field work. The events of the series forced him to step up and become a full-fledged operative. They also made him considerably more cynical about the cause of Light Others. His favorite pastime is listening to randomly arranged custom mini-discs. During the course of the novel, he and Svetlana relationship becomes rocky but the novel ends with the knowledge that Anton will be the father of Svetlana's child. *Boris Ignatievich/Gesar (Grand Light Mage) - an ancient mage of Tibetan descent who taught a number of heroes and philosophers during his lifetime. He moved to Europe during the early 15th century. Although he has had many opportunities to advance to high-level posts within Night Watch, he chose to remain a regional director of the Moscow division. Gesar is a battle-hardened tactician who's been known to turn devastating defeats into small victories. He cares a great deal about his subordinates, though he doesn't hesitate to put them in harm's way for the sake of greater good. *Svetlana (Grand Light Sorceress) - a young doctor who became a Great Light Enchatress. She is destined to be a mother of the Light Messiah. Her powers were severely drained by the Mirror. *Olga (Grand Light Sorceress) - an old friend and an occasional lover of Gesar who was turned into an owl for breaking obligations she had to the light side. Prior to the events of Day Watch, that punishment was lifted and she was restored to full power. She also wrote in the book of destiny in order to affect the date of the Light Messiah's birth indirectly (since changing the destiny of an Other directly is very difficult). *Semyon (Light Mage) - a crusty, experienced mage with a wryly cynical outlook on the world. Unlike many of his fellow mages, he is a capable fighter even without his magic. *Tiger Cub/Katya (Shifter-Mage) - a young, playful mage with a penchant for jewels and amulets. She is highly regarded both by Dark and Light Others. It has been said that she could charm anyone. As the name implies, tiger is her animal form. She has a large house riddled with secret passages. While fighting with the mirror, Vitaly, she was crushed and killed by one of his spells. *Bear (Shifter-Mage) - a reclusive, quiet mage known for his calculated, brutal tactics. It has been continuously speculated that he was originally a Dark Other, despite the well-known fact that once the choice is made, the Others can't change sides. His animal form is a large polar bear. He is frequently partnered with Tiger Cub and is greatly saddened with her demise. *Ignat (Light Incubus/Succubus) - a self- absorbed mage with \\"[the] face of a Hollywood actor and [the] body of a Greek god\\". He prides himself on being able to bed any woman (or man, he doesn't care). As a result, he takes failure very hard. *Garik (Light Mage) - a shy mage infamous for his bad luck with women. *Alisher (Light Mage) - a weak magician born from a devona father and a human mother. Alisher's father was killed by Alisa Donnikova in the first book. Afterward he became Gesar's new apprentice. It was suggested that he might play an unknown role in Gesar's plan. *Igor Teplov (Light Mage) - an idealistic mid-level mage. Despite his youthful appearance, he was born in the late 1920s. He is dedicated to the cause of Light Others, though his refusal to compromise his principles has occasionally caused problems. He was drained of his powers during a battle again the Dark Others and sent to a camp at the Black Sea to recuperate. He fell in love with Alisa while she too was recovering from a power drain, while both were unable to recognize each other as Others. Upon discovering Alisa was a Dark Other, he took it badly and challenged her, which led to her death as she didn't fight back. A year later, during the Fafnir incident, he willingly banished (\\"dematerialized\\") himself into the Twilight in order to be with Alisa, much to Gesar's chagrin.  Dark Others  *Zavulon (spelled Zabulon in the English translation) (Grand Dark Mage) - an ancient schemer about the same age as Gesar. His true form has taken on demonic characteristics because he had spent a great deal of time in the Twilight. He expressed interest in taking Alisa back, so long as she did what she was told (only to reveal that he was just using Alisa as part of his plan). He knew Lewis Carroll. *Alisa Donnikova (Dark Witch) - a young witch with the penchant for mischief and discreet mind manipulation. She was killed as a result of Zavulon's scheme to deprive the Light Messiah of the proper teacher. She was temporarily resurrected to testify during the Farnir affair. *Anna Lemesheva (Dark Witch) - a senior witch who used to be Zavulon's lover. She became jealous after Zavulon took a favour in Alisa. She was used as the vessel to rematerialize/resurrect Alisa temporarily. *Edgar (Dark Mage) - a strong dark mage (1-2 level) who was transferred to Moscow from an Estonian Day Watch on Zavulon's behest. Although he was, for a while, a steadfast supporter of the Dark Other's cause, he found many aspects of the Dark Others' lifestyle distasteful. After getting tired of Zavulon's schemes, he joins the Inquisition.  Unaffiliated  *Maxim (Inquisitor) - a middle-class Light Other whose powers emerged before Night Watch could find him. Feeling compelled to seek out evil, he hunted and killed low-level Dark Others with an enchanted wooden dagger. Upon discovering the truth about the Others, he joined the Inquisition. *Vitaly Ragoza (The Mirror) - a minor Other who was not associated with either side, but was turned into the Mirror by the Twilight itself in order to correct the imbalance between the Night Watch and Day Watch in Moscow. As the Mirror, he had an ability to match the power level of any Other he was combating at the time. In the span of two weeks, he killed Tiger Cub and drained Svetlana's power. Upon completing his mission, he vanished into the Twilight. *Witezslav (Inquisitor): a Higher Vampire Dark Other. Anton was shocked to learn that there was a Vampire among the Prague Inquisition. In Czech - Vítězslav. *Egor (Other) - a young and rare Other who was affiliated to neither Light nor Dark. It was suggested that he could become a Mirror like Vitaly.

It lies in the Maniototo, close to the former gold mining route of the Old Dunstan Road, 85 kilometres to the northwest of Dunedin city centre. It is classified as a regionally significant wetland. The swamp lies on the upper surface of the Rock and Pillar Range (the Rock and Pillars are a horst range, and thus have a very flat top). Originally an actual swamp, a dam to store water for irrigation and hydroelectricity has turned the 'swamp' into a lake. The swamp is drained by the Logan Burn, which feeds into the Taieri River at Paerau. The Loganburn Reservoir was finished in 1983, holding about 85 million cu m of water. In 2014 the dam was raised by 80 cm, through the addition of an 80 cm-high spillway, and increasing the height of the coping wall along the top of the dam. This increased the storage by some 11.5 million cu m. The dam is located on the southern end of the Rock and Pillar Range, about 12 km south of Paerau, providing irrigation for 60 farmers and 9,300ha, and power generation when water is released for irrigation.

It is made of polished jackwood, and the drumheads made of calfskin (preferably taken from 1-2 year old calf) are held together by leather braces which are also twined round the waist of the drum. This mechanism helps in adjusting the tension and controlling the sound, mainly two: 'tha' and 'thom'. It is one of the constituting instruments in Panchavadyam. It is also a major percussion instrument used in sree-bali, sree-bhootha-bali and related temple rites. A Panchavadyam performance is begun with Timila Pattu and ends with the Timila Idachal thus making timila a very important component of the traditional Kerala percussion ensemble.  Construction and mechanics  Thimila performance It has the shape of two cones kept in opposite direction i.e., an hour-glass like shape. The traditional size of thimila made of heart wood or fully grown jackwood (particularly varikka-plaavu) has a length of 24.k virals (one viral = 1.77 inches), 6 virals at ends and 2.5 virals at the centre, besides having a thickness of ¾ viral (finger). The tun is hollow. Of late, presumably for reducing the weight, the measurements are changed without much loss in symphony. According to the procedure of manufacture, the tun of thimila is made in jackwood in the shape described above. Then the sides are made independently using rings (known as valayal) made up from climbers known as vennil-valli or manja-valli. The circumference of the rings is slightly more than that of the ends of the tun. The refined leather taken from a calf (between 1–2 years of age) is properly cut and fixed to these rings with the help of gum (made up of raw rice). The fixing of leather has to be done tightly as it determines the symphony of thimila. Six holes of size 3/8 viral each is made on either side and they are fixed to the tun with the help of twined leather threads (total requirement of thread is 25 feet). The tension of strings is very important as it is closely linked with the symphony. For suspending the thimila at the shoulders of the drummer a long cloth of 9 feet length and at least 6 inches width is used. In every respect it is an excellent masterpiece of art as it produces charming sounds.  Masters of Timila  Among today's masters of timila are Kuzhoor Narayana Marar, Annamanada Parameswara Marar, Chandran Marar, Thrikkambaram Krishnankutty Marar, Karavattedath Narayana Marar, Koroth Ramakrishna Marar, Chottanikkara Vijayan, Parakkattu Thankappan, Nandappan, Ooramana Venu, Ooramana Rajan, Ooramana Aji, Kariyannur Narayanan Namboodiri, Kunissery Aniyan, Kongad Vijayan, Kongad Madhu,Vaikom Chandran, Payyannur Balakrishna Marar, Kariyannur Narayanan Namboodiri,pallashana murali marar, Keezhillam Gopalakrishnan ,Peruvanam Krishnakumar ....

The Bartoli indole synthesis The reaction is often unsuccessful without substitution ortho to the nitro group, with bulkier ortho substituents usually resulting in higher yields for the reaction. The steric bulk of the ortho group assists in the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement required for product formation. Three equivalents of the vinyl Grignard reagent are necessary for the reaction to achieve full conversion when performed on nitroarenes, and only two equivalents when performed on nitrosoarenes. This method has become one of the shortest and most flexible routes to 7-substituted indoles. The Leimgruber- Batcho indole synthesis gives similar flexibility and regiospecificity to indole derivatives. One advantage of the Bartoli indole synthesis is the ability to produce indoles substituted on both the carbocyclic ring and the pyrrole ring, which is difficult to do with the Leimgruber-Batcho indole synthesis. Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism of the Bartoli indole synthesis is illustrated below using o-nitrotoluene (1) and propenyl Grignard (2) to form 3,7-dimethylindole (13). The mechanism of the Bartoli indole synthesis The mechanism begins by the addition of the Grignard reagent (2) onto the nitroarene (1) to form intermediate 3. Intermediate 3 spontaneously decomposes to form a nitrosoarene (4) and a magnesium salt (5). (Upon reaction workup, the magnesium salt will liberate a carbonyl compound (6).) Reaction of the nitrosoarene (4) with a second equivalent of the Grignard reagent (2) forms intermediate 7. The steric bulk of the ortho group causes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement forming the intermediate 8. Cyclization and tautomerization give intermediate 10, which will react with a third equivalent of the Grignard reagent (2) to give a dimagnesium indole salt (12). Reaction workup eliminates water and gives the final desired indole (13). Therefore, three equivalents of the Grignard reagent are necessary, as one equivalent becomes carbonyl compound 6, one equivalent deprotonates 10 forming an alkene (11), and one equivalent gets incorporated into the indole ring. The nitroso intermediate (4) has been isolated from the reaction. Additionally, reaction of the nitroso intermediate (4) with two equivalents of the Grignard reagent produces the expected indole. The scope of the reaction includes substituted which can be used to make 4-azaindoles(left) and 6-azaindoles(right). Bartoli Indole Synth Scope Variations=Dobbs modification Adrian Dobbs greatly enhanced the scope of the Bartoli indole synthesis by using an ortho- bromine as a directing group, which is subsequently removed by AIBN and tributyltin hydride. The Dobbs modification of the Bartoli indole synthesis The synthesis of 4-methylindole (3) highlights the ability of this technique to produce highly substituted indoles.

Real estate listings on major websites such as Daum show measurements in square meters with the pyeong equivalent. Ping In Taiwan, the Taiwanese ping remains in fairly common use and is about 3.306m2. In mainland China, the metrification of traditional units would produce a ping of 4m2, but it is almost unknown with most real estate floorspace simply reckoned in square meters.

This temple is associated with the legend of Shiva saving his young devotee, Markendeya from death, and the tale of a saint, Abirami Pattar a devotee of the presiding goddess. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple complex covers 10 acres and has two gateway towers known as gopurams. The tallest is the eastern tower, with 11 stories and a height of . The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Amirthaghateswarar and Abhirami being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have appeared as Kalasamharamurthy to save Markandeya from the death clutches of Yama. Based on the legend of Markandeya, it is believed that worshiping at this temple will give longevity to couples who have reached age sixty or eighty-one and such worship is common in the temple. Brahmapureeswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur Mayanam or Brahmapureeswarar Temple Thirumeiganam, Pillaiperumalnallur, another famous Padal Petra Shiva Sthalam is located nearby, easterly. Legend Shiva saving Markendeya from Yama Thirukkadaiyur derives its name from the pot, called Gatam in Tamil. Vishnu, Indra, and the other Devas needed a sublime place to consume the ambrosia that had been churned during the Samudra manthan and, therefore, brought the ambrosia pot here. Before consuming it, they forgot to worship Ganesha, who is to be worshiped before any great undertaking. Ganesha, hurt and offended at the unintentional slight by the devas, stole the pot of Amrita and hid it at Tirukkadaiyur. Ganesha created a Shiva Lingam, dedicated to his father and mother, and poured some of the Amrita over it. The Shiva Lingam at this temple is known as Amrita Ghat Eshwarar, which, translated from Sanskrit literally means \\"Lord that leads to immortality\\" ('Immortality' (Amrita) 'Step' (Ghat) 'Lord' (Eshwarar)). It is also believed that Abhirami incarnated here by the power of Vishnu. As per popular legend, near the temple of Tirukkadaiyur, there lived a sage named Mrikandu and his wife Marudmati. They were both devotees of Shiva and worshiped him day and night for many years, asking to be graced with a child. After many years of penance, Shiva appeared to Mrikandu and Marudmati. He told them that he heard their prayers and would give them a choice: they could either have a gifted son who would live to be only sixteen, or a son of low intelligence who would live a long life. Mrikandu and Marudmati chose the former, and were blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of sixteen. As Markandeya grew, so did his devotion to Shiva. As advised by his father, Markandeya worshipped the Shiva Lingam at Tirukkadaiyur, even bringing water from the Ganges to the temple via an underground passage. On the day he was destined to die, Yama, the deity of death, appeared with his noose to tie around the soul of Markandeya and take it with him. Markandeya sought refuge in the temple and embraced the Siva Lingam. Shiva appeared and warned Yama not to touch Markandeya, as he was under his protection. Yama refused to listen and threw the noose anyway, binding Markandeya and the Lingam together. Angered by Yama's extraordinary arrogance, Shiva kicked him and held him under his foot, making Yama inactive. Markandeya was blessed by Shiva to remain sixteen years old eternally. Shiva came to be known as \\"Kala-samhara\\" (Sanskrit: \\"Destroyer of Time\\") at this temple. Meanwhile, with Yama being rendered inactive, there were no deaths on earth, but people were still being born. Burdened by the weight of so many people and unable to sustain their hunger, the earth-goddess, Bhumi Devi, appealed to Shiva for help. Shiva, feeling compassionate for the earth- goddess, released Yama, allowing death to occur again. However, in order to remind Yama never to try to kill someone while they are worshiping Shiva again, the icon of Shiva in this temple is depicted with his forefinger raised in warning. Since it is believed that Lord Siva subdued Yama in Thirukkadaiyur, the Lord is called Mrityunjaya (Sanskrit: \\"Conqueror of Death\\" or \\"Victorious over Death\\"). History There are several inscriptions in the temple belonging to the Medieval Cholas. On the southern wall in the central shrine, there is an inscription from the 13th regnal year of Rajaraja I indicating stipulation of paddy to the temple by a merchant in return to offer of land to the temple offered. Another record in the temple indicates the record (ARE 242 of 1925) of a gift of paddy to the temple by Rajendra Chola for conducting eight-day temple festival annually. A third record on the same wall indicates record dated to 1054 AD from the reign of Rajadhiraja Chola records a gift of land by a devotee to feed 17 devotees. The fourth record (ARE 244 of 1925) in the shrine from the period of Kulothunga Chola I indicates the Mahasabha of Tirukadavur selling 1.74 velis of land that had been lying fallow for 50 years. An interesting inscription from the outer precinct from the period of Rajaraja II indicates confiscation of lands from a custodian of a temple who colluded with Vaishanvites (worshipers of Vishnu). There are several inscriptions indicating donations for performing art, drama, dance and music. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Adheenam. Architecture thumb The temple, in line with the temple architecture of the Chola dynasty, occupies a very vast area of , with five courtyards, several imposing temple towers, and large and spacious mandapas. Though the details of the king who consecrated the temple are uncertain, it can be ascertained from inscriptions in the temple that it has been in existence since at least the tenth or eleventh century, during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I. It was during the period of Kulothunga Chola I (1075–1120) that the brick walls of the temple were replaced with stone walls and the mandapam in the front was constructed. The rajagopuram, or the front entryway of the temple, is replete with images made of mortar, depicting various legends associated with the temple. The temple occupies an area of and has around five large precincts. The temple faces West and is approached through a seven-tiered raja gopuram (pyramidal temple tower). The central shrine houses the image of Amrithakadeswarar in the form of Linga. There is a separate shrine for Kalasamharamurthy, the saviour of Markendeya near the sanctum. The bronze image is sported with four arms, emanating out of a Linga. The niches in the walls around the first precinct contains images of Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikesa. There are five set of stone sculptures belonging to the Chola temple. There are three temple tanks, or teerthams, known as Amrita Pushkarini, Kaala Theertham and Maarkandeya Theertham. There is a separate shrine dedicated to Abhirami. The Shakta saint Abhirami Pattar is believed to have rendered the Abhirami Anthathi in the front hall of the shrine. The temple also maintains a separate shrine for Markandeya worshipping Kalasamhara Murti. Although Thirukadaiyur is a Shaiva temple, it contains an old Vaishnava temple. The gods in this temple are Amrita Narayana (Vishnu) and his consort Amrita Valli (Lakshmi). The shrine of Abirami faces east and is located close to the entrance tower. The precinct houses the image of Abirami Pattar. Abhirami Pattar Legend of Abirami Pattar At this temple, towards the beginning of the sixteenth century, there lived a staunch devotee of the goddess Abhirami named Subramanian. He loved the goddess so much that he saw her everywhere and in everyone, but especially in all women. Any woman that entered the temple he would offer flowers to, worshiping her as the living embodiment of the goddess. One day, King Saraboji visited the temple as Subramanian was meditating on the glories of Abhirami. Seeing that Subramanian did not bow before him as he entered the temple, the king became irritated. He asked one of the devotees in the temple who this man was that refused to recognize him. One priest told the king that Subramanian was mad, worshiping all women as the Divine Mother and showering them with flowers. However, another priest of the temple overheard this and corrected the man, saying that Subramanian was truly a saint and a great devotee of Mother Abhirami. The king, confused by the two conflicting accounts of who this man was, decided to put Subramanian to the test. Therefore, he asked Subramanian whether today was a full moon day or a new moon day. At that time, Subramanian was still absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother, seeing her shining face in his mind. Subramanian, seeing the Goddess' face and mistaking it for the moon, responded to the king saying that it was a full moon day when it was actually a new moon day. The king, deciding that Subramanian must be mad, ordered that he be burnt at dusk if the moon failed to appear. After some time, the king's army awakened Subramanian and ordered him to come with them to be executed for his madness. On returning to ordinary consciousness, Subramanian realized that he had mistaken the face of the Divine Mother for the full moon, making him say it was a full moon day when, in actuality, it was a new moon day. Standing at the pyre, with the flames rising all around him, Subramanian realized that only the Divine Mother could save him now. He began singing a song of one- hundred praises to Abhirami (the so-called Abhirami Antati or \\"Song to Abhirami\\"), begging her to come to his rescue. While singing the seventy-ninth verse of his song, which states that the Divine Mother is an ocean of blessing without limit whose merciful eyes grant liberation, Mother Abhirami appeared before Subramanian, his executioners, and the unbelieving king. Throwing her earring into the sky, it took the form of the full moon. The king, having realized his mistake and immensely pleased by his devotion, released Subramanian. From that day forward, Subramanian was called Abhirami Bhattar, which translates to \\"priest of Abhirami\\", and the king became his disciple. To this day, Abhirami Bhattar is still celebrated at Thirukadaiyur on the new moon day in the Tamil month of Tai (mid-January to mid-February). Religious importance Among the sixty-three Shaiva poet-saints, collectively known as the Nayanars, Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar and Kari Nayanar both worshiped and attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death here. Kalaya Nayanar was an ardent worshiper of Shiva and lighted temple lamps & incense sticks with his meager earning. Once he had no earning and the family was facing severe poverty. Kalaya's wife gave his gold ornament to sell for daily expenditure. Kalaya sold the gold and used the money for lighting the temple lamps. As he lighted more and more lamps, his house was filled with grains. A divine voice detailed his affinity towards the presiding deity resulted in the wealth. He came to be known as Kungili Kalayanar (kungilium in Tamil means incense powder). The Nayanars Appar, Sundarar and Tirugnana Sambandar have also sung of the glories of this shrine. All Siddhas visited this temple. Specially Siddhar Korakkar visited this temple and got the blessings of the goddess. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. The eleven songs of Sambandar are compiled in third Thirumurai as 8th canto. The thirty one songs of Appar are compiled in the fourth Thirumrai ten each under 31st and 107th canto, while the remaining eleven in fifth Thirumrai under 11th canto. The ten songs of Sundarar are compiled in seventh Thirumurai in 28th cantor. As per legends, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andhakasura, Gajasura, Jalandhara, Thirupuradhi, Kama, Arjunan, Dakshan and Tarakasur. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury. The eight temples are Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Korukkai or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. Worship and festivals Worship of longevity The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 8:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Amritaghateswar and Abhirami Amman. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Based on the legend of Markandeya, it is believed that worshipping at this temple will give longevity to couples who have reached age sixty or eighty-one. A service called Sashtiaptha poorthi (Tamil: \\"completion of sixty [years]\\") is celebrated in honor of a husband's sixtieth birthday and Sadhabishegam (Sanskrit: \\"Eighty- One\\") is celebrated in honor of his eighty-first birthday. The annual Brahmotsavam is celebrated in the month of Chithirai (April–May) here. The Shankha-abhisheka, a festival of the Divine Mother celebrated in the month of Kartikai (November–December), is also of great importance here. Other festivals celebrated at this temple in honor of the Divine Mother include Navaratri and Aadi Pooram, a festival celebrating the day that Abhirami attained her menarche.

His mother, Blanche, was a department store buyer, and his father, Aloysius Mangold, worked at an organ factory. He first trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art from 1956-59, and then at Yale University, New Haven, (BFA, 1961; MFA, 1963).

Work  “Robert Mangold’s paintings,” wrote Michael Kimmelman in the New York Times in 1997, “are more complicated to describe than they seem, which is partly what’s good about them: the way they invite intense scrutiny, which, in the nature of good art, is its own reward.” His works are comprised often of simple elements which are put together through complex means. Mangold's work challenges the typical connotations of what a painting is or could be, and his works often appear as objects rather than images. Elements refer often to architectural elements or have the feeling of an architect's hands. He almost always works in extensive series, often carried through both paintings and works on paper.Robert Mangold: New Paintings & Works on Paper, The Ring series, September 9 - October 3, 2009 Lisson Gallery, London. Mangold’s early work consisted largely of monochromatic free-standing constructions displayed against the wall, such as Grey Window Wall (1964).Robert Mangold Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1968 he began employing acrylic instead of oil paint, rolling rather than spraying it on Masonite or plywood grounds. Within the year, he moved from these more industrially oriented supports to canvas.Robert Mangold Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. In 1970 he began working with shaped canvases and within the year began brushing rather than spraying paint onto canvas. By the mid-1970s, Mangold moved on to overlapping shapes whose contours are formed by combinations of canvas edges and both drawn and implied lines.Suzanne Muchnic (July 16, 1985), Mangold Show: The Shape Of Things Past Los Angeles Times. A Rectangle and a Circle within a Square from 1975, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of these subtle geometric relationships. A 1994 series consisted of monochrome panels, deployed in two-panel trapezoidal works whose colors, sometimes matching, sometimes contrasting, run to deep oranges, olive greens, browns and grays.Roberta Smith (April 8, 1994), Art in Review; Robert Mangold New York Times. In a 2006/7 series, entitled Column Structure I through Column Structure XII, the 12 canvases each have a central vertical trunk measuring 10 feet high and 2 feet wide that is subdivided by straight, horizontal lines and appended with squares or triangles that jut from the sides, usually near the top.Roberta Smith (March 2, 2007), Art in Review; Robert Mangold New York Times. Mangold’s paintings, quiet and restrained on the surface, are much admired by artists. In a 1994 review in Art in America, Robert Kushner wrote that “underneath the composure of their execution, there is an almost romantic vividness of experience. The contrast of this veiled undercurrent and the Apollonian restraint of the presentation make these new paintings both powerful and poignant.” Mangold made his first prints in 1972 at Crown Point Press and has made prints throughout his career, working with Pace Editions and Brooke Alexander Editions. Mangold designed the monumental colored glass panels contained in the Buffalo Federal Courthouse pavilion lobby. Mangold lives in Washingtonville, New York with his wife Sylvia Plimack Mangold, who is also an artist.

Demonstration of the languages which are used in the process of translating using a bridge language. Interlingual machine translation is one of the classic approaches to machine translation. In this approach, the source language, i.e. the text to be translated is transformed into an interlingua, i.e., an abstract language-independent representation. The target language is then generated from the interlingua. Within the rule-based machine translation paradigm, the interlingual approach is an alternative to the direct approach and the transfer approach. In the direct approach, words are translated directly without passing through an additional representation. In the transfer approach the source language is transformed into an abstract, less language- specific representation. Linguistic rules which are specific to the language pair then transform the source language representation into an abstract target language representation and from this the target sentence is generated. The interlingual approach to machine translation has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that it requires fewer components in order to relate each source language to each target language, it takes fewer components to add a new language, it supports paraphrases of the input in the original language, it allows both the analysers and generators to be written by monolingual system developers, and it handles languages that are very different from each other (e.g. English and ArabicAbdel Monem, A., Shaalan, K., Rafea, A., Baraka, H., Generating Arabic Text in Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Machine Translation Framework, Machine Translation, Springer, Netherlands, 20(4): 205–258, December 2008.). The obvious disadvantage is that the definition of an interlingua is difficult and maybe even impossible for a wider domain. The ideal context for interlingual machine translation is thus multilingual machine translation in a very specific domain. History The first ideas about interlingual machine translation appeared in the 17th century with Descartes and Leibniz, who came up with theories of how to create dictionaries using universal numerical codes. Others, such as Cave Beck, Athanasius Kircher and Johann Joachim Becher worked on developing an unambiguous universal language based on the principles of logic and iconographs. In 1668, John Wilkins described his interlingua in his \\"Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\\". In the 18th and 19th centuries many proposals for \\"universal\\" international languages were developed, the most well known being Esperanto. That said, applying the idea of a universal language to machine translation did not appear in any of the first significant approaches. Instead, work started on pairs of languages. However, during the 1950s and 60s, researchers in Cambridge headed by Margaret Masterman, in Leningrad headed by Nikolai Andreev and in Milan by Silvio Ceccato started work in this area. The idea was discussed extensively by the Israeli philosopher Yehoshua Bar-Hillel in 1969. During the 1970s, noteworthy research was done in Grenoble by researchers attempting to translate physics and mathematical texts from Russian to French, and in Texas a similar project (METAL) was ongoing for Russian to English. Early interlingual MT systems were also built at Stanford in the 1970s by Roger Schank and Yorick Wilks; the former became the basis of a commercial system for the transfer of funds, and the latter's code is preserved at The Computer Museum at Boston as the first interlingual machine translation system. In the 1980s, renewed relevance was given to interlingua- based, and knowledge-based approaches to machine translation in general, with much research going on in the field. The uniting factor in this research was that high-quality translation required abandoning the idea of requiring total comprehension of the text. Instead, the translation should be based on linguistic knowledge and the specific domain in which the system would be used. The most important research of this era was done in distributed language translation (DLT) in Utrecht, which worked with a modified version of Esperanto, and the Fujitsu system in Japan. Outline Figure 2. a) Translation graph required for direct or transfer-based machine translation (12 dictionaries are required); b) Translation graph required when using a bridge language (only 8 translation modules are required). In this method of translation, the interlingua can be thought of as a way of describing the analysis of a text written in a source language such that it is possible to convert its morphological, syntactic, semantic (and even pragmatic) characteristics, that is \\"meaning\\" into a target language. This interlingua is able to describe all of the characteristics of all of the languages which are to be translated, instead of simply translating from one language to another. Figure 3: Translation graph using two interlinguas. Sometimes two interlinguas are used in translation. It is possible that one of the two covers more of the characteristics of the source language, and the other possess more of the characteristics of the target language. The translation then proceeds by converting sentences from the first language into sentences closer to the target language through two stages. The system may also be set up such that the second interlingua uses a more specific vocabulary that is closer, or more aligned with the target language, and this could improve the translation quality. The above-mentioned system is based on the idea of using linguistic proximity to improve the translation quality from a text in one original language to many other structurally similar languages from only one original analysis. This principle is also used in pivot machine translation, where a natural language is used as a \\"bridge\\" between two more distant languages. For example, in the case of translating to English from Ukrainian using Russian as an intermediate language.Bogdan Babych, Anthony Hartley, and Serge Sharoff (2007) \\"Translating from under-resourced languages: comparing direct transfer against pivot translation\\". Proceedings of MT Summit XI, 10–14 September 2007, Copenhagen, Denmark. pp.29—35 Translation process In interlingual machine translation systems, there are two monolingual components: the analysis of the source language and the interlingual, and the generation of the interlingua and the target language. It is however necessary to distinguish between interlingual systems using only syntactic methods (for example the systems developed in the 1970s at the universities of Grenoble and Texas) and those based on artificial intelligence (from 1987 in Japan and the research at the universities of Southern California and Carnegie Mellon). The first type of system corresponds to that outlined in Figure 1. while the other types would be approximated by the diagram in Figure 4. The following resources are necessary to an interlingual machine translation system: Figure 4. Machine translation in a knowledge-based system. * Dictionaries (or lexicons) for analysis and generation (specific to the domain and the languages involved). * A conceptual lexicon (specific to the domain), which is the knowledge base about events and entities known in the domain. * A set of projection rules (specific to the domain and the languages). * Grammars for the analysis and generation of the languages involved. One of the problems of knowledge-based machine translation systems is that it becomes impossible to create databases for domains larger than very specific areas. Another is that processing these databases is very computationally expensive. Efficacy One of the main advantages of this strategy is that it provides an economical way to make multilingual translation systems. With an interlingua it becomes unnecessary to make a translation pair between each pair of languages in the system. So instead of creating n (n-1) language pairs, where n is the number of languages in the system, it is only necessary to make 2n pairs between the n languages and the interlingua. The main disadvantage of this strategy is the difficulty of creating an adequate interlingua. It should be both abstract and independent of the source and target languages. The more languages added to the translation system, and the more different they are, the more potent the interlingua must be to express all possible translation directions. Another problem is that it is difficult to extract meaning from texts in the original languages to create the intermediate representation.

Craig was then transferred to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and continued to thwart counterfeiters.\\"In Other Counties\\", Altoona Tribune, p. 6 (July 10, 1901).\\"Serious Charge Against Cathey\\", The Tennessean, p. 3 (January 22, 1901).\\"Counterfeiter Surrenders\\", Meyersdale Republic, p. 1 (August 15, 1901).\\"Net for Coiners\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post, p. 1 (July 9, 1901).\\"Counterfeiters Eluded the Officers\\", The Philadelphia Times, p. 4 (July 10, 1901).  Protecting presidents  Craig and Theodore Roosevelt When President William McKinley visited Buffalo, New York for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, the Secret Service assigned Craig to help protect the President, and Craig was there when McKinley was shot.\\"Craig a Man After the President's Heart\\", Washington Times (September 4, 1902). Vice-President Theodore Roosevelt subsequently arrived in Buffalo, and Craig was then assigned to guard him, and would continue to do so as long as Craig lived. After the assassination of McKinley, the Secret Service was formally and permanently given the task of presidential protection. Although Roosevelt was sometimes annoyed by his Secret Service detail and sought to escape them, Craig set up a cordon of protection around Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill vacation home that prevented much greater annoyance by people from New York City who wanted to visit the President for various reasons. Craig became almost a part of Roosevelt's family, and was especially close to the Roosevelt children, including four-year-old Quentin Roosevelt who joined him to read comics. Craig was killed on September 3, 1902, when a speeding trolley car rammed into the open horse-drawn carriage carrying President Roosevelt in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Craig, who was sitting at the front of the carriage next to the driver, reportedly turned back to see the oncoming trolley car, and maybe had time to shout or try to shield Roosevelt.\\"The Pittsfield Streetcar Driver Who Nearly Killed Teddy Roosevelt\\", New England Historical Society. Accessed May 16, 2019.Boston Globe, p. 5 (September 4, 1902). Craig was then thrown from the carriage and crushed by the trolley. Also in the carriage were Massachusetts governor Winthrop M. Crane and presidential assistant George B. Cortelyou who both survived. The President received cuts and bruises, and kneeling next to the wreckage said \\"Poor Craig. How my children will feel.\\" The President later said: \\"The man who was killed was one of whom I was fond and whom I greatly prized for his loyalty and faithfulness.\\" The driver of the trolley, Euclid Madden, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was fined, and served six months in jail. The crash occurred because Madden and his passengers had departed late, and were speeding to catch up with the President whom they wanted to meet or hear. At the time of his death, Craig was engaged to marry actress Katherine Murphy. He was buried in Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago. In 2002, one hundred years after his death, Craig's life was commemorated with a cemetery procession of bagpipes and drums, accompanied by police, Secret Service officials, and Craig's relatives.

Life  Frederica portrayed in her youth at the Danish court Frederica Amalie was a daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark and his wife, Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her father had been crowned king on 23 November 1648, about five months before she was born. She was married at Glücksburg Castle on 24 October 1667 to Duke Christian Albert of Holstein-Gottorp as part of a peace treaty between Denmark and Holstein-Gottorp, but the hostile parties continued to fight. The marriage was unhappy, with Frederica Amalia often tormented by the frequent disagreements between her brother, Christian V of Denmark, and her spouse. She was reportedly well known to be badly treated by Christian Albert, while the Danish royal family gave her all sorts of personal privileges and proofs of affection. The couple visited her sister, the Swedish queen Ulrika Eleonora. Her visits to Sweden inspired great parties and festivities at the otherwise strict Swedish court, and were much appreciated. She became a widow in 1695. As her sons were also anti-Danish, the conflict between Denmark and Holstein- Gottorp continued to put her in a difficult position also as a widow; when she died in her residence in Kiel in 1704, a conflict between Holstein-Gottorp and Denmark about the proper way to ring the bells at her funeral almost provoked war between the two states.

The refuge borders the Niobrara National Scenic River on the west and is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. From 1879 to 1906, the Fort Niobrara Military Reservation was located on what later became refuge lands to house a garrison of the U.S. Cavalry. After the fort was closed, the effort to preserve the region as a wildlife refuge culminated in the creation of the refuge on January 11, 1912. The refuge also manages Valentine and John and Louise Seier National Wildlife Refuges as parts of the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The reservation was created by Executive order in 1912: > January 11, 1912. Niobrara Reservation. Embracing parts of townships thirty- > three and thirty-four north, ranges twenty-six and twenty-seven west, Sixth > Principal Meridian, Nebraska, the same being a part of the abandoned Fort > Niobrara Military Reservation.

Fort Niobrara NWR is located along the banks of the Niobrara River in Cherry County. The river has eroded into the limestone, creating cliffs and a varied topography. This unusual alteration to the otherwise relatively featureless great plains presents a unique habitat that fosters numerous plant and animal species. The American Bison Society brought a bison herd to the reservation in 1913 in an effort to repopulate the region with original animal species. Over 230 species of birds have been documented, along with a 350 bison and a small herd of elk (wapiti) that have been restored to the refuge. of the refuge was designated as the Fort Niobrara Wilderness in 1976.

The single was relatively unsuccessful compared to the group's releases, and charted at No. 63 in the US Billboard 100 (top 40 in the Cash Box and Record World charts). \\"Break Away\\" sold better abroad, reaching No. 6 in the UK, No. 10 in Ireland, No. 17 in the Netherlands, No. 20 in New Zealand, and No. 29 in Germany. It was the last release on which Brian was named as producer until \\"Child of Winter (Christmas Song)\\" in 1974. Music According to Brian Wilson, his father Murry came up with the idea from watching The Joey Bishop Show on television while it proclaimed, \\"We're gonna break away for a minute and we'll be right back!\\". Brian, at his piano, then composed the song with Murry as they \\"plunked and plunked and plunked\\" and \\"finally got a song going.\\" When asked why Murry used a pseudonym, Brian responded: \\"I don't know. He was nutty. He was crazy, that was his fictitious name.\\" At another time, Brian has said that The Monkees inspired him to write this song. \\"Break Away\\" features Carl Wilson singing verses (with Brian Wilson singing lead from 0:47 to the first chorus) and Al Jardine on the chorus; some have stated that Murry Wilson (who co-wrote the song) recorded the bass part of the song while Mike Love was away.

The single peaked at the No. 63 spot on the Billboard charts; No. 35 in Record World and No. 38 in Cash Box. The single was also released through Capitol Records in the same month in the UK, being the band's final single of the 1960s there. Capitol re-released it in Britain in June 1975, although on that occasion the single failed to make any impact on the charts. On regional US charts the single made the Beach Boys' weakest showing in major markets since the Christmas single \\"The Man with All the Toys\\" five years earlier. Notable success was seen in Council Bluffs-Omaha (No. 4), Indianapolis (No. 10), Columbus (No. 11), Hannibal, MS (No. 12), Calgary (No. 14), Hartford and Fargo (both No. 16). Settling on the bottom rung of top 20 in Los Angeles and Fresno, it stalled in the top 30 in Chicago, Sacramento, and minor playlists of New England (Manchester, New Haven, Cape Cod). It made only scattered showings on playlists of the Southern United States but for its emergence at a joint No. 18 in Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale and Valdosta across Florida- Georgia; low top 30 in Tampa and Sarasota (and in Cleveland, Omaha and Kansas City); top 40 in Atlanta (and New York and Seattle elsewhere).

It was included on the 2012 Beach Boys Made in California CD boxed set. Live versions \\"Break Away\\" was performed live following its release in 1969 but has not been played since. However, Brian Wilson performed the song regularly during his 2005 solo tour, with Wilson taking over the lead voice originally provided by brother Carl.

He was originally portrayed by D'Urville Martin for two unaired pilots, before the role was recast with Mike Evans. He was later played by Damon Evans (no relation), though Mike Evans eventually returned to the role before the end of the series. Jovan Adepo portrayed the character for the television special Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons. All in the Family On All in the Family, Lionel was portrayed by Mike Evans from 1971 to 1975. Lionel was born in New York City on October 18, 1953. His character is significant for being one of the first TV portrayals of a young, opinionated black man. Lionel is introduced in the first episode (and, in fact, appears on screen before Archie Bunker does). In one of the early episodes, the Jeffersons move into a house down the block from the Bunkers (later, the house is said to be next door). This event creates tension for Archie, though it elates Michael and Gloria. As Lionel's parents and uncle Henry appear more frequently, Lionel's role becomes less significant. Archie considers himself to be Lionel's good friend and even mentor. For his part, Lionel remains unfazed by Archie's racism and unrelenting condescension. Lionel is generally amused, rather than angered or irritated, by Archie's frequent displays of ignorance and bigotry, often seeing Archie's comments as well-meaning, albeit ignorant, rather than outright malicious. As such, Lionel often enjoys patronizing Archie's attitudes by playing dumb in conversations and adopting a stereotypical speech pattern (saying things like \\"I'm gon' be a 'lectical engineer!\\" or \\"Lawd almighty, what is we gonna do?\\"). Lionel's patience runs out when Archie tells him not to see his niece socially because \\"white ought to stay with white and colored ought to stay with colored\\". Lionel finally tells Archie off (albeit calmly), but also lets him know that they can remain friends. Of those in the Bunker household, Lionel is closest to Archie's son-in-law Michael Stivic. Lionel sometimes loses patience with Michael, feeling that Michael relates to him as a representative of the black community rather than as an individual. The Jeffersons All in the Family's spinoff The Jeffersons premiered in 1975. Without the Bunkers as foils, Lionel's role focuses more on his family life and his relationship with Jenny Willis (daughter of interracial couple Tom and Helen Willis). They eventually marry and gave birth to a daughter, Jessica. During the final season of The Jeffersons, Lionel and Jenny announce they are seeking a divorce (after living apart for several years while Lionel worked in Japan). Mike Evans left The Jeffersons after its first season in order to devote more time to writing for Maude spin-off Good Times, which he had helped create. Damon Evans (no relation to Mike) played the role from the fall of 1975 until early 1978. Mike Evans returned to the series in September 1979 and appeared regularly as Lionel for two more seasons. Evans appeared infrequently after that, and made his final appearance as Lionel in the two- part episode \\"Sayonara\\" in 1985.

Other colonialism is often studied for the effects upon those already inhabiting the colonized area, but students of suburban colonization tend to take greater interest in the effects upon the metropole.  Services and taxes favor suburbs  As hinterlands acquire more population and more power then, according to the one man one vote principle, they get more votes in representative bodies, notably metropolitan regions or greater urban areas such as the Greater Toronto Area or Greater London. Suburban votes then come to outweigh inner city votes, just as, a century earlier, urbanization or urban colonialization diminished the power of rural voters. Decisions of these bodies accordingly begin to favor people who live in suburbs, providing more car-oriented and commuter services and more favorable property tax rates for single family homes as tenants in downtown apartment buildings pay higher rates. In urban areas that are growing rapidly, services may be developed that favor urban sprawl, such as large trunk sewers, express highways or shopping malls, as other services such as youth recreation disappear from downtown areas. This increases population drain to the suburbs as quality of life drops, but the increased population may then drive more people further out to the hinterlands which increases the political rewards (especially political donations from real estate developers building greenfield developments) for sprawl.  Urban bankruptcy requires outside aid  In very extreme cases, where cities are unable to recover costs of serving a vast suburban hinterland and are politically controlled by a larger jurisdiction, such as Manhattan within New York State, cities may go bankrupt as New York City in fact did in the 1970s. This had been predicted by urbanists including Jane Jacobs who had fought Robert Moses and his plan for the Cross-Manhattan Expressway system which was eventually defeated. The City only recovered with federal aid and urban autonomy rights including the right to levy its own income tax which it still has.  Suburban flight polarizes communities  Cities with impoverished downtown services can suffer riots or major unrest, as Los Angeles and Detroit did in the 1960s to 1980s. Such incidents speed the flight of middle class residents to the suburbs and sometimes to gated community developments where they are insulated from urban problems, and consume a very different range of services than downtown residents, which again are favored strongly by political representatives.  Forced mergers further reduce downtown power  In some cases, notably Toronto and Montreal in the 1990s, a larger political unit will force smaller urban units to merge against the will of residents, and this further increases the hold of the outer suburban regions as they hold a majority of seats in the new aggregated city council. Where a strong mayor system applies, the larger number of suburban residents will likely also control that post, and the need to campaign over a larger urban area will tend to exclude grassroots candidates or anti-poverty activist candidates not funded nor supported by wealthier suburban voters or real estate developers. Those who speak for the city may live on its outer edges. Mayors may be former mayors of former suburban cities such as Mel Lastman, former mayor of North York who became Mayor of Toronto once those cities (and three others) were merged in 1998. The political consequences of both mergers were severe. In Quebec, the Parti Québécois government was defeated by Jean Charest who permitted Montreal to hold a referendum in which it was permitted to de-amalgamate politically and regain the separate pre-merger urban identities. In Toronto no such relief occurred but a Province of Toronto movement emerged under Jane Jacobs (who had moved to Toronto in the 1960s and again fought expressways penetrating the downtown there, notably the Spadina Expressway and Front Street Extension), 2000 Lastman opponent Tooker Gomberg and Mayor in 2003 (after Lastman) David Miller.  Theoretical analyses  Joel Garreau in Edge City described the growth of cities on the edge of major urban areas, which became population and power centres in themselves. Dale Johnston in Lost in the Suburbs described a cultural and political gap that occurred in New Jersey and Ontario in the early 1990s when suburban voters began to outnumber urban or rural voters, and began to perceive that they were paying taxes to provide urban areas with services that were not duplicated in their community. Meanwhile, suburban communities would export problems to the cities, typically in the form of drug addicts, homelessness, smog, prostitution and other crimes serving suburban residents, and the need to accommodate a large number of commuters and their sewage and parking requirements. As downtown residents and suburban voters became estranged, each perceived themselves subsidizing the other, and accordingly a common solution, called in both New Jersey and Ontario the Common Sense Revolution, transferred funds from urban needs to suburban sprawl, triggering a decline in urban quality of life in both places, as population further spread out and downtowns became more hostile to suburban visitors.

The player navigates a snake through an enclosed maze, consuming objects, and the length of the snake increases with each object consumed. The game was the first to include nine scoring digits, allowing players to surpass one billion points. Home versions were published in 1983 by Datasoft for the Atari 8-bit family and the Apple II. Gameplay Nibbler was a maze-and-munch game, among many others which followed Pac-Man, but the game features no enemies, and a life is lost only when the snake bites itself. Competitive play World-record attempts by Tim McVey and Dwayne Richard at MAGFest in 2009 Nibbler is the first video game to feature a nine-digit scoring system allowing players to score one billion points. The first to achieve this feat was a seventeen-year-old named Tim McVey, who scored 1,000,042,270 points on January 17, 1984, while playing continuously for 44 hours over two days at Walter Day's Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa. A local news crew arrived to film him on location as he closed in on the record. McVey stated in a 2016 interview that he quit playing of his own accord due to exhaustion after setting the mark. For his achievement, McVey, an Ottumwa native, had the day of January 28, 1984 declared in his honor. He additionally received his own Nibbler machine as a prize, which he later gave to a rival arcade in exchange for two hundred dollars in game tokens. On September 27, 1984, Italian player Enrico Zanetti topped McVey with a 1,001,073,840 score, but it was not officially recognized by Twin Galaxies, who ultimately stopped verifying record scores for the game altogether; however, this score was grandfathered in retroactively as a historical record due to a new ruling that permitted significant and well-documented media coverage, although the former record was only officialized after McVey took back the record from Rick Carter. In September 2008, Dwayne Richard of Grande Prairie, Alberta, gained media attention when he fell short in his attempt to become the first player since McVey to officially surpass one billion points. McVey's mark consequently stood for nearly three decades before it was surpassed twice, including once by Richard in 2009, but McVey was still recognized by Guinness World Records as the official record holder because others' scores were never submitted for verification. Rick Carter of Glen Burnie, Maryland officially claimed the new world record with a score of 1,002,222,360 on July 31, 2011. McVey regained the mark on December 25, 2011, with a score of 1,041,767,060. Legacy The documentary Man vs. Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler, about the difficulties of achieving a one-billion point score on Nibbler, was released in 2016. During the credits Elijah Hayter is shown with a score of 1,042,774,470 in June 2012, and Rick Carter is shown with 1,231,372,670 points after 53 hours and 8 minutes in November 2012. As of January 2020 neither of these scores have been credited as official by Twin Galaxies.

A month after they were rehearsing as Deranged Diction. In May 1983 they moved to Seattle and disbanded in 1984.https://sonichits.com/artist/Deranged_Diction In 1985, he replaced Steve Turner in the grunge band Green River, which included Mark Arm (later of Mudhoney), Alex Vincent as well as Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, later of Pearl Jam. In 1988, shortly after the release of the band's mini album Rehab Doll, Green River disbanded over band disputes. Singer Mark Arm reunited with Turner (whom Fairweather had replaced in Green River) to form Mudhoney. Fairweather joined former Malfunkshun singer Andrew Wood, Gossard, and Ament, to form Mother Love Bone. The band seemed destined for success until, on March 19, 1990, shortly before the release of their debut album Apple, Andrew Wood died from a heroin overdose.

He is considered to be the first known proponent of Indian materialism, and forerunner to the Charvaka school. He was probably a contemporary of the Buddha and Mahavira. It has frequently been noted that the doctrines of the Lokayata school were considerably drawn from Ajita's teachings. There is no evidence to support that Kesamkambali was a hedonist, because he led a very simple life. He wore a garment made of hair and lived an ascetic lifestyle. He did not wear precious ornaments, did not surround himself with beautiful women, and did not live in gluttony. Hedonism was used as a \\"straw man\\" argument by opponents of Charvaka. Philosophy Like those of Lokayatins, nothing survives of Ajita's teachings in script, except some scattered references made by his opponents for the sake of refutation. Thus, due to the nature of these references, the basic framework of his philosophy has to be derived by filtering out obscure legends associated with him. From Buddhist sources According to a Buddhist legend, Ajita wore a blanket of human hair (Kesakambali in Sanskrit means \\"with the hair blanket\\"), \\"which is described as being the most miserable garment. It was cold in cold weather, and hot in the hot, foul smelling and uncouth\\".Bhaskar (1972) Ajita means \\"unconquered\\", which implies that he was very argumentative. According to an early Buddhist source, Ajita Kesakambali argued that: > There is no such thing as alms or sacrifice or offering. There is neither > fruit nor result of good or evil deeds. A human being is built up of four > elements. When he dies the earthly in him returns and relapses to the earth, > the fluid to the water, the heat to the fire, the wind to the air, and his > faculties pass into space. The four bearers, on the bier as a fifth, take > his dead body away; till they reach the burning ground, men utter forth > eulogies, but there his bones are bleached, and his offerings end in ashes. > It is a doctrine of fools, this talk of gifts. It is an empty lie, mere idle > talk, when men say there is profit herein. Fools and wise alike, on the > dissolution of the body, are cut off, annihilated, and after death they are > not.See: Rhys-Davids.T.W: Dialogues of the Buddha, 1899 quoted in > Chattopadhyaya (1964/1993) pp.194 According to the Brahmajala Sutta, Ajita propounded Ucchedavada (the Doctrine of Annihilation after death) and Tam-Jivam-tam-sariram-vada (the doctrine of identity of the soul and body), which denied the separate existence of an eternal soul. The extent to which these doctrines, which were evidently inherited by Lokayata, were found contemptible and necessary to be refuted in the idealist, theist and religious literature of the time is a possible evidence of their popularity and, perhaps also, their philosophical sophistication. Modern interpretations DD Kosambi, who elsewhereDD Kosambi (1956) calls Ajita a proto-materialist, notesDD Kosambi (1965) that he \\"preached a thoroughgoing materialist doctrine: good deeds and charity gained a man nothing in the end. His body dissolved into the primary elements at death, no matter what he had or had not done. Nothing remained. Good and evil, charity and compassion were all irrelevant to a man's fate.\\" See also * Ajivika * Ajñana * Makkhali Gosala * Pakudha Kaccayana * Purana Kassapa * Shramana NotesReferences * Bhaskar, Bhagchandra Jain, Jainism in Buddhist Literature (Alok Prakashan, Nagpur, 1972) * Chattopadhyaya, Debiprasad, Indian Philosophy (People's Publishing House, New Delhi, 1964, 7th Edition: 1993) * Kosambi, DD, An Introduction to the Study of Indian History (Popular Prakashan, Mumbai, India, 1956) * Kosambi, DD, The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1965) * Ñāṇamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.) and Bodhi, Bhikkhu (ed.), The Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya (Wisdom Publications, Boston, 2001) . * Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.)

In 1992 the town had an approximate population of 300 with approximately 120 homes and a local school overseeing 51 students. Next to the school are the three local tennis courts which are regularly used. Up the hill is the Town Hall, Churches and CFA which protects the area. Platypus can be spotted in the local creek, and wombats also have burrows in the river banks. Naming  It is thought by some that Darraweit Guim means \\"where 3 creeks meet\\" in a local Aboriginal language. Another legend has it that \\"Darraweit' means the meeting and \\"Guim\\" means the turn which the course of the water makes in the township. Which legend is correct no one is sure, but according to the Postal Department record of Post Offices in the Commonwealth of Australia, it is the only one known by that name. The first survey of the district was made in 1851 by Surveyor Foote, who gave it the name of Darraweit Guim, which was approved by the authorities in Sydney. History=The Toll Bar It would appear that when early settlement was started it was at the Toll Bar Corner which is the junction of the now Old Broadmeadows road and the Darraweit Guim road. In the early 1860s Mr and Mrs Francis conducted a general store there and also collected the toll at the Toll gates. This toll was a charge made on those using the road and went to the maintenance of the road. There was also a hotel or wine shanty conducted by the Cummins family, descendants of whom are still in the district. One of the \\"Toll Gates\\" from Toll Bar corner later hung for many years below Mr Geo. Wilson's house where his property opens on to the road to Darraweit Guim (Stennings Lane). What other places of interest existed at the Toll Bar Hill is difficult to ascertain, but we have heard of a blacksmith, and possibly there would be others who lived there. It has been said that surplus butter from those living on the Deep Creek towards Darraweit Guim was carted to meet the transport wagons (either bullock or horse wagons) at the Toll Bar Corner for transport either to Melbourne or to the Goldfields in Bendigo. The early potatoes grown here were taken to the goldfields, north, rather than to Melbourne as today. In those days it was on the goldfields that the heavy concentration of population was to be found. The Stockdale family who settled at \\"Oakdale\\" in the 1850s and are still there, tell of produce going to the goldfields. Mrs Stockdale, snr was a Cummins of the Toll Bar, and the first of the family at \\"Oakdale\\" was born in 1858. Township area It would appear from the early parish plan that the township area was made available for selection in the year 1866, though some allotments were granted as early as 1864. Some of these earlier ones are the blocks opposite Chas. Coustley's and selected in the name of J. Crough, along with several lying to the north of them in the name of W. J. Lobb. J. Purves selected as early as 1864. As many of the blocks bear the date 18/5/1, 1866 it would appear that that date rated high in the selection calendar. The block where the store stands was granted to Cornelius Francis on that day, as were those between the then Wesleyan Church and then Presbyterian Church. Above the Presbyterian Church there were four blocks in the name of T. Shelley and one in the name of E. Maher, all allotted between 3/5/1 and 6/7/1, 1867. Natural disasters During the winter Deep Creek in Darraweit Guim is prone to the occasional flood and did so in 1906, 1916, 1934, 1964 and 1990, at its height reaching above the waist. Then in the summer the area was prone to bush fires and in 1904 & 1927 massive sections of the area were burned. Since those times technology and organisation skills have minimised the risks. Even so, in 1969 fires destroyed 12 homes. Both the town's churches and the town hall were also destroyed, and later rebuilt. Post office  The general store, now closed Wallan Wallan post office was opened in 1858 and serviced Darraweit Guim 6 times a week until the Darraweit Guim Office was opened in 1868 (closed 1976). It often shifted between households and continued until the mid-1950s when Wallan reclaimed the run. Rail to the area was surveyed in the 1880s but was never followed through with. The town's general store closed in the 1980s, reopened for a while in the 1990s by the Guy family. The current owners hoped to reopen it, but it is getting a bit dilapidated  Pioneering families  Anderton, Barry, Breen, Brown, Cleve, Coustley, Cummins, Delaney, Doheney, Doyle, Elder, Francis, Howden, Lade, Lobb, Maher, McCabe, McDonald, McDonell, Moore, Stenning, Stockdale, Tom, Waitt, Wilson and Aungier.

He was born in Rome not later than 1035 to one of the most notable Roman families of Jewish scholars. Owing to an error propagated by Azulai, he has been regarded as a scion of the house of De Pomis. However, according to present scholarship, it is almost a certainty that he belonged to the Anaw (Degli Mansi) family. Nathan's father, R. Jehiel ben Abraham, aside from being an acknowledged authority on the ritual law, was, like the majority of the contemporary Italian rabbis, a liturgic poet. His travels The details of Nathan's sad life must be excerpted and pieced together from several autobiographic verses appended to the first edition of his lexicon. It appears that he began life not as a student, but as a peddler of linen wares, which was then considered a distasteful occupation. The death of his employer caused him to abandon trade for the Torah. He returned home, where his father began to bestow upon him the treasures of learning, the accumulation of which was continued under foreign masters. First, Nathan went to Sicily, whither Matzliach ibn al-Batzaq had just returned from a course of study under Hai Gaon, the last of the Pumbedita geonim. It was there that Nathan garnered that Babylonian learning which has led some to the erroneous notion that he had himself pilgrimed to Pumbedita. Then Narbonne enticed him, where he sat under the prominent exegete and aggadist R. Moses ha-Darshan. On his way home he probably lingered for a while at the several academies flourishing in Italy, notably at Pavia, where a certain R. Moses was head master, and at Bari, where R. Moses Kalfo taught. He arrived home, however, from his scholarly travels some time before the death of his father, which occurred about the year 1070, and which gave him the opportunity of illustrating the simplicity of funeral rites which he had been advocating. The presidency of the rabbinic college was thereupon entrusted by the Roman community to Jehiel's three learned sons: Daniel, Nathan, and Abraham – \\"the geonim of the house of R. Jehiel,\\" as they were styled.Shibbolei ha-Lekket 2:5 Daniel, the eldest, seems to have composed a commentary on the mishnaic section Zera'im, from which the \\"'Arukh\\" quotes frequently, and to have stood in friendly relations with Christian scholars. The three brothers rapidly acquired general recognition as authorities on the Torah; and numerous inquiries were addressed to them. Their most frequent correspondent was R. Solomon ben Isaac (Yitzhaki), an Italian scholar who is not to be identified with Rashi. The Arukh First page from the first edition of the Arukh (ca. 1480) Nathan's private life was extremely sad. All his children died very young; and the bereaved father sought solace in philanthropy and scholarly application. In the year 1085 he built a communal bathhouse conforming to the ritual law; and about seventeen years later (September, 1101) he and his brothers erected a beautiful synagogue. In February 1101 he had completed his magnum opus – the Arukh. The sources of this work are numerous. Aside from the Arukh of Tzemach ben Poltoi, which he utilized (it should be stated, however, that Rapoport and Geiger deny this), he used a very large number of additional works. Above all, he placed under contribution the information received, in both oral and written form, from R. Maẓliaḥ and R. Moses ha-Darshan, the former of whom, in particular, through his studies under Hai, had made himself the repository of Eastern learning. The entire extent of Nathan's indebtedness to his authorities can not be estimated, for the reason that of the hundreds of books cited by him many have not been preserved. But none will deny his obligation to R. Gershom of Mainz, whom he repeatedly quotes, though, as Kohut rightly maintains against Rapoport, he can not have been his personal disciple. Similarly he used the writings of R. Hananeel b. Chushiel and R. Nissim ben Jacob, both living at Kairwan. So frequent, in fact, were the references to R. Hananeel in the lexicon that R. Jacob Tam, for example, regarded the work as based entirely on R. Hananeel's commentaries,Sefer ha- Yashar, p. 525 while the author of the Or Zarua, as a matter of course, referred to R. Hananeel almost all of the lexicon's anonymous statements. Hai Gaon, again, figures very frequently in its pages, sometimes simply designated as \\"the Gaon,\\" while it has particularly assimilated all philologic material that is contained in his commentary on the mishnaic order Tohorot. Method and scope Since the structure of the Arukh consists, as it were, of so many bricks, it is hard to decide whether the builder really possessed all the linguistic learning stored up in it. None can gainsay the author's philologic spirit of inquiry – quite remarkable for his day, which antedated the science of linguistics; his frequent collation of \\"variæ lectiones\\" is notable, while his fine literary sense often saved him from crude etymological errancies. Nevertheless, the multitude of languages marshaled in the Arukh is prodigious even for a period of polyglot proclivities. The non-Jewish Aramaic dialects are encountered side by side with Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and even Slavonic, while Italian seems as familiar to the author as the various rabbinic forms of style. This multiplicity of languages, however, is at present generally considered a mere mark of the multifarious character of the compilation; and the credit for the exegetic employment of the several languages is given to Nathan's authorities rather than to himself. While he undoubtedly possessed a superficial and empiric knowledge of Latin and Greek, of which the former already contained an admixture of contemporary Italian, and the latter (subdivided into spoken and written Greek) was still partly used in southern Italy; while he may have acquired a desultory acquaintance with Arabic, and certainly was quite familiar with Italian, yet it may be stated almost with certainty that the majority of his etymologies were compiled and copied from his various source-books. For this reason, perhaps, the various dialects appear in the Arukh under several names, each originating seemingly in a different author, as Arabic, for example, which occurs under three distinct denotations, possibly without Nathan being aware of their synonymity. To the same cause may be assigned the polyonymy of the Hebrew and rabbinic dialects in the Arukh, as well as the presence of a great deal of geographic and ethnographic information which the author certainly did not acquire in actual travel. As regards the grammatical derivation of Hebrew words, Nathan deviated from the principle of triliteral roots discovered by Judah ben David Chayyuj and adopted by the Spanish grammarians as a rule; like most French and German rabbis, he considered two letters, and at times one, sufficient to form a Hebrew root. Its importance The Arukh is significant as a monument in the history of culture. Aside from its purely scientific value as a storehouse of old readings and interpretations as well as of titles of many lost books, it is important as the only literary production of the Italian Jews of that age. Moreover, though mainly a compilation, it is one of the most noteworthy medieval monuments of learning. Compiled at the historic juncture when Jewish scholarship was transplanted from Babylonia and northern Africa to Europe and was subject to the perils of aberration, it signally emphasized the necessity of preserving the old rabbinical treasures and traditions. Its service in this respect was equivalent to that rendered by the two great products of contemporary Spanish and French Jews – Alfasi's Talmudic code and Rashi's commentary. Together the three contributed toward the spread of rabbinic study. Besides, one has to depend upon the Arukh for whatever knowledge one may have of the intellectual condition of the Italian Jews in the 11th-century. Since its author, for example, uses the Italian language freely to elucidate etymologies, that he frequently offers the vernacular nomenclature for objects of natural history, that he repeatedly calls into service for purposes of illustration the customs of foreign peoples, the character of the reading public of his day can easily be inferred. The dawn of skepticism may be discerned in his remark that as regards conjuring and amulets neither their grounds nor their sources were known.Aruch Completum, vii. 157, s.v. Influence and editions The Arukh rapidly achieved a wide circulation. According to Kohut, even Rashi was already in a position to utilize it in the second edition of his commentaries, having been acquainted with it by R. Kalonymus ben Shabbethai, the noted rabbi who had moved to Worms from Rome. Kalonymus, however, can at best have transported to his new home but meager information concerning the Arukh, as his removal occurred about thirty years prior to its completion; the first folios he may well have seen, since he was intimately acquainted with Nathan. A generation after the time of Rashi the Arukh is found in general use among the Biblical commentators and the tosafists, as well as among the legalistic and the grammatical authors. Numerous manuscript copies were brought into circulation; and with the introduction of printing its spread was widely extended. The first edition, which bears neither the date nor the place of publication, probably belongs to the year 1477, while in 1531 Daniel Bomberg of Venice issued what is no doubt the best of the early editions. In both the copying and the printing processes, however, the work suffered innumerable alterations and mutilations, which have been recently repaired to a certain extent by the scientific edition issued, on the basis of the first editions and of seven manuscripts, by Alexander Kohut.Aruch Completum, 8 vols. and supplement, Vienna and New York, 1878–92 Supplements and compendia A further proof of the popularity gained by the Arukh lies in the numerous supplements and compendiums which soon clustered about it. Until recent times, all rabbinic lexicons have been grounded on the Arukh. The first supplement was written in the 12th century by R. Samuel ben Jacob ibn Jam'i or Jama'J. Q. R. x. 514 of Narbonne, under the title Agur,Edited by Solomon Buber in Grätz Jubelschrift, Hebr. part, pp. 1–47 a small work of little significance. In the 13th century, R. Tanchum ben Joseph of Jerusalem wrote a lexicon, Al-Murshid al-Kafi, which purposed not only to replace the Arukh, which had grown rare, but also to complete and to correct it. Abraham Zacuto, author of the Yuḥasin, at the beginning of the 16th century composed a supplement entitled Iḳḳere ha- Talmud, of which only a fragment of the latter part has come down. About the same time Sanctus Pagninus, a Christian, issued an Enchiridion Expositionis Vocabulorum Haruch, Thargum, Midraschim Rabboth, et Aliorum Librorum.Rome, 1523; Steinschneider, Cat. Bodl. col. 2083 The general method of the Arukh was also adopted by Elijah Levita, who, in his Meturgeman and Tishbi, advanced a step in that he differentiated the targumic and the Talmudic words and also sought to complete his prototype. The manner and the matter of the Arukh were closely followed by Johannes Buxtorf in his Lexicon Chaldaicum Talmudicum,Basel, 1639 and by David de Pomis in his Tzemach David. Early in the seventeenth century Menahem Lonzano issued his small but useful supplement, Ma'arikh, concerned particularly with foreign words.In Shetei Yadot, Venice, 1618; newly edited by Jellinek, Leipzig, 1853 Ma'arikh ha- Ma'arekhet, a compilation by Philippe d'Aquin, appeared in Paris in 1629. No doubt the best supplements to the Arukh were written in the same century by Benjamin Musaphia, a physician at Hamburg, and by David ha-Kohen de Lara. Mussafia's Musaf he-'Arukh (1655), probably known also as Arukh he-Hadash, according to Immanuel Löw, devoted itself particularly to the Greek and Latin derivatives, leaning largely on Buxtorf. De Lara (d. 1674) published Keter Kehunnah (Hamburg, 1668), in which he had set before himself polyglot purposes, and which, though brought down to \\"resh,\\" was published only as far as the letter \\"yod\\".Steinschneider, l.c. col. 875 His smaller work, on the other hand, Ir David (Amsterdam, 1638), of which the second part was called Metzudat Tziyyon, confined itself almost exclusively to Greek derivatives. Even the nineteenth century witnessed the publication of several works accredited to the classic lexicon. Isaiah Berlin (d. 1799) wrote Hafla'ah Sheba-'Arakhin,Breslau, 1830; Vienna, 1859; Lublin, 1883 annotations to the Arukh. Similar notes were appended by I. M. Landau to his unscientific edition of the Arukh;5 vols., Prague, 1819–40 while S. Lindermann has issued elucidations under the title Sarid ba-'Arakhin (Thorn, 1870). Besides, there are several anonymous dictionaries attached to the same classic, e.g., the abbreviated Arukh, Arukh ha-Katzar, known also as Kitzur Arukh, which was successively printed at Constantinople (1511), Cracow (1591), and Prague (1707), and which contains merely the explanation of words, without their etymologies. Another short Arukh, frequently cited by Buxtorf, and discovered in a manuscript at Bern, has been found to contain numerous French and German annotations. Of such epitomes there has no doubt been a multitude in manuscript form. A dictionary of still wider scope than the Arukh is the Sefer Melitzah of Solomon ben Samuel.

Tangles are formed by hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule protein known as tau, causing the protein to dissociate from microtubules and form insoluble aggregates. (These aggregations are also called paired helical filaments.) The mechanism of tangle formation is not well understood, and whether tangles are a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease or play a peripheral role is unknown. Detection and imaging ;Post- mortem: Tau tangles are seen microscopically in stained brain samples. ;Pre- mortem: In living patients tau tangle locations can be imaged with a PET scan using a suitable radio-emissive agent.Alzheimer 'tau' protein far surpasses amyloid in predicting toll on brain tissue  Alzheimer's disease  Abnormal accumulation of tau protein in neuronal cell bodies (arrow) and neuronal extensions (arrowhead) in the neocortex of a patient who died with Alzheimer's disease. The bar = 25 microns (0.025 millimeters). Neurofibrillary tangles were first described by Alois Alzheimer in one of his patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The tangles are considered a secondary tauopathy. AD is also classified as an amyloidosis because of the presence of senile plaques. When tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, the protein dissociates from the microtubules in axons. Then, tau becomes misfolded and the protein begins to aggregate, which eventually forms the neurofibrillary tangles seen in Alzheimer’s patients. Microtubules also destabilize when tau is dissociated. The combination of the neurofibrillary tangles and destabilized microtubules result in disruption of processes such as axonal transport and neural communication. The degree of NFT involvement in AD is defined by Braak stages. Braak stages I and II are used when NFT involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain, stages III and IV when there's also involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and V and VI when there's extensive neocortical involvement. This should not be confused with the degree of senile plaque involvement, which progresses differently.

Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), another type of dementia, is marked by an abundance of argyrophilic grains and coiled bodies upon microscopic examination of brain tissue. Some consider it to be a type of Alzheimer's disease. It may co-exist with other tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, and also Pick's disease. Tauopathies are often overlapped with synucleinopathies, possibly due to interaction between the synuclein and tau proteins. The non-Alzheimer's tauopathies are sometimes grouped together as \\"Pick's complex\\" due to their association with frontotemporal dementia, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

He is notable as the lead singer and guitarist of The Cowsills, who had three top 10 singles in the late 1960s. From the mid-1970s until his death, he developed a career in Canada as an alt- country artist, as well as being the producer of a diverse number of Canadian artists. History=The Cowsills Bill Cowsill was born in Middletown, Rhode Island, the eldest child of the seven Cowsill children—six boys and one girl—and was named after his father, William \\"Bud\\" Joseph Cowsill Sr. (1925–1992). At a young age, Bill began singing with his younger brother, Bob (born August 26, 1949), playing guitars provided for them by their father, Bud, then serving in the U.S. Navy. The brothers had originally wanted to form a rock band. At their father's insistence, Bill and Bob Cowsill formed The Cowsills in 1965 with their brothers Barry on bass and John on drums. Their father became their full-time manager, following his retirement from the Navy. He was physically and emotionally abusive towards his family, in both his spousal and parental roles. Such abuse continued during his role as the group's manager. The group started playing around Newport before they recorded their first single \\"All I Really Wanna Be is Me\\" in 1967 on the independent label, Joda. While the first single failed to chart, an appearance on the NBC Today Show to promote it led to Mercury Records offering them a contract. However, three singles on that label failed to spark interest, and they were dropped. Artie Kornfeld, their producer at that time, remained convinced of the band's potential and persuaded Barbara to contribute to backing vocals behind Bill's lead on \\"The Rain, The Park & Other Things\\", a song co-written by Kornfeld. It was their first single released on MGM Records, and was also included in their first eponymously titled MGM album. After the success of that single, their younger sister Susan and brother Paul joined the band. This was followed by Bill's attempt to get remaining brother Richard in the group. Bill had been impressed by Richard's drumming and set him up for an audition with father Bud, but after listening for about 30 seconds Bud flatly rejected Richard from joining the group. \\"The Rain, The Park & Other Things\\" single sold over a million copies in late 1967 and reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second MGM album, We Can Fly, released in 1968 and produced by Billy Cowsill, at the age of twenty,Credits for We Can Fly; AllMusic.

In 1968, \\"Indian Lake\\" (from their third MGM album Captain Sad and his Ship of Fools) became another top 10 hit, while in 1969 their version of the title track from Hair, with Billy Cowsill singing lead vocals, peaked at No. 2. The Cowsills made regular television appearances, which led to Columbia Pictures considering a sitcom based on their story and starring most of the members of the band; the deal was abandoned when the producers of the show wanted to replace Barbara in the cast. The show would later become The Partridge Family, with David Cassidy playing the lead singer and Shirley Jones as the mother. It was commonly thought that Cowsill's involvement with the family band came to an abrupt end in 1969 when his father, Bud, caught him smoking marijuana, and he was immediately expelled by his father from the group. In fact, Cowsill's dismissal occurred one day after he and his father were in a drunken physical altercation in the lounge of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas. The dispute was over Bud Cowsill's insults in relation Billy Cowsill's circle of friends, guitarist Waddy Wachtel in particular. State troopers had to be called to break up the fight between father and son. Billy Cowsill was dismissed from the group the next day.Uncredited, Shadowy Man. Vancouver Magazine, April 1995. As reprinted in Silver Threads - Cowsills Website. Retrieved 2014-10-18. According to his brother Bob, Billy Cowsill's dismissal was the beginning of the end of the Cowsills as a group, since no other sibling could effectively assume their eldest brother's group leadership role. Following the breakup of the group in 1970, it was discovered that most of the group's wealth had been dissipated through poor investments made or authorized by Bud Cowsill.

Subsequent to his dismissal from The Cowsills, Billy Cowsill was briefly considered as a replacement for Brian Wilson in The Beach Boys' live performances.

There is evidence of Native American activity on the island, possibly dating back as much as 8,000 years, although little archaeological work has been conducted. This site is connected with the prehistoric Post Pattern, and has probably been used by the Southeastern Pomo throughout prehistoric times. The Elem Pomo Colony have claimed the island to be their place of origin, and a political and religious center. A history of ownership disputes dates as far back as the late nineteenth century. Due to a controversial 1949 U.S. court decision, the Elem Pomo tribe lost legal control of of its ancestral land, including the island. At present, legal title to the island is held by a Bay Area businessman, John Nady (founder of Nady Systems, Inc.)About us , nady.com. His 2003 attempt to obtain permits to construct a log cabin on the island was challenged by Elem Indian Colony members but eventually granted.

He found a job teaching Chinese literature at then Chekiang Provincial No.1 Normal School. Meantime, Chen spread the New Culture with colleagues whose passions coincided with his own. The authority decided to dismiss them for that method. Despite students' agitation against the order, he was obliged to return to his hometown in 1920. Thereafter, he assented to the request of Dai Jitao to translate the Communist Manifesto. Dai provided a translation in Japanese. Besides, Li Dazhao also provided its English version. Later, he set up a group on the communist campaign in Shanghai, together with Chen Duxiu, Li Hanjun et al. He became a member of the CPC, after it was established in 1921.

The Communist Party of Germany/Marxist–Leninist (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands/Marxisten-Leninisten, KPD/ML), established on December 31, 1968, was an anti-revisionist pro-China party in West Germany that was later supportive of communist leader of Albania Enver Hoxha after the Sino-Albanian Split. The KPD/ML was formed by former Communist Party of Germany (KPD) official Ernst Aust, who subsequently became the party's chairman, on New Year's Eve 1968 as a split from the KPD. Its periodical was Roter Morgen. Aust was received by Albanian leader Enver Hoxha in a private audience in 1974, while, on June 1, 1975, Yao Wenyuan, a member of the central committee of the Communist Party of China received the KPD/ML chairman. The KPD/ML had its final break with Maoism in 1977. In 1978, with the adoption of a new programme adopted at the party's fourth congress, the KPD/ML disassociated itself from the Three Worlds Theory of the Communist Party of China. Relations between the KPD/ML and the Party of Labour of Albania had significantly cooled by 1984. In 1986, the KPD/ML merged with the International Marxist Group (GIM) to form the Unified Socialist Party (VSP). A handful of members opposed to the VSP split off and formed many parties in the tradition of Aust's KPD/ML after 1986, the most prominent being the Communist International (Stalinists-Hoxhaists), Arbeit Zukunft and the Communist Party of Germany (Roter Morgen). These groups maintain or maintained a strong anti-revisionist ideology. GDR Section Announcement of the formation of the GDR (German Democratic Republic, that is the Eastern Germany) section of the KPD/ML from Roter Morgen in 1976. At the end of 1975 and beginning of 1976, the foundation by the KPD/ML of its own section in the GDR was made public. The corresponding declaration was published in Roter Morgen on February 7, 1976.New Revelations about the Activities and Destruction of the GDR Section of the Communist Party of Germany/Marxist-Leninist (KPD/ML) While the KPD/ML had already been formed in 1968 in the FRG, the nucleus of the GDR Section emerged within the GDR itself. In the beginning of the 1970s, some students in the eleventh and twelfth grades at an Extended Secondary School (Erweiterte Oberschule; EOS) in Berlin got together to study the texts of the classical authors of Marxism–Leninism independently of the official version propagated by the Socialist Unity Party. They were not the only ones in the GDR doing this at that period. Other interested people among their friends and families joined them, so that, in the course of time, a little circle of employees (in the education and technical fields) and students (of medicine, language and literature) was formed. In reading the basic texts of Marxist–Leninist social theory they came more and more to the conclusion that a deep gap existed between theory and practice in \\"actually existing socialism\\". Forbidden in the GDR, confiscated in the West advertisement for KPD/ML paper Roter Morgen. In Magdeburg, during 1969-70, pupils, students and apprentices got together to form the Progressive Youth (Progressive Jugend), inspired - among other things - by the Black Panthers. Besides the classical authors of Marxism–Leninism, various forbidden texts (of Mao, Stalin, the Black Panthers, etc.) were read and discussed by this youth group, whose activities were GDR-wide and which was composed of around 100 young people. After the Progressive Youth had been disintegrated and destroyed, in 1976 the \\"hard core\\" of the Progressive Youth formed a KPD/ML cell. In Rostock, too, an autonomous circle of students was formed with a similar political orientation. Being interested in further ideological inspiration, many of these groups and circles - by themselves - got in touch with various left organizations in West Berlin and with the Albanian embassy in East Berlin. Besides the young people, who were the majority within the GDR Section, some older, battle-hardened comrades joined the Section. For instance, Heinz Reiche, who had spent 11 years in Nazi prisons and concentration camps, took part in activities in Weisswasser (a township south of Cottbus). Reiche had already come into conflict with the SED in the 1950s. During the following years, the KPD/ML was successful in gaining supporters and organizing them into party cells in the GDR. These cells were inspired by the cell system of the illegal KPD during the Nazi dictatorship. Until 1980, according to information from Stasi files, almost a dozen such cells were formed. The total number of members or supporters of the KPD/ML in the GDR amounted to three dozen people. In addition, there were about 50 to 60 sympathizers who were in direct personal contact with the above-mentioned circle.

Central Camp Talerhof (German: Thalerhof) was a concentration camp operated by the Austro-Hungarian imperial government between 1914 and 1917 in the Austrian state of Styria. Central Camp Talerhof 1914-1917 Over twenty thousand Ukrainian Moscophiles were arrested and imprisoned in the camp and in the fortress of Terezín, Bohemia. The camp housed primarily Russophile individuals and families from Galicia. All were suspected of collaboration with the advancing Imperial Russian Army that had invaded and occupied Galicia at the outset of World War I. The first group of prisoners was transported to Talerhof by soldiers of Austrian regiment of Graz on September 4, 1914. Until the winter of 1915, there were no barracks in Talerhof; prisoners slept in the open air on the ground. On November 9, 1914, according to the official report of Field Marshal Schleer, there were 5,700 Ukrainians, Carpatho-Rusyns and Lemkos in Talerhof. In total, 20,000 people were prisoners from September 4, 1914, to May 10, 1917. In the first year and a half, three thousand prisoners died.

Developing out of a poorly organized system on October 8 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October 11\\\\. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving back over water the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. Now moving due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October 12 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October 14\\\\. Bess produced heavy rains throughout the Philippines, especially in Luzon where was measured in Baguio. These rains triggered extensive flooding and landslides that killed 26 people and left 3 others missing. Many homes were destroyed and damage amounted to $9.2 million (1974 USD). On October 12, a reconnaissance plane, with a crew of six, investigating the periphery of the storm went missing. It is presumed that the entire crew was lost when the aircraft crashed off the coast of Luzon. Though the center remained offshore, strong winds and high tides also impacted Hong Kong, causing minor flooding. Meteorological history On October 6, 1974, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance several hundred miles southeast of Guam. Tracking quickly westward to west-northwestward in response to a strong subtropical ridge to the north, the system gradually organized, passing near Ulithi atoll on October 7\\\\. Accompanied by a broad monsoonal flow, the disturbance featured multiple centers of circulation. On October 8, it developed into a tropical depression and soon into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Bess. Early on October 9, an aircraft reconnaissance mission into Bess revealed that a new dominant center of circulation had developed to the north of the original low. The southern low soon dissipated as the northern one became a tropical storm. The northern system retained the name Bess and is considered the same storm by the JTWC. After the northern circulation became the dominant center on October 9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused a decrease in synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October 10 as it approached the northern Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95 km (60 mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120 km/h (75 mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55 km (35 mi) to the north. Due to the interaction with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October 11. As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485 km (300 mi) in diameter. Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west in response to a dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between the two systems, a strong northeasterly flow developed between them. This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400 km (250 mi) from Bess's center. During the evening of October 12, the combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment of cool, dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305 km (190 mi) south of Hong Kong. The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October 14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day. Impact A WC-130H Hercules similar to the one that crashed over the South China Sea Striking northern Luzon as a typhoon, Bess produced damaging winds and torrential rainfall across the region. Gusts peaked at 178 km/h (111 mph) in Aparri, Cagayan while Baguio City experienced gusts of 150 km/h (90 mph). Communication across the region was greatly disrupted as numerous power lines and trees were downed. While much of the peninsula received of rain, a 24‑hour maxima of was reported in Baguio. The rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides, resulting in 26 fatalities and extensive damage. One death took place in Baguio after a girl was buried in a landslide. At least three other people were reported missing. In a town roughly 805 km (500 mi) south of Manila, a landslide destroyed eight homes and a school. Flood waters inundated four villages in the central Philippines. The storm affected a total of 35,562 people, of which about 4,000 became homeless. Total losses amounted to $9.2 million (1974 USD). On October 11, a level one warning signal was raised for Hong Kong, indicating that a tropical cyclone was approaching the region. This was soon raised to level three as strong winds were expected to affect the area. Although the center of Bess passed roughly 305 km (190 mi) south of Hong Kong, the pressure gradient between the tropical storm and high pressure to the north resulted in strong winds across the region. On the Pratas Islands, ten-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) were reported. In Hong Kong itself, winds reached 45 km/h (30 mph) and gusted to 85 km/h (50 mph). Gusts up to 113 km/h (71 mph) occurred on Tate's Cairn. In contrast to the unusually strong winds, Bess produced virtually no rainfall as it passed by, with only a trace of precipitation measured between October 11 and 14 in Hong Kong. Along the coast, abnormally high tides combined with storm surge flooded low-lying areas of the city. Tides at Tai Po Kau reached with a surge of . Sea water leaked into the city's underground sewage system and caused minor flooding in the area's western district. Some property damage was reported. While over the South China Sea on October 12, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules reconnaissance aircraft (call sign Swan 38), with a crew of six, went missing while collecting data on the cyclone. The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October 12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95 km (60 mi) north of Manila. A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors. Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, soundproofing material, and orange cushion-like material. All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead. Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing. Because of the damage and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Bess was retired and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re- introduced to the roster. Coincidentally, it was again retired in 1982 when a powerful storm named Bess caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.

Sukhomlinov was ousted as Minister of War amid allegations of failure to provide the Imperial Russian Army with necessary armaments and munitions for World War I and accused of responsibility for Russia's defeats in the early Eastern Front. Sukhomlinov was tried for high treason, corruption, and abuse of power in a high-profile case that damaged the reputation of Russia's fragile Imperial government. According to some historians, the Sukhomlinov scandal may have done more harm to the Romanov monarchy than the lurid scandals associated with Rasputin.William C. Fuller (2006)The Foe Within: Fantasies of Treason and the End of Imperial Russia, p. 7. Early life and military career Vladimir Aleksandrovich Sukhomlinov was born on 16 August 1848 (O.S. 4 August 1848) in Telšiai, Vilna Governorate, the son of Alexander Pavlovich Sukhomlinov and Olga Ivanovna Lunskaya. Sukhomlinov's younger brother, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Sukhomlinov, appointed the governor of Orenburg Governorate and the ataman of the Orenburg Cossack Army. Sukhomlinov graduated from Nikolayevskoye Cavalry School in 1867 and served in the Uhlans of the Imperial Guard Regiment based in Warsaw. Sukhomlinov graduated from the General Staff Academy in 1874 and participated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, serving for some time on the staff of General Mikhail Skobelev and awarded the Order of St. George 4th class. After the Russo-Turkish War, Sukhomlinov joined the staff at the General Staff Academy on the invitation of its chief, General Mikhail Dragomirov, and lectured as well at the Nicholas Cavalry School, the Corps of Pages, and the Mikhail Artillery School. From 1884 to 1886, Sukhomlinov commanded the 6th Dragoon Regiment at Suwalki. Sukhomlinov served as Chief of the Officers' Cavalry School in St. Petersburg from 1886 until 1898, being promoted General in 1890. His next appointment was as Commander of the 10th Cavalry Division in Kharkov. In 1899, Sukhomlinov was appointed Chief of Staff of the Kiev Military District. In 1902, Sukhomlinov became a deputy commander of the Kiev Military District, and in 1904 became its commander. In 1905, Sukhomlinov was appointed Governor General of Kiev, Podolia, and Volhynia. In December 1908, Sukhomlinov became head of General Staff. Minister of War Sukhomlinov in his office during his time as War Minister (1912) Sukhomlinov was appointed as Minister of War in March 1909, effectively placing him in charge of the Russian armed forces. In this position, Sukhomlinov opposed training innovations that would have placed emphasis on infantry firepower against the use of sabers, lances and bayonets; stating that \\"I have not read a military manual for the last twenty-five years\\". Sukhomlinov's personal charm and popularity with Tsar Nicholas II enabled him to survive accusations of lazy incompetence and dishonesty while in office.Barbara W. Tuchman (1964) \\"The Guns of August\\", pp. 80–82. Four Square Edition Sukhomlinov was standing next to Pyotr Stolypin, who had just resigned as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, when the latter was assassinated inside the Kiev Opera. Disagreement between the Minister and his assistant, General Alexei Polivanov, culminated in 1912 in the dismissal of Polivanov, and his replacement by General Vernander. As Minister of War, Sukhomlinov was never trusted by the Army Committee of the State Duma, led by Alexander Guchkov, and it came to a duel. Sukhomlinov was resented by Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, the commander-in-chief of the Russian forces in the first phase of World War I. Sukhomlinov was not allowed to interfere with Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov, the Stavka, or Grand Duke Nicholas, and all the briefing went through the hands of his assistant, Nikolai Yanushkevich. Despite Sukhomlinov's reforms (or perhaps because of his inefficacy and resistance to change, as some assert), Russia suffered badly in the opening phase of the World War I. After several Russian defeats in East Prussia during the first months of war, on 11 June (O.S.) Sukhomlinov was forced out of office and succeeded by Alexei Polivanov.O. Figes (1996) A People's Tragedy. The Russian Revolution 1891-1924, p. 268, 273. Sukhomlinov held Grand Duke Nicolas, Guchkov and Polivanov responsible for his downfall and went fishing in Saimaa near Imatra, writing articles under the pseudonym Ostap Bondarenko and studying the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92). The Foe Within: Fantasies of Treason and the End of Imperial Russia by William C. Fuller Perception Maurice Paleologue, the last French ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Sukhomlinov as \\"intelligent, clever and cunning, obsequious towards the tsar and a friend of Rasputin—a man who has lost the habit of work—I know few men who inspire more distrust at first sight\\". Sukhomlinov has been considered responsible for Russia's military stagnation from 1905 to 1912, which resulted in the unpreparedness at the outbreak of World War I. On the other hand, in Bayonets Before Bullets, Bruce W. Menning asserts that \\"There was no doubt that he remained committed to building Russia's defensive and offensive military power. ... Thanks to Sukhomlinov's reforms, the peacetime strength of the Imperial Russian Army on the eve of World War I reached 1,423,000 officers and men.\\" Though he has some criticism for the Minister, Menning credits him with simplifying and modernizing the structure of the Russian army corps, including the addition of a six aircraft detachment to each. Norman Stone maintains that Sukhomlinov had \\"an extremely bad press\\" due to his autocratic style and accusations of corruption made by his enemies in the Imperial Duma and the army. The effect of the allegations against him is that \\"Sukhomlinov, as a sort of uniformed Rasputin, belongs to the demonology of 1917. But the case against him is far from watertight.\\" Stone details his position as the leader of an informal group of \\"praetorians\\" in the high ranks of the army: professional soldiers, often from lower- and middle-class backgrounds, with experience in and loyalty to the infantry. As such, Sukhomlinov and his allies were opposed by what Stone calls the \\"patrician\\" faction, upper-class officers owing less of their status to military service, who tended to favor the cavalry and artillery (especially fortress artillery). Stone regards the continued standoff between the two factions as the responsibility of the Czar Nicholas, who played the two sides off against one another as a means of preserving his own freedom of action. In any case, Sukhomlinov did try, with some success, to direct resources away from the static fortifications which would prove less useful in the coming war, to the infantry and mobile artillery. Stone blames Sukhomlinov's failure to achieve more on problems of Russian development economics, and the resistance of the supposedly \\"technocratic\\" patrician faction. Imprisonment and death Sukhomlinov's wife, Madame E.V. Sukhomlinova, who was thirty years his junior, reached out to Rasputin in order to get her husband released from prison. Photo by Karl Bulla On 20 April 1916, the police searched Sukhomlinov's mansion and in the evening he was detained at the Peter and Paul Fortress. Sukhomlinov remained at the fortress until he was transferred to a hospital in July. Polivanov accused him of abuse of power, in relation with the divorce of his wife, corruption, depositing millions of rubles at the Deutsche Bank in Berlin, and high treason after some of his close associates had been convicted for espionage on behalf of Germany (c.q. S. Myasoedov, A. Altschuller, V. Dumbadze, who was allowed to see documents in order to write a biography). Myasoedov, having an affair with Sukhumlinov's wife at the time, was arrested in Kovno and tried in Warsaw by a military court on 17 March and hanged the next day ). Responsibility for his being brought to trial was shared by Duke Mikhail Andronnikov, Alexander Guchkov, Alexander Khvostov and Alexander Alexandrovich Makarov. Sukhomlinov received a sentence of two years imprisonment. The third wife of Sukhomlinov was accused of having very extravagant tastes for clothes and furs. Like Alexandra, she had organized a hospital for wounded soldiers. One evening she organized a donation party using the name of the Tsarina to attract people. According to Mikhail Rodzianko, Sukhomlinov's wife had sought assistance from Grigori Rasputin and Peter Badmayev. After Rasputin had spoken to the Tsarina, she defended Sukhomlinov until she and Alexander Protopopov had him freed after six months and placed under house arrest. When Protopopov visited the former minister at his apartment, he was heavily criticized in the Duma.R.C. Moe, p. 447-448. It disgusted the public and injured the reputation of the government. Sukhomlinov was rearrested during the February Revolution and locked up in the same cold and humid cell at Peter and Paul Fortress as two years before, in addition to his wife and Anna Vyrubova who were also imprisoned there. His trial took place from 10 August through 12 September 1917. While acquitted of charges of treason, Sukhomlinov was found guilty of not using his power in the past to organize weapons and ammunition for the army. Sukhomlinov was sentenced to an open-ended katorga (as a librarian, printer and sweeper) on charges of leaving the army unprepared for World War I. For the first time in Russian jurisprudence history, a public jury was used for a political trial, organized in a military concert hall.Sukhomlinov, pp. 467, 486 After the fall of the Russian Provisional Government, Sukhomlinov had in prison the company of all the former ministers, others were Alexei Khvostov, Purishkevich, and Stepan Petrovich Beletsky. On May Day 1918, Sukhomlinov was released from prison shortly before reaching 70 years of age, and for a while kept himself hidden in an empty apartment. On 22 September, Sukhomlinov fled Russia and moved to Hanko in Finland (now independent from Russia) before moving again to Weimar Germany. In 1924, his memoirs appeared, dedicated to his former friends in the army and to Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, who considered reciprocating by dedicating his memoirs to Sukhomlinov. Highly critical of former colleagues, Sukhomlinov suggested that the Revolutions of 1917-1923 had occurred because Russia and Germany been unable to remain united against liberal democracy due to the breakup of the League of the Three Emperors and the war, and that monarchism could be restored through a rapprochement in Russian-German relations. Sukhomlinov's memoirs were published in translation by the newly- formed Soviet Union. Sukhomlinov lived the remainder of his life in extreme poverty in Berlin, where he was found dead of exposure on a park bench one morning on 2 February 1926. Sukhomlinov was buried at the Berlin-Tegel Russian Orthodox Cemetery. Works * As a journalist under the pseudonym Ostap Bondarenko; * Suchhomlinov, W.A. (1924) 'Erinnerungen'.

Early life Shaun Palmer (\\"Napalm\\") was born in South Lake Tahoe on November 14, 1968. From a young age, Shaun maintained a strong interest in all things fast. His mother told People Magazine in 1999 \\"Whether it was on wheels or on a board, it had to be superfast—he had no fear. I remember once when he was 13, I had grounded him. Well, he jumped out of his second-floor bedroom window, got on his bike and took off. He was like that—always pushing the limits.\\" While Palmer showed potential in both skiing and baseball, Shaun grew enamored with the still- infant sport of snowboarding. At the age of 12, Shaun built his own snowboard. Snowboarding career Palmer taught himself to snowboard, as he was never formally schooled in the sport. In an interview with People Magazine, Palmer stated: \\"I didn't watch tapes or study other guys—I just figured out what felt right.\\" Just three years after building his own board, Palmer dropped out of high school to become a professional snowboarder. Throughout his snowboarding career, Palmer received various accolades, including USA Today's World's Greatest Athlete, Details Magazine's Athlete of the Year in 1998, and the NEA Extreme Athlete of the Year in 2000. Also in 2000, Palmer was named as the inaugural Laureus World Alternative Sportsperson of the Year. In February 2001, Shaun Palmer was awarded the ESPY Awards' Action Sports Athlete of the Year. In 2006, Palmer earned himself a spot on the 2006 U.S. Olympic Snowboarding Team. Palmer was a long shot, qualifying for the team after an 11th-hour World Cup podium finish in Bad Gastein, Austria, just one month before the 2006 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately, Palmer tore his Achilles tendon just two weeks later, rendering him unable to represent the United States. In 2010, Shaun Palmer was left off the 2010 U.S. Olympic Snowboarding Team. Palmer had sought to fill the last spot on the 18-member squad, but was bumped in favor of Nick Baumgartner. Shaun would have been the oldest man to qualify for the Winter Olympics in history. Palmer Snowboards Palmer began Palmer Snowboards in 1995, as an offshoot of one of the most popular names in extreme sports. As per his Facebook page, Palmer Snowboards closed its U.S.-based office doors in 2008 and the brand is only available for purchase within Europe. Rumor is that a Swiss owner bought the brand with inheritance; as Palmer Snowboard's online shop is all in German language and an account to shop with can only be created with an address in Europe. Mountain biking In 1995, Palmer took up the sport of mountain biking, spending time around some of the sport's foremost authorities. Just one year later, Shaun began competing in the professional mountain biking circuit. Palmer shocked the mountain biking world by proving to be a more than worthy competitor. Shaun placed seventh in downhill at the second 1996 World Cup event of the year, before finishing second in downhill at the 1996 UCI World Championships, missing the top spot by just .15 seconds. Shaun threw his goggles down in frustration after finishing as he rolled through the finish area, showing his determination to obtain nothing but first The event drained Palmer, however he was quick to warn the 1996 champion Nicolas Vouilloz of France in a post race interview that after he gained some more fitness Shaun would soon be beating Vouilloz in the races. In the same interview Shaun was quick and humble to compliment Nicolas as the best rider in the world based on his record of wins. By the end of the biking season, Palmer was number five in the World Cup rankings and seventh in the NORBA National Championship Series. Palmer's debut year landed him a $300,000 annual contract with Mountain Dew Specialized Bicycles team, making Palmer the highest-paid mountain biker in the world. In the 1999 Mountain biking season, Palmer won the NORBA downhill championship in the dual slalom category. Motocross Palmer is a professional motocross racer. Palmer claims that motocross is his favorite sport, dubbing it \\"the best sport in the world.\\" In 2003, Shaun began his professional motocross career racing on the Supercross Tour. Palmer qualified for the tour on his first 125cc Supercross main event, an almost unheard of feat. Other achievements Between the snowboarding and mountain biking seasons, Palmer took up two new sports, reaching similar levels of success. In 1998, Palmer won the Toyota Celebrity Grand Prix auto race. His interest in auto racing continued, winning the Pike's Peak Hill Climb auto race in 2000 as well as the Jeep King of the Mountain championship in 2008. In 2001, Palmer went head to head with the world's best professional skiers, winning the Ski cross event at the 2001 Winter X Games, as well as the ski cross gold at the Gravity Games of the same year. Personal life Throughout the 1990s, Palmer was the lead singer of a punk band called Fungus. Palmer teamed up with Activision, publishers of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, to create Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. Palmer has suffered from admitted problems with both alcohol and drug addiction.

Since then, Cruywagen had presented the Afrikaans news on the SABC network every weeknight. His final broadcast on SABC 2 went out on 26 November 2012 at 7pm CAT. He has made approximately 7000 news broadcasts. Career He began his career as a journalist in 1965 when he started working part-time at the SABC in Cape Town, while studying at the University of Stellenbosch. He presented his first news bulletin on 26 November 1975 at 20:00 - the first story he read on that night was the sentencing of Breyten Breytenbach to nine years in jail. In June 2003, following an outcry over reports that Cruywagen's contract with the SABC would not be renewed, an agreement between the SABC and UASA (United Association of South Africa) was reached. His contract was renewed and it was announced that he would continue with his duties for a period of time. An unusual graffiti piece on a wall next to Kayamandi, Stellenbosch The name Riaan Cruywagen has become synonymous with Afrikaans television news through his lengthy career. In the mid-2000s, following the contract renewal issue, Cruywagen was once more the focus of popular culture in South Africa for a time, when a number of e-mail and internet jokes originally referring to Chuck Norris and David Hasselhoff were modified by using his name in their place. South African-themed jokes in a similar vein were also circulated, mostly related to his perennially youthful appearance and intellectual prowess. Cruywagen was also the voice artist for the character Haas Das on the popular Afrikaans children's news programme Haas Das se Nuuskas in 1976. He also voiced the character when it was revived in a movie Haas Das hou konsert (Hare Tie Holds A Concert) in 2007. He originally landed the job when he told the show's creator Louise Smit a joke. She grabbed him and screamed: \\"I've got my rabbit!\\". He also voiced numerous characters in another popular children's programme, \\"Liewe Heksie\\". He appeared in an ad-campaign for ATKV/Pendoring, as a waiter in a restaurant with a board on the wall saying: \\"Moenie die taal afskeep nie! (Don't neglect the language!)\\" - referring to Afrikaans. Cruywagen has appeared in a number of films, playing himself as a newsreader, including an appearance reading the news in Zulu in Leon Schuster's Sweet 'n Short. He was also seen in Stander as a nostalgic reminder of his long career as newsreader.

Most kinesins transport materials or cargo around the cell while traversing along microtubule polymer tracks with the help of ATP-hydrolysis-created energy. Structure They are easily identified by their three typical structural components including a highly conserved structural domain, catalytic core, and microtubule binding sites. The kinesin-13 family, unlike other kinesins, has an internally positioned motor domain. They were initially named KIF-M because of the unique location of their catalytic core in the middle of the polypeptide between the N-terminal globular domain and the C-terminal stalk but they are truly special due to their versatile nature. The Kinesin-13 family's molecular mechanism is less understood than other classes of kinesins which have their motor domains at one end of the molecule or the other. They are capable of traveling to both the minus and plus ends of microtubules whereas most motors are unidirectional. Thus they can catalytically depolymerize a microtubule from both ends making it a very efficient process. The exact mechanism of Kinesin-13 activated microtubule depolymerization remains unclear, however, recent biochemical and structural studies revealed some more detailed class specific features enabling researchers to formulate a model.) The protein first contacts the side wall of a microtubule. This is not a stable interaction because the convex surface of the catalytic core does not fit to the flat surface of the straight microtubule protofilament. Steric hindrance between the molecule neck and adjacent protofilament further inhibits full contact between protein and the microtubule and only facilitates one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule. At this time, The protein's nucleotide binding pocket is trapped in an open state so that the structure is not hydrolyzing ATP. Once the motor reaches the end of the microtubule, the protofilament spontaneously curves itself allowing motor to make full contact with the tubulin subunit. More MCAK molecules collectively bind to the curved region supporting the theory that they do not actively peel away the microtubule but they wait patiently for it to adopt this curved conformation. They stabilize the curved conformation by binding to the end of the microtubule and then catalyze depolymerization. Functions during mitosis The major function of mitosis is to separate replicated sister chromatids, and this is accomplished in part during anaphase A when \\"kinetochore microtubules (or kMTs)\\" that link the sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles shorten by depolymerization, exerting forces on the chromatids that pull them to the poles. In Drosophila there is evidence that sister chromatids are moved to opposite spindle poles by a \\"kinesin-13 dependent pacman-flux mechanism\\" in which one kinesin-13 isoform, KLP59c, localized to kinetochores facilitates the depolymerization of the end of the kMTs facing the chromatid (pacman), whereas a second kinesin-13 isoform, KLP10A, localized on the spindle poles facilitates the depolymerization of the opposite end of the kMTs facing the poles (flux)  See also  *KIF13A  References  External links  * Video Illustrations Category:Motor proteins ","title":"Kinesin 13"},{"id":"4138135","text":"Hunter, in Darkness is a 1999 interactive fiction game by Andrew Plotkin, written in Inform. It won the \\"Best Individual Puzzle\\" and \\"Best Setting\\" categories in the 1999 XYZZY Awards, and came in eighth overall in the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition. The game is inspired by Gregory Yob's seminal 1972 computer game Hunt the Wumpus. As in Hunt the Wumpus, the player's goal is to locate and defeat the title beast within its cave. However, Hunter, in Darkness emphasizes the setting, describing the cave in much greater detail than the earlier work. Plotkin states in the About section of the game: > \\"This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999.\\" And > it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes, and > whether \\"Hunt the Wumpus\\" was really IF, made me giggle. I already had this > on the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion, either -- > although I contributed a few comments that I knew would turn out relevant. The game features an experimental system of movement, being one of the few Interactive Fiction games where mapping is neither necessary nor useful. Instead of typing compass directions, players move between locations by following clues in their surroundings, such as sounds and locations of objects.
