Genealogy The ancestors of Siddi Lebbe were Arabs who settled in coastal Tamil Nadu and later penetrated into the Kandyan District. His father, Muhammad Lebbe Siddi Lebbe, was one of the first Ceylonese Proctors and was also the Head Moorman in 1833. Muhammad Cassim was also known as Siddi Lebbe. Early life Siddi Lebbe had an older brother named Muhammad Lebbe, an Arabic-educated Alim, under whose care he learnt to read Qur'an and study Tamil and English. Later he was admitted to the 'General Schooling' and educated in English. Establishments and services * In 1884, he pioneered the first Anglo- Mohammedan school at Colombo with the assistance of Orabi Pasha and Wapichie Marikkar. * In 1882, he introduced a madrasa called 'Madrasatul Zahira' in maradana, colombo. later in 1892 the 'madrasatul zahira 'became a school under the name of Zahira College. * Established schools in Kandy, Gampola, Polgahawela and Kurunegala. * Founded a Girls' school in Kandy. * Published the first Muslim journal Muslim Nesan in Tamil language on 12 December 1882. * Printed school text books and distributed them for free to students. * Established Siddhi Lebbe Maha Vidyalaya, Kandy His wide scheme of educating the Muslim community resulted in the establishment of Zahira College, patronised by the cream of the community due to the munificence of Wapchi Marikar. He also established many Tamil and Arabic Schools in many parts of the Central Province, some of which he himself managed and financed. In Kandy, he founded a Girls' School where his sister was the Head-Teacher. He studied the Arabic language to perfection and read many significant works of Islamic scholars and thereby excelled in religious knowledge surpassing that of the local Ulema of the time. The educational movement in Colombo, which he began with Wapchi Marikar, constantly required his presence in Colombo and thus he was compelled to live in Colombo paying occasional visits to his hometown in Kandy. Journals and Works *Muslim Friend, Muslim Nesan in English and Tamil, in order to educate his fellow Muslim community members. *Torch of Wishdom He also published a monthly journal called the \\"torch of Wisdom\\". He clamored to teach the Muslims their religion through these two journals where he urged the community to study the Arabic language. * Gjana Theepan in 1892 * Assan Beyudaya Kadhai (1885) Novel. * He also wrote and published Hidayathul Cassimiya. * Tuhuwathul Nahwa (key to grammar) * Shurut As Salat (observance of Prayer), Arabic Study Book Part I & II * History of the Turkish and Greek War * History of the Moors of Ceylon He used the medium of newspaper articles, books, and speeches to induce the Muslim community to make an attempt to uplift themselves from the backward condition they were in. Though numerous were his friends and admirers he did have his share of opponents too, who were not convinced of his understanding of the interpretation and philosophical understanding of Islam. Legacy Lebbe who was the father of Muslim education in Ceylon, a dynamic social worker and one who sacrificed everything he possessed to uplift the Muslim community culturally. Lebbe's writings, we are able even to this date, to have a glimpse of his character and capacity, his pious spirit and his penetrating intellect.

In a lattice L with bottom element 0, an element x ‚àà L is said to have a pseudocomplement if there exists a greatest element x* ‚àà L, disjoint from x, with the property that x ‚àß x* = 0. More formally, x* = max{ y ‚àà L  x ‚àß y = 0 }. The lattice L itself is called a pseudocomplemented lattice if every element of L is pseudocomplemented. Every pseudocomplemented lattice is necessarily bounded, i.e. it has a 1 as well. Since the pseudocomplement is unique by definition (if it exists), a pseudocomplemented lattice can be endowed with a unary operation * mapping every element to its pseudocomplement; this structure is sometimes called a p-algebra. However this latter term may have other meanings in other areas of mathematics. Properties In a p-algebra L, for all x, y ‚àà L: * The map x ‚Ü¶ x* is antitone. In particular, 0* = 1 and 1* = 0. * The map x ‚Ü¶ x** is a closure. * x* = x***. * (x‚à®y)* = x* ‚àß y*. * (x‚àßy)** = x** ‚àß y**. The set S(L) ‚âù { x**  x ‚àà L } is called the skeleton of L. S(L) is a ‚àß-subsemilattice of L and together with x ‚à™ y = (x‚à®y)** = (x* ‚àß y*)* forms a Boolean algebra (the complement in this algebra is *). In general, S(L) is not a sublattice of L. In a distributive p-algebra, S(L) is the set of complemented elements of L. Every element x with the property x* = 0 (or equivalently, x** = 1) is called dense. Every element of the form x ‚à® x* is dense. D(L), the set of all the dense elements in L is a filter of L. A distributive p-algebra is Boolean if and only if D(L) = {1}. Pseudocomplemented lattices form a variety.  Examples  * Every finite distributive lattice is pseudocomplemented. * Every Stone algebra is pseudocomplemented. In fact, a Stone algebra can be defined as a pseudocomplemented distributive lattice L in which any of the following equivalent statements hold for all x, y ‚àà L: ** S(L) is a sublattice of L; ** (x‚àßy)* = x* ‚à® y*; ** (x‚à®y)** = x** ‚à® y**; ** x* ‚à® x** = 1. * Every Heyting algebra is pseudocomplemented. * If X is a set, the open set topology on X is a pseudocomplemented (and distributive) lattice with the meet and join being the usual union and intersection of open sets. The pseudocomplement of an open set A is the interior of the set complement of A. Furthermore, the dense elements of this lattice are exactly the dense open subsets in the topological sense.  Relative pseudocomplement  A relative pseudocomplement of a with respect to b is a maximal element c such that a‚àßc‚â§b. This binary operation is denoted a‚Üíb. A lattice with the pseudocomplement for each two elements is called implicative lattice, or Brouwerian lattice. In general case, an implicative lattice may not have a minimal element, if such element exists, then pseudocomplement a* could be defined using relative pseudocomplement as a ‚Üí 0.

Apart from its theme of finding love, its principal theme was emigration. The action centered principally in the Azores, but also included segments in Canada and continental Portugal. Principal photography began in January 2007, and filming in the Azores continued until August 2008. Production During the telenovela, the story centres on the tragic protagonists Beatriz Machado da C√¢mara (Sofia Nicholson) and Jaime Valente (Adriano Luz) who perish on the first episode of the series. The story's protagonists, therefore, become their two eldest children Clara Machado da C√¢mara (Sofia Alves) and Tom√© Valente (Marco d'Almeida). =Conception= Initially the production was conceived and produced under the provisionary title Projeto A√ßores (Project Azores). Premiering on 26 March 2007 in prime- time, this episode was seen by almost 1.9 million Portuguese (or 19.7% of the average audience), being the best result in six-years to date. On 26 September 2008, the first Gala da Fic√ß√£o Nacional, organized by Portuguese television channel TVI, was held. During the four hours, 40 actors were remembered and honoured from decades of programming. Prior to the nights events, an audience poll was carried out to determine the favourite telenovela on Portuguese television. From a pool of 28 telenovelas listed, five were selected and finally, the Ilha dos Amores was selected by viewers. Carlos C√©sar, president of the regional government, donated 350,000 Euros to the telenovela production team, in order to promote regional tourism. In addition, the regional airline SATA provided 600 flights between Lisbon-Ponta Delgada-Lisbon, for a period of ten months to support the production team. Another 175 inter-island flights, as well as connections between Lisbon and Toronto were also completed between January and August. Filming was also supported by the local authorities of Vila Franca do Campo, Povoa√ß√£o, Lagoa, Nordeste and Ribeira Grande, who helped in scouting and setup for scenes in squares, gardens, parks, ports and buildings. The freighter that took Jaime from Ponta Delgada to Canada in the first episode, was CGI: the design was made in 3D and finalized in post- production. Four professionals recruited from France travelled to the island of S√£o Miguel, in order to film the accident that caused the death of Jaime and Beatriz. The accident was filmed on the road atop of the Sete Cidades massif, overlooking the Lagoa das Sete Cidades, at the scenic overlook of Vista do Rei. =Music= The series resulted in a soundtrack of popular songs, headlined by Can√ß√£o do Mar, a version by Diana Basto, and adapted from the popular version of Dulce Pontes. #Can√ß√£o do Mar - Diana Basto #Mariana - Lu√≠s Represas (Mariana's Theme) #P√°ssaro Azul - Andr√© Sardet (Tom√©'s Theme) #The Moment You Believe - Melanie C (Mariana and Miguel's Theme) #Ref√∫gio - Pedro Khima (Tobias's Theme) #Tr√™s Vidas - Ritual Tejo (Andr√©'s Theme) #Sentimento - Rita Guerra (Cec√≠lia's Theme) #Sei Que Sabes Que Sim - EZ Special (Miguel's Theme) #Ilumina-me - Pedro Abrunhosa (Clara and Tom√©'s Theme) #Na Mar√© De Ti - Gil do Carmo (Carlota and Rui's Theme) #Meu Cora√ß√£o Abandonado - Viviane (Glorinha's Theme) #Palavras Minhas - Carlos Martins e Carlos do Carmo (Henrique's Theme) #Ca√ßador de S√≥is - Ala Namorados (JP's Theme) #As Cores do C√©u - Lu√≠s Alberto Bettencourt #Ilha dos Amores - Paula Teixeira (Theme of the Azores) #Vida Pro√≠bida - S√©pia (Lu√≠sa's Theme) #Tudo Ou Nada (Ser Melhor) - Gutto (Carmo's Theme) #Perigo e Sedu√ß√£o - Sofia Gaspar (Madalena's Theme) #J√° Se Sabe - Nuno Brito (Gil's Theme) In addition to: *Por Ti Corri Pelo Mundo, Ricardo Moraes *Outro Futuro, Balla *N√£o mexas no tempo, Andr√© Sardet/Viviane *Por ti, vou de romeiro, Luis Alberto Bettencourt =Plot= Beginning in 1977, in the civil parish of Ponta Gar√ßa, on the island of S√£o Miguel, the story has its basis in the relationship between Jaime Valente (Hugo Tavares) and Beatriz Machado da C√¢mara (Vera Kolodzig), who were childhood sweethearts. Jaime is a poor farmer's son and Beatriz the wealthy heiress to a fortune, but secretly (over time) they begin a clandestine romance under fear of her family. Jaime and Beatriz eventually decide to runaway to Canada, after her family discovers their intentions. But, her family threatens Jaime's imprisonment under trumped-up charges of kidnapping minors. Jaime therefore escapes to Canada by himself, while Beatriz promises to join him when she becomes legal age. Each writes letters of their dreams and future intentions, but, neither receive these letters. They are convinced that each has forgotten the other. Then, Beatriz receives a visit from Alice (Adriana Moniz), who states that she is carrying Jaime's child, and was convinced of his \\"betrayal\\". Behind this intrigue was Henrique Medeiros (Rui Drummond), a neighbour and would-be pretendant to Beatriz. It was Henrique who had informed the Machado da C√¢mara clan of Jaime and Beatriz's elopement, and who paid Alice to lie about her pregnancy. But, Henrique's motives were never realized, as Beatriz eventually married another. Jaime continued to wait for letters that never arrived, until he eventually heard that Beatriz had married. Yet, determined to seek his dreams, he continued to work hard and raised a fortune, established a family with an Azorean immigrant. Both Beatriz and Jaime decided to forget their young loves. But, 30 years later, their lives and positions had changed. Jaime becomes a millionaire and Beatriz's family in bankruptcy. Fruit of failed business ventures, Beatriz's principal income comes from her family's plantation and tea factory. A widow, with three daughters Clara Machado da C√¢mara (Sofia Alves), M√≥nica Machado da C√¢mara (Diana Chaves) e Mariana Machado da C√¢mara (Joana Solnado), her future is bleak. Against his son's and second wife's protests, Jaime decides to return to S√£o Miguel, in order to manage his business interests. In the intervening years, Jaime had anonymously purchased the lands of the Machado da C√¢mara clan, and was preparing to purchase the bank holding the loans of the family, as well. Awash in debt, Beatriz accepts the sale of the properties and sets a meeting with the unknown Canadian investor to make a proposal. On the day of the meeting, Jaime and Beatriz encounter in the street. But, it is a tragic encounter: their cars collide and fall off a cliff into a deep ravine. Both die. Clara, Beatriz's daughter and Tom√© Valente (Marco D'Almeida), son of Jaime (both 28) recognize the other in the cemetery, and immediately hate the other. Tom√© is aggressive, cold and powerful businessman, and swears revenge on the beautiful, intelligent and unresigned adversary. These events introduce the historical conflicts within the story, and occur in the first few episodes of the series. =Story= Clara and Tom√© eventually build a love-hate relationship that extends throughout the series. Along with these are Miguel Valente (Carloto Cotta) and Mariana, their younger siblings, who also develop relationships with their opposite. Throughout the series these protagonists fall in and out of love, build conflicts and establish truces, just to be reunited. Miguel and Mariana are opposites and are manipulated by Anabela Santos (Joana Santos), who attempts to separate the young couple for the Valente family fortune. Similarly, Miguel and Tom√©'s step-mother who married Jaime for his money, continues to play a puppet-master along with Henrique Medeiros. Cast and characters Among the actors who declined to participate in the telenovela were: Ana Padr√£o, Dina F√©lix da Costa, Eunice Mu√±oz, H√©lio Pestana, Irene Cruz, Joana Figueira, Joaquim Horta, Lu√≠s Louren√ßo, M√°rcia Leal, Paula Lobo Antunes, Paulo Pires, Ricardo Carri√ßo, Rita Lopes and Sara Barradas. Eunice Mu√±oz, who could not accept a casting as Maria Am√©lia Machado da C√¢mara (which was given to Elisa Lisboa) due to other professional responsibilities, later joined the cast as Em√≠lia, a homeless woman who became the friend of Mariana. Joana Solnado became one of the more accomplished actresses of her generation, in her role as Mariana Machado da C√¢mara, with her characterization of a traumatized young woman. Similarly, Ant√≥nio Capelo, took on the monstrous role as the evil protagonist Henrique Medeiros. Both provided interpretations that marked their careers. Many of the actors involved in the series came from the novela Tempo de Viver, including Joana Solnado, Manuela Couto, Marco D'Almeida, Marco Delgado and Sofia Nicholson. Other actors graduated from the series Tempo de Viver, such as Jos√© Wallenstein, Manuel Wiborg and Pedro Teixeira. Reception =Ratings= The first episode of Ilha dos Amores, was the third-most viewed fiction series on TVI, with Filha do Mar being second, and A Outra the most viewed. The telenovela was repeated in 2011 by TVI during the lunchtime hour. This repeat allowed TVI to take the leadership of the slot, then dominated by RTP1 and SIC.

In January 2008, Tornado, Claudio Castagnoli, and Eddie Kingston defeated LeRae, Hero, and Necro Butcher in a six-person match, which meant that LeRae was forced to face Tornado in a singles match the following night. LeRae lost the match by disqualification when Hero, who was banned from ringside, came to the ring to aid her. LuFisto entered the feud in March when she teamed with Tornado in a loss to LeRae and Hero. The following night, LeRae defeated LuFisto in a singles match.

In July, she was announced as one of the participants for the Mae Young Classic tournament. LeRae defeated Renee Michelle in the first round and Nicole Savoy in the second round, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Shayna Baszler. On January 16, 2018, WWE announced that LeRae had signed a contract with the company. Shortly after, LeRae was inserted into her husband Johnny Gargano's feud with then-NXT Champion Andrade \\"Cien\\" Almas and his manager Zelina Vega as an equaliser from Vega's interferences and attacks during their matches. This led to a match between the two on the April 18 episode of NXT, where LeRae scored her first victory as part of the brand. Two weeks later, now working as an active competitor, LeRae suffered her first loss as she was unable to defeat Bianca Belair. In July, LeRae competed against Kairi Sane and Nikki Cross in a triple-threat match number one contender's match, which was eventually won by Sane. After a few months of investigation, it was revealed that Gargano was the mystery attacker of Aleister Black, a storyline in which Nikki Cross was the witness. This sparked a match between LeRae and Cross, where LeRae was defeated. After a short hiatus, in what was her first appearance on the main roster, LeRae competed in her first women's Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, entering at number 17 and lasting 09:35 minutes, before being eliminated by Ruby Riott.

It is 3.45 mi (5.5 km) from the northern to southern ends, making its length-to-width ratio roughly 1:6. The lake is known for its pine coasts, irregular shoreline, and many peninsulas and islands, despite being smaller in size. Its maximum depth is 96.0 feet, making it the 2nd deepest lake in Grand Traverse County. Two smaller lakes sit to the north of Silver Lake: Mud Lake & Hidden Lake. Today, houses and parks surround the lake. Many larger houses have been built around the northern and eastern shores of the lake.  History and Geography  Silver Lake was originally named Lake Kratochvil, after the small nearby town called Kratochvil's Plat (which is now a ghost town), itself named after Frank Kratochvil, a local settler. Frank's daughter, Anna, was the mother of W.D.C. Germaine, mayor of nearby Traverse City. The lake was later named Silver Lake. Until sometime in the early 1900s, Blair Township was apparently known as \\"Silver Lake Township\\" In 1965, the Silver Lake Improvement Association was established to promote the care and preservation of Silver Lake. In 1987, the Grand Traverse County Drain Commission installed a high water outflow dam at Kevwitch Cove (the southernmost end of the lake), which was at the beginning of Beitner Creek. The largest nearby towns are Grawn, Chums Corner, and Traverse City. Its water flows in from the north end of the lake and out of the south end. The water flows through the dam and into the Silver Lake Outlet and Beitner Creek (the outflow of nearby Bass Lake), through Blair Township, and into the Boardman River and out to Lake Michigan.  Fishing and Recreation  Silver Lake is a local hotspot for fishing. It is known for its Bass, Bluegill, Perch, Pike, Lake sunfish, and Walleye. There is a public dock used for launching boats on the eastern shore of the lake. The Silver Lake Recreation Area is a park for people of all ages, and is located northeast of the lake. Holiday Park Campground is a large public campground on the southern end of the lake, just off of US 31. It has boat access and has camping lots on Tent Island, which it owns as property. Annually, there are regattas and fishing competitions on the lake. The lake is popular in winter with ice fishers.

Recursive neural networks, sometimes abbreviated as RvNNs, have been successful, for instance, in learning sequence and tree structures in natural language processing, mainly phrase and sentence continuous representations based on word embedding. RvNNs have first been introduced to learn distributed representations of structure, such as logical terms. Models and general frameworks have been developed in further works since the 1990s.  Architectures  = Basic = A simple recursive neural network architecture In the most simple architecture, nodes are combined into parents using a weight matrix that is shared across the whole network, and a non-linearity such as tanh. If c1 and c2 are n-dimensional vector representation of nodes, their parent will also be an n-dimensional vector, calculated as p_{1,2} = \\\\tanh\\\\left(W[c_1 ; c_2]\\\\right) Where W is a learned n\\\\times 2n weight matrix. This architecture, with a few improvements, has been used for successfully parsing natural scenes and for syntactic parsing of natural language sentences. = Recursive cascade correlation (RecCC) = RecCC is a constructive neural network approach to deal with tree domains with pioneering applications to chemistry and extension to directed acyclic graphs. = Unsupervised RNN = A framework for unsupervised RNN has been introduced in 2004. = Tensor = Recursive neural tensor networks use one, tensor-based composition function for all nodes in the tree.  Training  = Stochastic gradient descent = Typically, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used to train the network. The gradient is computed using backpropagation through structure (BPTS), a variant of backpropagation through time used for recurrent neural networks.  Properties  Universal approximation capability of RNN over trees has been proved in literature.  Related models  = Recurrent neural networks = Recurrent neural networks are recursive artificial neural networks with a certain structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current time step. = Tree Echo State Networks = An efficient approach to implement recursive neural networks is given by the Tree Echo State Network within the reservoir computing paradigm. = Extension to graphs = Extensions to graphs include Graph Neural Network (GNN), Neural Network for Graphs (NN4G), and more recently convolutional neural networks for graphs.

The watershed neighbors of Windigo River are: * on the east side: that of the Jolie River (south) and that of the Pierriche River (north) including its tributary the River Pierriche west; * on the west side: Saint-Maurice River. Several small lakes are the headwaters of the Windigo River including: \\"lac de la hauteur\\" (Lake of Height) and \\"lac du Pigamon\\" (Lake Pigamon). Lakes heads are surrounded by mountains with peaks reaching up to 2150 feet. Coming down from the mountains, the water of the river pass through some lakes, including: l'Abb√© (the Abbot), de l'Adiante (the Maidenhair), Wilfried, Windigo, Wageguma and Compass. At 2.5 km before its mouth, Windigo river turns west. The river empties into the Reservoir Blanc in front of the hamlet \\"Windigo\\" (located on the west side of Saint-Maurice River). The Reservoir Blanc is an artificial enlargement of the Saint-Maurice River because of the dam Rapide-Blanc. The mouth of the Windigo River is at 6 km upstream of the bend of the Saint- Maurice River, located near the hamlet McTavish. Tributaries of Windigo River The main tributaries of the Windigo river are (from the mouth): * West side: streams \\"Two and a Half Mile\\", \\"des Cinq milles\\" (Five Miles), Windigo River west, creeks Coulombe, Spartan streams, northwest Windigo River and Kennedy Creek; * East side: streams Veillette, Doucet, Arsenault Creek, Wapposening, B√©dard, \\"du Chasseur\\" (Hunter), Nastapolk, Hilda (from Lake Hilda) Cabeloga River and \\"Gen√©vrier\\" (Juniper).

Windigo West River has several waterfalls and rapids, while collecting water from several lakes in wilderness. Windigo Northwest River The Jamme Lake (located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan) is the header Lake of the Windigo northwest river. This river is on south of Kennedy Creek watershed and flows south-east to go spilling into the Windigo River. Windigo northwest river drains water many lakes, including: Nancy, Iris, Julien, Round, Flow, \\"aux Grenouilles\\" (the Frogs), No√´l (Christmas), \\"De la Boucane\\", Gros Buck and Partage.

The Railway Canadian National between La Tuque and Senneterre passes through the hamlet. The Postal Service has operated a post office Windigo between 1921 and 1964. In De Ker-Is in Quebec (1990), Fernand Grenier wrote that in Algonquin peoples and the Cree language, the Windigo (or Wendigo) is a powerful cannibal fabulous monster, giant, sometimes. Possessed by evil spirit, crazy, Windigo has to be slaughtered at the first opportunity. The same term is used when you want to settle down children: it is then a kind of bogeyman or fellow Sept Heures! In the Quebec language, \\"from the Windigo\\" usually means moving away in the woods, go to the sites or run the adventure in remote and often disreputable places\\". The Abenaki denote the river Kiwakwazibo or the giant river and Attikameks know him as Witiko Sipi river monster.

Life He was born in Galveston, Texas, the son of Rebecca Prince Jackson and Louis Jones, Sr. He began singing with his mother in their church choir, and learned to play piano and drums. After attending Central High School in Galveston, he served as a medic with the US Army during the Korean war under the name Louis Prince, and worked as a longshoreman and shipyard worker. In the early 1950s he moved to Houston to live with his brother, and soon began singing backing vocals on recordings produced by Don Robey at Peacock Records. Jones made his first recording, \\"Rock and Roll Bells\\", for Peacock in 1956. Billboard described the song as \\"a new R&B; gimmick that should occasion a lot of interest. The shouter hears tinkling bells and acts as if he is going mad. The unusual backing carries the spirit thru effectively...\\" The record was one of the 26 discs included in Elvis Presley's first record collection, sold at auction in 2010. Jones also worked as a backup singer on many of Robey's productions for the Peacock and Duke labels in the late 1950s, including recordings by Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland and \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton. He performed and toured with the Bobby Scott Orchestra, and sang back-up for singer Maxine Brown, playing in New York City and in a residency in Bermuda. His recording career continued in the early 1960s. When in New York in 1963 he recorded \\"The Birds Is Coming\\" for Decca Records - adopting the movie company's advertising slogan for Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds - and also recorded a version of Ray Charles' \\"I Believe to My Soul\\", on Bobby Robinson's Enjoy label. Returning to Texas, he recorded his own songs \\"Come on Home\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Fool\\" for Lelan Rogers' Houston-based Sabra label. Jones was married twice. He died in 1984 at the age of 53, following a stroke the previous year, and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Galveston.

From 1943 to 1960 he was chief music critic of The Times. From his student days Howes gravitated towards criticism as his musical specialism, guided by the advice of the conductor and professor Sir Hugh Allen and the critic H C Colles. Howes was known for his affinity with English music in the tradition of the \\"English Musical Renaissance\\"; after 1945 he found the less nationalistic, more cosmopolitan nature of post-war composers uncongenial. In addition to his work for The Times, Howes wrote fifteen books, and served on many musical committees for bodies including the BBC and the Arts Council. Life and career Howes was born in Oxford, and was educated at Oxford High School and St John's College, where his love of music was developed under the tutelage of Sir Hugh Allen.\\"Mr Frank Howes\\", The Times, 30 September 1974, p. 17 After the First World War, in which he was conscripted into the Non- Combatant Corps,\\"Frank Stewart Howes\\", Lives of the First World War, Imperial War Museum, retrieved 15 January 2016 he was admitted to the Royal College of Music, where, guided by H. C. Colles, he specialised in musical criticism. In 1925, Colles, who was chief music critic of The Times, recruited Howes to his staff. In 1938, Howes took on the additional duties of lecturer at the Royal College, and was later an extramural lecturer at Oxford and Glasgow Universities. When Colles died in 1943, Howes was appointed his successor. Among Howes' enthusiasms was English folk music and, from 1927 to 1945, he edited the journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. He supported the theory that Sir Hubert Parry and Sir Charles Villiers Stanford led an \\"English Musical Renaissance\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from which composers not from a Royal College elite were excluded.Eatock, Colin (2010). \\"The Crystal Palace Concerts: Canon Formation and the English Musical Renaissance\\". 19th-Century Music, 34 (1), pp. 87‚Äì105; and Onderdonk, Julian. \\"The English Musical Renaissance, 1860‚Äì1940: Construction and Deconstruction,\\" Notes: Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association, September 1995, pp. 63‚Äì66 His obituarist in The Times considered that of Howes' 15 books, it was the 1966 The English Musical Renaissance that meant most to him. According to his fellow critic Martin Cooper, Howes' affinity with music in the \\"English Renaissance\\" tradition left him out of sympathy with the increasingly cosmopolitan outlook of those British composers who emerged after the Second World War. Among Howes' other books were studies of William Byrd, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Sir William Walton. In addition to his authorial career, he was active in behind-the-scenes musical work, as president of the Royal Musical Association (1947‚Äì58), chairman of the Musicians' Benevolent Fund (1936‚Äì55); and member of music advisory panels for the BBC, the Arts Council and the British Council. Howes married Barbara Tidd Pratt in 1928; the couple had a son and three daughters. He died at Standlake, Oxfordshire, at the age of 83.

The walls are preserved up to approximately a meter in height and 4 meters in thickness. Abutting the broch to the west is a small building annex measuring 8 meters by 5 meters. The original entrance to the broch is unknown, though it is thought that a partially exposed lintel slab may indicate that the entrance was in the west wall. North of the possible entrance is a short stretch of a base course of stones, and there are further potential wall remains adjacent to the access way. West of the broch and annex is a natural ditch that is thought to have been part of the brochs defence. On the other three sides the broch was protected by steep rock slopes. In addition to the ditch there are also remains of an outer wall on the west side, though the poor state of preservation makes it difficult to assess the extent of this defensive wall.

Establishment in Ville-Marie Prud'homme was one of the original settlers in Fort Ville-Marie (now Montreal), arriving in 1641 in the mission led by Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, receiving thirty acres of land outside the fort in October 1650.. In November 1650 Prud‚Äôhomme married Roberte Gadoys (1621‚Äì1716), daughter of Pierre Gadoys, recognized as the first farmer of Montreal. Also in 1650 Prud'homme established the first commercial brewery in New France, located outside the fortification of Fort Ville-Marie. The brewery survived, in a wood building, survived multiple attempts by the Iroquois to burn it down. Prud'homme received further grants of land in 1654, 1662, and 1666.. Involvement in Civic Affairs Prud'homme's original land grant adjoined that of Michel Chauvin, just outside the fort. Earlier in 1650, Prud'homme discovered on a trip to France that Chauvin was a bigamist, having married Louise Delisle on 10 August 1637 in Ste-Suzanne, Mayenne, France and subsequently Anne Archambault, daughter of Jacques Archambault, on July 27, 1647 in Paroisse Notre Dame, Qu√©bec, a celebration Prud'homme had attended. Prud'homme informed Governor Chomedy of this fact, which led to Chauvin's banishment from Ville-Marie and the annulment of his marriage to Anne Archambault.. In 1657, priests from the Society of Saint-Sulpice - known as \\"the Sulpicians\\", took over in Ville-Marie from the Jesuits. Prud‚Äôhomme was elected as one of the first three churchwardens of the parish of Notre-Dame. In 1663, he is recorded as a corporal of a section in the newly constituted militia of the Holy Family. In 1664 he and four other colonists were elected as police magistrates, but the authorities of New France refused to confirm the results of the election as they viewed the police court as too democratic..

The vessel primarily saw action in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. The ship was named for the Ettrick Water in Scotland. Ettrick was ordered 1 June 1941 as part of the River-class building programme. The vessel was laid down on 31 December 1941 by John Crown & Sons at Sunderland and launched 25 February 1943. The ship was one of six frigates of the class to be fitted with steam turbines instead of the standard reciprocating machinery. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 11 July 1943. War service =Royal Navy= After commissioning and trials, Ettrick was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) as a convoy escort. From Dec 1943 to Mar 1944, she was commanded by Lt Cdr Nicholas Monsarrat, who later depicted her as \\"HMS River\\" in his 1946 novel H. M. Frigate. The ship was initially assigned to escort group C-1, a Canadian-commanded group. In January 1944 she put in at Halifax, Nova Scotia to undergo a refit. While there she was turned over to the Royal Canadian Navy. =Royal Canadian Navy= On 29 January 1944, while undergoing a refit at Halifax, Ettrick was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy. Once the refit was completed, the vessel was assigned to MOEF escort group C-3. She made two round trips to Derry with the group before transferring out to join escort group 27 based out of Halifax. On 14 January 1945, she rammed during the defence of convoy BX 141, damaging the submarine's conning tower. The submarine however was able to escape. The ship remained as a local escort until the end of hostilities in Europe. She returned to the United Kingdom in May and was returned to the Royal Navy on 30 May 1945. Postwar service Following the vessel's return to the Royal Navy, she was converted to a combined operations headquarters ship. The ship however was never recommissioned into the fleet and saw no service in her new capability. In April 1946 Ettrick was laid up at Harwich. The vessel was broken up in 1953 at Grays.

He was an important figure in the 1950s descarga (jam session) scene in Havana, and one of the most influential Cuban pianists of the 20th century.  Biography  = Early life and career = Pedro J√∫stiz was born in Banes, Holgu√≠n, on January 31, 1913 into a family of local musicians. Taught by his mother since 1923, he soon learned to play the piano and joined the family band La Rechiva del Son, directed by his uncles. In 1928 he moved to Antilla to study piano and saxophone under the supervision of his grandfather, Emilio Rodr√≠guez.Peruch√≠n J√∫stiz, EcuRed. In 1933, his family moved to Santiago de Cuba. In Santiago, Peruch√≠n had to give up the saxophone due to his asthma, so he concentrated on piano. In the mid-1930s he debuted with Orquesta Chep√≠n-Chov√©n, where he would alternate on piano with director Bernardo Chov√©n. In 1940, he joined Los Trovadores del Tono, where he met Jos√© \\"Chombo\\" Silva and encouraged him to take up the saxophone. Silva would become a successful saxophonist and violinist in the New York salsa scene. Los Trovadores del Tono was directed by drummer Aurelio Mir√≥ Jr., who shortly after moved to Havana, as did Peruch√≠n and other members of the band. In Havana, Peruch√≠n worked occasionally with Orquesta Casino de la Playa and Mariano Mercer√≥n's orchestra. In 1942 he joined Los Swing Boys, a big band directed by saxophonist Emilio Pe√±alver and featuring Jos√© \\"Chombo\\" Silva. He then became a member of the Conjunto Matamoros, an expanded version of the Trio Matamoros. In 1943 he joined Armando Romeu's Tropicana Club orchestra. He rejected an offer by Mario Bauz√° to replace Joe Loco in his band, The Afrocubans, and instead recommended Ren√© Hern√°ndez. = Panama and back in Cuba = Between 1944 and 1949 he lived in Panama, where he played in Carlos Boza's band, frequently performing in clubs and radio stations. After returning to Havana he joined Julio Guti√©rrez's orchestra at the Teatro Campoamor. He then formed a duo with double bassist Alfredo Le√≥n before joining the popular Orquesta Riverside. He then arranged for singer Olga Guillot and was the pianist in Benny Mor√©'s Banda Gigante during the year 1953. Playing with the Riverside did not prevent him from performing with various ensembles, including descarga sessions with Julio Guti√©rrez (Panart's Cuban Jam Session), Chico O'Farrill, Emilio Pe√±alver, and Antobal's Cuban All- Stars. He also directed his own ensembles into the 1960s, releasing LPs such as Piano con mo√±a (recorded in March 1958). He eventually left Orquesta Riverside, focusing on his jazz groups. He formed a trio with Alberto Limonta on double bass and Rodolfo Casti√±eira on drums and percussion. He occasionally played in the Club Cubano de Jazz with musicians such as bassist Cachao and drummer Walfredo de los Reyes. He also worked with bassist Cacha√≠to and drummer Tibo Lee. = Later years and death = Peruch√≠n faded from the forefront of the Cuban jazz scene in the second half of the 1960s, giving way to up-and-coming figures such as Chucho Vald√©s. Since 1972, he sometimes replaced Frank Emilio Flynn in his band Quinteto Instrumental de M√∫sica Moderna (also known as Los Amigos), featuring Cacha√≠to on bass, Guillermo Barreto on drums and Tata G√ºines on congas. In 1975 he released his last album Piano y ritmo. On December 24, 1977, he died in Havana.  Style  Peruch√≠n's style was characterized by the frequent use of block chords, as heard in \\"Peruchineando\\", influencing notable pianists such as Charlie Palmieri, George Shearing, Eddie Palmieri, Papo Lucca,Lechner, Alfredo (April 11, 2012). \\"Peruch√≠n, un tesoro redescubierto\\".

His frantic way of concatenating guajeos gave rise to a neologism: peruchinear. Such style has been said to combine a \\"percussive\\" right hand with a \\"swinging\\" left hand.

Tabqa was the last bastion for Syrian military forces in Raqqa province, which at the end of the battle came fully under the control of the ISIL.  Early engagements  Around 10 August 2014, ISIL started to continuously attack Tabqa Airbase. On 17 August, the Syrian Air Force launched 26 airstrikes on Raqqa city and around Tabqa, killing at least 31 ISIL fighters and wounding dozens. At least eight civilians were also killed and ten wounded. At the same time the army launched an equal number of airstrikes in Deir Ez-zor against ISIL positions, bringing the total number of airstrikes to 40. The following day the Syrian Air Force launched another 20 airstrikes against ISIS positions, one of which destroyed the Raqqa city water plant, cutting off water supply to the city. According to Al Rai reporter Elijah J. Magnier, the Syrian Air Force used guided missiles following U.S. intel on ISIS gatherings. According to an anonymous source, the U.S. and an unidentified Western country provided the Syrian military with lists of ISIS targets acquired through drone intelligence. Meanwhile, the Syrian army sent reinforcements to Tabqa Airbase, and strengthened fortifications inside the base. It also supplied its garrison with large quantities of ammunition and food.  Ramped-up fights  On the night of 19 August the heaviest fighting yet occurred at Tabqa air base, which involved medium and heavy weaponry as well as 15 government air raids around Tabqa. ISIL had captured a string of nearby villages in the days before the attack, tightening its siege on the base. The assault started with a double suicide bombing near the entrance to the base, followed by a large-scale ground assault that consisted of 200 fighters, half of whom were foreigners. The next morning, fighting subsided after the first assault wave failed to breach the base, but a second wave was launched in the afternoon. ISIL fighters encountered a minefield, heavy shelling and air strikes throughout the assaults. The mines were reportedly planted as part of an ambush set up by Syrian army Special Forces based on previous observation of ISIS troop movements in the area. The fighting for the base continued until the morning of 22 August, as ISIS managed to capture the al-Tayyara checkpoint near the air base, but failed to break into the base itself. The base was reinforced with additional troops by plane overnight while there were still clashes. The SOHR reported that no more than 70 ISIS fighters were killed in the previous two days, since the attack on the base started, and denied other reported death tolls. According to the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV, over 150 ISIS fighters were killed in the ambush near the base, while the Al Masdar news site reported more than 200 ISIS fighters being killed in the previous two days, including the ISIS field commander Umar Abdel-Rahman, a Tunisian. According to Al Masdar, 14 soldiers were killed and 29 others wounded between 18‚Äì22 August. On the evening of 22 August and following arrival of reinforcements, ISIL launched a third attempt to breach the base, starting with a suicide bombing against the airport gate. The attack was repelled, while airstrikes also hit ISIS positions in the nearby city of Tabqa. According to Al-Masdar, a Syrian army brigade later captured the M-42 highway leading to the city of Salamiyah in Hama Governorate and ended the ISIS siege on the Tabqa air base.  Retreat and collapse  On 24 August ISIS fighters breached Tabqa and took control over large parts of the air base. This attack occurred when the army was already retreating from the base to the Ithriya area, leaving a small garrison behind. The base was eventually captured that day. According to Elijah J. Magnier, ISIS destroyed a MiG-21 fighter jet, while 15 other MiG-21s and all helicopters were evacuated from the base. The SOHR also confirmed all military aircraft were evacuated from the base during the retreat, while according to Charles Lister (Brookings Doha Center) ISIS captured a number of MiG-21B's, SA-16 MANPADS and Atoll missiles in the base, but noted that it was unclear whether the MiG-21Bs were at all operational. In the final assault 170 soldiers were killed, while since the start of the battle 346 ISIS fighters and 195 soldiers had been killed. The number of dead soldiers was later updated to 200. Another 150 soldiers were reportedly captured, while 700 soldiers managed to retreat.  Post battle's engagements  The next day jet fighters launched seven airstrikes on the surroundings of the air base. According to the SOHR, ISIS captured the al- Ajrawi farm nearby. It also reported that the ISIS prevented vehicles entering and leaving Raqqa province for fear of Syrian soldiers being transported out of the province. On 27 August ISIS captured more than 20 soldiers in the farmlands of Tabqa, while 27 soldiers and eight ISIS fighters were killed in fighting at the Athraya checkpoint in eastern Hama countryside. Sixty soldiers who were hiding near the Athraya area managed to reach Salamiyah. On 28 August Syrian fighter jets launched a precise attack on an IS HQ in the city of Mohasan, during a meeting between military leaders and sharia judges. The attack resulted in the deaths of most leaders inside (numbering six), while others were wounded. Another airstrike occurred the same day against an IS camp near Baath Dam, killing and wounding dozens of insurgents.  Mass execution of POWs  According to SOHR, ISIS executed at least 160 Syrian soldiers captured at the air base between 27‚Äì28 August. Joseph Adams at Syria Direct identified the execution site 300 meters northeast of Ma'amal Al- Qarmeed, approximately 5 km east of Raqqa.syriadirect.org/ Following the executions, Douraid al-Assad, cousin of Bashar al-Assad, demanded the resignation of the Syrian Defence Minister, Fahd Jassem al-Freij.

The slogan was coined by the BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, with the intention of conveying that a prosperous future was in store for India if the BJP came into power. After the BJP's historical victory in that election, sayings that include the words acche din (\\"good days\\") have been used both to express optimism in or critically discuss the Modi government.  Slogan  The slogan \\"Good days are coming\\" was coined by Narendra Modi, BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2014 Indian general election. According to Modi, he got the idea for the slogan from the leader of his main opposition party, Indian National Congress, and then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh. On 8 January 2014, while addressing the audience during Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Singh said, \\"Yes, we are facing bad days now but the good days will be coming soon\\". During his speech at the same event the following day, Modi referred to Singh and repeated his statement in Hindi, which stuck as the slogan, Achhe din aane wale hain. The slogan was used by BJP for Modi's lead campaign for the 2014 Indian general election.

A victory song incorporating the slogan was also released by BJP. The slogan was considered decisive for BJP's victory. But the slogan has also been criticised for inflating expectations that the new government can quickly turn around the economy and spur economic growth. Since the election, the slogan often has been referred to by various people while expressing their optimism about a better future under Modi's government. British politician George Osborne referred to the phrase when he came to India with a business delegation. The slogan was used by British Prime Minister David Cameron while introducing Modi at an event in Wembley Stadium, London on 13 November 2015. Cameron told the crowd, \\"They said a chai wala would never govern the largest democracy, but he proved them wrong. He rightly said acche din aane wale hain.

It was converted to a state college, named as Rizal Polytechnic College in 1995 through Republic Act 7933 and later on merged with Rizal State College and the Rizal Technological University Antipolo Annex and became part of the present University of Rizal System - Morong Campus. History and Architecture =1944-1951= In 1944, the people in eastern Rizal requested Governor Nicanor Roxas to establish a public high school in Morong since the only provincial high school in Rizal was the Rizal High School in Pasig, which was about forty kilometers from Morong. The school was temporarily housed in the Commandancia, a Spanish building in the town plaza of Morong. Sports and physical education activities were held in the town plaza. Mr. Juan D. Francisco of Eastern Rizal Academy provided the necessary furniture and equipment. There were 252 pioneer students from the first to fourth year level who hailed from different municipalities in Rizal. The old bell which rang during the first opening of classes on August 16, 1944On August 16, 1944, the establishment of Morong High School was approved. Mr. Monico Mateo became the Founding Principal. On December 22, 1944, the school was closed due to the arrival of the American Liberation Forces but was re-opened on July 1, 1945 during the re-established Commonwealth. From 1944 to 1951, there was a struggle to acquire a school site for Morong High School. On November 20, 1951, a site at the back of Tomas Claudio Memorial Elementary School, formerly Morong Elementary School, was acquired. =1952-1976= On October 16, 1952, the Morong High School was transferred to its permanent site and the construction of the home economics building was started. A one-room concrete building was built and was used as a library. Additional improvements were made by constructing comfort rooms and additional classrooms. The additional wing to the main building was constructed with the release of 20,000 pesos as part of the pork barrel funds of Senate President Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. and Congressman Serafin Salvador. In 1958, a building housing a cafeteria, retail store, storeroom, native kitchen and dining hall was constructed. The construction of main gate made of welded iron bars, which started in 1955, was completed in this year. In June 1961, the dilapidated camarins which were used as classrooms since 1952 were replaced with two one-storey Rodriguez-type buildings with four rooms each, with window jalousies to accommodate the increasing school population. These buildings were inaugurated on September 28, 1961. The agronomy building with a tool room was also completed. The library building was remodeled, by constructing a mezzanine floor and an office for the school newspaper. The campus landscape was also improved by adding a lagoon and dike along the creek and cementing the pathway. Typhoon Yoling damaged the high school gymnasium, the home economics building, the Rodriguez-type buildings and part of the administration building on November 19, 1970. The gymnasium was never replaced. On October 11, 1975, the construction of Amang Hall started. On July 7, 1976, the Provincial Board of Rizal requested for the nationalization of Morong High School. It was on August 20, 1976 when it was converted into Morong National High School. =1977-1982= On March 30, 1977, another turning point in the school's history happened when it was converted to Morong National Comprehensive School, where general education, both college preparatory and vocational- technical courses, were offered. It became one of the 28 comprehensive high schools in the country during that time. This building was constructed in 1975. It remained in its present status after all other buildings were demolished.On February 27, 1980, the massive infrastructure project started for the Morong National Comprehensive School complex. The old buildings were demolished except the Amang Hall, which became the laboratory school. =1983-1988= The school integrated with Tomas Claudio Memorial Elementary School and converted to Rizal Technological and Polytechnic Institute, by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 469, signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 10, 1983. The school complex was inaugurated on November 29, 1983. =1995= The Rizal Technological and Polytechnic Institute became the Rizal Polytechnic College, a state college on March 1, 1995 through Republic Act 7933 with extension campuses in Cainta and Cardona. =2001 to Present= By virtue of Republic Act 9157 signed on August 11, 2001, Rizal Polytechnic College became part of University of Rizal System, merging with Rizal State College (former Rizal College of Agriculture and Technology (RCAT) Pililla, Rizal Campus) and Rizal Technological University Antipolo Annex. Its area presently covers approximately 17 hectares including the area occupied by DepEd public elementary and secondary schools. Advance and well-planned facilities are currently serving its students and faculty of the colleges of Education, Industrial Technology, Science and Engineering.

(born 15 December 1950) is a German-born Ukrainian- American cinematographer, best known for his acclaimed collaborations with director Tim Burton on films like Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, and Ed Wood, for which he won several film critics' awards. Biography Born in Oldenburg in West Germany to Ukrainian parents, his family emigrated to United States while he was still an infant, and then settled in Cleveland. After studying at Case Western Reserve, he enrolled in a film studies graduate program at Columbia University, and permanently relocated to New York City.  Career  = Early career = Renowned for his ‚Äúbroad range of styles‚Äù working alongside directors such as Tim Burton and Boaz Yakin, Czapsky has cemented himself as a chameleon of cinematography profession. Graduating from Case Western Reserve with a BFA in the humanities and an emphasis on film history and criticism, Czapsky moved to New York where he attended a graduate program at the University of Columbia. There he transitioned into the film production business working positions such as ‚ÄúAssistant Cameraman, Gaffer, and Key Grip,‚Äù for productions such as After Hours, Matewan, and Q. His work alongside directors Scorsese and Cohen opened up the opportunity for him to shoot his first feature film, On the Edge. Shooting iconic stars such as Pam Grier and Bruce Dern, Czapsky was able to create the sense that these were not ‚ÄúHollywood locations but rooms where human voices were heard.‚Äù = Feature Films = The independent success of On the Edge prompted Czapsky to get a cinematographer role alongside Robert Chappell for Erroll Morris‚Äô The Thin Blue Line. A film regarded as ‚Äúamong the most important documentaries ever made,‚Äù it won various awards for Best Documentary (1988) from the New York Film Critics Circle, The National Board of Review, and several others. Czapsky, within the same year, quickly transitioned his style for Robert Bierman‚Äôs Vampire‚Äôs Kiss. Though a box office flop, the dark New York atmosphere captured by Czapsky provided the perfect backdrop for Nicholas Cage‚Äôs ‚Äúoutrageously unbridled performance,‚Äù and helped the film garner a cult following. Some of Czapsky's most notable work is derived from his projects alongside expressionist director Tim Burton. Their first collaboration was one of Burton's most notable works in Edward Scissorhands. Czapsky's fluidity behind the lens helped to differentiate the surrealistic suburbs from the darkness of Edwards isolation giving the film an ‚Äúethereal,‚Äù atmosphere. In 1992 the duo would return to shoot Batman Returns with big names such as Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Danny DeVito. Shot on a Panavision Panaflex Gold II in 35mm. Their third and final project, Ed Wood, would serve to be their most critically successful. ‚ÄúExquisitely shot in black and white,‚Äù the film won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, a Golden Globe for Best Makeup and Hair styling, and a Best Cinematography award from the National Society of Film Critics. Czapsky's departure from his work with Burton would prompt him to explore other avenues of style within film. His next cinematography project in 1996, Matilda, saw him reunite with Batman Returns villain Danny DeVito who took on the role of director. In this children's classic, Devito and Czapsky worked together to ‚Äúcreate a world that is slightly larger and considerably funnier than life.‚Äù In the 2000s Czapsky further diversified his genre palate working with director Boaz Yakin on two action movies, Safe and Fighting. The former starring Jason Statham and the latter Channing Tatum, the use of ‚Äúgraceful single shot sequences,‚Äù helped to induce the stress and thrill needed in such movies. On a much lighter note, Czapsky's work with Josh Gordon on the 2007 comedy Blades of Glory, was a commercial success with the film grossing $145 million in the box office off a $53 million budget. Shooting comedic legends Will Ferrell and Jon Heder, this was one of Czapsky's first comedic endeavors and it paid off. Recently, Czapsky has shifted his cinematography work to the television shooting episodes of shows such as Shades of Blue, Quantico, and God Friended Me.

The sacred item was normally kept under guard, and Zulu kings sometimes seated themselves on it when going to war. The preparation of an iNkatha can be traced back to the time of king Senzangakhona, the father of Shaka. The last inkatha yezwe (grass coil of the nation) was destroyed in 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War. Preparation Specialized iziNyanga (or medicine men) initiated a ritual vomiting exercise when the Zulu army prepared for battle, by administering an emetic to the soldiers. Each soldier of the impi would vomit into the straw-filled pit, and the medicine men would bound the contents into a thick, coiled mat. The woven coil also included rags of the garments of foreign royals, material drawn from the regimental huts and other substances of metaphysical significance. Mundane use Besides the inkatha yezwe, an inkatha may also be a grass coil that is placed on the head as a support when a heavy object is carried on the head. Meaning and purpose The iNkatha was a visible expression of the Zulu nation's unity, and the continuity of its royal line. As it was bound round and round it was considered to represent the binding together of the Zulu people, and symbolised political integration and authority. It also signifies \\"support under stress,\\" due to its everyday use as a head support. Due to its potency in the collective imagination, the iNkatha's imagery was invoked in the 20th century political movements of king Solomon, chief Buthelezi and others.

Walter Ruben and written by Bernard Schubert. The film based on a play by William Gillette, stars Richard Dix, Shirley Grey, and Nance O'Neil. The film was released on November 14, 1931, by RKO Pictures. Plot Two Union officers, Captain Lewis Dumont and his younger brother, Lieutenant Henry Dumont, receive orders from General Ulysses S. Grant Grant to go behind enemy lines and become undercover agents to feed false information to the Confederate States Army. Lewis is tasked with becoming part of a Confederate telegraph office in Richmond, Virginia, under the guise of a deceased Confederate officer, Thorne. Meanwhile, Henry is ordered to allow himself to be captured by the enemy, during which he is supposed to pass incorrect information about Union positions. Thorne comes upon the tail-end of a skirmish between Union and Confederate soldiers, during which he is wounded. After the battle, he carries one of the wounded southerners, Howard Varney, back to his family's plantation. This endears Thorne to the family of the wounded rebel, particularly Varney's father, who is a Confederate general. While recuperating from his own wounds, Thorne develops a romantic relationship with Howard's sister, Edith. However, this creates enmity with one of the locals who was interested in Edith prior to Thorne's arrival, Arlesford. When Thorne enlists one of the Varney's slaves to take a message to his brother in the prisoner of war camp, Arlesford, already suspicious of Thorne, sets a trap. When the trap is sprung, the slave is executed by hanging. As the two Dumont brothers develop their plan for giving false information, and allowing Union troops to break through the Confederate lines, the younger brother is brought from the prison camp to the Varney plantation. Rather than allow their plan to be uncovered, Henry shoots himself. The elder Dumont, torn between duty and his love for Edith, is eventually uncovered as a spy. However, it is also discovered that he never sent the false information. As he is led away to prison, Edith vows to wait for him.

It addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. The standard came into force on 1 January 2018, replacing the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, IAS 39. History IFRS 9 began as a joint project with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which promulgates accounting standards in the United States. The boards published a joint discussion paper in March 2008 proposing an eventual goal of reporting all financial instruments at fair value, with all changes in fair value reported in net income (FASB) or profit and loss (IASB). As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, the boards decided to revise their accounting standards for financial instruments to address perceived deficiencies which were believed to have contributed to the magnitude of the crisis. The boards disagreed on several important issues, and also took different approaches to developing the new financial instruments standard. FASB attempted to develop a comprehensive standard that would address classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting at the same time, and issued an exposure draft of a standard addressing all three components in 2010. In contrast, the IASB attempted to develop the new standard in phases, releasing each component of the new standard separately. In 2009, IASB issued the first portion of IFRS, covering classification and measurement of financial assets. This was intended to replace the asset classification and measurement sections of IAS 39, but not supersede other sections of IAS 39. In 2010, IASB issued another portion of IFRS 9, primarily covering classification and measurement of financial liabilities and also addressing aspects of applying fair value option and bifurcating embedded derivatives. Certain elements of IFRS 9 as issued were criticized by some key IASB constituents. The model for classifying debt instrument assets permitted only two approaches, fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit and loss (FVPL), or amortized cost. This represented a significant deviation from FASB decisions, which would also have a category of fair value with certain changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (FVOCI). In addition to creating significant divergence with FASB, the lack of a FVOCI category would have been inconsistent with the accounting model being developed by the IASB for insurance contracts. There were also concerns that the criteria for qualifying for the amortized cost category were overly stringent and would force many financial instruments to be reported at fair value even though they could be appropriately accounted for at amortized cost. To address these concerns, IASB issued an exposure draft in 2012 proposing limited amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Meanwhile, IASB and FASB worked together to develop a model for impairment of financial assets. IASB issued an exposure draft proposing an impairment model in 2013. FASB decided to propose an alternative impairment model. IASB was also developing its hedge accounting model independently of FASB, and issued that portion of the IFRS 9 standard in 2013. The final IFRS 9 standard, including hedge accounting, impairment, and the amended classification and measurement guidance, was issued on 24 July 2014. Early evidence on the market reaction to the IFRS 9 in Europe suggests overall a positive response to the IFRS 9, although heterogeneities across countries exist. Classification and measurement As amended, IFRS 9 had four possible classification categories for financial assets, including a FVOCI classification for debt instruments. The classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reporting in profit and loss (FVPL). In order to meet the contractual cash flow test, the cash flows from the instrument must consist of only principal and interest. Among the amendments to classification and measurement made in the 2014 update, de minimis and \\"non-genuine\\" features can be disregarded from the test, meaning that a de minimis feature would not preclude an instrument from being reported at amortized cost or FVOCI. However, equity instruments, derivatives and instruments that contain other than de minimis embedded derivatives would have to be reported at FVPL. If the asset passes the contractual cash flows test, the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., it is not expected to be sold, it is classified as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is reported at FVOCI. For a FVOCI asset, the amortized cost basis is used to determine profit and loss, but the asset is reported at fair value on the balance sheet, with the difference between amortized cost and fair value reported in other comprehensive income. For any other business model, such as holding the asset for trading, the asset is reported at FVPL. IFRS 9 retained most of the measurement guidance for liabilities from IAS 39, meaning most financial liabilities are held at amortized cost, the only change relating to liabilities that utilize the fair value option. For those liabilities, the change in fair value related to the entity's own credit standing is reported in other comprehensive income rather than profit and loss. IFRS 9 retained the concept of fair value option from IAS 39, but revised the criteria for financial assets. Under a fair value option, an asset or liability that would otherwise be reported at amortized cost or FVOCI can use FVPL instead. IFRS 9 also incorporated a FVOCI option for certain equity instruments that are not held for trading. Under this option, the instrument is reported at FVOCI similar to FVOCI for debt. However, this version of FVOCI does not permit \\"recycling.\\" Whereas when debt instruments using FVOCI are sold, the gain or loss on sale is \\"recycled\\" from other comprehensive income to profit and loss, for FVOCI equities the gain or loss is never reported in profit and loss, but rather remains in other comprehensive income. Impairment IFRS 9 requires an impairment allowance against the amortized cost of financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI. The change in this allowance is reported in profit and loss. For most such assets, when the asset is acquired the impairment allowance is measured as the present value of credit losses from default events projected over the next 12 months. The allowance will continue to be based on the expected losses from defaults on the receivables recognised at the balance sheet date in the next 12 months following, unless there is a significant increase in credit risk (\\"SICR\\"). If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the allowance is measured as the present value of all credit losses projected for the instrument over its full lifetime. If the credit risk recovers, the allowance can once again be limited to the projected credit losses over the following 12 months. An exception to the general impairment model applies to financial assets that are credit impaired when they were originally acquired. For these assets, the impairment allowance is always based on the change in projected lifetime credit losses since the asset was acquired. The new impairment model is intended to address a criticism of the impairment model used during the financial crisis, that it allowed companies to delay recognition of asset impairments. The new model requires companies to more quickly recognize projected lifetime losses. FASB elected to use a different approach to accelerating recognition of impairment losses, requiring full lifetime recognition from the time the asset is acquired, referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses or CECL model. Under both IFRS 9 and the FASB model there will be a loss, to the extent of the allowance, when most assets covered by this guidance are acquired. This loss will be smaller under the IFRS 9 model, due to the 12 month limit. Hedge accounting IFRS 9 updated the guidance for hedge accounting. The intent was to \\"[align] the accounting treatment with risk management activities, enabling entities to reflect better these activities in their financial statements.\\" The changes also make it more feasible for non-financial entities to use hedge accounting. The changes permit more use of hedge accounting for components of instruments and groups of contracts, and ease the hedge effectiveness test. They also enhance the disclosures related to hedges and risk management with a requirement to refer to a formal risk management strategy or describe it clearly in the hedge documentation.

He reached the summit of Mount Everest by the Southwest Face on the first expedition to successfully take that route, in 1975. Biography Pertemba was born in 1948 in Khumjung, Solukhumbu where his father farmed with about forty yaks. He was sent to live with his grandparents near Cho Oyo in the Gokyo valley when he was five and then his aunts living near Tengboche Monastery looked after him. He studied with the monks there but when he was eight he became very ill and almost died. He started his education in 1961 at a school founded by Edmund Hillary was first opened and where he stayed for five years. Failing to get a scholarship to continue his education, in 1966 he got a job in the kitchen at Lukla Airport and then, helped by his knowledge of English, he moved to Kathmandu to join the first trekking agency in Nepal, Jimmy Roberts' Mountain Travel. He first was a high-altitude porter on a number of expeditions before he became a Sherpa leader or sirdar. He has donated his family's ancestral house in Khumjung for it to become the Sherpa Heritage House museum - it is the last traditional house in Solu Khhumbu. Pertemba is vice chairman of the Himalayan Trust and was a founder member of the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project. He has been an executive member of the Himalayan Rescue Association, and of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. He has been awarded the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu (first class) by the King of Nepal. Bonington has described him as being assured and dynamic. Pertemba is married and has children. Mountaineering and trekking He took part as a climber in Chris Bonington's 1970 Annapurna and 1975 Everest Southwest Face expeditions (the latter as sirdar). Bonington said he consulted Pertemba frequently, sometimes to the irritation of the lead climbers when he accepted the sirdar's opinion over theirs of the capabilities of the Sherpas and even on the best route to be followed. He was expedition co-leader on the American first ascent of Gauri Sankar in 1979. He has climbed Mount Everest three times although he stopped climbing in 1995 while continuing to lead climbing and trekking expeditions. In 1985 with two business partners he established a trekking agency called Nepal Himal and he has given climbing seminars in the United States and Europe. Pertemba has also climbed in Switzerland, Alaska and Britain.

It has, however, had a certain impact on the country's cultural and political evolution. History Between the late 19th century and the first third of the 20th century, the most active period in the region's anarchist history, there were few Venezuelan anarchists. There were, however, a somewhat significant number of local intellectuals who were at least influenced by the ideology's theorists. Among them were Ezequiel Zamora (1817-1860), a Liberal politician and prominent rebel leader during the Federal War, who is said to have been influenced by among others Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. The 2001 land reform program Mission Zamora was named after him. One reason behind the weakness of the early anarchist movement was the regime of Juan Vicente G√≥mez, who ruled Venezuela both as elected president and unelected military strongman between 1908 and 1935. G√≥mez extensively persecuted rivals, political dissidents, and trade unionists. Among the later victims were members of a nascent anarcho- syndicalist movement, belonging to an ideology brought in by radical immigrants from Europe. While they were few in numbers, the efforts of these people in forming mutual societies, organizing oil industry strikes, spreading propaganda, etc. gained them a certain notoriety, but also the full attention of G√≥mez's persecution. Some early communists had anarchist influences - P√≠o Tamayo (1898-1935), a revolutionary poet and co-founder of the Communist Party of Venezuela, taught his fellow political prisoners the \\"socialism of Bakunin and Marx\\". Tamayo, who died in prison, was imprisoned by G√≥mez. Another political prisoner during this period was the Colombian individualist anarchist Biofilo Panclasta (1879‚Äì1943), who participated in the \\"Revoluci√≥n Liberal Restauradora\\" of Cipriano Castro, aiding in the overthrow of President Ignacio Andrade, prior to his encounter of anarchist thought. Arrested in 1914 after returning to Venezuela, Panclasta spent seven years in prison, more due to his friendship with Castro (deposed in a coup d'√©tat by G√≥mez) than for his ideology. After the end of the G√≥mez regime, and with the growth of new politicals movements in Venezuela, many libertarian-minded radicals were absorbed by or helped found non-anarchist organizations, as in the case of P√≠o Tamayo. Like Tamayo, some joined the Communist Party of Venezuela. Others were among the founders of the Democratic Action in 1941. Between 1936 and 1945, anti-anarchist repression had a constitutional footing, in the form of the Ley Lara (Lara Law). After the Spanish Civil War, many exiled anarchists arrived in Venezuela, finding a political climate far different from that of interwar Spain. This second wave of anarchist European immigrants caused the regrowth of the small libertarian scene, primarily through the foundation of the Federaci√≥n Obrera Regional Venezolana (FORVE, Venezuelan Regional Workers Federation) in 1958, after ten years of harsh military dictatorship. FORVE was affiliated with the International Workers' Association, a global anarcho- syndicalist movement founded in 1922. Some additional minor groups were formed, and newspapers, pamphlets and books were published, but few of these left the Spanish immigrant milieu. In later years, as the ageing Spanish Civil War veterans diminished in importance, few movements would associate with the anarchist label. Some libertarian influence was seen among students in the Renovaci√≥n Universitaria (University Renewal) of 1968-1970, part of the Protests of 1968. It wasn't until the 1980s that anarchist movements again resurfaced - the Colectivo Autogestionario Libertario (CAL. Libertarian Self- managing Collective) was the most visible. Two journals, El Libertario (published by CAl 1985-87) and Correo A (published 1987-1995) emerged. Some youths were drawn in through anarcho-punk. The Cuban anarchist editorial collective Gu√°ngara had correspondents in Venezuela, by 1985. Prominently, the Argentine anarchist philosopher and university professor √Ångel Cappelletti (1927‚Äì1995) worked in Venezuela for 26 years, until his retirement in 1994. =Contemporary= In 1995 the newspaper El Libertario reappeared, published by a group calling itself the Commission of Anarchist Relations (CRA). The CRA, which restyled itself the Collective Editorship in 2007, opposes the Chavismo and Bolivarian Revolution of former President Hugo Ch√°vez, the Fifth Republic Movement, and its successor the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. The group sees itself as involved in a \\"tri-polar struggle\\" against both the left-wing government and Venezuela's American-backed right-wing opposition movement. El Libertario publishes five editions yearly. Other minor groups exist or have existed, such as the CESL in Caracas, the CEA in M√©rida, and the Ateneo La Libertaria, first active in Biscucuy and then in the rural area to the southwest of Lara. In January 2006 the Alternative Social Forum was organized in Caracas, and the Anarchist Black Cross has been somewhat active in the country. In 2011, the minor Federaci√≥n Anarquista Revolucionaria de Venezuela (FARV) was formed. Unlike the CRA and El Libertario, the group took firmly pro-Boliviarian stances, stating that it supported the \\"Bolivarian process critically as radical militants of the Social revolution\\". Their ideas and principles were \\"based on the especifist trend within libertarian communism\\". In October 2013, Ch√°vez's successor, President Nicol√°s Maduro, accused unionist workers of the SIDOR steel company of being behind regional unemployment, denouncing them as \\"anarcho-syndicalist populists\\".

It also engaged in information technology consulting, hosted service bureaus, and provided applications and services for behavioral health providers. ACT had two subsidiaries of note, InterACT and Creative Socio-Medics. Both writer Katharine Davis Fishman, in her 1981 book The Computer Establishment, and computer science historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, in his 2003 volume From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry, have considered ACT an exemplar of the independent, middle-sized software development firms of its era, and the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota has also viewed the company's history as important.See Fishman, The Computer Establishment, p. 268; Campbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, p. 57; and Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, Preface. Fishman portrays Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and its chief executive, Frank Lautenberg, as the exemplar of the large software company of the time. Campbell-Kelly portrays Applied Data Research (ADR) and Informatics General as two other typical software firms of the 1960s. Other oral histories conducted for the Charles Babbage Institute's Software History Center have included ones of Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston of VisiCalc, Dan Fylstra of Personal Software, Seymour I. Rubinstein of MicroPro International, and Jonathan Sachs of Lotus Software. Of these three sources, Campbell-Kelly is the least impressed by ACT's characteristics as a company, saying that its renown is owed mostly to its president's flair for publicity. Founding and early history ACT spent its first few years in converted space atop The Plaza hotel on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York (here seen in 2010). Advanced Computer Techniques was founded in New York City in April 1962 by Charles P. Lecht.Fishman, The Computer Establishment, p. 269.Campbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, p. 58. It had an initial capitalization of $800, one contract, and one employee. Lecht, in his late twenties at the time, was a mathematician and entrepreneur whose involvement with the computer industry dated back to the early 1950s.Lecht, The Waves of Change, back cover. The new firm's first job was fixing a language compiler on the UNIVAC LARC computer, which was being used by the United States Navy. UNIVAC awarded a $100,000 contract for the work; Lecht hired some programmers and the company's first office was in former servant quarters atop the Plaza Hotel.Fishman, The Computer Establishment, p. 276. The firm was one of 40‚Äì50 software companies started in the early 1960s, many of which would go on to be forgotten. Creating compilers became a key part of the company's early efforts; its first compiler, for the FORTRAN language, was developed in the mid-1960s. This was followed by a COBOL compiler later in that decade, then a FORTRAN 77 compiler and a Pascal compiler both in the late 1970s. As the 1960s went on, ACT built a customer list of established companies and developed a reputation for delivering quality work on schedule. The company moved to regular office space,Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 3‚Äì4. the first of several locations it would have during its lifetime, all of which were within greater Midtown Manhattan on or near Madison Avenue. In addition to UNIVAC, early customers for the firm's compiler work included IBM and Honeywell.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 4‚Äì6. With few trained computer programmers available at the time, Lecht hired those with musical, linguistic, or mathematical backgrounds, finding them to be successful at this new activity. The firm also did other system software as well as scientific programming projects, including some for the defense industry, and then started doing commercial applications development for large companies such as Union Carbide, United Airlines, Hoffman-LaRoche, and Shell Oil. Lecht fostered a relaxed working environment where dress was informal and hours flexible.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 6‚Äì7. He instituted a series of weekly reports that all developers had to file detailing their progress; these were communicated to the client, on the theory that \\"a client can get angry at us, but [they] can't be more than one week angry at us because we told [them] exactly where we were.\\" Management personality Lecht was a colorful and flamboyant character with an idiosyncratic sense of style, who went around on a motorcycle and was described as a \\"showman\\" by colleagues, customers, and competitors alike. At one point his office and desk were completely covered by silver square tiles. ACT benefited from his flair for publicity: He, together with the company, was profiled in The New Yorker in 1967 and later in industry publications such as Datamation, which once referred to him as \\"One of computerdom's most flashy characters\\". Lecht published several textbooks on programming covering different languages. ACT organized a series of seminars for the American Management Association on project management for developing computer applications.Campbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, pp. 66‚Äì67. The seminars were organized into a 1967 book by Lecht, The Management of Computer Programming Projects, that was likely the first book ever published on the topic.Campbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, p. 69. The company also published A Guide for Software Documentation in 1969, compiled and edited by Dorothy Walsh, which was again one of the first of its kind and was cited by a number of other publications in the years to follow. Also Perhaps the most strangely famous of Lecht's outputs was the album of IBM corporate spirit songs that he had recorded by the Association of British Secretaries in America (for a while all of ACT's secretaries came from England). Entitled Paean, and with album sleeve text bemoaning the loss of the company-mindedness of the 1930s‚Äì1950s, it was released via Skye Records in 1969. Also It became a popular giveaway at trade shows such as the Joint Computer Conferences. The title track, set to the tune of \\"Molly Malone\\", was adapted in praise of Lecht himself: :Charles Lecht is our leader :Ideal idea breeder :The source of our strength :and the spine of our will Lecht's book The Waves of Change, which attempted to foretell changes in the computer industry, was serialized in Computerworld magazine in 1977 (a first for a trade publication) and published by McGraw-Hill in 1979. The foreword was written by Gideon I. Gartner, who would soon found the influential information technology research and advisory firm the Gartner Group.Lecht, The Waves of Change, pp. i‚Äìvi. Waves of Change sold well and received a positive reception. The books, along with his national speaking and lecturing engagements, bolstered both Lecht's and ACT's visibility within the technology industry. The eccentricities of the president were balanced by the firm's second-in-command, executive vice-president Oscar H. Schachter, a lawyer who had graduated from Yeshiva College and Harvard Law School and who had a more straight-laced personality.Fishman, The Computer Establishment, pp. 278‚Äì279. Schachter was a neighbor of Lecht's who did some legal work for the company during its inception, served on its early board of directors for a few years, and then joined the company full-time in 1966.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 1‚Äì3. As Schachter later said, \\"I was kind of the governor ... The person who sat on Charlie, or tried to.\\"Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 7‚Äì8. While with ACT, Schachter would also become a significant presence in the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO),Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 23‚Äì25. a rapidly growing industry organization during the 1960sCampbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, p. 63. and later. ACT was ahead of the industry in hiring female executives. There were several at the vice presidential level in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Expansion and diversification During 1969 to 1982, ACT had its main offices in this tower at 437 Madison Avenue (here seen in 2011). ACT became a publicly owned company in May 1968. The initial public offering was handled by boutique technology underwriter Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan, and the stock value increased almost four-fold during the first day of trading, ending with a three-fold gain that The New York Times termed \\"spectacular\\". The firm had captured a wave of investor interest in technology stocks.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 11‚Äì13. ACT had revenues in the $2.5-3.2 million range during 1968‚Äì70.Campbell-Kelly, From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog, p. 60. It began a course of diversification beyond consulting and software development by acquiring, in 1969, Rhode Island Lithograph, a printing company in Rhode Island (that was owned by Lecht's brother Danny), and Informatab, a data processing market research company, and by opening Inter-ACT, a training and education arm that wrote computer help manuals that were sold to schools and businesses. Lecht had a goal that ACT be a \\"supermarket of services for the computer industry\\".Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 8‚Äì10. Software houses of the time tended to suffer from unprofitable contracts, failed ventures, and slowing demand.Fishman, The Computer Establishment, pp. 277‚Äì278. During 1971‚Äì72, ACT suffered a downturn, showing its first annual losses; Lecht closed several offices and laid off half of the firm's employees, but the firm survived when many others did not. By 1974, its revenues had reached the $5 million mark. The most important diversification was into service bureaus, which by 1979 accounted for some 40 percent of the company's revenue. These bureaus, which provided their own equipment to handle the data processing needs of clients, were located in New York, Phoenix, Tucson, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and Milan, Italy, and each tended to specialize in a particular area, such as the Edmonton one reporting on inventory and financial status for the Canadian oil and construction industry. There were also consulting offices for various periods of time in London, Paris, Chicago, and Atlanta. The company also began entering the packaged software business, developing compilers and related tools as a product. The advent of minicomputers created a market for the compilers and Data General became a major customer.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 16‚Äì17. But Lecht's visibility within the industry only went so far; the company lacked an effective marketing capability for its products to go further.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 17‚Äì20, 26. In addition, the company struggled with the transition in business models from customers fully funding projects and owning the end results, to an approach where the company would have to make periodic investments in its own products to keep improving them. During the 1970s, the company established an office in Tehran.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 13‚Äì15. Over time IBM withdrew from that market and the regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi decided to standardize on the Honeywell 6000 series for the Iranian military. ACT gained a subcontract from Honeywell's Italian subsidiary to do an inventory system for the Imperial Iranian Air Force and Information Systems Iran. The name Inter-Act was again used for this venture. The contract represented up to a quarter of ACT's business for a while, but then ended without ACT being fully paid, and following the Iranian Revolution, ACT became party to the Iran‚ÄìUnited States Claims Tribunal. In 1983 it received an award of some $300,000 from the tribunal. An ACT promotional item: a room thermometer paperweight ACT was also an earlier entrant in the word processing field in the mid-late-1970s, acquiring Base Information Systems and its Ultratext System technology and partnering with Honeywell to put the system on the Honeywell Level 6 minicomputer. The product received a positive review in Computerworld in 1976 and was still being actively marketed in 1979. But Wang Laboratories captured much of this word processing market; the Ultratext product may have been overly complicated and Schachter later lamented that ACT letting the opportunity to make an impression in this domain slip away was \\"one of our worst failures\\". By 1979, ACT was effectively a worldwide mini-conglomerate. It had revenues over $16 million and in terms of size was in the top 60 of over 3,000 companies in the software, services, and facilities management sector.Fishman, The Computer Establishment, pp. 279‚Äì280. It derived approximately equal revenues from overseas as from the U.S. By 1981 the company stated it had 318 employees.The figure of 318 employees comes from . Alternate numbers exist: around 1979, Lecht was quoted as telling a potential customer that there were 400 employees (Fishman, The Computer Establishment, p. 271), while the biographical blurb on the back cover of Lecht's 1979 Waves of Change said ACT had over 450 employees. Its display advertising for programming positions it was hiring for was a familiar sight in computer trade papers such as Computerworld. It still had its idiosyncratic characteristics; Lecht spoke publicly about a psychologist who visited ACT to discuss employee complaints, saying it saved him two days a week worth of work and predicting it would become a future corporate trend. Change at the top and refocusing From 1982 to 1989, the offices of ACT were located at 32nd Street and Madison Avenue (here seen in 2019). One entrance was in the building at the far right, 16 East 32nd Street, while the other entrance at the far left, 136 Madison Avenue. The two buildings adjoined with connecting passage at the rears. In the early 1980s a change hit the company. The company's revenues stayed in the $15‚Äì16 million range during 1980 and 1981, but it lost over $0.6 million in the first year and over $1.5 million in the second. Several business, including the service bureaus, were losing money, and there were significant cost overruns developing a set of Pascal compilers. In addition there were accounting problems in 1980 regarding the accumulation of costs on some long- term contracts. By Schachter's later telling, the San Francisco investment firm Birr, Wilson made a capital infusion into the company and placed a member on the board of directors. That director was unsatisfied with how Lecht was running the company, in particular the number of different businesses ACT was in and Lecht's disinclination to close down the unprofitable ones. The inside board members then joined with the outside one and asked Lecht to go. Schachter later said, \\"It was, of all the things I did in my entire business career, the most difficult thing I ever did, but I just felt the company was at severe risk of going bankrupt if we didn't really take a different position and a different posture.\\"Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 20‚Äì21. In May 1982, Lecht departed ACT. When it happened, Lecht portrayed the split as his own choice to the press, saying he wanted to pursue writing, speaking, and other activities related to technology. But as Datamation wrote at the time, the departure came \\"with more than a little pushing\\". Lawsuits were filed between the company and Lecht; they were settled in February 1983 in an agreement that involved the company buying back Lecht's shares. (A few years later, Lecht said he had left because he became saddened watching the company spirit he had established turn into what he called a \\"bureaucracy of yuppie nincompoops\\".) Lecht later went on to form LSI, Lecht Sciences Incorporated. Schachter became president upon Lecht's departure, and, a year later, CEO. During the rest of 1982, the company sold off its two main service bureaus, those in Phoenix and Edmonton, and closed down two smaller money-losing businesses. The company became profitable again during the second half of 1982. Revenue, which reached an all-time high of $18 million for all of 1982, fell to $11 million the next year as a result. But it then climbed steadily back up, reaching $15 million by 1986, while operating profit also gradually improved, surpassing $1 million in 1986. During the 1980s, the company expanded its language products into those desired by the defense industry for embedded systems deployment. The first JOVIAL compiler was produced in 1981, targeted for the Zilog Z8002 16-bit, small memory processor. This was soon followed by a JOVIAL compiler targeted to the popular MIL-STD-1750A 16-bit processor architecture specification. With these compilers came associated tools such as assemblers, linkers, runtime systems, simulators, and symbolic debuggers. These cross-development tools were typically hosted on either IBM System/370 mainframes or VAX/VMS minicomputers. General Dynamics became the biggest customer for the JOVIAL product, especially for its use in the avionics for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, but it was sold to a number of other defense contractors as well. Reception center at the 32nd Street office of ACT in the mid-1980s In 1984, the company received $3 million in funding for new products from Prudential-Bache Securities. This was used to continue the development of commercial language compilers: A BASIC compiler was developed in 1985, which along with COBOL, FORTRAN, and Pascal, was supplied to AT&T; Computer Systems' 3B series computers. A C language compiler was developed by 1986. Around the same time, the commercial compilers were enhanced to support the latest standards, COBOL-85 and draft FORTRAN 8X, as part of a contract for compilers for the BiiN joint venture. The cash infusion from Prudential-Bache was also used to develop a compiler system for the Ada programming language, targeted to the MIL-STD-1750A architecture. This consisted of a compiler front-end licensed from DDC-I in Denmark (itself an offshoot of the Dansk Datamatik Center) married to a compiler back-end from ACT that made use of the company's existing tools for the MIL-STD-1750A. ACT became the first U.S. company to successfully validate an Ada 1750A compiler past the strenuous Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) validation suite. Between JOVIAL and Ada, the company would gain a number of high-profile defense contractors as customers throughout the 1980s. The company also continued its commercial applications group, in particular working during the early-mid 1980s on a major contract for developing parts of Chemical Bank's pioneering home banking system called Pronto. However the bank's system was ahead of its time and despite heavy promotion did not gain much use. The applications group was closed down in 1986. InterACT In July 1987, ACT transferred its software division of compilers and related tools to a new joint venture called InterACT that was two-thirds owned by LSI Logic and one-third by ACT. (This was now the third time that some form of 'InterACT' had been used.) The goal of InterACT was to produce a set of products for what it termed the CASHE space (Computer Aided Software/Hardware Engineering). This would include ACT's existing compilers, assemblers, linkers, simulators, and debuggers; a CASE tool, Interactive Development Environments's Software Through Pictures; a CAE tool, LSI Logic's LSI Design System; and novel components, including bridged hardware and software simulation models and graphic editors and administration tools allowing automated composition of all the other tools. The total set of products, initially called CASHE but then called the System Design Environment (SDE), was aimed at providing embedded systems developers a way to design, simulate, and debug their embedded applications while hardware was still being developed, without having to wait for a prototype. Another motivation for ACT entering into the agreement was to gain access to LSI Logic's sales and marketing operation, which was much larger than its own. The company's work on commercial compilers was gradually shut down, although a C cross compiler to the Intel i960 embedded architecture was completed and had some sales success. Entrance to 417 Fifth Avenue in 1989, where the offices of InterACT were from then to 1991 A scene and a view from the InterACT offices in 1991 Schachter was initially CEO of InterACT, but then Edward D. Bright, who had held several executive positions with ACT, took over, while Schachter remained CEO of ACT. InterACT lost money from the start: $0.5 million in the second half of 1987 and $2.5 million in 1988. The new SDE product proved difficult and expensive to build, and after a while LSI Logic wanted out.Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, p. 22. An executive at IBM became very interested in the potential of SDE, at a time when IBM was making investments in a number of small companies. Thus, in November 1988, InterACT bought back LSI Logic's ownership, and sold 40 percent of the company to IBM and 11 percent to Prudential-Bache Securities. The new owners were not made public until February 1989 when there was unusual volatility in ACT's stock. As of March 1989, ACT (including InterACT) had about 140 employees. By 1990, the full SDE idea had been abandoned, and focus was instead placed on the administration tool that had been created. Dubbed the InterACT Integrator, it was hosted on Sun Microsystems workstations and positioned as a data management framework for the integration and automatic sequencing of CASE tools and other software packages. However it failed to find a market. Meanwhile, InterACT continued to develop and sell the Ada and JOVIAL products on their own. In 1988, the company made a licensing arrangement with MIPS Computer Systems to gain access to the compiler back end technology for the MIPS R3000 RISC microprocessor, and commenced work on an Ada cross compiler system for the R3000. First validated and released in late 1989, one of the first to do so, the Ada cross compiler product for MIPS R3000 made a number of sales. However, InterACT's business health continued to worsen and, starting in September 1989, there were a number of rounds of layoffs. In October 1991, it was announced that DDC-I had acquired the Ada and JOVIAL embedded systems business of InterACT. What remained of the SDE/Integrator business was shut down. Creative Socio- Medics 240px In 1973, ACT acquired Creative Socio-Medics (CSM), which had been founded by Gerald O. Koop and John F. Phillips in 1968. It specialized in delivering software products and hardware and software services in the human services field, specifically for behavioral health providers such as psychiatric hospitals and mental health clinics. These included large, networked installations, such as for the Psychiatric Institutes of America and the New Jersey Department of Human Services. The subsidiary also employed research analysts who studied behavioral health issues. Originally, CSM systems worked via batch processing. In the 1970s, CSM made the move to deploy its software to online minicomputer systems that were provided to customers as turnkey systems. Near the end of that decade, all of CSM's applications were converted to being implemented using the MUMPS programming language, which went on to become a common choice within the healthcare industry. For the most part, CSM operated independently of the rest of ACT's activities, but there were occasional collaborations, such as when the parent produced MUMPS implementations for the Digital Equipment Corporation PRO series microcomputers and Tandem Computers NonStop fault-tolerant product line, or when ACT's Network Processor product was used underneath CSM's Human Services Network Information System. Over time, CSM grew as a subsidiary corporation of ACT. It became a major contributor to ACT's overall financial picture and received prominent attention in ACT's annual reports throughout the 1980s. It tended to be profitable some years and not other years and was rarely in solid financial shape. In 1989, CSM stopped sharing physical facilities with the rest of ACT, and relocated to Islip, New York on Long Island. In June 1994, Creative Socio-Medics was sold to a company known as Carte Medical. For the Year Ended December 31, 1999. Fate Once CSM was sold, ACT had no remaining operations or assets, only lingering corporate debts. It took the money from the CSM sale and paid off its debtors a reasonably high partial amount on the dollar. As Schachter later said about ACT, \\"We just faded away. We never dissolved. We never declared bankruptcy ... we just kind of faded away.\\"Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 22‚Äì23. Former employees of ACT went on to work elsewhere on compilers and various kinds of system software. The most notable such endeavor was Edison Design Group. Founded by one of ACT's compiler designers J. Stephen Adamczyk in 1988, and with several ex-members of ACT's commercial compiler group working for it over the years, they produced a very successful front-end implementation for the C++ programming language and became well-regarded contributors to the ISO C++ standardization effort. After acquiring and rebranding the ACT/InterACT JOVIAL and Ada compiler products, DDC-I continued to develop and market them throughout the 1990s; they were still listed as legacy products on their website into the 2010s. Creative Socio-Medics became a success story. Carte Medical, the company that bought it in 1994, changed its corporate name to Netsmart Technologies in 1996 and went public later that year. Creative Socio-Medics remained the company's operations arm that it did business through. By the 2000s it was steadily profitable; after acquiring a large rival in 2005, the Creative Socio-Medics name was retired in favor of just Netsmart. The company sold for $115 million to a pair of private equity firms in 2007 and had 600 employees by 2011. In retrospect, Schachter said of working at Advanced Computer Techniques, \\"I thoroughly enjoyed being part of this group. They were a group of really bright people. It was a fun company to work for ... I am just sorry we weren't more successful than it turned out we were.\\"Haigh, An Interview with Oscar Schachter, pp. 26‚Äì27.

It officially began in August 2014. Overview Brig. Gen. Dick Olum, the leading commander of the UPDF troops in Somalia, addresses soldiers during Operation Indian Ocean Launched on 16 August 2014, Operation Indian Ocean is led by the Somali federal government and is aimed at eliminating the remaining insurgent-held areas in the countryside. On 1 September 2014, a U.S. airstrike carried out near the town of Haawaay as part of the broader mission killed Al-Shabaab leader Moktar Ali Zubeyr. U.S. authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab. Political analysts likewise suggested that the insurgent leader's death will likely lead to Al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution. In addition, the Somali government presented a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of the militant group. Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed announced that the pardon offer had begun to be taken up by many defectors. By October 2014, 700 Al-Shabaab members had surrendered to the state authorities. Among the latter militants was senior commander Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, who turned himself in to local police in the southwestern Gedo province in late December 2014. Sheikh Osman Sheikh Mohamed, the commander of Al-Shabaab's militia in the Luq area, as well as landmine expert Abdullahi Mohamed \\"Madoobe\\", and senior officer Bashaan Ali Hassan (\\"Mohamed Ali\\") followed suit and defected in early 2015. Additional senior Al-Shabaab commanders were also killed or died in combat. Among the slain militant leaders was intelligence chief Tahliil Abdishakur, who was killed in a U.S. drone airstrike in December 2014; commander Ibrahim Filey, who was killed during a skirmish with Somali army troops in January 2015; chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security Yusuf Dheeq, who was killed in a U.S. drone airstrike in January 2015; head of external operations and mastermind of the Westgate shopping mall attack Aden Garaar, who was killed in a U.S. drone airstrike in March 2015; and Gedo province commander Mohamed Musa, who was killed during a skirmish with Somali army troops in March 2015. Timeline =August 2014= 16 August *Hiraan region Governor Abdifatah Hassan Afrah indicates that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have liberated a number of towns in the region from the Al-Shabaab militants. Among the captured local areas are Abesale, Badi Keen, Buuq Goosaar, El Ade and Far Libah. 17 August *Somali national army forces assisted by AMISOM troops begin a major military operation against Al-Shabaab in central Somalia. The move comes 24 hours after the national chief of military announced the start of new offensives against the insurgent group. Hiran Governor Abdifatah Hassan indicates that the allied forces are slated to liberate the remaining parts of the province that are under militant control, and in the process remove roadblocks that the insurgents erected. An RBC Radio correspondent in Beledweyne also reports that the allied forces have left Buloburte in Hiran and are heading toward Burane in the Middle Shabelle province. Additionally, Hassan indicates that AMISOM's Ethiopian contingent left Elbur in the Galgadud province and are bound for Al-Shabaab controlled areas. 25 August Ugandan tank crews on 29 August *Somali government forces assisted by Ethiopian AMISOM troops capture Tiyeglow from Al-Shabaab. The offensive is part of a larger military cleanup operation dubbed \\"Operation Indian Ocean\\". Situated around 530 km northeast of Mogadishu along the main road linking Beledweyne and Baidoa, Tiyeglow previously served as a strategic base for the insurgent group. Witnesses indicate that the Al-Shabaab fighters mounted no resistance during the raid, fleeing instead to adjacent forested areas. According to AMISOM, the successful military operation deprives the insurgent group of high extortion fees that it would previously charge to vehicles traveling along the town's principal road. The siege also now gives the Somali government full control of the Bakool province. Additionally, AMISOM representatives indicate that, in an attempt to slow the allied forces' march, the insurgents planted roadside explosive devices before fleeing, which they were presently defusing. 30 August *General Abdirizak Khalif Elmi, frontline armed forces commander-in-chief, announces that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have seized Bulo Marer in the Lower Shabelle province from Al-Shabaab. Located between 115 km to 120 km south of Mogadishu, the town previously served as a strategic base and tax collection center for the insurgent group, from which it would launch attacks on other areas. According to witnesses, the militants mounted a heavy armed resistance, with the battle for control of the town lasting several hours. The joint allied forces also captured Goolweyn and Jerlio before heading to Bulo Marer. Government and AMISOM forces are now marching toward the port city of Barawe, Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold in the province. The militants reportedly already transported radio broadcasting equipment for the purpose. *Hiran Governor Abdifatah Hassan announces that the Somali National Army assisted by Djiboutian AMISOM forces are securing adjacent areas before entering Jalalaqsi in the Hiran province. Al-Shabaab militants had vacated the town the day before ahead of the allied forces' march. 31 August Uganda People's Defence Force soldiers during the operation *Heavily armed Al- Shabaab militants attack the Godka Jilacow prison in Mogadishu, a key interrogation center run by the National Intelligence and Security Agency. The raid is an apparent attempt to free other insurgents held at the facility. It begins when a vehicle carrying explosives detonates at the prison gates, with militants armed with guns and grenades then attempting to penetrate the compound. According to Somali police Capt. Mohamed Hussein, prison guards manage to repel the attack, killing all of the attackers. Witnesses also report that no prisoners have escaped. Ministry of National Security spokesman Mohamed Yusuf Osman indicates that seven Al-Shabaab fighters, three security guards and one civilian were killed during the gunfight. Al-Shabaab later claims responsibility for the attack. *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM soldiers begin a military offensive against Al-Shabaab insurgents in the Middle Shabelle province. According to regional Governor Ali Mohamud Gudlawe, the march is part of a larger, nationwide security cleanup operation to remove the militants from their remaining bastions. The joint forces are reportedly heading from Mahaday to villages situated near the local river, with residents indicating that an allied convoy is making its way toward the principal corridor adjoining the Hiran province. Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Mus‚Äôab states that his group will try and halt the government and AMISOM forces' advance by laying siege to towns that the allied forces have liberated. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud a few hours later orders a full public inquiry into the attack. *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture Fidow in Middle Shabelle from Al-Shabaab. It is situated 60 km from the provincial capital Jowhar. The militants reportedly vacated the village ahead of the raid. *Somali government forces and AMISOM troops seize Kurtunwaarey in Lower Shabelle from Al-Shabaab. It is situated 20 km west of the Bulo Marer district. The militants reportedly vacated the town before the arrival of the allied forces. =September 2014= 1 September *Arriving from the Middle Shabelle regional capital of Jowhar, Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops from the Burundian contingent capture Kililka Shiinaha and Dhiin Garas from Al-Shabaab. According to Somali National Army mobilizer Abdirizak Khalif Elmi, the allied forces are now heading toward Jalalaqsi. Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur Siidi also indicates that the joint forces will lay siege to the Al-Shabaab bastions of Saakow and Bu'ale in the Middle Jubba province. *U.S. military forces conduct an operation against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby indicates that they are still assessing the raid's impact. Masked militants subsequently begin mass arrests of local residents under charges of spying. Additionally, a senior Somali intelligence official states that the U.S. drone strike was targeting the Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane (Moktar Ali Zubeyr) as he was leaving a gathering of the group's senior commanders. The meeting was reportedly over the ongoing joint offensive by Somali military and AMISOM forces against Al-Shabaab's remaining bastions. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official adds that the attack occurred in a forest adjacent to Sablale district, and also suggests that Godane may have been killed during the drone strike. U.S. officials later clarify that the strike was carried out via both drone and manned aircraft, with U.S. special operations forces destroying a vehicle and training camp using laser-guided munitions and Hellfire missiles. According to a U.S. government source, a Twitter account that was linked by American authorities to Al-Shabaab also declared that Godane had died during the raid. While the Arabic tweet's authenticity is being analyzed, Godane does not appear in any social media or other public outlet to confirm that he is still alive. Experts suggest that his death would trigger a power struggle within the militant group to fill the leadership void, and may ultimately lead to its fragmentation. 3 September *Following a cabinet meeting, the federal government announces a 45-day ultimatum to Al-Shabaab members to surrender, disarm and renounce violence. According to Minister of National Security Khalif Ahmed Ereg, any individual who ignores the directive will be held legally accountable. The cabinet also calls on local Islamic scholars and society members to assist in convincing young militants to leave Al-Shabaab and join the peace process. *The Hiran regional administration announces that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have driven Al-Shabaab completely out of the Hiran province. The allied forces are now slated to open the road between Beledweyne and Bulobarte. Additionally, they are marching toward the remaining areas under militant control, including Barawe where a number of Al-Shabaab commanders reportedly reside. 5 September *The Pentagon press secretariat Rear Adm. John Kirby confirms that Godane was killed in the U.S. airstrike. He describes the militant leader's death as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab, the result of years of intelligence, military and law enforcement work. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud states that all of Godane's companions were also killed during the operation, which he indicates was conducted with the full knowledge and consent of the Somali federal government. He also reiterates his administration's 45-day offer of amnesty to all moderate Al-Shabaab members who choose to renounce violence and disavow links with the insurgent group and its Al-Qaeda affiliate. Additionally, Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed announces that the attack was targeting Godane's convoy near the town of Haawaay, and was an official joint operation between U.S. and Somali forces. He likewise asserts that the insurgent commander's death will help the reconstruction efforts in Somalia to proceed unimpeded. Abdi Aynte, Director of the Mogadishu-based Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, suggests that Godane's killing will likely mark the start of the end for Al-Shabaab. The Muslim scholars association in Somalia also issues a statement welcoming the progress made by the Somali National Army and AMISOM troops to eliminate the insurgent group. 6 September Somali Army soldiers during the operation *The Ministry of National Security of Somalia issues a public warning of possible retaliatory attacks by Al-Shabaab insurgents for the killing of their leader Godane. The national security agencies are also reportedly placed on alert to respond to any threats by the militant group. *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture remaining villages in the Bakool region from Al-Shabaab. The seized areas include Biyeeleey, Sakaaroole and War-galoole in the Tiyeglow district. According to Col. Abdullahi Mohamed Ugaas, the battle lasted several hours, with at least ten insurgents killed. Al-Shabaab does not comment on the casualties. Ugaas also indicates that the allied forces impounded vehicles and weapons belonging to the militants. *Al- Shabaab acknowledge that its leader Ahmed Abdi Godane has been killed in a joint U.S.-Somalia operation. The militants concurrently appoint Ahmad Umar (Abu Ubaidah) as his replacement. *Somali government forces assisted by Ethiopian troops seize El Garas in the Galguduud province from Al-Shabaab. According to the Somali military spokesman Mohamed Kariye Roble, the village was a main base for the insurgent group, serving as both a springboard from which it would launch attacks and a supply storage area. 13 September *Somali government forces and AMISOM troops capture Aboreey, Moqokori, Yasooman and Muuse-geel villages in the Bulobarte district from Al-Shabaab. The militants mount no resistance. *Somali government forces and AMISOM troops seize Abooto-barrey, Ceel-Sheel, Carraale and Kaawada villages in the Galguduud province's El Bur district from Al-Shabaab. *The French magazine Le Point reports that French intelligence services assisted the U.S. military in its airstrike that killed Al-Shabaab commander Godane. According to the weekly, the French authorities, including President Fran√ßois Hollande, provided support in the form of intelligence and coordination. Among other information, French intelligence officials reportedly forwarded to the Pentagon details as to which exact truck the militant leader was being transported in and on which road he was traveling. France reportedly holds Godane responsible for the abduction of two French intelligence agents in 2009, which ended in the execution of one of the officials, Denis Allex, after an unsuccessful rescue attempt by commandos in 2013. *AMISOM forces conducted several targeted in-depth operations around the town of Badhadhe in Lower Juba region in a village called Lagta Berta targeting two camps where Al-Shabaab militiamen train. During the raid, Al-Shabaab suffered heavy losses, including foreign fighters. Many Al-Shabaab militias were also wounded in the attack which completely destroyed the facility which was a hideout for the terrorists. 27 September Ugandan troops set up a forward base after capturing an area from militants during the operation *The National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) offers a $2 million reward to any individual who provides information leading to the arrest of the new Al- Shabaab leader, Ahmed Omar Abu Ubeyda. According to the NISA Commander Abdirahman Mohamed Turyare, a separate $1 million would be rewarded to any person who supplies information that could result in the killing of Ubeyda. Turyare also pledges that the informers' identities would be kept private. This is reportedly the first time that a Somalia security official is offering such large dead-or-alive bounties on an Al-Shabaab leader. 30 September *Somali National Army forces and AMISOM troops capture Raage Ceelle from Al-Shabaab. The strategic town is located around 100 km north of Mogadishu, in the Middle Shabelle province. The allied forces reportedly move into the area after seizing Warshiikh, and encounter no resistance once they enter Raage Ceelle. =October 2014= 1 October *Somali National Army forces assisted by AMISOM troops seize Maryan-Gubaay village, situated around 60 km from Barawe in Lower Shabelle. According to the province's Governor Abdukadir Nur Siidii, the raid is part of a major operation by the allied forces to secure the area. Federal security officials also estimate that around 500 Al-Shabaab fighters have defected to the government since Operation Indian Ocean was launched in August of the year. The joint forces have captured all of the Bulo Marer district in Lower Shabelle, as well as new areas in the province's Barawe district. They are now reportedly heading toward Barawe, Al-Shabaab's largest remaining bastion. *Somali government forces and AMISOM troops capture Adale from Al-Shabaab. The strategic town is located 222 km northeast of Mogadishu, and had served as one of two areas in the Middle Shabelle province from which the militants would launch attacks. The insurgents reportedly vacated Adale ahead of the raid, which is part of an intensified push by the joint forces against Al-Shabaab. According to residents, the troops entered the town from the direction of adjacent Haji Ali. 2 October *Kenyan AMISOM fighter jets launch airstrikes on Al- Shabaab bases near the Jilib district in Middle Juba. Independent sources indicate that the attack has caused significant casualties among the militants. However, neither Al-Shabaab nor the Kenyan forces issue statements on the raid. 3 October *Al-Shabaab militants reportedly vacate Barawe ahead of a raid by Somali government forces and AMISOM troops. According to local residents, the insurgents began to depart from the town in the morning, indicated that they would return, and threatened to decapitate anyone found assisting the joint forces. Barawe is situated 150 km from Mogadishu in the Lower Shabelle province, and was the insurgent group's largest remaining bastion. 5 October *Somali government officials announce that Somali military forces assisted by AMISOM troops have captured Barawe from Al- Shabaab. The port town is situated in the Lower Shabelle province, around 180 km (110 miles) south of Mogadishu. It was the militant group's largest remaining stronghold and served as a strategic hideout, revenue center, and training base for the outfit for the past several years. While many of the insurgents began vacating the area yesterday after getting word of the approaching joint forces, a number reportedly stayed behind to defend their positions. According to the Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nuur Sidii, Al-Shabaab sustained at least 13 fatalities in the ensuing battle, while two of the allied soldiers were wounded. The Somali military official Abdi Mire also confirms that the army is now in full control of Barawe. Most of the soldiers are garrisoned on the outskirts of the city, with a few stationed inside. Additionally, the Governor indicates that the situation is calm, and that the regional administration is slated to meet with local residents and traditional elders. Al-Shabaab military operations spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab does not issue a statement with regard to the militants vacating Barawe. He instead asserts that the insurgents incinerated two government vehicles in an area close to the town, an ambush which the AU indicates was unsuccessful. 6 October African Union enter Barawe amid minimal resistance by al-Shabaab fighters on 6 October *Jubba interim administration forces assisted by Kenyan AMISOM troops push Al-Shabaab out of Buulogudud and several other local areas. The village is situated 30 km west of Kismayo, the Lower Jubba province's capital. Al-Shabaab militants vacated the area without mounting a resistance. The attack and other raids against the insurgent group come after the conclusion of a reconciliation conference in Kismayo. Jubaland President Ahmed Madobe also issues a 48-hour ultimatum to the militants to surrender. Kenyan AMISOM spokesman David Obonyo indicates that 22 Al-Shabaab fighters were killed during the offensive, while three Somali National Army soldiers and one Kenyan troop were wounded. He also says that the joint forces impounded weapons and ammunition and demolished three vehicles. Additionally, they have captured the Yoontoy and Koban localities. The allied forces are now heading toward the Jilib and Jamame districts and remaining areas nearby where Al-Shabaab maintains bases and training grounds. According to Jubaland spokesman Abdinasir Serar Mah, they are approaching Jilib, Bu'alle, Saakow and Salagle. 8 October *Jubaland forces and AMISOM troops seize Mugaanbow, Baar Sanguuni and Bangeenni in Lower Jubba from Al-Shabaab. Kenyan fighter jets also launch airstrikes during the raid, though the number of casualties is uncertain. According to Jubaland commander Adan Gojar, the joint forces are now marching toward Kabsuma, situated 90 km north of Kismayo and Jilib. Although the militants have reportedly severed telecommunication lines in Jilib, the allied forces are also nearing Jana Abdale. 9 October *Interim Juba administration forces assisted by AMISOM launch cleanup operations in Hagar locality and other areas in the Lower Juba province. According to officials, the aim is to secure local areas vacated by Al-Shabaab. Correspondents in the area report that the allied forces clashed in some parts of the region with the militants. The joint forces are now marching toward Jilib district. 23 October *Al-Shabaab militants attack Somali government forces' positions in Sabiib near the Afgooye district. According to the village's governor Mayow Mayow, the government troops manage to successfully repel the insurgents. Casualties are reported, but the exact number is unspecified. The area is calm the following day, with government forces in pursuit of Al-Shabaab remnants in the vicinity. 24 October *Interim Jubba Administration (IJA) forces capture Biroole in the Lower Jubba region from Al-Shabaab. The village is a key area, linking the Jubba Valley with the North Eastern Province. According to the IJA spokesman Abdinasir Serar, the Interim Jubba Administration forces slew four Al-Shabaab militants during the raid, but he did not specify the number of IJA casualties. 25 October *Interim Juba Administration forces and AMISOM troops seize Kuda Island from Al-Shabaab. The island is located around 170 km from the Lower Juba capital of Kismayo. According to IJA security officials, seven militants were killed in the skirmish, while two soldiers from the allied forces were slain and one was wounded. They also indicate that they have impounded weapons and military vehicles. The joint forces are now reportedly carrying out local security operations. They are also set to march toward remaining Al-Shabaab bases in the Kulbiyow and Badhade localities. 28 October *President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission for Somalia and Head of AMISOM Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, State Minister for Defence Mohamed Ali Hagaa, Deputy Minister for Public Works and Reconstruction Mohamed Ismail Shurie, senior Somali National Army officers, and AMISOM military officials hold a press conference briefing the media on the progress of Operation Indian Ocean. Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff General Abdirisak therein provides a military campaign map and indicates that the mission focused on coastal areas where Al-Shabaab still had a foothold. The joint forces in the process captured eight strategic towns since the launch of the operation, with more about to fall. According to Sidikou, the southern port town of Koday was seized just 48 hours earlier by Somali forces, who received surveillance and logistical support from their UN and AMISOM partners. The capture reportedly further prevents Al-Shabaab from entering, exiting and re-arming themselves through seaport access. Additionally, Bula Haji and other small Lower Juba villages have also been liberated. Sidikou also indicates that Al-Shabaab now only controls a few major towns in the south. Among these settlements are Jilib, Jamame, Buale and Sakow in the Middle Juba province, Bardere in the Gedo province, and Diinsor in the Bay province, in addition to a few smaller towns such as El-Dere in the Middle Shabelle province. *Interim Juba Administration forces and AMISOM troops reportedly capture Abdalla Biroole and other areas in the Lower Juba province from Al-Shabaab. According to IJA spokesman Abdinasir Serar Maah, the joint forces in the process confiscate weapons and military vehicles from the insurgents. Kenyan AMISOM officials also indicate that they targeted Al-Shabaab hideouts and bases in the province, with airstrikes reportedly carried out. Casualty figures are uncertain. Additionally, Al-Shabaab do not issue a statement on the IJA raid. *President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud offers an extra 60-day amnesty period to all Al-Shabaab fighters who renounce the militant group and its ideology. The offer comes immediately after the expiration of the government's initial 45-day amnesty window, during which over 700 insurgents reportedly defected. The new amnesty period is valid from 1 November to 31 December. 29 October *Somali government forces assisted by Ethiopian AMISOM troops repel a nighttime raid by Al-Shabaab militants in the central town of El Garas. According to national army spokesman Mohamed Kariye Roble, the allied forces kill three insurgents during the skirmish. *Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a senior official Mohamed Yusuf Al-Qadhi announces that his group and Somali government forces aim to capture Bardhere district in the Gedo province from Al-Shabaab. The provincial capital of Bardhere is the militant group's last local bastion. Al-Qadhi adds that seizing the area will be facilitated by the small number of Al-Shabaab fighters left in the town. Additionally, he indicates that Somali government forces and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a troops have already captured many other areas from the insurgents. 30 October *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops seize new areas in the Galgadud province from Al-Shabaab.

Lankesh to contribute to his newly started tabloid Lankesh Patrike.

The Charitable Trust also provided funds to support the use and growth of the Cary Collection, which has expanded almost 20-fold since its inception, and now includes materials related to the history of writing, the art of calligraphy, the formats and printing of early books, the design of typefaces, the technology of printing, the practice of paper-making, the art of the book and artists' books.

History Heritage High School opened in 2010 in response to rapid population growth throughout Wake Forest. During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, the campus was used by the students and staff of Wake Forest-Rolesville High School while their campus underwent renovations. When Heritage opened, it was armed with a top-level administration team and well-respected educators from a variety of surrounding high schools, including former Wakefield High School principal Dr. Mark Savage. Two other Heritage employees of note came from Wakefield: Dean of Students Deirdra Williams and Athletic Director Patrick Kennedy. When Heritage first opened, it was only occupied by students in 9th and 10th grades. In this first year, Heritage trotted out varsity teams in every sport with the exception of football. In the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, the building was three-fourths occupied due to the addition of another freshman class. The school was finally filled with all four classes in the 2012‚Äì2013 school year. The 2012-2013 year also marked Heritage's first-ever graduating class. On July 19, 2016 the Wake County Public School System announced that Heritage principle Dr. Mark Savage would be promoted to the Western Area Superintendent and former Enloe principal, Mr. Scott Lyons would be moved to Heritage to become the school's second principal. =Early accolades= After the first graduating class, Dr. Mark Savage was named WCPSS Principal of the Year in 2013,http://www.wral.com/heritage-high-leader-named- wake-principal-of-year/13009154/ an impressive accomplishment for a new high school.

Schedule The school year at Heritage High School starts in late August and ends in early June. The class schedule, commonly referred to as \\"block scheduling\\", has four different classes each semester, each period being approximately ninety minutes long. This completes a course in one semester instead of one year and provides four new classes in the second semester. Students take exams in mid-January and again in early June. Heritage High School operates on the three lunch, or A, B, C Lunch system. All lunches are 40 minutes long, and juniors and seniors are permitted to drive off campus.

He is best known for his time in WWE, where he performed on NXT, under the ring name Bull Dempsey. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2005‚Äì2013)= Smith made his debut on October 28, 2005, at East Coast Professional Wrestling event under the ring name Donnie \\"The Body\\" Johnson, where he lost to Ace Wylde. Over the next five months, Smith wrestled in National Wrestling Alliance as Baby Hughie. On September 26, 2009, at NWA New Jersey The Dennis Coralluzzo Invitational 2009, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) defeated The Varsity Club (Baby Hughie and Rob Eckos). In 2010, Smith changed his ring name to Smith James. On July 21, 2011, James defeated Memphis Mofo in a TNA dark match. In 2012, James joined The New Age Wrecking Crew with Bill Carr, Stockade and Vince Steele. On March 10, 2012, Steele and James entered in a tournament to crown a new ACE Tag team Champions, but were defeated in the finals by The Movement. On March 9, 2013, James and Vince Steele won the American Championship Entertainment (ACE) Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles on May 11, 2013. On February 23, 2013, James and Bill Carr won the NYWC Tag Team Championship. However, they lost the title against Mikey Whipwreck and Stockade on June 23, 2013, his last match in the company. =WWE (2013‚Äì2016)= In June 2013, James signed a contract with WWE. He was assigned to the WWE Performance Center. On August 28, 2013, his name was changed to Bull Dempsey. Dempsey made his debut in NXT on September 12, 2013, where he was defeated by Aiden English. Throughout late 2013, he made sporadic appearances as an enhancement talent. In the late spring to summer, Dempsey returned to NXT as a tweener, squashing various low carders and local talents. In August, Dempsey and Mojo Rawley formed an uneasy tag team and participated in the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament, where they were defeated by The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) in the first round, prompting Dempsey to attack Rawley in the aftermath and establishing himself a heel. On September 11 at the NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way event, Dempsey defeated Rawley in a squash with his new finisher The Diving Headbutt. On the September 25 episode of NXT, Bull was victorious in the rematch. Following that, he embarked on a rivalry with Baron Corbin, another dominant wrestler who mostly squashed jobbers. The two competed to see how quickly they could defeat the \\"local talent\\", sometimes back-to-back. This eventually led to a match between the two on January 14, 2015, in which Dempsey's undefeated streak was broken by Corbin. Dempsey competed in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Qualification Tournament at WrestleMania Axxess 31, but lost to Tyler Breeze in the first round. Soon after this, Dempsey's gimmick was tweaked to that of an overweight, out of shape wrestler who eats too much, which also saw him turn face in the process. After several vignettes aired to promote \\"Bull-Fit\\", Dempsey debuted his new gimmick on the August 26 episode of NXT, where he defeated Elias Samson. On the February 24 episode of NXT, he was defeated by Tommaso Ciampa. On the March 23 episode of NXT, he and his supposed opponent Danny Burch both got beaten down by Samoa Joe, before they even started the match, this led to a match between Dempsey and Joe on the following weeks episode. Dempsey lost in a quick squash match by disqualification because Joe kept his finisher, the Coquina Clutch, on Dempsey prompting NXT General Manager William Regal to try to stop him. Samoa Joe's insubordination would bring NXT Champion Finn B√°lor to the ring to \\"rescue\\" Dempsey. The following week Dempsey lost to Joe in a squash match, this was Dempsey's final appearance for NXT. On February 5, 2016, Dempsey announced on the social network Twitter that he had been released from WWE. =Independent circuit (2016‚Äìpresent)= James began wrestling on the independent circuit following his release from NXT, using the name Bull James, a combination of his NXT name and his birth name. James announced that he was set to debut in Combat Zone Wrestling, stating that he was coming after Sami Callihan, also known as Solomon Crowe, facing him on March 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txOjA3O_R7U On February 25, 2017, James won the NYWC Heavyweight Championship at Psycho Circus XV. On February 24, 2018, James lost the title to Alex Reynolds at Psycho Circus XVI only to regain it on March 31, 2018 at Aftermath. James lost the title to King Mega on June 30, 2018 at Going The Distance. On March 11, 2017, James won the SWF Cruiserweight Title at SWF Legacies Never Die. = Ring of Honor (2016) = On September 18, 2016, James made a surprise debut in Ring of Honor's Honor Rumble, making it to the final four. On October 21, 2016, James faced ROH World Champion Adam Cole, in a losing effort. The following day James teamed up with Mr. Wrestling III losing to B.J. Whitmer and Punisher Martinez. James was defeated by Silas Young.

It was one of several community-based health organizations that emerged in response to the AIDS crisis. Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida emerged from a variety of organizations that aimed at reducing the spread of HIV in communities of color. Some of the predecessor organizations of PCPV were the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention (NTFAP), the Gay Latino Alliance (GALA), and Community United in Responding to AIDS/SIDA (CURAS), among others. Some of the leaders who came together to create PCPV included Ricardo Bracho, Diane Felix, Jesse Johnson, Hector Le√≥n, Reggie Williams, and Mart√≠n Ornellas- Quintero.  Contributions to activist methodologies  Three components distinguished PCPV's unique contribution to LGBT organizations and AIDS advocacy efforts: a commitment to multi-gender organizing, sex-positive programming, and principles of harm reduction. Operated from 1993 to 2005, the agency had emerged from the CURAS (Community Responding to AIDS/SIDA) and targeted those under-served by existing HIV-prevention resources, including transgender women, Spanish-speaking immigrants, Latino youth, and neighborhood sex workers. PCPV was committed to new forms of community building. It promoted health education by addressing differences in age, language, class, immigrant status, and gender. Its dynamic approach to community engagement, education, and outreach was inspired by Paulo Freire, the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham, ACT-UP, and El movimiento de liberaci√≥n gay based in Mexico City. PCPV's approach, programming, and materials were characterized by multilingualism, neologism, bold social marketing, and enacting cultural fluency.Rodr√≠guez, Juana Mar√≠a. Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces. New York: NYU Press, 2003. Organized as a constellation of community agents committed to creative care-taking and activist intervention, PCPV served as a springboard for many notable Latinx artists, activists, academics, and allies. The distinctive tone of its mission statement, drafted by Chicano playwright Ricardo Bracho, captures the multi-lingual flavor and political urgency of the group's radical vision: > Proyecto ContraSIDA is coming to you‚Äîyou joto, you macha, you vestigial, you > queer, you femme, you girls and boys and boygirls and girlboys de ambiente, > con la f√© and fearlessness that we can combat AIDS, determine our own > destinos, and love ourselves and each other con dignidad, humor, y lujuria. This mission statement recognizes the complex and culturally specific ways in which people identify their gender and sexuality. The organization's name includes references to two important concepts in Chicana/o street culture, \\"con safos\\", often written as C/S, and por vida, often written as P/V.Phillips, Susan A. \\"Crip Walk, Villain Dance, Pueblo Stroll: The Embodiment of Writing in African American Gang Dance.\\" Anthropological Quarterly 82.1 (2009): 69‚Äì97.

Scholarly attention PCPV's model of innovative community engagement attracted the attention of several scholars, some of whom had formal and informal ties to the organization. University of California, Berkeley professor, Juana Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez devotes a chapter of her book Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces to the organization, focusing on its inventive use of linguistic and visual practices, and outlining how PCPV organizing practices challenged existing identity-based models of community engagement. Oral historian Horacio Roque Ramirez documents the lives of numerous PCPV members including Diane Felix, and outlines the related cultural and social movements that contributed to its formation, in his 2001 dissertation \\"Communities of Desire: Queer Latina/Latino History and Memory, San Francisco Bay Area, 1960-1990s\\" and in numerous other articles.Roque-Ramirez, Horacio N. \\"Communities of Desire: Queer Latina/Latino History and Memory, San Francisco Bay Area, 1960s-1990s,\\" University of California, Berkeley Dissertation, 2001.Roque-Ramirez, Horacio N. \\"'Mira, Yo Soy Boricua Y Estoy Aqu√≠': Rafa Negr√≥n's Pan Dulce and the Queer Sonic Latinaje of San Francisco.\\" Centro Journal XIX.1 275‚Äì313.

Project MUSE. Web. In 2004, Jaime Cortez produced a bilingual graphic novel, Sexilio/Sexile about Adela Vazquez and credits \\"the diasporic folk of Proyecto Village\\" with the inspiration for that project. Several healthcare advocates have also noted the importance of the PCPV's approach to community well-being and HIV prevention, stressing the impact of its \\"bottom-up\\" approach, and its ability to reach and serve marginalized communities.Ochoa Camacho, Ariana, Yep, Gust A., Gomez, Prado Y., and Velez, Elissa. \\"El Poder Y La Fuerza de La Pasi√≥n: Toward a Model of HIV/AIDS Education and Service Delivery from the 'Bottom-Up.'\\" In Emerging Perspectives in Health Communication: Meaning, Culture, and Power, edited by Heather Zoller and Mohan J.

After PCPV closed, several of its staff and volunteers went on to create El/La Para Translatinas, an organization dedicated to supporting and advocating for transgender Latinas. The archives of PCPV are currently held in the Ethnic Studies Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

It is the city's oldest existing cemetery. History The cemetery was established in 1826 at what was then the edge of the city, taking its name from East 9th Street's original name. It was the city's first permanent cemetery, replacing a community burial ground just south of Public Square. Many of Cleveland's earliest pioneers and leaders are buried there, including Lorenzo Carter, the city's first permanent white settler; and John W. Willey, the city's first mayor. The cemetery was open to members of all faiths. During the administration of Mayor Tom L. Johnson in the early 20th century, bodies were moved from the cemetery to the municipally-owned Highland Park Cemetery, and parts of the cemetery were vacated for city streets. The Pioneers' Memorial Association was formed in 1915 to advocate for the cemetery. In 1925, its future was secured when City Manager William R. Hopkins decided to build the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge around, rather than through, the cemetery. Improvements and maintenance have been performed by groups including the Works Progress Administration and the Cleveland Grays. It was designated as an official Ohio historical site in October 2009, and it is a Cleveland City Landmark. Honors students at Cuyahoga Community College have conducted research about people buried in the cemetery. Notable interments Among the cemetery's more than 17,000 interments are veterans who participated in conflicts from the Revolutionary War through the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.

Some of his works, such as St Agnes and Music are seen as precursors of the Art Nouveau movement. His works were seen as having both a Japanese and Pre-Raphaelite influence upon them. Biography St Agnes by David Gauld 1889, National Gallery of Scotland Portrait head by David Gauld, 1893 Gauld was born in Glasgow and served an apprenticeship as a lithographer and stained glass designer under Stephen Adamhttp://www.victorianweb.org/art/stainedglass/adam/gailbraith.html and then attended Glasgow School of Art from 1882 to 1885. He came to public notice in the 1880s when he supplied a series of Japanese-influenced pen and ink drawings for the Glasgow Weekly Citizen. Gauld shared the Castlemains Studio in Kirkcudbright with William Stewart MacGeorge and then in later life shared a studio with Harrington Mann at 31 St Vincent Street in Glasgow from 1891 to 1894. During this time he designed stained glass windows for Guthrie and Wells. In 1895 Gauld appears to have split from Mann, and their friendship ended. Gauld then took new premises at 138 West George Street in Glasgow.Glasgow stained glass, by Michael Donnelly He also lived at various locations in Kirkcudbright, Glasgow and North Berwick. In 1889 he returned to the Glasgow School of Art and also studied in Paris for a period that year. Like other artists from Glasgow, Gauld spent time at the artists colony at Grez-sur-Loing in France. He was elected an Associate member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1918 and became a full member of the Academy in 1924.artistsfootsteps.co.uk He was sculpted by William Shirreffs in 1896.

So, the phrase \\"Ganju Pindi\\" can be described as rice flour that is made like atta flour and stick to the round shaped pan. In Warangal, the dish is known as \\"ginnappa\\". The village Bollepally in Warangal district is particularly famous for ginnappa (sarva pindi), as the story about ginnappa first originated from the Challa Anasurya house in the village. A few years back, Anasurya was feeling very hungry in rainy season, but desired a new dish with less oil. As she had only rice flour in her home at the time, this led to the creation of the sarva pindi snack. She began to sell some in Bollepally village,Telangana district, With help of persons for some days like that entire Telugu people came to know about sarva pindi snack. Ingredients Sarva pindi is essentially made of rice flour, channa dal (lentil), peanuts and spices, making it a delicious and healthy dish. Etymology The word Sarva Pindi comes from a combination of two terms: \\"sarva\\", meaning a deep pot or pan; and \\"appa\\", meaning a cake-sort of preparation. Therefore, the direct translation of Sarva pindi is the \\"pan cake\\". The Sarva Pindi pancake is one of the ethnic dishes from the Telangana cuisine.

They operated primarily between St. Louis, Missouri and Peoria, Illinois in the late 1940s and early to mid-1950s. They were the last interurban cars manufactured in the United States.  Design  The St. Louis Car Company constructed all three sets. Each equipment set comprised three cars. The cars were constructed of fluted aluminum, painted in royal blue. Each car was independently powered by four traction motors. Top speed was .  Service  The streamliners represented a last attempt by the Illinois Terminal to regain lost passenger traffic and were the first new passenger cars the railroad had ordered since 1918. The Illinois Terminal began teasing the new streamliners in 1947, but did not announce the order until May 1948. Its original plan was to place all three in service between St. Louis and Peoria. The first new train in service was the City of Decatur, which began operating between St. Louis, Missouri and Decatur, Illinois (not Peoria) on November 7, 1948. It was the first through service offered by the Illinois Terminal between those two cities. By March 1950 all three sets were in operation. The other two, the Fort Crevecoeur and Mound City, were on the St. Louis‚ÄìPeoria route as originally planned. All three trains offered parlor and \\"√Ä la carte\\" dining service. The two streamliners made the trip in 4 hours 40 minutes, forty minutes faster than conventional interurbans on the route. Poor patronage led the Illinois Terminal to withdraw the City of Decatur in August 1950; the equipment was reassigned to the Peoria run. The new service was named Sangamon, which was the railroad's original choice in 1947. All three sets were withdrawn by 1956 when passenger service on the Illinois Terminal ended.

Chung initiated a decades long investigation into the July 1950 No Gun Ri Massacre by elements of the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the early days of the Korean War. Survivors estimated 100 people were killed in the No Gun Ri air attack and another 300 refugees died in attacks under a nearby railroad bridge. Chung Eun-yong's four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter were among the victims killed, while his wife, Park Sun-yong, suffered serious injuries. Chung Eun-yong, who returned to his pre-war job as a police officer in Daejeon in the mid-1950s, learned that the United States was accepting claims for damages related to the Korean War in 1960. He joined with several survivors of the No Gun Ri Massacre, but the group missed the application deadline. Chung quietly continued to gather evidence at archives in Seoul and Daejeon for the next three decades during South Korea's authoritarian military rule. Professionally, he worked for a government agency which combated potential Communist threats to South Korea. He also partnered to operate a small bottle manufacturing plant in Daejeon. He retired in the 1980s. Still the loss of his children never left him. He was later quoted by the Associated Press, \\"No Gun Ri never escaped my mind one single day.\\" In early 1990s, South Korea's military dictatorship was replaced by a democratic government. By this time, Chung Eun-yong had concluded, through his research, that the 1st Cavalry Division, the parent unit of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, bore the responsibility for the No Gun Ri Massacre. Chung concluded that South Korea's transition to democracy had finally given him the opportunity to speak out on the No Gun Ri Massacre for the first time since the 1960s. A wrote a novel, \\"Do You Know Our Agony?\\", based on the events of the No Gun Ri, but it was rejected by ten different publishers due to the controversial nature of his charges. The book was finally published in 1994. In October 1999, after release of the Associated Press report confirming the No Gun Ri refugee killings, Chung Eun- yong, leader of the survivors committee, reads a petition in Seoul, South Korea, calling for a \`\`truthful and speedy‚Äô‚Äô investigation.Chung Eun-yong also began a series of petitions to the American government in the early 1990s. He demanded a full investigation, an apology and compensation for survivors and victim's families. His petitions were ignored or dismissed until a 1999 investigation by Associated Press uncovered evidence which corroborated the accusations of Chung and other survivors. The Associated Press interviewed U.S. veterans who were near the site of the massacre and found declassified U.S. files stating that commanders had ordered their forces to shoot civilians in the war zone. While other news organizations, U.S. News & World Report, founded flaws with the AP's investigation, including an false eyewitness account by veteran Edward L. Daily, who was later proven not to have been at No Gun Ri, the AP investigation strengthened Chung's claims. Chung's petitions and the AP's stories caused American and South Korean authorities to launch an investigation. The United States Army first acknowledged the killings at No Gun Ri in January 2001, but did not assign blame for the massacre. U.S. President Bill Clinton issued a statement of regret concerning No Gun Ri, but did not offer a formal apology. No compensation was offered to victims or survivors at the time. Chung and his allies called the investigation a \\"whitewash.\\" The also rejected a U.S. offers to set up a scholarship fund and build a monument at No Gun Ri, which would have been dedicated to all of the Korean War's civilian victims rather than a specific memorial to those killed at No Gun Ri. The South Korean National Assembly created a committee to identify No Gun Ri victims in 2004. In 2005, the committee found 163 dead or missing victims and fifty-five wounded, while noting that reports were not submitted on many additional victims. Lawmakers also gave medical subsidies for survivors and established No Gun Ri Peace Park, a 29-acre park at the site, in 2004. In 1999, Chung joined with American veterans of No Gun Ri at a reconciliation service held at a church in Cleveland, Ohio. Chung Eun-yong was born in Chu Gok Ri, Korea, in 1923. He wanted to be an architect, but only had the money to attend railroad school. He became a telegraph operator for the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea, but left the job following a fistfight with a Japanese co-worker. He joined the Korean National Police in 1944 to avoid being drafted into the Japanese Army during World War II. Shortly after joining the police, Chung married his wife, Park Sun-yong, in an arranged marriage, which he been set up by a fortune teller. He quit the police in 1949, citing corruption, and enrolled at law school in Seoul. The outbreak of the Korean War cut short his studies. Chung Eun-yong, who had been in declining health, died on August 1, 2014, at his home in Daejeon, South Korea, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife of 69 years, Park Sun- yong, and a son born after the Korean War, Chung Koo-do. Chung Koo-do is the chairman of the No Gun Ri International Peace Foundation, which operates the No Gun Ri Peace Park.

The Wadham family originated at the manor of Wadham in the parish of Knowstone,Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p. 422 in North Devon. Wadeham was a manor recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as held in-chief from King William the Conqueror by the Saxon thane Ulf, who had held it since before the Norman Conquest of 1066.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 1, 52,40 Such continuing holdings by Saxons after the Conquest are very rare, and Ulf in 1086 is still described as one of \\"The King's Thanes\\", so clearly was serving the new Norman king satisfactorily. The Wadhams other Devon seat, in the South of the county, was Edge in the parish of Branscombe. The house was demolished in 1618. The rectangular moat remains and an area which may have been an associated fishpond for the supply of food to the household, particularly according to religious usage during Lent and on Fridays. In 1524 King Henry VIII granted a licence to empark to his courtier Sir Nicholas I Wadham (d. 1542), who had been present at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, for him to make a park of of woodland and of woodland. The deer park so created was situated immediately to the east of the moated site. The last of the family in the senior male line was Nicholas II Wadham (1531‚Äì1609), who posthumously with his widow Dorothy Petre, founded Wadham College, Oxford in 1610. Monuments to the Wadham family survive in St Peter's Church, Ilton and also on a grander scale in nearby St Mary's Church, Ilminster. The three sisters of Nicholas Wadham were (in their issue) his heirs, one of whom was Florence Wadham (died 1596), wife of Sir John Wyndham of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, and mother of Sir John Wyndham (1558‚Äì1645). The Wyndham family, which later commonly used the first name \\"Wadham\\", inherited the estate of Merryfield and the \\"Wyndham Estate\\" is still today the largest employer in the village of Ilton.

A junior branch of the Popham family was seated at Huntworth, Somerset, of which a prominent member was John Popham (c. 1531 ‚Äì 1607), Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord Chief Justice of England. Sir Stephen Popham died without male issue and his five daughters became his co-heiresses. The manor of Braydon, near Merryfield, went to his daughter Elizabeth Popham the wife of Sir John III Wadham. =Wadham= Sir John III Wadham Sir John III Wadham, eldest son and heir of William Wadham (d. 1452) of Edge, Branscombe in Devon, Sheriff of Devon in 1442, by his wife Margaret Chiselden, a daughter and co-heiress of John Chiselden of Holcombe Rogus in Devon. He married Elizabeth Popham, a daughter and co-heiress of Sir Stephen Popham (c. 1386 ‚Äì 1444). From this marriage the Wadhams inherited land in Braydon, near Merryfield, which they made their principal seat. It is believed by Rogers (1888) that the small but finely sculpted surviving alabaster effigy of a lady in Ilton Church represents Elizabeth Popham, heiress of Merryfield.

According to Collinson (1791): ::\\"When John Wyndham came to the estate, disliking the situation of the house, because it was surrounded with wood, he pulled it down, and with the materials built a farm-house at a little distance, now called Woodhouse, and likewise an alms-house in the village of Ilton. There now remains no part of the ancient edifice, except an old wall on the east side. The seat was formerly moted round, and the buildings exhibited many striking indications of remote antiquity\\". The Wyndham almshouses within the village of Ilton should not be confused with the almshouses built by Nicholas Wadham before his death: ‚ÄùIn the year 1606 he founded an almshouse for ‚Äòeight poor people‚Äô in the parish of Ilton, close to his house at Merifield, conveying to twelve trustees the building which he had lately erected for the purpose, together with a close ground adjoining thereto, and an annuity of ¬£42 chargeable on his estates in Merifield, Braydon and Ilton.

In his early years in partnership with William Y. Peters, he focused on large residences in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, primarily in the Georgian Revival style. As a partner in the firm of Parker, Thomas & Rice, he produced a number of landmark buildings and early skyscrapers in the Beaux-Arts style. Near the end of his career, his 1929 United Shoe Machinery Corporation Building in Boston was notable as one of the first skyscrapers in America to be built in the Art-Deco style that would become very popular in the following two decades. Early life and education Arthur W. Rice was born 18 July 1869 in Boston to George Woods Rice (14 July 1828 ‚Äì 14 November 1882) and Adelaide (Walker) Rice. The elder Rice was born in South Boston to David Rice and Hanna Thompson (Bangs) Rice. George Woods Rice was President of the Massachusetts Loan and Trust Company in Boston. Arthur Wallace Rice‚Äôs mother, Adelaide Walker, was born 21 October 1830 to Lemuel and Mary I. Walker in Boston, and she married G.W. Rice on 7 September 1853 in Roxbury. Adelaide (Walker) Rice died 27 August 1917 in Boston. Rice attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, earning a degree in architecture in 1891. In the next year, he studied architecture in Paris under the direction of famed architect Henri Duray at the prestigious √âcole des Beaux-Arts, returning to Boston in late 1892. Architectural career The United Shoe Machinery Company Building in Boston is one of Arthur Wallace Rice's later architectural works that pioneered the Art Deco style in AmericaRice began his career as a junior architect with architectural firms in Boston, and later became a partner with William Y. Peters to form the firm of Peters and Rice in 1898, with offices in the Pemburton Building on Pemburton Square in Boston. They specialized in large residences, particularly in the Back Bay of Boston, Brookline and in the suburbs.p. 254. In: Commercial and Financial New England. 1906. Edited & Published by the Boston Herald, Boston. Rice's early work included the Georgian Revival Phi Delta Theta House (1900) at 97 Bay State Road, and the old Weld Mansion (1900) at 149 Bay State Road, both in Boston Back Bay. Rice became the sole manager of the firm in 1903 when Peters retired from the practice, and Rice began work with Beaux-Art design. His first major Beaux-Art work was the remodel of the Walter Cabot Baylies House (1905) at 5 Commonwealth Ave. also in the Back Bay. Rice followed up the same year by his Beaux-Arts design of the Jones, McDuffee and Stratton Company Building (1905) in downtown Boston that later became incorporated into the Filene's Department Store building designed by Daniel Burnham.p. 5 In: The Filene's Complex Study Report as Amended May 9, 2006, Boston Landmarks Commission, Environment Department, City of Boston. web version He also became an Associate of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1905, and later at the December 1912 meeting of the AIA in Washington, DC, he was elected by his peers as an AIA Fellow.Withey, Henry F., and Elsie Rathburn Withey, 1956.

Harleston Parker of Boston, and they maintained offices in their home cities operating under the name of Parker & Thomas. In 1907, Rice became a partner in the firm and the name was changed to Parker, Thomas & Rice, with main offices at 20 Beacon Street in Boston. The firm had a varied and distinguished practice in both Boston and Baltimore designing banks, hotels, educational, governmental, and commercial buildings, as well as large residences and exposition buildings. The firm‚Äôs work is described as traditional in style, deriving its forms from the French and English Renaissance, as well as classic Italian and Greek forms, with the influence of the Beaux-Arts movement evident in their work. The firm was responsible for the design of a number of major buildings around the country including: The R. H.

The British Critic said that they really regretted this circumstance because the book gave, in language with which such persons were best acquainted, a just view of the principles which led to the French Revolution, to the elevation of Buonaparte to the throne of the Bourbons, and to all the miseries under which Continental Europe had so long groaned; contrasting those miseries with the happiness Britons enjoyed under the mild government of George III.Art.

Rogell, written by Lew Lipton and F. McGrew Willis, and starring William Boyd, Robert Armstrong, James Gleason, and Ginger Rogers. It was released on November 20, 1931, by RKO Pictures. Plot Three friends who work on the Coney Island Boardwalk, Skeets O'Reilly, Baltimore Clark, and Dutch Herman are all in love with the same woman, Sally. At the outbreak of World War I, the three men enlist in the US Navy. Before they leave for active duty, both Skeets and Baltimore meet with Sally, with the intention of letting her know how they feel about her. Baltimore can't bear the thought of Sally rejecting him, so he never discloses the depths of his feelings towards her. Skeets does propose to her, which she gently declines, being secretly in love with Baltimore. The three are assigned to a US Naval destroyer, Dutch and Skeets subordinate to Baltimore, who is promoted to a chief petty officer, because he has served in the navy before. A German U-boat intercepts a sailing ship flying Norwegian colors, and when the German officer boards the ship, the Norwegian captain shares information with him regarding the movements of allied shipping, thus showing us that the Norwegian ship is an undercover \\"message ship\\" for the Germans. Shortly after this encounter, the destroyer carrying the three friends also intercepts the sailing ship. In an attempt to destroy incriminating evidence, the Norwegian captain sets the ship afire. The three sailors are part of the boarding party, and Baltimore manages to take possession of coded dispatches prior to the ship's sinking. After the messages are decoded, it enables the US Navy to equip a fake \\"message ship\\", and O'Reilly, Clark and Herman are part of the crew assigned to man the vessel. The message ship cruises the Atlantic, hoping to be approached by a German submarine. Eventually they are, and during the encounter, they learn of the German plans to ambush and sink a fleet of American destroyers. As the Germans are about to leave, one of their officers becomes suspicious of the crew of the phony message ship. He exposes the American subterfuge, and the Germans return to their submarine and ready to sink the sailing ship. Before they can, Dutch manages to get a warning off to the American fleet. The US destroyers arrive, and the three German U-boats are sunk, two by American destroyers, and the third by the sailing ship. The three men return as heroes to the United States, and Baltimore marries Sally. Cast *Bill Boyd as Baltimore *Robert Armstrong as Dutch *James Gleason as Skeets *Ginger Rogers as Sally *Harry Bannister as Commander *Frank Reicher as Holtzmann *Ben Alexander as Kid *Henry Victor as Captain Von Schlettow *Hans Joby as Schwartz Production In early March 1931, RKO announced that Bill Boyd's first picture with the fledgling studio would be the submarine drama, Suicide Fleet. The original title of the film was Mystery Ship, referring to the clandestine nature of the ship communicating to the Germans. The following month, Lew Lipton was said to be working on the story, which was to be adapted to the screen by Marion Jackson, although Harold Shumate was also mentioned as the author of the story. By July both James Gleason and Robert Armstrong had been attached to the film, and it was published that Pierre Collings had been allocated to assist writing the screenplay. The film began production on July 27, 1931. The trade papers announced Sal Polito as the director of photography and Denzel A. Cutler as the sound editor. In August RKO announced the addition of Harry Bannister to the cast. Even though the film was already in production, the final pieces of the cast were announced in late August: Frank Reicher, Henry Victor, and Hans Joby. Several thousand extras were employed by RKO for the filming. Ginger Rogers, who had appeared in several smaller roles for Paramount Pictures, with whom she was under contract, was given her first starring role in this film. The film was partially shot at the San Pedro Naval Base, as well as on the studio's Culver City studio. In late August, the cast and crew spent several weeks at sea filming, 25‚Äì50 miles off the coast of San Diego, California, in cooperation with the United States Navy, before returning to the Culver City studio. During this time, an actual obsolete navy vessel was sunk during filming. During filming, Albert Rogell, through actual US Naval officers, had ten US Navy vessels under his command. Two sailing ships, the USS Indiana and the USS Bohemia were used extensively during the weeks the production was at sea, as were several tugs, submarines (including the USS Argonaut ‚Äì at the time the largest submarine in the world), and destroyers, including the USS Dent. Child actor, Ben Alexander, was announced as part of the cast of Suicide Fleet. RKO was reporting the completion of production of the film by mid-October. The film employed a new type of portable sound recording equipment, which employed the dual system of film and sound on separate recording reels. The unit was smaller, weighed less, and was more portable than other units of the era. RKO announced in early November that the film was scheduled for release Thanksgiving weekend.

It was established on 3 October 2002 by the Decree of the Government of Serbia. History An excellent basis for setting up the Faculty of Arts in Ni≈° as an independent degree-granting institution within the University of Ni≈° was the establishment of the Departments of Visual Arts and Music in 2000 within the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Ni≈°. The Faculty was founded as a higher educational and artistic institution offering programs in Visual Arts, Applied Arts, and Music. At the beginning of its existence and work, the Faculty was faced with major spatial and material problems. According to the above-mentioned founding decree, the Faculty was located in the building that was housing the College of Music. The first and originally the only body of the newly founded Faculty was a seven-member temporary council whose task was to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for setting up the regular Faculty bodies and set the foundation for the future operation and development of the Faculty. Until the establishment of the regular Faculty bodies, all the issues falling under the competences of the faculty council, educational-artistic-scientific council and election council - as regulated by the University Law in effect at that particular period - were dealt with by the Temporary Council. As regulated by the above-mentioned founding decree of the Serbian Government, Djuro Radonjiƒá, MA, associate professor of the Faculty of Philosophy in Ni≈°, was appointed Acting Dean of the Faculty, whereas Suzana Kostiƒá, MA was elected Vice Dean for academic affairs of the Faculty. In the same sequence of events the Faculty received a formal recognition of the Ministry of Education and sports regarding fulfillment of the personnel, spatial and technical requirements for the implementation of four-year undergraduate studies in the field of Music and five-year undergraduate studies in the areas of Applied and Visual Arts. Finally, on 22 October 2002, the Temporary Council adopted the Faculty Statute and Annual Work Program, and successfully finalized the process of recruitment and appointment of the teaching staff. In academic 2003‚Äì2004, the first generation of students at the Faculty of Arts in Ni≈° was admitted. The organs of the Faculty were constituted in December 2003, when the Temporary Council of the Faculty ceased to exist. At the first elections in 2004, Prof. dr Dragoslav Aƒáimoviƒá, MA was elected Faculty Dean, and after the first two-year mandate was reelected twice (1 October 2006 ‚Äì 30 September 2009, and 1 October 2009 ‚Äì 30 September 2012). Following the election procedures, in April 2012, Prof. dr Suzana Kostiƒá, was elected Dean of the Faculty for the period 1 October 2012 ‚Äì 30 September 2015. In compliance with the 2005 Law on Higher Education, the Faculty Council adopted its new Statute on 2 November 2006, and the Senate of the University of Ni≈° passed a resolution on approval of the study programs offered by the Faculty at the level of bachelor's and master's degrees. The Faculty received accreditation for all the study programs conducted at the bachelor's and master's level. So far, 707 students have graduated from the Faculty, and 57 students successfully completed their master studies.

Like customer satisfaction measurement, which it draws from, Constituent Voice treats measurement as an aspect of an intervention that not only provides metrics but contributes directly to outcomes by increasing the engagement of intended beneficiaries. History Based on four years of field research, from 2008 it was called Constituency Voice. The organization that led the field trials, Keystone Accountability, first published the first technical describing the method, then called Constituent Voice, in 2013. A revision of the original technical note was published in September 2014. Keystone sought and received a trademark for Constituent Voice in the United States in 2013. Constituent Voice‚Ñ¢ is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. Constituent Voice blends two important lines of thought in development. The main theoretical influence comes from Amartya Sen and Jean Dr√®ze, who locate individual human ‚Äòagency‚Äô at the heart of development. Sen‚Äôs great synthesis work, Development as Freedom, concludes that development cannot be reduced to material well-being. Development is best understood as a package of overlapping political and economic mechanisms that progressively enable the exercise of freedoms that allow people to meet their basic needs and in other ways set the courses of their lives. The other intellectual debt acknowledged by Constituent Voice literature is to the work of Albert O. Hirschman on the nature of choice under limited choice conditions. Hirschman observed that when faced with unsatisfactory performance from an organisation, people might decide not to exit but to ante up ‚Äì to engage to improve the organisation. Hirschman called this Voice. Constituent Voice metrics track Voice and Agency (among other things) and show how they can become essential assets for development service providers. A core claim of the Constituent Voice method is that its ‚Äúrelationship metrics‚Äù can be refined to accurately predict social outcomes, thereby providing real-time indicators that organisations can manage to in order to improve their performance and results. A growing number of US national and international organisations are promoting Constituent Voice. The world‚Äôs largest charity rating agency, Charity Navigator, incorporated Constituent Voice into its 2013 revision of its rating system, Results Reporting. Specifically citing Constituent Voice, the influential annual trends forecast by Lucy Bernholz, Philanthropy and Social Economy: Blueprint 2014, highlights ‚Äúconstituent feedback‚Äù as a key trend going forward. The global business management consulting firm, McKinsey and Company, cited Constituent Voice as number one of five ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù for foundations seeking to ‚Äúmake assessment work‚Äù. Overview of method Constituent Voice is akin to other recent innovations in measurement and project evaluation systems such as Outcome mapping, Utilisation-Focused Evaluation, and Most significant change technique in that it values measurement for its usefulness. It complements these and related approaches in its focus on measuring relationship quality ‚Äì especially relationships with the intended beneficiaries ‚Äì and using these metrics to drive change in organisational practice. When asked in 2011 to explain why he championed Constituent Voice, the President of Oxfam America Ray Offenheiser, said ‚ÄúAt its heart, Constituent Voice method promises to shift the very power to define ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô, and to declare when it has been achieved, into the hands of those that development organisations claim to serve. This shift toward greater agency is essential if we are to make development more effective.‚Äù Constituent Voice method has five steps, all of which must be completed. *Design :Designing feedback systems involves balancing four principles: (1) Rigour; (2) Sensitivity to Process and Culture; (3) Cost and (4) Utility. Oftentimes statistical rigour is elevated as a ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù in surveys, but Constituent Voice emphasises that failing to account for sensitivity, cost, and utility are equally important ingredients in the effectiveness of a feedback system. *Collect :For Constituent Voice, administering surveys is not simply about getting answers to questions; it‚Äôs about building a relationship with constituents so that they feel respected, consulted, and engaged in the process. As such, data collection begins by explaining the survey‚Äôs intended purpose so respondents understand the intentions, goals, and implications of their participation. :Constituent Voice uses a combination of continuous micro-surveys and periodic, high-quality, in-depth research. *Analyse :Constituent Voice uses descriptive statistics to develop clear and visually powerful data reports. :Typically Constituent Voice analysis segments respondents based on individual characteristics and survey response (like Net Promoter), to make it easier to use the analysis to develop corrective actions and strategies. In particular, you can identify course corrections that fit with different segments of an organisation‚Äôs constituents, including non- respondents. :Constituent Voice also looks for the predictive quality of its metrics by triangulating answers to surveys against other data sets providing measures of outcomes. For example, education studies have found that student feedback accurately predict patterns of learning gains associated with that teacher, including in other classrooms and in subsequent years. :Benchmarking is another important analytic tool used by Constituent Voice to better understand the results for any particular survey by comparing answers with the answers received to the same questions by another organisation. *Dialogue :Survey findings are inherently limited. Using survey findings to inform dialogues with respondents and others significantly extends their explanatory power. These dialogues allow validation of findings, deepen their interpretation, and agree possible solutions. Constituent Voice method emphasizes mutuality across constituents of a problem and the co-creation of solutions. *Course Correct :Constituent Voice advocates a short cycle iterative ‚Äútrial and error‚Äù approach to introducing change in organisational practices. It is important that organisations inform constituents of any corrective actions so that respondents to future surveys can provide informed views. Criticism of Constituent Voice A critical literature on Constituent Voice is yet to emerge. Since it consciously emphasizes utility, it is likely to attract the criticism that it is more concerned about performance management than accurate measurement. As such, it should not replace traditional metrics but complement them. Keystone Accountability co-founder David Bonbright has often been quoted as saying that ‚ÄúConstituent Voice is the most neglected important piece of the measurement puzzle. Not the only important piece, but the most neglected one.‚Äù See also * Evaluation * Impact evaluation * Logic model * Logical framework approach * Program evaluation * Social return on investment * Continual improvement process  References   External links  * Keystone Accountability Official Website * Keystone Accountability blog Category:Impact assessment Category:Project management techniques ","title":"Constituent Voice"},{"id":"43707418","text":"Dimosthenis Valavanis (Greek: ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøœÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ 1829‚Äì1854) was a Greek poet of the First Athenian School.

Their artwork falls within the fields of new technology, ice sculpture, installation art, video art, artists books and limited edition multiples.  Background  Nora Ligorano met Marshall Reese in 1977 while studying painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Reese moved to Baltimore in 1977 after a year abroad as a student at Pomona College. From 1978 to 1980, he co- published with Kirby Malone the small press magazine Epod that featured early language poetry and performance scores and began experimenting with visual and sound poetry as a member of CoAccident a collective of poets and musicians. Ligorano and Reese began working collaboratively in that context. In 1982 Ligorano was awarded a Fulbright scholarship in design arts in Spain. Reese moved with Ligorano to Barcelona, where they made their first video art piece, relocating to Madrid the following year. In 1984, Reese moved to New York City to pursue interests in video art. Ligorano joined him one year later in Williamsburg Brooklyn. In New York, both of them continued working in performance art and video expanding into other media including installations, artists books and limited edition multiples.  Works  = New Technology = In 2001, The Kitchen and MIT MediaLab commissioned LigoranoReese to make an interactive installation for the exhibition ID/entity. The artists‚Äô Van Eyck‚Äôs Mirror is an installation based on the Arnolfini Portrait using video, sensors and computer controls. This was among LigoranoReese‚Äôs first artworks that incorporated interactive technology. In 2003 they made In Memory of Truth an installation using a microprojection system designed by the artists and the optical engineer Tony Cappo. The centerpiece of the installation is a magnifying glass on a pedestal with a primary lens that miniaturizes Hollywood war films to fit on the head of a pin. Holland Cotter described the piece ‚Äúa tour-de-force.‚Äù History‚Äôs Garden 2006 was the next installation using a similar microprojection system. Mounting a prism and lens on a mechanical arm, they replaced the moving counterweight of a metronome with a small projection screen on which images of refugees from Central Europe and the Middle East are projected. With funding from NYSCA and the Jerome Foundation in 2003 they started research and development on illuminating woven fiber optic thread. From 2003 ‚Äì 2007 they worked with Eric Singer on developing the hardware. In 2009 while residents at Eyebeam, LigoranoReese met Luke Loeffler and devised programming with him for the fabric to respond to live information from the internet. Calling this body of work ‚Äúfiber optic data tapestries‚Äù the artists completed 50 Different Minds in 2010, which uses Twitter feeds and air flight data to make patterns and colors on its surface. In 2013 they debuted a new tapestry called I‚Ä¢AM‚Ä¢I at Miami Art Project with Catharine Clark Gallery. I‚Ä¢AM‚Ä¢I is a woven personal data portrait using Fitbit activity and responses to a self-reporting emotional survey to create an abstract portrait of the artists‚Äô subjects. Two of these pieces are in the collections of the University of Wyoming and 21C Museum in Louisville.

It is about threading narratives and > mythology, even language and accounting, with (the) quipu. Weaving is a > shared tradition common to cultures throughout the world in the same way > that computers and networks have flattened the world, making communication > and exchange more common.' = Ice Sculptures = In 2006, on the third anniversary of the Iraq War, the artists installed the word Democracy sculpted from 2000 pounds of ice in the garden of Jim Kempner Fine Art in New York City. They called it The State of Things and photographed and filmed it while it disappeared. This project began a series of public art events LigoranoReese call ‚Äútemporary monuments.‚Äù In 2008, Provisions Library invited the artists to participate in BrushFire, public art interventions by a number of artists during the campaign season in the Midwest. The artists reprised The State of Things at the conventions in Denver and St. Paul, installing ice sculptures of Democracy in front of the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver on the first day of the Democratic Convention and on the state capital grounds in St. Paul on the first day of the Republican Convention. In October that same year, the artists installed an ice sculpture of the word Economy on the 79th Anniversary of the Great Depression in front of the New York State Supreme Court Building at Foley Square. In 2010 LigoranoReese made an ice sculpture of the words Middle Class and filmed it disappearing in Kempner‚Äôs garden called Morning In America. Senator Bernie Sanders featured the time lapse video on his U.S. Senate webpage. In 2012 at the conventions in Tampa and Charlotte, the artists remade the installation in public parks there. The artists installed the ice sculpture Dawn of the Anthropocene in New York City in front of the Flatiron Building as part of the People's Climate March on September 21, 2014. It was a 21-foot long sculpture of the words \\"The Future\\" disappeared in 13 hours. = Installation Art = LigoranoReese began making video installations in 1992 often as sculptural objects that incorporate video monitors placed inside other media: newspapers, books and clocks. These sculptures concerned how electronic networks were changing physical media and transforming the act of reading and sharing information. Johanna Drucker commented on their installation The Corona Palimpsest: > The current tension of the book reflects the present tense of electronic > media continuing to come into being. This is not a contrast between the > space of the real and the space of the virtual, but between two modes of > imaginative life of thought, language, and the eye, each competing to > determine the relations of history, language and idea. As the page was once > written so the monitor redraws itself. In 1994 they installed their first public art installation in the windows of the Donnell Library Center. Acid Migration of Culture was a 48 ft x 8 ft photo mural of an open dictionary of cultural terms. Four video monitors displayed statements by artists, politicians and civic leaders on the role of arts in society. Free Speech Zone (2004) at the Brooklyn Public Library Grand Army Plaza Main Branch featured backlit duratrans photos of blind-folded library users and electronic zipper signs of titles and phrases of banned and challenged books. In 2005, they reinstalled it in the windows of the Donnell Library Center. = Video Art = Single channel video art and videos as elements of sculptures, installations and websites is an ongoing activity of their collaboration. They exhibit these in galleries and festivals. = Limited Edition Multiples = LigoranoReese began making artists books and limited edition multiples in 1992 with the Bible Belt as an element of a room- size installation with the same name. The edition consisted of a New Testament Bible mounted on a 33-inch belt with a gold-plated Jesus belt buckle. The Bible Belt became the first edition piece of the series the Pure Products of America. In 2001 the edition series became the website pureproductsusa. The Bible Belt was followed with Contract with America underwear in 1995, an edition of cotton underwear briefs with the name of the Republican congressional campaign silkscreened on the waistband, an image of the House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the crotch and the platform of the Contract on the seat. After the artists mailed pairs of the underwear to political leaders in Washington as gifts, they were sued by the Republican National Committee to cease and desist citing trademark infringement. In 2001 LigoranoReese published the W Collection on the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision halting the counting of ballots in Florida. The Collection consisted of a Bush vs Gore dish towel, Money/Honey, and the John Ashcroft snow globe. In 2004 the artists published the postcard book Line Up and sold it in Union Square during the Republican convention in NYC. Line Up depicted the Bush administration cabinet in the form of mug shots. Madness of Art editions published a limited edition set of digital prints acquired by the New York Public Library. LigoranoReese's limited edition art includes mirrors, lenticulars and snow globes.

The vessel was used primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic, but also took part in the Invasion of Normandy. After the war, the ship was converted to a headquarters vessel for amphibious operations, and saw service in the Persian Gulf from 1952 to 1965, before being scrapped in 1966. She was named for the River Meon in the United Kingdom. HMS Meon was sponsored by the town of Bletchley in Buckinghamshire. Meon was ordered on 24 January 1942. The ship was laid down on 31 December 1942 by A. & J. Inglis at Glasgow and launched 4 August 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 31 December 1943. War service After commissioning and trials, Meon sailed with convoy ON 220 to Canada. Once there she was recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 7 February 1944. After working up with her new Canadian crew, she joined convoy escort group 9 in May 1944. Following the ship's arrival in Londonderry Port to join the group, the vessel spent until October 1944 in the waters around the United Kingdom. It was during this period that Meon participated in Operation Neptune, the sea component of the invasion of Normandy and was present on D-day. Arriving at Halifax on 19 October 1944, Meon joined local convoy escort group 27 and was named Senior Officer's ship. She remained with the group until the end of March 1945, when the vessel returned to the United Kingdom and was handed back over to the Royal Navy at Southampton on 23 April 1945. Postwar service Following return from the Canadians, Meon was converted at Southampton into a combined operations headquarters ship for use in South-East Asia. The ship's 4-inch guns were removed, as were the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars, with armament reducing to three Bofors guns, allowing extra communications equipment and accommodation to be added. The conversion was completed in December 1945, and Meon was laid up in reserve at Harwich. After being used as an accommodation ship at Harwich, Meon, still in reserve, moved to Sheerness in 1949. Meon recommissioned in April 1951, and in July 1952 was transferred to the Persian Gulf to serve as HQ ship for the Amphibious Warfare Squadron (Gulf). In 1953, back in British waters for a refit, Meon took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden In 1956 Meon took part in the Suez Crisis, commanding landing craft during Operation Musketeer. In late June 1961, in response to Iraqi threats to annex Kuwait, Meon took part in Operation Vantage, helping landings of British troops and equipment in Kuwait. The vessel remained in the Gulf until 1965. The ship was laid up at Portsmouth until being sold to Hughes Bolckow Ltd and being broken up at Blyth, Northumberland from 14 May 1966.

A report by the United Nations said there had been an \\"alarming deterioration\\" in human rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily carried out by the forces of the Ukraine paramilitary forces. The UN also reported threats against, attacks on, and abductions of journalists and international observers, as well as the beatings and attacks on supporters of Ukrainian unity. A report by Human Rights Watch said \\"Anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people they suspect of supporting the Ukrainian government or consider undesirable...anti-Kiev insurgents are using beatings and kidnappings to send the message that anyone who doesn't support them had better shut up or leave\\". Non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International, have also raised concerns about the behaviour of some Ukrainian volunteer battalions. Amnesty International said that they often acted like \\"renegade gangs\\", and were implicated in torture, abductions, and summary executions. In a report from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission, Ivan ≈†imonoviƒá, UN Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights, wrote about illegal detention, abduction and intimidation of election officials in the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republics, and called for urgent action to prevent a Balkans-style war. He also warned of a humanitarian crisis due to a failure of social services in the region, and an exodus of people from affected areas. In October 2015, the DPR and LPR banned non-governmental organisations such as Doctors Without Borders and World Food Programme from the territory that they control. A report released on 3 March 2016 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that people that lived in separatist-controlled areas were experiencing \\"complete absence of rule of law, reports of arbitrary detention, torture and incommunicado detention, and no access to real redress mechanisms\\". In addition, the report noted \\"allegations of violations perpetrated with impunity by Ukrainian law enforcement officials‚Äîmainly elements of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)‚Äîincluding enforced disappearances, arbitrary and incommunicado detention, and torture and ill- treatment\\".Ukraine: growing despair among over three million civilians in conflict zone ‚Äì UN report, United Nations (3 March 2016) According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), \\"The results of a psychosocial assessment of children in Donetsk Oblast in Eastern Ukraine are deeply troubling ... and indicate that about half of all children aged 7-18 have been directly exposed to adverse or threatening events during the current crisis.\\" OSCE monitors spoke to refugees from Donetsk city in Zaporizhia. They said that men were \\"often not allowed\\" to leave the city, but were instead \\"forcibly enrolled in 'armed forces' of the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic' or obliged to dig trenches\\". By June 2015, the conflict had created 1.3 million internally displaced people (IDPs). According to the OHCHR, this number had grown to 1.6 million people by early March 2016. Casualties A report by the OHCHR released on 28 July 2014 said that based on \\"conservative estimates\\", at least 1,129 civilians had been killed since mid-April during the fighting, and that at least 3,442 had been wounded. Another OHCHR report, released on 20 November, estimated that the number of civilians killed in the conflict had risen to 4,317, and that at least 9,921 had been wounded. Amidst a large-scale escalation in fighting during January and February 2015, the number of casualties greatly increased. According to another OHCHR report based on Ukrainian government sources, 843 people were killed in Donbass from 13 January to 15 February. 359 of these were civilians. 3,410 people were injured during the same period, of which 916 were civilians. By 15 February 2015, 5,665 people had been killed since the start of the war in mid-April 2014, whilst 13,961 had been injured. According to the report, these numbers were \\"very conservative\\", and based only on \\"available data\\". The report went on to say that \\"the actual number of casualties is likely to be far higher since military and civilian casualties remain under-reported\\". On 19 February 2016 UNICEF stated that in 2015 more than 20 children were killed and over 40 were injured. Land mines laid during the conflict have also taken deadly civilian victims. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine has stated it had cleared the Donbasd of more than 44,000 mines by early December 2015. It is currently unclear how many unexploded devices remain.Three killed as passenger bus hits mine in east Ukraine, Yahoo! News (10 February 2015) According to UNICEF in 2015 28 children had been casualties due to mines and unexploded ordnance. According to a United Nations early March 2016 report over 3 million people lived in the War in Donbass conflict zone. 2.7 million of them lived in the areas controlled by separatist forces, while 200,000 people resided in the proximity to the contact line. Refugees Some refugees from the Donbass fled to parts of western and central Ukraine, such as Poltava Oblast. Around 2,000 families from the Donbass were reported to have taken refuge in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa. Other refugees from Luhansk fled to Russia during the week-long ceasefire that was declared 23 June 2014 and in effect until 27 June. As of June 2014, at least 110,000 people had left Ukraine for Russia in the wake of the conflict, according to a United Nations report. Refugees clustered around Rostov-on-Don, with 12,900 people, including 5,000 children, housed in public buildings and tent camps there. Similarly, the report stated that around 54,400 are internally displaced people (IDPs) within Ukraine itself. Between 15,000 and 20,000 refugees arrived in Svyatogorsk from Sloviansk after the Ukrainian Armed Forces intensified shelling on the city at the end of May. Remaining residents of the besieged city were without water, gas, and electricity. Despite this, most residents remained. Russian officials said that 70,000 refugees had fled across the border into Russia since the fighting began. Starting on 30 May, at least 1,589 refugees from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts were provided temporary accommodation in railway stations and railway hotels by Southern Railways. The largest number of refugees, 1,409 people, stayed at Kharkiv-Pasazhyrskiy railway station. Camps for internally displaced people were established in Kharkiv Oblast. OSCE monitors visited one camp at Havryshi, in Bohodukhiv Raion, after northern Donetsk Oblast had been retaken by government forces. Some of those displaced people had visited Sloviansk, and said that there was a lack of water, electrical power, food, and that banks were not operating. Some decided to continue to stay in the camp until conditions in Sloviansk improved, whereas others decided to return. By 16 July, thirty-six people had returned to Sloviansk. Another seventy people were meant to return on the day. Some sixty-five from other conflict areas also checked into the camp. According to railway operators, some 3,100 people used the Kharkiv‚ÄìSloviansk railway from 9‚Äì14 July. OSCE monitors also met with some refugees in Zaporizhzhia. The refugees said that many residents of Donetsk wanted to leave, but were unable to because they lacked the financial resources to do so. Trains leaving Donetsk were said to be filled to capacity, forcing many refugees to use private motorcars to escape. According to a United Nations OHCHR report, the number of internal refugees created by conflict reached 101,617 on 25 July, an increase of more than 15,000 since 15 July. The report also said that at least 130,000 had fled to Russia. OSCE monitors visited Sievierodonetsk on 29 July, after the city had been recaptured by governments forces. According to the OSCE, the situation had normalised, and the city had not been \\"severely damaged\\" during the conflict. The city's mayor said that 40% of the 120,000 residents had fled during war. By early August, at least 730,000 had fled fighting in the Donbass and left for Russia. This number, much larger than earlier estimates, was given by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Numbers of internal refugees rose to 117,000. By the start of September, after a sharp escalation over the course of August, the number of people displaced people from Donbass within Ukraine more than doubled to 260,000. The number of refugees that fled from Donbass to Russia rose to 814,000. The UNHCR expressed concerns over the displaced refugees as the winter sets in and was providing supplies to help them cope with the winter. Having been inundated with refugees from the Donbass, the Russian government established a resettlement programme that was meant to encourage refugees to settle in \\"far-flung\\" parts of Russia. This programme included guarantees of employment, accommodation, pensions, and a path to Russian citizenship. According to a 31 August report by the administration of Rostov Oblast, 42,718 Donbass refugees had been transported to cities across Russia for resettlement. As the shaky ceasefire implemented by the Minsk Protocol became increasingly untenable in early November, it was reported that the number of people that had fled insurgent- held areas of Donbass had reached one and a half million. About half of these fled to Russia, and the other half fled to peaceful parts of Ukraine. As such, the population of insurgent-held Donbass had decreased by a third from its pre-war level. Those forced to stay in the region were largely elderly, destitute, or otherwise unable to flee. Schools became greatly diminished, as roughly half of the pre-war population of school-age children had left Donbass. According to an OHCHR report, the number of refugees displaced from Donbass within Ukraine was 466,829 in mid November. Increased fighting during January and February 2015 led to a sharp increase in the number of people displaced from Donbass. According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the number of registered IDPs had reached 711,209 by 13 February 2015. Accommodation for IDPs in areas neighbouring the conflict zone had been exhausted by this point. Instead, refugees that arrived at reception points in cities like Sloviansk and Kharkiv were granted a free train ticket to areas in southern and western Ukraine. In June 2015, the UN identified that 75% of the IDPs had resettled amidst their communities in the provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk. According to a United Nations early March 2016 report 1.6 million people were registered internally displaced by the Ukrainian government. 800,000 to 1 million of them lived within Ukrainian government controlled Ukraine.Over 3 mln people live in conflict zone in Ukraine's east ‚Äì UN report, Interfax-Ukraine (3 March 2016) Abductions Since the start of the war, many people have been taken hostage or abducted by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. Apart from ordinary citizens taken as forced labour by the insurgents, these include journalists, city officials, local politicians, and members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). A particularly large number of hostages were taken by Vyacheslav Ponomarev in Sloviansk, though these were later freed when government forces recaptured the city. Ponomarev later complained in Russian media that while they were fighting in Slavyansk, other militia groups were busy with theft of humanitarian help and property of civilians in Donetsk. Insurgents in Donetsk raided the city's International Committee of the Red Cross office at 19:00 on 9 May, and captured large stocks of medical supplies. They detained between seven and nine Red Cross workers. Those taken prisoner were accused of espionage, and held in the occupied Donetsk RSA building. They were later released on 10 May. One of the prisoners was found to have been severely beaten. The OSCE mission in Ukraine lost contact with four of its monitors in Donetsk Oblast on 26 May, and another four in Luhansk Oblast on 29 May. Both groups were held for a month, until being freed on 27 and 28 June respectively. In early July, Amnesty International published evidence of beatings, torture, and abduction of activists, protesters and journalists by insurgents in the Donbass region since the start of the unrest in April. It said that \\"while most abductions appear to have a 'political' motivation there is clear evidence that abduction and torture is being used by armed groups to exert fear and control over local populations\\". The report also said that some people had been abducted for ransom. The report summarized its finding by stating that \\"the bulk of the abductions are being perpetrated by armed separatists, with the victims often subjected to stomach-turning beatings and torture. There is also evidence of a smaller number of abuses by pro-Kyiv forces.\\" A report by the United Nations OHCHR that was released on 28 July said that insurgent groups continued \\"to abduct, detain, torture and execute people kept as hostages in order to intimidate and to exercise their power over the population in raw and brutal ways\\". The report documents that at least 812 people have been abducted by the insurgents since mid-April, and said that these include \\"local politicians, public officials and employees of the local coal mining industry\\", and that \\"the majority are ordinary citizens, including teachers, journalists, members of the clergy and students\\". Shells hit residential building in Luhansk, 7 August 2014 In early August, Amnesty International voiced concerned about actions of Radical Party leader and member of the Verkhovna Rada Oleh Lyashko. Lyashko is the leader of a pro- government paramilitary that participated in the war in Donbass. According to the Amnesty International report, Lyashko conducted a \\"continuing campaign of violence, intimidation and abduction against individuals\\". As an example of this \\"campaign\\", the report cited the abduction of DPR defence minister Igor Kakidzyanov. The abduction was recorded by Lyashko's forces. In the video, Kakidzyanov was seen being abducted, and later, after having been captured, \\"dressed only in his underwear with two bleeding cuts to his body\\". In mid August, there were reports that members of the pro-government Aidar Battalion paramilitary had taken hostages and demanded ransom for their release. In one incident, a man from Polovynkyne in Luhansk Oblast was accused of \\"separatism\\" by members of the battalion, and taken hostage. The paramilitaries said that they would kill him unless his wife paid 10,000 US dollars in ransom. She did this, and the man was released. OSCE monitors said that \\"the man's head was heavily swollen, bloody, and bruised\\" and he had \\"bruises and smaller wounds on his arms and legs\\". Another man was taken captive by members of Aidar Battalion in Shchastya on 13 August. Also accused of \\"separatism\\", his current whereabouts are unknown. A statement released on 22 August by Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Antanas Linkeviƒçius said that the Lithuanian honorary consul in Luhansk, Mykola Zelenec, was abducted by pro-Russian insurgents and killed. Linkeviƒçius defined the abductors as 'terrorists'. A report released on the same day by Human Rights Watch criticised government forces for \\"the serial arrests of Russian journalists in Ukraine\\" and \\"the actions of extremists like parliamentarian Oleh Lyashko, who has repeatedly abducted and abused people accused of involvement with the insurgency\\". Another report released in late August by Human Rights Watch said that separatist forces were \\"arbitrarily detaining civilians and subjecting them to torture, degrading treatment, and forced labour\\", and that the insurgents \\"detained civilians for use as hostages\\". A report by the OHCHR that was released on 2 March 2015 said that Ukrainian law enforcement agencies had engaged in a \\"pattern of enforced disappearances, secret detention and ill-treatment\\" of people suspected of \\"separatism\\" and \\"terrorism\\". In addition, the report noted that DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that his forces detained up to five \\"Ukrainian subversives\\" each day. It was estimated that about 632 people were under illegal detention by separatist forces on 11 December 2014. On June 2, 2017 the freelance journalist Stanislav Aseyev was abducted. Firstly the de facto DNR government denied knowing his whereabouts but on July 16, an agent of the DNR's \\"Ministry of State Security\\" confirmed that Aseyev was in their custody and that he is suspected of \\"espionage\\". Independent media is not allowed to report from the \\"DNR\\"-controlled territory. Living conditions in the conflict zone Burning block of flats in Shakhtarsk, 3 August 2014 Monitors from the OSCE mission in Ukraine met with the self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Volodymyr Pavlenko, on 20 June. According to him, sewage systems in Sloviansk had collapsed, resulting in the release of least 10,000 litres of untreated sewage into the river Sukhyi Torets, a tributary of the Seversky Donets. He called this an \\"environmental catastrophe\\", and said that it had the potential to effect both Russia and Ukraine. The DPR imposed martial law on 16 July. OSCE monitors spoke to refugees from Luhansk city in early August. As government forces encircled the city, the refugees said that all electricity, water, and mobile connections were cut off. They said that the city was being shelled non-stop from 04:00 to 02:00 each day, with only a brief lull from 02:00 to 04:00. All shops were closed, and were few supplies remained in the city. Bread was nowhere to be found, and tap water was undrinkable. Anyone that could flee city had done so, and only those without money stayed. Corpses were buried in back gardens, as no undertakers were operating. Government forces shelled the DPR-occupied SBU building in the city of Donetsk on 7 August. In doing this, however, a public hospital and residential buildings fewer than from that building were hit by the shells. The entire second floor of the hospital was destroyed, and patients were traumatised. One civilian at the hospital died. A report by The New York Times said that insurgents fired mortars and Grad rockets from residential areas, and then quickly moved. This caused return fire by government forces to hit those areas, usually an hour later, after the insurgents had already left. OSCE monitors spoke with another group of refugees on 11 August, this time from Pervomaisk. According to the refugees, most people had fled Pervomaisk, with only 10,000 of the city's 80,000 inhabitants remaining. They said that the city was under heavy shelling by government forces from 22 July, that almost all blocks of flats had been damaged, and that only 30% of detached houses remained standing. They also said that at least 200 people had been killed. After having spoken to the refugees, OSCE monitors contacted the mayor of Pervomaisk, who confirmed the reports of the refugees. A report by The New York Times said that pro-Ukrainian unity residents in Donetsk city were intimidated by the insurgents. Another report by American radio network NPR said that some insurgents in Donetsk have used carjackings, forced labour, and abuse to intimidate those that oppose them, and that some local residents lived in fear of the insurgents. According to the United Nations in December 2014, some 300 instances of indiscriminate shelling of residential areas for which no party to the conflict had assumed responsibility had been recorded. Damaged building in Lysychansk, 4 August 2014 Living conditions in the combat zone deteriorated heavily amidst a new separatist offensive in January 2015. Rimma Fil, a worker with the Rinat Akhmetov Foundation, said that \\"the situation was bad before, but now it is a catastrophe\\". According to her, tens of thousands of people were suffering hunger. Medicines were largely unavailable. The worst affected were those that lived in the sprawling rural areas outside of major cities, who often lacked access coal for heating during the bitter winter. The situation was greatly exacerbated by the late 2014 move by the Ukrainian government to cut off all pension payments to people in the separatist-controlled areas, along with hospital, nursing home, prison, and orphanage funding. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs early 2016 69% of households in separatist controlled areas had difficulty accessing food markets due to rising prices and poverty.Hard lines: Access issues deepen Ukraine aid crisis, IRIN (4 March 2016) The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) stated in an April 2016 report that almost 300,000 people in the combat zone were severely food insecure and in need of immediate food assistance. The report said the residents living in the separatist controlled area of Luhansk Oblast and near the conflict line were the most affected by food insecurity. According to the WFP over half of the population, in both the government-controlled area and non-government controlled area, experienced a complete loss or a significant reduction of income.Conflict In Eastern Ukraine Leaves 1.5 Million People Hungry, United Nations World Food Programme (04 April 2016) About 1.5 million people face threat of hunger in Ukraine's Donbas region ‚Äì UN, Ukraine Today (05 April 2016) Separatist authorities have banned most international medical organizations and have taken a hard line on drug addiction, making methadone and substitution therapy illegal. As a result, people living with HIV/AIDS (reportedly three times higher Donbass than in the rest of Ukraine) have fled separatist-controlled areas. A July 2016, a published analysis of changes in nighttime light intensity by Tom Coupe (Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine), Micha≈Ç Myck and Mateusz Najsztub (CENEA, Poland) found that the economic activity in the Donbass had dropped 30 to 50% of the pre-war level for the big cities and to only a tenth of the pre-war level for some smaller cities. It also concluded that the local economy was not showing any signs of improving despite the decrease in military activity since the Minsk I and II agreements in 2015. The Eastern Human Rights Group (EHRG) released a rapport that stated that 5,000 people in Luhansk People's Republic were held in solitary confinement, beaten, starved or tortured if they refuse to carry out unpaid work. (They claimed to have evidence that the situation was similar in Donetsk People's Republic.) According to the EHRG \\"All this takes place for the purpose of enriching a certain group of people in the so-called LPR.\\" Inmates conditions had deteriorated in separatist controlled detention centres and relatives paid LPR authorities to ensure the safety of inmates.'Slave labour' in the prisons of eastern Ukraine, BBC News (3 October 2016) Late September/early October 2016 water stations located in the government-controlled area of Luhansk Oblast stopped functioning as a result of unpaid electricity bills.ICRC to repay Ukraine utilities debts for occupied Luhansk, UNIAN (6 October 2016) After the International Committee of the Red Cross paid $700,000 to cover debts for power and water supplies in the separatist controlled territories of Luhansk Oblast they resumpted working. Hopes for a resolution to the crisis in Donbass in early 2020 were dashed by the coronavirus pandemic. According to Nataliia Kyrkach, leader of the Slavic Heart humanitarian organisation, as cited in The New Humanitarian, the pandemic caused the situation in Donbass to go backward \\"100%\\" to the \\"dark days\\" of 2014‚Äì2015. Particularly, quarantine measures imposed by Ukraine, the DPR, and the LPR prevents those in the occupied territories from crossing the line of contact, negating access to critical resources. Before the pandemic, residents of the DPR and LPR frequently crossed the border into Ukrainian- controlled territory to shop, withdraw money from their Ukrainian bank accounts and collect their state pensions, and a local industry serving these people emerged in towns like Volnovakha; as an example, there were 1.5 million crossings of the line of contact in August 2019. Fighting increased in March, with nineteen civilians killed, more than in the previous five months combined. While some crossings opened to small numbers of people in June 2020, the DPR introduced new regulations, ostensibly to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which made it nigh impossible for most people to cross the line of contact. In contrast, the Russian border completely reopened. War crimes According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the arbiter of international humanitarian law, the conflict is a \\"war\\", meaning that war crimes investigations can be held. A press release from the organisation said \\"These rules and principles [international humanitarian law] apply to all parties to the non-international armed conflict in Ukraine, and impose restrictions on the means and methods of warfare that they may use\\". Human Rights Watch said that Ukrainian government forces, pro-government paramilitaries, and the insurgents had used unguided Grad rockets in attacks on civilian areas, stating that \\"The use of indiscriminate rockets in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and may amount to war crimes\\". It also stated that pro-Russian insurgents \\"failed to take all feasible precautions to avoid deploying in civilian areas\\" and in one case \\"actually moved closer to populated areas as a response to government shelling\\". Human Rights Watch documented Grad rocket use in civilian areas in the fighting at Donetsk railway station on 21 July, in Kuibyshivskyi district of Donetsk city on 19 July, and in Petrovskyi district of Donetsk city and Marynivka on 12 July. It called on all sides to stop using the \\"notoriously imprecise\\" Grad rockets. Destroyed house in Donbass, 22 July 2014 Another report by Human Rights Watch said that the insurgents had been \\"running amok...taking, beating and torturing hostages, as well as wantonly threatening and beating people who are pro-Kiev\\". It also said that the insurgents had destroyed medical equipment, threatened medical staff, and occupied hospitals. A member of Human Rights Watch witnessed the exhumation of a \\"mass grave\\" in Sloviansk that was uncovered after insurgents retreated from the city. DPR prime minister Aleksandr Zakharchenko said on 24 August that the Ukrainian government had used white phosphorus against the insurgents.See 17:12 in this video Similar allegations had previously been reported in the Russian media from June onward. A 20 June report by Human Rights Watch analysed many of the videos, and determined that the substance shown in the videos was not white phosphorus. They also said that some of the videos cited by the Russian media were actually from a 2004 white phosphorus attack by American forces in Iraq. Insurgents with bayonet-equipped automatic rifles in the city of Donetsk paraded captured Ukrainian soldiers through the streets on 24 August, the Independence Day of Ukraine. During the parade, Russian nationalistic songs were played from loudspeakers, and members of the crowd jeered at the prisoners with epithets like \\"fascist\\". Street cleaning machines followed the protesters, \\"cleansing\\" the ground they were paraded on. Human Rights Watch said that this was in clear violation of the common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The article forbids \\"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment\\". They further said that the parade \\"may be considered a war crime\\". In response, DPR Prime Minister Aleksandr Zakharchenko stated: \\"We did nothing against international law. The prisoners were not undressed or starved. Show me a single international law which prohibits parading prisoners.\\" See 8:10 in this video (press conference, 24 August 2014) In a press-conference on 25 August, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he \\"did not see anything close to abuse\\" at the parade. On the following day, the insurgents tied a woman accused of being a spy to a lamppost. They wrapped her in a Ukrainian flag, and had passers-by spit her, slap her, and throw tomatoes at her. She was later identified as Iryna Dovhan. Amnesty International released a report that documented war crimes committed by pro-government paramilitary territorial defence battalions on 8 September. The report focused on the Aidar Battalion, which operates in the northern part of Luhansk Oblast. Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty, met with Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on the same day, and urged him and his government to bring the territorial defence battalions \\"under effective lines of command and control, to promptly investigate all allegations of abuses and to hold those responsible to account\\". She said that the Ukrainian government should not \\"replicate the lawlessness and abuses that have prevailed in areas previously held by separatists\\", and that \\"the failure to stop abuses and possible war crimes by volunteer battalions risks significantly aggravating tensions in the east of the country and undermining the proclaimed intentions of the new Ukrainian authorities to strengthen and uphold the rule of law more broadly\\". In late September, DPR forces found several unmarked graves in a coal mine near the village of Nyzhnia Krynka. They said that the graves contained the bodies of both DPR insurgents and civilians. OSCE monitors who went to the grave site said that they saw two dirt mounds, each containing two bodies. On the side of a road in the village, OSCE monitors reported that they saw a mound of dirt that \\"resembled a grave\\", had \\"a stick with a plaque\\" that said \\"died for Putin's lies\\", and which also listed the names of five people. A map of human rights violations committed by the separatists, called the \\"Map of Death\\", was published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in October 2014. The reported violations included detention camps and mass graves. Subsequently, on 15 October, the SBU opened a case on \\"crimes against humanity\\" perpetrated by insurgent forces. A mid- October report by Amnesty International documented cases of summary executions by both pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces. It also said that many abuses were deliberately misreported as \\"accidents\\". The report said that an Amnesty International team found no traces of \\"mass graves\\", but said that they had documented isolated incidents that could constitute war crimes. It also noted that accusations of abuses were being \\"inflated\\" as part of a \\"propaganda war\\" waged by both sides, but particularly by Russia. A concurrent report by Human Rights Watch documented widespread use of cluster munitions across the Donbass by Ukrainian government forces in early October, adding that anti-government forces might also have been using the munitions. Ukraine did not sign the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, which banned their usage. Ukrainian forces denied using any cluster munitions, and an OSCE spokesman said that they had found no trace of cluster munitions use in the combat zone. A German foreign ministry spokesman said that the German government had requested an independent inquiry into the matter. On 3 February 2015, the OSCE confirmed that Luhansk had been shelled by 9M55K model Smerch rockets (calibre 300mm) with cluster munitons. In October 2014, Aleksey Mozgovoy organised a \\"people's court\\" in Alchevsk that issued a death sentence by a show of hands to a man accused of rape. Mozgovoy also answered questions from the audience, explaining that he ordered his patrols to \\"arrest any woman found sitting in a caf√©\\" because women \\"should care about their spirituality\\". This statement caused significant critical response in the Russian media. At a press conference in Kyiv on 15 December, UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights Ivan ≈†imonoviƒá stated that the majority of human rights violations committed during the conflict were carried out by the separatists. He also said, however, that this could not be used as an excuse by Ukrainian forces to commit human rights violations. Amnesty International reported that it had found \\"new evidence\\" of summary killings of Ukrainian soldiers on 9 April 2015. Having reviewed video footage, it determined that at least four Ukrainian soldiers had been shot dead \\"execution style\\". AI deputy director for Europe and Central Asia Denis Krivosheev said that \\"the new evidence of these summary killings confirms what we have suspected for a long time\\". AI also said that a recording released by Kyiv Post of a man, allegedly separatist leader Arseny Pavlov, claiming to have killed fifteen Ukrainian prisoners of war was a \\"chilling confession\\", and that it highlighted \\"the urgent need for an independent investigation into this and all other allegations of abuses\\". In December 2015 a team led by Ma≈Çgorzata Gosiewska published another large report on war crimes in Donbass. For example, indiscriminate shelling and the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces near water facilities in Donetsk region have a negative impact on the supply of water for civilian population on both sides of the contact line. In villages Dolomitne, Nevelske, Novooleksandrivka, Opytne, Pisky, Roty, and Vidrodzhenniato the Ukrainian troops block access of local population to medical care. In addition to this some units of Ukrainian Armed Forces are reportedly involved in numerous cases of looting of private houses. Dutch journalist Chris Caspar de Ploeg in his book \\"Ukraine in the Crossfire\\" emphasizes that in many cases a military activity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces constitutes war crimes. Based on information provided by OSCE, UN, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch he demonstrates that the Ukrainian Army is using heavy military equipment for shelling of residential areas including educational and medical facilities. In addition to this The New York Times, Human Rights Watch, and the OSCE independently documented the use of cluster munitions by the regular Ukrainian army. This kind of weapon was banned by 118 countries due to its inability to discriminate between civilian and military targets. UN observers also registered multiple episodes of sexual abuse against locals, mainly women, at the border checkpoints run by the Ukrainian forces. The presence of the Ukrainian troops in civil communities also brings up a danger of sexual violence against their population and increase the risk of rape and human trafficking. During 2014 and 2015 the UN Monitoring Mission documented multiple reports about people abducted by the Ukrainian military forces and some of them were never seen again. Infrastructure damage A report by the United Nations OHCHR found that at least 750 million US dollars worth of damage had been done to property and infrastructure in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by July. Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said on 31 July that at least 2 billion hryvnia would be allocated to rebuild the Donbass. Donetsk mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko told the OSCE on 4 September that large parts of Donetsk city had been \\"heavily damaged\\". He said that \\"enormous funds\\" would be needed to repair the damage, and that at least 35 schools had been completely destroyed by shelling. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 22 December that 20% of the Ukraine's industrial output had come from territories now controlled by the DPR and LPR. He also said that roughly half of the industrial infrastructure in separatist-controlled areas had been destroyed during the war. Hundreds of schools have been destroyed in the conflict zone. Human Rights Watch has accused separatists and the Ukrainian military of using schools for military purposes.RFE/RL: Hundreds of schools destroyed in Ukraine war, military use must stop - HRW, Ukraine Today (11 February 2016) HRW: Hundreds Of Schools Destroyed In Ukraine War, Military Use Must Stop, Radio Free Europe (11 February 2016) According to a Human Rights Watch study schools that were not destroyed have been forced to operate in dangerous and often overcrowded conditions, while many children have been forced to stop attending school altogether. On 19 February 2016, UNICEF stated that, in the conflict zone, \\"at least one out of five schools has been damaged or destroyed\\".wo years on, Ukraine conflict affects over half a million children - UNICEF, UNICEF (19 February 2016) Ecological situation Since the start of the War in Donbass, according to the OSCE, 36 mines in separatists controlled territory have been destroyed and flooded.Disaster in the making, The Ukrainian Week (16 April 2018) This has led to a deterioration of the ecological situation there. In April 2018 80 sources of drinking water in the territory were unfit for use. Studies published by Russian media in 2017 indicated an eightfold increase in the level of salt in the water of the region. The concentration of pollutants in soils, in particular mercury, vanadium, cadmium and strontium, sometimes exceeds norms by 17 times in areas that have seen combat. Humanitarian response An emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the subject of the humanitarian situation in Donbass was held on 5 August at Russia's behest. Russia proposed that a \\"humanitarian mission\\" be sent to Ukraine to help alleviate the suffering of civilians in the region. Western governments responded hesitantly to the proposal, with British permanent representative to the United Nations Sir Mark Lyall Grant saying \\"It is deeply ironic that Russia should call for an emergency meeting of the council to discuss a humanitarian crisis largely of its own creation\\". The government of Russia stated that it would send a humanitarian convoy to Luhansk city on 11 August, which was completely cut off from electrical power, water, food, and gas supplies amidst a government offensive on insurgents in the city. According to government spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the convoy would be dispatched under the \\"aegis of the Red Cross\\". Western governments were weary of the plan, which NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said was part of \\"developing the narrative and the pretext\\" for an invasion of Ukraine \\"under the guise of a humanitarian operation\\". The government of Ukraine said that the convoy would not be allowed to cross the border into Ukraine. Despite this, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that an agreement between Ukrainian and Russian government officials had been made, which would allow the convoy to drive to the border. At the border, the goods carried would be unloaded and put onto Ukrainian lorries. The convoy left Moscow on 12 August, despite any evidence of a concrete agreement as to where the convoy would go or what it would carry. It consisted of 280 army lorries, painted white, and was said to carry of goods, \\"including grain, sugar, medicine, sleeping bags and power generators\\". A spokesman for the ICRC said that the Russian government had not provided \\"basic details\\" about the contents or route of the lorries. There were suggestions that the convoy was a trojan horse (or \\"Trojan centipede\\") operation, to \\"smuggle weapons to rebel militias rapidly running low on fuel and ammunition\\" Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, said that there were \\"three conditions\\" that had to be met by the Russian convoy: it should cross the border at a post controlled by the State Border Guard, it should be accompanied by ICRC workers, and it should clearly state its destination, its route, and what it carried. The Russian government said that its destination was Shebekino- Pletenivka border crossing, in Kharkiv Oblast. The convoy stopped in central Russia, about from that border crossing, as Ukrainian Internal Affairs minister Arsen Avakov said \\"no humanitarian convoy of Putin's will be allowed to cross the territory\\". After some time, the convoy continued to Rostov Oblast. It headed toward insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing, rather than the government-controlled Shebekino-Pletenivka in Kharkiv Oblast that had been agreed. It stopped in a field at Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, from Izvaryne. Inspectors from the State Border Guard of Ukraine were sent to the field on 15 August to examine the contents of the convoy. The convoy drove to the insurgent-held Izvaryne border crossing on 17 August, after having been declared \\"legal\\" by the Ukrainian government. Despite this, the State Border Guard said that they had received no paperwork from the convoy, and the Red Cross had not yet given the convoy clearance to cross into Ukraine, citing \\"security issues\\". In a press briefing on 19 August, a spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that an advance team of Red Cross workers was sent to the Izvaryne border crossing to assess the convoy, and to organise transport of its cargo to Luhansk. He also said that work on processing the convoy had been delayed because the DPR and LPR had not guaranteed the safety of the Red Cross workers that are meant to drive the convoy to its destination. The Red Cross gave the convoy instructions on how to deliver the goods to Luhansk on 21 August. The instructions dictated that the lorries should drive directly to the delivery point, and must be escorted by the ICRC at all times. Despite these instructions, the convoy entered Ukraine without customs clearance or an ICRC escort on 22 August. SBU chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said that this was tantamount to a \\"direct invasion\\", and the Red Cross said that it was not part of the moving convoy \\"in any way\\". The convoy was escorted into Ukraine by pro-Russian forces affiliated with New Russia. After delivering its cargo somewhere in Luhansk Oblast, the convoy crossed back into Russia at Izvaryne on 23 August. A series of humanitarian convoys was sent by the Ukrainian government to Luhansk Oblast in August. The first convoys, from the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk, arrived at Starobilsk and Sievierodonetsk on 8 and 10 August respectively. A total of sixty lorry-loads of aid were sent. Workers with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine continued to operate in areas controlled by the pro-Russian forces, unimpeded by the LPR. They worked with the local Red Cross to distribute aid. Another group of convoys was sent by the Ukrainian government on 14 August. Seventy-five lorries bound for Luhansk and carrying of aid left from the same cities as the first group of convoys. According to the government, the aid was transferred to the Red Cross for distribution upon arrival into the combat zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia hoped to send a second \\"humanitarian convoy\\" to the Donbass conflict zone on 25 August. He stated \\"The fact that the first convoy eventually delivered aid with no excess or incidents gives us reason to hope that the second one will go much more smoothly\\". This convoy crossed into Ukraine at Izvaryne on 13 September. OSCE monitors said that it consisted of 220 lorries. A third Russian aid convoy bound for Luhansk entered Ukraine at Izvaryne on 31 October. It consisted of about forty vehicles, all of which were inspected by both Russian and Ukrainian border guardsmen. Amnesty International reported on 24 December 2014 that pro-government volunteer territorial defence battalions were blocking Ukrainian aid convoys from entering separatist-controlled territory. These battalions, such as the Dnipro, Aidar, Donbas and Right Sector, have stopped most convoys from passing through, including those sent by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. According to the report, the battalions believe that the aid will be sold by the separatists, rather than provided to residents of the Donbass. Furthermore, battalion members insisted that separatist forces needed to release prisoners of war if aid was to be allowed through. As a result of the war, more than half of those residents remaining in the Donbass rely entirely on humanitarian aid. Director of Europe and Central Asia for Amnesty International Denis Krivosheev said that \\"Checking the content of humanitarian convoys crossing frontline is one thing. Preventing it is another. Attempting to create unbearable conditions of life is a whole new ballgame. Using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime\\". In addition, the report said that the volunteer battalions often act like \\"renegade gangs\\", and called on the Ukrainian government to bring them under control. Stakhanov- based Cossack separatist commander Pavel Dryomov said that the Luhansk People's Republic leadership was stealing aid carried by the Russian convoys, in an apparent confirmation of earlier reports by Ukrainian forces: \\"Out of ten [Russian] humanitarian convoys, only one has reached the people. Everything else has been stolen\\".  Allegations of anti-semitism  On Passover eve, alleged members of the Donetsk Republic, carrying the flag of the Russian Federation, passed out a leaflet to Jews that informed all Jews over the age of 16 that they would have to report to the Commissioner for Nationalities in the Donetsk Regional Administration building and register their property and religion. It also claimed that Jews would be charged a $50 'registration fee'. If they did not comply, they would have their citizenship revoked, face 'forceful expulsion' and see their assets confiscated. The leaflet stated the purpose of registration was because \\"Jewish community of Ukraine supported Bendera Junta,\\" and \\"oppose the pro-Slavic People's Republic of Donetsk.\\" The incident was reported by Jewish community members, and security at the synagogue confirmed that the men returned again on 16 April to further press their point. The authenticity of the leaflet could not be independently verified. In the New York Times, Brendan Nyhan described the fliers as \\"most likely a hoax\\" and referred to the media coverage of an \\"apparently bogus story\\". According to Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the leaflets looked like some sort of provocation, and an attempt to paint the pro-Russian forces as anti-semitic. The chief rabbi of Donetsk stated that the flyer was a fake meant to discredit the self-proclaimed republic, and saying that anti-Semitic incidents in eastern Ukraine are \\"rare, unlike in Kiev and western Ukraine\\". France 24 also reported on the questionable authenticity of the leaflets. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz noted in its headline that the flier was \\"now widely seen as fake\\". In The New Republic, Julia Ioffe also believes it to be a politically motivated hoax, although the perpetrators remain unknown. Donetsk People's Republic chairman Denis Pushilin initially confirmed that the flyers were distributed by his organization, but denied any connection to the leaflet's content. Pushilin later denied at a press conference that the DPR had anything to do with the flyer, calling it provocation and a \\"complete lie\\". The barricade outside the Donetsk RSA. According to Donetsk city chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski, the press secretary of the self-proclaimed republic, Aleksander Kriakov, is \\"the most famous anti-Semite in the region,\\" and believes the men were 'trying to use the Jewish community in Donetsk as an instrument in the conflict.' According to Michael Salberg, director of the international affairs at the New York City-based Anti-Defamation League, it is currently unclear if the leaflets were issued by the pro-Russian leadership or a splinter group operating within the pro-Russian camp or someone else. National Post reported: \\"Jewish leaders in the city have said they see the incident as a provocation, rather than a real threat to their community of about 17,000 people.\\" Ukraine's Security Service announced it had launched an investigation on the matter. On 17 April, pro-Russian separatists aided by Russian military specialists seized a TV tower providing signals to cities in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian channels were removed from air, with Russian channels given the frequencies. On 20 April, which the Euro-Asian Congress noted was Adolf Hitler's birthday, activists boasted about their imminent \\"victory\\" in anti- Semitic terms. \\"Here, from Sloviansk, we are inflicting a powerful information conceptual blow to the biblical matrix... to Zionist zombie broadcasting.\\" They then presented a lecture by former Russian Conceptual Party Unity leader Konstantin Petrov, who the EAJC described as a \\"anti-Semitic neo-pagan national-Stalinist sect\\". Boruch Gorin, a senior figure in the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, told The Jerusalem Post that rebel leaders \\"have allowed themselves to employ fully anti-Semitic rhetoric on previous occasions.\\" According to Vyacheslav A. Likhachev, researcher with the Euro- Asian Jewish Congress, anti-Semitic statements are part of the \\"official ideology\\" of the \\"people's republics.\\"  Attacks on Romani people  The News of Donbass reported that members of the Donbass People's Militia engaged in assaults and robbery on the Romani (also known as Roma or gypsies) population of Sloviansk. The armed separatists beat women and children, looted homes, and carried off the stolen goods in trucks, according to eyewitnesses. \\"They drove up in several cars and they had automatic weapons and pistols. They began shooting at the windows and they shot the locks off the doors, burst inside and started beating everyone - children, the elderly, men and women,\\" Natalia Vorokuta, a member of a Romani women's cultural outreach group, told Romea.cz while describing events in Sloviansk. \\"They had to stand with their faces to the wall while the men threatened them and yelled that they had to immediately give them everything they have: Arms, drugs, gold and money. They threw everything they looted and stole into the vans and drove off,\\" Vorokuta said, adding that the pogrom had an 'obviously racial subtext'. On 23 April, more attacks on Romani were reported in Sloviansk, including a man shot in the leg. The militants claimed they were acting on orders from 'People's Mayor' and militant leader Vyacheslav Ponomaryov. Reports of the attacks were confirmed by Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, as well as a heightened level of xenophobic rhetoric at separatist rallies. Ponomarev confirmed the attacks and said that they were only against Romani he alleged were involved in drug trafficking, and that he was 'cleaning the city from drugs.' The European Roma Rights Center reported that on 29 April in Slovyansk, a Romani man was shot while trying to defend his home and remains in a serious condition. In Sloviansk, Romani have since fled en masse to live with relatives in other parts of the country, fearing ethnic cleansing, displacement and murder. Some men who have decided to remain are forming militia groups to protect their families and homes. On 9 May, the US mission to the OSCE condemned credible reports of pro- Russian groups establishing \\"a disturbing and ongoing pattern of anti-Roma violence.\\" The organization called on Russia \\"to use its influence with pro- Russia separatist groups to cease their destabilizing activity that could be perceived as enabling violence and intimidation targeted at Roma.\\" Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk said that his government would not tolerate incitement of ethnic hatred and would take all legal measures to prevent the import into Ukraine of anti-Semitism and xenophobia. He instructed law enforcement agencies to identify those distributing hateful material and bring them to justice, as well as those involved in the attacks on Romani.

It is one of six works of public art in Sutton town centre. Design and location The mural was created in 1993 by two Public artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner on the 25th anniversary of Sutton's twinning in 1968 with Wilmersdorf in Berlin. Seven individual paintings make up the mural. It is positioned along the north flank of a Victorian commercial building at the southern end of the High Street near the train station at the junction with Sutton Court Road. The paintings are on plywood and inset within seven mock window frames. The paintings depict scenes of the London Borough of Sutton and its four European twin towns: Gagny, a suburb of Paris in France; Gladsaxe, a suburb of Copenhagen in Denmark; Minden in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany; and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf in Berlin in Germany. (There is also a \\"friendship link\\" with Tavernelle, which is 16 miles south of Florence in Italy.)London Borough of Sutton Town Twinning page The twin towns mural was commended by the Sutton and Cheam Society in 1994.Mosaic Makers website Drostle and Turner also produced the Sutton heritage mosaic. Mural features The five main paintings show a number of the main features of their respective areas, along with the heraldic shield of each above the other images. Each painting also features a plant as a visual representation of its subject's environmental awareness. In the case of Sutton this is in a separate smaller painting (above its main one) showing a beech tree, intended as a symbol of prosperity and from which Carshalton Beeches in the borough derives its name. The artists involved pupils from Sutton schools and community groups in the early designs; each group dealt with a different town. Sutton's mural painting shows a range of its most well known landmarks, including Whitehall in Cheam, Carshalton Ponds, Honeywood House and the spire of Trinity Church in Sutton town centre. Gagny's shows the H√¥tel De Ville, an ancient manor surrounded by a garden. The mural for Gladsaxe shows Bagsv√¶rd Lake, Bagsv√¶rd Church and H√∏jg√¢rd.

It is Grade II* listed. History The hall has its origins in a medieval courthouse, used by the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater, which was in the ownership of the Radclyffe family by the 16th century. Richard Dudley, of Yanwath, acting as the local overseer on behalf of the \\"Company of Mines Royal\\", took a lease on the building from Lady Catherine Radclyffe of Derwentwater, the wife of Sir George Radclyffe of Derwentwater (1717-1579), in 1570. Dudley converted it into a storehouse for \\"weighing and keeping copper\\". He wrote to the Secretary of State, Sir William Cecil, in October 1570 to report that the works were ongoing and it appears that those works, which involved \\"pulling down of the old house\\", were completed the following year. The upper floor continued to be used as the manorial courtroom while the ground floor was used to store the copper from the mines; once demand for copper reduced, the ground floor was used as a market hall. After the building fell into a dilapidated condition, it was thought to have been rebuilt with stones from the remains of the Radclyffe mansion on Lord's Island in 1695.Otley, p. 64 The freehold ownership of the building passed to the James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater on the death of his father in 1705; however after James Radclyffe was executed for his involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1715, his property was seized and passed to the trustees of Greenwich Hospital. The current structure, built of lime-washed stone and slate walling, was commissioned by the trustees of Greenwich Hospital in 1813. It was designed with a square tower on the north end with a round-arched doorway and a double flight of steps inside and with what the Keswick Tourist Information Board describes as an \\"unusual one-handed clock\\" at the top. The Marshall family acquired the building from the trustees of Greenwich Hospital in 1832. It became home to the Keswick Museum of Local and Natural History, a creation of the Keswick Literary and Scientific Society, in 1873. The museum collection included a three-dimensional model of the Lake District, measuring 12 feet by 9 feet, made by Joseph and James Flintoft in 1837. The building was used for civic assembliesDalton, p.624 and meetings of the Keswick Urban District Council after it was formed in 1894: the local council acquired the building from the Marshall family in 1896, and the museum moved out to purpose-built facilities in Station Road in 1897. However, it ceased to be the local seat of government when the Allerdale Borough Council was formed in 1974. In the late-1970s a Tourist Information Centre was established on the ground floor, while an art gallery was created on the floor above.

Early life Hossein Nuri was born in 1954 in Iran. He lost his father at the age of three and her mother raised him. He showed interest in painting at elementary school. After finishing elementary school in Mashhad, he gained a scholarship to continue studies at Farah Industrial School in Tehran. Torture and Disability Farah Industrial School was deeply monitored by SAVAK, Iran's pre-revolution secret service. Along the nation's dissatisfaction with Shah's policies, Nuri wrote a play which was a political satire criticizing the system and defending the human rights. Minutes after the play was staged, it was interrupted by military forces present at the school. Nuri was jailed and tortured severely and he was questioned repetitively mainly to confess if he ever had relations with opposition activists to which Nuri's answer was always negative. After a series of harsh tortures, Nuri lost his ability of moving hands and legs and his internal health started to deteriorate. He was sent to hospital as he was still under control. Finally as the result of fatal damages to Nuri's body, SAVAK stopped its control and Nuri came back to his family who were then residing at Torbat-e Jam. It was there that he sat in a wheelchair and started to hold the brush with his mouth and continued painting. Marriage After the revolution, Nuri again decided to write plays and staged them in different cities. In a speech he made for the students of Sharif University of Technology, Nadia Maftouni, who was a student of Applied physics, fell in love with Nuri and proposed to him. Nuri accepted and she left her studies to live with Nuri in Torbat-e Jam. They have two sons; Abolfazl Nuri and Mahmoud Nuri. Later, they moved to Mashhad, and afterwards to Tehran. Painting Style In 2004, Nuri introduced his new style in painting in an exhibition he held in Paris. It was based on the painter's intention to create a certain design out of an abstract process. The outcome was a combination of improvisation and calculated design. French painters suggested the name \\"Reflection\\" (R√©flexion) for the style, which Nuri approved. Nuri does this process with materials such as oil-color and acrylic on large canvas and particularly the large scale of his works is one of his contributions to abstract painting. The use of bright colors and recurrence of butterflies are other characteristics of his style. Theatrical Career Hossein Nuri Theater Nuri's theatrical career was revived after the revolution and it wasn't ever secondary to his painting career. In the 80s and 90s He wrote and staged several award-winning plays including The Purgatory Stop, The Crimson Robe, The Last Festival, The Circus, The Company, The Wayfarer, Sweetheart and Intuition. As an established character in Iranian theater history, a theater in city of Mashhad, which is one of Iran's theatrical poles, was named after him as Ustad Hossein Nuri Theater. Tributes Ian Linden, Professor of Religious Studies at SOAS who teaches on Christian-Muslim relations, recounts a story from his time in Tehran: \\"When there was a demonstration in front of the Danish Embassy in protest against the cartoons negatively caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad, an artist, who had lost the use of both arms, had managed while holding the paint brush in his teeth, to create a beautiful painting of Mary. He displayed the image and asked a question: This is our faith.

Education and career Marino graduated from Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows, New York City.Hamilton, William L. (February 5, 2004). \\"The Palace Maker\\". The New York Times. p. F1. Marino earned a degree from the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. Marino began his architectural career working for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, George Nelson, and I.M. Pei. In 1978, Andy Warhol hired him to do a renovation project for his townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the third incarnation of Warhol's Factory at 860 Broadway. His work for Warhol led to residential commissions from clients in the art world as well as the European aristocracy. =Notable projects= Chanel, Ginza, Tokyo In 1985, the Pressman family, who owned Barneys New York at the time, hired Marino to design the women's retail concept for the department store. This was Marino‚Äôs first retail project, which led to his designing 17 freestanding Barneys department stores in the U.S. and Japan between 1986 and 1993. Marino's work for Barneys put him in contact with other fashion designers for whom he went on to design boutiques, such as Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna and Fendi, and eventually Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. Armani, Madison Avenue, New York City In 1996, Marino designed a freestanding boutique on New York City's Madison Avenue for Giorgio Armani. In 2004, The New York Times reported that Marino is ‚Äúwidely credited with proving the theory that architectural design can be a strong component of a shopper's identification with a brand‚Äù, citing the freestanding Giorgio Armani flagship Marino designed in 1996 on Madison Avenue as the embodiment of Armani's ‚Äútrademark minimalism.‚Äù The article also references the 2004 Chanel tower in Japan‚Äôs Ginza district, ‚Äúthat takes Coco Chanel's signature black and white tweed and explodes it into three dimensions.\\" The 56-meter high building incorporated a curtain wall of glass encapsulating a nest-shaped block of aluminum in Chanel handbags‚Äô signature tweed pattern. Notable features included a first of its kind interactive glass facade with 700,000 embedded light-emitting diodes, and a system of 1,120 square meters of canvas roll blinds and state-changing electronic privacy glass which allowed office workers to see out during the day, while providing a black background for the display at night. In 2007, Marino's first luxury condominium high rise project opened at 170 East End Avenue in New York City. The building has an expansive marble lobby, leading out to a garden and waterfall in the back. In October 2014, Marino designed the flagship store in Seoul, Korea's Cheongdam-dong neighborhood for Boontheshop, a retail brand owned by Shinsegae, a South Korean luxury product specialist. The 55,000 square foot project consists of two angular buildings clad in white marble, connected by glass bridges. It was Marino's first multi- brand store since the Barney's project. In January 2015, Marino completed the flagship Louis Vuitton shop on Rodeo Drive, in Beverly Hills, California. The design included a three-layer facade consisting of louver-like stainless steel ribbons over glass over squares of white fabric, which LA Times' fashion reporter Adam Tschorn described as being designed to create an indoor/outdoor feeling. Louis Vuitton, Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills Awards and recognition In 2012, Marino was awarded the Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture in recognition of his significant contributions to the arts in France. Personal life Marino is married to the costume designer Jane Trapnell; the couple have a daughter. Marino is an art collector; collecting French porcelain, contemporary paintings, modern art, and French and Italian bronzes from the mid 16th to the mid 18th century. Marino's collection of bronzes was displayed at London's Wallace Collection in 2010. He is also notable for his personal fashion style, which he has called a \\"tattooed biker look\\", but just as a \\"decoy\\". It features mostly black clothing, leather with buckles and studs, and a leather cap.

The standards were issued in 2011 and became effective in 2013. IFRS 10 addresses consolidated financial statements, IFRS 11 addresses joint ventures and IFRS 12 address disclosures of interests in other entities. The standards were developed in part in response to the financial crisis of 2008. During the crisis, accounting rules were criticized for permitting certain risky arrangements to be excluded from company balance sheets. IFRS 10 revised the definition of having \\"control\\" of another entity, and thus requiring that entity to be consolidated onto the controlling entity's balance sheet. The revised definition is expected to increase the likelihood that an entity is deemed to have control over another. IFRS 11 largely retained previous accounting guidance for joint ventures, but adopted the IFRS 10 definition of \\"control,\\" meaning that \\"joint control\\" would be deemed to exist in some circumstances where it wasn't previously, and vice versa. IFRS 12 requires the disclosures related to subsidiaries, joint ventures and interests in other entities which are not consolidated to be combined into a single disclosure. It also requires disclosures about judgements used to determine whether control exists, why it determined that control did not exist and its relationship with entities it did not consolidate. These extra disclosures were also in response of criticism of the previous accounting guidance in light of the financial crisis. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which promulgates accounting standards in the United States, also revised its consolidation rules in response to the financial crisis, although its revised guidance is not identical to IFRS 10, 11 and 12.

Nutritional value Seal blubber and meat was studied to help understand the nutritional composition. Two species were evaluated by the Department of Biology of the University of Bergen and the National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research. The species were the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) and harp seal (Phagophilus groenlandicus). The specimens used in the study were taken from Greenland's West Ice. Seal meat in general is lean, containing less than 2% fat. This fat is mostly MUFAs, long- and very long chain omega-3 PUFAs. Also, the meat is high in protein and has an amino acid composition that is well balanced. Seal meat hanging to dry on St. Lawrence Island The study showed significant differences in nutritional composition from one seal to another. This may have been due to the highly varied age and size of the seals tested. In general, both the meat and blubber can be considered to be high quality food in terms of bioactive components and nutrients. On average, a woman's recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 and iron can be met with only 40 grams of seal meat. A significant difference between species was found in the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content of both the meat and blubber. Harp seal blubber contained 9.2% while the muscle tissue contained only 3%. High levels of trace elements were found. In particular, hooded seal muscle meat contained 379 Œºg/g of iron and harp seal muscle meat contained 30 Œºg/g of zinc.

Warfield married Elizabeth Ridgley of Laurel in 1771 and settled in a log home at \\"Bushy Park\\". The same year he started construction on his slave plantation manor home. On 19 October 1774, Warfield and his neighbors travelled to Annapolis and burned the Peggy Stewart in retaliation to sanctions on Americans following the Boston Tea Party. Paintings of the incident are displayed in the State House at Annapolis and the Court House at Baltimore. In 1866 Charles D. Warfeild sold the 270 acre and 160 acre Bushy Park tracts containing an eight room stone and frame house, including two tenant houses, blacksmith shop, 250 tree apple orchard and 73 tree peach orchard. The property later was owned by the \\"Hammond\\" family of the Major Charles family line. The manor stood for over 150 years, burned in 1933, and was demolished in 1947. A new house was built over the original foundation. In 1978, the property was purchased by the Clevenger family and had been subdivided down to 342 acres, but was still actively farmed. In 1983, it had been subdivided down to a 190-acre parcel named \\"Bushy Park Farm\\" and sold again. A portion of the original estate became the Carr's Mill Landfill, which became a site of hazardous waste dumping by Western Electric in the 1970s. Howard County spent millions of dollars to cap the landfill and dispose of hazardous materials after contamination of groundwater on the site. Warfield is buried at Bushy Park.

Career  Ksenofontov was born in Sverdlovsk in the family of metallurgical engineer Boris Maksimovich Ksenofontov, professor at the Ural State Technical University, and Galina Seregina, professor at the Ural State Mining University. He had a younger sister Tatyana. Although his parents didn't consider it a serious occupation, he liked sport from the very young age and took part in regional competitions in volleyball, swimming, figure skating. As a member of Sverdlovsk figure skating team, he was coached by Evgeny Kuzminykh. After he graduated from school Ksenofontov spend a year working in metallurgy, which he later remembered as a job for \\"strong men\\", but monotonous. In 1958 he moved to Omsk and entered the Siberian Academy of Physical Culture, after graduation in 1962 taught at the Faculty of Cycle Sport and Speed Skating. Since 1963 he had been working as a figure skating judge. In 1964 he returned to Sverdlovsk and started teaching at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport (Ural State Technical University). He founded the first figure skating school () for children in Sverdlovsk, opened on March 1, 1969. Ksenofontov became a headmaster. Among the coaches were Agnessa Dunayeva, Nelya Dronova, Valery Dolgov, Anatoly Mikhalev, Leonid Rakultsev and others. They helped to create a unique system of skaters' selection and training. In the 1970s sportsmen from Ksenofontov's school started to show noticeable results at the international competitions (particularly in pair skating, later in ladies' single skating). By the 1980s his school was widely known in the USSR. In 1981 the USSR Sport Committee ordered Ksenofontov's school to create a group to train specifically for the national team. Ksenofontov left the headmaster's position to coach this group, and moved to Pervouralsk, which had a better ice rink. Since 1990 he coached many figure skaters and coaches from China, the Israel Olympic team at the 1994 Winter Olympics; national team of Uzbekistan in 1993‚Äî1999. Ksenofontov died from a heart failure in a train on his way to Bulgaria, in Kazan.  Personal life  In 1975 Ksenofontov met his wife Galina Abramycheva (Sizova), an architect.

The genus contains a single described species, Asymphylomyrmex balticus and is known from a group of Middle Eocene fossils which were found in Europe.  History and classification  When described by William Morton Wheeler, Asymphylomyrmex was known only from ten separate fossil ants, the holotype worker, number K4305, plus another nine workers which are fossilized as inclusions in transparent chunks of Baltic amber. Baltic amber is approximately forty-six million years old, having been deposited during the Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate as to what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting relatives of either Agathis or Pseudolarix genera trees. When first described, the type worker along with two other workers in a single amber piece, were in the private collection of Professor Richard Klebs of K√∂nigsberg University, who first interested Wheeler on working with Baltic amber ant specimens. The remaining seven workers were present in the University of K√∂nigsberg amber collection. All the specimens showed varying degrees of clouding in the amber or are in less than favorable positions for study. The fossils were first studied by Wheeler, then a paleoentomologist with Harvard University, who placed the species in a new genus Asymphylomyrmex. Wheeler's 1915 type description of the new species and genus was published in the journal Schriften der Physikalisch- Okonomischen Gesellschaft zu K√∂nigsberg. Based on the structure of the head and thorax, and on the lack of spurs on the middle and hind tibia, Wheeler suggested that the species was a highly derived group which did not leave any descendants, having gone fully extinct. This group of characteristics led to erecting a new genus in Dolichoderinae rather than placing the species into an existing genus. A 2009 study on Central and Eastern European noted that at least one additional specimen of Asymphylomyrmex had been studied, from Rovno amber in Northern Ukraine. Description It is estimated the workers would have been around long overall. A. balticus individuals have heads which are nearly orbicular, but slightly flattened on the rear portions. The eyes are large, slightly rounded in cross section, and placed along the sides. The ocelli are present but spaced far apart. The mandibles are slender, straight near the base then curving inwards towards the tips. The apex and central areas of the mandibles have large teeth present, while the basal area behind the central tooth is finely serrate. The mouth is surrounded by both maxillary and labial palpi. The maxillary palpi have four joints, while the labial palpi are only three-jointed. The antennae are composed of twelve segments, the terminal segments flaring slightly forming an indistinct club shape. The head and thorax have a fine punctate structuring to the exoskeleton, and are coloured an overall ferruginous red. The thorax shows a widening at the join between the pronotum and the mesonotum, then slopes towards the epinotum.

After 1919, Truant was transferred to the Columbia River. Construction Truant was built by George C. Walker of Toledo, Oregon, for the Modern Improvement Company, also of Toledo. Truant was launched on Saturday, October 2, 1909. Following the launch, the boat was taken from the yard over to the town of Toledo where the machinery would be installed. The new boat would be about the same size as the Ella May. In early November 1909, the boiler and engine had been installed, while the company was building simultaneously a steam-driven pile driver on a barge. The company was also engaged at the same time in erecting a steam-driven pile driver on a barge. Design and power Truant was reported in the press to be long. Truant official registered dimensions were length of , beam of and depth of hold. These dimensions basically match those furnished in 1956 by Truant owner, Jack Fogarty. Truant tonnage (a measure of carrying capacity and not of weight) was 33 gross tons and 29 net tons. Total crew required was two. Power was supplied by a steeple double compound steam engines with cylinders 5 and 10 inches in diameter, with a 6-inch stroke, generating 80 horsepower. There was one Roberts boiler. The value of the boat as constructed was $6,000. Truant official merchant vessel registry number was 206932. In 1911 the boat's home port was shown as Yaquina, Oregon. Owners As of January 14, 1910, George C. Walker, builder of Truant, was associated with the Modern Improvement Company, the owner of the vessel. On November 29, 1911, as a result of apparently acrimonious disagreements among the shareholders, the Modern Improvement Company was dissolved. The elaborately descriptive dissolution notice stated: Jack Fogarty, who became owner of the Truant in 1911, lived in Toledo for five years while he operated the boat. In May 1913, Maurice Anderson bought an interest in the towing and pile-driving business of Capt. Jack Fogarty. At the same time, Anderson also become part owner of Truant. The new firm would be known as Fogarty & Anderson. Operations Advertisement for Truant, 1915, showing range of service provided. Truant was engaged in carrying freight and passengers and doing towing service on Yaquina Bay and river until 1919. On February 11, 1910, the steamboat had been in the vicinity of Elk City, Oregon, for a few days with the company‚Äôs pile driver. On Sunday March 6, 1910, Truant carried the committee which was charged with the responsibility of taking the soundings on several sand bars in the river between Toledo and Oysterville, Oregon. The measurements were taken at low tide and were reported to have been ‚Äúmost gratifying.‚Äù Truant first regular run was scheduled to be an excursion from Toledo to Newport, Oregon on Sunday, April 24, 1910. The steamer was scheduled to leave Toledo at 9 a.m., and depart Newport on the return trip at 6 p.m. The round trip fare would be 50 cents. The owners intended to make regular Sunday excursions to Newport during the coming summer of 1910. In the first part of the week of December 9, 1910, steamboat inspectors Welden and Ames from Portland were in Toledo and inspected Truant. In the week prior to October 13, 1916, Truant was at the Hanson shipyard for repairs to be put into ‚Äúfirst class shape‚Äù for the winter season. Grounding On Saturday, May 8, 1910 Truant carried about twenty- five people from Newport up to Toledo for a dance. On the return trip, the boat ran into a dense fog. At about 2 a.m., the boat ran aground on the south beach of Yaquina Bay. The Yaquina Bay life-saving crew, under the command of Captain Wellendar, heard steam exhausting and went to investigate. They found Truant and with two trips, took off the passengers. There was no damage to the boat and no one was hurt. An ocean navigator, Paul Perkins, had been on board Truant, and he reported that Captain Fogarty had done all he could and remained cool. The boat itself was not able to get off until the next morning, and was then due at 10 a.m. at Toledo to pick up an excursion bound for Elk City. When Truant came within sight of the waiting crowd at Elk City, the boat broke its propeller shaft. Excursions Advertisement for Truant, 1911. On the Saturday night before June 3, 1910, took over 60 people from Toledo to Newport to watch a boxing match. Because Truant was only licensed to carry 50 passengers, the excess persons were transported on board the launch Chicora and towed behind Truant. On the Fourth of July, 1910, Truant was scheduled to make extra excursion runs from Toledo to Newport, to leave Toledo at 7 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 7:30 p.m., and departing Newport for Toledo at 10 a.m., 6 p.m., and immediately after the dance at night. The round trip fare was 75 cents, 25 cents more than the usual Sunday excursion fare to Newport on Truant. On the Sunday, August 14, 1910, Newport had a large clam bake at which served, by one report, over 2,500 people, and by another report, about 4,000 There was a ‚Äúvast crowd‚Äù which ‚Äúfilled the town to overflowing.‚Äù Over 1,000 people had come in to Toledo on a train from the Willamette Valley, and they were transported from there to Newport by Truant, the steamer Newport, and many launches, with Truant itself carrying about 140. To accommodate so many passengers was well beyond the capacity of both Truant and Newport, and so each steamer towed a barge carrying passengers. Accident on board Truant, some time between 1910 and 1919. On the Saturday before July 5, 1912, as Truant was leaving Toledo and headed downriver, engineer Jack Fogarty, who was also one of the owners of the boat, got his arm entangled with the machinery. The cause of the accident appears to have been his sleeve catching on a bolt head. Fogarty‚Äôs wife was on board, in the cabin. He called out to her for help, but when she attempted to stop the engines, she threw the throttle the wrong way, and increased their speed. She in turn called out to Frank Fogarty, Jack‚Äôs brother, who was in the pilot house, and he was able to quickly stop the engines. According to one report, Jack Fogarty‚Äôs arm was badly cut and bruised, and it was thought that he would not be able to return to work for weeks. According to another report, Fogarty‚Äôs arm was almost pulled from its socket and his right side was seriously injured. Salvage of the Frederick On December 13, 1913, the barge Frederick, owned by the Porter Brothers, of Portland was wrecked on the jetty at the entrance to Yaquina Bay and beached. Frederick was carrying 60 tons of dynamite, which was removed and placed onto a smaller barge. During the night, the smaller barge carrying the dynamite broke its moorings. Truant and the steam tug Fearless were on hand and started in pursuit, eventually capturing the loose barge. While this was happening along shore people sought cover against the possible explosion of the dynamite. A few days later Frederick in turn broke its moorings, and sank all the way up to the pilot house of the barge. Another loss occurred during this situation when a scow chartered by the Porter Brothers from Jack Fogarty became jammed and had both ends stove in. Later years In about 1919, Truant was converted to a motor vessel, driven by an 80-horsepower Standard gasoline engine. In 1920, Truant was registered as a gasoline-powered vessel, gross tons 26 and net tons 23, with the home port shown as Newport, Oregon. By 1924, the steamboat had been reduced in size to 17 gross and 6 net tons, and was running freight only. In 1925, Truant was registered with a new home port, Portland, Oregon, under the ownership of Herman Loesch, whose office was at 395 East Morrison Street, as the registered owner. This continued to be the case in 1935, although the boat was listed as being used for fishery purposes.

The Mets won the game 4-3 with Alvarez giving up an RBI single to Christian Yelich which the tied the game for the Marlins with him being charged with a blown save. √Ålvarez finished the season with a 13.50 ERA in 4 games in 1.1 innings pitched while giving up 4 hits, 2 runs, and one home run while only getting one strikeout with a WHIP of 3.000. 2015 √Ålvarez was promoted up to the majors on August 22 with first baseman Lucas Duda going on the disable list with a back injury. On August 23 he was sent back to the Las Vegas 51s to make room for David Wright who was making his return from Spinal stenosis. He did not make a single appearance when he was called up a day earlier. He was recalled on September 4 to be available to pitch against the Miami Marlins. On September 7, √Ålvarez got his first career win against the Washington Nationals by striking out outfielder Bryce Harper in the bottom of the 6th inning. On September 15, √Ålvarez strained his groin with one out in the eight inning against the Marlins forcing him to leave in what would be a 3-9 loss for the Mets. He had allowed 3 hits and exited the game after stumbling and failing to deliver a pitch, which resulted in a balk. On September 18 it was revealed that √Ålvarez was headed to Port St. Lucie to rehab the groin injury he had sustained three days ago and that it was unlikely for him to pitch again in 2015. √Ålvarez finished the season with a 1-0 record, 12.27 ERA in 6 games in 3.2 innings pitched while giving up 5 hits, 5 runs, 2 home runs, 1 walk, and 1 balk while getting two strikeouts with a WHIP of 1.636.

Political career Sharkey's early adulthood coincided with the rise to power of William Tweed, a notoriously corrupt politician who, by 1870 if not earlier, had successfully manipulated the New York City government and its treasury to serve himself and his political cronies. Sharkey and his gang soon came to the attention of Tweed and his associates, who saw an opportunity to feed Sharkey's ambition while serving their own goals. With their assistance, Sharkey became a \\"politician of no mean influence...

Other House librarians included Calvin Clifford Chaffee, a physician and abolitionist who represented Springfield, Massachusetts as a congressman during the 34th and 35th Congresses from 1855 to 1859. Chaffee's political career suffered after he and the public learned in 1857 that his wife, Irene Sanford Emerson, owned several slaves, including the enslaved American Dred Scott. After his stint as a congressman, Chaffee served as house librarian during the 36th Congress, from until 1859 - 1861.How Overdue Books Caused the Civil War William H.

Lewis (born Jacob Lanis) and Rose Grossman. Jacob had immigrated to the United States, alone, at the age of 17 in 1916, during an era of antisemitic pogroms in Siberia. J.A. Lewis donated the land for the park in Hayward, California that bears his name. He was later able to bring one of his brothers, but Russia restricted emigration, and he was unable to get his other family members out of Russia. Ray was born in Oakland, Alameda County, California on November 30, 1928, grew up and attended high school there. He then attended the University of California at Berkeley, earning bachelor and master degrees.Obituary, EMANUEL R. LEWIS Washington Post, June 2014 Military service Lewis was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps, but it was abolished shortly after his commission. He was then transferred to Military Intelligence, where he served from 1954 to 1956. As Lewis‚Äô parents spoke Russian in the home, he was a fluent speaker of Russian. He was assigned the position of commander for a group of Soviet military defectors, and given the responsibility for testing security at military bases. He retired as a captain. His ashes are inurned in the Columbarium at Arlington National Cemetery. Professional career After his military service he earned a PhD in educational psychology at the University of Oregon, with a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He became a tenured psychology professor in the Oregon University System. Lewis was among the first psychology professors to participate in the creation of the Oregon State Board of Psychologist Examiners, and the first Oregon professor to teach on campus through television.

It is named for the city of Milton- Freewater, Oregon, and a unique alluvial fan resulting in rocky soils with \\"baseball sized\\" basalt cobbles covering the earth, and is notable as being \\"the only AVA in the United States whose boundaries are defined by the soil type\\". Unique wine flavors are said to result from the mineral composition, hydrology, and temperatures of the volcanic rocks. History Washington State geologist and terroir consultant Kevin Pogue submitted the proposal for the new AVA to the U.S. government. The AVA was published for comment in the Federal Register in February 2014, and was established in February 2015. Controversies The AVA, unlike the Walla Walla Valley AVA, and the Walla Walla Valley itself, lies entirely within the state of Oregon. This has implications for use of the appellation on wines produced in Oregon and Washington. Because Federal rules require wines to be fully finished in the state in which the AVA lies, only a handful of Oregon wineries, out of the more than 100 wineries in both states in the Walla Walla Valley, would be permitted to use the appellation on their product. At the same time, Oregon wineries as far away as Portland could use the appellation. This has caused some, labeled \\"prominent dissenters\\" by Wine Spectator's Harvey Steiman, to oppose the AVA. Other reactions were less pointed with wine publishers using terms like \\"a bit of controversy\\" and \\"the location...creates some nuances\\". One of the same publishers said a \\"sub-appellation was ... inevitable given the uniqueness of the soils and resulting wines\\". Critical reception Wine Spectator's two top-rated Northwest wines , both Syrahs, and both of which scored 98 out of 100, were from the AVA.

Its building is Grade II* listed History and architecture Cardinal Wiseman donated the land on which to build the church, and on 6 May 1851 he laid the foundation stone. It is built of Kentish ragstone and cost about ¬£20,000 to complete. Helen, Countess Tasker, a benefactor of several Roman Catholic church and school projects, gave ¬£4,000. The church was opened on 26 July 1853. The architect was William Wardell, who designed the church in a Gothic Revival rendition of Decorated Gothic. It has north and south side aisles and the nave is lit by a clerestory. The nave and chancel have arch- braced roofs. The building has stained glass windows by John Hardman. From the beginning, Holy Trinity served a growing Catholic community in the area, initially boosted by the Irish mass migrations to Great Britain. In 1862 a school for girls and infants was built behind the church to designs by Joseph John Scoles. In 1894 the children were transferred to the nearby Sacred Heart School and the former school building became the parish rooms. The church has a southwest tower, with a spire that was added later. Sources disagree as to whether the spire was added in 1867 or 1871. Most sources agree that it was designed by Joseph Hansom, although Nikolaus Pevsner originally attributed it to his brother Charles Francis Hansom. The present presbytery was completed in 1964. Holy Trinity today Inside the church, looking east to the chancel Today Holy Trinity serves an ethnically diverse parish as the demographics of the parish change. There is a sizable French-speaking population because the church is near the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Charles de Gaulle in nearby South Kensington. It is also used by the Syriac Catholic Church, who hold Mass here in Arabic and Aramaic on Sunday afternoons.

Early life Reginald Brie was born in Egham, Surrey. After leaving school, he started an electrical engineering apprenticeship in Southall. World War I In 1914, he joined the Royal Field Artillery, and in early 1915 he served in the Somme region. He was then posted to Salonika as an artillery spotter. He was promoted to Sergeant, and sent back to England for officer training. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and trained as an observer. He was posted to No. 104 Squadron at RAF Andover. In May 1918, he moved with the squadron to Azelot. On one mission, his Airco DH.9 was attacked by German fighters, and a forced landing was made. He and his pilot were captured, and they served as prisoners of war until December 1918.Britain's Test Pilots No.17 (Flight 1946, p. 231)Brie, Reginald A. C. (VTOLbios) RAF service 1918‚Äì1922 In early 1919, he was posted as Transport Officer to No. 2 Group RAF at Oxford. In September 1919, he was granted a short-service commission as a Flying Officer. In December 1919, he was posted to No. 99 Squadron at Risalpur. In 1920, he was posted to the Inspectorate of Recruiting in England. In August 1921, he took a pilot's course at RAF Leuchars, and went solo after 10 hours dual experience. In 1922, he left the RAF, and was retained in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). Shell and RAFVR 1922‚Äì1930 In 1922, he was employed in the sales department of Shell Oil Company. He continued to maintain his flying skills as a member of RAFVR, often via the de Havilland School of Flying at Stag Lane Aerodrome. He achieved a pilot's B licence, and became interested in autogiros. He arranged to have a flight with Valentine Baker, who was demonstrating a Cierva C.19 at Heston Aerodrome. Subsequently, he obtained 30 minutes dual instruction with Arthur 'Dizzy' Rawson in a Cierva C.19, and then went solo in it. He then gained his Commercial pilot's licence. As a result of his achievements, Air Commodore J.G. Weir offered him a short term contract as an autogiro pilot, and he resigned from his job at Shell. Cierva autogiros 1930‚Äì1939 In November 1930, he was employed by Cierva Autogiro Company as a test pilot to temporarily replace Arthur Rawson, who had been injured in a forced landing. In summer 1931, to promote sales and publicity for Cierva autogiros, he flew a Cierva C.19 Mark III with the flying circus led by C. D. Barnard, and gathered an additional 400 flying hours. In late 1931, he became Chief Pilot and Flying Manager of the Cierva company. In 1932, he helped establish the sales department and the Cierva Autogiro Flying School at London Air Park, Hanworth. When the Avro factory at Hamble was closed, the development activities of the company were also moved to Hanworth. He invited Alan Marsh to be the company Chief Flying Instructor. Throughout the 1930s, he flew Cierva autogiros in private and public demonstrations in UK and overseas, delivery flights, record attempts, informal competitions against fixed wing aircraft, and in pleasure flights with passengers. In 1933, he was convicted of \\"low and dangerous flying\\" in an autogiro over the Kingston Bypass road, adjacent to Hook Aerodrome, Surrey. He became the first pilot to win an appeal against a conviction for a flying offence, and it set a legal precedent allowing low flying near an airfield when there is no danger, irrespective of the alarm displayed by animals or motorists. In 1935, he became the first pilot to land and take off in a rotorcraft from a ship at sea.The Rise of the Helicopter (Flight 1953, p. 96) RAF service 1939‚Äì1945 In July 1940, he formed No. 1448 Flight RAF and was appointed its commanding officer. Its purpose was to operate Cierva C.30 and Cierva C.40 autogiros on flights from Duxford, to assist calibration of coastal radar installations. In April 1941, he handed over command of the unit to his former civilian colleague Alan Marsh. On 9 April 1941, he was appointed to command the Technical Development Unit at the Central Landing Establishment, based at RAF Ringway, and then assumed the rank of acting Wing Commander. The unit carried out research and development of methods such as landing troops and equipment by parachute or by glider, and notable projects were the Hafner Rotachute and Hafner Rotabuggy. While there, he collaborated with Dr J.A.J. Bennett, designer of the Cierva C.40.Jenkins 2013, p. 115 In late 1941, he was sent to the United States to promote the use of autogiros on ships for convoy protection. He advised on the development of the Pitcairn PA-39 autogiro, of which seven had been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm. In May 1942, flying a PA-39, he made the first landings on a British merchant ship. Via the British Air Commission in the US, he promoted the use of helicopters, and he was the only British pilot to fly the prototype of the Sikorsky R-4 helicopter. In 1943, he ran the first helicopter school in America, and in 1944 he conducted the first deck-landing trials with a Sikorsky R-4. In late 1945, he retired from the RAF with the rank of Wing Commander. Civil helicopters 1947‚Äì1969 In 1947, he returned to the United States on behalf of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, to report on helicopter operations. In July 1947, he was appointed as Officer in Charge of the British European Airways Helicopters (BEAH) Experimental Helicopter Unit. The unit was initially based at Gatwick Airport, then in 1948 it moved to Yeovil, from where regular mail flights were trialled in East Anglia and Dorset. He developed the commercial operations of the unit, and in 1952 set up a permanent base for it at the original site of Gatwick Airport. In 1958, he retired from BEA, and joined Westland Helicopters as Personal Assistant to the Technical Director. In 1959, he was responsible for the planning and commissioning of the Westland-owned Battersea Heliport. In 1969, he retired from Westland. He died in 1988 after a long and busy retirement.LoBao 1985 Legacy and awards Reginald Brie was a founder member of both the Helicopter Association of Great Britain, and the American Helicopter Society. He held both the No. 1 Helicopter Aviator's Certificate and a Commercial Helicopter Pilots Licence. In 1954, the Royal Aeronautical Society awarded him the British Silver Medal for Aeronautics.

He passed out from the course with an A.2 certificate, and then became an instructor at No. 2 FTS at RAF Grantham, flying Siskins and Atlases. In May 1929, he was posted to CFS as a Flight Sergeant instructor. In 1930, he left the service with an A.1 instructor's certificate, and was retained in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). Civil aviation 1930‚Äì1939 In 1930, he was employed as an instructor at the Hampshire Aero Club, and then briefly as instructor at the Scarborough Aero Club. He had flown a Cierva C.19 autogiro, and in 1932 Reggie Brie invited him to join the Cierva Autogiro Company as an instructor and demonstration pilot. He became Chief Instructor at the Cierva Autogiro Flying School at London Air Park (Hanworth Aerodrome), and instructed over 80 trainee autogiro pilots in Cierva C.19 and Cierva C.30 types. He took part in the development of direct control autogiros, and later, autogiros with \\"jump start\\" features. In 1936, after Juan de la Cierva was killed in an airline accident, Marsh took over as Chief Test Pilot for the Cierva company. He also carried out test flying for G and J Weir Ltd., that was providing financial backing for Cierva, and developing its own autogiros. Weir's designer, C. G. Pullin, became chief designer and managing director of Cierva. In 1936, Marsh was commissioned in the RAFVR.The New Autogiros (Flight 1936, p. 2050)Marsh, H. Alan (VTOLbios) RAF service 1939‚Äì1946 In late 1939, he was called up for military service, and in January 1940 took a refresher course at CFS, and he was then posted to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). In April, 1941, he took over as Commanding Officer of No. 1448 Flight RAF, that operated Cierva C.30 Rotas on radar calibration duties. In June 1943, that unit was renamed No. 529 Squadron RAF. He stayed in that post until the squadron was disbanded in 1945. He was awarded the AFC, and in early 1946 he retired from the RAF. Civil test flying 1946‚Äì1950 In 1946, he joined the Cierva Autogiro Company as General Manager and Chief Test Pilot. He carried out first flights and initial development of various autogiros and helicopter types including Weir WE.3, Westland CL.20, Cierva C.40, Cierva W.9, Cierva W.11 Air Horse, Cierva W.14 Skeeter, Bristol 171 Sycamore.Jackson 1973 Vol 2, pp. 23, 290Jackson 1973 Vol 1, p. 260 By June 1950, he had logged 6,500 flying hours, of which 3,000 were on 70 types of fixed-wing aircraft, and 3,500 on rotorcraft that included 22 types of autogiro and five helicopters. His qualifications included Pilot's A and B licences and 2nd Class Navigators licence, and he held the GAPAN (Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators) Master Instructor's Diploma. He was also the rotating-wing representative on the GAPAN Panel of Examiners. On 13 June 1950, he was piloting the prototype Cierva W.11 Air Horse (VZ724) helicopter, when a transmission failure caused it to crash near Eastleigh, Hampshire, killing all three crew, Alan Marsh, John \\"Jeep\\" Cable, and Joseph K. Unsworth.Air Horse Tragedy (Flight 1950, p. 1189) Legacy In 1946, Alan Marsh was instrumental in the formation of the Helicopter Association of Great Britain (HAGB), and became its first chairman. In 1956, his friends in the HAGB, headed by Reggie Brie, formed the Alan Marsh Memorial Trust Fund, to support technical training in the rotary wing field, and to award an annual medal for outstanding pilotage achievement in the subject.In Memory of Alan Marsh (Flight 1956, p. 253) Notes References *Jackson, A.J. 1973.

The work explores six months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency: the period between July 12, 1862 and January 1, 1863 when Lincoln penned the Emancipation Proclamation and changed the course of the Civil War. During this time Lincoln struggled with his strategy for the war, quarreled with his cabinet, and wrestled with how best to free the slaves. Lincoln‚Äôs Gamble was published on September 9, 2014. Background Lincoln‚Äôs Gamble is Brewster's fourth book. Brewster previously collaborated with the late Peter Jennings to write The Century, The Century for Young People, and In Search of America. \\"The Emancipation Proclamation is one of the three most important documents in American history, and yet it is by far the least known,\\" Brewster said in an interview with dailyhistory.org: Brewster's quest led him to focus on the six months between July 1862 and January 1863 which \\"served as a neatly contained episode of Lincoln‚Äôs life in that they framed the time when he first mentioned the Proclamation and the date when he actually signed the document. More than that, those six months were some of the most turbulent for Lincoln, the nation, and the war.\\" The Lincoln that Brewster discovered was a man wracked by uncertainty, doubt and psychological pain. The author's introduction leans heavily on a quote from the great black leader W. E. B. DuBois who had once described Lincoln as \\"a Southern poor white, of illegitimate birth, poorly educated‚Ä¶ unusually ugly‚Ä¶ and a politician down to his toes.\\" Although DuBois initially derides Lincoln, he goes on to say that he loves Lincoln \\"‚Ä¶not because he was perfect, but because he was not and yet triumphed.\\" Central argument Describing the central argument of the book, Brewster wrote: Reception Lincoln‚Äôs Gamble has received favorable reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the way \\"Brewster brings elegant clarity to the tangle of conflicting ideologies, loyalties, and practicalities that pushed the proclamation forward, ultimately ensuring Lincoln‚Äôs legacy as the Great Emancipator.\\" Ken Burns, the director and producer of the acclaimed documentary The Civil War, also lauded the book, stating: \\"It‚Äôs hard to act from strength and a higher moral conviction when the war you‚Äôre waging is not going well. But in this wonderful study, Todd Brewster authoritatively evokes the strategy of our best president to change the terms of the Civil War and thereby the destiny of his nation.\\" In another positive review Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, the American military historian who wrote Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam, commented that: A recurring theme throughout reviews of Lincoln‚Äôs Gamble is the way Brewster successfully captured the flawed and often indecisive man that Lincoln was, not the larger-than-life legend Lincoln subsequently became. This was Brewster's goal; as critic Gilbert Taylor explained in his Booklist review: ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos praised this facet of Brewster's work, writing: \\"Brewster gets inside Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs mind, revealing his struggles with the limited powers of his office. Here is Lincoln, the man, surprisingly ambivalent about the decision for which he is most remembered. A masterful psychological portrait.\\" Similarly, Joseph J. Ellis, American historian and bestselling author of the Pulitzer Prize- winning book Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation, emphasized the way Brewster opened a window into the indecision that plagued Lincoln, noting how: \\"This story has been told before, but never as well, with such a firm grasp of the revolutionary implications of Lincoln‚Äôs decision, or the multilayered levels of Lincoln‚Äôs quite tortured thought process. Although Lincoln is the most written-about figure in American history, Brewster‚Äôs book is a major entry in the Lincoln sweepstakes.\\" See also * Abraham Lincoln * Todd Brewster * American Civil War * Emancipation Proclamation * W.

Blue Grass Roots. Quarterly Journal of the Kentucky Genealogical Society. Frankfurt, Kentucky. Vol. 38, No. 2: 2011. pp. 30-37. It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history, and its modern location is near Brooks, in north-central Bullitt County, Kentucky. The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town. (Low Dutch Station's historical marker is at the intersection of Browns Lane, Bowling Parkway and Kresge Way, just northeast of Baptist East Hospital in St. Matthews.) The caravan's route took them south via what would become Old Shepherdsville Road all the way to present Shepherdsville, before turning east-southeast down the trails along the Salt Fork River, taking them through modern Spencer County all the way to Harrodsburg. But they never even made it to Shepherdsville. The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky. The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians (where St. Matthews Mall is now). Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north. The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles. The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known. However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run. (After years of research, Kentucky historians have finally agreed that the site is knowable within a few hundred yards, and have erected a new official Kentucky state historical marker, as of September 2019.) The Westervelt (also known as \\"Westerfield\\") caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families. Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family. The victims included men, women, and children. The Indians responsible for the massacre were allied to the British and received ¬£5 for each victim's scalp cut off and returned to the British authorities. The Indians were thus awarded ¬£85 by the British for massacring the Dutch settlers. The Westervelt Massacre had a chilling effect on the region. A number of settlers from Low Dutch Station joined Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia after the massacre. Historical background Population density in the American Colonies in 1775. At the time of the Westervelt Massacre, in 1780, Kentucky was part of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Westervelt family arrived during the American Revolutionary War and were among the first colonists to settle in the territory. Following the Second Virginia Charter in 1609, the territory claimed by the English Colony of Virginia was expanded to cover the modern US state of Kentucky. However, the areas claimed by Virginia were in name only and would not be officially explored by the British until 1750. A scouting party, led by Dr. Thomas Walker, returned with reports of indigenous activities, topographical surveys, and botanical research. During the expedition, the first house was also built in Kentucky. However, Walker and his scouting party returned to the colonies. The area would not be permanently settled by Westerners until 1775, during the beginning stages of the American Revolutionary War. In 1780, Hendrick Banta led a large contingent of Dutch from Pennsylvania into Kentucky, where they began the settlement of Low Dutch Station along Beargrass Creek. In the spring of 1780, Dutchman Jacobus Westervelt and his family arrived in Kentucky County, Virginia. They were among the earliest wave of frontier settlers. The Westervelts were one of the founding families of the Low Dutch Station settlement. However, by the summer of 1780, the Westervelt family prepared to move to Harrod's Town, Kentucky. The region was becoming increasingly dangerous with Indian raids. Likewise, the British invasion of 750 men from the Province of Quebec, led by Captain Henry Bird, resulted in many settlers seeking safer territory. The British army crossed into Kentucky on May 25, 1780. On June 21, 1780, Jacobus Westervelt purchased 400 acres of land in the area of Harrod's Town. Shortly thereafter, Jacobus Westervelt hired John Thixton as a guide for the caravan. The Dutch families gathered in Low Dutch Station the following weekend, setting out on June 26, 1780. The massacre First account testimonies of the Westervelt massacre were preserved in the manuscripts of Lyman C. Draper in 1865. According to the reports, the caravan camped by running water approximately twelve miles from Low Dutch Station.Lyman C. Draper. The Draper Manuscript, Boone Papers, Series C, Vol. 24: 1865. p. 145. The families that were traveling included the Westervelts, Swans, McGlaughlins, Plyburns, and Thixtons. In the darkness of early morning, the settlers were awakened to the sounds of carnage. As historian Ronald Belcher wrote: > Survivors from the attack recounted hearing hacking sounds, chopping, > \\"crackling of skulls, plundering and screaming\\", joined by the sound of > volleys discharged from muskets. In moments, about half the members of the > Westervelt group were slaughtered despite valiant attempts by the men to > protect the women and children. Fewer than half of the approximately forty > settlers managed to escape. The majority of the men were killed within minutes.Lyman C. Draper. The Draper Manuscript, Kentucky Papers, Series CC, Vol. 13: 1865. pp. 11-12. The only men that managed to escape were the frontier guides: John Thixton, William Thixton, and Thomas Pearce. Several of the wives and children were also killed, while others were taken prisoner.

Founded in 1972, its production range includes watches, watch movements and components. History The Hangzhou Watch Factory was established in the city of Hangzhou in 1972 with export rights granted from the outset. Initial production was the Standard watch, designated ZHZ with 19 jewels and branded Xihu (West Lake) after the famous landmark near the city. Xihu watches were at one time awarded the top national award for quality. As resources permitted, the factory introduced a new woman-sized watch with an in-house designed small calibre. These watches were also branded Xihu, and that name was also engraved on the movement. In the 1980s, the factory introduced an automatic Xihu watch. This was a man-sized watch, but the movement was based on the small Xihu calibre with an enlarged dial plate and a very simple auto-winding module with a large rotor. The changing demands of the market required a higher grade of automatic movement, the 2000 series, which was developed based on the older Seiko calibre 7009 design, but with some detail differences such as a smaller balance wheel. Almost no parts are interchangeable between Seiko and Hangzhou calibres. Besides the basic date and day/date versions, there are also skeleton, triple-date, dual-time and jump-hour versions. The 2000 calibres have been used by many international brands, including Orion (Russia) and Stuhrling (with calibres designated 'Lexus'). The Hangzhou Watch Company is now partnered with PTS Resources, Hong Kong. This has enhanced the company through investment in new PTS calibre designs and has expanded Hangzhou's customer base.

The University of Virginia has an honor code, formally known as the Honor System. The Honor System is intended to be student administered. It was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death. The University had at that point a 17-year history of ongoing tensions between students and faculty over strictly enforced discipline, hours, and dress. Students, sons of the most prominent families of Virginia, found particularly galling the impugning of their honor by stringent supervision during tests: \\"[t]he students were allowed to bring only a pencil to the classroom, they were forbidden to speak, and the professors, operating in shifts, watched them with 'lynx-like' eyes during the course of the examinations.\\" Law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., proposed a basic honor pledge as an alternative to faculty oversight.TUCKER, Henry St. George ‚Äì Biographical Information Originally the honor system only applied to allegations of cheating, although it was subsequently expanded to hold students to a general standard of gentlemanly conduct: the shared values of an all white, all male Southern aristocratic tradition. In modern times, however, the Honor System is composed of only three simple tenets: a student will not lie, cheat, or steal. It extends to matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the university. This is called the \\"single sanction system\\". A plaque regarding 150 years of the Honor System, placed on the Lawn in 1992 The system is not without its detractors‚Äîit has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon. Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded. Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the spring of 2007 a non-binding referendum to replace the single sanction with a tiered, multiple sanction system received 49.5% of the votes cast, falling just 62 votes shy of a majority. While cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), a large cheating scandal occurred in 2001. Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, suspected that some of his students copied portions of their term papers from fraternity archives in his Introduction to Physics class. After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters. Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the university. Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked. Lawsuits have challenged the honor system, such as a 1983 case brought by an expelled law student that reached the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Courts so far have concluded the system affords due process sufficient to satisfy constitutional expectations.In 1983 the Fourth Circuit rejected a challenge brought by an expelled law student, the Henson case, concluding UVA's student-run honor system afforded sufficient due process to pass constitutional scrutiny. However, there has been at least one case of UVA administration interference in an honor proceeding under the threat of a lawsuit. In 1993 an Honor Trial convicted Christopher Leggett of cheating. The Honor Committee of that year insisted Leggett had received a fair trial but President John Casteen called it flawed, after Leggett's family hired law firm Williams & Connolly. The President and Board of Visitors forced the Executive Committee of the Honor Committee to grant a new trial (not provided for in the Honor bylaws) and in the second trial the student jury acquitted Leggett.(noting the case \\"garnered a great deal of media attention and criticism among alumni and students\\"). One Honor Committee member resigned because of the administration's interference.

It had been returning to the ship after an air-to-ship missile live firing exercise, when it suffered a double engine failure. The two fatalities were Lieutenants Rod Skidmore and Jenny Lewis, the pilot and observer seated in the two-person cockpit; Lewis is believed to be the first female Royal Navy pilot or observer to die in service. A third crew member, Petty Officer Paul Hanson, survived after being rescued. He had been on board to record the exercise. The helicopter went down approximately 200 miles off the eastern seaboard of the United States, necessitating the deepest salvage operation ever undertaken by the Ministry of Defence. Both the wreckage and the body of Skidmore were recovered, but Lewis's body was never found, leading the coroner to express regret that he was only permitted in law to record a verdict on Skidmore, of accidental death.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the incident was a Lynx helicopter, which was from the Royal Naval Air Station in RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset. The 15-year-old Mark 8 Lynx was serial No. XZ256, at the time flying from the Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond. Both XZ256 and Lieutenants Skidmore and Lewis were assigned to 815 Naval Air Squadron, based at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset. Crash and rescue On 12 June 2002, HMS Richmond was participating in a training exercise with the U.S. Navy to test Sea Skua and Tomahawk missiles by firing them from a Lynx helicopter at a disused American warship at the Virginia Cape range. The Lynx helicopter attached to Richmond was being piloted by Lieutenant Rod Skidmore, 39, a British citizen and married father of two from Martinstown, Dorset. The flight observer was Lieutenant Jenny Lewis, 25, also a British citizen and one of three women in the forty-strong 815 Naval Air Squadron. Lewis had been in the Navy for four years, previously serving on HMS London and HMS Northumberland. Her family was from the Isle of Wight, and she lived in Sherborne. Also on board was Paul Hanson, a petty officer working as a photographer, from St Helens, Merseyside. He was on board to video record the launch of the missiles and the damage that they caused. Whilst returning to Richmond in fair weather, Lewis made an emergency call at low altitude around from the ship. As stated at the later inquest, Hanson heard a bang from the starboard engine, after which the helicopter nosedived into the Atlantic Ocean from a height of around . The crash occurred southeast of the US naval base at Norfolk, Virginia. A door of the helicopter was ripped off during the crash, which allowed Hanson to swim free of the craft as it started to sink. He suffered only minor injuries, while Lewis and Skidmore were killed. Five weeks later it was found that Hanson had suffered from two crushed vertebrae. Following the accident, Hanson said that he could see his fellow crew-members in the water as well, as \\"there were two green helmets, they were no more than 50 or 60 feet away from me.\\", but after he swam to them he found that they were just empty floating helmets. The wreck subsequently sank to , as deep as , with very little debris left on the surface. In the aftermath of the crash, a joint search and rescue operation was launched by British and American authorities but was called off at sunset, with only Hanson being rescued. The crew of HMS Richmond held a memorial service on 13 June near the last reported position of the helicopter, including throwing a white Royal Navy ensign into the sea at the position. Salvage operation and crash investigation Initial reports were that the craft had suffered double engine failure. The MoD stated that there were no safety issues known with the Lynx at the time of the accident. A Royal Navy board of inquiry was convened to investigate the crash, and British investigators flew to the US later in the week of the accident to interview Hanson and other involved people. Lewis was \\"the first female Lynx helicopter aircrew\\" and the first female pilot or observer to die while serving with the Royal Navy. The crash raised questions about the airworthiness of the helicopters, following from their grounding two years earlier from operational stress suffered by the core of the rotor blades, although the accident wasn't linked to that defect. It was initially reported that the crashed helicopter would not be recovered. However, MOD Salvage and Marine Operations (SALMO) Project Team later recovered the helicopter. At its depth of this made it the deepest ever recovery of a crashed aircraft. After recovery, the wreckage was transferred to the Flight Safety & Accident Investigation Centre at Yeovilton. The recovery enabled the accident investigators to identify a potentially serious defect with the aircraft, which was fixed immediately throughout the rest of the helicopter fleet. Skidmore's body was later recovered from the ocean, but Lewis's body was never recovered. The inquest into Skidmore's death, held in Dorchester on 25 June 2003, reached a verdict of accidental death for Skidmore. Coroner Michael Johnston explained that he was prevented by law from holding an inquest into Lewis's death as her body was not recovered, despite involving exactly the same circumstances - a situation he criticised while apologising to Lewis' mother. At the inquest, Hanson said that he thought that one of the engines had caught fire. Locomotive D6515 dedication D6515 at Wareham in 2017 On 12 June 2014, 12 years to the day after the crash, Lewis's death was commemorated by a flypast over Swanage station by a Lynx from RNAS Yeovilton, and the renaming of the preserved British Rail Class 33 diesel-electric locomotive No. D6515 to Lt Jenny Lewis RN. Lewis was a fan of the class. The locomotive was used to haul trains between London and Corfe Castle and Swanage in 1966, and the 77-tonne locomotive was recently overhauled to mainline standards. Lewis's father became a major shareholder in the overhaul project after her death.

Design and construction Tressa May was built in East Portland, Oregon in 1883. The boat was commissioned by Capt. Stephen B. Ives, and launched under the name Robert G. Ingersoll, as Capt. Ives was an admirer of that orator. Ives encountered financial difficulties and had to sell the new boat. The new owners renamed the vessel Tressa May. Dimensions and power The boat was long with a beam of and depth of hold of . Tressa May measured out at 48.84 gross tons (a measurement of carrying capacity, not weight) and 39.60 net tons.

The boat however had been operating in Yaquina Bay since August 1885, if not earlier. On Saturday August 8, 1885, when Tressa May was under the command of Captain Dodge, the boat was making a landing at a dock when the vessel was backed into a scow, which broke the propeller. Tressa May was replaced on the route by the Benton for the day. The next Monday morning, August 10, 1885, Captain Dodge went to Portland for a replacement propeller. In 1886 Tressa May was purchased by James T. Chatterton (b. 1851), who had earlier run the boat for a few months on a sea otter hunting expedition. One source reports that Tressa May had been built for sea-going work as Robert G. Ingersoll, but had been converted to a riverine freight and passenger service by Chatterton when he bought the boat in 1886. On March 28, 1886, Tressa May was aground at Newport, Oregon. In 1887, the home port for Tressa May was Yaquina City, Oregon.Item, Daily Morning Astorian, March 28, 1886, page 3, col. 1. In June 1887, D.H.

In December 1887, Chatterton, captain of Tressa May, was fined $1,000 in U.S. District Court for carrying excessive passengers on the steamer. Disposition John T. Chatterton operated Tressa May until 1888, when he built the steamer T.M. Richardson. Tressa May was dismantled. It was the practice to reuse machinery and other parts stripped from dismantled vessels in newer craft.

Chepkurgor originally wrote to President Clinton offering the dowry of goats and cows during Clinton's 2000 visit to Kenya. According to Muliro Telewa, a reporter for the BBC, the number of animals offered in the dowry was very generous by Kenyan standards. Chepkurgor drew worldwide attention and headlines when he publicly disclosed his offer for her hand in marriage in 2005. He told The Standard in a 2005 interview that, \\"Had I succeeded in wooing Chelsea, I would have had a grand wedding...I would have invited South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to preside at the ceremony.\\" His letter drew scrutiny from Kenyan authorities, who conducted background checks of his friends and family; he was summoned for a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which he declined to attend. On December 2, 2006, married his wife and college classmate, Grace Chepkurgor, at a ceremony held at the Kabarak University Chapel in Nakura. The couple had four children. In 2009, another Kenyan journalist brought up the subject of the 2000 marriage proposal to then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a town hall meeting with reporters. After a pause, Secretary Clinton replied saying, \\"My daughter is her own person. I will convey this very kind offer.\\" Chepkurgor expressed happiness that his original marriage offer had been renewed in an interview with the BBC. Chepkurgor added at the time that his first wife, Grace, \\"did not object\\" to his proposal to Chelsea Clinton.

The university is of secular orientation and not affiliated with any particular faith, although it does contain a College of Sharia, providing undergraduate degrees in Sunni Islamic Law. The university does strongly support the Syrian Revolution, \\"with both its name and its mandate from the Free Syrian Legal Authority, a type of clearinghouse organization that proves the organization functions with the blessing of the Free Syrian Army‚Äî [which] is directly connected to the armed resistance against the Assad regime.\\" The university's mission statement is ‚Äúto prepare educated generations who seek to build a country of law and justice and institutions.‚Äù History The university's founder, Musab Al-Jamal, was a former law professor from Damascus University, Syria. He joined other faculty who were driven out from the war torn country to lecture students in liberated regions in the nation and neighboring countries. In 2012, Al-Jamal, along with several former classmates who attended Damascus University in the 1970s, fled for Turkey when the initially peaceful uprising descended into violence. It was then that Al-Jamal and his former classmates thought of establishing the Free Syrian University. Campus Offering a mix of both on-campus and online teaching, the campus is located in an apartment building in Reyhanli, a Turkish town near the Syrian border. Since much of the refugee population, including both students and faculty, still remains in Syria, the university offers lessons via Skype, Facebook and email. This is part of what the founder terms an \\"open-learning\\" approach. Organization and administration =Governance= The university has found support from professors among the Syrian diaspora living in Europe, who have offered to teach classes in Turkey and from abroad through the Internet. In total there are 32 professors in Reyhanli, and more than 60 throughout the world, all Syrian nationals. The university's curriculum is ‚Äúa combination of the old regime curriculum and new information from Sweden and Germany in particular.\\" It also includes English courses each semester. =Finances= The university is mainly funded by its founder and a host of academic volunteers donating their time and expertise to the cause. The founder gives them a one-time payment of $1,500 when they sign up. A modest fee structure is in place with students inside Syria charged $280 per semester and those outside $560. More than 90 percent of students are unable to pay anything and attend classes for free. Academics The university is organized into ten separate academic units (colleges) with the only campus in Reyhanli. The following colleges are: *College of Media *College of Law *College of International Relations and Diplomacy *College of Engineering *College of Education *College of Islamic sharia *College of Liberal Arts *College of Middle Eastern Studies *College of Business *College of Information Technology Enrollment The Free Syrian University has formally enrolled 870 students in Turkey and has hundreds more on digital mailing lists inside Syria and other neighboring countries, mostly in Jordan.

Usually named only as Alex, a Jewish prisoner from Greece, the photographer was a member of the Sonderkommando, inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers. Several sources identified him as Alberto Errera, a Greek naval officer.Gideon Greif, We Wept Without Tears: Testimonies of the Jewish Sonderkommando from Auschwitz, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005, 375, n. 2\\\\.

He took two shots from inside one of the gas chambers and two outside, shooting from the hip, unable to aim the camera with any precision. The Polish resistance smuggled the film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube. The photographs were numbered 280‚Äì283 by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.Dan Stone, \\"The Sonderkommando Photographs,\\" Jewish Social Studies, 7(3), Spring/Summer 2001, (132‚Äì148), 143, n. 3\\\\.

No. 282 shows a group of naked women just before they enter the gas chamber. No. 283 is an image of trees, the result of the photographer aiming too high.Didi-Huberman 2008, 117. Sonderkommando The Sonderkommando (\\"special commandos\\") in Auschwitz were mostly Jewish inmates, and at one point a few Russian prisoners-of-war, who were forced to work in the crematoria. The crematoria contained the Entkleidungskammer (undressing rooms), gas chambers and furnaces.Franciszek Piper, \\"Gas Chambers and Crematoria,\\" in Gutman and Berenbaum 1998 (157‚Äì178), 167‚Äì168. In the summer of 1944 the camp had up to 1,000 SonderkommandoDanuta Czech, \\"The Auschwitz Prisoner Administration,\\" in Yisrael Gutman, Michael Berenbaum (eds.), Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, Indiana University Press, 1998, 372. working in four crematoria (nos. II-V), and a bunker with extra gas chambers, housed in a thatched brick building known as the \\"little white house\\".Piper 1998, 161‚Äì168, 173‚Äì174. After inmates had been \\"selected\\" as unfit for work by the SS, the Sonderkommando usually took them to the undressing room, then walked them to the gas chamber, telling them they were being taken to the bathing and disinfection room.Greif 2005, 12‚Äì13, 134‚Äì135. To avoid panic, inmates were given a numbered hook for their belongings in the undressing room to make them believe they would be returning.Piper 1998, 173. Afterwards the Sonderkommando moved the bodies out of the gas chamber, removed gold fillings, false teeth, hair, jewellery and spectacles, and disposed of the corpses, at first in mass graves, and later in furnaces and fire pits. Then they cleaned the gas chamber for the next arrivals.Graif 2005, 5‚Äì8, 15‚Äì16, 321. Taking the photographs The photographer is usually named only as Alex, a Jewish inmate from Greece. Several sources have identified him as Alberto Errera, a Greek naval officer who was shot and killed after striking an SS officer.Dan Stone, History, Memory and Mass Atrocity, Vallentine Mitchell, 2006, 16.For Errera's details, Greif 2005, 375, n. 2\\\\.

Shlomo Venezia, Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, 90ff. Errera's code name was Alekos Alexandridis.Bowman 2009, 271. Other members of the Sonderkommando in the camp's crematorium V‚ÄîAlter Fajnzylberg (also known as Stanis≈Çaw Jankowski), brothers Shlomo and Josel Dragon, and David Szmulewski‚Äîhelped obtain and hide the camera, and acted as look- outs.Stone 2001, 132. Fajnzylberg, who had worked at crematorium V since July 1943,Jean-Claude Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1989, 124. described how the photographs came to be taken: > On the day on which the pictures were taken ... we allocated tasks. Some of > us were to guard the person taking the pictures. In other words, we were to > keep a careful watch for the approach of anyone who did not know the secret, > and above all for any SS men moving about in the area. At last the moment > came. We all gathered at the western entrance leading from the outside to > the gas-chamber of Crematorium V: we could not see any SS men in the > watchtower overlooking the door from the barbed wire, nor near the place > where the pictures were to be taken. Alex, the Greek Jew, quickly took out > his camera, pointed it towards a heap of burning bodies, and pressed the > shutter. This is why the photograph shows prisoners from the Sonderkommando > working at the heap. One of the SS was standing beside them, but his back > was turned towards the crematorium building. Another picture was taken from > the other side of the building, where women and men were undressing among > the trees. They were from a transport that was to be murdered in the gas- > chamber of Crematorium V.Janina Struk, Photographing the Holocaust: > Interpretations of the Evidence, I. B. Tauris, 2004, 114. Fajnzylberg recalled that the camera looked like a German Leica.Struk 2004, 115. Szmulewski had hidden it in a bucket, and stayed on the roof of the crematorium as a look-out while Alex shot the film.Didi-Huberman 2008, 16. Fajnzylberg stressed that, although Alex had pressed the shutter, all five men had been present and had acted together. According to Szmulewski, speaking in 1987 to Jean-Claude Pressac, the four photographs were taken within 15‚Äì30 minutes of each other. But according to director Christophe Cognet, the shorter shadows of the deportees in the birch woods, located to the south-east of the shooting, and the light of August, indicate that photos 283 and 282 were taken between 10 am and 11.30 am. The direction of the shadows in photos 280 and 281 of the cremation pits, taken in the West-South-West in relation to the shooting, and the August light, indicate that these photos were taken between 3 and 4 pm[french] Christophe Cognet, √âclats, Seuil, 2019 (), p. 313-314. Everything leads us to believe that it is the same transport photographed before and after the same gassingAt the beginning of August, two convoys arrived in Birkenau: convoy 26 left Mechelen on 31 July 1944 (28th and last convoy from Belgium) and arrived on 2 August; convoy 77 left Drancy on 31 July (last large convoy from France) and arrived on 3 August (Auschwitz Chronicles 1939-1945, Danuta Czech, pp. 678-679).. Taking into account the position of the trees in photo 282 compared to the aerial photos, and considering the testimony of Alter Fajnzylberg who reports that this photo, as well as photo 283, was taken from the inside, the historian Igor Bartosik puts forward the hypothesis that these photos were taken through the opening for pouring Zyklon B into the gas chamber, located at a height of 2 metres, given the large size of Errera[french] Christophe Cognet, √âclats, Seuil, 2019 (), p. 377-378. The black frame of the gas chamber's doorway or window, probably doorway, is visible in photographs 280 and 281.Pressac 1989, 424.. In photograph 281, a fragment of photograph 282 can be seen on the left, which means that the order in which the images were taken contradicts the numbering of the State Museum: the images of undressing in the birch woods precede the images of the cremation pits. The film was smuggled out of the camp by the Polish underground, hidden inside a tube of toothpaste by Helena Dant√≥n, who worked in the SS canteen. A note dated 4 September 1944 and signed Stak≈Ço, written by political prisoners J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz and Stanis≈Çaw K≈Çodzi≈Ñski, was attached to the film. It asked that the photographs be sent to \\"Tell\\", Teresa ≈Åasocka-Estreicher of the underground in Krak√≥w:Stone 2001, 148, n. 48. > Urgent. Send two metal rolls of film for 6x9 as fast as possible. Have > possibility of taking photos. Sending you photos of Birkenau showing > prisoners sent to gas chambers.

Send > film roll as fast as you can. Send the enclosed photos to Tell‚Äîwe think > enlargements of the photos can be sent further.Didi-Huberman 2008, 16‚Äì17. Originals When the photographs were first distributed by the Polish resistance, they were cropped to focus on the figures, with the black frames in the two fire-pit images removed. Photography historian Janina Struk writes that Teresa ≈Åasocka-Estreicher (\\"Tell\\" in the note from the camp) asked Polish photographer to make prints, and it is assumed that it was Mucha who decided to crop them.Struk 2004, 118. Some of the cropped images were published in 1945, attributed to the Sonderkommando member David Szmulewski, in a report on Auschwitz-Birkenau by Jan Sehn, a Polish judge.Pressac 1989, 422. One was exhibited at Auschwitz in 1947, and others were published in 1958 in Warsaw in a book by Stanis≈Çaw Wrzos-Glinka, Tadeusz Mazur and Jerzy Tomaszewski, 1939‚Äì1945: Cierpienie i walka narodu polskiego (published in English as 1939‚Äì1945: We Have Not Forgotten). Some of the figures had been retouched to make them clearer. Struk writes that, in 1960, W≈Çadyslaw Pytlik of the resistance movement in Brzeszcze offered testimony about his wartime experiences to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, and brought along three prints of the cropped photographs.Struk 2004, 117. It was only in 1985, after Pytlik died and his wife donated his photographs to the museum, including the uncropped versions, that the museum realized the prints they had seen before had been cropped. Commentators have argued that the cropping offers a distorted view of events, giving the impression that the photographer was able to use his camera openly. In fact he and the rest of the group placed themselves in great danger by taking the shots; in two of them, 282 and 283, it is clear that he was not even able to look through the lens.Reiniger (Yad Vashem). The art historian Georges Didi-Huberman argues that the cropping makes the photographs appear safe and erases the act of resistance and the phenomenology of the images, the process that \\"made them an event\\": > The mass of black that surrounds the sight of the cadavers and the pits, > this mass where nothing is visible gives in reality a visual mark that is > just as valuable as all the rest of the exposed surface. That mass where > nothing is visible is the space of the gas chamber: the dark room into which > one had to retreat, to step back, in order to give light to the work of the > Sonderkommando outside, above the pyres. That mass of black gives us the > situation itself, the space of possibility, the condition of existence of > the photographs themselves.Didi-Huberman 2008, 35‚Äì36.

Overview The Sonatine for Flute and Piano is one of a series of four test pieces for the Paris Conservatoire that Dutilleux wrote between 1942 and 1951. They were commissioned by then-director Claude Delvincourt. These pieces were intended both to test the technique of the students and provide them with new scores.https://betweentheledgerlines.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/remembering- henri-dutilleux-1916-2013/ Dutilleux was notoriously critical of his early works, including the Sonatine. He once stated that he had never been completely happy that it was played so often but he never withdrew it. The work has become a standard of the flute repertoire and has been performed many times by flautists such as Sharon Bezaly and Emmanuel Pahud. As of 2014, it is Dutilleux's most often recorded work.http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Henri-Dutilleux/Composer/3305-1 Music The sonatine is structured in 3 sections played without a break.http://www.eclassical.com/shop/17115/art10/4940010-9eda5e-809730512629.pdf The first section features a mysterious theme in contrasting with jagged piano figures.

It is the only surviving element of the hostelry, the rest of which was destroyed by fire in 1927. This structure originally housed only sleeping and common lounge spaces, but was modified after the fire to have a kitchen, and continued to be operated as a summer hostel by Dike until her death in 1937. It continues to be used as a guest lodging facility by its present owners. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gable roof. An engaged porch wraps around three sides of the building, and the front roof facade is pierced by three shed-roof dormers. The second floor of the front elevation has five sash windows, while the first floor has an asymmetrical recessed face with its entry slightly less recessed than the surrounding exterior walls. The porch, under the overhanging second floor, is supported by chamfered square posts. The kitchen ell is a two-story structure extending to the rear of the main block.

The abbey was a Cistercian convent founded near Beauvais in 1217 and moved to its current site in Paris in 1672 at the behest of Louis XIV. A reconstruction of the abbey was initiated in 1745 by the Abbess Marie-Catherine B√©thisy de M√©zi√®res and work was completed in 1783. In the late 18th century the abbey was one of the most prestigious educational institutions in Paris for daughters of the elite, including two of Thomas Jefferson's. The abbey also provided rooms for ladies of good standing who were in search of rest, including Jos√©phine de Beauharnais when the case of her separation from her first husband was heard. The abbey was disestablished during the French Revolution and the buildings were turned over to military use, first as the home of the National Guard, then the Imperial Guard, and later the Cent-gardes. It continues to be occupied by the Minist√®re de la D√©fense with the exception of the former chapel, which since 1844 has been a Protestant church, the Temple de Pentemont. In August 2014 the Ministry of Defence, facing budget cuts due to austerity policies, sold the buildings to a real estate investment trust, Fonci√®re des 6√®me et 7√®me Arrondissements de Paris, with plans to move all ministry offices out of the abbey by the end of October, 2016. History =Beauvais (1217‚Äì1672)= Philip of Dreux, the famed crusader bishop of Beauvais, wished to found a convent of the Cistercian order. In 1217 he set aside an orchard southwest of Beauvais, on which were traced out the plans for construction, as well as seven arpents (6-7 acres) of vines. Philip died before the project was completed and his successor, Bishop Milo of Nanteuil, raised the rest of the funds, and it was completed in 1218. Pope Gregory IX issued a bull from the Lateran Palace on the 8 June 1230 which sanctioned the new abbey and declared the funds raised for its endowment protected. The abbey took its name, meaning mountain slope, from its location at the foot of the Montagne de St-Symphorien. In 1554 the abbey provided refuge to Charlotte I de Monceaux, the abbess of the neighboring Abbey of Saint-Paul, whose election as abbess was opposed by Henry II. She fled to Pentemont after the arrival of the king's soldiers at her own abbey. However, they followed her to Pentemont and demanded by force that she renounce her position, a request to which she was compelled to accede. In 1671, after the abbey was damaged in a flood, and for economic and geographical reasons, the abbess H√©l√®ne de Tourville moved the abbey to Paris. At the time, the convent had twelve sisters. The previous building was demolished and returned to agricultural work as part of the Pentemont farm. =Paris (1672‚Äì1790)= The unsuccessful proposal by Fran√ßois II Franque for the rebuilt Pentemont Abbey, as found in the Encyclop√©die In Paris the abbey took up residence in a former convent, recently suppressed, of the Sisters of the Incarnate Word, located on Rue de Grenelle at the current site of the abbey. The sisters dedicated themselves to the education of young women and later added rooms in which women of good standing could find rest. The abbey quickly acquired a distinguished reputation and by the time of its dissolution in 1790 had revenues of 58,000 livres, a great sum for the era. The final abbess, Marie III Catherine de B√©thisy de M√©zi√®res, spent 45 years and a great deal of money rebuilding and expanding the abbey. A competition for plans for a reconstruction attracted multiple proposals including one from the royal architect, Fran√ßois II Franque, which drew praise from Denis Diderot in the Encyclop√©die for its combination of grandeur and simplicity. The winning proposal, however, was from Pierre Contant d'Ivry. The many famous students educated at the abbey included the noted abbess and princess Louise Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon,Louis Chaigne, Les B√©n√©dictines de la rue Monsieur, F.-X. Le Roux editions, Strasbourg-Paris, 1950, p. 13 sqq and Louise d'Esparb√®s de Lussan, the mistress of the Count of Artois, the future Charles X of France. Thomas Jefferson's daughters Martha and Mary were both educated at the Pentemont Abbey while he was Minister to France. Their entry into the school was sponsored by the wife of the Marquis de Lafayette. The future first lady Abigail Adams was shocked that Jefferson would send his girls to a Catholic school but he assured her that there were many Protestants at the abbey. Conditions were austere for the students, despite the presence of three princesses, with no fires until the water froze and a prohibition on speaking outside of class and recreation. Her time at the school led Martha, nicknamed Patsy, to write a letter to her father expressing her desire to become a nun. Jefferson quickly removed his daughters from the care of the convent. The abbey also provided elegant apartments to highborn women seeking independence from families or difficult marriages. The ladies were free to come and go as they liked, with constraints on the hours allowed outside the convent, often had their children and servants with them, and spent their evenings socializing and commiserating in the abbey's salons. One such resident was Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, the future Empress of France, during her separation from her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais. The court granted her temporary independence from her husband and required her to stay at Pentemont with her children at the expense of Alexandre. It is also speculated that James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institution, who was born in Paris the illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland, was born in the Pentemont Abbey, as it had strong connections to the Duke, whose illegitimate daughters it educated. =State Property (1790‚Äì2015)= A grenadier of the Imperial Guard, which was headquartered at Pentemont Abbey Military During the French Revolution, the Abbey was suppressed and its properties confiscated. The abbey's affairs were wound down in 1791-2, with its properties in Beauvais sold to pay off state debt. With the abbey now state property it came to serve first as home to the National Guard, then the Imperial Guard. In 1835, the building was expanded to Rue de Bellechasse which required the demolition of some parts of the original structure. Under the Second Empire the abbey served as the barracks of the Cent-gardes Squadron, an elite cavalry unit that provided personal protection for Napoleon III and the Tuileries Palace. In the twentieth century, Pentemont Abbey housed the Ministry of War Pensions, Bonuses and Benefits. In 1937, a bunker was constructed underneath the Court of Honor including two stationary bicycles intended to provide electricity in case of power loss due to enemy bombardment. The courtyard has a war memorial that reads \\"From veterans to their comrades who gave their lives for their country. In memoriam.\\" It is also home to a number of commemorative plaques, including ones for Andr√© Maginot and Henri Frenay. Protestant Church The chapel was used to store grain during the Revolution and later hay when the army took over the abbey. After the Concordat of 1801 provided formal recognition of the Reformed Church in France, it was decided that three former Catholic churches in Paris be turned over to Reformed congregations, Saint-Louis-du-Louvre, Sainte-Marie- des-Anges, and the chapel of the Pentemont Abbey. In 1598, Protestant worship had been forbidden in Paris by the Edict of Nantes. In 1685, the Edict of Fontainebleau made non-Catholic services illegal in all of France. This inaugurated a long period of persecution for French Protestants though some in Paris were able to worship in the chapels of the Dutch and Swedish embassies. The handover of the chapel of the abbey as well as the other churches ushered in a new era of open Protestant worship in Paris. The actual opening of the former abbey as a Reformed congregation was delayed by decades of bureaucratic obstacles as well as opposition during the Bourbon Restoration to turning over a former Catholic building to Protestant use. It was not until 1844 that architect Victor Baltard began work to convert the chapel into a Protestant church. He isolated the chapel from the rest of the building, added new doors in place of two of the previous windows, and converted the former choir to a nave. He also closed off the original entrance by adding a massive organ, built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll and installed in 1846 for the opening of the church. The organ has undergone various modifications over the years including a restoration from 2011-14 to restore the remaining original elements. The church itself underwent restoration from 2005-2007 commissioned by the City of Paris and accomplished by Benjamin Mouton, the chief architect of historic monuments, and the firm Aubert-Labansat.

This was in contrast to the larger scale, and highly mechanized \\"water-sale\\" collieries exporting coal by sea and later canal to southern England. Land- sale coal was free of tax, and so coal users in coal producing areas could obtain coal free of duties for \\"water-sale coal\\" shipped by sea or canal, such as duties paid at the ports of London.Thomas Southcliffe Ashton, Joseph Sykes The Coal Industry of the Eighteenth Century 1929 p.248 \\"Land-sale coal was free of tax, and so the regions about the coalfields were given advantages over and above those conferred upon them by nature. London was specially burdened, for the duties there were higher than at most other ports.\\" The smaller local \\"land-sale\\" collieries were less productive, but also had lower costs as they paid lower wages to miners, or were rented by self-employed tenants.J. U. Nef The Rise of the British Coal Industry 1136235361 2013 p.184 \\"It is probable that the miners ordinarily worked fewer days in the coal fields where colliery enterprise was most advanced, and where their daily or weekly wages were normally highest, than in the backward mining districts, where coal was produced for local ‚Äú land-sale ‚Äù. While winter weather affected all mines the smaller land sale collieries were more prone to lying idle. In the unusual case of the Wear Valley and South Durham land-sale miners were able to seasonally migrate to work on bigger water-sale collieries during part of the winter.J. U. Nef The Rise of the British Coal Industry 1136235361 2013 p.184 The conditions of work in the Wear valley and in south Durham, which permitted miners to migrate from the ‚Äú land-sale ‚Äù to the ‚Äú sea-sale \\" pits during that part of the year when the former were usually idle, could not have prevailed in many other regions.\\" The landsale tenement system involved the renting out of coal rights on land to smallholders to operate mines for rent. In Decisions of the Court of King's Bench 1793 it was stated that a \\"land sale colliery\\" was a \\"term well known in the coal mining areas\\" and understood as including not only the rental or tenement on the land to be mined, but also the required stock of horses, gins, ropes, and other things necessary for working the mine.Decisions of the Court of King's Bench 1793 \\"a \\"land sale colliery\\" being a term well known in the coal countries as comprehending not the mine only, but the stock of horses, gins, ropes, and other things necessary for working,\\" Though whether the rent on the horses and gins were included was disputed in at least one case.Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of the King's Bench John Leycester Adolphus, Thomas Flower Ellis - 1836 \\"In Rex v.

The western kingdom successfully fended off the Taungoo invasions, and kept its independence. The war had a deterrence effect: Mrauk U would not see another Taungoo invasion until 1580. The war's origins can be traced back to 1542 when King Min Bin of Mrauk U provided military support on the side of the Kingdom of Ava in the Taungoo‚ÄìAva War (1538‚Äì45). Although Min Bin left the alliance in the same year, King Tabinshwehti of Taungoo was determined to repay the favor. In 1545, Tabinshwehti agreed to aid Min Aung Hla, the former Viceroy of Thandwe, who had been removed from office by Min Bin. In October 1545, Tabinshwehti sent a 4000-strong army but it was promptly driven back. A much larger naval and land forces (combined 19,000 troops) of Taungoo tried again in the following dry season. The invasion forces overran southern Arakan, and were about to breach the defenses of the capital of Mrauk U when Mrauk U forces opened the sluices of the city's reservoirs, flooding the invaders out. On 30 January 1547, the two sides agreed to a peace treaty that allowed an orderly withdrawal of Taungoo forces from Arakan. The uneasy peace would last for the next 33 years. Background Taungoo-ruled territory in 1545 In the early 16th century, the present-day Myanmar comprised several small kingdoms. The two traditional powers that had dominated the Irrawaddy valley since the 14th century, the Kingdom of Ava (Inwa) and Hanthawaddy Kingdom, were in serious decline. By the 1530s, the old powers had been or were being eclipsed by upstart powers. In Upper Burma, the Mohnyin-led Confederation of Shan States finally finished off Ava in 1527.Harvey 1925: 106 On the western coast, the Kingdom of Mrauk U was ascendant at the expense of a weak Bengal, extending its reach into the Ganges Delta in 1533.Harvey 1925: 140Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 38‚Äì39 In the south, In the south, Taungoo defeated Pegu in 1538‚Äì39, and Martaban in 1541, giving the men from the small frontier outpost total control of Lower Burma.Harvey 1925: 154‚Äì157 Taungoo's meteoric rise raised alarm amongst other powers. In 1539, Ava (now part of the Confederation) and Mrauk U entered into an alliance to defend Ava's vassal state of Prome.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 195 But their poorly coordinated forces could not stop better organized Taungoo forces from taking over Prome (Pyay) in 1542. After his army's crushing defeat at Padaung Pass, King Min Bin of Mrauk U left the alliance. Convinced that Taungoo's guns would eventually point toward his kingdom, Min Bin beefed up the already formidable defenses around his capital.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 30 In the following three years, Taungoo completed its takeover of central Burma up to Bagan, which Ava formally ceded in exchange for peace in 1545.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 148‚Äì149 King Tabinshwehti had now built the largest polity in Burma since the fall of the Pagan Empire in 1287.Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 130‚Äì132Lieberman 2003: 151 But as his upcoming campaigns in Arakan (1545‚Äì47) and Thailand (1547‚Äì49) show he was still intent on expanding elsewhere. Prelude Burmese and Arakanese chronicles give differing accounts of the events leading to the war. The Burmese chronicles Maha Yazawin and Hmannan Yazawin give Mrauk U's prior involvement in the Ava‚ÄìTaungoo war as the main reason for the warMaha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 178Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 233‚Äì234 while Arakanese chronicles are completely silent on Mrauk U's role in the Ava‚ÄìTaungoo war. Furthermore, the Burmese chronicles say that Tabinshwehti invaded at the invitation of the viceroy of Thandwe, who had lost the Arakanese throne to his nephew following the death of the Arakanese king in 1545.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 173 All major Arakanese chronicles agree that the Arakanese king had not died, and that the king appointed his son as viceroy of Thandwe, replacing his brother, at some point during his reign. But they disagree as to when the replacement took place, and whether the deposed viceroy remained loyal to Min Bin afterwards. Dhanyawaddy Ayedawbon says that the king replaced his brother with one of his sons as viceroy of Thandwe, and his brother subsequently sought help from Taungoo.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 41 Rakhine Razawin Haung and Maha Razawin (Saya Me) too say that the king appointed his son Prince Upayaza viceroy at an unidentified date but suggest that his brother Min Aung Hla remained loyal and was still the viceroy during the Taungoo invasions. But they never mention when and why Min Aung Hla lost his office afterwards.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 30, 35 In all, it appears that in 1545 Min Aung Hla lost (or sensed that he was about to lose) his office to his nephew, and sought help from Tabinshwehti.While Arakanese chronicles are silent on the reason for the removal, Min Bin may have decided to remove Min Aung Hla for the latter's disastrous defeat at Padaung Pass in 1542. Tabinshwehti was certainly interested in repaying the favor. He led a highly experienced and well equipped military, riding high after a string of victories. His high command had been joined by former Hanthawaddy generals like Saw Lagun Ein and Smim Payu, and Portuguese mercenaries like Diogo Soares.Harvey 1925: 154‚Äì158 Nonetheless, Tabinshwehti was not yet ready to start another full-scale war, given the developing situation in Upper Burma where Ava was facing a serious rebellion backed by Mohnyin. A Mohnyin victory over Ava would have voided the treaty, and Taungoo's new northern border could again be contested.(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 148‚Äì149): The leader of the rebellion Sithu Kyawhtin was the former governor of Salin, now part of Tabinshwehti's empire, and the Ava commander of the failed raid of Salin in 1544‚Äì45. Still, the infighting in Arakan was too good an opportunity to pass up. The king sent four regiments (4000 troops, 1000 horses, 100 elephants), led by Sit Tuyingathu, Smim Enaye, Smim Byatsa, and Smim Mawkhwin, to assist the viceroy of Thandwe. First campaign (1545) At Mrauk U, Min Bin had expected the move. On 12 October 1545, he sent six army and naval regiments to Thandwe.Arakanese chronicles do not agree on the date of the start of the war. Razawin Haung and Maha Razawin (Saya Me) chronicles (Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 32‚Äì35) say that the invasion occurred in 906 ME (29 March 1544 to 29 March 1545), and/or Monday, 8th waxing of Tazaungmon 907 ME (12 October 1545). Dhanyawaddy Ayedawbon (Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 41) says the invasion began in 905 ME (30 March 1543 to 29 March 1544) during the reign of King Min Phalaung, which is rejected by Rakhine Razawin Thit chronicle. The standard Burmese chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 173) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 227) say that the war began in 907 ME (30 March 1545 to 29 March 1546). The Arakanese naval and land forces now included Portuguese mercenaries and their state-of-the-art firearms.James 2004: 171 The Royal Arakanese Navy was considered the best in the region, and was well regarded even by the Portuguese pirates.Harvey 1925: 140‚Äì141 Min Bin's forces went on to drive out Min Aung Hla and his men from Thandwe before the four Taungoo regiments arrived. When the Taungoo forces did arrive, they were surprised to learn that the city had been taken over by the Mrauk U forces. Unprepared to take the heavily fortified city with their 4000 men, the Taungoo command decided to retreat. The Burmese chronicles do not say that they even attempted to take the city but the Arakanese chronicles say the city's musket, mortar, and artillery fire drove back the invaders. Still according to the Arakanese chronicles, the Mrauk U forces followed up on the retreating Taungoo forces to the border, engaging them in several skirmishes in which many Taungoo troops were killed or taken prisoner. The Taungoo regiments were on the verge of being wiped out when Taungoo reinforcements arrived in time to break the encirclement, and retreat in good order. Min Aung Hla and his followers also made it to mainland Burma. For the Taungoo high command, the campaign had been a disaster. But given the still fluid situation in Upper Burma, they decided to hold off further incursions in the remaining dry season. Tabinshwehti promised Min Aung Hla that he would put the former viceroy in his rightful place. Second campaign (1546‚Äì47) =Preparations= By mid-1546, the war in Upper Burma had reached a stalemate with the rump Ava Kingdom further splitting into two halves: the Mohnyin-controlled west of the Irrawaddy (present-day Sagaing Region and southern Kachin State), and Onbaung‚ÄìHsipaw- controlled eastern half (approximately, northern Mandalay Region and western Shan State).Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 149‚Äì151 The Taungoo command cautiously decided that it was safe to launch a major campaign in Arakan in the following dry season. By October 1546, they had raised a sizable invasion force (19,000 men, 400 horses, 60 elephants) as well as a number of rearguard forces. Because of the challenging terrain of the Arakan Mountains, only 4000 men would invade by land from the Irrawaddy delta. Instead, over three quarters of the invasion forces (15,000 men) would be transported by sea using 800 war boats, 500 armored war boats, and 100 cargo boats. Taungoo now possessed a serious navy, mostly made up of ethnic Mon troops and commanded by former Hanthawaddy lords.Harvey 1925: 158 The land army was commanded by Nanda Thingyan and Baya Nandathu. Meanwhile, a number of rearguard forces were deployed across the kingdom: the capital Hanthawaddy was defended by regiments commanded by Baya Gamani and Binnya Ein; the southern province of Martaban (present-day Mon State) by Saw Binnya U of Mawlamyine; Taungoo in east-central Burma by Mingyi Swe; Pyay in west-central Burma by Thado Dhamma Yaza I of Prome; and key towns along the northern border, Bagan, Salay, and Taungdwingyi by their local governors. On the opposing side, the Arakanese kingdom's defenses were well prepared. The capital city of Mrauk U was protected by an extensive network of defensive structures. It was ringed by eleven forts,(Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 30‚Äì31): The forts were: starting from east in clockwise direction, Yan Aung, Thanlyin, Mya Taung, Kala, Thaya, Ta- Let Taung, Peinne Taung, Nat Taung (northwest from Mrauk U), Shan Taung (northeast), Ingyin Taung, Kya-Khot Taung. each of which was reinforced with walls, moats, trenches, and lakes. Canals were also set up to interconnect the ring forts. The capital itself was surrounded by a trench, three tiers of moats, and a stone wall with an extensive network of bastions atop the wall. Diversionary canals and lakes ensured the city's water supply in case of a long siege.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 30‚Äì31 These were the result of the multi-year defensive construction works project Min Bin launched right after his conquest of Bengal in 1533. The defense works were initially begun to protect the capital region from rampant seaborne raids by Portuguese pirates, and later expanded to defend against Taungoo invasions.(Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 30‚Äì31): Min Bin started the program in 1533/34 (905 ME) after hearing that Tabinshwehti had conquered all of Hanthawaddy and all of Myanmar, and reasoning that he would be next. But in 1533/34, Tabinshwehti had not started any wars; his first campaign came in late 1534. At the start of the campaign, the capital region was defended by no less than 20,000 troops. A 35-ship Arakanese fleet, largely manned by Portuguese mercenaries and commanded by Min Dikkha, sailed down to Cape Negrais to block a possible seaborne invasion. =Start of invasion= 1546‚Äì47 campaign On 28 October 1546, Taungoo naval and land forces began the campaign.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 175) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 229) say the campaign began on Monday, 4th waxing of Tazaungmon 908 ME but the date translates to Thursday, 28 October 1546. The Taungoo high command, including Tabinshwehti, traveled by sea.(Harvey 1925: 158) says Bayinnaung marched with the army. But the chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 228‚Äì229) say that the army was commanded by Nanda Thingyan and Baya Nandathu, and that Bayinnaung assumed command only when the army was in southern Arakan. The Mrauk U navy, waiting around Cape Negrais, initially thought about engaging Taungoo vanguard squadrons but decided against it when they saw the size of the invasion fleet.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 175 The fleet sailed up the Arakan coast unopposed, and dropped off troops south of Thandwe. They joined up with the army that had just crossed over the Arakan Mountains. Bayinnaung now assumed command of the combined armies. Then Taungoo land and naval forces converged on Thandwe. The Mrauk U navy defended the port but was defeated by sheer numbers. Mrauk U land forces evacuated Thandwe. Tabinshwehti appointed Min Aung Hla as the viceroy of Thandwe, and left Nanda Kyawhtin, Governor of Thanlyin, in charge of the city's defenses.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 230 =Battle of Mrauk U= By January 1547, Taungoo land and naval forces had left Thandwe for Mrauk U. The Arakanese defenses now awaited from their capital defense zone. A 5000-strong elite army, equipped with foreign firearms, defended the capital while another 15,000 troops were posted at forts around the capital. By the second half of January, Taungoo forces converged onto the capital region. Invasion armies approached from the southeast while another army and war boats entered the Kaladan River from the southwest. Arakanese defenses successfully drove back the seaborne invasion force near Po-Chi Island. But they could not stop the Taungoo army at Launggyet, which fell on 23 January 1547.(Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 42): 2nd waxing of Tabodwe 908 ME = 23 January 1547 Tabinshwehti did not pause. Taungoo troops began their final push the very next day. They overcame Arakanese defenses, and breached the eastern outworks of Mrauk U. But Min Bin opened the sluices of the city's reservoirs, flooding out many Taungoo troops and creating an impassable moat. Taungoo forces were now reduced to shelling from afar. But their Portuguese supplied cannon had little effect against Mrauk U's stone walls.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 230 The Taungoo forces were again in for a long siege. Although the Taungoo forces had successfully sacked other fortified cities after long sieges (Martaban in 1540‚Äì41, Prome in 1541‚Äì42), the Taungoo high command realized overcoming Mrauk U's elaborate defenses in four months before the rainy season would be difficult. Further complicating matters, Tabinshwehti received news that Siamese forces had occupied Dawei, which Taungoo had claimed.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238 The Upper Tenasserim peninsula was defended by the garrison at Moulmein but the Taungoo command was nonetheless concerned. They advised against a long siege, warning that it would be extremely difficult to get back to Lower Burma during the monsoon season since the troops could not use the sea, and would have to pass the Arakan Yoma range, a difficult proposition even in the dry season. Given that the home country was still vulnerable to possible external attacks, they advised the king to accept a compromise with Min Bin.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 232‚Äì233 Likewise, Min Bin may have wanted a quick truce since he had heard that Tripuri marauders were raiding his northern possessions in Bengal down to Ramu.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 33 =Negotiations= Burmese and Arakanese chronicles disagree as to which side began the offer for negotiations. The Burmese chronicles say that a few days after the siege, the Mrauk U court sent four monks with a peace proposal.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 231 The Arakanese chronicles however say that Taungoo proposed first, stating that Min Bin at first refused to see Tabinshwehti's emissary Bayinnaung, and agreed to see him only on the second day.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 42‚Äì43 The negotiations went on for a few days. The Burmese chronicles say that Min Bin agreed to restore Min Aung Hla as the viceroy of Thandwe and seven southern townships in exchange for peace, and that the two kings exchanged gifts, including two war ships by Tabinshwehti.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 237‚Äì238 But the Arakanese chronicles say only that Tabinshwehti presented lavish gifts to Min Bin before retreating.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 45 At any rate, the two sides reached agreement on 30 January 1547, allowing an orderly withdrawal of Taungoo forces.(Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2 1999: 45) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238): 9th waxing of Tabodwe 908 ME = 30 January 1547 Taungoo forces withdrew from Mrauk U beginning on 2 February 1547, but two regiments remained stationed at Thandwe for three more months per agreement.(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238): 12th waxing of Tabodwe 908 ME = 2 February 1547 Aftermath Both kingdoms went on to deal with respective intrusions. Min Bin immediately sent troops to drive Tripuri raiders out of East Bengal. Tabinshwehti waited until the next dry season (November 1547) before ordering his troops to drive out the Siamese from Tavoy.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238‚Äì239 Emboldened by success, he invaded Siam in 1548 and again went on to lay siege to Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya. As in Mrauk U, Taungoo forces could not break through and had to retreat in 1549. Despite the peace agreement, Mrauk U and Hanthawaddy remained wary of each other. Bayinnaung readily took in Prince Upayaza of Thandwe, who had lost the throne to Min Dikkha, awarded him the style Thiri Dhammathawka in 1554, and married him to one of his nieces.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 215 Legacy The war not only preserved Arakan's independence but also had a long deterrence effect. Although Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung had experienced failed campaigns before (against Hanthawaddy during 1534‚Äì37), this campaign was different. Mrauk U's defenses so impressed the Taungoo military leadership that they would not attempt to conquer the western kingdom again until 1580,Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 71 only after they had conquered much farther away lands.(Lieberman 2003: 152): \\"Hanthawaddy now exercised suzerainty from Manipur to the marches of Cambodia and from the borders of Arakan to Yunnan. Notwithstanding its fragility, this was probably the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia.\\" The 1580‚Äì81 invasion of Arakan was the last campaign ordered by Bayinnaung.

She graduated in 1988 with a Ph.D. in the Department of Biochemistry under the advisor Dr. Howard K. Schachman. Her dissertation was titled \\"Site-Directed Mutations Altering the Active Site and the Nucleotide-Binding Site of Aspartate Transcarbamoylase.\\" Career During her time at the University of Iowa (1980 - 1984), Wente worked as a research technician under F. Jeffery Field in the Lipid Research Core Laboratory at the University of Iowa College of Medicine. She was a student research collaborator with Marshall Elzinga in the Department of Biology at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. Wente also completed her undergraduate thesis studies under the direction of Alice B. Fulton in the Department of Biochemistry. She became a teaching assistant in the Department of Biochemistry while at the University of California, Berkeley. Wente taught a biochemistry laboratory course the summer after obtaining her Ph.D. Wente engaged in a molecular biology postdoctoral fellowship with Ora Rosen at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City from 1988 - 1989. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship with G√ºnter Blobel at the Laboratory of Cell Biology at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Rockefeller University in New York City from 1989 - 1993. She received a Beckman Young Investigators Award in 1996. Wente became an assistant professor of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri in 1993 and associate professor in 1998. She began working at Vanderbilt in 2002 as the department chair and professor of cell and developmental biology. In December 2008, she became an assistant vice chancellor for research at Vanderbilt.

She previously served on the editorial board of Traffic (2004-2014) and Molecular and Cellular Biology (1999-2013). Current research Wente's current research focuses on the cell's adaptability to changing environmental conditions. She focuses on the exchange of large molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. She focuses mostly on the border of this exchange, called the NPC. Wente's work targets three specific questions: :# How the NPC is created from its composition and how this affects the way genes are expressed :# How the movement through the NPCs is regulated :# How other factors associated with NPCs play a role in other steps of gene expression To view the cells and perform her studies, Wente uses yeast and fluorescent imaging. She studies these cells by examining interactions between the NPCs and its receptors for imported and exported material. She further studies the NPCs by observing its supporting proteins and determining the functions of these proteins. In doing so, she can test different hypotheses and figure out how these proteins could potentially malfunction and lead to various disease pathologies. Awards Wente has been the recipient of numerous awards throughout her career. In 1984, she was awarded the Susan B. Hancher Award, recognizing her leadership as a senior at the University of Iowa and the Sanxay Prize, a token of promising graduate studies.

Stuit Honors Award, 1982 Iowa Forensic League Hugh F. Seabury Award, 1980 Selected publications Below is a list of selected publications of Wente's in chronological order. Wente discusses the export of mRNPs through NPCs and the different requirements for this to occur. The article discusses the different functional domains and receptors required for this transport to occur. It provides evidence that these factors directly affect FG domain function and mRNA export. Soluble inositides are studied as possible second eukaryotic messengers. It is discovered that these inositides play a role in gene expression at various levels. The article suggests that the cell produces these inositides in localized areas in order to create quick signals within the body. The article also contains information regarding the way the cell responds to changing environments caused by extracellular stimuli which affect gene expression. Wente and her colleagues discuss the overall function of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). They discuss that NPCs are the only known means of exchange for materials between the nucleus and cytoplasm. They discuss the different types of nucleus to cytoplasm transport. They conclude that proper NPC development is essential for physiological functioning, which if damaged, could cause improper cell division. The article focuses largely on the issues surrounding the topic of NPC assembly and functioning. Wente and her colleagues provide the first evidence that the Ran GTPase cycle is essential in order to build the nuclear pore complex (NPC). They identified the different necessities to assemble NPCs using genetic information from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They introduced mutant Ran factors and found that it caused nucleoporins and a poremembrane protein to be mislocalized. This caused disturbances in the membrane, so they were able to conclude that Ran mediation is required for proper NPC assembly. This article was Wente's first publication as the sole author. She discusses how nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the location for the entrance and exit of the nucleus. She defines the transport machinery for movement within the cell and gives future direction that researchers may now examine the interactions between shuttling transport factors and the static pore complex. This article also focuses on the protein transport in and out of the nucleus. In this article, Wente and her colleagues discuss the vast number of signal types, receptors, and proteins and how this suggests that there are many pathways for entrance to and exit from the nucleus. The mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport is also explained. Wente and her colleagues investigated the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase and the amino acid residues that assist in making it a catalyst. They found that Lys-84 is essential in order for the enzyme to be catalyst and that replacement of any of this residue would cause the enzyme to essentially become inactive.

Since the Prussians lacked siege cannons, they tried to starve the French defenders into surrender by blockading the city. In late December, the French Army of the Moselle under Lazare Hoche and Army of the Rhine under Jean-Charles Pichegru defeated the Coalition armies opposed to them, forcing the Prussians to raise the War of the First Coalition siege. Almost two months after Landau was surrounded, the Coalition army won a victory in the First Battle of Wissembourg, driving the Army of the Rhine deep into Alsace. The French government placed a priority on relieving Landau, so Pichegru's army began a sustained offensive against Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Coalition army in the Battle of Haguenau. The effort finally succeeded when Hoche's army outflanked Wurmser in the Battle of Froeschwiller and then the combined French armies won the Second Battle of Wissembourg over Wurmser and Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in late December.

Founded on October 1, 1952, it has since 2000 been owned by the Beijing Daily Group, which also runs eight other newspapers. It has a circulation of about 400,000 per day, making it one of the most widely circulated newspapers in the city. History When the People's Liberation Army occupied Beijing, the of the Beijing Party Committee was Beiping Jiefang Bao (Beiping Liberation News), but this soon ceased publication because many journalists had to move southward with the army. The committee felt it was necessary to create a new party newspaper, so preparatory work started in March 1951. In 1952, Fan Jin came from Tianjin, and was appointed as the director of the Beijing Daily preparatory group. On October 1 of the same year, publication of Beijing Daily started. The paper's header was inscribed by Mao Zedong. The Inaugural Issue was drafted by Liao Mosha, then Head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Beijing Committee, and edited by Mayor Peng Zhen. When its publication started, it lacked articles to receive, many contents were identical to those in People's Daily. At a conference held on October 16, Peng Zhen advocated to publish shorter and more local articles. Shortly afterwards, a labor strike broke out, Beijing Daily fought a successful propaganda campaign. From then, the newspaper became popular among workers in Beijing. From 1963 to 1966, the newspaper did not cooperate with the Gang of Four. It refused to reprint Yao Wenyuan's criticism of Hai Rui Dismissed from Office. For that reason it was criticized as an \\"anti-party instrument\\" by the Guangming Daily and People's Liberation Army Daily on May 8, 1966. Then CPC Central Committee North China Bureau sent a work group to the newspaper office, reorganized the editorial board. On September 3, 1966, it was forced to cease publication. On March 17, 1967, the headquarters of PLA Beijing garrison declared military control of the newspaper office, many staff members were criticized and denounced. In April of the same year its publication resumed. During the Cultural Revolution, Beijing Daily, along with other local newspapers, followed the leftist policy of Mao, made propaganda reports on \\"typical paths\\" of socialist construction. In the following years, the Military Control Commission, Military Propaganda Team, Labour's Propaganda Team were removed. In August 1972, a new leading board was formed. After 1976, they began to deal with the remaining problems of Cultural Revolution. On January 1, 1991, laser typesetting system was first introduced. In January 2001, they built a new printing center, the main factory building has an area of 30000 square meters. In October 2012, a new news editing center of 40000 square meters architectural area was built. Content The newspaper is now published in 16 pages. It reports on international, domestic and local news as well as economy, society, culture and sports in Beijing. There are 4 special issues, 6 supplements published every week. Each page contains 10 to 30 reports. Sometimes they use magnified photographs, lines, entoilages and lace to increase beauty grade. In 1958, the daily continually published more than 10 editorials on mechanization and semi-mechanization. The same year, a special column \\"Thought Discussion\\" was created (inspired by China Youth Daily), and attracted many manuscripts received from the folks. Liu Shaoqi once participated in a discussion on \\"Should the communists have individual voluntary?\\", his words was sorted out in an article published by Beijing Daily. In the atmosphere of Great Leap Forward, it also falsely reported many cases of ever-higher grain production. For example, there was a report stating that a production brigade could raise the rice yield to 5000 - 6000 jin per mu. In 1961, the newspaper office and the department of village affairs of Beijing committee formed a survey group to investigate the villager's views about collective dining rooms. They found out that most villagers are opposed to eat in those rooms, and published a report about that. As an official media, Beijing Daily has propagated many stories of \\"advanced individuals\\" and \\"advanced collectivities\\". Among them are: tiler Zhang Baifa, woodcutter's crew leader Li Ruihuan, fitter Ni Zhifu, hygiene worker Shi Chuanxiang, Tianqiao Department Store, Shijingshan Steel Corporation Dolomite Workshop, Pack Basket Store at Zhoukoudian Supply & Marketing Cooperative, Nanhanji Production Brigade, salesman Zhang Binggui, Great Wall Raincoat Company manager Zhang Jieshi and Big Bowl Tea Trade Group. From January to March 1971, it continually published hundreds of stories, quotations, and photographs of Wang Fuguo, a Daxing County party branch secretary. These reports strongly exaggerated his \\"routes struggle\\" consciousness. In September 1973, it published a letter from a primary school student who had conflicts with his teacher. The letter was praised by Gang of Four, and was described as \\"introducing an important question about education reform\\". The Theory Weekly is published every Monday, comprising four pages. Its main readers are members of party and government organizations. About a third of the articles are less than 1000 words. Three fifths of the theory propaganda articles appear on the front page of the weekly. About half of the articles are interpretations to CPC files or lectures given by party leaders. 1/4 of articles discuss social problems and social thoughts.

Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters James T. Kirk and Spock respectively in the 1960s Star Trek television series, the 1970s animated television series, and their film sequels. They talk about differences they had with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, and about the strained relationships between Shatner and some of the other cast members. It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with alcoholism while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism. Mind Meld was produced to advertise Shatner's personal website. Filming took place at Nimoy's home on September 5, 2001, and Billy West narrated the title sequence. The film's title refers to a fictional practice in Star Trek‚Äîa mind meld is a telepathic link that Vulcans are able to create with other organisms. Mind Meld was released for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the director's cut of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Mind Meld attracted some notoriety because of an unintended sound in one scene that became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Shatner denied being the source of this sound in multiple interviews; he and Mind Meld's director, Peter Jaysen, attributed it to equipment on set. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"F\\", and said that the only people likely to watch the film were extreme Star Trek fans and people interested in hearing Shatner's supposed flatulence. Laurence Lerman of Video Business praised the film for not \\"rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of Star Trek conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs\\", and instead for dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of Star Trek. Contents William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy respectively portrayed James T. Kirk and Spock in Star Trek, first in the 1960s television series (later retitled Star Trek: The Original Series), then in the 1970s television series Star Trek: The Animated Series, and subsequently in several Star Trek films between 1979 and 1994. In Mind Meld, they discuss the Star Trek media franchise and its enduring success. The film is, except for the title sequence, composed entirely of Shatner and Nimoy in conversation. Many of the topics they discuss were inspired by online questions from fans. The film starts in Nimoy's backyard, where the two sit on patio chairs, and then moves into Nimoy's library, which is filled with souvenirs. Nimoy (left) and Shatner as Spock and James T. Kirk in 1968, during production of Star Trek: The Original Series. In Mind Meld, Nimoy describes being an alcoholic at that time, and Shatner claims to have had sexual liaisons with Star Trek actresses. The film focuses on the effects Star Trek had on the lives of Shatner and Nimoy,Greenberger (2012), p. 220. with each actor interviewing the other about his fame. They talk about Star Treks origins and the death of DeForest Kelley, who had portrayed Leonard McCoy in both The Original Series and The Animated Series.Terrace (2011), p. 1011. Shatner and Nimoy also discuss interactions between themselves and others on the set of Star Trek, including conflicts. Both Shatner and Nimoy describe having had strained relationships with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, and attest to other members of the Original Series cast disliking Shatner. Only one of these cast members is referred to by name: Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Nyota Uhura. \\"I never fully comprehended what it was that was bothering them\\", says Shatner. Both men describe Star Trek as having put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding the legitimacy of consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. \\"It took me a while,\\" Nimoy says, \\"but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never had to worry about work ever since Star Trek went on the air.\\" Nimoy reveals that he was an alcoholic at the time of the original Star Trek series‚Äîsomething that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed \\"a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year\\" of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler. Shatner says that acting in Star Trek was \\"life-consuming\\" and left him \\"barely any time for family\\", and that this was the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He describes a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, Star Trek actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's fine-art photography, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that Star Trek became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been typecast as a result of their roles in Star Trek, and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at science fiction conventions, the fans seem to like each other more than they like the science fiction actors. The film concludes with Nimoy putting his arm around Shatner's shoulder and saying, \\"You're my best friend.\\" Production Voice actor Billy West narrated Mind Melds title sequence. Mind Meld was produced as a way of advertising Shatner's personal website, williamshatner.com, which offered features including the Shatner and Friends fan club's quarterly newsletter, semi-regular updates on Shatner's life, and a photograph of Shatner with the gorilla Koko. Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old. Shatner asked Nimoy if he would be willing to discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed. Nimoy later said that no one had ever asked him about this part of his past, and that discussing it in Mind Meld \\"was an opportunity to put out some information that might be helpful to some people.\\" Filming took place on September 5, 2001, in high-definition video at Nimoy's home, under the direction of Peter Jaysen. There was no script; the conversation between Shatner and Nimoy was ad lib. The title sequence of Mind Meld is narrated by veteran voice actor Billy West, who had previously voiced such characters as Zim in the television series Invader Zim, Ralph in Joe's Apartment, and Elmer Fudd in Looney Tunes: Back in Action.Lawson & Persons (2004), p. 342. While the filming session resulted in approximately two hours of footage, a significant portion of this was not used, resulting in a final runtime of 75 minutes. In an interview with science fiction magazine Starlog, Shatner said, \\"I don't think... that anything was cut because it was too personal or inflammatory. Edits were only made for time.\\" The title of the film refers to a fictional practice in Star Trek; a mind meld is a telepathic link that Spock is able to create with other organisms because he is part Vulcan.Dawson (2006), p. 79. Shatner summarized the film as being \\"two friends talking one- on-one\\". Release Mind Meld was released on VHS and DVD for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the director's cut of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, a film that Shatner and Nimoy agreed was not as good as they had hoped it would be. Mind Meld was produced by Creative Light Entertainment, a company that produced another filmed interview the following year‚ÄîStan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels, an interview of Marvel Comics publisher Stan Lee by film director Kevin Smith. The Mind Meld DVD offers widescreen and fullscreen options, Dolby Digital surround sound, and a five-minute \\"making of\\" featurette. Mind Meld T-shirts were available on Shatner's website. The film's release prompted Wil Wheaton, who had portrayed Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation, to change the name of his comic science fiction improvisational theatre company from \\"Mind Meld\\" to \\"EarnestBorg9\\".Wheaton (2004), p. 211. Shatner referred to The Original Series as \\"cartoonish\\" in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, \\"I never thought it was a cartoon ... I never thought it was beneath me.\\" In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, Shatner said Mind Meld was similar to My Dinner with Andre, and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, \\"This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before.\\" In April 2002, Mind Meld was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Two years later, Mind Meld was included in the bonus material when the first six Star Trek films were re-released as a special edition box set. =Alleged flatulence= Around 52 minutes and 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner is talking about the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of flatulence is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end. Howard Stern played the sound on his radio show several times, including when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series Iron Chef USA on November 13, 2001.Dawson (2006), p. 80. When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the boom operator. A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a squeaky jib. On Conan O'Brien's Late Night program on November 14, Shatner called it \\"outrageous\\" that Buckman should assume him to be the source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, \\"You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!\\" Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that it may have been a dog bark or a bird call. According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved. \\"It was probably some machine that nobody heard\\", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. \\"The controversy is over.\\" Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged flatulence in Mind Meld, which he compares to the sound of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film. Reception In his review of Mind Meld, Mike Clark of USA Today called the discussion between Shatner (left) and Nimoy (right) \\"surprisingly frank\\". Sarah Sloboda of The New York Times wrote that Mind Meld \\"provides a genuine glimpse of the lives of the stars shadowed by the roles that defined their public personas, and the mutual experience that binds them as friends\\". Gross praised the video quality, but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that \\"even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor\\". Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme Star Trek fans are people interested in hearing the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film \\"seemingly interminable\\" and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they \\"rival black holes in sheer self- absorption\\". According to John Henzell, writing for The Press of New Zealand, Mind Melds trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical. Vern Perry of the Orange County Register called the film fascinating, writing that it skilfully combined humor and earnestness. He wrote that it was moving to see the two actors talk about their personal lives with such vulnerability‚Äîparticularly when Nimoy discusses his experiences with alcoholism. Greg Stacy of OC Weekly reported being \\"thoroughly charmed\\" by the film, and called \\"the affection between [Shatner and Nimoy] obvious and touching.\\" Laurence Lerman of Video Business praised Mind Meld for not \\"rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of Star Trek conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs\\", but instead dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of Star Trek. Mike Clark of USA Today praised Shatner's interviewing abilities and wrote that the film was engaging. Clark called Shatner's and Nimoy's conversation \\"surprisingly frank\\", but added that Shatner was \\"full of himself\\". A review in British newspaper The Guardian summarized Mind Meld as \\"a couple of gents sitting around talking\\".

He played college football at Michigan. Early years Cole grew up in Tarpon Springs, Florida, and attended East Lake High School. He was a four-year starter for the East Lake football team and was a participant in the 2014 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. He was also a first-team all-state player in Florida during the 2013 season. Cole's high school coach, Bob Hudson, said of him: \\"He's that guy, as a coach, that you want a whole team of. He does what he's supposed to do. He stays out of trouble. He's not late to meetings. He's not lazy. He's always moving. He's coachable. He can take criticism. He doesn't need praise every play. He's what you dream of as a coach.\\" College career Cole had scholarship offers from numerous universities, including Alabama, Florida, Florida State and Ohio State. In February 2013, he announced his verbal commitment to the University of Michigan. Cole enrolled early at Michigan in January 2014 at age 17. He was impressive in spring practice and in fall practice, leading to speculation that he might start as a true freshman. Running back Justice Hayes said: \\"Mason is a phenomenal player, he is a freshman but he doesn't play like it at all. He plays like he's been there for a couple years.\\" On August 30, 2014, at age 18, Cole became the first Michigan offensive lineman to start in the season opener of his true freshman season, and the first to start at left tackle as a true freshman. Since true freshmen became eligible in 1972, only five have started any games on Michigan's offensive line: Bubba Paris (one game in 1978), Tom Dixon (one game in 1980), Dean Dingman (three games in 1987), Justin Boren (one game in 2006) and Kyle Bosch (three games in 2013). In the 2014 season opener, Michigan backs set a Michigan single-game record with 9.7 yards per carry (350 yards on 36 carries), and the offensive line was credited with the outburst. Following the 2016 season, Cole was named to the All-Big Ten offensive second-team, by both the coaches and media. Following the 2017 season, Cole was again named to the All-Big Ten offensive second-team, by both the coaches and media. Professional career On December 18, 2017, it was announced that Cole accepted his invitation to the Senior Bowl. On January 27, 2018, Cole played in the 2018 Reese's Senior Bowl as part of Denver Broncos' head coach Vance Joseph's North team that lost 45-16 to Houston Texans' head coach Bill O'Brien's South team. Cole attended the NFL Scouting Combine and performed all of the combine drills. On March 23, 2018, Cole participated at Michigan's pro day and performed the vertical jump (27.5\\"), short shuttle (4.72s), and positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Cole was projected to be a fourth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the fifth best center prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and Scouts Inc. The Arizona Cardinals selected Cole in the third round (97th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Cole was the fourth center drafted in 2018. On May 31, 2018, the Arizona Cardinals signed Cole to a four-year, $3.32 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $761,516. He was named the Cardinals starting center in 2018, and started all 16 games. Cole entered the 2019 season as a backup interior lineman. He started two games at left guard in place of injury.

History Interior of the All Saints' Church The decision to build an Anglican church at Galle, was initiated by the first Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. James Chapman. The foundation of the church was laid on 30 October 1868, by Rev. Dr. Piers Calveley Claughton, the second Bishop of Colombo. The construction of the church was facilitated by a grant of the land and ¬£600 from the 13th Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hercules Robinson. A further ¬£1,000 contribution was received from an English parish. The church was designed by J.G. Smithers, the government architect, who later designed the National Museum of Colombo. The church was constructed on the site of a former Court House (1780s). The gallows it is said stood on the site of the present altar. The Anglican congregation in Galle which, up to then, worshipped in the Dutch Church. The church was consecrated on 21 February 1871 by Bishop Claughton, assisted by the church's first vicar, Rev. Dr. George Justus Schrader (1829-1875). In recognition of Rev. Dr. Schrader's significant contribution to the church, a large bell was placed in his memory in the centre dome of the church in 1876. In the mid 1960s, for security reasons the bell was lowered and was left to be sold. It was subsequently bought by the diocese and is now housed in the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour in Colombo. The current bell was acquired by the church in 1968. The bell came from the Liberty Ship, \\"Ocean Verity\\", and was donated by the Clan Line Steamship Company. The first Baptism at All Saints was Lilian Slade Godolphin Ozanne on 21 February 1871 and the first marriage was held on 25 March 1871, between James Weir and Jane Strene King. Architecture It was built on a basilican plan in a Victorian Gothic Revival style of architecture, modified to suit local climate. The plan of the Church is cruciform firmly supported on stone columns and arches carved beautifully in timber. Masonry arches built in local kabuk and lime mortar. The heavy pews, with carvings of the Jewish Star of David, and the sanctuary are all made from Burmese teak.

Examples of popular songs include , \\"Only Love\\" (1988) and . During the second half of the 1980s, the band boasted a tremendous effort of touring Japan with a series of live performances. Beginning with the latter half of the 1990s, they entered a sort of recession, which was since 2005 accompanied for a while by vocalist Otomo wanting to separate from other band members in order to pursue a solo career. This ultimately developed into a lawsuit throwing the band into a state of confusion. As of 2018, Otomo is now but the only actual member left in the band. In the United States, Hound Dog are best known for the single \\"R‚òÖO‚òÖC‚òÖK‚òÖS\\", one of the opening themes to the Naruto anime. History While attending Tohoku Gakuin University in 1976, guitarist and founding member Yoshihide Takahashi (È´òÊ©ãËâØÁßÄ ) gave the impetus to form the band when he called out to Kohei Otomo by saying \\"Let's do it together!\\". Otomo then adopted the name of the band from an Elvis Presley hit song of the same name that he adored very much. In 1980, the band achieved its debut with the single . Despite many ups and downs such as changing members in 1984, Hound Dog had since then managed to continue a lasting activity within the Japanese rock scene. The said activity is considered to mainly consist of their live performances. Without any hit songs at all, the band managed to gather a crowd of roughly ten thousand people for their first public debut at Nippon Budokan, after which they continued their live tour for a period of around three years. For the sake of local students, who despite buying tickets, were not able to go due to school guidelines, the band organized another live performance at the same place once again in an effort to communicate their message of \\"music being heck of a wonderful thing\\". Students were allowed to use their graduation certificates as tickets (which essentially meant that it was free of charge). Also, the live concert's closing time was set to an earlier hour for the sake of safety, and it was decided to have it take place somewhere not dangerous for the students. This entire arrangement left the band with an unprecedented achievement on their track record. In 1989, Hound Dog performed a 15-day live concert marathon, which came to be the longest string of performances in the history of Nippon Budokan. This record has not been broken as of 2017. Beginning with 1981, the Rock'n'Roll Olympics were held annually near the outskirts of Sendai City, turning into the forerunner of Japanese outdoor rock festivals. Furthermore, fund-raising and charity live activities such as the Hiroshima \\"Peace Concert\\" and the \\"Dream Island Live Concert\\" were performed by Hound Dog over the years as a form of social participation events.

He was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1888 to 1912, representing North-Eastern District. History Warren was born the son of John Warren Snr at Coxton Farm, near Elgin, Morayshire, Scotland. His father emigrated to South Australia in 1838, perhaps on the same boat as his friend Thomas Hogarth. The son followed four years later and joined his parents at Mount Crawford. Warren joined Hogarth in developing a pastoral lease at Strangways Springs until the death of Hogarth, then around 1882 another lease near the Australian Overland Telegraph Line with Hogarth's sons. In 1852 he went to the Victorian gold fields for a brief period. On his return to South Australia he became Chairman of Mt Crawford District Council. Warren married Margaret Hogarth on 11 December 1963, six months after the death of his mother, Lydia Campbell Warren (ca.1785 ‚Äì 1 June 1863). They had 12 children, including: *John Campbell Warren, who married Lillie May Dale on 4 August 1892 *Alexander Blair Warren (18 May 1868 ‚Äì 17 January 1909) married Isabella Gertrude Andrews on 20 August 1907. Isabella was a daughter of Walter Boyd Tate Andrews (1823-1899) *Elliot D. C. Warren, who married Marjory Dale Hood on 27 April 1910 Warren's sister Jane married William Bakewell on 20 April 1844. Warren was an enthusiastic member of the voluntary militia, which he joined in 1861. He was presented with the Imperial long service medal and was captain of the Williamstown Company until it was disbanded, when he was appointed acting captain attached to the Gawler Mounted Infantry. He was an expert marksman and almost never missed a parade, but was never promoted. Warren was also a prominent member of the Church of England. Warren took an active interest in the development of the Northern Territory, and as early as 1862 was largely interested in a sheep station on the route of the transcontinental telegraph line, which station he carried on in partnership with his brothers-in-law (the Messrs. Hogarth). Politics In 1884 he contested the Assembly seat of Barossa, but was unsuccessful. In 1888 he sat for the Legislative Council for the North-Eastern district as a colleague of Henry Ayers and was successful. He was reelected at the end of his term in 1896 and continued to represent his district until 1912, when he quit politics. He was by then almost totally blind, having injured his eyes in an explosion. Warren was supportive of women's right to vote and felt that women of property should be allowed to vote. In 1891 he introduced a Bill to grant universal suffrage for South Australian women but it did not pass. Recognition John Warren of Springfield, Williamstown. State Library of South Australia B-62947 On 4 November 1912, after his retirement from the Legislative Council, he was presented with an oil painting of himself done by G. A. J. Webb. That painting is now held by the Art Gallery of South Australia. The Warren Reservoir, a water storage facility near Mount Crawford, and the Hundred of Warren on the Eyre Peninsula were named for him.

In some cases, women were misled into believing that the sterilization procedure was reversible. In other cases, sterilization was performed without the adequate understanding and consent of the patient, including cases in which the procedure was performed on minors as young as 11 years old. A compounding factor was the tendency of doctors to recommend sterilization to poor and minority women in cases where they would not have done so to a wealthier white patient. Other cases of abuse have been documented as well, including when health providers did not tell women they were going to be sterilized, or other forms of coercion including threatening to take away their welfare or healthcare. In 1976, a U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) investigation found that four Indian Health Service areas were noncompliant with IHS policies regulating consent to sterilization. Inadequate consent forms were a recurring problem; the most common form did not record whether the elements of informed consent had been presented to the patient or what they were told prior to obtaining consent, and physician misunderstanding of IHS regulations was widespread. The investigation found that these four service areas sterilized 3,406 women between the years 1973 and 1976, including 36 cases where women under the age of 21 were sterilized despite a declared moratorium on these sterilizations. Limitations of the GAO investigation were quickly noted. Senator James Abourezk pointed out that while even 3,406 sterilizations would represent a startling proportion of Native American women, this number was the result of a report which examined only four out of twelve IHS areas. Attempts to count the total number of sterilizations that happened during this period differ widely in their results. While the limited count by the GAO represents a minimum, Native American organizations have accused the IHS of sterilizing at least 25 percent of Native American women during this period, with some authors such as Lakota author Lehman Brightman placing the figure as high as 40 percent. Should the highest estimate be accurate, up to 70,000 women may have been sterilized over the period. In comparison, the rate of sterilization for white women over the same period was approximately 15%.  Types of sterilization  Hysterectomies and tubal ligation were the two main sterilization methods used. A hysterectomy is a procedure used to sterilize women where the uterus is removed through the women's abdomen or vagina. This operation was routinely used to sterilize Native American women during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. Another common form of sterilization was tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes are tied, blocked, or cut. For many women these procedures were done without consent, resulting in some approaching doctors for procedures like \\"womb transplants\\". In 1971, Dr. James Ryan stated that he favored hysterectomies over tubal ligations because \\"it's more of a challenge... and it's [a] good experience for the junior resident\\". This is suggestive of the attitude IHS doctors had towards their patients, as hysterectomies have a much greater rate of complications. Some forms of birth control other than sterilization were sometimes used, including Depo-Provera and Norplant. Depo-Provera was used on intellectually disabled Native American women before it gained clearance from the FDA in 1992. Norplant, promoted by the IHS, was marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (who were sued over insufficient disclosure of side effects including irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression). Side effects of these two forms of birth control included the cessation of the menstrual cycle and excessive bleeding. Using 2002 data from the National Survey of Family Growth, the Urban Indian Health Institute found that among women using contraception, the most common methods used by urban American Indian and Alaskan Native women age 15‚Äì44 years were female sterilization (34%), oral contraceptive pills (21%), and male condoms (21%). However among the urban Non-Hispanic Whites, the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills 36%), female sterilization (20%) and male condoms (18%). Today, although the Indian Health Service continues to use sterilization as a method of family planning, tubal ligation and vasectomy are the only procedures which may be performed for the primary purpose of sterilization. Today legally, the IHS requires the patient to give informed consent to the operation, be 21 years of age or older, and not be institutionalized in a correctional or mental health facility. The Indian Health Services The IHS logo The Indian Health Services (IHS) is a government organization created in 1955 to help combat poor health and living conditions of Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The IHS still exists in the United States, and is a blend of various organizations created to combat specific health problems for Native American and Alaskan Natives. The IHS's website states that \\"the IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people, and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 573 federally recognized tribes in 37 states.\\" In 1955, Congress had given IHS the responsibility of providing these health services, but at the time they didn't have enough physicians to conduct safe and proper procedures. After raising the pay for physicians' wages, safety improved, and they began to provide birth control treatment which ultimately led to the practice of sterilization. The history of forced sterilization in the United States The practice of eugenics stemmed from Francis Galton's writings on using genetics to improve the human race. The eugenics movement became increasingly popular, and in 1907, Indiana was America's first state to enact a compulsory sterilization law. The practice became normalized and over the next twenty years fifteen more states would enact similar laws. In 1927, the Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell upheld a compulsory sterilization law in Virginia. The case involved three generations of women from the Buck family: Emma, Carrie and Vivian. By examining multiple generations of women from the same family, advocates for eugenics hoped to convince the Court that Carrie Bell had intellectual deficiencies that were hereditary and a danger to public welfare; they succeeded, and she was forcibly sterilized. Oliver Wendell Holmes‚Äô decision stated, \\"it is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sanctions compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\\" The case had the effect of legitimizing existing sterilization laws, resulting in greater acceptance of the practice. During the 1960s and 70s as sterilization practices increased there was no legislation that prohibited it and it was seen as a viable form of contraception. In the 1974 case Relf v. Weinberger, a district court found that Department of Health and Human Services regulations on sterilization were \\"arbitrary and unreasonable\\" because they failed to adequately guarantee the consent of the patient. This case was part of a growing awareness during the 1970s that abuse of sterilization procedures was becoming a serious problem. Among other facts revealed in the case, it was found that 100,000 to 150,000 people were sterilized every year using money from federally funded programs. Exposure from the case resulted in recognition that the poor and minorities were at risk of being targeted for sterilizations they did not consent to, and this led to the legal requirement that informed consent be received before the operation.  Motivations  This was a pamphlet created by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to urge Native American women to have fewer children. The left shows how the parents would be before adopting promoted family planning practices (tired and with little resources) and afterwards (happy and wealthy). Native American women were not the only individuals to be subjected to forced sterilizations; black and poor women were also affected by these practices. In the 1970s, after being forced onto reservations by the United States government, or relocated into urban areas without adequate support, many Native Americans were struggling with poverty. Native American people depended on government organizations like the IHS, Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Indian Health Service (IHS) was their main health provider. Because Native Americans were dependent on these government organizations for health services, they were more at risk for forced sterilization than other groups. Most of the physicians performing this procedure viewed sterilization as the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and their family's quality of life. Many of these physicians believed that Native American women were not intelligent enough to use other methods of birth control, wrote Jane Lawrence in American Indian Quarterly. Thus, sterilizing these patients was seen as the most reliable birth control method. When doctors were polled on their recommendations to patients they received in private practice, only 6% recommended sterilization, while 14% would recommend it to those on welfare. When they were asked about their attitudes regarding birth control policies, 94% said they would approve of compulsory sterilization for a mother on welfare with three or more children. With fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs. Poor women, the disabled, and the women of color were targeted for similar reasons. In addition, the influx of surgical procedures was seen as good training for physicians and as a practice for resident physicians. One theory suggests that IHS doctors were underpaid and overworked and they sterilized Native American women so they would have less work in the future. The average new IHS recruit made $17,000 to $20,000 a year and worked around 60 hours per week. In 1974 the ratio of doctors to patients was dangerously low, with \\"only one doctor to 1,700 reservation Indians.\\" The problems caused by a lack of doctors were exacerbated even further when a program to draft doctors into the military was terminated in 1976. This directly affected the IHS because they recruited many of their doctors from the military. Between 1971 and 1974 applications for vacant IHS positions went from 700 to 100 applications, meaning that the burden of additional work fell on an ever decreasing number of doctors. One important distinction is between doctors who worked for the IHS directly, and other doctors who performed sterilizations through a contractual arrangement with the IHS. For IHS doctors, there was no financial incentive to perform sterilizations, and therefore other considerations likely played the primary role. Doctors under contract were paid more when they sterilized women instead of giving them oral contraceptives, making a financial incentive more plausible. Even though there was no financial incentive for the IHS doctors to recommend sterilization, as previously discussed, sterilization was seen as the ideal form of contraception for Native American patients during the 1960s and 1970s. IHS doctors had mostly white and middle-class views of family planning, with an emphasis on a nuclear family containing a small number of children. The presumption that Native American women desired the same family structure as middle class white Americans helped make sterilization abuse possible. Effects of sterilization A direct effect of sterilization of Native American women was that the Native American birth rate decreased. In the 1970s, the average birth rate of Native American women was 3.7; however, in 1980 it fell to 1.8 partially as a result of sterilization. In comparison, the average white woman was expected to have 2.42 children in 1970, a birth rate that slowed to 2.14 per woman by 1980. By some counts, at least 25% of Native American women between the ages of fifteen and forty-four were sterilized during the most intensive period. Native women lost economic and political power by not being able to reproduce as well. Without the ability to reproduce, native culture becomes extinct, because without children no one will carry on their culture. The decline in birth rate was a quantifiable effect, however, sterilization impacted many Native American women in non- quantifiable ways as well. Within Native American culture a woman's fertility is greatly valued, leading to psychological and social consequences from sterilization. For a woman to be unable to bear children would cause shame, embarrassment and possible condemnation from the individual's tribe due to how Native American peoples view motherhood. In 1977, lawyer Michael Zavalla filed a case with Washington State after three Cheyenne women from Montana were sterilized without their consent. However, the sterilized women remained anonymous because they feared tribal repercussions. As Marie Sanchez, Chief tribal judge for the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, explained, \\"even more discouraging than high legal bills is the risk of losing one's place in the Indian community, where sterilization has particular religious resonance.\\" In some areas, the sterilization procedure was insufficiently sterile, which led to complications. When complications arose, additional medical treatment was required, but government funding only covered the procedure itself. Because most women could not afford follow-up medical care, in many cases they did not receive it, and some died as a result. Native American women and men do not fully trust the U.S. government due to forced sterilization, and remain skeptical of contraceptive technologies..

Shipley is a retired United States Navy SEAL, who has gained recognition for his activism investigating and publicizing individuals who have made false claims of military service. Military service Don Shipley joined the United States Navy in 1978 and became a Navy SEAL in 1984 after graduating BUD/S class 131. Shipley served in SEAL Team One, SEAL Team Two, the Naval Special Warfare Center, Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S), and Naval Special Warfare Group Two (NSWG-2), NAB Little Creek, Virginia as a SEAL Advanced Training Instructor. While serving with SEAL Team Two, Shipley conducted operations in Bosnia and Liberia. He became the first non-corpsman SEAL to graduate from paramedic school. He served in eight SEAL platoons, was platoon chief in five, and awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism during a search and rescue mission. Setting records for immense water and land demolition shots and running high-risk training courses, he served as an explosive expert instructing police departments across the country in booby traps and improvised explosive devices. When not in a SEAL platoon or deployed overseas, his time was spent running blocks of training for SEALs in air operations, land warfare, and demolitions. After 24 years of Navy service, he retired as a senior chief petty officer in 2003. Post-military life After retirement, Shipley worked as a Security Contractor for Blackwater Security Consulting, spending a year in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Shipley ran a training course with several former U.S. Navy SEALs called Extreme SEAL Experience which trained potential SEALs as well as individuals who were interested in experiencing the rigors of SEAL training. Don Shipley originally started Extreme SEAL Experience in 1992 for the United States Navy. It was designed to train Sea Cadets for recruitment purposes. It later transformed into a full program designed to prepare those interested in Naval Special Warfare for the intense nature of BUD/S training. Activism activities Shipley has garnered attention for his work investigating individuals who claim to have served as SEALs or other high-profile military service claims. He and his wife Diane produced a series of YouTube videos, \\"Phony Navy SEAL of the Week\\", which combined footage of Shipley telephoning individuals suspected of false claims and questioning them to determine if stolen valor had occurred and how far the individual would persist in a deceptive claim. The videos also included interactions between him and Diane and video clips that related to the topic at hand. The YouTube series transitioned into a series of video segments which are privately hosted on his website Extreme SEAL Videos on a paid subscription basis. In addition to a featured show in which Don and Diane travel around the country to engage individuals that may have stolen valor, there are other video segments, including Q&A; sessions, a cooking show hosted by Diane, and footage from the Extreme SEAL Experience training course. Shipley has also been a Special Guest Contributor at 'SOFREP.com'.http://sofrep.com/about-sofrep-com/ SOFREP.com The site provides news and analysis from former military and Special Operations veterans. He states, \\"...the FBI estimates that there are 300 SEAL Impostors for every living Navy SEAL. Verifying at least a dozen and often over 20 fraudulent SEAL claims each day, I put the number much, much higher than 300.\\" He estimates there are roughly 17,600 who have completed Naval Special Warfare training since 1943, about 10,000 of these are alive, and 2,400 of them on active duty. Shipley's YouTube channel was terminated as of February 21, 2019. He alleged that it was in retaliation for exposing activist Nathan Phillips' claims of having been a Vietnam veteran and \\"recon ranger\\" when Phillips had only served in the Marine Corps Reserve as a refrigerator technician and anti-tank missile man. YouTube issued a statement saying the account was terminated because Shipley was sharing too much identifying information including home addresses and phone numbers in violation of YouTube policies that could lead to harassment of others.

(NFC), also called \\"Natfruit\\", is a Thai privately owned fruit wholesaler, specializing in pineapple. It was established on 17 March 2001 to manufacture canned pineapple and pineapple juice concentrate. The company was established with a registered capital of 84 million baht. The factory has production capacity of 400 tons of raw material per day and employs a workforce of from 500 to 800 persons. Natfruit is located in Pran Buri, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, an area known for its pineapples. Natfruit is part of NatGroup, a family-owned assortment of related private businesses. It includes Prafic (aloe vera products), Prafic 2005 (dried fruits) as well as packaging and logistics companies. Natural Fruit labour practices In 2013 and 2014 the company attracted notoriety for its lawsuits‚Äîtwo criminal and two civil damage claims seeking 400 million baht (US$11 million)‚Äîagainst British human rights worker Andy Hall. Hall had been commissioned by Finnish NGO Finnwatch to investigate migrant labour rights abuses in Thai factories supplying Finnish retailers. He submitted his findings to Finnwatch, which published a report based on them on its website. Hall was listed as a co- author, although he had no hand in writing the report, which is entirely in the Finnish language, but with an executive summary in English. The summary enumerated human and labour rights violations (such as the use of underage labour, migrant worker passport confiscation, and unpaid overtime) by Natfruit. In 2013, Natfruit filed suit against Hall for defamation and violation of the Thai Act on Computer Crime for allegedly making false statements to public media. Conviction on this charge could lead to seven years in prison and a fine of up to ¬£6.6 million. One of the Andy Hall prison sentences was cancelled by the Supreme Court in Thailand in November 2016. Other lawsuits continue.Thaimaan korkein oikeus hylk√§si kunnianloukkaussyytteen Finnwatchin tutkijaa vastaan YLE TV News 3.11.2016 On 18 September 2015, an appeals court threw out a defamation case, originally brought by Natural Fruit against Hall in September 2013, saying that police never should have investigated the charges. Natural Fruit accused Hall of defaming the company in an interview he gave to Al Jazeera while in Burma (Myanmar). The court said that because the interview did not take place in Thailand, the case had no grounds for being heard in Thailand. On 18 January 2016, Hall was indicted by a Bangkok court on charges of criminal defamation and computer crimes related to his investigations of Natfruit. He faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty at a 12-day trial at Bangkok South Criminal Court starting on 19 May. On 20 September 2016 Hall was found guilty of criminal defamation and in violation of Thailand's Computer Crimes Act. The court sentenced Hall to prison for four years and ordered him to pay a 150,000 baht fine. His prison sentence was reduced to three years and suspended for two years because of his record as a human rights defender. Hall will appeal the ruling. The president of Natural Fruit, Wirat Piyapornpaiboon, commented on the ruling by saying, \\"No foreigner should think they have power above Thai sovereignty,...\\" Natfruit actions have been criticized by a number of activist organizations (such as Finnwatch and Human Rights Watch), trade unions (such as International Transport Workers' Federation, International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association), as well as some European food companies. The State Enterprise Workers' Relations Confederation of Thailand (SERC) has voiced its support for Hall. The company has received support from the Thai government.http://finnwatch.org/en/news/188-finnwatch-researcher-andy-hall-to- defend-latest-natural-fruit-charges On 26 March 2018, the Prakanong Court in Bangkok issued its verdict on the civil damages claim against Hall, ordering him to pay 10 million baht (US$320,000) in damages to the company. The court also ordered Hall to pay 10,000 baht to the plaintiff's lawyer and court fees including interest of 7.5 percent from the date of filing this case until the amount is fully paid. Hall will appeal the decision. On 31 May 2018 the Thai Court of Appeals acquitted Hall of defamation, overturning a lower court ruling. Natural Fruit Co Ltd sued Hall for defamation following an interview he gave to Al-Jazeera English TV in Myanmar in April 2013. The Appeals Court ruled that Hall had not acted unlawfully as charged by the prosecution. The court further ruled that, based on the evidence before it, Hall had indeed interviewed migrant workers from Natural Fruit's factory and there was the real possibility of labour rights violations against migrant workers at Natural Fruit. Natural Fruit can appeal the Appeals Court ruling to the Thai Supreme Court.

Its secretariat and coordinating personnel is hosted by the Third World Institute, whose international seat is based in Montevideo, Uruguay. Adopting a critical-liberal stance, Social Watch is focused on: # the eradication of poverty and the causes of poverty, # an end to all forms of discrimination and racism, # an equitable distribution of wealth, and # the realization of human rights, emphasizing ‚Äòthe right of all people not to be poor‚Äô. On these fronts, Social Watch engages both United Nations-sponsored and related intergovernmental initiatives that address global governance issues, as well as simultaneously coordinating a vast network of grassroots activist‚Äîso-called ‚ÄòWatchers‚Äô (over 80 in both North and South)--that monitor compliance with international covenants.Carroll, William. 2015. \\"Modes of Cognitive Praxis in Transnational Alternative Policy Groups\\".

News generated by Watchers in various countries is regularly updated on the Social Watch website. Each year, their reports are also condensed and compiled into an overall Social Watch Report, widely distributed in intergovernmental and non-governmental organization circles, as well as back to the grassroots communities of Watchers.
