It is required by the California Constitution. Student regents serve an approximately one-year term as 'student regent-designate', followed by a one- year term as a full voting member of the Regents. The 2019-2020 student regent is Hayley Weddle, a UCSD graduate student, and the student regent-designate is Jamaal Muwwakkil, a UCSB graduate student.https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/30/former-bruin-nominated-to-be-uc- student-regent-designate/ Shapero, Julia, \\"Former Bruin Nominated to be UC Student Regent-designate,\\" The Daily Bruin' '2019-05-30, retrieved 2020-13-20.  Selection process  Virtually any UC student in good academic standing may apply to be student regent. Southern and northern regional UC student nominating commissions annually select ten semifinalists from those who apply. These semifinalists are then interviewed by the University of California Student Association (UCSA) board of directors. The board chooses three applicants, who are then interviewed by the Regents‚Äô Special Committee to Select a Student Regent. The Regents may reject the list of finalists. The committee then recommends a nominee to the full board of University of California Regents, which then votes on the nominee. Once approved, the nominee becomes 'student regent-designate', shadowing the student regent for approximately one academic year until the beginning of their formal, year-long term on July 1 of the next year. Traditionally, the position alternates between undergraduate and graduate students as well as between the various UC campuses. However, some students involved in the selection process have said that it may be biased towards graduate students as well as students from UCLA and UC Berkeley, traditionally considered the flagship campuses of the UC system.  History  Student regents have been noted for their support of affirmative action and diversity, and opposition of nuclear weapons research and fee increases. In May 2011, student regent Jesse Cheng resigned after being arrested for allegedly committing sexual battery against a UCLA graduate student. Cheng was found responsible for \\"unwanted touching\\" by UC Irvine's student conduct office, but the Orange County District Attorney declined to file charges against him. The student regent-designate at the time, Alfredo Mireles, was appointed voting student regent after Cheng's resignation. In 2013, the nomination of Sadia Saifuddin, the first Muslim student regent, was criticized by pro-Israel and conservative entities, such as StandWithUs and David Horowitz, due to Saifuddin's past support for disinvestment from Israel. In the final vote to appoint Saifuddin, only Regent Richard C. Blum abstained from voting in favor. Regent Norman Pattiz was not present at the time of the vote. During June 2013, student regent Jonathan Stein was a member of the Regents committee that selected Janet Napolitano to be nominated and presented to the full Board of Regents for a confirmation vote. In 2014, the appointment of Saifuddin's successor, Avi Oved, was opposed by students and student groups, including Students for Justice in Palestine, due to conflict of interest and transparency concerns. The Daily Californian reported that when running for an elected student government position at UCLA, Oved received campaign donations from Israeli-American businessman Adam Milstein that were secretly routed through Hillel's UCLA chapter. Oved and his supporters responded that UCLA's student government election regulations did not require disclosure of donors, and that the opposition was motivated by anti-Semitism. The UC Student Association nominating committee voted to delay its nomination of Oved in order to fully investigate, but the Board of Regents rejected the delay and voted to appoint Oved, with only Saifuddin voting in opposition. In January 2016, Oved and his successor, Marcela Ramirez, attended costly Regents' dinners paid for by university funds. The dinners were criticized by state legislative leaders, government watchdog groups, student government leaders, and students at large. The dinners appeared to violate university policy, and after The San Francisco Chronicle publicly reported the dinners' existence and funding, university leaders said they would no longer pay for the dinners. In May 2016, UC Berkeley Law student Paul Monge Rodriguez was nominated to be student regent for the 2017-2018 academic year. Monge previously criticized Berkeley's discipline of then-law dean Sujit Choudhry for sexual harassment, calling it a \\"slap on the wrist\\". = List of student regents = {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |+List of student regents ! scope=\\"col\\" |No. ! scope=\\"col\\" |Student regent ! scope=\\"col\\" |Term as regent ! scope=\\"col\\" |Campus ! scope=\\"col\\" |Student status during term ! scope=\\"col\\" |Major or field of study during term |- ! scope=\\"row\\" |1 |Carol Mock |1975‚Äì1976 |Santa Barbara |senior |political science |- ! scope=\\"row\\" |2 |Daryn Peeples |1976‚Äì1977 |Berkeley |senior |English |- ! scope=\\"row\\" |3 |Michael S.

It stars Alex Hammond, Anthony Topham and Tia Kenny. Credence is the story of a family of two torn gay fathers, who sacrifice their lives to save their daughter in the last evacuation from the Earth, before its devastation. Credence is challenging standard LGBT portrayal in films, and follows Buonaiuto's previous campaigns #LoveAlwaysWins, Homecoming, and Invisible Parents. Credence premiered on 17 May 2015 at the Prince Charles Cinema. Plot Credence portrays a family torn apart during the last evacuation on earth after violent storms have made continued survival on the planet impossible. Hope has been found in the form of new worlds that support human life, however due to limited rocket capacity and life expectancy only children are permitted to evacuate, and even then only the rich have ended up getting tickets. Two fathers decide to make the ultimate sacrifice, to ensure the survival of their daughter, and the entire human race. Production The preview production for the film began in early 2014. The Director described his concept as ‚Äúa universal message that in any kind of tragedy it's important that couples come together and support one another,‚Äù. Filming took place in a house on the coast of Norfolk (England). On 13 July 2014, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on Indiegogo to support film production. The campaign raised ¬£6,000 in three days, and by the end it had ¬£22,189 ($37,090). filming began on 8 January 2015, and was finished 4 days later.

After the operation Kaneki develops ghoul-like tendencies and characteristics, and his rationality begins to wane. As one that now doesn't belong to humans or ghouls he struggles to keep his ghoul identity secret, always fighting against his ghoul side while trying to continue to live like a normal human. He later works as a waiter for Anteiku under Yoshimura's guidance. After his fight with a CCG investigator named Amon he gains the name Eye Patch (ÁúºÂ∏Ø) because of his mask's design and becomes somewhat famous after a ghoul saw him defeating the investigator. He loves to read and is normally quiet and reserved but can also be calculating when fighting. He has a bad trait of easily trusting strangers which sometimes puts him in life-threatening situations. After being kidnapped by the ghoul run organization known as Aogiri Tree, he is mercilessly tortured by a sadistic ghoul named Yakumo ≈åmori (Yamori), and later develops similar traits to his torturer. While being tortured he has hallucinations of Rize in which she mocks him about his mother, leading to him finally embracing his inner ghoul. In the manga at chapter 61, Kaneki's hair slowly changes color from black to white. In the anime, Tokyo ghoul, his hair changes instantly after eating Rize and accepting his ghoul side. He then goes on and eats his torturer, Yakumo ≈åmori. His view on strength changes and he goes on a power hungry path by cannibalizing other ghouls in order to get stronger. The continued cannibalization led him to become a half kakuja, where he develops a centipede shaped kagune and gains the alias Centipede (ÁôæË∂≥). After the incident at Kan≈ç's Lab, Kaneki begins to regret this path and begins reflecting on his actions and motives. :After being defeated and captured by Arima, Ken loses his memories and is given the new identity of , member and ace of the Mado Squad, and mentor of the Quinx Squad, a special unit composed of artificial ghouls. Despite having a new identity, Haise still retains some traits from his former self, like the love for reading and the determination to protect his companions with his life. When pressured to the limit, Haise has glimpses of his former self and unlocks his powers as a ghoul, forcing the CCG to strike him with RC suppressors to calm him down. Haise usually has an internal conflict with his past self, fearing that one day he would lose his current life with all his new friends and personality, which intensifies as he obtains more information about his former life until the raid at the Tsukiyama Headquarters, when he finally regains his memories and accepts his identity as Kaneki, not only showing a ruthless demeanor when facing his enemies, but a cold attitude toward his current and former allies as well. Haise's achievements allow him to quickly climb among the CCG's ranks, being promoted to First Class after the raid at the human auction and receiving a special promotion to Associate Special Class after single-handedly driving away the One-Eyed Owl during the raid at the Tsukiyama Headquarters, becoming known as the , until he betrays the CCG to help T≈çka rescue Hinami from the Cochlea, releasing the other ghouls imprisoned there in the occasion. After Kaneki defeats Arima, he claims for himself the title of , who according to Eto, has the potential to break the current status quo between ghouls and humans. For that purpose, he assembles the surviving members of Aogiri, the inmates from Cochlea rescued by him, several rogue CCG Investigators, and his old friends from Anteiku into a new organization called \\"Goat\\" which hopes to bring peace between humans and ghouls. After his fight with Juzo, he lost all his limbs and after all of his personalities argue about what to do, he consumes all the oggai squad (a new group of artificial ghouls made by Kano) and becomes a giant mass of kagune. He was later rescued by T≈çka and the members of the Quinx squad. After regaining consciousness, he reunited with his best friend, Hideyoshi, whom he thought was dead. ; : :Played by: Fumika Shimizu; Maika Yamamoto :An eighteen-year-old ghoul of the 20th ward, Touka works part-time as a waitress in Anteiku and attends high school. She blends in well with human society and believes that keeping one's ghoul identity is of top most priority. She normally has a calm demeanor, but can be rash and somewhat aggressive, stemming from the fugitive life she had to live after CCG killed her father when she was very young. She is a powerful fighter who is more than a match for either Sh≈´ Tsukiyama or Nishiki Nishio on even grounds, though not nearly as strong as Renji. She becomes Kaneki's guide to the ghoul world as well as his training partner. She also takes up the role as Hinami's guardian after her parents are killed by investigators and is very protective of her. She later comes to be known as after attacking some investigators as revenge for what happened to Hinami's mother, killing one of them in the process. Touka is also shown to be self-aware, as after she killed an investigator that was involved in the murder of Hinami's mother, she admits that a murderer such as herself deserved to die because killing for revenge is wrong. Despite her overall rash personality, she is a naturally kind girl who takes her job as a part of the Anteiku stability team very seriously. She also has a younger brother; Ayato, whom she raised before they both started to live in the 20th ward. Her brother would later joined Aogiri Tree because he did not like the fact that she enjoys living among the humans. This is made very apparent after she starts attending high school and talks fondly about Yoriko to him. Later on, Touka has revealed to Yoshimura that she has an interest in biology, particularly where humans and ghouls are concerned, and expressed that she would want to be a teacher in the future. After the time-skip, she is seen running a new coffee shop called \\":re\\" with Renji. Touka also appears to have matured some in that she is calmer and has a less aggressive demeanor than in her teenage years. She is fully aware of Kaneki's new identity, but is unwilling to force him to remember his past, although she admits that she is ready to support him should it happens and he decides to reunite with her, which he does once he defects from the CCG, mending their relationship and later becoming lovers. After consummating their relationship, it is later revealed that Touka is pregnant with their child and they got married. ; : : Played by Y≈´ Aoi : Rize was a girl with glasses that Ken encountered who tried to eat him after luring him out on a date with her. Parts of her body are transplanted into Ken after she is struck by fallen iron construction parts. Before the construction incident, Rize was a member of V, assigned to breed with the members of the Wash≈´ family, but escaped with Furuta's help. She was a very powerful, fearless and merciless ghoul, often preventing other ghouls from hunting in areas which she stole from them. She came to the 20th ward after wreaking havoc in the 11th ward, attracting the CCG Investigators to it. Before leaving, she killed the ghouls that were in charge and caused a shift in power. She is known as the \\"Binge Eater\\" by investigators and like Ken, she was very fond of reading. Originally believed to be killed during her encounter with Ken, it is later revealed that she is still alive and her body was used to produce materials for Ghoul/Human experiments by Dr. Kan≈ç, with Ken's transformation into a ghoul being the result of one of them. She is later rescued by Yomo. However, she is captured by Nimura Furuta and subsequently merged with the Dragon. She is eventually killed by Kaneki in his attempt to put an end to the Dragon's rampage over Tokyo. ; : :Played by: Shota Matsuda :A troublesome ghoul of the 20th ward with a well-known reputation: ghouls wouldn't even get involved with him. He is known as the \\"Gourmet\\" by investigators and is one of the most difficult ghouls to capture, especially because he hails from a powerful and rich family of ghouls with connections in the government. He is a part of the \\"Ghoul Restaurant\\" under the alias MM. He is a very powerful, cunning, smug, and fashionable ghoul and was also an acquaintance of Rize. Like both Ken and Rize, he is an avid reader. He sometimes says words or phrases in either English, Spanish, French or Italian, and develops an obsession for Ken because of his seemingly unique quality of being human and ghoul. He is very athletic and proficient in martial arts. After being a part of Kaneki's team post-Aogiri he considers himself Kaneki's best friend; at this point it was never clear if he had truly seen Kaneki as more than just food. After the time-skip, Sh≈´ gets devastated with Kaneki's disappearance until he is informed of his new identity as Haise and starts conspiring to have him remember his past, until his family's secret is exposed and his entire clan is put on the CCG's hit list. He is cornered by Kaneki, who apparently attacks him without mercy, but does not give him a fatal blow, allowing him to escape and be rescued by Chie, Yomo, and T≈çka. He later helps out Naki and Miza Kusakari as they are being attacked by investigators. ; : :Played by: Kunio Murai :The manager of Anteiku, also known as the Non-Killing Owl. The name came from him pretending to be the One-Eyed Owl to cover up her behavior and refusing to kill Ghoul Investigators. He is a very kind and reasonable ghoul that provides aid and food to ghouls that are incapable of hunting on their own, such as Hinami. He takes Ken in after he becomes a half-ghoul and teaches him the ways in which ghouls can blend in with humans. He has shown to be able to reform ghouls from their violent ways, like helping both Koma and Kaya find peace among themselves when the two were leading large and hostile ghoul gangs against each other. He has also helped Yomo to let go of his hate and vengeful attitude towards ghoul investigators and is a father figure to T≈çka. He has a mysterious past related to Aogiri and an elusive organization known as V. After Anteiku's secret is exposed and the place is raided by the CCG, he is captured by his daughter, Eto, and given to Kan≈ç for his experiments. He used to go by the name . ; : :Played by: Hiyori Sakurada :Hinami is a 13 to 14-year-old ghoul that came to the 20th ward with her mother after her father was killed by ghoul investigators. She is very shy and quiet, yearning for knowledge as she isn't allowed to go to school. She meets Ken in Anteiku and becomes attached to him after he helps her with reading and the pronunciation of certain kanji characters. She begins living with T≈çka after her mother is killed by Kureo Mado but later goes with Kaneki post Aogiri though she would still visit T≈çka. This is changed in the anime as she does not go with Kaneki and stays with T≈çka instead. She enjoys books from one of Ken's favorite authors, Sen Takatsuki (Eto Yoshimura) and loves learning new things. She is shown to have a heightened sense of smell, even more powerful than regular ghouls. In the sequel she reappears as part of Aogiri Tree known as , and once captured by the CCG, she is put under Haise's care by his request, which is a temporary situation, as Akira intends to have Hinami executed to enact revenge for her father's death. However, a restored Kaneki betrays the CCG in order to rescue her. Her kagune is special among ghouls; unlike most who only have one type, Hinami has two, one from each of her parents. Her kagune include two wing-like growths used as shields from her mother, and two bladed whips from her father. ; : :Played by: Shunya Shiraishi :A ghoul who is a second year student who attends the same university as Ken. He is arrogant and hates it whenever his juniors talk back to him. He is very territorial and is hostile to other ghouls that invade his space. His hunting grounds were stolen from him by Rize after a fight which he lost and he tries to reclaim it after her death, but is stopped by T≈çka. He is a loner and fairly good fighter that even small groups of ghouls tend to avoid. Like T≈çka, he blends in well with human society, he even has a human girlfriend Nishino Kimi (voiced by Yurie Kobori in Japanese and Caitlin Glass in English) who is aware of his ghoul identity, and is well known at the university. After the time skip, he becomes a powerful S~rank ghoul known as , and goes around hunting down and killing CCG investigators as well as other ghouls. He seems to have a great dislike towards both CCG and Aogiri Tree commenting that they are the same and disgusting for creating \\"fake\\" ghouls. He reappears on Rushima Island to confront Kan≈ç but fails to capture him. His kagune is a tail-like formation that wraps around his leg and enhances the strength of his kicks beyond those of his rank. In later chapters, this formation has grown in size and can be used as a separate weapon resembling a bident. ; : :The youngest Executive of Aogiri, and T≈çka's younger brother. He is a troubled and rebellious teenager, and resents his sister's choice to live among humans. However, Kaneki suggests that his true reason for joining Aogiri is to protect his sister from afar. Later in the series, he adopts the identity of Black Rabbit and takes credit for his sister's crimes. He also becomes Hinami's partner after she joins the organization and cares deeply for her, to the point of staging an invasion of Cochlea in order to save her from being executed. Ghouls =Anteiku/Black Goat= A small neighbourhood caf√© in Tokyo's 20th district, Anteiku is run by Ghouls who intend to blend into society. Providing aid and food for ghouls in need, managing the feeding grounds of the ghouls in the 20th Ward, and collecting food for ghouls by searching for the bodies of humans who committed suicide. It becomes Kaneki's home until the place is raided by the CCG in the end of the original series. Almost all of its original staff become core members of Kaneki's Ghoul coalition \\"Black Goat\\", after he assumes the title of One Eyed King. ; : :Played by: Shuntaro Yanagi :Renji is a quiet and reserved ghoul. He is an expert coffee brewer, although he does not work for the shop anymore as his customer service was lackluster, with most describing him as intense. He then began to procure suicide victims for consumption for ghouls who were either too weak or did not wish to hunt for human prey. Before working for Anteiku he used to be violent and temperamental, much like T≈çka from the first series, and would often fight with Uta making the 4th ward uninhabitable. They realized that a battle between them would lead to mutual death, and have been friends since. He also swore revenge on the CCG for killing his older sister but later sees the errors of his ways due to Yoshimura's guidance. He is known to CCG as Raven due to his mask resembling the bird as well as his kagune's pitch black color. Regardless of his cold demeanor he does genuinely care about those around him. He is later seen again with T≈çka, working at the \\":re\\" coffee shop. It's later revealed that he is T≈çka and Ayato's uncle, who kept his identity a secret from them after their parents' deaths, despite watching over them closely since then. His kagune are two massive pitch black wings with a typical ukaku function in firing projectiles. However, he has an extra special ability to fire lightning-like bolts and also conduct electricity. ; : :Played by: Kenta Hamano :An experienced and humorous waiter at Anteiku, frequently acting as manager when Yoshimura is not in. Though he looks harmless, in truth he was once the leader of a violent gang and was called the Devil Ape. He, as well as his friend Kaya, was once a violent and destructive ghoul, and he renounced these ways after Yoshimura's guidance. He emerged from retirement to defend Anteiku as The Devil Ape, leading his old gang of monkey masked ghouls, who once occupied the 20th Ward. The fight leaves him severely wounded and at the Investigator's mercy until he is saved by Kaneki. He escapes through Route V14 with Kaya, and manages to pass by Arima while he was busy fighting Kaneki. His kagune resembles that of a monkey's tail, and is completely prehensile. He uses it not for combat, but rather for repositioning quickly. He is also humorously drawn with a large, bulbous nose. ; : :Played by: Nozomi Sasaki :One of the waitresses at Anteiku, she is a quiet and reserved woman. She was formerly the leader of the dog masked gang Black Dobers and nicknamed the Black Dog prior to encountering Yoshimura, and was rehabilitated by him. Like Enji, she and her old gang come out of retirement, and follow her into battle knowing they will die when CCG raids Anteiku. Presumed to be killed in the occasion, she reappears in the battle of Rushima Island, assisting the ghouls against the CCG. Her kagune resembles dual beetle-like wings with typical ukaku function: firing projectiles. However, her greatest strength lies in her hearing, which she can use to detect location and movement through different sound waves. This ability works without visual aids, and gives Irimi a kind of sixth sense where she can predict attacks as they begin, giving her ample time to counter. =Clowns= The Clowns is a mysterious group responsible for the accident that led to Kaneki receiving Rize's organs. They later appear in the sequel as the proprietors of an auction for wealthy Ghouls to buy humans which is later broken up by the CCG.

Despite his appearance he is a very calm ghoul, and speaks very kindly and amusingly, with a rather aloof personality. He is known to CCG as \\"No Face\\", because of his mask's design. In the past he would often get into fights with Yomo and this caused the 4th ward to become uninhabitable. They realized they would not survive if they fought to death, and have been friends since. He did not reveal his kagune for an exceptionally long time, which was revealed to be duplicating tails. In addition, he possesses a level of regeneration beyond nearly any other ghoul revealed in the series, as well as a unique shapeshifting power that allows him to change his facial features and his voice with near perfect accuracy. He was designed after the Japanese rockstar MIYAVI. ; : :A feminine and flamboyant ghoul and a member of the Clowns and was affiliated with Aogiri Tree while Yamori was alive.

He is considered a valuable source of information on other Ghouls, due to having no loyalty to others. His favorite victims were the orphans he raised. Strangely, he spared Amon after the boy caught him butchering another child. This fact continues to haunt Amon. Once the Cochlea is breached after Haise's betrayal, he manages to escape and rejoin his fellow Clowns. During the Dragon Crisis, Donato is defeated and killed by Amon. =Aogiri Tree= Leader ; : : The founder and leader of Aogiri, she is the half-human daughter of Yoshimura, and the infamous Ghoul known as the and the main antagonist of the original Tokyo Ghoul.

During the breach of Cochlea, Eto manages to escape but is defeated by Furuta, who reveals that he had Kan≈ç perform the ghoul operation on him, and has a final meeting with Kaneki before supposedly dying, satisfied that he has defeated Arima and had become strong enough to become the new One-Eyed King. She is later captured and used as the main body for the Taxidermied Owl. She manages to retrieve herself from the kakuja and returns to life, although her final fate is unknown. Direct Subordinates ; : :The Second-in-Command of Aogiri, a cunning Ghoul with former ties to a group of ghouls known as Chi She Lian, originating in mainland China. He typically does not fight, and mirrors Renji Yomo on Anteiku as he follows his leader (Eto) around as Yomo follows Yoshimura. He never shows emotion and treats all of his subordinates as expendable, unless Ghoul Investigator K≈çsuke H≈çji appears or is even mentioned. This is because Chi She Lian was destroyed in part by H≈çji, who personally killed Tatara's brother and one of his good friends. He first reveals his kagune to be a massive growth with a special pyrokinetic ability. He gravely wounds Seid≈ç Takizawa (H≈çji's partner) in this fight, who is later experimented on and is turned into a psychotic ghoul.

Though considered a major target, she has eluded numerous extermination attempts and uses Nutcracker to obtain \\"ingredients\\" for her organization.

While at first seems harmless, the moment his first partner Shiki Kijima was killed, he revealed his true self and killed Matsumae. He is an alumnus of the Sunlit Garden, an agent of V, and originally was a half-human, but he had Rize's kagune implanted into him in secret with Kan≈ç's help, transforming him into a half-ghoul strong enough to defeat SSS level ghouls like Eto, although if the other agents of V discover his Kagune he could be labeled as a possible target for execution as he performed the procedure in secret. He infiltrated the Clowns under the name , the Ghoul that provoked Rize's accident and collaborated with Dr. Kan≈ç, thus collaborating with Kaneki's transformation into a half-ghoul. His talk with Eto revealed he's also an outcast of the Wash≈´ Clan, something that angers him greatly. Once all other members of the Wash≈´ family are killed, Nimura is instated as the new Bureau Director of the CCG and begins an aggressive campaign to wipe out all Ghouls not affiliated with him in the city, which is a ruse for his true objective, which is to capture Kaneki and use his body to create a massive creature known as the Dragon, which ravages the city of Tokyo, in order to revive Rize. He is ultimately defeated and killed by Kaneki inside the Dragon. =Special Class Investigators= ; : :The protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul: JACK and supporting character in Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re, he is a famed Special Class Ghoul Investigator known as the . He is always seen wearing his glasses, with his face kept in an apathetic expression, rarely showing any emotion if not at all. Arima was hailed as a genius within the CCG, stemming from his affiliation with the organization since his teens and quickly rising to the top. Fighting with multiple quinques, he is strong enough to defeat Ghouls that are too strong to be defeated by anyone else in the force. After defeating Ken, he takes him under his guard while he's under the new identity of Haise Sasaki and becomes his mentor, with orders to kill him should he go out of control. After Kaneki regains his memories and betrays the CCG, Arima confronts him once more, just to be defeated. Kaneki spares his life, but Arima opts to commit suicide instead. Before dying, Arima reveals that he, and all alumni from the Sunlit Garden are half-humans. He also reveals that his life was about to end nonetheless, as his left eye was almost blind due to glaucoma, and asks Kaneki to make it look like he was killed by him, to which he complies. After his death, it is revealed that Arima was the one called by Eto as the , who was conspiring with her all along, waiting for a ghoul strong enough to break the current status-quo imposed by the Wash≈´ Clan to appear, and both died believing that Kaneki had become suited for such role, inheriting both his will to change the world, as well as his title. ; : :Played by: Nobuyuki Suzuki :Amon is a Rank 1 Anti-Ghoul Investigator and was a partner of Kureo Mado up until his death which was when his partner was switched to Akira Mado up until he disappeared.

During his time as an investigator he would sometimes be playfully teased by his late partner Mado, Shinohara and later by Akira after she became his subordinate. As a human he was extremely fond of sweet food but hated anything that was spicy. Despite his initial hatred towards ghouls Amon has shown to be interested in Kaneki's story and even after getting badly injured and losing his arm to Kaneki when they last meet, he refuses to die, so that Kaneki would not be prosecuted. After the events of the first manga, he was declared KIA after facing Tatara in battle when the Aogiri Tree came while the CCG fought against the One Eyed Owl and was posthumously given a double promotion to the rank of Special Class Investigator, but reappears, transformed into a half-ghoul, to protect Akira from Takizawa when he attacks her. He helps Takizawa come back to his senses through their fight, however is captured by the CCG and held in a test tube. He is rescued by Takizawa and later joins Black Goat along with him. For a long while he avoided talking to Akira because he felt guilty about avoiding her for all the years he was listed as MIA, and whenever he did try to talk with Akira, she would shut him down. He does however get the courage he needs to confront her from Touka and they eventually make up. The two have not been seen since Akira decided to leave Black Goat. :He returns during the Dragon Crisis, where he faces against his paternal figure Donato Popora, and despite everything he did to him, Amon still feels saddened after killing him. ; : :A young boy with an androgynous appearance.

He takes in Juzo after he was found by investigators during a raid of one Big Madam's restaurants. He becomes like a father figure to Juzo constantly looking out for him and trying to get him out of trouble. One of the more light hearted investigators, he is also well respected and after Akira becomes a subordinate to Amon, the young investigator seeks advice from him. His quinque is a large butcher knife called the Demon Yamada 1.

He distinguished himself while serving in Germany, eliminating the Rosewald Family and rapidly climbing the ranks. He opposes the existence of the Quinx, and treats Sasaki with disrespect. He's also known for his callous attitude, and his teams taking heavy losses to get the maximum results, seeing them as expendable. Like all members of the Wash≈´ Clan, he is later revealed to be a ghoul disguised as a human. When Matsuri discovers his father's corpse, he vows revenge against Marude, but is attacked by V's assassins, who swore alligeance to Furuta. He is later revealed to have survived the attack, appearing alongside Marude and several other investigators as they manage to oust Furuta from his office. ; : :A Special Class Investigator who is known for his abrasive personality to his subordinates. He is the commander of the 11th Ward Special Countermeasures Unit and Chief of Division II. During the battle against Aogiri Tree on Rushima, Marude exposes the Wash≈´'s secrets of them being ghoul co- conspirators and ghouls. =Associate Special Class Investigators= ; : :Kureo's daughter and a Ghoul Investigator like him, she became K≈çtar≈ç's partner after her father's death. She is an intelligent woman and seems to be always serious about work and her daily routine in general. Like her father, she has deep insight and intuition that helps her in investigation and determining what is going on around her while on the field. After K≈çtar≈ç was declared KIA, she became Haise's team leader and the overseer of the Quinx Squad. Haise has said that she was like a mother to him and Shirazu describes her as the \\"Holy Mother of CCG\\". Despite having high regards for Haise, she is wary of his closeness with Hinami, as she is eager to kill her to enact revenge for her father. Akira is very weak to alcohol and can get drunk after drinking only one glass of it. During the battle on Rushima Island, Akira gets herself gravely injured after shielding Takizawa with her body during his fight with Amon and the Quinx Squad and is taken under care of Kaneki and his allies. After a month of being in a coma, through a combined effort of Banjou and the members of the Great Wheel Act, she finally regained consciousness. However, the reality of her situation has weighted heavily on her mind and she had for a very long time refused to speak with anyone including both Amon; (who had avoided her for all the years he was alive making her believe he was dead) and Kaneki for killing Arima. Eventually due to Touka patching up her relationship with herself, Akira and Hinami, Akira breaks out of her depression though a bit confused and apprehensive and was able to finally speak with the others. She was last seen going off with Amon after deciding to leave Black Goat. :She and Amon eventually return to aid the CCG and Black Goat during the Dragon crisis. ; : :An Associate Special Class Investigator, assigned as the captain of Squad 3 during major operations. He is a deranged individual with little regard for life, whether ghoul or human. Heavily scarred and holding a deeper hatred for Ghouls that is abnormal even for Investigators, his hatred of ghouls comes from Irimi killing many of his allies and scarring him. In the battle against Aogiri, he is assigned as T≈çru Mutsuki's new superior. He ends up sacrificing himself to allow T≈çru and Ayumu escape while he tries to hold off Shikorae and Takizawa. ; : :An Associate Special Class Investigator heavily covered in scars obtained when he was attacked by the ghoul nicknamed Jail.

He is the main antagonist of Tokyo Ghoul: Jail. =First-Class Investigators= ; : :The other protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul: JACK, Taishi is a First Class Ghoul Investigator. Fura, as a teenager, attended Seishin Senior Highschool along with Arima. Though he never liked school, he usually went shopping and did all the housework, since his mother never did. He had two childhood friends; Ry≈ç, with whom he played baseball and Aki, a girl whom he had a crush on. When Ry≈ç associated himself with a gang of bikers, this led to his death, as he was stabbed by the Kagune of a killer ghoul, \\"Lantern,\\" whom Arima was currently investigating. Witnessing his friend's tragic death, Fura grew heated for vengeance, and pleaded with Arima to help with his investigation, wanting to know about ghouls right away. Thus, he eventually undertook the career of Ghoul Investigation. Fura had a minor appearance in Tokyo Ghoul and has appeared in Tokyo Ghoul:re. ; : :Played by: Yo Oizumi :He was a First-Class Investigator and was K≈çtar≈ç Amon's partner and mentor. A very experienced and ruthless fighter, he was more than a challenge even for the physically superior ghoul and always trusted his intuition, which was never wrong. His ultimate downfall came from the fact that he was obsessed with quinques (weapons made from the ghouls' kagune) and while fighting T≈çka and Hinami, he let his guard down by his fascination with the latter, being killed by them. His daughter, Akira, worked with his partner K≈çtar≈ç Amon after his death. His goal was to get revenge on the One-Eyed Owl for killing his wife. Despite his mercilessness towards ghouls, he was a very loving and devoted father, seen when he could have gotten promoted beyond First-Class but decides to decline the promotion because it would mean he would have to face more dangerous adversaries which would increase his chances of dying and leaving his daughter behind, even though such a promotion would have also increased his chances for an encounter with his wife's killer. ; : :A First-Class Investigator, and former partner to Arima. He is in command of the 21st Ward, and an exceptionally skilled fighter. In the sequel his squad is working on the Orochi Case, and is responsible for handling Sasaki should he lose control. He gets transferred to the S3 Squad after the Auction, leaving his squad in the hands of Kuramoto. After Arima's death, he decides to follow his former mentor's last wish by breaking all ties with the CCG in order to help Kaneki escape Cochlea. ; : :A First-Class Investigator, and member of Hirako's team. He is easy-going and cheerful, slowly becoming a good friend to Sasaki and the Quinx. After the Auction, he finds himself suddenly given command of the squad and has misgivings about it. ; : :The junior partner of Hachikawa, and a veteran of the battle in the 20th Ward. She is a small and curious young woman, with her face always hidden by her hair. She turns out to have a very young, freckle- covered face, which embarrasses her. She gets promoted to First-Class Investigator. ; : :A First Class Investigator, alumni of the Sunlit Garden, and partner to K≈çri Ui. At 20 years old, she is much younger than her peers and became an Investigator as a teenager. She is a member of the mysterious Squad Zero, commanded by Arima, and took part in the battle in the 20th Ward. She's killed during the fight with Mairo and Matsumae, when she slips on her own blood, which allows Matsumae to impale her and is then decapitated by Mairo. As later revealed by Arima, Hairu, like all alumni of the Sunlit Garden, is a half-human. =Rank 1 Investigators= ; : :A 20-year old Rank 2 Investigator, and member of Team Hirako. He is the son of Special Class Kuroiwa, and considered to be an exceptionally gifted young Investigator. Kuramoto notes that he is among the 0.01% of humans that possesses physical strength above normal human limitations, and can therefore actually fight Ghouls unarmed. He gets promoted to Rank 1 Investigator. He is a friend of Yoriko Kosaka, unaware of her connection with Touka, and later becomes her husband. ; : :A Rank 1 Investigator and a member of Suzuya Squad. =Rank 2 Investigators= ; : :A Rank 2 Ghoul Investigator that was Akira's classmate and rival at the Academy. Deeply insecure, he had a tendency to bicker with Akira or J≈´z≈ç because of their superior abilities. He deeply admired Amon and defied orders out of concern for his safety, leading him into an ambush by members of Aogiri. He was mortally wounded by Noro, and declared KIA. In Tokyo Ghoul:re, he returns as a major antagonist after being turned into an insane One-Eyed Ghoul by Aogiri. Takizawa's deranged appearance and mindset are made to mirror Ken's, and have made him a manifestation of Haise's fears of what he could one day become should he ever regain his memories. Takizawa turned on the Aogiri by killing Tatara, hoping to be praised as the hero of CCG. Instead, Houji ordered his squad to eliminate him which sent Takizawa into a blind rage, slaughtering all of them. As Takizawa attempts to finish off Akira, Amon appears to stop him. During the fight, Takizawa regains his sanity and ultimately decides to join Black Goat, though the tortures that Aogiri put him through have left him deeply scarred. ; : :A skilled Rank 2 Investigator from the 13th Ward. She comes across as harsh, but in truth has a deep admiration for Amon. Despite trying to get Amon's attention by cooking, her food causes everyone that eats them to suffer food poisoning, though she remains oblivious to being responsible. She refuses to believe Amon is dead because of his missing body. =Quinx Squad= ; : :A Rank 2 Ghoul Investigator who was the Squad Leader of the Quinx Squad until he was replaced with Ginshi, but he regains the post after Ginshi's death. Kuki often displays himself as a cool-headed individual, but is reckless and vicious when confronting Ghouls, as he hates them with a passion, as his father was a special class investigator in charge of the S3 squad, who ordered his team members to retreat while he stayed to fight the One-Eyed Owl to the death. This hate also extended to Haise after he discovered that he is a half-ghoul instead of just a Quinx. He constantly acts reckless when facing ghouls to gain credit from his superiors; he wishes to be the best ghoul investigator ever. After the battle at the auction, he is promoted to Rank 1, and after the battle with Donato, he is promoted to First Class. Initially he was cold toward his comrades and did not care for them, seeing them as a nuisance and as tools for him to use to gain promotion. His obsession with promotion drives him throughout earlier parts of :Re. However after going berserk and nearly killing Mutsuki, he slowly becomes less obsessed and starts to care more about his comrades, especially after Shirazu's death. ; : :A Rank 3 Ghoul Investigator and the Squad Leader of the Quinx Squad. Like most of his teammates, Ginshi is shown to have great respect for Haise. However, this doesn‚Äôt stop him from going out of his way to execute missions without Sasaki's permission, and so he is constantly seen accompanying Urie on dangerous assignments without support. His primary motive for joining the Quinx Squad is to get fast money to treat his sister, who is ill with a rare disease, but his determination to help others earns him Haise's respect, to the point of nominating him as the new leader. After the battle at the auction, he is promoted to Rank 2, but during the ambush at the Tsukiyama Headquarters, he dies from his wounds after confronting and killing Noro from the Aogiri Tree. His body is later stolen by the Aogiri Tree and given to Dr. Kan≈ç for the sake of his research. ; : :A Rank 3 Ghoul Investigator, T≈çru joined the CCG at a young age, the circumstances of which are said to be very mysterious, thus it is unknown if T≈çru is his birth name or a chosen one. T≈çru struggles to keep his one eyed kakugan under control, much like Kaneki did in the past; he suffers from anemia, and also wears an eye patch similar to Kaneki. Ironically, he feels repulsed when he comes in contact with blood. After the battle at the auction, T≈çru receives a double promotion to Rank 1, for putting himself in dire risk in order to grant the success of the operation. After Shirazu's death, T≈çru leaves the Quinx squad and puts his ghoul-like superhuman sense of smell to use in investigations. After being captured and dismembered by Torso on Rue Island, T≈çru finally consciously accepts that he held responsibility, not the ghouls, for the slaughter of her family. Because of this incident, he was taken into the CCG and given the option of undergoing the Quinx operation. He accepts, but requests to live as a man because he has developed insecurities because of the childhood sexual abuse he suffered. It is revealed that he has a habit of torturing animals, and collects tongues in a jar. It is also revealed that during the Auction operation, he had devoured the deceased CCG agents to replenish himself. After this sudden revelation on Rue Island, he brutally butchers and dismembers Torso and escapes. During his work at the CCG, Mutsuki's psychopathic behavior resurfaces, not only because of the torment he suffered, but out of an obsession with Kaneki, for whom he had become in love with. T≈çru slowly slips further and further into madness, and decides to hunt Haise down and exterminate him. ; : :A Rank 3 Ghoul Investigator, Saiko dislikes having to work, as she prefers having a lazy and carefree life, playing video games and eating junk food excessively. She often oversleeps, which earns her the absence from most missions. She has an extremely impressive kagune manipulation ability among the Quinx, but rarely puts it to use because it is exhausting; thus, Haise uses her abilities to strike decisive blows after the rest of the squad have weakened the enemy. After the Auction Operation, she is promoted to Rank 2, and after Shirazu's death, becomes vice-captain of the Quinx squad, assuming a more responsible demeanor, leaving behind her NEET lifestyle, and becoming more professional. ; :He is the nephew of Kiyoko Aura and part of the second batch of Quinx Squad. He is a shy and nervous person and, despite having no special achievements while at the Academy, is expected to have a high potential to be a great investigator. ; :T≈çma came from a wealthy family as is part of the second batch. He is energetic and admires Saiko. ; :A Taiwanese investigator and part of the second batch. She is also an alumnus of the Sunlit Garden and goes by the name of . =Investigator Assistants= ; : :Played by: Kai Ogasawara :Hideyoshi is Ken's best friend, nicknamed \\"Hide\\". He has a sharp intuition, so much so that while Ken tried to keep his ghoul identity hidden from him, Hideyoshi seemed to know something is weird about his best friend. Hide has proven to be intelligent and very observant, even figuring out that Rabbit (T≈çka) was not Hinami like what CCG had first thought. He will also go to extreme lengths for those he cares about, like venturing to Aogiri's hideout and putting a tracking device on the torturous Yamori. After Ken disappeared, Hideyoshi joined the Anti-Ghoul forces in order to learn about his whereabouts, eventually being promoted to Rookie Investigator and partnered with K≈çtar≈ç and Akira. He eventually reunites with Ken and reveals to him that he knows he is Eye Patch, getting himself seriously injured during the raid of Anteiku in the anime and reported to be missing in the manga after speaking to Kaneki, with his fate unknown since then, though it is implied in Tokyo Ghoul: Re that he allowed himself to be consumed by Kaneki in order to have his friend recover for his fight against Arima. He later reappears in some form within Kaneki's mind as a confidant and a physical representation of his compassion. Much later in the sequel, he is revealed to be a misidentified ghoul known as Scarecrow by the CCG. He appears to be leading or at least apart of a terrorist organization whose only goal so far has been to re-take the CCG from Furuta. Other characters ; : :A human photographer and information broker. She is a long- time friend of Sh≈´ Tsukiyama, aware of his secret but uninterested in exposing him as a Ghoul. At his request, she serves as an informant to Kaneki's group. She seeks out the members of the Quinx Squad, and offers to sell them information pertaining to Torso. This is because she has an unusual interest in their leader, Sasaki. Despite being the same age as Shuu, she looks like an elementary school student. She has an oddly unique way of seeing the world, always looking for a good picture; she sees things rather impartially and she almost never shows fear. ; : :Played by: Seika Furuhata; Nana Mori :A human who was T≈çka's best friend when they attended Kiyomi High School together.

Attack The attacks happened during the evening while the soldiers were breaking their fast to eat during Ramadan. At 7:40 p.m., 60 militants divided in two groups simultaneously ambushed two checkpoints which were set up by the military to control the Chaambi Mountains region. The militants shot from many angles using rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Five soldiers died of their wounds and nine burned to death when their tent caught fire. Twenty others were injured and the wounded were taken to a hospital in Kasserine. Another soldier went missing but his body was found the next day around a kilometer from the site of the initial clashes, raising the death toll to 15. Tunisia's Defense Minister Ghazi Jeribi said that the attackers infiltrated the region from the borders with Algeria and that the assailants included Tunisians, Algerians and \\"foreign mercenaries\\". One of them was killed and was identified as a Tunisian jihadist. Reactions =Domestic= President Moncef Marzouki announced a three-day period of mourning for the country and ordered flags to be flown at half mast. Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa condemned the attacks and vowed they would not go unpunished. He said that they gave a bad image to an \\"open and tolerant Tunisia\\" and were aimed at obstructing the country's democratic process. Jomaa announced a crackdown on terrorism by strengthening of border control and all networks recruiting fighters for jihad in other countries, most notably Syria. Land forces chief, Maj. Gen. Souhail Chmangi said that this is a state of \\"open warfare\\". The incident also drew condemnation by most of Tunisia's political movements. Many criticized the government for its failure to prevent such attack and the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) for not drafting a law that would equip the country well enough to fight the threat of terrorism. As a result, members of the NCA held a debate the following day. where fifteen articles of the draft counter-terrorism law were ratified. \\"People accuse the NCA of procrastination in drafting the terrorism law, and we are not,‚Äù said Kalthoum Badr Eddine, the commission's president. B√©ji Ca√Ød Essebsi, leader of Nidaa Tounes, delivered a statement following the attacks. \\"The war against terrorism requires a strong, national political union which contrasts with the previously adopted strategies driven primarily by laxity and procrastination,\\" he said. Popular Front spokesman Hamma Hammami said that Tunisia is \\"now paying the price for ideological, [...] political, and legislative laxity\\". Some Islamist groups also condemned the attacks. Ridha Belhaj, spokesman of Hizb ut-Tahrir, said: \\"We consider this attack to be criminal and treacherous. What is more dangerous than the act itself is its timing. [...] Every time there is a political crisis, a similar incident occurs\\". On its Facebook page, Ennahdha called on political forces, national organizations, and all supporters of freedom in Tunisia to participate in a march after Friday prayers the next day. =International= * - Egypt denounced the terrorist attacks through a statement by the Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdel-Atti. He said that \\"terrorism is a global phenomenon and not related to a specific religion or nation,\\" adding that it is important to rally regional and international efforts to confront its threat. * ‚Äì The French government condemned the attack and the Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal reiterated his country's support to the Tunisian government in its fight against terrorism. \\"We express our condolences to the families of the victims,\\" he added. * - King Abdullah II phoned both Tunisia and Egypt's presidents, due to a similar attack in Egypt two days later, offering them his condolences and condemning \\"such cowardly terrorist acts\\".

Oxford City Police CID, Cowley Station =Detective Constable (DC) Endeavour Morse= Background and Personality The protagonist and main character of the series. Endeavour Morse, played by Shaun Evans, is a twenty-eight-year-old Detective Constable in the Oxford City Police's CID at Cowley Police Station, Oxford. Endeavour grew up in Lincolnshire. His father was a taxi driver and his mother, Constance, died when Endeavour was twelve years old in 1950 when she was twenty nine. His father married a woman named Gwen, whose daughter Joyce \\"Joycie\\" is Endeavour's step-sister. Endeavour left Lonsdale College at Oxford University late in his third year without taking a degree as a result of breaking up with a woman from Jericho named Susan. Endeavour spent a short time in the Royal Corps of Signals as a cipher clerk before joining the Carshall-Newtown Police. After spending two years as a Police Constable, Endeavour is transferred to CID as a Detective Constable. In the pilot episode of the series, Morse transfers to the Oxford City Police's CID in 1965 following the coaxing of the Oxford City Police's Cowley Station \\"guv\\", veteran DI Fred Thursday, after the young Endeavour successfully solves a double murder case. Throughout the series, Endeavour expresses doubts in staying with the police, and in the Series 2 finale, expresses a desire to possibly leave the force and become a teacher abroad. Endeavour is highly intelligent and possesses a wealth of knowledge on Oxford and English history, opera and classical music. His favourite opera singer is Rosalind Calloway, a killer whom he helped capture and who ultimately took her own life in the pilot episode. A non-smoker, Morse initially was a teetotaler, before being given a pint of ale by Thursday following his fainting at the sight of an autopsy. By the second series, Morse increased his level of alcohol consumption, particularly in spirits. Morse does not believe in an afterlife. In the episode \\"Nocturne\\", he discusses his belief that \\"death is the end\\", because he \\"saw enough of it.\\" Series 1 While with the Oxford City Police, Morse is taken under the wing of veteran Inspector Thursday. Thursday names Endeavour his designated \\"bag man\\" and shows him the ropes as Morse begins to solve a string of complex murders, much to the envy and annoyance of some of his superiors, particularly Detective Sergeant Peter Jakes and Police Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright. Thursday and Morse's fellow officer, Police Constable Strange, try to steer the young Endeavour into taking his Sergeant's exam, so that he may be relieved of \\"General Duties\\" and become Thursday's official \\"bag man\\" with the appropriate rank and title of a Sergeant. In the final episode of Series 1, Morse is shot during an investigation, around the same time that his father dies. Morse is then put on \\"light duty\\" for several months at Oxfordshire (County) Police's Whitney Station, under D.I. Bart Church. Series 2 Upon returning to Cowley Station in 1966, Morse is received warmly by Chief Superintendent Bright and Sergeant Jakes, as Inspector Thursday begins to keep a more watchful eye on the young Endeavour. As a result of the shooting, Morse begins to suffer from delayed stress and paranoia, as well as an increase in alcohol consumption at local pubs and in his own city flat. Upon return to active duty, Morse is confronted first by three cases, which he tries to tie in together. Morse makes several mistakes in the investigation, but despite his errors, he solves the cases, impressing his superiors. During the investigation of one case, he is beaten into a concussion and is cared for by his nurse neighbour, Monica Hicks, who becomes his love interest during Series 2. D.I. Thursday's daughter, Joan, begins to take a romantic interest in Endeavour, although unrequited. Morse solves several more complex murder cases and in the series finale, Morse and Thursday are called upon by Assistant Chief Constable Deare to investigate corruption within the Oxford City and Oxfordshire Police forces. After investigating several cases leading to the pillars of Oxford society, the finale of Series 2 ends with Thursday's being shot by ACC Deare, who is in fact the head of the corruption, who succeeds in framing Endeavour for his murder of the Chief Constable and the bilking of evidence. Morse is arrested and placed in a jail cell. Series 4 In the first episode Morse learns that he has failed his sergeant exams because his papers went missing. Chief Bright suggests that some of Morse‚Äôs enemies might be sabotaging his career and advises him to leave Oxford. Morse, however, decides to stay. After having received a call from her, Morse locates Joan in Leamington and asks her to come home which she refuses. In the final episode Morse receives a job offer in London and he considers leaving Oxford. Joan visits Morse when she is hit and kicked out by her boyfriend. He asks her to marry him, which she refuses, and he gives her some money to help her out. Later, Morse is notified when Joan is admitted to hospital following a miscarriage. Having averted a disaster at a nuclear power plant along with Thursday, Morse is awarded the George Medal and promoted detective sergeant in the series finale. =Detective Inspector (DI) Frederick Albert Thursday= Background and Personality Fred Thursday is a veteran Detective Inspector and World War II veteran portrayed by Roger Allam. Thursday served in the North African and Italian Campaigns during the war as a soldier in the British Expeditionary Force after becoming a policeman in London in December 1938. Thursday married his wife, Win, in November 1941, with whom he has two children in their early twenties: Joan and Sam. Thursday is one of the more noble and honourable figures in the series and takes the young Endeavour under his wing, clearly seeing Endeavour's high level of intelligence when it comes to police work. Thursday also keeps Endeavour in line and tries to protect him. Thursday is also highly protective of his family and always avoids corruption and does his best to do what is right and decent. Thursday never talks about his work at home with his family, preferring to \\"leave work...on the hall stand by the front door\\". In the pilot episode, after seeing to the removal of a corrupt Detective Sergeant, Thursday persuades young Endeavour Morse to transfer out of the Carshall-Newtown Police and join the Oxford City Police, saying that \\"The world is long on academics, Morse, but we're short a good detective\\". In the original script for the pilot, the character was called DI Bernard Stokes. Series 1 In the first series, Thursday names Morse his designated \\"bag man\\", much to the chagrin of DS Jakes and to the annoyance of the very procedural CS Bright. In the second episode, Thursday tries to get Morse to accept \\"General Duties\\" until he can pass his sergeants exam and be given more leeway, explaining to Morse that he needs more experience by saying he was a good detective, \\"...but a poor policeman. No one can teach you the first, but any fool can learn the second\\". Still, Thursday tries to convince CS Bright of Morse's obvious intelligence and superiority to make his superiors more accepting of the young Endeavour. In the series finale, it is revealed that Thursday was originally an officer in the Metropolitan Police Service in London during the earlier half of his career, but relocated himself and his family to Oxford and transferred to the Oxford City Police after an officer working under his wing in London was killed in a beating gone too far by East London gangsters, aiming to take revenge upon Thursday. Thursday then saves Morse's life by shooting and killing a murderer who shot Morse. Series 2 In the second series, Thursday displays more of a fatherly role toward Morse and explains his worry for the young detective to his wife, Win, particularly when Morse begins to show signs of delayed stress and increased alcohol consumption. Thursday and Morse solve several complex cases together. In the third episode, it is revealed that shortly after he was married, during the Italian Campaign of WWII, Thursday had a love affair with a young Italian girl who he thought was murdered by the Nazis. When she surfaces as a department store clerk in Oxford, Thursday begins seeing the woman again, but does not engage in any impropriety. The woman kills herself due to grief in betraying her family during the war, which crushes Thursday who still loved her despite being married. In the Series 2 finale, Morse and Thursday are called upon by ACC Deare to investigate rampant corruption within the Oxford City Police, the Oxfordshire (County) Police, and the Town Hall. At the same time, as part of streamlining in the Thames Valley Police merger, Bright suggests that Thursday either retires or becomes a Training Officer, in part due to his age and high blood pressure. Thursday mulls the idea over. Finally, in a set up headed by ACC Deare, the head of the corruption, Thursday is shot in the chest trying to rescue a young boy who witnessed a murder and was ultimately kidnapped by corrupt officers. Thursday's last few lines include his affirmation that it is not about him, but about the people he is sworn to protect and serve. Thursday ends his affirmation before being shot by saying to Morse, \\"I was born a copper, and I'll die one.\\" Morse administers to the critically wounded Thursday until an ambulance arrives. The episode ends with Thursday's family waiting in their home for the phone to ring, bringing news of Thursday's condition. The finale ends with no news as to Thursday's condition, which appears grave, or as to whether or not he lives or dies. Series 3 In the third series, it is shown Thursday has survived his ordeal, though it has adversely affected both his physical and mental health. He successfully encourages Morse to return to Oxford City Police following Morse's incarceration. Series 4 In season 4, Thursday is dealing with his daughter Joan's departure and his wife's subsequent depression. When Bright is taken ill, Thursday acts up as senior officer of the station, but does not enjoy administrative or political tasks, and is relieved when Bright returns. In S4E4 \\"Harvest\\", Thursday receives the George Medal for gallantry and is promoted to Detective Chief Inspector. =Detective Sergeant (DS) Peter Jakes= Background and Personality Peter Jakes is the Detective Sergeant working under Fred Thursday and is played by Jack Laskey. Jakes works diligently as a policeman, trying to earn his keep and impress Thursday. However, Jakes can be seen as somewhat unscrupulous and vindictive and often puts up a front of bravado to try and impress his superiors and women at the local pubs with his exploits. Series 1 Jakes is on-and-off the antagonist of the first series, displaying jealousy, anger, and contempt toward Endeavour, who although a lower rank than Jakes, is picked by Thursday to be his \\"bag man\\". Jakes and Morse clash on many occasions during the first series. In the final episode of Series 1, Jakes takes Thursday's daughter Joan out dancing and attempts to fondle her on the dance floor, at which time Joan refuses and Jakes quickly leaves at the sight of Thursday entering the club. In exchange for not telling Thursday about his date with Joan, Jakes proposes helping Morse cheat on the upcoming sergeant's exam. Series 2 In the second series, after Morse returns to active duty following his being shot, Jakes seems to no longer be jealous toward Morse and no longer picks on him, believing him to have earned his keep. Instead the two work together and Morse respects Jakes' rank. In the Series 2 finale, it is revealed that in the mid-1950s as a child, Jakes stayed at a home for wayward boys in Kidlington called Blenheim Vale, where he was nicknamed \\"Little Pete\\" by the other boys. Only staying a short time, Jakes was one of many boys who were the victims of sexual and physical assault by the \\"guv\\" of Blenheim Vale (now Alderman Wintergreen), a young Oxfordshire police officer (now Assistant Chief Constable Deare), and several other adult men in charge of the home. As a result of this background, Jakes has a breakdown and drinks himself into a stupor at the end of the episode. Series 3 At the beginning of Series 3, Morse's sabbatical means that Jakes is working more closely with DI Thursday. When Morse returns, it is apparent that Jakes considers Morse an equal and a friend, although he still good-naturedly pulls rank on Morse during their rescue of a kidnap victim in episode two. Jakes leaves at the end of the episode, as he is emigrating to the USA with his girlfriend, a doctoral student from Wyoming, who is expecting a baby. Morse gives him a parting gift of premium bonds \\"for the child\\". In the original script for the pilot, the character was called DS Kevin Ames. Oxford City Police, Cowley Station =Chief Superintendent (CS) Reginald Bright= Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Bright is the Police Chief Superintendent, or head of the Oxford City Police's Cowley Station, who reports to the Assistant Chief Constable and the Chief Constable of the Oxford City Police. He is portrayed by Anton Lesser. Russell Lewis, creator of the series, said: Bright is somewhat oblivious and is considered to be an \\"old school\\" police officer, very worried about appearances and courtesies when dealing with royalty or the Oxford elite, and at first, like Sgt. Jakes, is jealous and very contemptuous toward Morse, despite the young detective's obvious intelligence. Bright suggests to Thursday that it is bad practice to enlist a DC as his bagman, but soon comes to better appreciate young Endeavour by the second series, after he returns from being shot and solving several complex cases. In the original script for the pilot, the character was called Chief Superintendent Rupert Cavendish. =Police Constable (PC) James \\"Jim\\" Strange= Constable Strange is one of many Police Constables in the Oxford City Police and is portrayed by Sean Rigby. Morse and Strange meet in the pilot episode and immediately become friends. At the end of series 1, Strange takes the police exam to become a Sergeant, but at the beginning of series 2 it is revealed that he failed. In series 2, Strange is invited to become a freemason, and accepts, despite Morse's disapproval. At the beginning of series 3, Strange is promoted to Sergeant, and in the third episode he moves from uniform to CID, replacing DS Jakes as Morse's immediate superior. After the closure of Cowley Station, Strange falsely claims Morse to be a brother Freemason in order to get him transferred back to CID.In requesting DCC Bottoms' approval of Morse's transfer back from uniform in Woodstock, DS Strange asserts that Morse is a brother of \\"one of the college lodges, I believe.\\" Episode 6.1, \\"Pylon\\". =Woman Police Constable (WPC) Shirley Trewlove= W.P.C. Trewlove, played by Dakota Blue Richards, joins the Oxford City Police at the Cowley Police Station in Series 3, Episode 2. She is an efficient and effective investigator and swiftly gains Morse's praise. Chief Superintendent Bright sees her as an attractive addition to the station. Given the 1960s setting to the stories, Trewlove is sometimes treated in a condescending manner by visiting detectives and those under investigation. In a similar way to Joan Thursday, Shirley Trewlove develops a distant yet romantic fondness for Morse which he fails to reciprocate. In Series 5 she quietly starts to see D.C. George Fancy, and is observed by Morse. She is obviously deeply affected at the end of the series when D.C. Fancy dies in gang-war crossfire. Thursday's Family =Joan Thursday= Joan Thursday is Inspector Thursday's daughter. She is in her early to mid-twenties and works at a bank in Oxford. She is portrayed by Sara Vickers. In the original script for the pilot, the character was originally called Jackie Stokes. Series 1 Joan is introduced in the second episode of Series 1 and in the final episode of Series 1, goes out on a date with DS Jakes, who takes her to the Moonlight Rooms nightclub in Oxford. While dancing, Jakes fondles Joan, who brushes him off and is escorted home by Morse. Series 2 Beginning in Series 2, upon his return to the Oxford City Police following several months of light duty, Joan begins taking a romantic interest in the young Endeavour. However, her interest is unreciprocated. Series 3 In the Series 3 finale, the bank where Joan works is robbed and she is taken hostage, along with the other employees. When she tries to save Morse from the robbers, one of her colleagues is shot and dies for which Joan blames herself. Subsequently, she decides to leave Oxford. Series 4 In \\"Lazaretto\\" Morse locates Joan in Leamington where she is in a relationship with a married man. When her father visits her in \\"Harvest\\", she tells him she does not want to go back to Oxford, to the life she has led before. Things sour when Thursday roughs her partner up and threatens him. When her boyfriend hits her and kicks her out, Joan visits Morse at his flat. He asks her to marry him, which she refuses. He then lends her some money to help her. Later, Morse gets a call when Joan is admitted to hospital. He visits her and learns from a doctor that she has fallen and has had a miscarriage. Series 5 In the first episode, \\"Muse\\", Morse runs into Joan in Oxford. She has returned and is living apart from her parents. In the final episode, Morse asks Joan out for a coffee. =Winifred Thursday= Winifred Thursday, commonly called Win, is Inspector Thursday's wife and the mother of Joan and Sam Thursday. Win married Fred Thursday in November, 1941 before he was shipped out to Africa. She is played by Caroline O'Neil. =Sam Thursday= Sam Thursday is Inspector Thursday's son, portrayed by Jack Bannon, who has a job in Oxford but is preparing to serve in the British Army. =Charlie Thursday= Charlie Thursday is Inspector Thursday's brother, who runs a long firm scam, using a loan provided by the Inspector, potentially incriminating him. = Paulette Thursday = Paulette Thursday is Charlie's wife, portrayed by Linette Beaumont. First seen in Series 5, Episode 2, Cartouche, when Charlie and his family visit Fred's family in Oxford. = Carol Thursday = Carol Thursday is Charlie and Paulette's daughter, portrayed by Emma Rigby. She appears to be a similar age to her cousin, Joan. First seen in Series 5, Episode 2, Cartouche, when Charlie and his family visit Fred's family in Oxford. Home Office =Dr. Max DeBryn= Dr. Max DeBryn is the Home Office Pathologist responsible for aiding the Oxford City Police in identification of dead bodies recovered, as well as postmortem on the bodies. Dr. DeBryn remains the pathologist for Thames Valley police in the first seven episodes of Inspector Morse. Dr DeBryn in one episode is clearly shaken by a murder of a child and confides in Morse to \\"Find this piece of work\\" showing his faith in the young detective. Other Characters =Dorothea Frazil= Dorothea Frazil is the editor of the Oxford Mail Newspaper. Since the pilot episode, she has been portrayed by Abigail Thaw. Ms. Frazil helps Morse and the Oxford City Police with information pertaining to many different cases. The name \\"Frazil\\" is a pun on Frazil ice vs. thaw. =Monica Hicks= Monica Hicks is a nurse of Jamaican descent who lives in the same house as Morse. She becomes the young Endeavour's love interest in the second series after caring for him when he suffered a concussion. Their romance appears to have ended when Morse was sent to jail at the end of series 2, though they remain friends after his release. Monica is portrayed by Shvorne Marks. =Detective Inspector (DI) Bart Church, Oxfordshire Police CID= D.I. Church is the \\"guv\\" of the Oxfordshire (County) Police's Witney Station CID and was supervising Morse during his several months of \\"light duty\\" following his shooting.

It was produced and distributed by Metro Pictures and directed by Frank Reicher. This picture is preserved at the BFI National Film and Television archive in London. Plot As described in a film magazine, Nita (Dana), in order to escape marrying Pedro Lupo (Blue), vainly calls for help and Bob Armstrong (Ferguson), who once before had rescued Nita from Pedro, again plays the hero. However, through the father of Pedro, a wrong light is placed upon this brave act such that Bob is forced to marry Nita. As Nita is of poor parentage while Bob is the son of a millionaire sent out west to gain his manhood, the match does not strike Bob as being a choice one, but the point of a pistol has considerable to do with his acquiescing. Nita is placed in a convent but escapes and, in the garb of a boy, seeks employment at the ranch where Bob is living. When found in the arms of her husband, the owner of the ranch, Clara Hawkins (Chapman), unaware of the inside facts, sends Nita away. Later explanations come and Nita turns out to be a child of Hawkins whom she thought had died at childbirth. When love enters the heart of Bob, Nita finds happiness.

It is widespread in eastern Africa, with isolated populations in southern Africa and Nigeria. The species is named for the fine down (pubi -) that covers the main leaf veins (-nervia). Habit and habitat It often has a colonial ecology, growing to relatively large shrubs of some 4 to 5 metres tall in full understorey shade. It is native to riparian or middle to low altitude evergreen forests, in warm and humid climes. Description The pale brownish bark is covered with lenticels. The opposite and narrowly elliptic leaves are around 20 cm long, with pubescent veins and entire margins. The two-lipped flowers emerge from the reddish-fringed, green bracts on axillary spikes along the upper sides of branches. It flowers during the drier season, November to December in Nigeria, and June to July in South Africa, though probably all- year at more tropical or subtropical latitudes. The beaked and oblong woody fruit are c.18 mm long. Reproduction The large, dark pink to maroon corollas attract forest sunbirds as pollinators, including Southern double- collared, Collared, Grey and Olive sunbirds. Reproduction occurs in various ways. Seed is produced for a month or so after flowering, producing seedlings that are ready to benefit from rains at the start of the wet season. Suckers develop where plants are damaged, to form new plants. Where stems touch the soil, they may also root to establish new plants. Range In South Africa it is known since April 2000 to occur in Krantzkloof Nature Reserve, KwaZulu- Natal, but is also cultivated in gardens. In Nigeria it is known since November 2002 to occur in the 8 km¬≤ Leinde Fadale forest, situated at 1,600 to 1,670 metres in the uplands adjacent to Gashaka Gumti National Park. It is besides native to montane Southern Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia, the mountain chains of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (up to 2,000 metres) and the Albertine Rift of Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Zambia (1,000 to 1,200 m.a.s.l). No intraspecific variation is evident. Status Though habitat degradation occurs locally, the species as a whole is not threatened.

The three online platforms hipages Group oversees includes; hipages, which operates in the home improvement space; Pet Pages, which operates in the pet services sector; and Natural Therapy Pages, which operates in the domain of natural therapies.  History  hipages was founded in 2004 by co-Chief Executive Officers, David Vitek and Roby Sharon-Zipser. Prior to hipages, Vitek worked as an electrical engineer at IBM and Sharon-Zipser worked for PWC, then later started his own business advisory firm. The initial focus of Vitek and Sharon-Zipser's company stemmed from their recognised value in building a simple system for connecting local businesses with consumers. Their first business venture was Natural Therapy Pages; a directory for consumers and promotional tool for health practitioners. Vitek and Sharon-Zipser then realised the potential their services had in the home improvement space and started Home Improvement Pages, which became hipages in April 2011. The initial focus of the company was on natural therapies until the co-founders realised the potential their services had in the home improvement sector. By 2013, over one million visitors were navigating to the hipages site, with over 40,000 tradies already listed on the directory. In the same year, hipages entered into a partnership with IKEA to assist consumers in locating tradesmen to install their kitchen benches and cabinets. In 2014, Ashok Jacob-led Ellerston Capital acquired a 14% stake in the business, and in December, 2015 News Corp Australia acquired a 25% stake; the biggest investment for the company to date. These two significant investments increased hipages value to over $100 million with a growth rate of 30% year-on-year. Along the way, other investments came from KTM Capital, Right Click Capital and Kresta Capital. To date, hipages has raised over $50 million in funding. Today, hipages facilitates over 100,000 jobs posted by customers each month, with over 1.5 million monthly visitors to the website. Over 135,000 professional tradesmen are listed on the platform offering services across 1,300 home improvement categories. By the end of the 2017 financial year, hipages generated $2 billion worth of work for Australian tradespeople making the website the number one site for finding and hiring tradespeople in Australia. Currently, hipages operates in both Sydney and Manila, with over 150 employees in each office. Vitek and Sharon-Zipser extended hipages to the Philippines in November 2014. =Directors and officers= Karl Cope, who was the chief financial officer and company secretary, resigned on 5 October 2018. Robert Sharon-Zipser then worked as the interim chief financial officer and company secretary, until 8 November 2018, when Melissa Fahey commenced as the chief financial officer and company secretary. David Vitek resigned as CEO on 30 April 2019, with Sharon-Zipser taking over the position on the same day. On 21 March 2019, Heith Mackay-Cruise stepped down as chair, and the position is currently vacant. Stacey Brown was appointed to the board on 21 March 2019. Financials In 2019, the total revenue and other income for hipages Group was $44,907,038 versus $44,329,187 in 2018.

Services  The hipages Group owns and operates three online service directories across three different industries; home improvements, pet services and natural therapies.

Natural Therapy Pages features relevant health, nutrition and naturopathy articles along with a robust directory linking consumers to treatment facilities, doctors, practitioners and other natural therapy providers in the health and wellness space. In 2020 the website began offering bookings for online consultations with practitioners in response to COVID-19. = Pet Pages = The Pet Pages website is a directory service that allows consumers to find local pet services and businesses in their area.

Now Ben is a successful professional writer in a personally distant relationship with his wife Claire. Lulu leaves her treatment facility and seeks out a reluctant Ben to reveal that fifteen years ago they had a child whom she placed in adoption. Determined to meet him on his fifteenth birthday, Lulu asks Ben to join her on a cross country road trip to find their son. Bound at first by his need to protect Lulu from herself, Ben's uncertainty about the free-spirited Lulu is replaced with tender memories of their love affair and her vulnerable health. As they journey, Ben's current life is shared through Claire, who has flown out to intercept the pair. Tensions between the three culminate with Claire telling Lulu about Ben and Claire's son who died the year before. A shaken Lulu calls to Ben, with Claire present, to open up about his son who died and the son they are about to meet. All three characters connect, and in the process, Ben rediscovers his heart.

From Onanole, it travels southeast before turning south and passing through the community of Scandinavia. The road then continues south for before reaching the village of Clanwilliam, intersecting PR 357 near Hilltop and eastbound PR 265 just north of Clanwilliam. After leaving Clanwilliam, PR 262 continues for to meet PTH 16A (Main Street) in Minnedosa, passing Minnedosa Lake which is located northeast of the town centre. Along the way, the road meets eastbound PR 471 just south of Clanwilliam. PR 262 is known as 2nd Avenue S.E. once it enters Minnedosa's town limits. PTH 16A and PR 262 continue in concurrence south from Minnedosa for , using Main Street, 3rd Avenue S.W., and 1st Street S.W. within the town limits, to meet PTH 16, where PTH 16A ends. PR 262 continues south for to meet eastbound PR 465. From PR 465, the road continues south for before turning west and traveling to its southbound terminus. The route is gravel for most its length, with a paved section connecting PR 265 north of Clanwilliam and Minnedosa along with the concurrence it shares with PTH 16A to PTH 16 south of Minnedosa.  History  The section of PR 262 between its southern terminus and PTH 16/16A was the original configuration for PTH 10 before its current section was constructed and opened to traffic in 1962. From the time it was first designated in 1966 until the early 1990s, this section was a narrow paved road with several sharp inclines and declines. In the early 1990s, the road was widened, the inclines and declines smoothed out, and the surface was replaced with gravel. As well, the southern terminus was reconfigured to meet PTH 10 and PTH 24 directly using the old PTH 24 extension. Prior to this, PR 262 met PTH 10 approximately south of its current southern terminus. Also in the early 1990s, the Manitoba government decommissioned a number of provincial secondary roads and returned the maintenance of these roads back to the rural municipalities. A small portion of the original PR 262 was included in this decommissioning. However, unlike most provincial roads in which the length was shortened or the route decommissioned altogether, PR 262 was slightly lengthened from its original distance. Prior to this, PR 262's northern terminus was at the southeastern boundary of Riding Mountain National Park, where the road continued as Rolling River Road before meeting PTH 19 within the park limits. From Scandinavia, it turned east from a 'T' junction with PR 263, traveling in a northeasterly direction for approximately to its former northbound terminus. This section is now a municipal road. After the decommissioning of the original section, PR 262 was rerouted onto the former PR 263, which was decommissioned in its entirety. PR 262 travels to its current northbound terminus on this section. The original length of PR 262 was .

These cadet corps were mainly in secondary and public schools, until 1942 when the Army Cadet Force came into being. By the middle of the 1930s, Certificate \\"A\\" was the aim of every new cadet. Scope of training To obtain the certificate, both military and fitness tests had to be passed. In 1942, the military test consisted of: * Drill * Weapon training * Range Work requiring a minimum score with .22 rifle * Map reading * Command, including drill commands * Battle drill (elementary 7 tactical exercises) The fitness tests varied according to local facilities, but included running; rope work,; wall climbing; an endurance test; water ability (either swimming or treading water). Some units had more tests but these were not listed on the reverse of the certificate. Award The certificate award was often made at a parade of the cadet's unit and consisted of the certificate and a four- pointed star with a red centre to be sewn on the lower sleeve.

In its role of supporting the LCMS, the LCMS Foundation provides investment management services and donor counseling for bequests, endowments, charitable gift annuities, donor advised funds, and other charitable trust funds. History The LCMS Foundation was established on December 8, 1958 for the purpose of receiving gifts of property and other non-cash assets on behalf of the LCMS. The Foundation was led by Rev. E. R. Bertermann, who served as its first executive director. At first, the LCMS Foundation received subsidies from the LCMS. However, beginning in 1968 the LCMS Foundation became self- sustaining. Beginning in 1979, the LCMS Foundation assisted in raising direct gifts to purchase property and construction of a new headquarters for the LCMS. This building, located in Kirkwood, Missouri, is known as the LCMS International Center. The 1981 LCMS Convention created for the first time the position of president to oversee the LCMS Foundation. The Foundation president also served as Vice‚ÄìPresident, Finance/Treasurer of the LCMS. Dr. Norm Sell jointly held these positions of Foundation President and Vice‚ÄìPresident, Finance/Treasurer of the LCMS until 1992 when the positions were split as a result of the 1992 Synod convention. In 2001 the LCMS Foundation switched from managing its own investments to employing Wilshire Associates to assist in locating outside fund managers to do the investing. From 2000 to 2013 the LCMS Foundation provided development services to The LCMS, KFUO Radio, LCMS Joint Seminary Fund, LCMS World Mission, LCMS World Relief and Human Care, Lutheran Housing Support, and the Concordia University System. Beginning in 2013, all direct gift fund raising activity was done directly by the LCMS. = Executive Directors and Presidents = *E. R. Bertermann *Fred Precht *J. David Heino *Otto A.

Today, religious violence in Nigeria is dominated by the Boko Haram insurgency, which aims to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria. Background Nigeria was amalgamated in 1914, only about a decade after the defeat of the Sokoto Caliphate and other Islamic states by the British, which were to constitute much of Northern Nigeria. The aftermath of the First World War saw Germany lose its colonies, one of which was Cameroon, to French, Belgian and British mandates. Cameroon was divided in French and British parts, the latter of which was further subdivided into southern and northern parts. Following a plebiscite in 1961, the Southern Cameroons elected to rejoin French Cameroon, while the Northern Cameroons opted to join Nigeria, a move which added to Nigeria's already large Northern Muslim population. The territory comprised much of what is now Northeastern Nigeria, and a large part of the areas affected by the present and past insurgencies. Following the return of democratic government in 1999, the Muslim-dominated northern Nigerian states have introduced Sharia law, including punishments against blasphemyAmnesty International.

Several incidents have occurred whereby people have been killed for or in response to perceived insults to Islam. History Religious conflict in Nigeria goes as far back as 1953, and in the case of the town of Tafawa Balewa, to 1948. The Igbo massacre of 1966 in the North that followed the counter-coup of the same year had as a dual cause the Igbo officers' coup and pre-existing (sectarian) tensions between the Igbos and the local Muslims. This was a major factor in the Biafran secession and the resulting civil war. The 1980s saw an upsurge in violence due to death of Mohammed Marwa (\\"Maitatsine\\") (see below). In the same decade, the erstwhile military ruler of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Babangida enrolled Nigeria in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. This was a move which aggravated religious tensions in the country, particularly among the Christian community.Holman, Michael (24 February 1986) \\"Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify\\", Financial Times, In response, some in the Muslim community pointed out that certain other African member states have smaller proportions of Muslims, as well as Nigeria's diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Since the return of democracy to Nigeria in 1999, Sharia has been instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in 9 Muslim-majority and in some parts of 3 Muslim-plurality states, when then-Zamfara State governor Ahmad Rufai Sani began the push for the institution of Sharia at the state level of government. =1980s= In the 1980s, serious outbreaks between Christians and Muslims occurred in Kafanchan in southern Kaduna State in a border area between the two religions, propagated by extreme leaders who were able to rally a young, educated group of individuals who were feared that the nation would not be able to protect their religious group.Jibrin Ibrahim, \\"Politics of religion in Nigeria: The Parameters of the 1987 Crisis in Kadana State', Review of African Political Economy, 45 (1989), 65-82. pp. 65‚Äì68, https://www.jstor.org/stable/4006011, accessed on 01/11/2011 The leaders were able to polarize their followers through speeches and public demonstrations.Ibrahim, p. 65 The activities of some of these sects has in recent times led to the loss of lives and properties as they move about destroying government facilities which they see as legacies or replica of western cultures in their various communities. These religious campaigns has seen an increase in gun battles between the members of these sects and security forces with loss of lives witnessed on both sides. Although direct conflicts between Christians and Muslims were rare, tensions did flare between the two groups as each group radicalised. There were clashes in October 1982 when Muslim zealots in Kano were able to enforce their power in order to keep the Anglican House Church from expanding its size and power base. They saw it as a threat to the nearby Mosque, even though the Anglican House Church had been there forty years prior to the building of the Mosque.Ibrahim, pp. 65-66 Additionally, there were two student groups in Nigeria who came into contestation, the Fellowship of Christian Students and the Muslim Student Society. In one instance there was an evangelical campaign organised by the FCS and brought into question why one sect should dominate the campus of the Kafanchan college of education. This quarrel accelerated to the point where the Muslim students organised protests around the city and culminated in the burning of a Mosque at the college. The Christian majority at the college retaliated on March 9. Twelve people died, several Mosques were burnt and a climate of fear was created. The retaliation was pre-planned.Ibrahim, pp. 66‚Äì68 Exploitation of the media used to propagate the ideas of the conflict, thereby radicalising each force even more. Media was biased on each side so while places like the Federal Radio Corporation discussed the idea of defending Islam during this brief moment of terror, it did not report the deaths and damage caused by Muslims, galvanising the Muslim population. Similarly, the Christian papers did not report the damage and deaths caused by Christians but rather focused on the Islamic terror.Ibrahim, pp. 67‚Äì70 Other individuals leading these religious movements use the media to spread messages which gradually became more intolerant of other religions, and because of these religious divisions radical Islam continues to be a problem in Nigeria today.Ibrahim, p. 72 Maitatsine In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a major Islamic uprising led by Maitatsine and his followers, Yan Tatsine that led to several thousand deaths. After Maitatsine's death in 1980, the movement continued some five years more. =1990s= In 1991, the German evangelist Reinhard Bonnke attempted a crusade in Kano, causing a religious riot leading to the deaths of about a dozen people.Violence in Nigeria: The Crisis of Religious Politics and Secular Ideologies, by Toyin Falola, pg 212. , Nigeria: Information about a riot on 14 October 1991 at a meeting with the German evangelist Reinhard Bounike in Kano.

The film stars Dev Patel as Srinivasa Ramanujan, a real-life mathematician who, after growing up poor in Madras, India, earns admittance to Cambridge University during World War I, where he becomes a pioneer in mathematical theories with the guidance of his professor, G. H. Hardy, portrayed by Jeremy Irons. Filming began in August 2014 at Trinity College, Cambridge. The film had its world premiere as a gala presentation at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, and was selected as the opening gala of the 2015 Zurich Film Festival. It also played other film festivals including Singapore International Film Festival and Dubai International Film Festival.  Plot  At the turn of the twentieth century, Srinivasa Ramanujan is a struggling and indigent citizen in the city of Madras in India working at menial jobs at the edge of poverty. While performing his menial labor, his employers notice that he seems to have exceptional skills at mathematics and they begin to make use of him for rudimentary accounting tasks. It becomes equally clear to his employers, who are college educated, that Ramanujan's mathematical insights exceed the simple accounting tasks they are assigning to him and soon they encourage him to make his personal writings in mathematics available to the general public and to start to contact professors of mathematics at universities by writing to them. One such letter is sent to G.H. Hardy, a famous mathematician at University of Cambridge, who begins to take a special interest in Ramanujan. Ramanujan at this time also marries while performing his menial labor and sending out his first publications. Hardy soon invites Ramanujan to Cambridge to test his mettle as a potential theoretical mathematician. Ramanujan is overwhelmed by the opportunity and decides to pursue Hardy's offer, even though this means he must leave his wife for an extended period. He parts lovingly with his wife and promises to keep up his correspondence with her. Upon arrival at Cambridge, Ramanujan encounters various forms of racial prejudice and finds his adjustment to life in England more difficult than expected, though Hardy is much impressed by Ramanujan's abilities. Hardy remains concerned about Ramanujan's ability to communicate effectively due to his lack of experience in writing proofs, but with perseverance he manages to get Ramanujan published in a major journal. In the meantime, Ramanujan finds out that he is suffering from tuberculosis and his frequent letters home to his wife remain unanswered after many months. Hardy continues to see much more promise in Ramanujan. However, he remains unaware of the personal difficulties his student is having with his housing and with his lack of contact with his family back home in India. Ramanujan's health worsens while he continues delving into deeper and more profound research interests in mathematics under the guidance of Hardy and others at Cambridge. His wife, after much elapsed time, wonders why she has not heard from Ramanujan and eventually discovers that his mother has been intercepting his letters. While still in England, Hardy takes special efforts to get Ramanujan's now recognisably exceptional mathematical skills to be fully accepted by his university by nominating Ramanujan for a fellowship at Trinity College. At first, Hardy fails for reasons related to college politics and recurrent racial prejudice at the time. By gaining the support of key members of the college, Hardy again nominates Ramanujan for a fellowship; he is accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Society and then as a Fellow of Trinity College. Ramanujan is eventually reunited with his family in India, though his declining health, which suffered from poor housing and harsh winter weather in England, ultimately takes its toll and leads to his premature demise all too soon after his recognition as a mathematician of international merit and importance.  Cast  * Dev Patel as Srinivasa Ramanujan * Jeremy Irons as G. H. Hardy * Devika Bhise as Janaki * Toby Jones as John Edensor Littlewood * Stephen Fry as Sir Francis Spring * Jeremy Northam as Bertrand Russell * Kevin McNally as Major MacMahon * Enzo Cilenti as Doctor * Arundhati Nag as Ramanujan's mother * Dhritiman Chatterjee as Narayana Iyer * Shazad Latif as Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis * Roger Narayan as an iyengar While Irons is more than 40 years Patel's senior, the real Hardy was only 10 years older than Ramanujan. Production Tamil actor R. Madhavan was initially selected to portray the lead role in the film after agreeing terms during January 2012, but the makers eventually decided they wanted an international actor to play Ramanujan.  Reception  Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 62% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 123 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. The critics' consensus reads: \\"The Man Who Knew Infinity might be a tad too conventional to truly do its subject justice, but Dev Patel (Srinivasa Ramanujan) and Jeremy Irons (G.H. Hardy) elevate the end result beyond mere biopic formula.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 56 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". After the film's world premiere, Allan Hunter in Screen Daily found the film to be \\"a well-heeled, sincere production following the memories of Ramanujan's English mentor and friend... The film tells such a good story that it is hard to resist. The old-fashioned virtues of a well-told tale and a particularly fine performance from Jeremy Irons should endear the film to that supposedly under-served older demographic who like to turn out for a weekday matinee... Mathematics plays a key role in the story, but in a way that is entirely accessible, allowing the viewer to comprehend the advances that Ramanujan made and why his legacy remains so important almost a century after his death.\\" Deborah Young in The Hollywood Reporter found the film to be a \\"respectable but all too conventional biopic\\". Mathematicians Ken Ono and Manjul Bhargava collaborated on the film, which has been praised by mathematicians and scientists for its accurate mathematics and authentic portrayal of mathematicians. George E. Andrews, former President of the American Mathematical Society, praised the film for its moving portrayal of the deep relationship between Ramanujan and Hardy. The London Mathematical Society proclaimed that the film \\"outshines Good Will Hunting in almost every way\\". Reviewing the film for Nature, Andrew Robinson wrote that \\"the film took more than ten years to create. It is worth the wait.\\"  Release  Mister Smith Entertainment handled international sales of the film. Warner Bros. released the film in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2016. IFC Films released it in the U.S. on 29 April 2016.

His views were shaped by his time in the porn industry, in which he worked for nine years, and led him to view its effect as detrimental to persons involved. In 2015, Pauling admitted to engaging in sex with three teenage girls from 2012 to 2014, \\"motivated by an unnatural or abnormal interest in children,\\" according to his plea. He pleaded no contest and agreed to a 6-year prison sentence. Early life Pauling was born the son of a Pentecostal pastor. He has stated that his strong Christian upbringing is what began to turn him away from Christianity. When he was a senior in high school he moved into his aunt's home in another city to take an advanced math class. It was here he met his future wife, Wendy, who was a devout Christian. He would eventually reconvert to Christianity. They dated for many years before finally marrying. Pauling has stated that it was during this time, when he lived with his young wife, that they purchased a computer and he began his fascination with pornography. Eventually he decided he somehow wanted a career making pornography and founded Pauling Technology Consulting. Career in pornography Pauling Technology Consulting was founded in 1997 to create pornographic content to be licensed by other larger companies. He funded this side business all through his own money he had saved up. For the first three years of his career, it was a side business of his that earned him extra income. When he eventually told his wife about his activities, the marriage fell apart and he moved into his office. When he began doing his porn career full-time, the first month he brought in over $50,000. He began at first taking photos of young women, ultimately filming scenes of both \\"hardcore\\" and \\"softcore\\" pornography. He created content with pornographic models and actresses that he then published under contract for larger porn sites. One of his largest and most lucrative contracts was with Playboy, with whom he worked for many years. For several years he was averaging an income of around half a million dollars. Pauling stated that he was deeply immersed in the lifestyle, wealth, and affluence that came with his career. He claims it further pushed him away from his family and Christianity. He again fell out of Christianity at this time, developing a hatred for it. Part of this hatred, he has stated, stemmed from Christian groups protesting against his work or outside porn conventions telling him he was \\"going to hell\\". Pauling routinely advertised his content on Christian web pages and forums, since he saw them as 'hypocrites' and 'sexually repressed'. He has claimed that it was on these databases and forums that he received some of his greatest number of clients. Despite his continuing and successful career he began to despise the man he had become. He has stated that late in his career, many of the women he had recruited into the industry had contacted him in the hopes of having their Internet content taken down, although he lacked the authority to do so. He has also stated that several of these women had careers and relationships ruined due to their involvement in pornography. =XXX Church= In 2006, while entering the Las Vegas Porn Convention, and after being accosted by Christian protesters, he took notice of a sign for XXXChurch, a church group preaching acceptance of any and all persons, including porn-industry workers. He had previously been introduced to XXCChurch in 2002, but it had not taken serious steps into joining until then. XXXChurch, headed by Craig Gross became very popular at porn conventions, brothels, strip clubs, etc. Pauling became interested in this group, as it preached tolerance for all. ‚ÄúThe Christians I grew up around would never talk to a porn producer, much less broadcast it to their listeners...But they were doing things in such a different way. They were actually loving people. It was such a non-confrontational approach. I couldn't help but say, if I was going to be a Christian, this is the kind of Christian I‚Äôd want to be.‚Äù At first he was antagonistic towards the group, calling them 'hypocrites' and posting online comments such as \\"God does not exist\\". However, over time he became more open and accepting of the group. He eventually would become more active in it, eventually joining and deciding to reconvert once more. He had begun to detest the lifestyle and affects pornography had on his life. =Leaving the industry= Due to his reconversion into Christianity, he began second-guessing his career in pornography. He was offered a new, very lucrative contract by Playboy. At first he intended to accept the offer, believing that his Christian faith and a porn career were compatible. However, after what he claims to be an intervention by God, he decided that he could no longer stay in the industry. Soon after he partially reconciled with his wife, although they remain divorced. Quitting the industry, he suddenly had much less income. However the family received large donations from various Christian charities and Pauling has stated that all his hatred of Christianity melted then. He has lamented at the number of women he had previously recruited or worked with who have since contacted him depicting their regret and shame at having done porn. Anti- porn activism Pauling soon after began taking seminary classes to become a Pastor. He viewed his previous life in porn production and use as an addiction and began speaking about it. With the help of Craig Gross and XXXChurch, he started an outreach that spoke about the dangers of pornography from multiple points of view. Pauling said that pornography was addictive and that the industry was harmful to women. As a Christian, he believed it to be sinful. Pauling has expressed the view that pornography use can lead to other more serious vices including sex trafficking. =Guilty Pleasure= Pauling spoke at the Guilty Pleasure conference in Melbourne, Australia. Guilty Pleasure is a non-profit Christian organization with the goal of showing the negative effects of pornography use. At this conference Pauling explained his mission to educate the world on the negative effects of porn usage. In this conference he also illustrated how widespread porn usage was, even among Christian groups. He has done several interviews for Guilty Pleasure in which he expresses his beliefs that porn is incredibly damaging to the actors who partake, along with families, and individuals themselves. He states that porn usage is overall degrading for all parties involved and seeks to educate users on the damage they do to themselves. =Debate= Pauling and Gross together debated at Yale University against two famous porn actors including Ron Jeremy. In the debate, Pauling and Gross said that today far more porn is viewed than historically and that it has become more accessible to young children. Pauling stated that porn is incredibly degrading to the women, and sometimes men, involved. The other side did not deny that exploitation and abuse happens, but claimed that women accepted the risk of doing porn. The debate was inconclusive, but each side kept strongly to their beliefs. Sex charges Pauling was arrested December 1, 2014 on three felony sex charges, including unlawful intercourse (statutory rape), after a 16-year-old female told law enforcement that Pauling had ongoing sexual contact with her for the past three years. The teen informed detectives that Pauling had told her that if she were to ever tell officers about the relationship, she should tell him first so he could kill himself. She also said Pauling told her he wasn't like other child molesters because he loved her.http://www.appeal- democrat.com/news/trial-ordered-for-ex-porn-producer- pauling/article_f5c87c5a-a84a-11e4-b107-6b317993a277.html On October 15, 2015, Pauling admitted to engaging in oral and vaginal sex with that victim from when she was age 14 in 2012, continuing into 2014. He also admitted to lewd or lascivious behavior with a 16-year-old female, ‚Äúmotivated by an unnatural or abnormal interest in children,‚Äù according to the plea. Pauling also admitted massaging a third teen victim's genitals in early 2014. He pleaded no contest and agreed to a 6-year prison sentence.

Children's Literature Comprehensive Database, \\"Stuart Little\\". Accessed December 16, 2014. The first film has Stuart adopted from an orphanage after the accidental death of his birth parents. =Eleanor Little= Eleanor Little (portrayed by Geena Davis in the films and voiced by Jennifer Hale in the animated series) is mother to Stuart and his siblings, and wife of Frederick Little. She is a loving mother and can sometimes be overprotective of Stuart. Eleanor gave birth to Martha sometime after the events of the first film, and the DVD commentary for Stuart Little 2 reveals that she is a music teacher at Stuart and George's school. She demonstrates DIY skills in Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild when she makes improvements to the family's lakeside cabin. =Frederick Little= Frederick C. Little (portrayed and voiced by Hugh Laurie) is the hard-working and friendly father of Stuart, George, and Martha, and husband of Eleanor. He works at the New York Museum of Natural History and plays piano. Frederick is supportive of his family, encouraging Stuart to see the bright side of bad situations and telling him the importance of perseverance. He tries to get his wife to let Stuart do physical activities despite her fears for his safety. In Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild, when Eleanor refuses to let Stuart enrol in the Scouts due to his small stature, Frederick chips in saying it might do him some good, he was a Scout himself, and that he will watch out for him. Frederick volunteers himself to be in the Scouts too as a helper. He also helps his wife remodel their cabin. =George Little= George Little (portrayed by Jonathan Lipnicki in Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2, voiced by Myles Jeffrey in the animated series and by Corey Padnos in Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild) is the eldest child of Eleanor and Frederick Little. George enjoys making friends and hanging out with his brother Stuart. His interests include toy models, racing model boats, and video games. George was excited at first about having a little brother until he realized that his parents had adopted a mouse. He ignored Stuart until they played together with some of George's models, after which George became appreciative and defensive of Stuart. He fights a rival for insulting Stuart, and instigates a search party when the police fail to bring Stuart home. In Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild, George is seen playing a handheld video game and develops a crush on Brooke, a Lake Scout at Lake Garland. George joins the Scouts to be close to Brooke. =Snowbell= Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane in the 1999 film and Stuart Little 2, Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in Stuart Little: The Animated Series and by Kevin Schon in Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild) is the Littles‚Äô wise-cracking pet Persian cat and a former member of Smokey's alley cat gang. Snowbell is lovable, selfish, cowardly, and shallow. He has been in the family longer than Stuart, George and Martha. George, Eleanor, and Frederick are oblivious to the fact that he can talk. In the first film, Snowbell is jealous of Stuart and plots to get rid of him. He considers eating him but cannot as Stuart is a member of the family. He tries to keep Stuart's existence secret from the alley cats because they will try to eat him and because their \\"mouse-with-a-pet-cat\\" relationship is an embarrassment. When the alleycats discover and hunt Stuart Snowbell has a change of heart and defends him. Stuart returns the favor and they become friendly. In Stuart Little 2, Snowbell reluctantly helps Stuart look for Margalo, whom he has taken a dislike to, when she mysteriously disappears. Later, having found Margalo, he is upset at her departure. Snowbell has further adventures camping in Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild. =Martha Little= Martha Little (portrayed by Anna and Ashley Hoelck in Stuart Little 2 and voiced by Jennifer Hale in Stuart Little: The Animated Series) is the baby daughter of the family. Her character was created specifically for the film series and does not appear in the original novel. She is very messy and curious about the world. In Stuart Little 2, Martha says her first words. In Stuart Little: The Animated Series, Martha speaks more, but still sometimes gibbers. In Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild her only speaking is babbles and a single line. 1945 novel =Margalo= Margalo (voiced by Melanie Griffith in Stuart Little 2 and by Kathy Najimy in Stuart Little: The Animated Series) is a canary, one of Stuart's closest friends, and his love interest. She is kind and free-spirited and always there for the people she loves. Her mother died when she was just a baby and she was pulled from the gutter by Falcon. In the 1945 novel, Eleanor adopted Margalo. Stuart becomes more infatuated with her the longer she stays. She saves Stuart's life when he stumbles onto a garbage barge, and is warned of Snowbell's plot to eat her and flies away from the Littles'. In Stuart Little 2 Margalo was taken in by The Falcon, who raised her to steal Eleanor's two karat ring. Margalo befriends Stuart, leaves Falcon, and gives Eleanor's ring back. In Stuart Little: The Animated Series Margalo is a recurring character who sometimes visits the Littles. =Dr. Paul Carey= Dr. Paul Carey is a New York dentist who appeared only in the Stuart Little novel. He is a kind dentist who loves his patients, and a friend of Stuart‚Äôs.

She is said to be one of the best-dressed girls in New York City, with clothes that are especially tailored just for her. Harriet is also said to come from a rich family.

Stuart managed to beat his boat in the race by losing it in a thunderstorm. LeRoy does not appear in any of the film adaptations of the novel; his character was most likely replaced by Anton in the 1999 film due to the fact that both characters own a model sailboat called Lillian B. Womrath. =Miss Gunderson= Miss Gunderson was a character in the original Stuart Little novel who was mentioned, but never seen. She was the teacher at the local schoolhouse who was unable to teach her students due to being ill.

However, this character is unnamed, and she has Stuart and George in her class, unlike her book counterpart. =The Angora Cat= The Angora Cat was an unnamed female cat who lived in a tool shed in a small park near the Littles‚Äô house after escaping from a cage in a pet shop. Snowbell formulated a plan with the Angora Cat that would allow Snowbell to eat Margalo. =Edward Clydesdale= Edward Clydesdale is one of Dr. Paul Carey's patients who suggested where Stuart should look for Margalo. Most of his dialogue is barely understandable due to his teeth still being worked on as he was talking to Stuart. =Dr. Beechwood= Dr. Beechwood is a doctor in the novel who came to the Littles‚Äô house to take Stuart's temperature after Eleanor accidentally left him in the washing machine. Dr. Beechwood had a small role in the 1999 film just like he did in the novel.

He is an original character introduced for the 1999 film. Monty is shown to be unintelligent and is somewhat of a blabbermouth (which earns him the nickname \\"Monty the Mouth\\"). His goal throughout the series is to eat Stuart and cure his hunger pangs. His catchphrase is \\"Please?\\". =Uncle Crenshaw Little= Uncle Crenshaw Little (portrayed and voiced by Jeffrey Jones) is the brother of Frederick and Stretch Little and the uncle of Stuart, George, and Martha Little. Crenshaw first appeared in the first Stuart Little film as he attended the Little family reunion for Stuart's arrival into the family.

He was also mentioned in Stuart Little 2. =Smokey= Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri) is a dark gray alley cat who is the main antagonist of the first film and the leader of the alley cats. He came up with the plan to kill Stuart after Monty and Snowbell summoned him.

He is believed to be the idiot of his gang considering he tends to forget Stuart‚Äôs name. =Reginald Stout= Reginald Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby) is Stuart's fake father and the husband of Camille Stout. He and his wife live on a golf course. They were both forced by Smokey and his henchcats to pose as Stuart's supposedly long-lost parents as part of his plan. In the 2005 video game Stuart Little 3: Big Photo Adventure, it is shown that Reginald is an expert golfer and that has many trophies. =Camille Stout= Camille Stout (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) is Stuart‚Äôs fake mother and the wife of Reginald Stout. Although she and her husband were forced to pose as Stuart‚Äôs long-lost parents, she tends to care for Stuart as if he was her own son and eventually reveals to him, along with Reginald, about Smokey's plans and urge him to flee. Camille reappeared in the 2001 video game Stuart Little: The Journey Home for the Game Boy Color along with her husband Reginald in a driving stage. =Anton= Anton (portrayed by Miles Marsico) is a mean- spirited child who bullied George in the first film. Anton tried to cheat his way to victory in the boat race by knocking out the other contestants. He appears to be very passionate about boat racing despite his young age, and he is depicted as being rude, inconsiderate, and overly competitive. =Detective Sherman= Detective Sherman (portrayed by Jon Polito) is a detective who works for the New York Police Department, organizing the investigation into Stuart's kidnapping. =Detective Phil Allen= Detective Phil Allen (portrayed by Jim Doughan) is Detective Sherman's partner. =Mrs. Keeper= Mrs. Keeper (portrayed by Julia Sweeney) is the head of the New York City Public Orphanage where Stuart was raised.

Stuart Little 2 =The Falcon= The Falcon (voiced by James Woods in Stuart Little 2 and by Pat Fraley in Stuart Little: The Animated Series) is a peregrine falcon who is Margalo's former boss and the main antagonist of Stuart Little 2. He is a power-hungry falcon who has a threatening, abusive personality towards Margalo. He took Margalo in when she was young and raised her to be his personal slave, forcing her to steal various objects, including Stuart‚Äôs mother‚Äôs wedding ring. The Falcon returned in the animated series in the episode \\"A Little Bit Country\\", determined to get revenge on Stuart. During Stuart Little 2's production when the main antagonist was decided to be a bird, the animators researched a number of different predatorial birds including Eagles and Hawks. The peregrine falcon was ultimately decided due to its villainous postures. Early designs of The Falcon originally had him walking on both feet in an anthropomorphic fashion while carrying a Necklace beaded with the valuables he had initially stolen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upUOMOk3E7Y =Will Powell= Will Powell (portrayed and voiced by Marc John Jefferies) is George's loyal best friend who was introduced in Stuart Little 2 and later reappeared in the Stuart Little: The Animated Series episode, \\"He Said He Said\\". =The Coach= The coach (portrayed by Jim Doughan) is George and Stuart's soccer coach. =Wallace= Wallace (portrayed by Angelo Massagli) is George's second bully who picked on him on the soccer field.

MacDonald, and volume 9 (online only), by Anne Newlands and Judith Parker. National Gallery of Canada, Artists in Canada database. Retrieved July 17, 2014. Born in London, England, W.J. Hopkinson studied art there briefly but was mostly self-taught. Hopkinson came to Canada in 1912. He exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy, the Ontario Society of Artists and the Nova Scotia Society of Artists. Although his talent was well respected and he went on painting trips with many leading painters, Hopkinson never achieved the same level of recognition as some of his contemporaries. Hopkinson didn't become a full-time artist until late in life, in the late 1950s when he was in his late 60s. Hopkinson worked mainly in oils, with landscapes of forests, winter scenes and docked boats, but many pencil sketches have also survived. He painted from the 1930s until 1970, most often in the Aurora to Haliburton area of Ontario, Canada. He also painted scenes from trips to the Canadian East Coast, Alberta and British Columbia, and to Massachusetts. He also made one trip back to his home country of England, but he only painted a handful of scenes in London. Hopkinson was known to travel into the dense bush and forests in the Haliburton area and paint en plein air oil paintings on panels using palette knives, laying on thick layers of oil paint. This technique was suited to portraying the ruggedness of the landscape around him, showing fallen trees, forests and lakes under skies coloured in dramatic shades of blues, pinks and orange. The artist taught at the St. Croix School of Art, New Brunswick, and at several centres in Ontario. Hopkinson was honoured by the Ontario Society of Artists by having his painting \\"Town House\\" hung at the 70th annual spring exhibition being held at The Art Gallery of Toronto in 1942.The Express-Herald (newspaper), Newmarket, ON, March 12, 1942. The actor Vincent Price was an admirer of Hopkinson's artworks, including his paintings in The Vincent Price Collection sold by Simpson's department store in Toronto and Chicago in 1965. Price even penned birthday wishes to Hopkinson on his 80th birthday in which Price called himself as a \\"longtime admirer of your beautiful paintings.Letter in Hopkinson family collection. Hopkinson held his first one-man show of paintings at the Main Branch of The North York Public Library in the autumn of 1966 and subsequently at other library branches of North York that year. The artist was most active in art circles in the Newmarket and Aurora area, northwest of Toronto. Hopkinson was a founder of the Newmarket Art Club, and member of the Willowdale Group of Artists and the Society of Co-operative Artists, Toronto. After his death on February 21, 1970, a retrospective exhibit and sale was held. His friend and pupil, artist Isabelle Van Zant, did a portrait for the exhibition cover.  References  W.J.

The company was founded in 1926, and operated until 1972. The plant was then shut down, except for a small portion used as an outlet store, until its final complete shutdown in 1999. The plant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Founding and growth Founded in 1926 by Bernard Mock, Nathaniel Judson and John K. Voehringer, the Mock, Judson, Voehringer Company of NC, Inc was formed for hosiery production. Following industrialists such as the Cone Family, the MJV Company built a production facility at 2610 Oakland Avenue, formerly 1004 Howard street, in 1927. Starting with 14 original employees, by 1929 they had increased to 600 workers and were producing four million pairs of silk hosiery annually. The complex had also grown from its original 10,000 square feet to roughly 140,000. Worker housing and benefits Unlike other textile corporations, such as the Cone mills, who would not begin to pull away from providing worker housing until the Great Depression, MJV did not have mill villages. Directories from the time period have indicated that employees were taking advantage of a local booming housing economy and lived in the surrounding areas of Lindley and Highland Park.archive.org MJV also provided an on-site nurse, a cafeteria for their employees, and a recreational baseball team, the Mojuds Nighthawks.Mojud Singer (1937) Labor disputes In 1937, two years after the passing of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the American Federation of Hosiery Workers filed charges against MJV claiming that the mill had engaged in unfair labor practices including the distribution of anti-union literature, firing employees on the basis of union membership, and removal of organizers attempting to distribute union literature outside of the facility.National Labor Rights Board National Register of Historic Places The facility is listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Guilford County, North Carolina.

She made her first screen appearance in the show's pilot episode \\"Re-Entry\\", which first aired on July 9, 2014 on the CBS network in the United States. Molly is an astronaut. She is married to John Woods and is the mother of Ethan Woods, a \\"humanich\\" android. While aboard a spaceflight to ISEA (the fictional space agency that replaced NASA) space station, she inexplicably becomes pregnant during the 13-month solo voyage. She returns to Earth amid chaotic happenings with her family life while in the space program and unexplained events of the early pregnancy. She goes through medical and psychological tests after returning to ISEA. Present time The believed dead Harmon Kryger makes an attempt to contact Molly after she has an eventful day with her husband John and son Ethan. From hurried and missed breakfast with John, to the trip to the museum with Ethan which features Ethan with more questions than answers from Molly. Also, the revelation from Sam Barton that her brain scans are just like Krygers, (but he died) and she is 14 weeks pregnant. Alt URL The night is just as mysterious as the Woods prepare for the next day's events. Later we see Ethan prepared for interaction with children at school, as Molly defends his place in a school setting to the worried parents. Molly reveals to John, she just signed up for another rotation on the Seraphim, while John was ready to add Ethan to the family. Molly objects saying, \\"you just can't plug and play a family.\\" Molly's boss interrupts her morning jog to let her in on the Covert program that allowed her to become pregnant by timed release Nano-technology. He mentions her brain scans that matched Kryger's and that's what led to his suicide. Unbeknownst to Molly Director Sparks is planning to covertly bring her in for further study with a medical team. Her doctor Dr. Barton, arrives that night to draw a blood sample to determine the DNA of Molly's unborn fetus. Later, Molly reveals to John she is pregnant and that she is afraid he wouldn't believe her. Flashbacks to the past In the opening, we see Molly in a darkened room reminiscing about earlier times with Marcus. She goes to the bookcase and removes an old photo album, and we see a picture of her with Marcus in his ISEA mission uniform with Molly and it's a moving scene. They begin to look at each other and tighten their embrace. She is interrupted when John appears after putting Ethan in rest mode for the night. Next we see her aboard the Seraphim initiating bio-sample tests on plants and worms, when Ben, her onboard computer (a disembodied voice) tells her of an incoming v-com, or video communication from John and Ethan. The v-com is interrupted by what Ben says is a solar flare. Ben then goes offline while Molly frantically tries to reboot. That's when we first see Marcus appear to Molly's shock and surprise. She and Marcus interact briefly after she tries to burn her hand to attempt to see if the person she sees is real. Next we see Molly explaining away 13 lost hours of video from the space station. Gordon Kern, (the deputy director of ISEA) mentions the backup cameras on board the Seraphim, and questions Molly about the lost footage which she explains away (not convincingly to Director Sparks) as a glitch. We see Molly wake up in the lab and in a frantic scene we see her playback the security video footage to see if Marcus is there, and he's not, but she realizes she has to hide the footage from ISEA since Marcus died years earlier. The next night John has the birthday party for Molly and they invite friends and close ISEA associates. Dr. Barton arrives to take the blood sample from Molly, after she leaves Molly has sharp pains in her stomach and then flashes back to the event on the Seraphim with Marcus saying \\"it's ok.\\" Then Molly returns to the party and the doorbell rings and it's Tim Dawkins, Marcus' brother. Molly hasn't seen Tim for a while. He tells her he's on furlough and decided to drop by. We learn she actually hasn't seen Tim in eight years since she lost the baby and Marcus. He curiously asks Molly if she has seen Marcus and tries to reassure Molly that it will be all right. Next we see Molly call Tim over when John wants a group party picture. She mingles in the party for a while. Then after revealing her secret to John they return and Molly asks John if he has seen Tim. Molly suddenly realizes she is the only one who has seen Tim and something is happening to her.

A masked man is in her room and attacks her but Amanda manages to fight him off and she throws him out of the window. She calls Nolan (Grant Bowler) and tells him about the attack and Nolan promises her that he will find who was the man. The next day, Amanda feels like someone is following her at the marketplace and when she turns around she sees Nolan. The two of them have a conversation where Nolan is really cruel at her telling her that he never cared about her or her sister and that both of them are incapable of love. He attacks her but Amanda escapes only to run into the real Nolan who patrols the city with Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) and Tommy (Dewshane Williams) and realizes that something is wrong. Amanda rushes to Niles (James Murray) thinking that her hallucinations must be related to the adreno he is providing her but Niles reassures her that adreno is clean and sends her to stay at the McCawley house where she can be safe. Irisa and Tommy stay with her to protect her while Nolan tells her that he investigated her house after the attack and he did not find any evidence indicating that someone else was in the house except from her. He also found the adreno pipe but Amanda tells him that adreno does not cause hallucinations. Later at night, Amanda hears some noises and Irisa and Tommy get out to check leaving Amanda alone with a gun. When Tommy gets back, Amanda hits him in the head and then shoots Irisa thinking that they are attackers. When she realizes that they are Tommy and Irisa, she runs away. Nolan tries to talk to Niles about the adreno and him providing Amanda with it just to have her even if it is causing her all those troubles. While they are talking, Niles sees Connor Lang (Gale Harold), Amanda's ex fianc√©, and follows him.

Meanwhile, Doc Yewll also has hallucinations of an old friend/lover named Lev (Hannah Cheesman). Lev appears to Yewll and tells her that she came back to ask for forgiveness because she is dying. During their conversations it is revealed that the two of them were working together during the Pale Wars and did some terrible things that led Lev to kill herself. Lev tries to convince Yewll to do the same but the last moment Yewll changes her mind and goes back to her office where she finds Nolan trying to remove the implant from Amanda. She stops him, and she removes it herself. saving Amanda's life. In the rest of the episode, Datak (Tony Curran) goes to the Tarr house and performs a ritual in front of the whole family that will allow him to visit them. Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz) does not like the idea of Datak being around her child after what he did to Alak (Jesse Rath) and the whole family. She tells him so and then leaves the room. Later, she goes to the radio station to find Alak but he is not there and instead she sits with Deirdre (Kristina Pesic) and tells her that Alak's family will never accept her as their own despite all her efforts to learn their language and follow their customs. Deirdre tells her that she has to \\"live in their skin\\". Datak asks Rafe (Graham Greene), who he finds living in the Tarr house since he was evicted from his own home, to talk to his family, especially Christie, and convince them to accept him back. Rafe does not seem willing to do it and Datak also tells him about his plan to take Defiance, and the mines, back from the E-Rep. He says that he works with the Votanis Collective and they will provide him with weapons for his cause. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the people who are behind the ego implant in Amanda's neck are Niles and Doc Yewll, who also have an implant of their own and that is why they were hallucinating as well. They did it to collect Amanda's memories and they managed to collect the last three weeks but it is unknown why they need them. Yewll removes the implant from Niles but she keeps hers, despite telling Niles that she had already removed and destroyed it.

Michael Ahr of Den of Geek rated the episode with 5/5 stating that the episode provided plenty of food for thought. \\"If you had told me last season that I would be looking forward this much to the next episode of Defiance each week, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed you. As the show nears the halfway point of its summer run, it‚Äôs exciting to see where things are headed.\\" Joe Winder from Geeked Out Nation rated the episode with 8/10 saying that overall was a good episode with a great story that built some of the characters of the show but it completely forgot other main characters, like Irisa's story. \\"Some of what we learned could be used for future stories. My main issue is the big story was forgotten by everyone and leave me wondering if it‚Äôs big deal why did Irisa just forget about it for a few days. I know if it was me I would be freaking out wondering what‚Äôs going on.\\" Billy Grifter of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode stating that even none of the episodes so far were outstanding, they put a good base for the show's future. \\"While those behind Defiance haven‚Äôt hit a narrative home run yet this season, there have been many new subtle layers laid down inviting the possibility of delivering one. This was a strong story, and so far none of the episodes has been a complete fiasco.\\" Andrew Santos of With an Accent gave a good review to the episode saying that it was highly enjoyable. \\"The main story arc was weird and helped develop a few of the characters. [...] I liked the episode‚Äôs twist involving the ego. It would have been too clich√© if we found out Amanda and Pottinger were just really high.\\" Mark Trammell from TV Equals also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was a decent one \\"even if it raised more questions than it answered\\". Despite the positive reviews, Katelyn Barnes of Geeks Unleashed rated the episode with 6/10 saying that the whole ego storyline was a disappointment.

The pagan Celts of Britain had already been extensively Christianized during the Roman period: although only four victims of Diocletian's persecution are now known (Saints Alban, \\"Amphibalus\\", and Julius and Aaron), Britons met the pagan Saxon invaders largely as Christians prior to being driven back to Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. The family of Vortigern, which continued to hold Powys in the early medieval period, produced numerous saints. Although they largely refrained from missionizing among the Germans, Welsh refugees and missionaries were responsible for the Christianization of IrelandBaring-Gould (1898), p. 41. and Brittany.Baring- Gould (1898), p. 26. The title of \\"saint\\" was used quite broadly in the Celtic churches. Extreme cases are Irish accounts of Gerald of Mayo's presiding over 3300 \\"saints\\" and Welsh claims that Bardsey held the remains of . More often, the title was given to the founder of any ecclesiastical settlement, which would thenceforth be known as their llan. Such communities were organized on tribal models: founding saints were almost invariably lesser members of local dynasties and their successors chosen from among their kin. The golden age of such establishments was the 6th century, when the \\"Three Saintly Families of Wales\\"--those of the invading Irish Brychan and Northerners Cunedda and Caw-- displaced many of the local Silurian rulers in favor of their families and clans.Baring-Gould, Sabine. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. XVI, \\"The Celtic Church and its Saints\\", pp. 30-40\\\\. Longmans, Green, & Co. (New York), 1898. By some estimates,Rowan Williams, Reviews and comments on 'The Book of Welsh Saints'. these traditions produced over 800 pre-congregational saints venerated locally in Wales, but invasions by Saxons, Irishmen, Vikings, Normans, and others destroyed many ecclesiastical records. Similarly, the distance from Rome, suspicion of Celtic Christianity, and the relative disconnect of the local sees from Rome has left only two Welsh saints in the General Roman Calendar: Saints David (Dewi) and Winifred (Gwenffrewi).

Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized \\"journey\\" through art history, focusing on Western works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the \\"all-pervasive mass media\\" and must fight to keep their capacity for contemplation. The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece. Artists detailed include Titian, Manet, Picasso, and Jackson Pollock among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Wall Street Journal, while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as The New York Times Book Review. Summary Paglia discusses the Charioteer of Delphi, a notable ancient Greek work. While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, Glittering Images focuses on modern cultural ignorance. Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized \\"journey\\" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past. In it, she argues, \\"the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized.\\" Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the ancient Egyptian funerary images of Queen Nefertari, a royal whose name means \\"the most beautiful of them all\\". Paglia refers to how the civilization \\"dreamed of conquering the terrors of death\\", and she notes how \\"Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there\\", describing the visual power of this \\"eternal present\\" depicted.Glittering Images, pp.3-5 She then turns to the Cycladic statuettes carved by Bronze Age residents of several Aegean Sea islands, which feature \\"coolly geometric\\" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, Stone Age people (such as the 'Venus of Willendorf') while still displaying vulvae markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of Cycladic art are cited as \\"daring explorations of form and structure\\" foreshadowing the future.Glittering Images, pp.11-13 The author then describes the 'Charioteer of Delphi', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the ancient Greek ideals of \\"young male beauty\\" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete \\"grave and dignified\\" with his meditative expression, giving a \\"look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition\\".Glittering Images, pp.15-18 She goes on to write about the 'Porch of the Maidens' in the Erechtheion in Athens, Greece, with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as \\"a remarkable display of female power\\" as \\"muscular strength\\" co-exists with womanly curves,Glittering Images, pp.21 and then the piece 'Laoco√∂n and His Sons', a violent scene carved in marble in which sea serpents attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of theodicy.Glittering Images, pp.27 Paglia praises the intricacy of the Book of Kells, the section devoted to Virgin Mary pictured here. The book goes on next to the famous mosaic of Saint John Chrysostom in the Hagia Sophia, a piece that Paglia writes as having an \\"implacable intensity of gaze\\" making it a great piece of Byzantine art,Glittering Images, pp.36-37 and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's Book of Kells, an \\"intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe.\\"Glittering Images, pp.39 The eighth piece included is Donatello's 'Mary Magdalene', a work of the Italian Renaissance created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be \\"harsh and imposing\\".Glittering Images, pp.43 Paglia then discusses Titian's 'Venus with a Mirror'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating \\"opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy\\" onto the viewer.Glittering Images, pp.49 Paglia next discusses Bronzino's 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the Mannerism movement it shows a \\"polished theatricality\\" arresting to the viewer,Glittering Images, pp.53 and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's 'Chair of Saint Peter' in the Vatican City, a 17th-century work showing how Baroque art often \\"overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur\\".Glittering Images, pp.59 She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of pop art, writing that, generally, the artistic movement \\"projects an innocent child‚Äôs view of the world.\\" She also argues that works by artists such as Andy Warhol, whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details 'Marilyn Diptych', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of Marilyn Monroe over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the \\"multiplicity of meanings\\" in the actress' life and legacy. The book additionally cites Eleanor Antin's conceptual art project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that \\"boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience.\\" Reception Writer John Adams of The New York Times Book Review published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being \\"so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised.\\" Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of Giotto, Michelangelo, El Greco, Rembrandt, Vermeer, and van Gogh, which he criticized. He supported how Paglia \\"encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively\\" at the world of art history, though concluded that her praise of George Lucas was assessing art \\"by its reach rather than its depth\\", and thus Paglia \\"has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold.\\" Journalist Gary Rosen of The Wall Street Journal, however, praised the book's \\"impressive range\\" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that \\"[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure\\", and he stated that the author \\"is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader.\\" In addition, The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a supportive article that labeled the book a \\"magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study\\". The Los Angeles Times published a supportive review by Michael S. Roth, an author and the president of Wesleyan University. He wrote, \\"Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here.\\" See also *Art history *Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith *What is a Masterpiece?

He has at times been identified as Joseph of Arimathea, perhaps because he is referred to as a \\"man of Israel\\"Justin E. Griffin, Glastonbury and the Grail: Did Joseph of Arimathea Bring the Sacred Relic to Britain? (McFarland, 2012) pages 96-97. and to have been born Jewish. Moreover, he is said to have returned from Rome with Caratacus, Saint Cyllin and Eigen and formed a religious college of twelve named Cor Eurgain (the choir of Eurgain), suggesting the early entry of Christianity into Britain. He may be commemorated in the village Llanilid. According to Thomas Morgan, Llanilid follows the tradition of Welsh place names attached to a parish in taking its title from the saint to whom the local church is dedicated. In Llanilid the local church is St. Ilid & St Curig's church, and Morgan states that this relates to Ilid a person who introduced Christianity to Wales in the 1st century. This research may be connected to that of famed literary forger Iolo Morganwg, who produced elaborate tales of Ilid going as far as stating that it was the Welsh names of Joseph of Arimathea.Francis, David J. (1971). \\"A brief account of three parishes\\". In Stewart Williams. Glamorgan Historian; VII. Cowbridge: D. Brown and Sons. p.208 Morgan relates that \\"Llan\\" ‚Äì \\"Ilid\\", refers to the 'parish of St Ilid'. This has been challenged by R. W. D. Fenn, who, after studying the Book of Llandaff and Nennius's Historia Brittonum writes in 1962 that the Latin equivalent of Ilid represents the name of a district, similar to Llandovery, and not a person. Fenn then writes that in 1566 Llanilid was dedicated to Ilid and Curig, whom he connects to the saints more commonly known in Christian tradition as Julietta and Quiricus. He links this through the Appendix of the Book of Llandaff which states that the church at Llanilid is first given as the 'Church of St Julitta'. His feast day is 30 June.

It can be used with or without the use of insulin therapy. Carbohydrate counting involves determining whether a food item has carbohydrate followed by the subsequent determination of how much carbohydrate the food item has in it.  What is carbohydrate?  Carbohydrate is one of three major macronutrients found in food. The other major macronutrients are protein and fat. Carbohydrate in its simplest form is known as glucose and can contribute to a rise in blood sugar. In people with diabetes, the body‚Äôs ability to keep blood sugar at a normal level is impaired. Dietary management of carbohydrate consumed is one tool used to help optimize blood sugar levels.  Carbohydrate content of foods  Carbohydrate is found in a number of foods including fruits, starchy vegetables (such as peas, potatoes, and corn), grains, milk and yogurt, legumes, and desserts. In general, foods such as meat, eggs, cheese, fats, and non-starchy vegetables (such as greens and broccoli) have little to no carbohydrate. Other foods free of carbohydrate include small quantities of certain condiments, unsweetened coffee and tea, and sugar free sodas. Carbohydrate content of foods is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel as ‚Äútotal carbohydrate‚Äù. Some food labels will list specific types of carbohydrate, such as ‚Äúfiber, sugar, or other carbohydrate‚Äù. With carbohydrate counting, the ‚Äútotal carbohydrate‚Äù is used as the carbohydrate amount. Carbohydrate counting can be done by either adding up grams of total carbohydrate or adding \\"carbohydrate units\\". A carbohydrate unit is simply 15 g of carbohydrate.  How it is used  Carbohydrate counting can be used with or without insulin therapy. = Without insulin = When carbohydrate counting is used without insulin, it can be used as a tool to manage blood sugar levels. A certain number of carbohydrate grams or carbohydrate units is consumed with each meal and with each snack. In keeping the carbohydrate at a certain level, the blood sugar is able to remain within a normal level. The American Diabetes Association recommends starting at around 45-60 carbohydrate grams (3-4 carb units) at each meal, with potential to increase or decrease that amount. = With insulin = Carbohydrate counting may be used with either a fixed insulin dosage or with a more flexible insulin dosage. Carb counting for fixed insulin dosage is done in the same manner as carbohydrate counting without insulin. The only difference is that insulin is administered with the meal. With more flexible insulin dosage, the insulin is administered in regards to the amount of carbohydrate consumed. The insulin amount will vary based on the amount of carbohydrates consumed.

In 1910, Daly left Sinn F√©in to join Connolly's Socialist Party of Ireland, a merger of the ISRP and parts of the Independent Labour Party.Kieran Allen, The politics of James Connolly, p.104 He subsequently joined Connolly in founding the Irish Labour Party. During the Dublin Lock-out of 1913, he was one of several leading figures in the Labour movement who were arrested, and the following year, he was a founding vice-chairman of the Irish Citizen Army.Sean O'Casey, The Story of the Irish Citizen Army After James Larkin suggested appointing Daly to lead the ITGWU in 1914, a long-standing disagreement with William X. O'Brien became public, O'Brien claiming that Daly was incompetent.Arthur Mitchell, Labour in Irish politics, 1890‚Äì1930, p.93 Daly had also split with Connolly, who wrote that \\"Daly is as little trusted by the Labour men as he is by the Nationalists\\",Donal Nevin, James Connolly, A Full Life and was able to instead become acting secretary himself. Connolly also ensured that Daly was not selected as a candidate for the 1915 Dublin Harbour by-election.Padraig Yeates, \\"Labour Waits\\", Dublin Review of Books In 1916, Daly was placed in Frongoch internment camp as the British Government considered him a threat during the Easter Rising; he was later moved to Reading Gaol. He worked with Delia Larkin in an attempt to resurrect the Irish Citizen Army, but this was unsuccessful, and led to further isolation in the ITGWU.William Delany, The Green and the Red, p.412Emmet O'Connor, Syndicalism in Ireland: 1917‚Äì1923, p.107 In 1919, Daly was elected as Secretary of the Dublin Trades Council, and he remained in the post until his death. Under his leadership, and due to his dispute with O'Brien, the council withdrew from the Labour Party.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.734 At the 1923 general election, Daly stood in Dublin North as one of four independent labour candidates sponsored by the trades council. Although he was not elected, Daly took 2,075 votes, beating the official Labour Party candidate.Arthur Mitchell, Labour in Irish politics, 1890‚Äì1930, p.189 Following disappointing results, the trades council reaffiliated with the Labour Party, and Daly focused his efforts on establishing the Workers' Union of Ireland. He served on the executive of the ITUC again from 1936 to 1939, and was elected as its president for 1939.

It begins at the Cranberry Lakes approximately east of Cranberry Portage and runs northeast to its mouth on the Nelson River. The river was a critical route for earlier European explorers and was part of the \\"Upper Tract\\" of the fur trade into Canadian interior. Route The headwaters of the Grass River are in Third Cranberry Lake, approximately east of Cranberry Portage. It then flows north to Elbow Lake, and turns sharply south to Iskwasum Lake after which it continues easterly to Reed Lake. This portion of the river is within Grass River Provincial Park. After Reed Lake, the river enters Tramping Lake, followed by the Wekusko Falls, Wekusko Lake and eastwards to Setting Lake. The river then passes Sasagiu Rapids Provincial Park, and Pisew Falls Provincial Wayside Park. It then enters Paint Lake and the Paint Lake Provincial Park. Continuing in a northeast direction, the Grass River passes through several remote lakes before its confluence with the Nelson River near Kelsey, Manitoba. The river runs for , and drains a watershed of . Description The remote river flows through the Churchill River Upland portion of the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests and is surrounded by mixed forest with stands of black spruce, white spruce, jack pine, and trembling aspen. The shoreline is characterized by steeply sloping irregular rock ridges and poorly drained areas of muskeg. Typical of the Canadian Shield, the river runs through rolling hilly terrain with abundant glacially scoured rock outcrops. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle and hawk owl. The Grass River area is largely pristine and home to moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, and beaver. There are also migrating herds of woodland caribou along the river's length. Many portions of the river are not easily accessible, but there is some trapping, hunting, and recreational fishing activity. The Grass River basin contains burbot, lake whitefish, northern pike, sucker, walleye and yellow perch. History The Grass River was originally inhabited by the Shield Archaic peoples who migrated from the present-day Northwest Territories 5,000 years ago. The many petrographs located along the river date to this period. Approximately 2,000 years ago, pottery was introduced to the region and the Woodland Cree emerged as the dominant culture in the area . In the 1700s, the river became an important route for Cree hunters travelling to York Factory at Hudson Bay to trade their furs. The first recorded Europeans to travel the Grass River were the Hudson's Bay Company fur traders and explorers Joseph Smith and Isaac Batt. In 1763, from York Factory they travelled up the Grass River to Cranberry Portage and then over to Lake Athapapuskow and down into the Saskatchewan River system. Smith died on the return journey. In 1774, explorer Samuel Hearne paddled up the Grass River to establish Cumberland House. In the summer of 1794, surveyor and explorer David Thompson travelled up the Grass River for the first of many times in his career mapping the interior of North America. Several fur trading posts were established along the river, most notably at Reed Lake House (1794) and Cranberry Lake (1804). In the early 20th century there was a mining boom, which saw further exploration by prospectors and ultimately several mining operations. The course of the river was first noted (crudely) in a 1760 map obtained by Moses Norton, the Factor at Churchill Fort from several Indian traders. The name \\"Grass River\\" was first documented on Samuel Hearne's map of 1776. In 1876 geologist Robert Bell surveyed the lower portions of the river, but it was not until 1896 when explorer Joseph Tyrell completed the first survey of its entire length. Tyrell recorded that the Cree name for the river was Muskuskow' Sipi, meaning \\"Grassy River\\". Canoe route The Grass River is a popular wilderness canoe route due to its pristine state, Indigenous rock paintings, scenic waterfalls, and sport fishing. A trip down the full length of the river can take up to three weeks, but most canoeists travel shorter sections such as the Cranberry Portage to Split Lake route. The difficulty rating is intermediate, with moderate portaging and advanced lake travel.

In 2008, she served as the House of Representatives Chair on Women's affairs., she represents the Langtang North and South constituency. She serves as Chairman of the House of Representatives' Committee on Human Rights. She has supported emergency funding for the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), increased penalties for child abuse and the creation of a National Child Protection and Enforcement Agency. In 2010, she participated in The GlobalPOWER¬Æ Women Network in Africa: Women Parliamentarians and Ministers United Against HIV/AIDS. She was one of only 11 women elected in 2007 who were re-elected in 2011 when the lower house was nearly 95% male.

After 2013 attacks by herdsmen in Langtang South left seventy people dead, she urged the Nigerian Federal government to improve the conditions of local roads, so as to make it possible for security forces to arrive in a timely manner. She has also called for the creation of grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen, saying: > ‚ÄúAll who eat meat should be considerate enough to let go of their land for > the source of the meat. Nigeria is blessed with enough land for everybody, > and Nigerians should be gracious enough to recognize that the meat that the > herdsman provides is for the community‚Äù. In May 2014, she led a group of protesters from Nigerians United Against Terrorism, wearing T-shirts \\"with the inscription \\"#ReleaseOurGirls.\\"\\", showing solidarity with the Nigerian military in its efforts rescue the victims of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping. One news source reports that some rally attendees received government funding. Lar has been used as an example for strong women in government, although some argue that it was because of her privilege as her father's heir that granted her this power. She has advocated for more women in government and is part of a new trend of more women in government than ever before following Nigeria's independence in 1914. She has advocated for women's rights such as age of women to marry, abortion rights, and had a hand in the bills: The abolition of all forms of discrimination against women in Nigeria and other matters bill, and the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill. In 2017 Hon. Beni Lar spoke as the House Chair for the Science and Technology Committee and urged for the advancement of sustainable, reliable power for Nigeria. She also has advocated for the option for students to choose what kind of religion they would like to learn about in school, rather than having a predetermined requirement. She presented this to the House and it was passed in part because of her point that because Nigeria is a secular state, religion and national values should be separated.

One of the first superstars of women's tennis is Suzanne Lenglen, who after six titles won at Wimbledon and the Internationaux de France leaves the amateur tennis to achieve a first professional tour in North America in 1926-1927.

Features of women's tennis In women's tennis matches the ball is usually played without effect (less than lift) and games tend to play more from the baseline; typing is generally less powerful than men. The game is made in a more tactical speed and anticipation. The service is also less powerful; it is relatively less important than for men. However, there has been a noted evolution in this field since the 1990s.

It was used by the government first as a place for punishment of debtors. Prior to the reign of the viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo, tradition holds that those unable to pay debts were either chained or approached the column on their knees, then exposed their backside to the public, stating his penance, and stating cedo bonis (I cede my goods). It has been described as the sacrificial altar of the debtor. Don Pedro of Toledo modified the tradition. In 1546, he ordered that the debtor instead had to approach the pillar and state his name, that of the lender in a clear and loud voice, and he had to stay for an hour bareheaded, embracing the column. A plaque in 1553 commemorated abolition of the former tradition. Later decrees required those who were debtors to wear certain hats with ribbons; failure to comply meant service in the galleys. In later centuries, the column was used as a site to exhibit unclaimed cadavers, and crowds came to rubberneck the bodies for spectacle.

Early days Born in Yorkshire, Smithies was living in Sheffield in 1827 when he was received into the Methodist ministry. In 1828 the Wesleyan Missionary Society appointed him as a missionary to Newfoundland where he spent nine years. In 1832 he was married to Hannah, his fianc√©e from England who assisted him in his work of \\"visiting the sick, leading classes and prayer meetings, as well as conducting the school\\".McNair, William and Rumney, Hillary. Pioneer Aboriginal Mission: The Work of Wesleyan Missionary John Smithies in the Swan River Colony 1840-1855, University of Western Australia Press, 1981. . In 1837, following sectarian tensions on the island, he returned to England for two years, including 12 months in Derbyshire. Western Australia He was assigned to Western Australia in 1839 and, aboard the Prima Donna, landed near Fremantle on 22 June 1840 with his wife and four children, one of whom had been born at sea two weeks earlier. He was immediately introduced to an established fellow missionary, Francis Armstrong. Smithies' double mandate was \\"the pastoral care of colonists and the Christianization of the Aborigines\\". Smithies established a mission near what is now Wanneroo in July 1840. The \\"Perth Native School\\" was announced with an advertisement in the Inquirer on 18 August 1841, including the Board of Management and the Rules and Regulations.Inquirer, 18 August 1841, p.6. By 1847, Smithies decided that York would be a better site for a Native Mission than Wanneroo. In 1851, an application was made to Governor Fitzgerald for 100 acres of good wheat land at York (some kilometres to the north on east side of the Avon River) ‚Äúto be held for the improvement of the Natives for ever‚Äù. There was a proviso that if there were no aborigines present, the land was to revert to the government. Smithies wrote on 26 September 1851 that eight natives and one white man had travelled to York from Wanneroo with a bullock team, a journey which had taken three days. The party set up tents and cleared ten acres of ground at the selected farm location ready for planting the next year. The mission was to be called Gerald Mission in honour of the Governor. The purpose of the mission was to train aboriginal children in farm work.Collins, Doris, The Establishment of Methodism in York, Balaardong, No 3, 2002, The York Society. On 13 November 1850, Smithies and his wife visited Eliza Brown, wife of Thomas Brown, at Grass Dale near York, and in one of her letters to her father, she said of Smithies: \\"S sat fast asleep in his chair nearly all the time of this polite visit.\\" Peter Cowan editor, A Faithful Picture, the letters of Eliza and Thomas Brown at York in the Swan River Colony 1841-1852, Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1977, p.126. In 1853, the Government granted the Mission land for the Mission, and a salary of ¬£100 a year for Smithies.Inquirer 8 June 1853, p.2. A further 8 acres were granted in the York townsite on which to build a schoolroom, a chapel and a Manse and provide Glebe lands. The Mission was even given a right of commonage, a right to graze sheep, in the township, over an area of 2000 acres on which to run ‚Äúthirty horned cattle‚Äù. This was opposed by engineer Solomon Cook who was in the process of constructing his mill in the town. So much time and labour was spent on clearing 20 to 30 acres of land and the construction of buildings, and with Rev Smithies often unavoidably away and with few others helping him, the aboriginal children drifted away from the mission school and the mission failed.Inquirer 16 March 1853, p.3. The Protector of Natives in York, Walkinshaw Cowan blamed the loss of students from the mission school to \\"yearning\\" or \\"strong particularity\\" to their own districts but also due to high death rates from influenza at the institution.CSR 230, Cowan to Colonial Secretary 3 March 1852. In all, the Wesleyan church spent ¬£12,000 on the missions to aborigines. Van Diemen's Land Smithies was transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1855 and remained there until his death in 1872.

She won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Music for her opera Angel's Bone, with libretto by Royce Vavrek. She was a 2018 Guggenheim Fellow. Du Yun was named as one of the 38 Great Immigrants by the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 2018,https://www.carnegie.org/programs/great-immigrants/ and received a 2019 Grammy nomination in the category of Best Classical Contemporary Composition for her work Air Glow.  Early life and education  Du Yun was born in Shanghai, China. She began studying piano at the age of four, attending the primary school Shanghai Conservatory of Music for piano. She studied composition at the middle school Shanghai Conservatory of Music with Deng Erbo. Du Yun later moved to the United States and graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music with a Bachelor of Music degree in composition, under Randolph Coleman, and received a Ph.D. in music composition from Harvard University, with Bernard Rands, Mario Davidovsky. On her earlier years growing up in Shanghai, Du Yun recounted, in her contribution to WQXR, that neither of her parents went to college and both were factory workers in China. She uses her whole name Du Yun, not Du, for professional and personal uses. Du Yun's music growth in China When Du Yun studied in junior high school in Shanghai, she collected cassette tapes from singer Faye Wong, Chen Sheng, Dou Wei, and Michael Jackson. She counts Dou Wei and Wang Fei (Faye Wong) the two Chinese pop musicians among who have had the most influences on her music life. She credits filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai as one of the major influences that impacted her styles. Du YunWhen she studied in high school, she began to spend pocket money to buy CDs that had beautiful album covers. Pink Floyd, Cocteau Twins, Sinead O‚ÄôConnor and Kraftwerk entered her world all at once. She indulged in Krautrock, and psychedelic rock. During her first year of college, British band Portishead released a new album, and Du Yun fell into the world of trip- hop. Her psychedelic style was later used in many of her works, and in 2012, she released her first studio album, Shark in You, which featured a variety of styles, from experimental dance music to cabaret and jazz electronic music. Director Stan Lai has collaborated with Du Yun twice. He said her music not only has the background of classical music, but also is multifaceted, influenced by pop and folk music.  Career  When Du Yun won the Pulitzer for her opera Angel's Bone in 2017, it made her the first Asian woman to win this prize in music. The opera's production in Hong Kong in 2018 won the best of the performances of the year by the South China Morning Post. From 2014-2018, Du Yun was the Artistic Director of the MATA Festival in New York City. In 2006, Du Yun joined the composition faculty at the State University of New York-Purchase. In 2017, she joined the composition faculty at Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University. She is the Professor of Composition at Peabody. In 2017, she was also appointed as the distinguished visiting professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 2020, China's leading record label Modern Sky announced its three-year record deal with Du Yun. http://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/01/WS5f4d9f90a310d95bf733ed3f.html Du Yun lives and works from New York City. = Composer = Her works include compositions for solo instruments, electroacoustic music, chamber music, orchestral works, opera, indie pop, punk, theatre, oral tradition music, sound installations, and performance art pieces. Du's works have been performed internationally in venues such as Carnegie Hall, the Guangzhou Opera House, the Salle Pleyel Paris, the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Escola de M√∫sica do Estado in S√£o Paulo, the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse in Germany, and London Southbank Centre. She has written for the New York Philharmonic, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the LA Philharmonic, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, and solo artists Hilary Hahn and Matt Haimovitz. She has been selected by the National Public Radio as one of the 100 most influential young composers under 40 in 2011. The Washington Post listed her as one of top 35 female composers in classical music. = Theatrical works = On April 10, 2017, she was awarded Pulitzer Prize for Music for her second opera, Angel's Bone. The citation for the prize reads: \\"Premiered on January 6, 2016, at the Prototype Festival, 3LD Arts and Technology Center, New York City, a bold operatic work that integrates vocal and instrumental elements and a wide range of styles into a harrowing allegory for human trafficking in the modern world. Libretto by Royce Vavrek.\\" She is the composer of the musical Dim Sum Warriors, based on a graphic novel and bilingual iPad app series about Kung Fu-fighting dumplings by the Singaporean filmmaker, satirist and cartoonist Colin Goh and Yenyen Woo. Dim Sum Warrior was made into a Chinese musical which was produced by Stan Lai. The musical debuted on Aug 11, 2017, to sold-out audiences at Theatre Above in Shanghai, and went on to tour in 25 major cities in China the following year. = As a performing artist = Du Yun at rehearsal Du Yun's performing persona on stage has been called \\"utterly extraordinary, unrestrained performance.\\" = Ok Miss ÂÆåÁæéÈîô = As a bandleader, Du Yun leads her band Ok Miss. A band with amorphous styles. According to The New Yorker, the one predictable thing about Du Yun, is her unpredictability. Dig deeper, though, and you can sense the conjoined strands of curiosity and compassion that run through everything she makes. On the first two nights of her Stone residency, her art-pop band, OK Miss, ventures through breathy Chinese pop, seductive trip-hop, and metallic skronk. = Performances in the visual art world = Du Yun has done works for the Guangzhou Triennial, The Shanghai Project, Cordoba Contemporary Arts Center, and the Sharjah Biennial. = Social causes = Du Yun is an advocate for women, racial equality and social justice. In an interview with National Public Radio on the gender issue in classical music, she said: \\"I think this is the issue ‚Äî larger and deeper than the debate of discrimination at hand. Any sustainable and viable career paths cannot and should not depend on a few people's luck.\\" Speaking to Foreign Policy on art's power in politics, she said: ‚ÄúA lot of times politics, global issues, are very black and white... There is a place for that, but it's also fantastic to have art side by side, from different viewpoints open for interpretations.‚Äù = Curatorial outputs = Du Yun founded and curated the Pan Asia Sounding Festival at National Sawdust in March 2018, as part of the Spring Revolution. ‚ÄúI want to demystify Asian culture. I want to question who owns the culture and bring together the divisions we have in society,‚Äù she told the New York News Channel PIX11. = FutureTradition = Du Yun started a global initiative FutureTradition to advocate folk arts and promote cross regional collaborations. The works are with many collaborations cross-regions. When All About Jazz covered her keynote speech for the European Jazz Conference in 2019, Ian Patterson wrote:  Critical reception  Du Yun is regarded as \\"leading force on the New York Scene,\\" \\"one of China's leading young composers.\\" Her onstage performing persona has been described as \\"adventurously eclectic\\" and \\"an indie diva with avant garde edge\\" by The New York Times. She was named one of the top 35 female composers in classical music by The Washington Post. Her album \\"Angel's Bone\\" and \\"Dinosaur Scar\\" are listed as Top Recordings of The Year in both 2017 and 2018 by the New Yorker. Her work for Jennifer Koh \\"Give Me Back My Fingerprints\\" is listed as Top 25 Classical Music Tracks of 2019 by the New York Times. In its decade review, UK's Classical FM listed her winning of Pulitzer as No.6 in \\"10 ways the 2010s changed classical music forever.\\" Rolling Stone Italia named her as one of the women composers who defined the 2010s decade.

It is a carnivorous, multi-colored wrasse that is common throughout its range. Description Halichoeres maculipinna is generally less than long. The fish is slightly elongated with a nearly symmetrical upper and lower body. It has a pointed snout and rows of small teeth in its upper and lower jaws with two sets of canines in each (at the front and corners of its mouth). Its pectoral fin has fourteen rays, its dorsal fin has eleven rays and nine spines, and its anal fin has eleven rays and three spines. Its dorsal side is yellow and is separated from its white ventral side by a black band. It has three red lines across the top of its head, and it may have a dark spot on its dorsal fin. Habitat The fish lives in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from the state of North Carolina in the United States, to the island of Bermuda and as far south as Colombia. It is also endemic to Caribbean islands such as Cuba and the Cayman Islands as well as Central American countries such as Belize. The fish was once believed to live in Brazil, but a study conducted in 2004 demonstrated that these fish belonged to a different species. Halichoeres maculipinna lives on the tops of coral reefs and in rocky areas. The fish is generally found beneath the surface. It has also been reported to live within Venezuelan Sargassum beds. Behavior =Diet= The fish is a carnivore. It primarily consumes invertebrates and ray-finned fish. =Reproduction= Like many other wrasses, the fish is a sequential hermaphrodite. It can change its sex from male to female. It mates through lek mating. During this process, males are noted to be particularly territorial. Reproduction occurs through spawning. Conservation status While a quantitative assessment of the population of Halichoeres maculipinna has not been performed, it is widespread and fairly common throughout its range. The species faces no major threats beyond occasional collection for the aquarium trade.

The character of the place was rural for a long time. Only from the 1920s did the then village develop into an industrial centre, mainly due to the lignite, also called brown coal, formed from naturally compressed peat, found in the area. The first lignite mine in the area was opened in 1924. B√∂hlen mining started near the north west of the town. The first power station was built in 1925. During World War II bomb attacks on the power station in 1944 and 1945 destroyed parts of the village.

The buildings below the church are not part of the Main Quad. The Main Quadrangle, or more commonly Main Quad or simply Quad, is the heart and oldest part of Stanford University in California. The collection of connected buildings was started in 1887 and completed in 1906. The Quad was damaged in the 1906 earthquake, repaired, less severely damaged in an 1989 earthquake, and repaired again. The exteriors have remained almost the same since the beginning, though the interiors of most of the buildings have changed radically. The Main Quad is still used for its original purposes of teaching, research, and administration.  Description  Layout of the Main Quad: A: Memorial Court B: Inner Quad courtyard C: History Corner courtyard D: Oregon Courtyard E: Geology Corner courtyard F: Math Corner courtyard G: East Gateway H: West Gateway J: Keith Memorial Terrace Agassiz and Humboldt on the building above the arches and, in front of the Quad, the sandstone balustrade with its urns. capitals of the columns will show that they differ. The Main Quad is built on a slight slope so that though the back of the structure is level with the ground, the front is elevated. It is oriented slightly east of north along the Memorial Church-Memorial Court-Palm Drive axis. The front approach is at the end of a mile-long road, Palm Drive, which leads from the main entrance onto the university grounds and is lined with Canary Island palm trees. At its southwestern (campus) end, Palm Drive becomes a one-way loop that encircles a large lawn called the Oval. Immediately in front perpendicular to Palm Drive is Jane Stanford Way (once known as Serra Mall), which is restricted to official vehicles and bicycles. Between Jane Stanford Way and the Main Quad are another lawn, some bicycle parking, a long sandstone balustrade originally built in 1902, and steps up to the level of the quad: the main steps to Memorial Court, the east steps to Wallenberg Hall (building 160), and the west steps to Jordan Hall (building 420). The Inner Quad consists of a large courtyard surrounded by twelve connected buildings (numbered clockwise, 1 through 110) and Stanford Memorial Church. Around that are 14 additional connected buildings (120 through 460) that make up the Outer Quad. The Outer Quad buildings create several additional courtyards. Memorial Court, the most important, is the front entrance of the structure. Besides the front entrance there are also the east and west entrances with gatehouses over them where they enter the inner courtyard. The four corners of the Outer Quad are named, clockwise from Memorial Court, the History Corner with its courtyard of citrus trees, the Engineering Corner with the Oregon Courtyard of flowering cherry trees,The plaque in the courtyard of the Engineering/Language corner gives the official name as \\"Oregon Courtyard\\" in honor alumni and friends who donated to the university after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. It also states that the cherry trees are a gift of the Gifu Cherry Blossom Association. Plaque checked April 26, 2015. Also see . The Gifu Cherry Blossom Association (Gifu Sakura No Kai) is a charity based in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, devoted to planting cherry trees and encouraging international cooperation, See also . the Geology Corner with a garden designed by Thomas Church, and the Math Corner. Other than Engineering, which now houses the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages (hence is often now referred to as the Language Corner), the respective disciplines are still in their corners. Besides the gardens in the minor courtyards, the main inner courtyard has eight large raised planting circles with a variety of trees and bushes. A map circa 2004 of the trees and plants in the planting circles. The Main Quad also has open covered walkways around the Inner Quad courtyard, Memorial Court, and around the exterior of the entire structure except for the main entrance, the east and west gateways, and part of the back. Each year's graduating class buries a time capsule and marks it with a plaque in the walkway around Inner Quad, starting with the class of 1896 right in front of Memorial Church (the classes of 1892 to 1895 put theirs in later); the plaques now reach nearly halfway up the western walkway. Under the west gatehouse is a time capsule and plaque marking the centennial of the opening of the university, and the cornerstone (building 60) also has a time capsule. =Points of interest= Wallenberg Hall (building 160) on east side of the front (History Corner) is named for the Wallenberg family who gave much of the money for renovating it in 1999. In the early days it housed the University library and was originally built in 1900 with funds from Thomas Welton Stanford, brother of university founder Leland Stanford and uncle of Leland Stanford Junior for whom the university is named. The second story has two white statues of Benjamin Franklin and Johannes Gutenberg. Building 420‚Äîthe corresponding building on the west side of the quad‚Äîwas named for David Starr Jordan, the first president of the university. It has statues of Louis Agassiz and Alexander von Humboldt. The original statues were created by Antonio Frilli, but Franklin and Gutenberg went missing after renovation work in 1949 and were never found; recreations were done by a local sculptor, Oleg Lobykin, and installed in 2013. In October 2020, the University announced plans to relocate the statue of Agassiz and rename Jordan Hall. Rodin's Burghers of Calais in Memorial Court Only a few of the other buildings have names. Building 200 is officially the Lane History Corner, named for Bill and Jean Lane in 1998. At about the same time Building 320 (aka Geology Corner) became Braun Corner after the Braun family and Building 260 (aka Language Corner) became Pigott Hall after the Pigott family; both families have long connections with Stanford University. Building 460 is Margaret Jacks Hall, named in 1980 for the daughter (who died in 1962 and left a bequest to the university) of David Jacks. In 1962 when it was made, her bequest was the largest single gift that the University had ever received aside from the Founding Grant. Building 120 is named McClatchy Hall. Memorial Court features several sculptures by Auguste Rodin from his grouping The Burghers of Calais.\\"Burghers of Calais, (sculpture)\\". SIRIS Adjacent to the Main Quad at the Math Corner is a casting of George Segal's Gay Liberation sculpture. The statue, consisting of four life-sized figures, was commissioned in 1979 (the 10th anniversary of the Stonewall riots) and created in 1980. It was the first piece of public art dedicated to LGBT rights. Two castings were made and originally intended for installation in New York and Los Angeles, but the statue proved too controversial for either city. The second casting was offered to Stanford, which accepted it as a long-term loan and installed it in 1984. The sculpture was vandalized several times over the next 10 years but eventually became an accepted part of the public art at Stanford. New York in 1992 finally installed the first casting in Christopher Park. Includes a picture of Gay Liberation at Stanford. Between the church and building 60 is the Amy Blue Garden with benches, a sundial, and a small birdbath dedicated to the memory of Barbara Jordan, daughter of the university's first president who died aged 9 in 1901 of scarlet fever; The inscription reads \\"Dedicated to the memory of Barbara Jordan, who knew and loved the birds, by the Western Out- Door Clubs, 1930.\\" the garden as a whole is in memory of Amy Blue, a university staffer who died in 1988 at the age of 44. Also in that area is the Frances C. Arrillaga Memorial, named after the wife of John Arrillaga; it has unusual acoustic properties. Behind the church is the Keith Memorial Terrace with its roses and fountain, designed by Thomas D. Church who created many other public spaces and gardens at Stanford, and dedicated to the memory of Captain Willard W. Keith, Jr. (class of 1941), who was killed at Guadalcanal in November 1942.Plaque on the terrace stating \\"Keith Memorial Terrace in honor of Captain Willard W. Keith, Jr. USMC, Stanford Class of 1941 Died in action at Guadalcanal, November 1942 Awarded the Navy Cross Gift of John C. Cosgrove\\"  History  Detail showing the elaborate frieze work in the stone; Inner Quad planting circles in the background Architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who created the university's first Master Plan, called for the university to be primarily housed in an inner and outer quadrangle. To design the quadrangle itself, the Stanfords in 1886 hired the firm of \\"the greatest American architect of his generation,\\" Henry Hobson Richardson. (Richardson himself had died earlier that year, and his three main associates were carrying on his work as the firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge.) This group of architects are noted for the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and features of that style including \\"round low arches, sturdy piers, massive walls, simple silhouettes, and sheltering roofs\\" are prominent in the Quad. The style was adapted to a California Mission theme. The primary building materials were local yellow sandstone and red tile roofs. The sandstone was quarried at the Graystone Quarry in San Jose, California, and transported to the building site via a private railway spur. Hundreds of laborers received the sandstone, cut it to size, dressed it, and finished it; skilled stonecutters and sculptors, primarily from Italy, installed it and embellished it with friezes. Over the objections of the architects, the Stanfords insisted that the main entrance to the Quad be \\"a large memorial arch with an enormously large approach\\". The arch was built and was topped with an elaborate frieze representing \\"The Progress of Civilization in America\\"; however, the arch was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was not rebuilt. The arch at the entrance to the Main Quad shortly after the 1906 earthquake. It was never rebuilt nor was the steeple on the church in the background. The cornerstone was laid at what is now Building 60 on May 14, 1887, which would have been Leland Stanford Junior's 19th birthday. The Inner Quad was mostly finished (except for the church) by the time the university opened in 1891. The Outer Quad and Memorial Church were completed by 1906, but the entire structure was severely damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Restoration of the Quad began immediately, but several original features of the Quad that collapsed in the earthquake were never rebuilt: the huge Memorial Arch over the entrance to Memorial Court, and a spire on Memorial Church. The Quad, which was originally built of unreinforced masonry, has been seismically retrofitted several times since then. The award given was the Governor's Historic Preservation Award and the article mentions that the university had spent $250 million dollars in the previous 10 years in retrofitting buildings including the Main Quad's Memorial Church, and buildings 30, 260 (Pigott Hall aka Language Corner), and 320 (Braun Corner aka Geology Corner). The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake also damaged some of the Quad buildings. Language Corner and Geology Corner were closed for repairs for more than five years; most of that time was spent negotiating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over paying for the repairs. Memorial Church was also damaged but was repaired more quickly via private donations. In 2020, the Stanford Department of Psychology and student- led groups began the process to rename Jordan Hall because of David Starr Jordan's association with the eugenics movement. Most of the University's other, more recent buildings echo the Quad's basic pattern of buff-colored walls, red roofs, and arcades, giving Stanford's campus its distinctive look. The original university plan was to add additional quadrangles of buildings, initially to the left and right of the Main Quad. However, this part of the plan was put aside for many decades until the Science and Engineering Quad was built to the west, starting in the 1980s and completed in 2013.  Current use  The Main Quad now houses many departments and classrooms and also the offices of the President, Provost, and administrative offices of the School of Humanities and Sciences. The main courtyard is used for University functions, in particular the Baccalaureate service held on the day before the main graduation ceremony, departmental graduation ceremonies, and the annual alumni reunion dinner. A long-standing tradition is Full Moon in the Quad. In its oldest form it was an event at which \\"a Stanford girl becomes a Stanford woman ... when kissed by a senior man in front of Memorial Church under the light of a full moon\\"; now it is a party with much kissing held on the first full moon of the school year.  Namesakes *The university's annual yearbook is called the Stanford Quad. *The Stanford Historical Society's journal is called Sandstone and Tile, named for the materials from which the Quad is built.

Clark then returned to New Zealand, and was appointed as a senior lecturer in politics at Victoria University of Wellington. She was promoted to professor in 1978, and served as the dean of commerce and administration between 1980 and 1982. From 1980 to 1985, Clark served as a human rights commissioner. She was conferred with the title of emeritus professor by Victoria University in 2010. Honours In the 1993 New Year Honours, Clark was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to education. She was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, also for services to education, in the 2007 New Year Honours. Following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government in 2009, she accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In 2012, the Margaret Clark Prize for Victoria University of Wellington honours politics students was established in her name.

His band includes Sean Merrell (drums, vocals), Whit Sibley (bass, vocals) and Ian O'Dougherty (producer, guitar, piano). Cooke has collaborated with many Denver area musicians: Isaac Slade of The Fray, Paper Bird, Laura Goldhamer, The Gamits, Andy Thomas, Esme Patterson, Julie Davis and Joseph Pope III from Nathaniel Rateliff's band, and others. Cooke has shared the stage with artists such as Crooked Fingers, Flaming Lips, Dresden Dolls, Rasputina, Blonde Redhead, Paper Bird, Devotchka, Wovenhand, Shenandoah Davis, The Lumineers and The Head & The Heart, among others  History  Cooke was born in Adelaide, Australia, and grew up in Greeley, Colorado, learning to play the piano at age five and cello at eleven. In 2000, Cooke met Ian ODougherty of the Denver, Colorado band Uphollow and relocated to Denver to join the band and play piano and cello on Uphollow's 2002 album, Ten Fingers. Along with ODougherty, bassist Whit Sibley, and drummer Justin Ferreira, they then wrote and recorded 2005's Jackets For The Trip, which included four of Cooke's songs. The album was recorded and mixed by O'Dougherty, with a master and 5.1 surround sound mix by Robert Ferbrache, mix engineer for 16 Horsepower, Wovenhand, Slim Cessna's Auto Club, The Frantix, The Fluid, and others ‚Äì along with visuals for all of the songs by Zach Putnam. Westword's Jason Heller said the album was \\"flush with a baroque, folk-pop lushness\\" Wanting to establish his own songwriting identity, he start playing solo shows and released a five-song EP in 2005. In 2007, Cooke released his first full-length, The Fall I Fell. Produced by O'Dougherty, and mixed with Robert Ferbrache, the album built an audience for Cooke in Colorado which he started to extend with consistent touring. The album was well received. Dave Herrera, of Westword, said \\"If Sufjan Stevens had been weaned on nothing but recordings by Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Bach and \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" his take on chamber pop might sound something like Cooke's work. But as it stands, Cooke makes Stevens' elaborate compositions seem almost prosaic.\\" In 2008, he continued to tour and played cello on Crooked Fingers Forfeit/Fortune album, alongside Neko Case and Tom Hagerman of Devotchka. The Fall I Fell received a DVD release in 2009, adding a surround mix by Robert Ferbrache, along with music videos and live footage. The Denver Post said \\"The record flirted with Rufus Wainwright-style orchestral blasts that backed Cooke's dexterous vocals, which jumped octaves with enviable precision.\\" In 2011, he contributed two songs to a Joanna Newsom cover album, Versions of Joanna, alongside Billy Bragg, M. Ward, Ben Sollee, Owen Pallett, and many others. Soon after, he released his second album, Fortitude. In 2012 he collaborated with Denver-based children's choir 303 Choir to produce a new version of Cooke's song \\"Rover\\". The collaboration was documented by 1930pictures and Ian ODougherty and released via a screening, and then hosted on vimeo and Colorado Public Radio. In October 2013 he released an animated video for one of the songs from Fortitude, \\"Cassowary & Fruit Bat\\". The release also featured a 44-page book, including a documentary about the making of the song and the animated video, along with over two hours of video from other songs on Fortitude, as well as from The Fall I Fell. Animator Adam Singer describes the process, as well as Cooke, O'Dougherty, Sibley, and Merrell. In early 2014 he and his band collaborated with modern dance company Wonderbound on a series of performances of the show \\"Gone West\\". His long-awaited Dinosaur concept album was released in September 2015, with Westword Magazine calling Antiquasauria \\"...the years most ambitious Denver album\\". In April of 2017, Cooke re- released The Fall I Fell including a new surround mix and live footage. In October of the same year, The Flight I Flew was released in conjunction with a live dance collaboration with Denver-based dance company Wonderbound.  Recognition  \\"Cooke, his cello and his looping effects pedal are now fixtures ‚Äî icons, even ‚Äî in Denver's thriving independent music community.\\" - Ricardo Baca, The Denver Post Spin (magazine) called Cooke \\"a one-man chamber ensemble.\\" \\"Ian Cooke specializes in forlorn folk built on cello-heavy arrangements and vocals that mimic his instrument's mournful modulations. His music's got its freakier moments, but Cooke's ambitious complex compositions mark him as kindred spirit to Sufjan Stevens and Joanna Newsom.\\" \\"astonishingly talented cellist/songwriter from Denver\\", writes KEXP DJ and musician Sean Nelson Colorado Public Radio said of Fortitude: \\"It‚Äôs a marvelous, sophisticated effort with at least one song about dinosaurs.\\" Cooke developed a dedicated following within the Denver music community.

Typically this pertains to IACUCs. In protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, 'Correct Conduct of Full-Committee and Designated- Member Protocol Reviews', there are two ways a procedure or protocol can be reviewed, according to PHS policy.DMR & FCR, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare - Topic Index, Protocol Review Sometimes a protocol or amendment to policies is submitted, which may not need to be considered at a full meeting. If everyone on the committee agrees, then the Chair or the committee can assign a person of knowledge and selected other member(s) to review the protocol and approve it or send it back to the full committee for discussion. A first step in such a process is for the chair to poll committee members to determine agreement for the DMR.

The Three Rs (3Rs) in relation to science are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959.Russell, W.M.S. and Burch, R.L., (1959). The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, Methuen, London. The 3Rs are - #Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. #Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. #Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided. In many countries, these 3Rs are now explicit in legislation governing animal use.  Bibliography  * William Russell and Rex Burch (1959) The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique.

The club was founded in 1911, and its clubhouse was known as Woodlea, a 140-room Vanderbilt mansion owned by Colonel Elliott Fitch Shepard and his wife Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard. It was built in 189295 at a cost of $2 million ($ in ) and was designed by the architectural firm McKim, Mead & White; the estate became a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District (on the National Register of Historic Places) in 1984. Woodlea's exterior was designed in an Italian Renaissance Revival style, incorporating Beaux-Arts details. The building's facades are composed primarily of buff-colored Italian brick. The south and west facades are symmetrical, but the overall plan of the house is not. The house's west facade is the longest and most ornate, and has a view of the Hudson River from its west-facing windows and adjoining terrace. The main entrance is on the building's south, directly approached from the south drive. The interior also has significant features, including marble fireplaces, coffered ceilings, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail. The house has between of interior space, making it one of the largest privately owned houses in the United States. Club Golfing at the club, c. 1920 The club currently has and a 27-hole golf course with tree-limb footbridges. Facilities include the main clubhouse, a pool complex, ten Har-Tru tennis courts, four aluminum heated platform tennis courts, four squash courts, eighteen guest rooms, skeet and trap areas, a 45-horse boarding facility, twenty paddocks, a large indoor riding arena, pro shops for golf and paddle sports, a fitness complex, the golf course and practice range (non-contributing), outdoor riding rings, stables, and a carriage house. Youth activities include golf, tennis, squash and riding. The clubhouse has three dining rooms, and altogether the club can hold 400 guests. The club currently has 570 members, and a staff consisting of 60 year-round employees and 200 during the height of the season. The stables have a tack room, fifty stalls, and two indoor arenas, and they host the Sleepy Hollow Stable and Riding Academy. The club's gross revenue is $12 million; of it, $2.5 million is from food and beverage sales. The club property surrounds Saint Mary's Episcopal Church on three sides and slopes upwards east from U.S. Route 9. The clubhouse, which is open through every season of the year, sits on a wide central plateau. Notable early members included George G. Haven, V. Everit Macy, George W. Perkins, Moses Taylor, Oakleigh Thorne, and Frank Vanderlip; notable current members include Bill Murray, James Patterson, and several members of the Rockefeller family. History Woodlea's riverfront facade =Name= Sleepy Hollow Country Club, founded in 1911, predates the 1996 renaming of the neighboring village of North Tarrytown to Sleepy Hollow. The club is named after its location in the river valley of the Pocantico River, a river which was once called Slapershaven (\\"sleepers' harbor\\" in Dutch); the Dutch name later grew to apply to the valley. Today, as a geographic term, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" refers only to the incorporated village. =19th century= Map of the country club, 1931 Sleepy Hollow's clubhouse was once a private residence named Woodlea. The mansion retained the name of a former house of J. Butler Wright (son of Benjamin Wright), who lived there and called it Woodlea; it dates to around 1806. Wright's Victorian house, of painted brick with porches and a high tower on one end, was later renamed the Villa. The current property was originally made up of various farms. Colonel Elliott Fitch Shepard came to the Briarcliff area in the early 1890s, and having purchased the house and its property, ordered construction of the existing house and improvements to the grounds. Construction on the mansion began in 1892, and it was completed in 1895. In 1892 Shepard ordered the construction of Scarborough's first dock (at the present Scarborough Park) to allow construction materials to be shipped to his property. Shepard died in 1893, leaving his wife Margaret to oversee the completion of Woodlea. After his death, Margaret lived there only during spring and autumn, with less frequent trips as time went on. In November 1896, Maria Louisa Kissam (Margaret's mother and widow of William Henry Vanderbilt) died in the house. Maria's sister and Margaret called for a Scarborough doctor who was unable to assist her. On September 11, 1906, New York businessman Archibald S. White purchased the then- property from Mrs. Shepard for between $1 and 1.5 million. He bought it as a present for his wife Olive Celeste Moore White; together they lived on the property. The house and property's worth at the time was estimated between $4 and 6 million, and it was often said that its owners didn't know how much money had been spent constructing and improving the estate. Around 1910, Frank Vanderlip and William Rockefeller purchased the estate. Vanderlip thought of it as too big of a bargain to pass up ‚Äì it was offered for only $165,000 ($ in ). Narcissa Vanderlip thought the house too large and grand to live in, and so the Vanderlip family remained in their nearby property of Beechwood. =20th century to the present= The two men assembled a board of directors to form a country club, including future Titanic victim John Jacob Astor IV, coal baron Edward Julius Berwind, cotillion leaders Elisha Dyer and Lispenard Stewart, and sportsmen W. Averell Harriman, Cornelius Vanderbilt III, and Harrison A. Williams. The country club was incorporated on May 11, 1911, with 600 members. The directors' first meeting took place at Vanderlip's office at 55 Wall St., the National City Bank Building (Vanderlip was the president of the bank at the time). Initiation and yearly dues were each $100 ($ in ). For the first few years, the club rented Woodlea for $25,000 ($ in ) a year, and in 1912 the club purchased the property from Vanderlip and Rockefeller for $350,000 ($ in ). The club then constructed the golf course in close harmony to the existing lawns, and also built an outdoor garden theater with clipped cedars and a 16th-century Italian portal. The club ended up paying $310,000 for the land and house, and spent another $100,000 on improvements. The club spent four years, starting in 1910, rearranging the house's kitchen, pantries, and service wing to house and serve more people, and in renovating one of the stables into a garage. The club also constructed more tennis courts and a toboggan slide for use in the winter. The grounds and Italian garden had been designed by the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted from 1895 to 1901, including long stretches of lawns and using American and foreign trees; the club had Charles B. Macdonald and Seth Raynor design the first golf course in 1911, and A. W. Tillinghast designed an update in 1935, succeeded by Gil Hanse's redesign from 18 to 27 holes around 2008. In 1916, golf course architect Devereux Emmet and his son Devereux Emmet Jr. won the father-son tournament at Sleepy Hollow Country Club. This prompted the United States Golf Association to institute the \\"architects rule\\" that barred golf course architects from competing as amateurs in tournaments. In 1917 the club had 1,000 members, and its president was Frank Vanderlip. In June of that year, William Rockefeller purchased for the club, bringing its area to (the house was originally sold with only ). Rockefeller spent $600,000 ($ in ), making it the largest single real estate transaction in the county. The purchases allowed for the construction of about 40 houses on the club property. New facilities were built in the 1920s, including a manager's house, skeet house, squash house, indoor riding ring, and swimming pool. The club had operated at a loss from the beginning, and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, club members were not successful in maintaining their wealth, and membership declined. Cuts were made ‚Äì horses were sold, Woodlea was closed except for special occasions, and the golf house became the primary clubhouse. building lots north of Woodlea were sold to members. In 1933, notable amateur golfer Bobby Jones played at the course. The club was also not successful during World War II and later; in 1950 a member could stay overnight at Woodlea for $5 ($ in ), and for less in the golf house. The first formal dance that year also cost $5 a person. In 1961, in time for the club's 50th anniversary, Woodlea was redecorated with more modern fabrics, warm gold and forest green carpets, dropped lighting, and some lowered ceilings. Hillside Italian garden, c. 1906 Original to the house, and occupying its northwest terrace against its service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it characteristics of a hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying a portion of the slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly overgrown with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house. The garden was demolished in the 1960s, as was the golf house (in 1967). In the garden's location and replacing the use of the golf house, a wing was added to the clubhouse, constructed on the northeast terrace and completed in 1962. The building holds a pro shop, dining facilities, and locker rooms. The structure was designed to be spacious and convenient and not be noticeable from the grounds below, although from Woodlea, the sight of the tar roof and ventilators was noted to be worse than the prior standing gardens. The club hosted the NYNEX Commemorative from 1986 to 1993. In 1989, professional golfer Bob Charles set a current record when he won the tournament. In 2002, the club hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur Golf Championship. In 2014 the country club expanded and renovated the snack bar building, renovated the locker room building exterior, constructed a large array of solar panels on the roof of the locker room and dining facility building, and performed other renovations. Replacing the golf house's location, a pool facility and tennis shop was constructed in 1968. Architecture =Woodlea= Southwest view, 1895 The architect of Woodlea is variously stated as McKim, Mead & White, and Stanford White, although according to William Mitchell Kendall in his 1920 list of the firm's works, he attributes the house's design to McKim, Mead & White, with W. R. Mead as the supervising architect. Mead was rarely involved in architectural design in the partnership, making his design of Woodlea and another Vanderbilt house, Florham, unusual. He was related to Shepard, as Mead's sister was married to Shepard's brother. Exterior Woodlea was likely modeled after Kimberley Hall in Norfolk Woodlea's exterior was designed in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house is said to have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is a full- blown expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture ‚Äì the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and guest rooms on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and of a size larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the rest of the house, this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy. Woodlea is constructed of buff-colored pressed Italian brick with pale limestone trim. It is three stories tall, seven bays wide, and more than fourteen bays deep. The south and west facades are both symmetrical, although the house has an asymmetrical overall plan. The house has pedimented pavilions and entrance porticos on the west, south, and east; window trim consisting of stone surrounds, pediments, lintels, and sills; classical balusters and quoins. The house's third story is separated visually by a stone string course and is topped with a modillioned cornice. From a shallow hipped roof rise brick chimneys that are trimmed and capped with stone. The pavilion pediments have decorative urn-shaped elements. The house's windows are primarily rectangular, double hung, one-over-one panel style, except for a large triple Palladian window, which has stained glass and is situated midway up the house's main staircase, illuminating its lower steps. The house has distinctive quoins, pediments, and classical balustrades of pale gray limestone. The west facade of the house is the most ornate, and faces the Hudson River, with a view of the river from its terrace and west- facing windows. The curtain wall between the facade's pavilions contains a semicircular portico, and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-coch√®re, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a portico of Ionic columns over the entranceway. The house has been described as \\"low and spreading, notwithstanding its unusual height\\". It has between , making it one of the largest houses in the U.S. The property has about three miles of wide driveways. Interior The house also has significant interior features, including marble fireplaces, wood paneling, coffered ceilings, window and door architraves, parquet floors, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail, primarily in the Adamesque mold. The original furnishings together were reported in 1895 to have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and to have included rare tapestries, carved woods, paintings, and Italian marble. In 1906, the house had 16 bathrooms and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from various parts of the world. The first room from the corridor was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, sometimes referred to as the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors. The dining room had a high wainscot of mahogany, paneled in rectangles, above which is a broad tapestry frieze. The ceiling is beamed with closely set beams, and the cornice is mahogany like the other woodwork. The room is lighted by the cluster of lights applied to the wainscot. The house's pantry was \\"as large as many New York apartments\\", had a counter and wash bowls and large rows of glazed closets around other walls. The kitchen and serving room had a refrigerator and were well stocked and equipped. The breakfast room was green and white, with woodwork painted white and walls covered in Nile green cloth; it had a wood mantel with facings of mottled white marble, also imported from Italy. Adjoining is the morning-room, finished in quartered oak, with walls papered in red stripes of two shades, has a quartered oak wainscot and white cornice, curtains and furniture are red and gold. The library, currently a banquet hall The library is on the right of the hall, removed from the other rooms; it once held a billiard table. The walls are lined with tall bookcases containing rare books; the walls were otherwise covered in large square panel-like pieces of leather. The room has a richly coffered ceiling and had green and brown curtains. The house has bedrooms of various sizes, most large, with Mrs. Shepard's the biggest. Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate to rich decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture inlaid with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom. The house's room arrangement was planned for convenience and comfort, as compared to typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled in terms of the height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels. =Stable= The club's stable The golf and tennis house (c. 1931), originally the residence of J. Butler Wright The club's entranceway and south gatehouse The stable was designed by McKim, Mead & White and built in the late 19th century using the same yellow brick used for the main residence. The stable is two and a half stories high, 29 bays wide, and 5 bays deep, and it has a gable roof covered with asbestos shingles that replaced its original ceramic tile. On the roof's ridge sits a shallow monitor, flanked by two taller octangular monitors with louvered ventilating elements and bell-cast copper roofs. The end bays of the west (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have recessed brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance with a pair of oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters. Fenestration at the main facade's lower level is only narrow wood-framed double-hung glazed embrasures with two-over-two sash. The facades have a denticulated cornice, repeated within the pediments and arched pavilion lintels. The stable is built into a hill, and has a partial basement level with 51 stalls. The two-story interior space on the first floor was originally used for carriages and then for automobiles, and now is used as an indoor exercising ring for the horses occupying the stalls below. In the end pavilions, there is a reception area, tack room, and small apartment designed to be occupied by the riding instructor. =Golf house= In the 1920s, the old Butler Wright house became the golf house. It was at the center of the club's sporting operations, originally holding a pro shop, dining room, bar, and bedrooms. In 1931, it was refurbished with more showers and dressing rooms, an addition to the locker room to double its space and increase the lounge space, an enlarged kitchen, a new women's locker room and sitting room, a larger dining veranda, an enclosed porch on the northwest corner of the building, and a new porch on the building's east side. The club's first pool was constructed adjoining the house in 1930, necessitating the construction of the showers and dressing rooms. The building was demolished in 1967. =Gatehouses= Both of the country club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were constructed along with the house in the 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea in materials and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable roofs and a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have stone and brick pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower- level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved stone and ironwork. =Pool house= The pool house was built in 1968 and is brick with wood-framed casement windows. It is a divided brick building with locker rooms on the larger west section and a refreshment area on the smaller east section. The west section has a flat roof, and the east section has a shallow hipped roof with a broad overhang. The building does not contribute to the former historic estate. =Skeet house= The skeet house was built around 1925, and is a small one-story log building, three bays wide and one bay deep with a gable roof. The interior is rustic, with a small kitchen and one large multi-purpose room. The building contributes to the estate's early 20th century development. =Logan Memorial Riding Ring= The riding ring The building, originally named the Logan Riding Ring, was completed in 1929. Mrs. Thomas F. Logan, an Ardsley resident and member of the Sleepy Hollow Riding Committee, funded the building's $300,000 expense ($ in ) and supervised its construction. The building has a length of 180 feet and a width of 95 feet. Its exterior is stucco over concrete block; the building has a main section with a round- arched asbestos-shingled roof, and is two stories high, five bays wide (), and ten bays deep (). The building has narrow metal-framed tripartite casement windows with brick sills. The upper, eight-light sections of the windows open horizontally, and the lower portions with sixteen lights open vertically; the central twenty-light sections are fixed. The structure's bays are divided on the side facades by sloping concrete ground-to-cornice buttresses, paired at the intersections of the side and rear facades. Around 1931, an exhibition ring and corrals were constructed near the riding ring. The main (west) facade has a projecting two and a half-story gable roof section that is three bays wide and two deep. Decorative detail on the exterior includes quoins, the James Gibbs-inspired surround on the main entrance, and the molded surrounds and keystones of the casement windows. In the northwest corner of the intersection between the building's two sections is a one-story-high, one-bay- square addition with a narrow metal casement window on the west facade and a large double entrance for horses on the north. The building's interior consists of a large riding ring that is open to the rafters, and in the gable- roofed section, there are lockers and changing rooms on the first floor and a multi-purpose room on the second; on one of its walls is a floor-to-ceiling window permitting view of the ring activity below. =Squash house= The squash house was constructed around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was located near the Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended the length of the main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and- lintel stone element, which was at the center of the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled. =Former manager's house= The former manager's house The manager's house was built of brick and stucco around 1920. It is two stories high, four bays wide, two bays deep, and has an asymmetrical plan. The building has a shallow hip roof with exposed rafter ends. Its windows are primarily one-over-one and double-hung with wood trim, with window-sills made of concrete. There is a three-story rectangular brick tower set into the main (west) facade. The tower is open at the top beneath a wide wood fascia. The building has a brick chimney decorated with corbelling; its chimney coping and caps are made of concrete. The building is now rented to the members. =Carriage barn complex= Carriage barn complex The carriage barn complex predates the Shepards' ownership of the property; it was built around 1875 as part of Wright's original estate. The most prominent component is the brick carriage house, which was designed by McKim, Mead & White. It is made of brick with granite trim and is one and a half stories high, ten bays wide and three bays deep. It has a steeply pitched slate hip roof with spring eaves and exposed rafters. At the roof's ridge sits an octagonal ventilating element with a bell-cast roof. On the main (north) facade, there is a two-bay-wide projection with a hip roof and two wall dormers. There is a large roof dormer on the side (east) facade which provides exterior access to the hayloft. Other fenestration includes small square windows with fixed sashes near the eaves on all facades and four double-hung windows, two per level, in the main facade's pavilion. Each end facade has a set of large double wood carriage doors. The complex now serves as a storage and maintenance facility for the club's golf carts. Opposite the carriage barn is another building, also of brick but with a low hip roof. It is one story high, one bay deep and five bays wide. There are three sets of overhead doors on the main (south) facade of the building. A high brick wall encloses the entire complex, and sections of the corner utility structures are a part of the surrounding wall. There is a small building in the northeast corner of the complex; it is one bay square with a steep hip roof with spring eaves. It has single round windows near the root line, on two facades. The building's entrance, on the south facade, is made of wood. The building has a counterpart across the yard, with a low hip roof, a large brick chimney, and a stone water table and string course; it has overhead doors on the north facade. Popular culture In the 201112 television show Pan Am, Sleepy Hollow Country Club was the setting for much of the series' third episode. Other media filmed at the country club include the 2012 show 666 Park Avenue, the 20092016 show The Good Wife, the 2009 film The Six Wives of Henry Lefay, the 200613 show 30 Rock, the 2009 television special Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist, the 2010 film The Bounty Hunter, the music video of Beyonc√©'s 2011 song \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\", the 2015present Netflix show Daredevil, and the 2014present Fox show Gotham. The club also stood in for the Biltmore and Ritz hotels in the 2017 Amazon Video series Z: The Beginning of Everything. It was also used in season 2 of ABC's 2015present show Quantico. The club's interior and exterior were used throughout three seasons of CBS's 2014present show Madam Secretary. The production team for the 2017 film The Greatest Showman used the club as a base for filming much of the film.

Most notable among these films are Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, for which he was nominated for the 1976 BAFTA Award for Best Editing, and Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff, for which he and his editing team won the 1983 Oscar for Best Film Editing. Other notable films he edited include WarGames, Jacob's Ladder, Heat and The Horse Whisperer. A member of the American Cinema Editors (ACE) since the mid-1950s, Rolf served two terms as president of that guild. He also served on the Board of Governors at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for five terms (15 years), representing the editing branch from 1992 through 2007. He received the ACE Career Achievement Award in 2003. Rolf's age when he died is incorrect in the headline. Personal life Ernst R. Rolf was born in Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden on New Year's Eve, 1931, the son of actor Ernst Rolf and Norwegian-born actress Tutta Rolf. After his father's death in 1932, Tutta married American director and choreographer Jack Donohue, who advised the young Ernst to go into film editing. Rolf worked as a ski patrolman and was a seaman for the Norwegian Merchant Marine before emigrating to the United States, after which he spent three years in the United States Marine Corps. He considered pursuing a career as a film director like his step-father, but Donohue convinced him to first try his hand at film editing, telling him he would \\"learn everything about directing by being a film editor first.\\" On July 14, 2014, Rolf died at his home in France due to complications following hip surgery. He was 82. Editing career =Early years, Levy- Gardiner-Laven and first films of the '70s= At the start of his career, Rolf spent a then-required eight years serving as an apprentice and assistant editor. One of Rolf's earliest jobs as an editor was the 1959 Swedish-American co-production Space Invasion of Lapland. Among the films he worked on as an assistant editor was Levy-Gardner-Laven's 1962 Western Geronimo. Levy-Gardner- Laven later made Rolf one of the head editors of their 1965 Western, The Glory Guys; Rolf's editing partner on this film was Melvin Shapiro, with whom Rolf would work again on Taxi Driver over ten years later. When Levy-Gardner-Laven began production on the Western television series The Big Valley, they brought in Rolf to serve as one of the editors of the show. He edited nine episodes of the first season, which ran from 1965-1966. At the start of the second season, in 1966, he became the show's editorial coordinator, a position he held until the series ended in 1969. In 1967, starting with the third season of The Big Valley, he took on the name \\"Tom Rolf.\\" Rolf's first feature film as a solo editor was another Levy-Gardner-Laven production, the 1967 Elvis Presley picture Clambake. Rolf worked on a few more Levy-Gardner-Laven productions, including the 1970 releases Underground (which, like Clambake, was directed by Arthur H. Nadel) and The McKenzie Break. The latter was the first of four films Rolf would edit for director Lamont Johnson; their subsequent collaborations were The Last American Hero (1973), Visit to a Chief's Son (1974) and the 1975 TV movie Fear on Trial. Rolf also edited two 1973 releases for Richard C. Sarafian: Lolly-Madonna XXX and The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing. =Mid-to-late 1970s: Scorsese, Schrader and Frankenheimer= The turning point in Rolf's career came in 1975 when he and Melvin Shapiro were recruited by director Martin Scorsese to edit his crime drama Taxi Driver. Released in 1976, Taxi Driver was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and has come to be considered one of the greatest films of all time. The film also received three BAFTA Awards and four BAFTA nominations, including one for Rolf, Shapiro, and Marcia Lucas for Best Editing. Scorsese hired Rolf again for his next film, the 1977 musical New York, New York, before Scorsese began working with his regular editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. Paul Schrader, the writer of Taxi Driver, was so impressed with Rolf that he hired him for his directorial debut, the 1978 drama film Blue Collar, and recruited Rolf again for his second feature, Hardcore. Rolf also edited three films for director John Frankenheimer in the mid-to-late 1970s: French Connection II (1975), Black Sunday (1977) and Prophecy (1979). =The 1980s and beyond= After co-editing Michael Cimino's infamous box office flop Heaven's Gate, Rolf joined the editing team of Philip Kaufman's space race drama The Right Stuff. The film was a critical (if not commercial) success and picked up four Academy Awards, including Best Editing for Rolf and his fellow editors, Glenn Farr, Lisa Fruchtman, Stephen A. Rotter and Douglas Stewart. Rolf and the Right Stuff editing team were also nominated for an \\"Eddie\\" Award from American Cinema Editors (ACE). Although they did not win the award, Rolf himself won that year for his solo work on John Badham's WarGames. According to editor Mark Goldblatt, Rolf's very first cut of WarGames so satisfied Badham that the director signed off on it immediately with no additional notes for the editor. Badham later recruited Rolf for his 1987 crime-comedy Stakeout, though this time the editor was paired up with Michael Ripps. For director Adrian Lyne, Rolf edited 1986's 9¬Ω Weeks and 1990's Jacob's Ladder. The latter is considered by some, including author and film scholar Vincent LoBrutto, to be a landmark in film editing due to the intricacies and complexities involved in cutting the picture and because it \\"furthered the montage style of editing and allowed filmmakers to strive for new forms.\\" In 2010, Rolf told The Hollywood Reporter that Jacob's Ladder was the film he enjoyed working on the most, stating he was \\"very proud of that one.\\" Rolf also edited or co-edited two films each for Douglas Day Stewart (Thief of Hearts and Quicksilver) and Alan J. Pakula (The Pelican Brief and The Devil's Own). Additionally, he edited two television productions for Lawrence Schiller: the 1981 movie The Executioner's Song and the 2000 miniseries Perfect Murder, Perfect Town. Other notable films which were edited or co- edited by Rolf include Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989), Michael Mann's Heat (1995), Robert Redford's The Horse Whisperer (1998), John Woo's Windtalkers and Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium (both 2002). In 2003, Rolf re-teamed with Blue Collar and Hardcore director Paul Schrader to work on Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. It was released in 2005, though Rolf did not receive on-screen credit. The last film Rolf edited was the Russian Alexander Kolchak biopic Admiral, released in 2008.

The name of this unidentified artist is derived from a series of 44 prints of landscapes that were created after the artist‚Äôs drawings, some of which have been preserved. Together with the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the drawings of the Master played an important role in the evolution of Northern Renaissance landscape art from the world landscape into an independent genre. Publication history The prints were published by Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp in two series. The first series was published in 1559 with the title Multifarium casularum ruriumque lineamenta curiose ad vivum expressa (translated as: 'Many and very beautiful places of diverse village dwellings, homesteads, files, streets, and such like, and furnished with all sorts of small animals. Altogether drawn from life and primarily located around Antwerp'). The first series contained 14 sheets. Tower on a river, published by Claes Jansz. Visscher The second series was published in 1561 with the title Praediorum villarum et rusticarum caularum icons elegantissimi ('Elegant pictures of country manours, villas and cottages drawn from life in copper plates').Leopoldine van Hogendorp Prosperetti, 'Landscape and Philosophy in the Art of Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625)', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009 The second series contained 30 sheets. An edition of both volumes together also appeared 1561. A third edition was published by Philips Galle in 1601 in Antwerp under the title Regiunculae et villae aliquot ducatus Brabantiae a. P. Breughelio delineatae et in pictorum gratiam a Nicolao Joannis Piscatore excusae et in lucem editae, Amstelodami ('Small Counties and Villages primarily in the duchy of Brabant'). His son Theodoor Galle published the series again a few years later (probably in 1610). In 1612 Claes Jansz. Visscher published a further edition of 26 of the original 44 views in Amsterdam.Hans M. Schmidt, et al. \\"Masters, anonymous, and monogrammists, ¬ßI: Master of the Small Landscapes\\", Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 Jun. 2014 Visscher created a new title page and added two additional prints at the end of the series. The first two editions by Cock were not particularly successful but the 1601 Galle edition, on the other hand, was quite successful. Attribution of the drawings and prints The publications of Cock did not name the artist responsible for the designs. The original title page only stated that the landscapes were drawn from nature in the vicinity of Antwerp.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012 Philips Galle's 1601 edition attributed the designs to Cornelis Cort while Claes Jansz. Visscher described them as 'some country farms and cottages of the duchy of Brabant, drawn by P. Bruegel'. These attributions to Cort and Bruegel are now generally regarded as unsubstantiated. Village road with flock of sheep, published by Hieronymus Cock The following candidates have been proposed for identification with the Master of the Small Landscapes: Hieronymus Cock, Cornelis van Dalem, Hans Bol and .Meester van de Kleine Landschappen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Some scholars have divided the authorship of the Small Landscapes drawings between two or more artists. Others believe the artist to be an unknown, independent master. The original prints were probably engraved by Jan and Lucas van Doetechum. The later Dutch reprint contained engravings by Claes Jansz. Visscher himself as the original plates for the series had remained in Antwerp in the possession of the Galle publishing house. Visscher made changes to the original prints by reducing their size, cropping the images and making alterations to the staffage. He changed or moved the original figures and added new figures.Alexandra Onuf, Envisioning Netherlandish Unity: Claes Visscher's 1612 Copies of the Small Landscape Prints, in: Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art, Volume 3: Issue 1 (2011) The drawings Many of the drawings that formed the basis for the series of prints have been preserved and are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and Chatsworth House. Art historical significance Village View, ink on paper The works of the Master of the small landscapes constitute an important link in the evolution of the landscape into an independent genre. The landscape as developed in the first half of the 16th century by Netherlandish artists such as Joachim Patinir is referred to as 'world landscape'. These world landscapes represented imaginary panoramic landscapes seen from an elevated viewpoint and usually included a Biblical or historical narrative. Pieter Bruegel the Elder‚Äôs 'Large Landscapes' published by Hieronymus Cock in the mid 1550s included non-narrative world landscapes as well as religious subjects. A further evolution was the series of 'Landscapes with Biblical and Mythological Scenes' published in 1558 by Hieronymus Cock after designs by his brother Matthys Cock. This series showed that there was an increased interest in landscapes with serious subjects but without any need for consistency of either religious or mythological themes. A Flemish village, ink on paper The series of the Small Landscapes was published the next year. Rather than the imaginary, distant landscapes with religious content of the world landscape, the series consisted of close-up renderings at eye-level of identifiable country estates and villages populated with figures engaged in daily activities. By abandoning the panoramic viewpoint of the world landscape and focusing on the humble, rural and even topographical, the Small Landscapes set the stage for Netherlandish landscape painting in the 17th century. The Small Landscapes depicted real rather than imaginary landscapes and some of their subjects have been identified.E. L√∂ffler, 'A Subject of the Small Landscapes Series Identified', Print Quarterly 28 (2011), p. 46-49 After the publication of the Small Landscapes, landscape artists either continued with the world landscape or followed the new mode presented by the Small Landscapes. This evolution in the representation of the landscape reflected a shift in the clientele for art towards the urban middle-class, who regarded both the countryside and its peasants from a hierarchical distance as well as a pleasurable condescension and even humor. It also represented a philosophical move towards a humanist view of the world as reflected by the humanist philosopher Desiderius Erasmus in his work the 'Antibarbarians', which glorified the enjoyment of a 'sancta rusticitas' (holy rusticity) in the countryside as a means to cultivate true wisdom.

He was the Principal Librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales (now State Library of New South Wales) from 1942 until 1958 and University Librarian at the University of New South Wales from 1959‚Äì1966. He was involved in the establishment and development of the Australian Institute of Librarians (AIL), the Free Library Movement and education for librarianship in Australia. Early life John Wallace Metcalfe was born on 16 May 1901 at Blackburn, Lancashire to Henry Harwood Metcalfe, a paper-bag maker, and his wife Lilian, n√©e Wilcock. The family migrated to Australia, via New Zealand, settling in Sydney in 1911. Metcalfe attended Marrickville Superior Public School and Fort Street Boys High School he later attended the University of Sydney. Metcalfe married Thelma Constance Vagg on 3 March 1934 at St Matthew's Church of England, Manly. Career Metcalfe began his career working in the New South Wales State Department of Taxation in 1917 for a few weeks before taking a position as a junior library assistant in the Fisher Library at the University of Sydney. =The Public Library of New South Wales= In 1923 Metcalfe was appointed to the Public Library of New South Wales. William Ifould, the Principal Librarian, took an interest in Metcalfe's career and mentored him. Metcalfe was promoted to the newly created position of deputy principal librarian in 1932. In November 1933 John Metcalfe presented a paper about the state of libraries in Australia to the Federal Library Conference held in Melbourne. This paper was given to Ralph Munn and Ernest Pitt who had been funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1934 to tour and inspect Australian libraries and to publish their report. In July 1934 Metcalfe was offered a travel grant of ¬£2,000 by the Carnegie Corporation which allowed him to inspect libraries in the USA and Great Britain. The report from his trip was widely circulated. Metcalfe contributed to the development of free public libraries in New South Wales, providing technical advice to the Free Library Movement (FLM), a citizens' lobby group advocating for free public libraries. As secretary for the Libraries Advisory Committee, established by the New South Wales government, Metcalfe helped to draft a bill, which became the basis for the New South Wales Library Act, 1939. In 1937 Metcalfe helped found the first local professional association of librarians, the Australian Institute of Librarians (AIL), drafting much of its constitution, and was its first honorary general secretary. He designed the AIL examinations that set the first national professional standards for librarianship in Australia. The Public Library of New South Wales provided the first formal Australian library school, commencing in 1939, Metcalfe wrote most of its textbooks. In 1942 Metcalfe succeeded William Ifould as Principal Librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales and from 1944 he was the executive member of the Library Board of New South Wales. In 1947 Metcalfe represented Australia at the second United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization general conference in Mexico City, chairing a working party on public libraries. Metcalfe opposed censorship, appearing before the Supreme Court of Queensland in a case involving 'objectionable' comics in 1955. In October 1956, Metcalfe was seconded to the University of Sydney to review its library. =University of New South Wales= On 10 November 1958 John Metcalfe was invited to accept the position of University Librarian at the University of New South Wales. His duties would involve being responsible for the organisation and management of the University's library and the establishment and supervision of courses in library training at the University. Metcalfe was also made a member of the Professorial Board. On 2 February 1959 Metcalfe commenced as the University Librarian a role he held until May 1966. He oversaw the establishment of the first library school at an Australian university which opened in 1960 and he remained Director of the School of Librarianship until his retirement in 1968. Later life Following his retirement, Metcalfe continued to write about subject indexing and information retrieval. John Metcalfe died on 7 February 1982 at Katoomba.

On January 24, 2000, a tropical disturbance developed well east of Madagascar. Despite moderate wind shear, it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore, and late on January 25, was believed to have attained tropical storm status. After turning generally southeast, Connie attained cyclone intensity on January 27\\\\. Rapid intensification ensued. Shortly after developing a well-defined eye, Connie attained peak intensity at 0000 UTC on January 28 as an intense tropical cyclone. Thereafter, Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye. After threatening Mauritius, Connie then turned southwest, passing very close to R√©union late on January 28\\\\. After briefly leveling off in intensity that evening, Connie soon became less organized, and midday on January 29, the eye became less defined. The next day, Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm. Despite forecasts of additional weakening, Connie maintained its intensity for most of January 31\\\\. However, weakening resumed on February 1 and the storm transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on February 2\\\\. Two days later, Connie merged with another low-pressure area. Despite passing well offshore Mauritius, both the airport and the port were closed due to lack of certainty in the storm's path. Connie brought several days of heavy rains and gusty winds to the island. One person was killed there and power was briefly disconnected. Overall, damage on Mauritius was minor. While passing near Reunion, Cyclone Connie brought heavy rains to the island nation. Power was knocked out to around 40,000 individuals. Roughly 100 homes were destroyed, leaving 600 people were homeless. Another 300 sought shelter. Two people were killed, but damage in Reunion was minimal. The extratropical remnants of the system later brought flooding to Mozambique, where 20,000 people were listed as homeless. Meteorological history On January 22, an area of disturbed weather developed around 10¬∞S to 15¬∞S, a prime location for tropical cyclone formation within the basin. Although the system gradually became better organized, moderate easterly wind shear prevented significant development. By January 24 this area was located approximately east of the northern tip of Madagascar. Following a significant increase in organization due to decreased wind shear, the M√©t√©o-France office in Reunion (MFR) upgraded the system into Tropical Disturbance 4\\\\. At 1100 UTC on January 25, MFR upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system. At 1800 UTC that day, the MFR upgraded the system into Moderate Tropical Storm Connie while the JTWC also upgraded Connie into a tropical storm. Situated in an environment of favorable wind shear, Connie steadily became better organized. It quickly developed rainbands and good outflow. At first, Connie was nearly stationary but on January 26, moved northeastward under the influence of a subtropical ridge. Tropical Cyclone Connie slowly strengthened, although this process was slowed due to upwelling of cold ocean waters. That morning, the JTWC upgraded Connie to a hurricane. At 0703 UTC, satellite imagery dedicated a wide eye. Despite the eye feature, MFR assessed the intensity at . Early the next day, however, MFR classified Connie as a severe tropical storm following satellite data, which suggested that Connie had developed an 80% closed eyewall. Moving east-southeast, Connie was upgraded to cyclone intensity at noon on January 27\\\\. Meanwhile, the JTWC revised the storms intensity to , equivalent to a low-end Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) roughly north-northwest of Mauritius. With an upper-level high located near the cyclone, the tropical cyclone steadily became better organized and thus Connie began to strengthen rapidly, as previously indicated by many tropical cyclone forecast models. The system then began to slowly turn southeast in the general direction of Mauritius and R√©union. By 1800 UTC on January 27, Tropical Cyclone Connie developed a very well defined eye; based on this, MFR upgraded Connie to a very intense tropical cyclone. Around this time, the JTWC raised the intensity of Connie to , equal to a borderline Category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS, based on Dvorak intensity estimates of T5.5 and T6.0. After passing around north-northwest of Mauritius, Connie then decelerated east-southeast. At 0000 UTC on January 28, MFR estimated that Connie attained its peak intensity of . Despite this cloud tops associated with Connie began to warm, even though the eye remained well-defined. Thus, the JTWC lowered the intensity of Connie to , based on a blend of satellite intensity estimates. Early on January 28, Connie made its closest approach to St. Brandon and initially appeared to be approaching Mauritius. However, many computer models correctly predicted Connie to turn southwest and threaten Reunion. Throughout the day, Connie maintained its intensity, but by the evening on January 28, thunderstorm activity diminished and the cloud structure became less organized, though the storm maintained a small eye. Increased southerly wind shear from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) took toll on the system. During the morning hours of January 29 both agencies reduced the intensity to as the storm began to encounter dry air. By the afternoon, MFR downgraded Connie to tropical cyclone status; the eye had become cloud-filled, although it was still visible on radar. That night, the storm passed northwest of Reunion. Early on January 30, MFR downgraded Connie to a severe tropical storm. Later that day, the JTWC estimated that Connie lost hurricane-force winds roughly east of the southern tip of Madagascar; all of the storm's deep convection by this time was displaced to the south. After moving away from Reunion, Connie accelerated towards the south around a subtropical ridge situated near Amsterdam Island. On January 31, Connie turned southeast, steered about a trough to the southeast. Contrary to forecasts which predicted continued weakening, MFR kept the intensity at for most of January 31\\\\. Based on satellite derived intensity estimates, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Connie to a Category 1 hurricane equivalent on the SSHWS at 1800 UTC. However, the re-strengthening trend was short lived due to increased northwesterly wind shear. Satellite imagery early on February 1 revealed an exposed circulation and a rapid decreased of thunderstorm activity in bothy coverage and intensity. Based on this and the fact that the storm appeared to be losing tropical characteristics, MFR issued its final advisory on Connie. However, the JTWC continued to track Connie until February 2, when it merged with an extratropical low. At the time of dissipation, the JTWC assessed the intensity of Connie at . Impact Despite large uncertainty in the storm's path, the international airport on the eastern side of Mauritius and all ships within the Port Louis harbor had departed. A cyclone warning was declared and 165 shelters were opened. As a precaution, power was turned off. However, on the afternoon of January 29 all sea and airports were re-opened and power was turned back on as the storm moved away. While making its closet approach to Mauritius on January 28, Connie brought heavy rains and strong winds to the archipelago. Winds greater than were recorded through much of the island, including a peak of in M√©dine. During a six-day period from January 26 to January 31, many locations along the eastern portion of the island received , equivalent to approximately a month's worth of rainfall, including a maximum rainfall of . These rains helped relieve extreme drought conditions. Offshore, waves up to in height were reported. One man perished on his roof while trying to fix his antenna. Two rivers were flooded but all in all, damage was minimal. Due to its slow motion, Intense Tropical cyclone Connie deluged Reunion with heavy rains for several days before suddenly tampering off on January 29\\\\. Throughout the passage of the cyclone, many locations recorded wind gusts in excess of , highlighted by in Le Port, in Peite France, and in Maida. Moreover, a peak rainfall total of was measured in Commerson, of which occurred in a 24‚Äëhour time frame. Many roads across Reunion were damaged. Power was knocked out to 40,000 customers while more than 100 homes were demolished. Two persons were killed, including a young man that fell while trying to observe the cyclone. A total of 600 people were reported homeless; roughly 300 people were evacuated. Although the agriculture sector suffered the most significant damages, overall, damage was minor. However, the French government later provided relief aid to Reunion as a result of the damage. The non-tropical remnants of Connie brought flooding to Southern Africa for several days. In Maputo, of rain fell within a day. Large sections of many neighborhoods were inundated. Roughly 20,000 people were rendered homeless. The road that linked Maputo to South Africa was cut. The Ministry of Education was forced to delay the start of the school year. Following the floods, roughly 20 emergency shelters were opened. These rains help set the stage for additional flooding caused by Cyclone Leon‚ÄìEline and Cyclone Hudah.

Street scene with tram in Karachi, ca. 1900. History The idea of a tramway system for Karachi was conceived and a tender for its construction was first made in 1881. On February 8, 1883 a plan for a tramway was drawn up and permission obtained from the government for the use of steam- powered trams. In October 1884 construction was started. John Brunton was the Chief Engineer of the project. The tramway was opened on April 20, 1885 employing steam-powered cars. The opening ceremony took place near St Andrew's Church (Abdullah Haroon Road and Sharah-e-Liaquat).Jang 4 April 2010 The steam trams were replaced by horse-drawn ones in 1886.The Friday Times 17 January 2014 In 1902 the East India Tramways Company Limited was responsible for running the trams in Karachi. By March 23, 1905 petrol-powered tram were introduced. By 1909 the entire fleet was replaced by petrol-powered trams, unlike Europe which had switched to electric trams.Walmar, C. A short history of trains. Dorling Kindersley, London, 2014. Each car had a capacity of 46 passengers and could travel at speeds of up to 18 mph. New tracks had to be re-laid for the petrol driven trams. The trams now ran on inverted U-shaped grooved-bridge rail with a four-foot gauge. The first two petrol-engined tramcars were designed by John Abbott and his son John Dixon Abbott, incorporating the Dixon-Abbott patent gearbox. They were built in England. By 1914, there were 37 petrol-powered tramcars running. 1945 saw the introduction of the first diesel-powered trams. Until 1955 there were still 64 petrol- powered trams in Karachi numbered from 94 to 157. These were single deck 4-wheeled cars with back-to-back cross benches. They had an 8 ft wheel base, and were 28 feet long, and 6 feet 8 inches wide. These cars were built between 1924 and 1948 with Perkins P.4 Diesel Engines and Simplex (Dixon-Abbott) Gearboxes. Cars number 145 to 157 were built as new diesel cars, while the rest of the cars were converted from petrol to diesel. In 1949 the whole tramway system was sold to the Mohamedali Tramways Company (MTC) owned by Sheikh Mohammad Ali. The tram was a common mode of transport as was the horse- drawn carriage.Viccaji, L. Made in Pakistan. Royal Book Company, Karachi, 2017. Only the elite had cars. A few young men owned motorcycles. Both men and women went about on bicycles, for this was the most common type of transport.Mascarenhas, Oswin (2011). The Origin and Evolution of St Lawrence's Parish, Karachi, Pakistan: The Garden Area with the Settlement of the Christian Community (Kindle Locations 809-811). Kindle Edition. According to the nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan who lived in Karachi at the time, the tram fare in the 1950s was one anna (less than one cent).The News May 28, 2012 Another user Ian Vaughan-Arbuckle says ‚ÄúYou could use the trams without being jostled.‚ÄùDawn, February 4, 2019 Routes The original line which started operating on April 20, 1885 ran from Saddar to Kiamari. *Between 1891-1900 the Lawrence Road (in 2014 Nishtar Road) route was constructed. *On September 30, 1911 the line was extended to Frere Street (in 2014 Dr. Daud Pota Road). *On February 17, 1916 the Soldier Bazaar route was introduced via Mansfield Street (in 2014 Syedna Burhanuddin Road).

One of the most renowned South African judges, he was passed over twice for the position of Chief Justice of South Africa for political reasons. He was later described as \\"the greatest Chief Justice South Africa never had\\".  Early life  Schreiner was born in Cape Town in 1890, the son of William Philip Schreiner, the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony during the Boer War, and his wife, Frances, a sister of President F. W. Reitz. The author Olive Schreiner was his aunt. Schreiner attended the Rondebosch Boys' High School, the South African College School (SACS), before going to the South African College (now the University of Cape Town), where he was the admired president of the Debating Union. An excellent student, he \\"could have had the Rhodes Scholarship for the asking\\", but understood, in the light of Rhodes's involvement in the Jameson Raid and subsequent fallout with William Schreiner, that \\"no Schreiner took such a gift from such a man\\". Instead, Schreiner went up to Trinity College, Cambridge to read Law. Like his father, who had also studied at Cambridge, Schreiner had a brilliant academic career, topping the list for Part I of the Law Tripos in 1912, winning the George Long Prize in Roman Law, and receiving a Trinity Senior Scholarship. In 1915 he was granted his BA in absentia and in 1916 he was elected to a fellowship of Trinity. His studies were interrupted by the First World War: he was commissioned into the British Army, and served with the Northamptonshire Regiment and the South Wales Borderers. he was wounded in the right arm at Tr√¥nes Wood during the Battle of the Somme, and received the Military Cross. After recovering from his injuries, he was sent to Mesopotamia, but his ship was torpedoed en route. He was demobilized with the rank of captain.  Legal career  After the war Schreiner completed his legal studies and was called to the English bar at the Inner Temple, completing his pupillage under Wilfred Greene and Geoffrey Lawrence. He was called to the Transvaal bar in 1920 and set up a practice in Johannesburg, dealing primarily in Commercial Arbitration, White Collar Crime and being recognised as a specialist in Procedure. He also lectured on the Law of Torts and Crime at the Faculty of Law of University College, Johannesburg (now University of the Witwatersrand), then in its early days: the Law School is today named in his honour. He had a roaring civil practice, and took silk in 1935. In the 1920s, he was approached by Jan Hofmeyr to enter politics, but declined to do so. On 15 February, he was appointed an acting judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division, and was appointed to a permanent position on the court on 1 August 1937. As a trial judge, Schreiner was said to be quiet and polite, but a sharp questioner, and looked primarily after Chamber work. During the Second World War, he presided over a special court in charge of trying cases of sabotage and hampering the war effort. He also presided over the special court which tried Robey Leibbrandt and others for high treason; the judgment ran to 70,000 words and took seven hours to be delivered. On 1 January 1945 he was promoted to the Appellate Division, where he served until his retirement in 1960. Initially he heard primarily Civil Appeals from trial courts as well as Tax Appeals, but later on exclusively heard Second Appeals as well as Petitions against the Executive During the Coloured Vote Crisis Schreiner steadfastly refused to endorse the attempts of the Nationalist government to remove Coloured voters from the Cape Province's roll. Finally, after the Appellate Division had been packed with pliant judges, it approved the government's reconstitution of the Senate. Schreiner was the lone dissentient. = Passed over for the Chief Justiceship = Schreiner was twice passed over for appointment as Chief Justice, despite being the most senior appellate judge (tradition dictated that the appointment should go to the most senior appellate judge). On the first occasion he was superseded by Henry Allan Fagan, who accepted the appointment with reluctance; although it was obvious to both that Schreiner was being punished by the government for his role in the coloured vote crisis. Initially the judges of the Court had, at the suggestion of outgoing Chief Justice Albert van der Sandt Centlivres, tried to reach an agreement that they would all refuse appointment, so that the government would be forced to appoint Schreiner. But this plan failed when notorious National Party favourite L. C. Steyn failed to agree. Fagan therefore accepted the Chief Justiceship with misgivings, after consulting with Schreiner, so that Steyn would not be appointed. When Fagan retired two years later, Schreiner was again passed over, this time losing out to Steyn. Schreiner was later described by Ellison Kahn as \\"the greatest Chief Justice South Africa never had\\". Politically, Ellison Kahn classifies Schreiner as a traditional Cape liberal: he opposed racism, and in old age refused to sit on whites-only bus seats. In 1970 he refused to be renominated as President of the Cripple Care Association of the Transvaal because its constitution had been amended to restrict membership to whites only.  Honours and awards  After his retirement he served on the Wits Council and as president of the South African Institute of Race Relations. A long-serving member of the Council of the University of the Witwatersrand, he was elected unopposed as Chancellor of the university, serving from 1962 to 1974. He also sat on the appellate courts of various African territories. He was awarded three honorary doctorates: from the University of Cape Town (1958), Witwatersrand (1961) and Rhodes (1963). In 1967 he delivered the Hamlyn Lectures at Cambridge.

Beginning in the 17th century, Vienna became an important cultural center for Hungarians. During the time of the Austro- Hungarian Empire (1867-1918) and the early 1990s, Hungarians were the second largest non-German speaking population in Vienna after the Czechs. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, many of the Viennese Hungarians returned to Hungary. Today, Vienna is home to a small Hungarian population of around 27,000. History The Hungarian College Hungarians established a community in Vienna (Hungarian B√©cs) from 1541 following the 1526 battle of Moh√°cs. Towards the end of the 17th century the city became a key cultural center for Hungarians. Hungarian students graduated from the Vienna University and from the 17th century onwards there was an increasing influx of Hungarian craftsmen into Vienna. The first cultural associations were set up in Vienna in the 1860s. 130,300 residents of Vienna in 1910 were citizens of the Hungarian part of the empire, while only 45,000 of them were also ethnically Hungarians. After World War I a re-emigration started. In censuses of the Interwar period Hungarians counted between 1000-2000 people.C. Paulston, D. Peckham. Linguistic Minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, p. 21 After World War II The population sharply decreased again, as the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Hungarian or Czech origin to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet Bloc economy. However, refugees from Hungary increased the numbers again in 1945, 1948 and 1956. In the 2010s, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a number of Hungarian Jews have left Hungary due to antisemitism and economic woes and resettled in Vienna. The Viennese Jewish community has encouraged Hungarian Jews from Budapest to resettle in Vienna due to fears over the rise of the far-right Jobbik party, a climate of nationalism and xenophobia, and an economic recession. Disagreement exists within Jewish communities in Austria and Hungary over the extent to which Hungarian-Jewish emigration from Hungary is due to economic problems or due to antisemitism. As of 2017, Vienna was home to almost 27,000 Hungarians. See also *Hungarians in Austria References Further reading * Fleischer, Gyula.

After Romania left the Axis Powers and joined the Allies during World War II, between 5 September and 10 October 1944, SƒÉrma»ôu came under the occupation of the Nazi-aligned Hungarian troops. During this period, Hungarian gendarmes and members of the Hungarian National Guard, led by captain of gendarmes L√°nczos L√°szl√≥, killed 126 local Jews, as well as 39 Romanians, the latter primarily prisoners of war captured in the battles on the alignment of Oarba de Mure»ô‚ÄìLudu»ô‚ÄìGheja‚ÄìChe»õani.  The massacre  Cemetery of Jews killed by Horthysts in SƒÉrma»ôu Hungarian population in the area, who supported the cause of Hungary, in the desire to regain the whole of Transylvania, started, along with the Hungarian Guard, to loot houses of Jews and Romanians. On 9 September 1944, a team of Hungarian gendarmes took up from their homes several Romanians that had important functions in the administration of the commune. These people were taken to an improvised camp in SƒÉrma»ôu and were tortured for several days. According to the sentence handed down on 28 June 1946 by the People's Tribunal in Cluj, \\"in the camp was applied an inhumane treatment, consisting of beatings, ill-treatments and executions staged at night. For example, once all Romanians were removed from the camp in the yard, put on their knees (¬´At the church¬ª), and, after this exercise, everyone, regardless of age, was forced to overturn until exhaustion\\". In the afternoon of 16 September, those 126 Jews in the improvised camp were transported with carriages to a place called Suscut, and in the night of 16/17 September were killed by Hungarian gendarmes and soldiers. The bodies of those killed (31 adult males, 52 adult females and 43 children up to age 15) were exhumed from two mass graves in February 1945. The conclusion reached by the Medico-legal commission who conducted the autopsy of the cadavers was violent death by shooting, and, in the case of several children, violent death by asphyxiation, those ones being buried alive. On 15 September 1944, some Romanians were released, and 18 others were deported to Hungary. They were taken by truck to Cluj, where they were rounded up and forced to march, escorted by civilian police, on the way to Jibou and then to Budapest. One of the deported and declared dead was Iuliu Moldovan, father of actor Ovidiu Iuliu Moldovan. Likewise, father Micu, a priest almost 80 years old, was killed. The number of all Romanians deported who lost their lives is not known exactly.  Sentence of People's Tribunal in Cluj  Investigations against those responsible for the massacres of SƒÉrma»ôu and Ludu»ô started in 1945 and ended in 1946. By sentence of the Cluj Tribunal was established the responsibility for the SƒÉrma»ôu massacre: two officers of the gendarmerie troops (captain L√°ncz L√°szl√≥, lieutenant Vecsey) and five NCOs (second lieutenant Halasz, second lieutenant Fekete, sergeant major Szabo, sergeant Horv√°th Istv√°n and sergeant Polg√°r) were found guilty and were sentenced to death.

Kannan as Financier * Chadru as Saleem * \\"Anbaana\\" Arun as Bhaskar * Prem Kumar as Pazhani * L. Raja as Roshini's father Production In 2011, Abbas Akbar approached director Venkat Prabhu with the script of the film, hoping that the director would work on the project as an executive producer. Akbar held initial talks with Dinesh to play the lead role, but Prabhu's decision not to produce the film meant that Dinesh also opted against working on the project. Akbar later approached actor R. Madhavan and narrated the script of the film to him, but the actor was busy with the production of Irudhi Suttru (2016) and was not interested in immediately beginning the project. Abbas Akbar secured a fund from the Media Development Authority in Singapore to make the film, while he also sold his house to raise funds. The first schedule began in Chennai and was completed by September 2014. The second schedule of the film began in October 2014 in Singapore and featured a combination of cast members from India and Singapore. Sathya and Hebah Patel began working on the film but the project soon ran into trouble after the film was half complete. The director and Sathya had creative differences after Sathya had refused to attend rehearsals and was subsequently removed from the film. The film was subsequently started with newcomers throughout 2015 and successfully finished by 2016. Soundtrack Music composer, Mohamaad Ghibran announced on his social media pages that the audio launch will be done through a uniquely designed Audio Drive. Ghibran and director Abbas Akbar planned to undertake the cross-country trip from Chennai to Singapore, where each song number was released on YouTube at each border, from Chennai to Singapore, crossing Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia! Engaging his fans and friends through his social media pages, Ghibran asked for advice about the road trip. He also sent a wish for Ajith Kumar, known for his road skills, to offer his advice. The historic Audio Drive flag-off event in August 2016 at Sathyam Theatres Chennai was graced by popular Kollywood actor Suriya. The event garnered an outstanding media presence and wide publicity for the film and its prolific efforts to release each single. The first song that was released in Chennai, ‚ÄúVaadi Vaadi‚Äù topped the charts on the popular radio station, Radio Mirchi, for over a week in August 2016, and went on to top the weekly charts on other stations such as Big FM, Radio City, and Suryan FM. The vibrant song also took the top spot for overall airplay across Chennai‚Äôs FMs in September 2016. The complete soundtrack of Chennai 2 Singapore claimed an impressive 1st spot on iTunes All India Music Store due to its snazzy city-styled numbers and Apple Music chose ‚ÄúVaadi Vaadi‚Äù as its best song of the week in September 2016. The first four songs appear in the film, while the next three don't. Reception The film released to good audience reviews particularly with the younger audience.

It is located along the Caltanissetta- Gela motorway. The company operates both nationally and internationally in a variety of fields including oil, gas, defense, aerospace, offshore production, and research. History Meccanotecnica Riesi was first started in a garage by founder Rocco Lo Stimolo in 1992. In 1999 the company expanded and purchased its current headquarters on the outskirts of Riesi in order to meet its growing customer demand. Initially created to address the technical and machine part replacement needs of nearby petrochemical companies, Meccanotecnica Riesi began to expand into other technological fields in 2000. MR-XPM began to diversify with substantial investment in machinery in order meet a more varied range of industry needs and expand their services. Shortly after this change MR-XPM began working with a number of companies abroad, most notably firms in Norway and the United States. Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Meccanotecnica Riesi participated in three international trade exhibitions: MEC SPE in Parma (2004), the Arab Oil & Gas show in Dubai (2005), and the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston (2006). A representative of MR-XPM was invited to speak about fostering international partnerships between companies for the Financial Times Manufacturing for the Future Conference in 2008. A year later MR-XPM became an AgustaWestland approved vendor. Projects After expanding their business in 2000, MR-XPM first worked with the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malarg√ºe, Argentina by creating paraboloids specifically for tracking high energy particles. In 2010 Meccanotecnica was selected to contribute to the Large Hadron Collider project in Geneva, Switzerland. Since then, MR-XPM has been involved with projects for the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, among other research institutes. Management Rocco Lo Stimolo is the founder and current General Manager of Meccanotecnica Riesi s.r.l. His sons, Giovanni and Angelo, also hold positions at the company as a Production Manager and Director of Finance, respectively.

Meanwhile, Rosy Trovato, Rocco's daughter-in-law, is MR-XPM's Manager of International Business Development. University Partnerships Meccanotecnica Riesi has also collaborated with a number of universities. In 2010 Northeastern University partnered with MR-XPM to include them in their international cooperative education program, where students from the school have the opportunity to live abroad and work at the company for a span of six months. The following year they partnered with both Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. MR-XPM's work with MIT included building a special wheel prototype while their work with Embry Riddle focused on creating a cryogenic liquid rocket. In addition to an already existing internship and research partnership, Babson College worked with Meccanotecnica in 2013 for their JMCFE project.http://giornaleonline.lasicilia.it/GiornaleOnLine/stampa_articolo.php?id_articolo=2487352&pagina;=29 Nuova Meccanica s.r.l.

The Awards were established by journalist and legal editor Craig Sisterson in 2010, and are named after Dame Ngaio Marsh, one of the four Queens of Crime of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. The Award is presented at the WORD Christchurch Writers & Readers Festival in Christchurch, the hometown of Dame Ngaio.  Beginnings  The Ngaio Marsh Award for Best Crime Novel was launched in 2010 by lawyer turned journalist Craig Sisterson, who wanted to create an opportunity for great New Zealand crime, mystery, and thriller writing to be recognised and celebrated. Local crime writers were often overlooked by festival organisers and books awards in New Zealand, despite international acclaim, and up until that point New Zealand, unlike most other English- speaking countries, did not have a specific award for crime, mystery, and thriller fiction. Sisterson had been writing reviews and features about crime writers for a number of magazines and newspapers in New Zealand and Australia and had set up a website about New Zealand crime writing. Earlier in 2010, he had written an opinion piece, \\"Kiwis love crime fiction, but what about our own?\\" for Booknotes magazine saying that New Zealand had great crime writers who were not being supported locally, by bookstores, literary festivals, or awards, and it was time that changed. After discussions with many people in the New Zealand book industry, Sisterson decided to launch the Ngaio Marsh Award at the Christchurch Writers Festival in 2010, honouring both contemporary crime writers and New Zealand's most famous mystery writer in her own hometown. He sought and received the blessing of Dame Ngaio Marsh's closest living relative to honour Dame Ngaio by using her name and an artistic impression of her likeness for New Zealand's first-ever crime fiction prize. The inaugural award was intended to be presented at the biennial Christchurch Writers Festival in September 2010, but had to be postponed due to a severe earthquake that struck the city that month, leading to the cancellation of the festival. The first Ngaio Marsh Award was presented at a special event in Christchurch in December 2010, and won by the pseudonymous author Alix Bosco for the thriller Cut & Run. Bosco did not attend the presentation ceremony, but would later reveal 'herself' as New Zealand screenwriter and playwright Greg McGee in the lead-up to the 2011 Award. The launch of the Award, and New Zealand crime writing in general, was featured in major newspapers and magazines in New Zealand, including the Sunday Star-Times, the Herald on Sunday, and the New Zealand Listener. Neil Cross winning the 2012 Ngaio Marsh Award  The Award  For the first three years of the Award, the winner received a distinctive handcrafted trophy designed and created by New Zealand sculptor and Unitec art lecturer Gina Ferguson, a full set of Ngaio Marsh novels, and a cash prize provided by the Christchurch Writers Festival Trust. The trophy depicted an artistic rendering of Dame Ngaio's famous visage in mother-of-pearl on a black velvet covered partially open book. From 2013, the winners have received a framed plaque bearing the award logo, a selection of Ngaio Marsh novels, and a cash prize. In 2016, a second category was added for debut crime novels, the Ngaio Marsh Award for Best First Novel, and in 2017 a new award for true crime and other non fiction writing was added, the Ngaio Marsh Award for Best Non Fiction.  Award presentations  Following the postponement of the inaugural event when the biennial Christchurch Writers Festival was cancelled in 2010, the Award has been presented at a variety of events in association with the Christchurch Writers Festival, which has continued its support of the Award, each year. In 2011, the \\"Setting the Stage for Murder\\" event was held at the Christchurch Arts Festival, with all four finalists and internationally bestselling crime writers Tess Gerritsen and John Hart in attendance. In 2012, 2014, and 2016 the Ngaios were presented at events as part of the Christchurch Writers Festival programme, in each case following the popular 'Great New Zealand Crime Debate'. In 2012 Australian crime writer Michael Robotham presented the Award, and in 2014 Icelandic crime writer Yrsa Sigurdardottir presented the Award. Sigurdardottir became a judge of the Ngaios from 2015.  Winners and finalists  = 2010 = The inaugural presentation was made in Christchurch after a standalone crime panel featuring two of the three finalists, Neil Cross and Vanda Symon, local crime writer Paul Cleave, and chaired by Sisterson.

Logo The label includes a green flower with inclined green \\"œµ\\" (Greek epsilon) as the flower, surrounded by 12 blue stars. On EU Ecolabelled products, it must always be used together with the license number. Because of the logo, the label has a nickname EU Flower.  Governance  The implementation of the EU Ecolabel is set through Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Its management is carried out by the European Commission and the national competent bodies. There is a competent body in each European Economic Area member state. The EU Ecolabel is part of a broader EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy adopted by the European Commission on 16 July 2008, which also links the EU Ecolabel to other EU policies such as green public procurement (GPP) and Ecodesign of energy-using products. Criteria EU Ecolabel meets the ISO 14020 Type I requirements for ecolabels. The EU Ecolabel criteria are developed and reviewed in cooperation of experts, industry, consumer organisations and environmental NGOs. EU Ecolabel criteria have been formulated for more than 30 non-food and non-medical product groups that are reviewed every 3‚Äì5 years. The label applications and licenses are managed by the national competent bodies. In addition, the European Commission confirmed that EU Ecolabel criteria have been changed with a new set of ecological criteria for computers (personal, notebook and tablet computers), furniture and footwear, in order to promote the Europe‚Äôs transition to a circular economy, supporting the sustainable production and consumption in the region.  Position in the market  In March 2016, there were 36,395 products that were awarded EU Ecolabel. The countries with most EU Ecolabel licences were France (26%), Italy (18%), and Germany (12%). EU Ecolabel has a strong position in most of the European countries and other ecolabelling schemes are triggered to take a position concerning the overlap with EU Ecolabel, for example Nordic ecolabel that in the Nordic countries is more popular than EU Ecolabel. In Germany, the Blue Angel is very common. In a 2013 survey, Denmark was shown to be the top country in Europe where consumers recognise the EU Ecolabel and know what it stands for, with 35% of consumers recognising it visually and 17% of consumers knowing its meaning.  Response and criticism  In early 1990s, the US, Canada and several other countries criticized the EU Ecolabel's product life-cycle analysis scheme, extra emphasis on usage of recycled materials by the products, and lack of transparency. EU Ecolabel had responded by adjustment of its assessment standards in 1996. Some decisions by EU Ecolabel, such as ban on imports of seal skins, furs caught using leg-hold traps, and Malaysian food, were criticized for their supportive nature of local European industry and allegedly unfairly putting foreign product makers at disadvantage. Similar trade barrier concerns were raised by US package goods industry in 1996. The most recent revision of the label entered in force in February 2010. Some of the goals were to provide for a more rapid criteria development for specific product categories, to harmonise the EU Ecolabel with other ecolabels and to minimize the costs of the process, as well as to simplify the application procedure. The European NGOs and consumer organizations see the EU Ecolabel as \\"a powerful instrument in encouraging environmental improvements in industry and in helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions\\".

According to Klaus Dierks, Martin Luther High was opened in 1968 at the initiative of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of South West Africa. Originally planned for the nearby town of Karibib, the South African administration did not approve the establishment of a school for black children in the white-only town. Instead, a place had to be found where white teachers and black pupils could live segregated, and the school was opened in Okombahe at the edge of the Damaraland bantustan. According to the national newspaper The Namibian, the school was established in 1962 in Karibib and moved to Okombahe in 1970, again for the reason that the school admitted black learners, and Karibib was a white-only town. The school's medium of instruction during the years of South African occupation was English, while other government schools taught in Afrikaans.

The tanks hold the record for the longest reverberation in any man-made structure, surpassing the Hamilton Mausoleum in 2014. History The secret site was officially called \\"Inchindown, Royal Navy Fuel Tanks\\" and also known as the \\"Invergordon Oil Fuel Depot\\". The complex consists of six tanks: five were long, wide, with arched roofs high; a smaller sixth tank was of the same height and breadth but shorter. Work on the tanks began in 1938 and was completed in 1941. They were built to be a bomb-proof supply of Furnace Fuel Oil to the Royal Navy's base at Invergordon. In 2014, the tanks were designated as a Category A listed building. Reverberation record In 2009, guided tours of the tanks were offered by Forestry Commission Scotland. After the tours were mentioned on BBC television programme The One Show, professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford Trevor Cox was motivated to perform reverberation tests in the underground tanks. In 2014 Allan Kilpatrick from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland fired a pistol blank inside one of the tanks. The sound was recorded by Cox, and is reported to have reverberated for 112 seconds at 125 hertz, 30 seconds at mid frequency, and 75 seconds broadband.Cox, Trevor. The Sound Book. W.W. Norton & Company, 2014, p. 57.  One Shot: Inchindown documentary  In February, 2019, photographers Simon Riddell and David Allen recorded a feature-length documentary inside the Inchindown oil facility. This documentary contains the only comprehensive tour of the facility. As part of the documentary, the photographers used a large format camera to make one negative of the first tank. They, then, slept overnight in tunnel 2; which they turned into a darkroom the next day. They continued to create a darkroom print of their negative on location without leaving the underground facility. The film won 'best documentary with the UK Monthly Film Festival.

Mythology  Psamathe was pursued and assaulted by King Aeacus of Agina. She bore him a child named Phocus (\\"Seal\\") or Linus. In one version (Conon), Psamathe abandoned the child, and although shepherds reared the foundling who was then named Linus, the child was torn apart by the shepherd's dogs. In the interim, Psamathe was ordered to be killed by her father. Apollo avenged her murder by sending a plague to Argos. When consulted, Apollo demanded that Psamathe and Linus be propitiated with due honors and festivities. The Argives complied but the plague persisted. And by oracular decree, the king was forced to leave in order to found the city of Tripodiscium near Megara, where he would live out his life.Conon, Narrationes, 19, paraphrased in In an alternate version (Pausanias), Psamathe exposed the unnamed child, which was torn apart by the king's sheepdogs. Apollo then sent Poena (Greek: Poinƒì), the personification of punishment, upon the city. Poine would steal children from their mothers until Coroebus killed her. A hero Coroebus emerged from Argos to slay it, but Apollo then brought a plague upon the city. Pausanias, translated by Jones, W.H.S.; Ormerod, H.A., ', 1. 43. 7 - 8 A version by Statius tells this story, but does not name Psamathe, whom he only records as Crotopos's daughter.Psamathe is sometimes said to be the daughter of Nereus and Doris. =Monster= The monster is called also Poine, the personification of punishment, in Pausanias's version of the tale. It is a female monster with a snake protruding from her forehead in Statius's version, possibly having snake-feet (anguipedal form) as well. The monster is also called a Kƒìr ( \\"death-demon\\") in one poem, and a late source (9th to 11th century) labels her as one of the Lamiai.First Vatican Mythographer, c. 9th to 11th century, cited by It is also supposed to have a human head upon a serpent's body, according to a scholiast to Ovid. The poem indicates that the ker was entombed in the city of the tripod (Tripodiscium) to stand as a monument to commemorate Psamathe, and that its slayer Coroebus is interred right underneath the monster. =Coroebus, the Argive= Coroebus of Argos slew Poine, in Pausanias's version. Thereupon Apollo struck the city with a plague. Coroebus decided to go to Delphi to ask for punishment to befall only him, so that the city didn't have to suffer. The Pythia told him to never return home, but to take up a tripod and carry it until he would drop it, then settle on the spot where it would happen. The tripod slipped out of his hands as he had reached the Geraneian Mountains, where he founded a town known as Tripodiskoi (\\"Little Tripods\\"). The tomb of Coroebus was shown in Megara. The hero named Coroebus does not appear in the version according to Conon.

The Institute is based in Tees Valley in the northeast of England.  Background  The British Iron and Steel Research Association (BISRA), was formed in 1944 with headquarters in London, originally at 11 Park Lane, later moved to 24 Buckingham Gate. Satellite laboratories were formed much later to support the larger UK steel producing centres of Sheffield, Swansea, Teesside, and Battersea. Following the second nationalisation of the UK Steel industry in 1967, BISRA became the R&D; function of the newly formed British Steel Corporation. Teesside Laboratories, later rebranded as Teesside Technology Centre, survived several rounds of R&D; restructuring in which laboratories in Battersea and Swansea were ultimately closed. In 2001, following the merger of British Steel with Koninklijke Hoogovens in 1999, forming Corus Group PLC, Teeside Technology Centre, Welsh Laboratories and Swinden Technology Centre were to close to form a centralised UK Technology Centre. This was to mirror the single Dutch R&D; site in IJmuiden. This centralisation attempt was backtracked but resulted in the closure of Welsh Laboratories and significant losses in numbers, knowledge and experience from both remaining centres. In 2007, Tata Steel secured 100% of the Corus Group PLC shares, taking the company off the financial market. In 2014, Tata Steel, already in the process of restructuring the UK arm of the European business, decided to also restructure UK R&D.; Teesside Technology Centre and Swinden Technology Centre were to close with a new R&D; Division being formed at Warwick Manufacturing Group. To avoid closure of the Teesside Laboratories and loss of the remaining technical process expertise in Coal & Coke, Oxygen Steelmaking, Continuous Casting and Long Products Rolling, members of the sites management team (Chris McDonald, Gareth Fletcher and Dr. Richard Curry) and the Tata Steel Process R&D; Director (Dr. Simon Pike) were permitted to spin the site out as an independent research institute. The Materials Processing Institute was launched December 2014.  Present day  The Materials Processing Institute works with steel organisations from across the UK, including Tata Steel, Liberty House Group and British Steel, while welcoming delegations from global, industry partners such as voestalpine AG, thyssenkrupp, ArcelorMittal and Sidenor. The SME Technology Centre collaborates with NEPIC and Teesside University to support SMEs operating in Tees Valley and the wider North East region, through the Innovate Tees Valley and Tees Valley Business Start Up programmes, which are part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). In 2016, the Institute launched a commercial steel-making operation from its Normanton Steel plant, which has the capabilities to produce high carbon, high chrome steels. In 2017, Liberty House Group won regional funding to develop a process to manufacture powder feedstock for additive manufacturing processes. Liberty chose to house the plant within the Materials Processing Institute. The Materials Processing Institute is a member of UK Steel and was ratified, in October 2017, as an affiliated member of the World Steel Association, the international trade body for the iron and steel industry. In 2018, intellectual property firm Marks & Clerk joined several other small firms in renting office space at the Institute's site. The move and new office was officially launched by Redcar MP Anna Turley.  Services  The Materials Processing Institute consults in the fields of sourcing and blending, blast furnace processes, continuous caster tuning and physical modelling (water-based fluid scale modelling) of caster moulds. They have ventured into contemporary techniques such as computational fluid dynamics and process instrumentation but cutbacks in staff and investment have limited development in these areas. The site hosts a c1960's manual control electric arc furnace and vacuum ladle arc furnace plus a mothballed single mould billet caster with mould section donated from the 1970s Stocksbridge vertical caster in early 2000s. The 7t arc plant is often used to melt and sandcast waste turnings from local industries at low cost and quick turnaround. The plant has limited gas extraction facilities and can only process material with low volatile content and low poisonous metals etc. The Materials Processing Institute houses Liberty Speciality Steel's Additive Manufacturing Steelmaking Powder Metallurgy Development Plant.

The colors are artifacts of displaying hi-res pixels which are half the size of the NTSC color clock. Screenshot of the game Mystery House running on an Apple II. The color white was represented by combining green and purple, which produced white in the middle, but bleeding of the other two colors on the edges Example of artwork created with the intent of having individual pixel values horizontally averaged over composite video Composite artifact colors is a designation commonly used to address several graphic modes of some 1970s and 1980s home computers. With some machines, when connected to an NTSC TV or monitor over composite video outputs, the video signal encoding allowed for extra colors to be displayed, by manipulating the pixel position on screen, not being limited by each machine's hardware color palette (though, on modern TVs it might not work as well). This mode was used mainly for games, since it limited the display's horizontal resolution more than normal. It was mostly used on the IBM PC (with CGA graphics), TRS-80 Color Computer and Apple II computers, but also possible on Atari 8-bit. The limitations of composite video regarding horizontal resolution were also exploited on other systems. Adjacent pixel values got averaged horizontally, producing solid colors or generating transparency effects. On PAL displays (or NTSC 4.43 ones) this effect doesn't generate new colors, but rather a mix of adjacent horizontal pixel values. However, depending on the PAL system used, results will vary. If PAL M or PAL N are used color artifacts seen on NTSC might also be possible. If a higher resolution video connection is used, the graphics are displayed as dither patterns. Machines such as the ZX Spectrum or Mega Drive took advantage of this situation. Hardware support =CGA= When using IBM's Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) with NTSC TV-out the separation between luminance and chrominance is imperfect, yielding cross-color artifacts. This is especially a problem with 80-column text. It is for this reason that each of the text and graphics modes described above exists twice: Once as the normal \\"color\\" version and once as a \\"monochrome\\" version. The \\"monochrome\\" version of each mode turns off the NTSC color decoding in the viewing monitor completely, resulting in a black-and-white picture, but also no color bleeding, hence, a sharper picture. On RGBI monitors, the two versions of each mode are identical, with the exception of the 320√ó200 graphics mode, where the \\"monochrome\\" version produces the third palette. However, programmers learned that this flaw could be turned into an asset, as distinct patterns of high- resolution dots would turn into consistent areas of solid colors, thus allowing the display of completely new colors. Since these new colors are the result of cross-color artifacting, they are often called \\"artifact colors\\". Both the standard 320√ó200 four-color and the 640√ó200 color-on-black graphics modes could be used with this technique. The resulting screens would have a usable resolution of 160√ó200 with 16 colors: *Black *Dark green *Blue *Cyan *Crimson *Dark brownish grey *Magenta *Violet *Dark grey *Bright Green *Light brownish grey *Bright Cyan *Scarlet *Yellow *Hot Pink *White =TRS-80 Color Computer= The TRS-80 Color Computer 256√ó192 two color graphics mode uses four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system. It is not possible to reliably display 256 dots across the screen due to the limitations of the NTSC signal and the phase relationship between the VDG clock and colorburst frequency. In the first colorset, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black are not distinct and appear as a muddy green color. However, when one switches to the white and black colorset, instead of a muddy gray as expected, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots will give the opposite color. In effect this mode becomes a 128√ó192 4 color graphics mode where black, orange, blue, and white are available (the Apple II created color graphics by exploiting a similar effect). Most CoCo games used this mode as the colors available are more useful than the ones provided in the hardware 4 color modes. The VDG internally can power up on either the rising or falling edge of the clock, so the bit patterns that represent orange and blue are not predictable. Most CoCo games start with a title screen and asks the user to press the reset button until the colors are correct. The CoCo 3 fixes the clock-edge problem so it is always the same; a user holds the F1 key during reset to choose the other color set. On a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact; to see them one uses a TV or composite monitor, or patch the games to use the hardware 128√ó192 four color mode in which the GIME chip allows the color choices to be mapped. Users in PAL countries see green and purple stripes instead of solid red and blue colors. Readers of The Rainbow or Hot CoCo magazine learned that they can use some POKE commands to switch the 6847 VDG into one of the artifact modes, while Extended Color Basic continues to operate as though it were still displaying one of the 128x192 four-color modes. Thus, the entire set of Extended Color Basic graphics commands can be used with the artifact colors. Some users developed a set of 16 artifact colors using a 4√ó2 pixel matrix. Use of POKE commands also make these colors available to the graphics commands, although the colors have to be drawn one horizontal line at a time. Some interesting artworks were produced from these effects, especially since the CoCo Max art package provides them in its palette of colors. The resulting 16 color palette is: *black *dark cyan *brick red *light violet *dark blue *azure *olive green *brown *purple *light blue *orange *yellow *light gray *blue- white *pink-white *white =Apple II= Color graphics on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the NTSC television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The Apple II display provides two pixels per NTSC subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replaces the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode uses the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both. =Atari 8-bit= The graphics 8 mode on Atari 8-bit computers using the Color Television Interface Adaptor (CTIA) chip is designed to display black or white at a resolution of 320√ó192. Programmers found that by using artifact colors blue and red can also be used in the mode, and software such as On-Line Systems' The Wizard and the Princess use the feature to display four colors. After Atari began shipping computers with the improved Graphic Television Interface Adaptor (GTIA) users found that such programs displayed incorrect colors and needed updates. Software support Many of the more high-profile game titles offers graphics optimized for composite color monitors. Ultima II, the first game in the game series to be ported to IBM PC, uses CGA composite graphics. King's Quest I was also innovative in its use of 16-color graphics. Other titles include Microsoft Decathlon, King's Quest II and King's Quest III. Other machines and the PAL system Using a composite connection with the PAL TV system will not generate new colors, but instead a horizontal blurring effect. Given the different bandwidths of the PAL broadcast systems (PAL-M, PAL-N, PAL-B, etc..), the actual effect intensity will vary. This effect will be more pronounced if higher display resolutions are used, and as such was exploited by game artists on some machines using dithering patterns. One notable example of this is the Mega Drive, which takes full advantage of it to simulate transparency effects. Other home computers like the Atari ST or the Commodore Amiga also have graphics prepared with dithering techniques to take advantage of composite TV connections. Regarding the Amiga, the special Hold-And-Modify is particularly suited for displaying \\"high color\\" TV-like images, taking full advantage of horizontal blurring.

It is a CMOS-based switch, in which PMOS passes a strong 1 but poor 0, and NMOS passes strong 0 but poor 1. Both PMOS and NMOS work simultaneously.  Structure  Principle diagram of a transmission gate. The control input ST must be able to take to control depending on the supply voltage and switching voltage different logic levels. In principle, a transmission gate is made up of two field-effect transistors, in which ‚Äì in contrast to traditional discrete field-effect transistors ‚Äì the substrate terminal (bulk) is not connected internally to the source terminal. The two transistors, an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET, are connected in parallel with this, however, only the drain and source terminals of the two transistors are connected together. Their gate terminals are connected to each other by a NOT gate (inverter), to form the control terminal. Two variants of the \\"bow tie\\" symbol commonly used to represent a transmission gate in circuit diagrams Unlike with discrete FETs, the substrate terminal is not connected to the source connection. Instead, the substrate terminals are connected to the respective supply potential in order to ensure that the parasitic substrate diode (between source/drain and substrate) is always reversely biased and so does not affect signal flow. The substrate terminal of the p-channel MOSFET is thus connected to the positive supply potential, and the substrate terminal of the n-channel MOSFET connected to the negative supply potential.  Function  Resistance characteristic of a transmission gate. VTHN and VTHP denote those positions at which the voltage to be switched has reached a potential, where the threshold voltage of the respective transistor is reached. When the control input is a logic zero (negative power supply potential), the gate of the n-channel MOSFET is also at a negative supply voltage potential. The gate terminal of the p-channel MOSFET is caused by the inverter, to the positive supply voltage potential. Regardless of on which switching terminal of the transmission gate (A or B) a voltage is applied (within the permissible range), the gate-source voltage of the n-channel MOSFETs is always negative, and the p-channel MOSFETs is always positive. Accordingly, neither of the two transistors will conduct and the transmission gate turns off. When the control input is a logic one, the gate terminal of the n-channel MOSFETs is located at a positive supply voltage potential. By the inverter, the gate terminal of the p-channel MOSFETs is now at a negative supply voltage potential. As the substrate terminal of the transistors is not connected to the source terminal, the drain and source terminals are almost equal and the transistors start conducting at a voltage difference between the gate terminal and one of these conducts. One of the switching terminals of the transmission gate is raised to a voltage near the negative supply voltage, a positive gate-source voltage (gate-to-drain voltage) will occur at the N-channel MOSFET, and the transistor begins to conduct, and the transmission gate conducts. The voltage at one of the switching terminals of the transmission gate is now raised continuously up to the positive supply voltage potential, so the gate-source voltage is reduced (gate-drain voltage) on the n-channel MOSFET, and this begins to turn off. At the same time, the p-channel MOSFET has a negative gate-source voltage (gate-to-drain voltage) builds up, whereby this transistor starts to conduct and the transmission gate switches. Thereby it is achieved that the transmission gate passes over the entire voltage range. The transition resistance of the transmission gate varies depending upon the voltage to be switched, and corresponds to a superposition of the resistance curves of the two transistors.  Applications  = Electronic switch = Transmission gates are used in order to implement electronic switches and analog multiplexers. If a signal is connected to different outputs (changeover switches, multiplexers), multiple transmission gates can be used as a transmission gate to either conduct or block (simple switch). A typical example is known as the 4066 4-way analog switch which is available from various manufacturers.4066 Datenbl√§tter = Analog multiplexer = Many mixed- signal systems use an analog multiplexer to route several analog input channels to a single analog-to-digital converter. Franco Zappa. \\"Electronic Systems\\". Section 6.9: Analog Multiplexers. John G. Webster. \\"Electrical Measurement, Signal Processing, and Displays\\". 2003\\\\. p. 36-12. Robert A. Pease. \\"Troubleshooting Analog Circuits\\". 2013\\\\. p. 132. = Logic circuits = Logic circuits can be constructed with the aid of transmission gates instead of traditional CMOS pull-up and pull-down networks. Such circuits can often be made more compact, which can be an important consideration in silicon implementations. = Negative voltages = By using a transmission gate to switch alternating voltages (e.g.: audio signal), the negative power supply potential must be lower than the lowest signal potential. This ensures that the substrate diode will remain non-conducting even at negative voltages. Although the transmission gate can still switch to logic voltage levels, there are special versions with integrated level shifters. A good example, is the 4053 standard chip, commonly used to select between analogue inputs to an audio amplifier, has a separate ground (pin 8) and negative substrate connection (pin 7) that also supplies the level shifter.

The youngest of the judges, Mr. Sleem, a well-known lawyer from Lahore, sat to the left of the President. He looked smart and vivacious. ‚Ä¶ His smiling self-confident attitude put in unfavourable contrast the bearing of the third and the oldest of the judges, Rai Bahadur Ganga Ram Soni.

Varma based on the true story of Manjunath Shanmugam ‚Äî the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow graduate who was killed in Lakhimpur, U.P., in November 2005, for his stand against corruption and fuel adulteration. Plot In the hinterland of Uttar Pradesh 27-year-old Manjunath Shanmugam is a student at the state-of-the-art campus of the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM-L). After graduating, Manjunath joins a petroleum company as a sales officer. He is posted in Lakhimpur Kheri, a remote district in rural Uttar Pradesh. One day Manjunath goes missing. His friends panic, because they know that of late he had been very disturbed and was behaving strangely. He had become serious and scared. He was different from the Manjunath they knew in college, who was always jovial, fun-loving, friendly, and a great entertainer. One of his friends finds him, but Manjunath is frantic. They send him back to his hometown. Manjunath's parents try to convince him to leave his job at Bharat Oil that is causing him stress. Initially he seems willing but slowly he realises that he doesn't want to be a quitter. (Manjunath believes that, being from a top institute in the country, he has been given an opportunity. As the eldest son of a mineworker, he has had a humble upbringing.) He realises that the kerosene, mixed with diesel, is coming from ration shops ‚Äî 'it's the poor people's kerosene'. In addition, he becomes conscious of the extent of pollution caused by burning adulterated fuel. He finds strength and comes back to fight, against his parents wishes. There is a clear threat to his life, because he insists on doing his duty to stop petrol adulteration. This time, Manjunath is not deterred. He continues doing what he considers right, without worrying about the consequences. As a result, one night he gets brutally killed by the people who are harmed by his doing his duty. His family and friends suffer over his death. They wonder why he put himself in so much danger. Slowly, the worst fears start coming true. Beyond the initial grief, no one wants to come forward to carry on the fight. In the film, Manjunath is shown watching what happens after he dies. He is starting to feel that it is all pointless. He cannot watch his parents' tears any more: What was their fault? Maybe he should have compromised. But how can people not see what he has? What he fought was something very big and very important. Suddenly, people who have no connection to him realise the importance of what Manjunath did and start trying to do something. Like novices, they search their way around: Their will is strong. They start getting help again from unexpected quarters. It is nerve-wracking, with dangers for everyone. Then, instead of one or two, there are a lot people helping. Manjunath, who has lost hope, realises that it's not all going waste. He hopes and prays that they succeed. The film cuts back and forth from a rock concert. The conflict of the story is not whether Manjunath lived or died, but if the effect of Manjunath lives or dies, and in the end that's the victory.

Secondly, also that the people > fighting his case, did not know him, were not doing it for glory or money, > just strangers, taking on something thousands of miles away, just because > they were inspired by what he did. > I thought these may be ingredients of a story worth telling.\\" =Official support= The film was supported by the Manjunath Shanmugam Trust through which the support of IIM-Lucknow and Manjunath's parents were enlisted. =Filming= Manjunath was primarily shot in Lucknow and areas around, including at the IIM. The rest of the portions were filmed in Mumbai and Bangalore. The filming in U.P. was done under a pseudo-name of being a romantic movie, to avoid the attention of the local people and media. Sandeep and his crew had a close shave with a few corrupt petrol pump owners whilst shooting which forced him to choose the cover story. ‚ÄúUnlike the collective memory of the rest of the country, Manjunath‚Äôs story is still alive in Uttar Pradesh. We didn‚Äôt want to put the 100-crew unit at risk,‚Äù said director Sandeep A. Varma, in an interview with The Indian Express. Music The soundtrack is composed by Sonam Sherpa, Nitin Malik and Subir Malik of Delhi- based rock band Parikrama. The film has four original songs with lyrics penned by Rajneesh Bisht and Sandeep A. Varma. The track \\"Shlokas\\" is the first rock rendition of the Bhagavad Gita in Bollywood. Release Manjunath was released in India on 9 May 2014. Reception =Critical response= Critic Taran Adarsh gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and states that, \\"Manjunath is a film that is realistic, brave and powerful. Critic Subhash K. Jha also gave 3.5 stars out of 5 saying, \\"The director pieces together Manjunath's story like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. For The Times of India, Renuka Vyavahare wrote, \\"One of the least promoted films of the week, Manjunath pleasantly surprises you with its thought-provoking, hard-hitting content and earnest execution. What also set the film apart are its heart-rending parent-child moments and heartfelt performances. Renowned artistes Seema Biswas (as Manju's mother) and Kishor Kadam (Manju's father) deserve awards for their tear-evoking acts.\\" She gave the film 3 stars out of 5. Rajeev Masand for IBN Live gave it a rating of 3/5, calling it \\"An important story that deserves to be heard.\\" Sify.com gave it 3.5 out of 5 saying, \\"Don't miss this rare gem. Varma is an astute storyteller, also showcasing a flair for cinematic style. The atmospherics are delightful, and so are the nuances (right from Manjunath's nerdy dressing sense to his worn-out steering wheel cover). Music by Parikrama is superb, even if too much at times.\\" Rahul Desai for Mumbai Mirror wrote, \\"The sign of a good biopic, like a documentary, is its current relevance and ability to transcend flaws, as well as the first emotion it elicits from viewers. I felt wronged, and grew stronger as things progressed, only to be shaken by the truth of how relatable Manjunath's psychological struggle was. The tragic part is that Manjunath wasn't a hero; he only had his eyes open in an unrelenting world.\\" He gave it 3 stars out of 5. Paloma Sharma for Rediff.com gave it 3 stars out of 5 and said, \\"Several scenes even take place from beyond the grave and this turn of events ruins the fast-paced, crisply edited aspect of the film and hence, the early promise it showed. That said though, Manjunath is a brave film, like the man it is based on, as it openly takes on the issue of caste and class ‚Äì an everyday discrimination that the protagonist faced.\\" =Response from Manjunath's family= In an open letter to DNA, Manjunath's brother S. Raghavendran, as a response to the film's low box office response, wrote, > \\"We saw Manjunath come alive in front of our eyes last weekend in the > theatre near you. A few people had come forward to honour his memory. Why? > Was he useless? Did what he did not matter to anyone? Would you react the > same way if your loved one is brutally killed for doing his duty? > It‚Äôs not a movie with an item song or love story or the one which audience > normally expect.

To create awareness, &Pictures; organised on-ground events at notable colleges as such IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Indore, IIM Lucknow and St. Andrew's College, Mumbai, where a panel discussion was held on the topic ‚ÄúAre heroes like Manjunath ‚Äòbrave‚Äô or ‚Äòstupid‚Äô in doing what they do?‚Äù The panelists included the film's director Sandeep A. Varma; Raghavendran Shanmugam (Manjunath's brother); cast members from the movie like Sasho Satiiysh, Yashpal Sharma and Rajesh Khattar; notable government officials and IPS officers; and faculty members from the institutes.

The formation was known before and when William Phipps Blake traveled across Panama in 1853 on his way to California to join one of the transcontinental railroad surveying parties, he collected a few Gat√∫n Formation fossils.Woodring, 1957, p.42 In the Canal Zone the contact between the formation with the underlying Caimito Formation is covered by the waters of Lake Gat√∫n and even before the flooding of the lake perhaps all of the contact was concealed by swamps.Woodring, 1957, p.43 Massive medium- to very fine-grained sandstones and siltstones are the chief constituents of the Gat√∫n Formation. They are somewhat calcareous, or marly, somewhat tuffaceous, and have a clay-like matrix. The sandstone contains numerous grains of black and greenish volcanic rocks and is practically a subgraywacke. Conglomerates and hard brittle very fine-grained tuff make up a small part of the formation. Basalt intrudes older formations in the Lake Gat√∫n area, but is not known to penetrate the Gat√∫n Formation.

It opened in 1897 and closed in 1961. Between 1898 and 1910, it was the proposed junction for the planned Vale of Glamorgan Light Railway. Design The station was one of the five original stations opened in 1897. It had two platforms with brick station buildings on the 'down' platform and the signal box centrally placed on the up platform. There were platform loops on both sides, so four lines of rails ran through the station (the loops were later removed) and the goods yard on the 'down' side was similar to the others on the line, though had an additional crossover halfway along the loop siding. In 1913, a corrugated iron goods shed was built on the 'down' platform.Chapman 1998, p. 157 Locale Unlike the four other large stations, Southerndown Road was not located in a settlement and had almost no nearby habitation at all. It acted as a feeder station for a very wide rural area. It had been built with hopes of a branch line to Southerndown itself. Vale of Glamorgan Light Railway From the mid-nineteenth century onward, Southerndown had been a popular holiday destination and had the possibility of becoming a resort town. However, this development was limited by the absence of railway connection.Chapman 1998, p. 51 From at least 1890, a horse brake service had operated between Bridgend railway station and Southerndown, but as this was operated by the Great Western Railway, it was of no use to the Barry Railway which was by then running the Vale of Glamorgan line. The passing of the Light Railways Act offered the chance of building lines economically and over the next decade or so, various schemes were proposed for the light railway, but none came to fruition. First Scheme In September 1897, the support of the Barry Railway was promised to the Vale of Glamorgan Company. The proposed line would be two miles and three quarters long with a ruling gradient of 1 in 50. The estimated cost was ¬£13,500. The surveys were completed and notices prepared for submission to the Light Railway Commissioners, but the scheme went no further owing to the opposition of the principal landowner on the route. Subsequently, an alternative route was prepared. Second Scheme The alternative route prepared by the engineer was five miles long. It was to leave the main line at Ewenny and follow the River Ogmore to Ogmore-by-Sea before proceeding along the coast to Southerndown. The estimated costs were ¬£20,000 with an additional ¬£3000 needed for the curve towards Barry. The Barry Railway balked at these costs and the plans were abandoned. In 1899, a horse brake service was introduced to connect Southerndown Road with the village.Chapman 1998, p. 53 Third Scheme The need for a better connection still lingered and led the Barry company to consider the possibility of a motor bus service, but this was considered financially undesirable. In 1904, they subsequently returned to the idea of a light railway and three possible routes were prepared. The first was more or less identical to the first scheme of 1897 and would've cost ¬£19,000. Another following the opposite side of the valley from Southerndown Road station would cost ¬£2000 less. The third route left the line at Ewenny and followed the dry valley towards St Brides Major. The route would require the erection of platforms at Ewenny and had a maximum gradient of 1 in 27. Th estimated cost were ¬£21,000. None of these plans were proceeded with. Fourth Scheme Later in 1904, the Barry Directors instructed their engineer to investigate the possibility of a tramway between Bridgend and Southerndown. This proposal would cost ¬£30,000 and would probably have attracted passengers from the Great Western line rather than via Barry. On 30 June 1904, the Barry company decided to postpone discussion on the matter until the local authorities were prepared to allow level crossings on the route. Despite this, plans never were resumed and dried up after this point. The horse brake continued to operate until 1915 when motor buses were introduced to the area. In retrospect, it is unlikely that a light railway could have thrived for long in such an environment.Chapman 1998, p. 54 Later years and closure Southerndown Road was the only station which did not profit from the influx of traffic to and from the new RAF bases built in the 1930s.Chapman 1998, p. 79 The station closed entirely in 1961. It was the only one on the line to do so before the passenger service was withdrawn in 1964.Chapman 1998, p. 87 Notes References Chapman, Colin (1998) The Vale of Glamorgan Railway The Oakwood Press Category:Disused railway stations in the Vale of Glamorgan Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1897 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1961 Category:Former Barry Railway stations ","title":"Southerndown Road railway station"},{"id":"43334263","text":"The Brito Formation is a geologic formation in Honduras.

The scale was released in 2009 by Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.http://www.yale.edu/graduateschool/publications/news/201109/gearhardt- food-addiction.html It was found that the brain mechanisms in people with food addiction were similar to those in people with substance dependence, such as drug addicts.Meule, Adrian, and Ashley N. Gearhardt. \\"Five years of the Yale Food Addiction Scale: Taking stock and moving forward.\\" Current Addiction Reports 1.3(2014): 193-205. Print. While there is currently no official diagnosis of \\"food addiction\\", the YFAS was created to identify persons who exhibited symptoms of dependency towards certain food. Foods most notably identified by YFAS to cause food addiction were those high in fat and high in sugar. A self-reported standardized tool was created by a Yale researcher, Ashley Gearhardt, to determine those individuals at high risk for food addiction, regardless of weight. Food addiction The term food addiction remains a controversial topic. The concept of food addiction addresses a person‚Äôs behavioral and neurophysiological changes with certain foods that closely resemble findings found in persons with substance dependence. The term became especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century, driven by the ‚Äúobesity epidemic‚Äù.Corwin, R. L., and P. S. Grigson. \\"Symposium Overview--Food Addiction: Fact Or Fiction?.\\" Journal of Nutrition 139(2009): 617-619. Print Earlier studies suggest that food addiction, similar to that of drug addiction, mainly exert their actions through the dopamine and opiate pathways.Gearhardt, AN, Corbin, WR, and Brownell, KD. \\"Preliminary validation of the Yale Food Addiction Scale.\\" Appetite 52(2009): 430-436.Print. Using Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) subjects regardless of Body mass index(BMI), with high food addiction score compared to those with lower scores, showed significant differences in brain activity. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Scripps Research Institute found that rats fed a high-fat palatable diet for extended periods, overstimulated the brain‚Äôs reward system, similar to brain activity in drug addiction.Johnson, Paul M, and Kenny, Paul J. \\"Dopamine D2 receptors in addiction-like reward dysfunction and compulsive eating in obese rats.\\" Nature Neuroscience 13 (2010): 635-641. nature neuroscience. Web. 18 July 2014. http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n5/full/nn.2519.html Development of YFAS To address the need for a standardized tool to identify persons with food addiction behaviors, psychologist Ashley Gearhardt, along with her colleagues William R. Corbin and Kelly D. Brownell, developed the Yale Food Addiction Scale while completing her graduate research at Yale University as a clinical psychology doctoral student. Gearhardt and colleagues formatted their questionnaire to be based upon content of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV ‚Äútext revision‚Äù for substance dependence and was reviewed by experts in the fields of addiction, obesity, and eating pathology for revision. Content YFAS contains 25 self-reported questions in dichotomous and Likert-type format. In the original scale, two items were included to determine the foods that triggered dependence. When filling out the questionnaire, subjects are asked to refer to the past 12 months of behaviors. The questions fall under seven specific substance dependence criteria as defined by the DSM-IV, as well as clinically significant impairment. The seven criteria per the instruction sheet for the YFAS are: # Substance taken in larger amount and for longer period than intended. # Persistent desire or repeated unsuccessful attempt to quit. # Much time/activity to obtain, use, recover, # Important social, occupational, or recreation activities given up or reduced. # Use continues despite knowledge of adverse consequences (e.g., failure to fulfill role obligation, use when physically hazardous). # Tolerance (marked increase in amount; marked decrease in effect). # Characteristic withdrawal symptoms; substance taken to relieve withdrawal. Food addiction is recognized when an individual meets at least three of the above symptom criteria and scores for clinically significant impairment or distress. A German version is available and a French version was utilized in a food addiction study targeting overweight and obese women. Foods emphasized The YFAS survey identified certain foods that were likely to trigger dependence symptoms. These foods correlate with the high-fat, high- sugar foods selected in prior food addiction studies, however, the survey subject is instructed to think of any foods or food groups that cause positive symptoms identified in the questionnaire. The YFAS questionnaire lists the following foods: * Sweets like ice cream, chocolate, doughnuts, cookies, cake, candy * Starches like white bread, rolls, pasta, and rice * Salty snacks like chips, pretzels, and crackers * Fatty foods like steak, bacon, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, pizza, and French fries * Sugary drinks like soda pop Modified scales A shortened YFAS (mYFAS) consisting of only nine items was proposed in 2014 which had similar prevalence rates as the 25-item YFAS. To address the role food addiction plays in children, the original adult YFAS was adjusted. The Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C) includes more age-appropriate activities, a lowered reading level, and a new scoring threshold.Gearheardt, Ashley N, Roberto, Christina A., Seamans, Marissa J., Corbin, William R., Brownell, Kelly D.. \\"Preliminary validation of the Yale Food Addiction Scale for children.\\" Eating Behaviors 14 (2013): 508‚Äì512. Print. Limitations Incidence of scores positive for food addiction were higher in overweight and obese patients. However, further research is needed to define the correlation of YFAS scores in regards to BMI. Previous studies have shown mixed results mainly due to limited sample size, concurrent eating disorders, and lack of clinical controls. Five years after development of YFAS, Gearhardt and Adrian Meule summarized its utilization in research studies and its limitations. Gearhardt and Meule concluded: \\"Although, the YFAS is not sufficient evidence that 'food addiction' exists, it does provide a standardized tool to identify individuals who are the most likely to be experiencing an addictive response to food.\\" References External links * Yale Food Addiction Scale * Instruction Sheet for the Yale Food Addiction Scale Category:Yale University Category:Psychiatric instruments: eating disorders F ","title":"Yale Food Addiction Scale"},{"id":"43334427","text":"Thistleton may refer to: ;Places *Thistleton in Rutland, England *Thistleton in the parish of Greenhalgh-with-Thistleton, in Fylde, Lancashire, England *Thistleton, Kingston upon Hull, a former place ;People *Katie Thistleton ((born 1989), Children's BBC television presenter *Thiselton-Dyer, an English surname ","title":"Thistleton (disambiguation)"},{"id":"43334429","text":"Rose Valois was the name of a millinery establishment in Paris founded in 1927 by Madame Fernand Cleuet, Vera Leigh, and one other.

Pitts Jr. (January 10, 1921 ‚Äì June 19, 2014) was an American chemist and researcher known for his work in the fields of photochemistry and atmospheric chemistry. Pitts was a pioneer in the study of smog and air pollution, especially in Los Angeles County. Pitts co-founded the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center at the University of California, Riverside in 1961 and served as the center's director from 1970 to 1988. He authored more than 400 scientific publications and four books on the subjects, especially smog. Pitts' research formed the basis for California's air quality laws. According to the chair of the Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols, \\"Jim Pitts was probably the single person most responsible for the understanding of what strategies we need to clean up Southern California's air...He was able to explain all of this in English to policymakers so that they would be able to accept that it was going to take extensive and difficult actions to control emissions.\\" He often invited state and federal officials to his smog chamber at UC Irvine, including Jerry Brown and Ronald Reagan, to demonstrate the effects of smog and air pollution. In a common demonstration, Pitts would fill an Erlenmeyer flask with ozone and then twist a slice of lemon onto the flask. The ensuing chemical reaction, which quickly produced a fog, demonstrated the formation of smog in the atmosphere. Pitts refused funding from industry groups, which increased his center's credibility. He was the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions from the California State Assembly, the United States Congress, the Coalition for Clean Air, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and the California state air board. Pitts was born on January 10, 1921, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Esther (n√©e Bengtson) and James N. Pitts. The family moved to West Los Angeles when he was just six months old. A high school teacher sparked his interest in chemistry during his junior year. Pitts enrolled as a chemistry student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1939. He left during World War II, joining a group of young scientists who conducted classified chemical warfare field tests. Their work led to the development of more effective gas mask for Allied forces during the war. He returned to UCLA, where he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1945 and a doctorate in 1949. Pitts initially worked as a faculty member of Northwestern University. He was at the time married to a woman by the name of Nancy Ann Quirt. James and Nancy had three daughters Linda, Christie and Beckie. Pitts was hired as a founding professor at UC Riverside in 1954. Pitts married his second wife, UC Irvine chemist and professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts in 1970. He followed her to the University of California, Irvine in 1994, where the two collaborated of research and co- authored books and other publications. James Pitts died of natural causes at his home in Irvine, California, on June 19, 2014, at the age of 93.

It is now a local history museum, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The former Sandown Depot is located on the north side of the village center of Sandown, just off Main Street between Depot Road and the former railroad right-of-way now occupied by the Rockingham Recreational Trail. It is a single-story wood frame structure, measuring about . Its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards, and it is covered by a broad low-pitch hip roof, whose eaves extend well beyond the structure and are supported by large knee brackets. The track side of the building has a projecting window bay near the center, next to which a semaphore mast rises through the roof. The interior is divided into sections historically used as passenger waiting areas (one each for men and women), freight storage, and the station master's office and telegraph dispatch. Portions of the interior have been modernized. This station was built in 1873-74 by the Nashua and Rochester Railroad, which was eventually absorbed by the Boston and Maine. The station was a major location on a heavily traveled single track, with support services including a telegraph office, post office, freight depot, and a large siding area with capacity for 62 cars. It consequently became a major point of civic activity in the rural town. Rail traffic declined in the early 1930s, and the rails were taken up in 1935. The depot building was used by the state highway department as a storage facility between 1934 and 1977, and has since been converted to a local history museum.

Roycemore began classes at 1200 Davis Street in Evanston on January 6, 2012.  Post- Roycemore Usage  Despite zoning that allows Northwestern to utilize the property as a dormitory, neighbors have voiced objections to the possibility. Dormitories are considered to be the least favorite potential reuse of the site amongst nearby residents. Also, despite the building having hosted classes for the near-century the Roycemore School was housed there, some neighbors also objected to the idea of Northwestern utilizing the site for university classes. Many neighbors reiterated longtime objections to the housing of student housing located west of Sheridan Road, complaining of the noise produced by students' late-night partying and their commuting to and from classes and the disruption it causes for the single-family homes nearby. The City of Evanston has objected to potential redevelopment of the site that would require demolition or partial demolition of the structure, as it considers most of the interconnected buildings the make up the components of the structure to be local landmarks, and Northwestern's associate vice president of facilities management Ron Nayler has stated that the University only intends to restore the landmark buildings, rather than demolish them. Nayler did however say that the school may potentially replace a home on the site that is not itself landmark. Potential uses zoning would allow encompass, amongst other things, housing for fraternities and sororities, faculty or administrative offices, student dormitories, university classrooms, and upperclass-student housing. Development on the site would directly impact the adjacent residential neighborhood, which includes a new single-family housing development across Orrington Avenue. In the meantime, Northwestern has been intending to utilize the building through interim uses. Temporary uses have included utilization by Northwestern's art program during renovations of Kresge Hall.  Usage in Media  A scene featuring Matt Damon was shot for the film Contagion on an empty lot across from Roycemore School, with the school and nearby houses providing background.

With a construction history dating to 1676, it is one of New Hampshire's oldest buildings, and is a rare example of a formerly fortified garrison house in its original location. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Edward Sewall Garrison is located in a residential area west of downtown Exeter, on the south side of Epping Road facing the Park Street Common. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main block is four bays wide, arranged slightly asymmetrically, with the main entrance in the center-left bay and interior chimneys at the sides. There are enclosed porches on each side, and ells extending to the rear and the right. The oldest portion of this house, the northern portion of its main block, is a (formerly) fortified garrison house built in 1676. This section retains evidence of this early history in its walls, which contain evidence of brick infill and small windows typical of the period. The southern portion of the main block was added c. 1730‚Äì1751, and includes its original chimney. Additions were added to the rear in 1810 and 1880, the latter adding Victorian woodwork detailing. The house was modernized in 1911, obscuring some details and modernizing others, but later owners have worked to expose the historical elements of the structure. The house is one of the only garrison houses in the state that is in its original location.

Background Until the late 1980s, in an effort to reduce a shortage of school teachers in New Zealand, the Ministry of Education stated that people who completed a teachers course at university, upon graduation, would be employed for 2 years as a teacher by the ministry. However, with declining numbers of students, and a substantial budget deficit, the government ceased this guarantee of employment, and when Ms Hollaway graduated as a teacher she was not offered the promised employment. Not happy with this, Holloway sued the Ministry of Education in the Employment Court. Held The Court of Appeal ruled that the Ministry of Education's statements of \\"will be appointed [as a teacher]\\" was a unilateral contract, thus there was a legally binding obligation to employ Ms Holloway. Footnote: Although Holloway won the battle of whether there was a legally binding employment contract, she at the same time lost the war, as the Court of Appeal ruled that the Employment Court had no jurisdiction to hear such a case in the first place, leaving Holloway having to refile her claim via the District Court instead.

The legal distinction between the two is important, as an \\"inquiry\\" still leaves the original offer live (and still subject to acceptance), whereas a \\"counteroffer\\" cancels the previous offer. Background The two parties were negotiating a sale of a property. Daley's, the sellers, sent to Powierza, via their real estate agent Lee, a sale agreement for $405,000, with a condition of a $40,000 deposit. Poweirza agreed to the sale price, but changed the deposit on the sale agreement to $20,000. The vendor had just changed the deposit from $20,000 to $40,000, and the purchaser changed the deposit back to $20,000, signing the sales agreement, and got Lee to return it to the vendor to consider, which the vendor refused to accept. Nor was his next inquiry of splitting the deposit into 2 instalments accepted either. Powierza then amended the sales agreement deposit back to the original $40,000, signed it, and returned it to Daley. But by then, the property had been sold elsewhere as Daley had received a higher offer of $435,000 from a 3rd party. Powierza considered the original sales offer was still open for his acceptance, and sued the Daley's. The Daley's response was that his alterations to the contract were a counteroffer, making the original offer to be at an end. Held The Court of Appeal upheld that the alteration in the sales agreement was merely an inquiry, and not a counter offer, making the original contract still enforceable against the vendor. Cooke J stated \\"The line between rejecting an offer and merely inquiring as to a possible variation can be a fine one, but the basic test is the effect on a reasonable person in the shoes of the offerer\\".

He was formerly its associate director, and currently serves as the Global Oscillations Network Group program manager. Research on the sunspot cycle In 2011, Hill's research, which had used helioseismography to monitor streams below the surface of the sun, attracted considerable media attention. Although such streams tend to be the \\"spawning ground\\" for sunspots, and they had been expected to begin forming in 2008, the study found that these new streams had yet to form. The study in question therefore suggested that the sunspot cycle was going to take longer than expected to reach its next peak, or, according to Hill, might not happen at all. Although Hill and his colleagues refused to discuss the possible effects this weaker solar cycle would have on climate, this was reported on by some media, including the Global Warming Policy Foundation, as evidence that a \\"mini ice age\\" was imminent. Hill responded to these reports by telling Reuters that \\"We have not predicted a Little Ice Age,\\" but rather that \\"We have predicted something going on with the Sun.\\" In an NSO press release, Hill added that \\"In my opinion, it is a huge leap from that to an abrupt global cooling, since the connections between solar activity and climate are still very poorly understood.

The approval was not limited to just conveyancing matters. Mr Frampton subsequently refused to give approval for the sale, for non conveyancing reasons.

Sherwood quarreled with Boulton in the press, accusing him of running a star chamber proceeding against him, resulting in Boulton recommending Sherwood's suspension to city council. Council voted 14 to 10 in favour of Sherwood resulting in Boulton resigning as mayor, though he ran in the subsequent election. The scandal resulted in provincial legislation that required the appointment of an independent police board. The body, the Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was appointed in 1859 and fired Sherwood and the entire police force in order to replace them with a better trained, disciplined force.

Built about 1815, it is unusual in the city as a particularly well-preserved example of a Federal period double house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is owned by the Strawbery Banke Foundation. Description and history The Shapley House is located southeast of downtown Portsmouth, on the south side of Court Street between Atkinson and Marcy streets. It is a three-story structure, built with load-bearing brick walls. Its front facade is six bays wide, with a symmetrical arrangement that has entrances in the two center bays, topped by semi-elliptical fanlights. Windows are six-over-six sash on the lower two floors, and three-over-three on the third. The roof cornice exhibits shallow brick corbelling. The \\"best\\" rooms of the interior feature delicate Federal period wainscoting, and have mantelpieces supported by six engaged columns. The house was built c. 1815 by Captain Reuben Shapley, a ship's captain and merchant. Although it was one of a number of brick buildings built in the wake of an 1813 fire that devastated Portsmouth's downtown area, its construction as a double house is distinctive. From the outside it looks like a single-family residence except for its two entrances, an apparently deliberate decision. The halves of the house are separated by a brick firewall extending the full depth and height of the house. Window sills and other trim on one side are in marble, while these elements on the other side are of wood. It is one of the city's best-preserved Federal buildings. This house at 420 Court St., Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is also known as the Reuben Shapley (who built it) House. It has been restored and is part of the Strawbery Banke Museum complex.
