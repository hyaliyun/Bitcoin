It appears at the end of the fourth week, when the yolk sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped vesicle (the umbilical vesicle). Function=Obliteration Generally, the duct fully obliterates (narrows and disappears) during the 5‚Äì6th week of fertilization age (9th week of gestational age), but a failure of the duct to close is termed a vitelline fistula. This results in discharge of meconium from the umbilicus. About two percent of fetuses exhibit a type of vitelline fistula characterized by persistence of the proximal part of the vitelline duct as a diverticulum protruding from the small intestine, Meckel's diverticulum, which is situated about two feet above the ileocecal junction and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus. Persistence The vesicle can be seen in the afterbirth as a small, somewhat oval-shaped body, the diameter of which varies from 1 mm to 5 mm. It is situated between the amnion and the chorion and may lie on or at a varying distance from the placenta. Clinical significance=Meckel's diverticulum Sometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct. On this site of attachment, sometimes a pathological Meckel's diverticulum may be present. A mnemonic used to recall details of a Meckel's diverticulum is as follows: \\"2 inches long, within 2 feet of ileocecal valve, 2 times as common in males than females, 2% of population, 2% symptomatic, 2 types of ectopic tissue: gastric and pancreatic\\". In the decades since the mnemonic was developed, further epidemiology has found the incidence of symptomatic diverticulae to be 4%, not 2%,Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th ed., p. 766 Brant and Helms, Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology, 4th ed., p. 778 and the incidence to be 2-5x greater in males than females, but the mnemonic is still helpful.

It airs a classic hits format (and Christmas Music from early-November until December 25 or 26th). WTRY-FM serves the New York State Capital District and Mohawk Valley in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy radio market. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, and broadcasts at 6,000 watts ERP from a tower in between Altamont and Duanesburg off U.S. Route 20.Radio- Locator.com/WTRY-FM Studios and offices are on Troy-Schenectady Road (Route 7) in Latham.983TRY.iheart.com/contact The classic hits format on WTRY-FM is a direct continuation of the oldies format which was previously heard on AM 980. The original WTRY was a highly popular Top 40 station in the Albany market through the 1960s and 70s, moving over to oldies in the 80s and 90s, and today is sports radio 980 WOFX. WTRY-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format, with Christmas music heard on its HD-3 channel branded as, iHeartChristmas Classics. When WTRY-FM switches to Christmas music, the normal classic hits format moves over to its HD-3 channel. History=Pre-launch and early formats The first decade of 98.3 was quite unstable. A testament of this can be seen even before it went on the air. In its construction permit stage, 98.3 was to become WDNZ with an early dance/rhythmic contemporary format. However, permit owner Dennis Jackson (now a noted community broadcaster in smaller towns throughout the Northeast) was forced to sell the station before it hit the air. Under new owners, another set of call letters (WERV) came and went before the frequency signed on as adult contemporary WNYJ on December 18, 1986.Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-197 Being a new frequency, completely satellite-fed, and going up against a popular AC station 100.9 WKLI-FM, the format on 98.3 was changed in late 1988 to oldies as Cruisin' 98.3, still keeping the WNYJ call sign. 98.3/103.5 SHO-FM In mid 1989, WNYJ was sold and returned to adult contemporary music as WSHZ SHO-FM, adding a simulcast on 103.5 WACS-FM in Cobleskill (which became WSHQ). WSHZ/WSHQ's adult contemporary format was not successful, and in late September 1990, the format was flipped back to oldies, still as SHO-FM (though it was known as Super Hit Oldies SHO-FM in 1990). A few days later, 99.5 WGY-FM flipped to oldies as well, causing major problems for both WSHZ/WSHQ and AM 980 WTRY. First WTRY simulcast/Star 98.3 Looking for a boost, then-WTRY owner Liberty Broadcasting entered into a local marketing agreement with WSHZ in late 1991 and flipped 98.3 to a simulcast of 980, both stations playing oldies. This arrangement proved successful, outlasting WGY-FM (which switched to a hot adult contemporary format as WRVE in 1994). By the end of 1991 the simulcast ended with 98.3 moving to a 1970s music format, as WYSR Star 98.3. (After 98.3 dropped the Star branding in 1996, the name was reused by 101.3 WQAR from 1998 to 2013 under a different format.) Second WTRY simulcast and move to FM In August 1996, WYSR became an outright sister to WTRY when SFX Broadcasting (which bought Liberty earlier that year) bought WYSR from Jarad Broadcasting. Three months later, the simulcast was restored but with a couple wrinkles: 980 would be simulcasting 98.3 rather than vice versa, and 98.3 broadcast its own morning show while 980 aired the syndicated Imus in the Morning. After Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) purchased AMFM in 2000, the simulcast ended in September of that year, when 980 flipped to sports as WOFX. Format evolution WTRY-FM's logo as My Music 98.3 Until 1999, WTRY's oldies format largely featured music from 1964 to 1969 with several pre-1964 oldies an hour and about one early 1970s hit an hour cutting off at about 1973. During the course of 1999, songs up to the late 1970s were mixed in and 1970s music was being played several times an hour cutting a couple 1964 to 1969 songs per hour. In 2001, a few 1980s hits were being mixed into the format being played about once per hour. Later that year pre-1964 oldies began to be cut back to two an hour and by 2002 one per hour. In 2003, the word oldies began to be used less and the station was now focusing on the 1964 to 1975 time period. In 2004, WTRY was now playing about half 1964-1969 songs and about half 1970s songs with a 1980s song mixed in and pre-1964 oldies almost completely gone. By 2005, the station had evolved into more of a classic hits format. Beginning in 2001, WTRY began playing all Christmas music around Thanksgiving until some time on December 26. As time went on this annual tradition began earlier in November. On December 26, 2007, after its annual temporary Christmas format ended, WTRY surprised its listeners with a switch to classic hits, mainly playing songs from the 1970s and 1980s with some '60s songs mixed in, under the My Music slogan. After playing Christmas music from November 1, 2010, the station reverted to oldies of the 1960s and 1970s as of December 27, 2010, in a similar style to sister stations KJR-FM (Seattle) and KLTH (Portland, Oregon). In early February 2011, WTRY continued to evolve towards a more traditional type of oldies format, while facing competition from 96.7 WPTR, which had just flipped to oldies from contemporary Christian. In November 2011, WPTR became Christian talk station WDCD-FM, leaving WTRY and as the only FM oldies radio stations in the Capital Region. logo as Oldies 98.3, 2012-2015 On February 27, 2012, WTRY rebranded as \\"Oldies 98.3\\".

The binding motif is associated with a protein‚Äôs structure and/or function. ATP is a molecule of energy, and can be a coenzyme, involved in a number of biological reactions. ATP is proficient at interacting with other molecules through a binding site. The ATP binding site is the environment in which ATP catalytically actives the enzyme and, as a result, is hydrolyzed to ADP. The binding of ATP causes a conformational change to the enzyme it is interacting with. The genetic and functional similarity of such a motif demonstrates micro-evolution: proteins have co-opted the same binding sequence from other enzymes rather than developing them independently. ATP binding sites, which may be representative of an ATP binding motif, are present in many proteins which require an input of energy (from ATP), such sites as active membrane transporters, microtubule subunits, flagellum proteins, and various hydrolytic and proteolytic enzymes.  Primary sequence  The short motifs involving ATP-binding are the Walker motifs, Walker A, also known as the P-loop, and Walker B, as well as the C motif and switch motif.  Walker A motif  The Walker site A has a primary amino acid sequence of or . The letter can represent any amino acid.  Walker B motif  The primary amino acid sequence of the Walker B site is , in which represents any hydrophobic amino acid.  C motif  The C motif, also known as the signature motif, LSGGQ motif, or the linker peptide, has a primary amino acid sequence of . Due to the variety of different amino acids that can be used in the primary sequence, of both the Walker site A and B, the non-variant amino acids within the sequence are highly conserved. A mutation of any of these amino acids will affect the binding ATP or interfere with the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The primary amino acid sequence determines the three dimensional structure of each motif.  Structure  All of the ATP binding domains are made up of an estimated 250 residues and two subunits, creating a dimer. These residues are folded into six Œ±-helices and five Œ≤-strands. Structure of the nucleotide binding domain of ATP-binding cassette transporters  Walker A motif  Structurally, the Walker A motif consists of an Œ±-helix and is always followed by a glycine-rich loop.  Walker B motif  The Walker B motif is a Œ≤-strand. The Walker motifs are connected to each other by a peptide sequence of about 100 residues. Structurally, these connecting residues fold into an Œ±-helical domain.  C motif  Directly following the Walker B motif, is the signature motif.  Switch motif  The switch motif has been found to be located at the end of the Œ≤4-strand in ATP-binding proteins.  Function  Each ATP binding motif has a different role to play whether it is directly involved with the binding of ATP or helping with the construction of the ATP- binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The ATP molecule binds to the connecting point of each subunit of the dimer, indicating that ATP is in close proximity to both subunits during catalysis. The two binding motifs that ATP directly interacts with is the residues from the Walker A motif, located on one of the subunits, and the residues from the C binding motif, located on the other subunit. The Walker A binding motif has a lysine side chain, which is essential for the binding of ATP. The lysine residue forms hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of two phosphate groups within ATP, therefore creating proximity and orientation of ATP in the binding site. In order for the Walker A motif to bind to ATP, the ATP molecule must be in the binding site. The signature motif acts as a signal to the Walker A motif, letting the Walker A know when the ATP molecule has bound to the binding site. The signature motif does this by allowing its residues to extend from the subunit they are located into the other subunit where the Walker A motif is. It is necessary that ATP binds to both nucleotide binding domains in order to complete the catalytically active structure. The Walker B motif contains the amino acid glutamate within the short sequence. Glutamate can be used to perform a nucleophilic attack on the ATP molecule. Found in the switch binding motif is a histidine residue. The function of the histidine is to influence the reaction catalytically by contacting the residues across the dimer interface, including the Walker A motif and the Walker B motif. It is the histidine residue that forms the tight coupling between the binding of the ATP molecule and the dimer. Following the hydrolysis of ADP, a conformational change must occur to separate the ATP-binding cassette. This separation is driven by an electrostatic repulsion by the ADP product that is bound the Walker A motif and the inorganic phosphate product is bound to the C motif.

Historical Background  In East Africa regional higher education interactions and cooperation originates from the pre-independence era when Makerere University College was the only higher education institution in the region serving students from Kenya, the then Tanganyika, and Zanzibar in East Africa as well as from the then Rhodesia and Nyasaland in central and southern Africa, which now consist of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Later in 1963, university colleges were formed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as constituent colleges of the then University of East Africa that had been established during the era of independence of the four countries (Uganda, Kenya, Zanzibar and Tanganyika). Makerere College was the third constituent college of the University of East Africa. In 1970, the University of East Africa was dissolved and the University of Dar es Salaam, Makerere University and the University of Nairobi were established as separate national universities for Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya respectively. In the same year, due to the need to maintain collaboration between these universities the Inter-University Committee (IUC) was established under the auspices of the first EAC. The role of IUC was to facilitate contact and cooperation among the three universities (University of Dar es Salaam, Makerere University and University of Nairobi). IUC was hosted in Kampala, Uganda. In 1977, the former EAC collapsed and the support that IUC was receiving from the Partner States declined. However, IUC continued to coordinate cooperation between the three universities albeit with resource constraints that severely limited its functions.  Establishment of IUCEA  In 1980, after consultations involving permanent/principal secretaries responsible for higher education in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, the vice chancellors of the universities in the three countries met in Nairobi (Kenya) to discuss the future of the cooperation of their institutions. They agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) committing them to maintain cooperation between their universities within the IUC framework. The MoU was subsequently signed, which also led to the transformation of IUC into the current Inter-university Council for East Africa (IUCEA). The MoU spelt out the objectives, functions, membership and governance of IUCEA, and, just like IUC, IUCEA continued and still is hosted in Kampala, Uganda. IUCEA played its role very well until 1992 when decline in financial support from the three governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda made it impossible to carry out the collaborative activities. This raised concern about institutional sustainability and hence prompted a study by the Commonwealth Higher Education Management Services (CHEMS) between November 1998 and March 1999 with a view to revitalizing IUCEA. The aim of the study was to develop a viable strategy for expansion and sustainability of IUCEA.  Revitalized IUCEA and Integration into EAC Framework  The Treaty for the Establishment of the current East African Community (The Treaty) was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on 7 July 2000 following its ratification by the original three Partner States, namely Republic of Kenya, Republic of Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. The Republic of Burundi and the Republic of Rwanda acceded to the EAC Treaty on 18 June 2007 and became full Members of the Community with effect from 1 July 2007. Upon its re-establishment, EAC recognized IUCEA as one of the surviving institutions of the former Community. Therefore, it was agreed to establish IUCEA as an institution of the new EAC. In that process in 2000 IUCEA underwent revitalization following the recommendations of the CHEMS study and in 2002 the Ministers responsible for Higher Education of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed the IUCEA Protocol as an instrument that made IUCEA a legal body corporate of EAC.  The IUCEA Act, 2009  In 2009 the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) enacted the IUCEA Act 2009, thus effectively integrating IUCEA into the EAC operational framework. The Act spells out the objectives, functions, institutional set up and systems of governance and management of IUCEA. According to the Act any university, university college and degree awarding institution may apply for and get admitted to the IUCEA membership as long as it is properly incorporated in the EAC Partner State where it is operating and is pursuing objectives that are consistent with the functions of IUCEA as spelt out in the Act.

The church was built following the wars between the Germans and the Khoikhoi, Herero, and Owambo. The foundation stone was laid on 11 August 1907, while on 16 October 1910 the church was officially dedicated. It was originally known as the Church of Peace. Christ Church was constructed from quartz sandstone mined from the vicinity of Avis Dam. It has a mixture of neo-Romanesque, Art Nouveau and Gothic revival influences. Its spire is high. Reiterdenkmal The portico was made from Carrara marble imported from Italy. The clock and part of the roof was shipped from Germany, as were the three bronze bells cast by Franz Schilling. They bear the inscriptions \\"Ehre sei Gott in der H√∂he\\" (Glory to God in the highest), \\"Friede auf Erden\\" (Peace on earth), and \\"Den Menschen ein Wohlgefallen\\" (Goodwill towards men). During a confirmation service in the 1960 the clapper of the main bell came loose, smashed through the window and fell on the street. Window bars were installed in reaction to this. The colorful stained lead glass windows in the sanctuary were a gift from Emperor Wilhelm II. In the late 1990s a tourist noticed that all of them were installed with the sun protection on the inside. In the two years following this discovery, all window elements were restored and turned around. The church is located on a traffic island on Robert Mugabe Avenue, opposite the Tintenpalast.

Leon Botstein is the orchestra's music director and principal conductor. They perform regularly at Carnegie Hall and Symphony Space in New York City. Its concertmaster is Erica Kiesewetter. History Stokowski was 80 years old when he founded the orchestra. He served as music director together with assistant Amos Meller until May 1972 when, at the age of 90, he returned to England. Following Maestro Stokowski's departure, Kazuyoshi Akiyama was appointed music director from 1973 to 1978. Music directors during the early 1980s included as principal conductors, Moshe Atzmon and Giuseppe Patan√®. In 1985, John Mauceri assumed the post as music director. In 1991, Catherine Comet left her post at the end of her tenure with the orchestra and was succeeded by Bard College president Leon Botstein. Present day Under music director Leon Botstein, the ASO has pioneered the concept of presenting concerts curated around various themes drawn from the visual arts, literature, politics, and history, and unearthing rarely performed masterworks for well-deserved revival. These concerts are performed in the Vanguard Series at Carnegie Hall. The ASO seeks to preserve the rare works it performs from disappearing from the repertoire. While some rare works are available with complete parts and a score in usable condition, others require extensive restoration and even creation to render them performable. ASO‚Äôs efforts to create these parts mean that these works are now available for performance by other orchestras. The orchestra also performs in the concert series Classics Declassified at Peter Norton Symphony Space, and is the resident orchestra of the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts. In 2010, the American Symphony became the resident orchestra of The Collegiate Chorale, performing regularly in the Chorale‚Äôs New York concert series. The orchestra has made several tours of Asia and Europe, and has performed in numerous benefits for organizations including the Jerusalem Foundation and PBS. ASO‚Äôs award-winning music education program, Music Notes, integrates symphonic music into core humanities classes in high schools across the tri-state area. Recordings In addition to many albums released on the Telarc, New World, Bridge, Koch, and Vanguard labels, many live performances by the American Symphony are now available for digital download.

Following an incident in the Zadar hinterland in which a Croatian policeman was killed, reportedly by SAO Krajina militiamen, Croatian civilians vandalized, destroyed and looted properties belonging to ethnic Serbs and Yugoslav companies in the city. Background Tensions between Croats and Serbs increased steadily through 1990 and 1991 following the electoral victory of the separatist Croatian Democratic Union party, led by Franjo Tuƒëman. Many Serbs were opposed to the prospect of destroying the unity of Yugoslavia. In the summer of 1990, they took up arms in the largely Serb-populated regions of inland Dalmatia, calling the breakaway region \\"SAO Krajina\\", sealing roads and effectively blocking Dalmatia from the coast. The insurrection spread to the eastern region of Slavonia in early 1991, when paramilitary groups from Serbia itself took up positions in the region and started to expel non-Serbs from the area, reportedly associated with the Serbian Radical Party.Prosecutor against Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, icty.org, 15 January 2003. On 2 May 1991, paramilitaries killed twelve Croatian policemen in Borovo Selo and reportedly mutilated some or all of the bodies. This was, at the time, the bloodiest single incident in the Croatian conflict, and it caused widespread shock and outrage in Croatia. The killings produced an immediate upsurge in ethnic tensions.James Gow. The Serbian Project and its Adversaries, p. 159. C. Hurst & Co, 2003. Riot On 2 May, a 23-year-old Croatian policeman, Franko Lisica, was killed near Polaƒça in northern Dalmatia. The police attributed his death to close range enemy weapons fire, presumably by Krajina Serb militiamen. Later the same day, on 2 May 1991, a group of people entered Zadar from its southeastern suburb of Ga≈æenica, starting a riot whose apparent aim was to destroy and loot properties belonging either to ethnic Serbs or to Yugoslav companies such as JAT. The rioting started in the afternoon and lasted for hours, while the damaged properties were still being looted by individuals the following day. ƒêuro Kresoviƒá, at the time the head of the Criminal department of the Municipal Court of Zadar, witnessed the effects of the riot on 3 May and assessed the number of demolished properties at over 130, given that an insurance company made a list of 136 destroyed properties. As there were so many broken windows in the city centre streets, the next day Narodni list, a Zadar newspaper, published the headline Zadarska noƒá kristala (roughly translated as \\"Zadar's night of [broken] glass\\", and the incident was later referred to by some sources as the kristalna noƒá (or Kristallnacht) of Zadar. The Croatian police response was inadequate, while the insurance company Croatia osiguranje agreed to compensate the Serb business owners for the riot damage. ƒêuro Kresoviƒá claimed the police station in Zadar and many of its uniformed officers were actively involved in the lead-up to the riot and the rioting itself. Kresoviƒá was demoted and afterwards discharged from his position at the Municipal Court. Immediately afterwards, anti-Croat rioting took place in the Krajina. Aftermath A separate protest at the naval headquarters in Split, the 1991 protest in Split, happened on 6 May, where one Yugoslav Army soldier was killed and another wounded by protestors.Soldier killed in Croatian protest Associated Press, 7 May 1991 In July, JNA and Serb forces launched the attack on Croatian-populated Dalmatia, starting the battle of Zadar, in which there were 34 casualties. In 1995, the government of FR Yugoslavia made a report that claimed the number of properties destroyed to have been at least 168,Sixth Report of the FRY Government on War Crimes committed in the territory of the former SFRY, December 1995 and it accused local HDZ officials of having instigated the violence. It claimed that the riot was \\"organized by a number of the HDZ activists and the highest-ranking officials in Zadar, in the presence of highest-ranking HDZ officials Vladimir ≈†eks, deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, and Petar ≈†ale\\". The State Attorney's Office in Split had an open case regarding the riot but it was closed with no charges filed in 2002.

It is based on the play adaptation La Dame aux Cam√©lias (The Lady of the Camellias) by Alexandre Dumas, fils, which was first published in French as a novel in 1848 and as a play in 1852. Camille is one of numerous screen adaptations of Dumas, fils story. The film was set in 1920s Paris, whereas the original version took place in Paris in the 1840s. It had lavish Art Deco sets and Rudolph Valentino later married the film's art director, Natacha Rambova. Plot A young law student, Armand (Rudolph Valentino) becomes smitten with a courtesan, Marguerite (Alla Nazimova). Marguerite is constantly surrounded by suitors, whom she entertains at her lavish apartment. She also has consumption and is frequently beset by bouts of illness. Armand sees Marguerite at the opera and, later, pursues her when he attends one of her private parties. She rejects his advances at first, but eventually returns his affection. The two live happily together until Armand's father, seeking to protect his family's reputation, convinces Marguerite to end the relationship. She finally relents and runs away to a wealthy client, leaving a note for Armand. When Armand finds the note he is shattered. The sorrow eventually turns to rage, and he decides to plunge into Parisian nightlife, associating himself with Olympe, another courtesan. When he sees Marguerite at a casino, he publicly denounces her. Marguerite gives up her life as a courtesan and quickly finds herself in massive debt. Her illness also takes a heavy toll. Eventually, as she lies dying in bed, her furniture and belongings are repossessed. She persuades the men taking her belongings to allow her to keep her most precious possession: a book - Manon Lescaut - Armand gave to her. Marguerite dies lying in bed in her apartment holding the book Armand gave her, wishing to sleep where she is happy dreaming about Armand. Marguerite's maid Nanine, and her newlywed friends Gaston and Nichette are at her bedside as she dies. Unlike the original novel, the film does not depict Armand and Marguerite ever seeing each other again after the casino scene and offers no suggestion that Armand ever learned of Marguerite's sacrifice and true feelings for him.

Reception Picture-Play Magazine wrote of the film in their August 1921 issue: \\"The Camille and Armand of tradition are forgotten in the potent lure of the modern characterization of Nazimova and Rudolph Valentino. Bizarre, ephemeral, at moments, and at others, frenzied, their version promises a haunting succession of mesmeric pictures. It does not aim to present the Camille that successive generations have applauded and sniffled over. Because it is Nazimova's presentation of a story that has survived even the buffetings of endless productions‚Äîgood, bad, and indifferent‚Äîit promises to be interesting.\\" Preservation The film has survived and has been made available to the public on DVD and VHS by various film distributors and independent dealers. It is presented as a bonus on the DVD copy of the 1936 version Camille with Greta Garbo.

A throw bag is standard rescue equipment for kayaking and other outdoor river recreational activities. A throw bag is used to rescue someone who is swimming down a river after capsizing their kayak or canoe, but can also be used for gear retrieval and for climbing during portages.  Swimmer rescuehttp://www.nrsweb.com/boating_tips/rescue_bag.asp NRS block text instruction  Usage of a throw bag in a Swift water rescue exercise * Recognition ‚Äì The party with the throw bag needs to see the swimmer and retrieve the throw bag * Preparation ‚Äì Quickly the 'bagger' needs to play out about a meter of rope from the mouth of the bag, and try to get a partner to stand behind them holding onto them, preferably by the life jacket. The bagger, if they have time, should take the meter of revealed rope and take it around their back so they can hold the tail of the rope, and the line feeding into the bag with their body in the loop, resting the rope on their back. * Communication ‚Äì The 'bagger' needs to communicate to the swimmer that they are going to throw a rope, as the rope is best visible in the air, and can be lost by the swimmer when it is in the water. Shouting \\"rope rope rope\\" is a common industry standard by rafting companies. * The Throw ‚Äì The 'bagger' will grasp the meter of played out line in their off hand, and throw the bag either in an underhand or overhand fashion aiming to land the bag past the head of the swimmer, taking care to lead them as they will be moving downstream during the throw. * Anchoring ‚Äì If the rope is caught by the swimmer the thrower should never anchor themselves or you run the risk of ripping the rope out of the swimmers hands. The thrower should move down the gravel bar or river bank to allow a controlled tensioning of the rope and pendulum motion for the swimmer to swing to shore. The thrower should always choose a safe location to make the throw, but avoid creating an anchor other than what is needed for the safety of the thrower. The bagger or the swimmer should NOT wrap the rope around their hand, neck, or body. * Swimmer position ‚Äì The swimmer upon handling the rope needs to turn onto their back with their head pointed upstream and the rope going over their shoulder as they hold it unwrapped in both hands. * The pendulum effect ‚Äì On a straight river the swimmer will be naturally pushed by the current to the shore they have been bagged from. When they get to shore the bagger can start to pull them in, hand over hand.  Gear Rescue ‚Äì V Drag  Applications of the throw bag to rescue gear in a river. Have parties on both sides of a river that is smaller than the length of the line. Throw a bag from one side of the river to the other with both parties holding an end. Attach a person who has a lifejacket with a strong swimmer harness and attach them to the line. Using angles position them the gear and lower them down for rescue with either a pin kit or basic retrieval.

His talks and performances use comedy and storytelling to explore LGBTQ issues, religion, and climate change.  Ex-gay experiences  Because he adhered to Conservative Christian beliefs, Toscano spent seventeen years as part of the ex-gay movement attempting to alter his sexual orientation through conversion therapy and faith-based ex-gay programs. In addition to receiving pastoral counseling, conversion therapy,John Dicker: Two paths diverged: A long and winding road to God, Colorado Springs Independent, 29 January 2004 and discipleship training, he attended several ex-gay programs including Life Ministries in New York City (1983‚Äì1991)Michael Luo. \\"Some Tormented by Homosexuality Look to a controversial Therapy\\", The New York Times, 12 February 2007. and the residential ex-gay program Love in Action in Memphis, Tennessee (July 1996-October 1998).Christine Dinsmore: When a Dos Equis Is More Than a Beer, Out, July/August 2006, Stand: 10 July 2006, bei christinedinsmore.com The conflict between his beliefs and his sexuality led him to consider suicide. He has stated that his experiences in Love in Action \\"felt like ... a biblically induced coma\\". He came out as a gay man in December 1998 and now presents his LGBT-affirming message through theatre and talks at universities, schools, conferences, churches, gay clubs, theaters and on-line through blogs and YouTube videos. In a 2009 interview Toscano explained, \\"I had an aversion to being gay because of the aversion I experienced in the world around me. Now I see that a gay orientation and gender diversity are normal phenomena in the natural world and throughout human history.\\"  Queer Bible Scholarship  As a Bible scholar, Toscano explores LGBTQ issues. He is especially known for highlighting gender non- conforming characters in the Bible. In his performance lecture, Transfigurations--Transgressing Gender in the Bible, he focuses on eunuchs and non-eunuchs who transgress and transcend gender. He first premiered Transfigurations in November 2007 and in March 2017 released the material as a film directed by Samuel Neff. The film was accepted for 2017 and 2018 LGBT film festivals including the 2017 Queer Kampala International Film Festival in December 2017. Moments before Toscano's film was scheduled to screen though, law enforcement agents raided the festival and shut it down. In response, Toscano offered the film for free on-line for a month and festival organizers arranged for a second showing in Kampala at an undisclosed location in January. After seeing Toscano present the work at the 2010 Society of Biblical Literature Conference, Lynn Huber, Associate Professor of Religious Studies‚ÄîNew Testament and Early Christian History at Elon College commented, \\"As a biblical scholar I'm always a bit skeptical about dramatic interpretations of biblical texts, whether they will truly capture the complexity of the originals; however, Peterson's performances bring to light dimensions of the texts that many, even those of us who spend hours with the text on the page, fail to see. By bringing the stories and characters to life we're able to see the human-ness of the biblical narratives in all its gore and glory.\\" According to Teresa J Horsnby author of The Bible and American LGBT Interpretation, chapter 11 of the Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America \\"Peterson Toscano, a gay activist who stages and perform his biblical interpretations at universities and churches around the United States, focuses on narratives in which the primary actor could be read as 'other gendered.' In a performative series that depicts gendered others as the saviors of Israel, he tells the story of Hegai, Queen Esther's chief eunuch and his role in putting Esther in the position to save her people. Toscano also performs the narrative of an Ethiopian eunuch (Ebed Melech) who leads a \\"black op\\" unit to rescue the prophet Jeremiah from a cistern (Jer.38). One of Toscano's longest, and most provocative performance pieces, however, the story of Joseph, as told by his uncle Easu. Toscano tells the story in such a way that it is easy to imagine Joseph as a gay or possibly trans adolescent.\\" While he presents most of his Bible scholarship on stage or through his Transfigurations film, Toscano's writings about his Bible interpretations have appeared in the anthologies Gender Outlaws the Next Generation and Rainbow in the Word: LGBTQ Christian Memoirs. He also has contributed to REToday and Meetinghouse.xyz. His work is referenced in The Bible and the Transgender Experience and Retreating Forward: A Spiritual Practice with Transgender Persons. With artist Joey Hartman-Dow, Peterson published some of his Bible scholarship in the illustrated story, The Amazing Adventures of the Afterbirth of Jesus. Performance work Toscano performs original one-person comedies that often draw on his own experiences. In his plays he incorporates Biblical texts, historical events, interviews he has conducted, and poetry. Toscano's performance style incorporates character acting, comedy, storytelling, and drama. He has written about the tension in his work that comes from being an artist, activist, and scholar. He also has written about the influence Quakerism has had on his performance work. In February 2003, Toscano premiered his one-man satire Time in the Homo No Mo Halfway HouseSteve Boese: A Visit to the Homo No Mo Halfway House, Ex-Gay-Watch, 16. October 2003 in Memphis, TN and from that time until he retired it in February 2008, he performed it and spoke about the potential dangers of conversion therapy at venues throughout North America, in Sweden,Av Lars Klint: ‚ÄûJag √§r en stolt b√∂g‚Äú, Expressen, 24.

Bush, and Transfigurations‚ÄîTransgressing Gender in the Bible. In 2014 he shifted his focus and began to produce web content and performances that consider queer responses to climate change. He has presented at universities in North America including American University, Rice University, Haverford College, Colgate University, McGill University, University of British Columbia, Earlham College, University of Illinois, Bard College and James Madison University. In the UK he has presented at several universities including University of Cambridge, University of York, University of Bradford, Bishop Grosseteste University College and University of Southampton. He has been featured at many conferences including Society of Biblical Literature, Lambeth Conference (2008), Gender Odyssey, Coalition of Essential Schools Conference, California Transgender Leadership Summit, True Colors Conference, Women's History Conference at Sarah Lawrence College, Lavender Language Conference, Friends General Conference, and International Conference on Language, Literature and Identity at University of Yaounde, Cameroon. Activism In June 2005 the Queer Action Coalition invited Toscano to join them for a series of protests outside the Love in Action facility in Memphis, Tennessee. Zach Stark, a 16-year-old boy, was placed against his will into Refuge, Love in Action's program for youth. Before he entered, he sent out a MySpace bulletin alerting his friends that he will be forced to receive conversion therapy. The state of Tennessee launched a series of investigations, and the protests received international news coverage. In June 2007, Love in Action discontinued Refuge. In April 2007, together with Christine Bakke, Toscano launched Beyond Ex-Gay, an on-line support group for people who are now ex-ex-gay.Stephen Fried: ‚ÄûThey tried to cure me of being gay‚Äú, Glamour, 4/2007 Toscano also helped organize the Ex-Gay Survivor Conference held June 28 to July 1, 2007 in Irvine, California.Eugene Wagner: Ex-Gay Survivor Site Beyondexgay.com Launches Today, Conference Set for June, Ex-Gay-Watch, 2. April 2007 As part of the conference three former Exodus ex-gay leaders came forward to issue a public apology for their roles in promoting and providing conversion therapy.Michelle Garcia: A sincere apology, The Advocate, 29. June 2007 In response to a Memphis-area ex- gay conference organized by Colorado Springs-based Focus on the Family, in February 2008, Toscano along with Christine Bakke and other ex-ex-gays in the Mid-South and throughout the country organized a response called Deconstructing the Ex-Gay Myth‚ÄîA Weekend of Art and Action. Toscano shared some of his story in the local media and presented two of his plays. He also led workshops at an ex-gay survivor gathering. Toscano helped organize an international conference held in Catalonia on May 30, 2008 at the University of Barcelona. The conference, Ter√†pies reparatives per l'homosexualitat‚ÄîPerqu√® existeixen i quins perills impliquen (Gay to Straight Therapies‚ÄîThe reasons they exist and their potential harm) highlighted the potential dangers of conversion therapy and gave mental health professionals, scholars, clergy and concerned citizens the opportunity to hear from people directly affected by these therapies as well as experts in the field of psychology. As a grand marshal of the Mid-South Pride parade, Toscano returned to Memphis in June 2008, where he had been a resident of the Love in Action program 10 years earlier. In July 2008 Toscano presented his plays The Re-Education of George W. Bush and Transfigurations-Transgressing Gender in the Bible in Malta where he also spoke out about conversion therapy. He has served as an outspoken critic of the ex-gay movement in the UK. In August 2006 at the Greenbelt Festival he presented a talk about his own ex-gay experiences and personal journey.Pat Ashworth and Brian Draer: Greenbelt: Heavenly, but hardly ordinary, Church Times, 2006 In July 2008 he offered two talks at the Lambeth Conference in Kent where he discussed being \\"gay and Christian\\"Staff Writers: Lambeth participants invited to take a walk on the gay side, Ekklesia, 17 July 2008 and about the dangers of conversion therapy. In an article for the British newspaper The Times Toscano spoke of the ex-gay movement in Great Britain: It is a far more subtle seduction over here,' he says. Toscano claims that therapists in Britain ‚Äì who he says tried to exorcise his gay demons in Kidderminster, in the West Midlands ‚Äì nearly drove him to suicide.\\" In December 2008 Toscano traveled to South Africa and highlighted the potential dangers in receiving conversion therapy. He made his South African premiere on January7, 2009 in Cape Town. An active member of the Religious Society of Friends, Toscano states that his non-violent approach in his work seeks to expose injustice without attacking anti-gay activists. He believes that gay community needs to do more to accept LGBT people of faith, and by doing so will help to lessen the popularity of conversion therapy groups. He told news website Salon.com, \\"If we took better care of our own, we would put these programs out of business.\\" Climate work Beginning in September 2014,Peterson, Toscano. \\"Why on Earth Is This Gay Guy Marching for Climate?\\" The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post. Web. 14 December 2016. Toscano shifted his public focus to spreading awareness about climate change. Although not an environmentalist,\\"Bio.\\" Peterson Toscano. Peterson Toscano. Web. 27 January 2017. he was motivated to become a climate advocate because of his concerns about human rights and social justice. He has also joked that his Italian-American heritage has played a role too: \\"On a warmer planet where there's more drought, there will be more crop failure, including potentially, failures of wheat production, leading to shortages of pasta. I was like, wait, what?\\"Peach, Sara. \\"The end of pasta? Not funny!\\" Yale Climate Connections. The Yale Center for Environmental Communication, 30 September 2016. Web. 10 January 2017. Though Toscano has been presenting about climate change since September 2014, his realization of needing to take action - also known as his \\"apastalypse\\" \\\\- occurred in 2012. Toscano created five presentations address climate change: Everything Is Connected-A Collection Of Stories-Most Weird, Many True; Does This Apocalypse Make Me Look Fat?; A Queer Response To Climate Change; Climate Change: What's Faith Got To Do With It?; and There's Something Funny About Climate Change.\\"Performances.\\" Peterson Toscano.

Allegheny College. Web. 15 January 2017. He is known for his inspirational last words in performances: \\"During times of crisis, people do extraordinary things‚Ä¶ extraordinary, kind, loving, caring things. You see how communities come together to look after each other. How can we come up with lasting change that's not going to hurt communities, but actually foster a better world?\\" Since began addressing climate work starting in 2014, he has performed at various colleges and venues around North America and Europe, including the Greenbelt Festival, Penn State University,Jaramillo, Antonia. \\"Quirky, queer Quaker relates LGBTQA and religion issues to climate change.\\" The Daily Collegian.

In October 2017 Toscano presented A Queer Response to Climate Change‚ÄîWhat Would Walt Whitman Do? In an interview with NYU's Washington Square News, Toscano spoke about the role of comedy in taking on climate change and LGBTQ responses to climate change. \\"With climate change, we're all on the same boat together, but we're not all on the same deck. We know people have different experiences of the world. I think it's also important from a queer family values perspective that we're affected by climate change differently than other people. LGBTQ seniors, who are often more isolated than other seniors, may not have people checking in on them during a heat wave or hurricane. LGBTQ homeless youth, who may not feel welcome at shelters, need somewhere to go during big storms. We need to make sure we will survive these storms and that our people have healthy, strong lives.\\" Toscano has spoken at university sustainability events including the 2017 Southeastern EcoRep Conference and the New York Coalition for Sustainability in Higher Education. and at Citizens' Climate Lobby conferences, including the Mid-Atlantic regional conferenceClark, Jon. \\"Mid Atlantic conference a bonding experience for CCL chapters.\\" CCL News.

Carmela tells Tony that A.J. asked his guidance counselor which colleges would be suitable for studying event planning. They find some solace in the fact that A.J. is at least \\"fired up about something.\\" Christopher disposes of Adriana's last remaining possessions. Carmela phones looking for her, and Chris says that they broke up and she left town. Tony asks him whether he said anything to Adriana about Matthew Bevilaqua or Ralphie Cifaretto that she could have repeated to the FBI. Chris says he did not, and assures Tony that he is staying sober and exercising. Phil reclaims his brother Billy's body from the morgue, and demands that Johnny retaliate against the New Jersey mob. Ray Curto, who continues to provide information to the FBI, has a birthday dinner, unaware that Adriana has been killed for herself being an informant. Those present at the dinner are restive at Tony's continued protection of his cousin, Tony B. With Phil seeking revenge, they are all in danger. Tony delivers a speech: he explains that he is saving Tony B from torture; he would do the same for them; they must unite as a family. Phil tries to track down Chris as an alternative target of his revenge, noting his closeness to Tony. He threatens Chris's mother. Chris then goes into hiding with the help of Benny, but Phil finds Benny and beats him up, fracturing his skull. Tony goes to Junior for advice, but he cannot help, distracted by dementia. At a consultation, Dr. Melfi reminds Tony that his concern for Tony B comes primarily from his feelings of guilt. Silvio tells Tony of the growing discontent in the family and asserts he is shielding Tony B out of pride, which Tony angrily rejects. Tony visits Paulie, having heard he is among those dissatisfied with his leadership. In Paulie's living room, he discovers the portrait of himself with his horse Pie-O-My, which he had wanted destroyed after the horse's death. Unbeknownst to him, Paulie had kept the painting and had it altered, changing Tony's clothes to those of a colonial general. When Tony demands to know why he had him painted as a \\"lawn jockey,\\" Paulie says that he did it out of sincere admiration for Tony as a leader. Tony pauses, but then rips the painting off the wall and puts it in a dumpster. Tony B is hiding out at Uncle Pat's vacated Kinderhook, New York farmhouse. He is returning with some shopping; Tony appears round a corner with a pump-action shotgun and kills him. Tony then tells Phil and Johnny where Tony B can be found. Phil arrives expecting to exact his revenge, but only finds the body. Johnny tells Tony that Tony B's death \\"didn't solve a thing.\\" Tony meets Johnny at his New Jersey house, and offers a percentage of Tony B's Bloomfield Avenue casino as a peace offering to Phil. At the moment the feud is settled, Tony looks over Johnny's shoulder and sees armed men approaching. They both run away. It is the FBI, who arrest Johnny. Tony throws his handgun into the snow and navigates the neighborhood to avoid the Feds. A few hours later, he calls his lawyer, Neil Mink, who informs him that Johnny was betrayed by Jimmy Petrille, his consigliere. Tony was not mentioned in the indictment. Tony arrives home bedraggled; Carmela exclaims, \\"What happened to you? Your shoes are soaking wet!\\" Deceased * Tony Blundetto: Shot in the head with a 12 gauge shotgun by Tony Soprano in order to make peace with the Lupertazzi crime family and to save Tony B from a more painful death at the hands of Phil Leotardo. Title reference * Vito prefaces his criticism with \\"All due respect\\" when discussing the family's problems with New York with the other captains. * Silvio does the same before criticizing Tony for having too much pride. The phrase is generally used before someone of equal or higher status is told something they don't want to hear. When answering Silvio, Tony repeats the phrase with ironic politeness. * It could describe: Tony's striving to gain Johnny's respect; Johnny's striving to gain Tony's respect; and Tony's striving to keep the respect of his family. Production * This is the final episode directed by John Patterson, who died in 2005. Patterson directed all the season finales for the first five seasons. * At the end of the episode, Tony's emergence from the rustling bushes reaffirms the use of the bear as a symbol for Tony's dominating presence in his house. Based on the emerging location of the bear in earlier episodes, there is uncertainty as to the identity of the rustling figure. * Bob Shaw, the production designer for the show, makes a cameo appearance as Ignatz Pravalkis, the architect working with Hugh De Angelis to create Carmela's spec house. * Drea de Matteo reveals in the DVD commentary for the previous episode, \\"Long Term Parking,\\" that the character of Tony Blundetto was not initially supposed to die in the fifth- season finale. * The scene in which Johnny Sack is arrested is shown again in the sixth-season episode \\"Soprano Home Movies,\\" but a different take is used.

Music * The song played over the end credits is \\"Glad Tidings\\" by Van Morrison. It is also played earlier when Christopher talks to Silvio at a Roy Rogers, and later during a scene where Tony B arrives at Uncle Pat's farm, shortly before his murder. A The Star-Ledger review of this episode explains the song's importance to the plot: \\"The episode's use of Van Morrison's \\"Glad Tidings\\" as a recurring motif was a classic example of the show's attention to detail. Moments before buckshot hits Blundetto, we heard the verse that opened with \\"And we'll send you glad tidings from New York\\" and closed with \\"Hope that you will come in right on time.\\" * In the scene wherein Tony is sitting on the steps of an elementary school, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is heard being sung by a children's choir. * \\"Smoke N' Mirrors\\" by Grade 8 plays when Benny tries to leave after he saw Phil walk into the Crazy Horse.

It is situated on the Vilcanota River. Pisac is most known for its Incan ruins and large market every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, an event which attracts heavy tourist traffic from nearby Cusco. Notable Features Pisac is perhaps best known for its Incan ruins, known as Inca P√≠sac, which lie atop a hill at the entrance to the valley. The ruins are separated along the ridge into four groups: P'isaqa, Inti Watana, Qalla Q'asa, and Kinchiraqay. Inti Watana group includes the Temple of the Sun, baths, altars, water fountains, a ceremonial platform, and an inti watana, a volcanic outcrop carved into a \\"hitching post for the Sun\\" (or Inti). The angles of its base suggest that it served to define the changes of the seasons.Elorrieta Salazar, Fernando E. & Elorrieta Salazar, Edgar (2005) Cusco and the Sacred Valley of the Incas, pages 69-75, Qalla Q'asa, which is built onto a natural spur and overlooks the valley, is known as the citadel. The Inca constructed agricultural terraces on the steep hillside, which are still in use today. They created the terraces by hauling richer topsoil by hand from the lower lands. The terraces enabled the production of surplus food, more than would normally be possible at altitudes as high as 11,000 feet.Readers Digest: \\"Mysteries of the Ancient Americas: The New World before Columbus\\" With military, religious, and agricultural structures, the site served at least a triple purpose. Researchers believe that P√≠sac defended the southern entrance to the Sacred Valley, while Choquequirao defended the western entrance, and the fortress at Ollantaytambo the northern.Inca Pisac controlled a route which connected the Inca Empire with the border of the rain forest. The sanctuary of Huanca (Quechua: wanka, 'sacred stone'), site of a sacred shrine, is also near the village. Pilgrims travel to the shrine every September. One of its more notable features was a large pisonay tree, which dominated the central plaza (it was destroyed by a 2013 thunderstorm). History According to the scholar Kim MacQuarrie, Pachacuti erected a number of royal estates to memorialize victories over other ethnic groups. Among these royal estates are P√≠sac (victory over the Cuyos), Ollantaytambo (victory over the Tambos), and Machu Picchu (conquest of the Vilcabamba Valley). Other historians suggest that P√≠sac was established to protect Cusco from possible attacks of the Ash√°ninka nations. It is unknown when Inca P√≠sac was built. Since it does not appear to have been inhabited by any pre-Inca civilization, it was most likely built no earlier than 1440. Francisco Pizarro and the Spanish conquerors destroyed Inca P√≠sac in the early 1530s. The modern town of P√≠sac was built in the valley by Viceroy Toledo during the 1570s.

For example, public parks in desert areas of the United States may contain ramadas with picnic tables, restrooms, water sources, etc. Since sunlight is more of an environmental hazard than wind or snow or rain in this part of the world, a roof alone provides substantial shelter. And because there are no walls in the structure, airflow is unrestricted, helping to keep the temperature below the roof substantially cooler than ambient. An example of a large modern-day ramada can be seen at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in Arizona, where it is used to protect ancient ruins.

The monastery arose at the site of a former Celtic temple, dedicated to the Gallo-Roman goddess Epona. In 898 the Carolingian emperor Arnulf granted the Gurk valley to his son Zwentibold, one of Saint Hemma's ancestors. A widow since the killing of her husband William, margrave on the Sann in 1036, she founded a convent of noble ladies on the Gurk manor, apparently without implying a strict order rule. She had a church erected, dedicated to Saint Mary, which was consecrated on 15 August 1043. Her endowment comprised extended estates in the Duchy of Carinthia and its Styrian and Carniolan marches. She also ceded large properties in the Enns valley to the Salzburg archbishop, the basis for the foundation of Admont Abbey in 1074. Saint Hemma possibly joined the Gurk convent herself. She died about two years later and was buried in the monastery church. The nunnery was dissolved in 1070 by Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg, who used the assets so realised to establish the suffragan Diocese of Gurk centered at Gurk Cathedral. Hemma's mortal remains were transferred to the newly erected cathedral in 1174; the former abbey church decayed and was finally demolished in the 19th century.

Its chapters were originally articles published between 1974 and 1979 in various magazines, including The Atlantic Monthly, The New Republic, Physics Today, Playboy, and Scientific American. In the introduction, Sagan wrote: Title The title essay is named in honor of the French physician, anatomist and anthropologist, Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880). He is best known for his discovery that different functions are assigned to different parts of the brain. He believed that by studying the brains of cadavers and correlating the known experiences of the former owners of the organs, human behavior could eventually be discovered and understood. To that end, he saved hundreds of human brains in jars of formalin; among the collection is his own brain. When Sagan finds it in the Mus√©e de l'Homme, he poses questions that challenge some core ideas of human existence such as \\"How much of that man known as Paul Broca can still be found in this jar?\\"‚Äîa question that evokes both religious and scientific argument. Contents A major part of the book is devoted to debunking \\"paradoxers\\" who either live at the edge of science or are outright charlatans. An example of this is the controversy surrounding Immanuel Velikovsky's ideas presented in the book Worlds in Collision. Another large part of the book discusses naming conventions for the members of our solar system and their physical features. Sagan also discusses Science fiction at some length. Here, he mentions Robert A. Heinlein as being one of his favorite science fiction authors in his childhood. Near death experiences and their cultural ambiguity is another topic of the essays. Sagan also criticizes ideas developed in Robert K. G. Temple's book The Sirius Mystery, published three years earlier in 1975. In the final section of the book, \\"Ultimate Questions,\\" Sagan writes: Reception Kirkus Reviews stated that, as an essayist, Sagan was \\"no Bronowski,\\" and overall judged the collection to be \\"a mixed, often surprising bag of treats.\\"BROCA'S BRAIN: Reflections on the romance of science, reviewed at Kirkus Reviews; published May 1, 1979; archived online ??; retrieved April 7, 2020 People considered that‚Äîaside from the \\"strangely touching\\" chapter about Broca's preserved brain‚Äîthe book as a whole \\"rambles,\\" with \\"plenty of science ... but little romance.\\"Picks and Pans Review: Broca's Brain, in People; published June 18, 1979; retrieved April 7, 2020 References Category:1979 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Random House books Category:Science books Category:Scientific skepticism mass media Category:Works by Carl Sagan Category:Books about Dogon religion ","title":"Broca's Brain"},{"id":"4472734","text":"Brian \\"Ginger\\" Gillen (born 1956/1957)Gillen age given as 58 as of 8 September 2015, irishtimes.com; accessed 24 September 2015. was alleged to be a volunteer in the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and, later, named to the IRA Army Council.Guardian articleSinn Fein leaders ordered to court , scotsman.com; accessed 24 September 2015.

The report maintained that because of Yale's primary object of graduating well-educated and well-rounded men, it should continue to require all of its students to follow a single thorough curriculum, with Latin and Greek literature at its core. Before the release of the report, there was a gradual movement toward a more open, elective course of study at colleges around the United States. The report was in part a response to the criticism of Latin and Greek as \\"dead languages\\". According to the Yale Daily News, the report was released \\"as the University's reputation was at its zenith\\", when \\"the eyes of the nation's academic community focused on New Haven\\".\\"Past guides review committee: After 1828's conservatism and 1953's failed coup, 2003 finds moderation\\", Yale Daily News, 2003-11-17 The highly-influential report, which reformers have complained set back curricular reforms by decades, tipped the balance at universities across the United States, including at Princeton and Harvard, toward a conservative approach to higher education. The report was issued in two parts. Part I presents the plan for education at Yale and defends the classical curriculum and Part II specifically considers the importance of the classical languages to the curriculum. History The report was issued after a September 11, 1827, resolution of Yale's President and Fellows ordered a faculty committee \\"to inquire into the expediency of so altering the regular course of instruction in this college, as to leave out of said course the study of the dead languages, substituting other studies therefor; and either requiring a competent knowledge of said languages, as a condition of admittance into the college, or providing instruction in the same, for such as shall choose to study them after admittance.\\" The faculty signed its report with September 9, 1828, as its date. A prescribed curriculum The report acknowledges that changes to the curriculum \\"may, from time to time be made with advantage, to meet the varying demands of the community, to accommodate the course of instruction to the rapid advance of the country, in population, refinement, and opulence\\", but argued for a prescribed set of courses that all students should meet: :The two great points to be gained in intellectual culture, are the discipline and the furniture of the mind; expanding its powers, and storing it with knowledge. The former of these is, perhaps, the more important of the two. A commanding object, therefore, in a collegiate course, should be, to call into daily and vigorous exercise the faculties of the student. Those branches of study should be prescribed, and those modes of instruction adopted, which are best calculated to teach the art of fixing the attention, directing the train of thought, analyzing a subject proposed for investigation; following, with accurate discrimination, the course of argument; balancing nicely the evidence presented to the judgment; awakening, elevating, and controlling the imagination; arranging, with skill, the treasures which memory gathers; rousing and guiding the powers of genius. All this is not to be effected by a light and hasty course of study; by reading a few books, hearing a few lectures, and spending some months at a literary institution. By endorsing a prescribed course of study, the Yale faculty denounced the concept of preparing its undergraduates for specific professional work. \\"Our object is not to teach that which is peculiar to any one of the professions; but to lay the foundation which is common to them all.\\" Latin and Greek Part II of the report argued that beyond the requisites of the liberal arts and sciences, knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin was the foundation for a liberal education. It states that :the study of the classics is useful, not only as it lays the foundations of a correct taste, and furnishes the student with those elementary ideas which are found in the literature of modern times, and which he no where so well acquires as in their original sources,‚Äîbut also as the study itself forms the most effectual discipline of the mental faculties. However, the report conceded that not all students were satisfied with the curriculum, and suggested the possibility of a plan \\"to confer degrees on those only who have finished the present established course,‚Äîbut to allow other students, who do not aim at the honors of the college, to attend on the instruction of the classes as far as they shall choose.\\" Despite this concession, the faculty committee's report strongly praised \\"the course which has hitherto been pursued\\", and, in fact, aimed to strive to make the curriculum even more focused on classical studies. It proposed that \\"the terms of admission may very properly, be gradually raised so as ultimately to render necessary, as a condition of admission, much greater acquirements, especially in the classics, than the laws of the college at present prescribe.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Scan of the Yale Report of 1828 (PDF) * Full text of the Yale Report (online): Part I Part II * Full text of the Yale Report in HTML, PDF, DocX, and Markdown formats * Short essay on the Yale Report Category:Yale University Category:1828 documents Category:History of education in the United States ","title":"Yale Report of 1828"},{"id":"4472780","text":"Robert S. \\"Bob\\" Van Dillen (born October 6, 1972), occasionally known as Bobby Van Dillen, is an American meteorologist currently working on the Morning Express with Robin Meade show on HLN.

The morning Kansas City Times, under ownership of afternoon The Kansas City Star, won two Pulitzer Prizes and was bigger than its parent when its name was changed to The Star. History John C. Moore and John Newman Edwards founded The Times in 1867 to support the Democratic Party's anti-Reconstruction policies. Edwards had been adjutant of Confederate general Joseph O. Shelby's division during the Civil War and claimed to have had more horses shot out from under him than anyone else in Shelby's division. Moore was a colonel under Shelby, and before that chief of staff to General John S. Marmaduke, judge adjutant general, and second in the Marmaduke-Walker duel. The Kansas City Star ownership 1901‚Äì1977 William Rockhill Nelson bought The Times on October 19, 1901, mainly because he wanted The Times' Associated Press wire. Nelson then applied a subheading to the newspaper The Morning Kansas City Star and proclaimed that The Kansas City Star empire was a 24-hour-a-day newspaper. In accordance with Nelson's will, employees took over the newspaper in 1926 upon the death of Nelson's daughter. Last edition of The Kansas City Times on February 28th, 1990 Capital Cities ownership 1977‚Äì1990 The Star and Times were locally owned by employees until 1977, when they were sold to Capital Cities. Under the corporate ownership, The Times had higher circulation than its evening brother. Capital Cities made attempts to make the newsrooms appear to compete (even though Kansas City did not have competing dailies since The Kansas City Journal folded in 1942). The Times won its only Pulitzer Prizes in 1982. Rick Atkinson won an award for\\"National Reporting\\". The Times shared an award with The Star for \\"Local General or Spot New Reporting\\" for its coverage of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. Demographics across the country showed throughout the 1980s that morning newspapers were consistently stronger than afternoon papers. On March 1, 1990, The Star (which was then under ownership of Capital Cities/ABC) applied its name to the morning paper and The Times name disappeared, and Kansas City no longer had an afternoon daily.

Most traditional versions of this bread are made with a combination of white flour with whole wheat flour and/or rye flour, water, leavening and salt. For centuries, French villages had communal ovens where the townsfolk would bring their dough to be baked, and the loaves weighed from four to as much as twelve pounds (1.5‚Äì5.5 kg). Such large loaves would feed a family for days or weeks, until the next baking day. Before the advent of roller milling, virtually all wheat was milled by stone grinding. In order to produce a lighter, less chewy bread, the whole wheat flour was sifted or bolted using mesh or cloth. This resulted in a whiter flour that still retained some of the bran and germ. The addition of rye flour in some recipes probably originates from the presence of rye growing among the wheat. All the grain was harvested together, and as much as 10 percent of it would be rye. Rye flour ferments more quickly than wheat flour, and it imparts a distinctive flavor to traditional pains de campagne. With the rise of commercial yeast at the turn of the 20th century, pain de campagne fell out of favor in French cities, where it was replaced by the baguette.Wood, Ed. World Sourdoughs from Antiquity. Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1996 However, with the rise of artisan breads in the 1970s,David, Elizabeth, English Bread and Yeast Cookery. Middlesex:Penguin, 1977 pain de campagne has been growing in popularity, both in Europe and the US. Today pain de campagne is still made in France, and is enjoying a growing appreciation in the United States and the UK. When made traditionally, the dough is allowed to ferment for several hours, allowing the yeasts to grow and develop the flavors. The dough is then rounded and placed in linen-lined baskets called \\"bannetons\\". After the dough has risen, it is dumped out of the basket and onto peel, and slid into the oven where it bakes at around 240 ¬∞C (450 ¬∞F) for about one hour.

Founded in 1898, it is the oldest of six recognized secret honor societies that participate in the annual tradition of Tap Day on campus.The Maneater - Tap Day reveals society inductees The winged sphere is the primary symbol of the QEBH Society. History The society was founded in November 1898 by eight men. They were Royall Hill Switzler, Thomas Benton Marbut, Gurry Ellsworth Huggins, William Frank Wilson, Clarence Martin Jackson, Horace Beckley Williams, Antoine Edward Russell, and Galius Lawton Zwick. Royall Hill Switzler organized the first class of the society, and he is therefore credited as being the founder of QEBH.Handy Williamson, Vice Provost, Receives Double Tap QEBH's workings, purposes, and affairs are known only to its members. Throughout its history, QEBH has maintained a rivalry with MU's Mystical Seven society. This rivalry has often involved the two societies playing pranks on each other. In one instance in 1985, members of QEBH disguised themselves as members of Mystical Seven and surprised Mystical Seven's yet-to-be-initiated candidates at 4:30am one morning. The new candidates were convinced the activity was part of their initiation process, and they were taken to Jefferson City, Missouri where they were dropped off and abandoned by the disguised QEBH members.\\"Five Honor Societies Initiate New Members\\". Columbia Missourian. April 18, 1985. Symbolism The primary symbol of QEBH is the winged sphere. The symbol's origin is that of the winged sphere that was once the distinctive mark of Jesse Hall. The wings broke from the top of the dome when a patriotic student scaled the dome one night around the time of World War I and fastened the staff of a large American flag to the structure. The flag caught enough wind to tear the wings from the dome, leaving only the golden sphere, which is still in place. The destruction of the wings from the dome was foreshadowed in the 1901 Savitar where mention is made of QEBH's secret meetings at the top of the dome, but it was later stated that \\"QEBH didn't take the wings off the dome.\\"http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/t/text/gifcvtdir/sav1901/sav1901p126.jpg Victory Bell The tradition of the Victory Bell originated in 1927. The bell was originally stolen from a church in Seward, Nebraska by Phi Delta Theta and Delta Tau Delta in 1892. The two fraternities shared housing at the time, but when the groups later acquired their own individual houses they began an annual tradition of awarding the bell as a trophy to the winner of a specified athletic or academic contest. When then Missouri athletic director Chester Brewer suggested a trophy be established for the winner of the annual Missouri‚ÄìNebraska Rivalry football game, the bell was chosen to fill the role. An \\"M\\" was then engraved on one side of the bell and an \\"N\\" was engraved on the opposite side. QEBH is the caretaker of the bell at Missouri, and the Innocents Society is the caretaker of the bell at Nebraska. Due to conference realignment, there has been a hiatus of the Missouri-Nebraska rivalry since 2010.Innocents: Members University of Missouri, Official Athletic Site of the Mizzou Tigers Traditions Early chapters 300px Tap Day 2006 Chapter of 1898 *Royall Hill Switzler (Œ¶ŒîŒò, Œ¶ŒíŒö) *Thomas Benton Marbut *Antoine Edward Russell (ŒíŒòŒ†, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *William Frank Wilson (KA, ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *Clarence Martin Jackson (Œ¶ŒíŒö, Œ£Œû) *Gurry Ellsworth Huggins *Horace Beckley Williams (Œ¶ŒîŒò, MU Football) *Galius Lawton Zwick (Œ£ŒëŒï, ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶, MU Baseball) Chapter of 1899 *George Harrison English (Œ¶ŒîŒò, ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *Raymond Saufley Edmonds (Œ¶ŒîŒò, ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *George Gordon Robertson (MU Tennis) *Irvin Victor Barth (ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒíŒö, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *Don Carlos Guffey (ŒöŒ£) *Libsom Elwood Durham *Joe Shelby McIntyre (ŒòŒùŒï, Œ¶ŒîŒ¶) *Frank Young Gladney *Richmond Laurin Hawkins (MU Baseball) *Merritt Kimbrough Salmon (Œ£ŒëŒï) Chapter of 1900 *John Louis Deister (Œ¶ŒíŒö) *Elmer C.

Applications that run on multiple computer architectures are called machine- independent, or cross-platform.Agrawala, & Rauscher (2014) Many organisations opt for such software because they believe that machine-dependent software is an asset and will attract more buyers. Organizations that want application software to work on heterogeneous computers may port that software to the other machines. Deploying machine-dependent applications on such architectures, such applications require porting. This procedure includes composing, or re-composing, the application's code to suit the target platform.  Porting  Porting is the process of converting an application from one architecture to another.Rashid, Patnaik, & Bhattacherjee, 2014 Software languages such as Java are designed so that applications can migrate across architectures without source code modifications. The term is applied when programming/equipment is changed to make it usable in a different architecture. Code that does not operate properly on a specific system must be ported to another system. Porting effort depends upon a few variables, including the degree to which the first environment (the source stage) varies from the new environment (the objective stage) and the experience of the creators in knowing platform-specific programming dialects.Huang, Li, & Xie, 2015 Many languages offer a machine independent intermediate code that can be processed by platform-specific interpreters to address incompatibilities.Yin, et al., 2012 The transitional representation characterises a virtual machine that can execute all modules written in the intermediate dialect. The intermediate code guidelines are interpreted into distinct machine code arrangements by a code generator to make executable code. The intermediate code may also be executed directly without static conversion into platform- specific code.Mathur, Miles, & Du, 2015  Approaches  * Port the translator. This can be coded in portable code. * Adapt the source code to the new machine. * Execute the adjusted source utilizing the translator with the code generator source as data. This will produce the machine code for the code generator.  Application software  Some application software is restricted to certain platforms.Lee, Yu, & Lee, 2013 Those who want an application to work on a non-native computer, port the app to a new platform.

Biography He was born in Arabie at the time belonging to Corsier-sur-Vevey, today a part of Vevey. He was the son of a skillful marble worker in Vevey, but because his father lost the family fortune, Calame could not concentrate on art, but rather he was forced to work in a bank from the age of 15. When his father fell from a building and then died, it was up to the young Calame to provide for his mother. Swiss Landscape (1830) In his spare time he began to practice drawing small views of Switzerland. In 1829 he met his patron, the banker Diodati, who made it possible for him to study under landscape painter Fran√ßois Diday. After a few months he decided to devote himself fully to art. In 1835 he began exhibiting his Swiss-Alps and forest paintings in Paris and Berlin. He became quite well known, especially in Germany, although Calame was more a drawer than an illustrator. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. In 1842 he went to Paris and displayed his works Mont Blanc, the Jungfrau, the Brienzersee, the Monte Rosa and Mont Cervin. He taught in Geneva, where Adolf Mosengel was one of his pupils. He went to Italy in 1844 and brought back from Rome and Naples countless paintings, among them one of the ruins of Paestum (in the city museum in Leipzig). He showed that he was capable of understanding Italian nature; but the Alps remained his speciality. National Museum, Warsaw Alpine Mountain Scene, Widener University Art Museum Alfred O. Deshong Collection The glaciers, emerald-green, white foaming mountain water, which split the trees during the storm, and the whipped clouds, the multi-colored rocks, half masked from fog, in the rays of the gleaming sun, are those things, which he knew to be true to nature. We still call them the Handeckfall from Bernese upper country, in Tirol, Lake Lucerne, the forest tower (in the urban museum of Leipzig), the forest stream (Dresdener gallery) etc. One of his most ingenious works is the representation of the four seasons and times of the day in four landscapes, a spring morning in the south, a summer midday in the Nordic flatlands, an Autumn evening, and a winter night on a mountain. He became popular with these large works, and his popularity grew with smaller pieces and lithographies, namely 18 studies of Lauterbrunnen and Meiringen and the 24 sheets of Alpine passes. These were widespread in France, England, and Germany and are still today used to teach this style of painting. Calame became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1850, he resigned the next year. He died in Menton, France in 1864. An exhibition featuring more than thirty of Calame's paintings was held at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 2006.

It is also used in geodesy. Traverse networks involve placing survey stations along a line or path of travel, and then using the previously surveyed points as a base for observing the next point. Traverse networks have many advantages, including: * Less reconnaissance and organization needed; * While in other systems, which may require the survey to be performed along a rigid polygon shape, the traverse can change to any shape and thus can accommodate a great deal of different terrains; * Only a few observations need to be taken at each station, whereas in other survey networks a great deal of angular and linear observations need to be made and considered; * Traverse networks are free of the strength of figure considerations that happen in triangular systems; * Scale error does not add up as the traverse is performed. Azimuth swing errors can also be reduced by increasing the distance between stations. The traverse is more accurate than triangulaterationChrzanowski and Konecny, (1965); Adler and Schmutter (1971). (a combined function of the triangulation and trilateration practice).Schofield, Wilfred (2001). Engineering Surveying.Butterworth-Heinemann. . Types Frequently in surveying engineering and geodetic science, control points (CP) are setting/observing distance and direction (bearings, angles, azimuths, and elevation). The CP throughout the control network may consist of monuments, benchmarks, vertical control, etc. There are mainly two types of traverse: * Closed traverse: either originates from a station and returns to the same station completing a circuit, or runs between two known stations * Open traverse: neither returns to its starting station, nor closes on any other known station. Diagram of an open traverse Diagram of a closed traverse Compound A compound traverse is where an open traverse is linked at its ends to an existing traverse to form a closed traverse. The closing line may be defined by coordinates at the end points which have been determined by previous survey. The difficulty is, where there is linear misclosure, it is not known whether the error is in the new survey or the previous survey.

In 1956 he came to Hamburg and was employed as a harbour worker at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft. A serious traffic accident in 1956 smashed his nose and gave him a pronounced squint. In 1957 he married Inge and had a son called Fritz, but the marriage failed and they separated in 1960. Neighbours recall violent scenes in their flat. The couple reconciled, but separated a second time in 1967. He moved to the Hamburg neighborhood of Ottensen in 1967. In 1972 he lived together with Irmgard Albrecht for a while. On 15 August 1972 he attempted to force Ruth Dufner to have sex with him and Irmgard. Dufner fled unclothed from Honka's flat and reported him to the police. She received treatment in hospital. At the time of the incident, Honka had a very high blood alcohol level. On 4 April 1975 a court ordered him to pay a fine of 4500 DM, but a charge of rape was dropped. In the years afterwards, his problems with alcohol prevented him from maintaining relationships with women, and he turned to prostitutes he met in pubs or around the Reeperbahn for sex. Murders The apartment house in Ottensen, Hamburg where Honka lived In December 1970 Honka, then a night watchman for Shell, committed his first proven murder. He strangled Gertraud Br√§uer, a 42-year-old hairdresser and occasional prostitute, in his flat. Honka said that she would not have sex with him. Honka sawed the corpse into pieces that he then wrapped up and hid in various places in the nearby area. The body parts were found and identified by Hamburg police, but their investigation did not find the murderer. Honka murdered again, four years later, when he strangled the 54-year-old prostitute Anna Beuschel in his flat in August 1974. He claimed that she had not been passionate enough when they had sex. In December 1974 he killed the 57-year- old Frieda Roblick in the same way and in January 1975 he murdered the 52-year-old prostitute Ruth Schult. In all three cases Honka cut the corpses into small pieces and hid them in his flat and in the house's attic. The disappearance of the three women was not reported to the police. Complaints of other people living in the house regarding the stench of rotting flesh were disregarded. Honka used large numbers of pine-scented perfume blocks in an attempt to mask the odour. Motives and personality Fritz Honka was tall, and of slight build. He had a squint and a speech impediment. Both of his marriages failed due to heavy alcohol consumption. When very drunk he would vent his aggression on women, usually shorter than him and often toothless, to alleviate his fears of mutilation during oral sex. Discovery and trial On 15 July 1975 the apartment building where Honka lived caught fire. Firemen tackling the blaze discovered a partially decomposed female torso in a plastic bag which prompted the police to search the flat. Honka was at work at the time and was arrested when he returned home. On 29 July Fritz Honka confessed to murdering the women. He withdrew his confession in November 1976, claiming not to remember anything. In custody, Honka said he killed the women after they mocked his preference for oral sex over \\"straight\\" intercourse. The court found him guilty on one count of murder and three counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital. His habitual abuse of alcohol was considered a mitigating factor, as it diminished his mental capacity. Final years Honka was released from prison in 1993 and spent his last years in a nursing home under the name of Peter Jensen. He died in a hospital in Langenhorn, Hamburg on 19 October 1998.  Legacy  In 1975, German musician Karl-Heinz Blumenberg recorded the black humor single Gern hab ich die Frau‚Äôn ges√§gt (‚ÄúI loved to saw the women‚Äù, a titular reference to the 1920s Schlager Gern hab ich die Frau‚Äôn gek√º√üt, ‚ÄúI loved to kiss the women‚Äù, sung by Richard Tauber) under the pseudonym of Harry Horror, in reference to Honka. The song quickly became an underground hit in Hamburg clubs, but Blumenberg's record company RCA Records refused to officially release it due to its controversial theme. German writer Heinz Strunk‚Äôs novel Der goldene Handschuh (‚ÄúThe Golden Glove‚Äù) was published in 2016, winning the Wilhelm Raabe Literature Prize and nominated for the Leipzig Book Fair Prize. It tells the story of Fritz Honka and bears the name of one of the St Pauli bars in which Honka met his victims. German director Fatih Akin acquired the rights to Strunk's novel and made a movie adaptation. The eponymous film was released in 2019. Fritz Honka is played by Jonas Dassler in Der goldene Handschuh. In July of 2020 the german band Ost+Front released the song Honka Honka, whose lyrics also reference Strunk's novel as well as the names of each of the victims.

The college was founded in 1872 and it was the first private college in India which was purely an Indian-run institution. It was formerly known as Metropolitan Institution. It was named after its founder Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 1917. History A 1998 stamp dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Vidyasagar College Vidyasagar College was founded in the year 1872. About the college The college had its origin in the Calcutta Training School that was founded by Thakurdas Chakraborty in 1859. In 1864, the school came to be known as the Metropolitan Institution. In 1872, the University of Calcutta granted affiliation to the Institution for the First Arts (FA) standard. The birth of the first private and truly secular college in the Presidency of Bengal was hailed as a landmark in the academic and cultural ethos of India. It was the great Indian educationalist and social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who was associated with the College from its very inception in 1872. The college is a living monument of the untiring labours of Vidyasagar who is known to be the founder of the college. After the passing away of the founder in 1891, the name, Metropolitan Institute, was changed to Vidyasagar College in 1917. Saradaranjan Ray, who taught Sanskrit and Mathematics, was a professor and principal of the college. His third brother, Muktidaranjan Ray, who taught Mathematics, was also a professor of this college. The 143 years voyage commenced with only 5 departments i.e. Sanskrit, English, Philosophy, Economics, History (General). Since 1917 the College entered a phase of rapid growth which made it expand its academic curriculum by introducing a commerce department in 1922 and a morning section for women in 1931. Some of its famous alumni include Swami Vivekananda, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray, Keshub Chandra Sen, Acharya Jadunath Sarkar, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jagjivan Ram and many others who made immense contribution in various walks of life. The institution also had the services of such great luminaries as Surendranath Banerjee, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Professor Sisir Kumar Bhaduri, Nabin Chandra Vidyaratna and even Rabindranath Tagore in various capacities. The Commerce Department of the college, established in 1922, has the distinction of being the oldest commerce teaching department in India. It had its affiliation up to B.Com. standard in 1928 and attracted students from different parts of India. It was due to the untiring effort of Prof. J.C. Mitra, the then Vice-Principal of the College the Commerce Department made rapid growth in terms of faculty and student strength that a separate wing had to be devoted to commerce teaching. Campuses The college has several campuses in Kolkata. The main campus is situated at the 39 Sankar Ghose Lane in College Street. The Bidhannagar Campus at the Salt lake Sector II is specialized for post-graduate courses. The college has its third campus in Bidhan Sarani Road.vidyasagarcollege.edu.in/campus NAAC Accreditation The college war accredited a \\"B\\" grade on the basis of CGPA 2.63, under a four point scale by tht National Assessment and Accreditation Council.http://218.248.45.211/naac_EC/ShowPdf.aspx?Field1=College&Field2;=Vidyasagar+College&Field3;=Kolkata&Field4;=WB&Field5;=Cycle1&Field6;=13760 In cycle 2 accreditation of 2016, the college was re-accredited a \\"B++\\" grade on thr basis of CGPA 2.80. http://218.248.45.211/naac_EC/ShowPdf.aspx?Field1=College&Field2;=Vidyasagar+College&Field3;=Kolkata&Field4;=WB&Field5;=Cycle2&Field6;=13760  Controversy = Attacks by the Bharatiya Janata Party  A scuffle broke out between student activists from the All India Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Stone pelting incidents have been reported near a college hostel on Bidhan Sarani Street in Kolkata during Amit Shah's Road show on May 2019. BJP workers and supporters shouted \\"Jai Shri Ram\\" and \\"Narendra Modi Zindabad\\" during the road show. BJP activists locked the doors of the hostel and set up bicycles and motorbikes parked outside on fire. Local news organisation Anandabazar Patrika‚Äôs ground report shows stones being hurled inside the premises by people standing outside on the road, wearing saffron coloured ‚ÄúNaMo Again‚Äù t-shirts. The footage does not show anyone hrowing stones from inside the campus.

It is a relatively new process invented in the US during the 1930s by Hubert Mesibov, Michael J. Gallagher, and Dox Thrash, an artist working in Philadelphia with the WPA). \\"Carborundum Collagraph\\" collagraph is a different printmaking technique, invented in 1952 by Henri Goetz, an American abstract artist living in Paris. The carborundum mezzotint uses the grits to create pits below the surface of the metal that then hold ink, like traditional mezzotint. The carborundum collagraph creates the image above the surface of the matrix, which does not have to be metal. In one method, the grits are mixed into a paste using an acrylic base that is painted onto the matrix, creating the image much like painting. Once dried, this holds the ink; the wiping and printing are done the same as etching. The techniques described following and below are alternatives to the paste mixture technique, yet all are creating the image above the surface of the matrix. Carbordundum collagraph allows artists to work on a large scale. Normally, cardboard or wood plates are coated in a layer of carborundum or screen, and the lights are created by filling in the texture with screen filler or glue. Carborundum prints may be printed as intaglio plates. Carborundum was originally used by printmakers to grind down lithography stones and is now used in collagraph prints to create gradients of tone and a sandy texture. It works because when the carborundum adheres to the plate the ink sits around it. It can be applied in a number of different ways: *Painting onto the plate with a liquid glue and then sprinkling the carborundum onto it *Mixing different amounts of glue with it and then painting them on in sections, the more grit used the darker. Example: one spoon of carborundum to five spoons of glue will be much lighter than five spoons of carborundum to five spoons of glue. *Using stencils to apply the glue and sprinkling different amounts of carborundum through the different stencils. To print a carborundum print, the surface is covered in ink, and then the surface is wiped clean with tarlatan cloth or newspaper, leaving ink only in the texture of the screen or carborundum. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper. Very large editions are not possible as a small amount of carborundum comes off every time it is wiped down. Uses Contrast with relief printing, and with planographic printing techniques such as lithography.

These polar rings are thought to form when two galaxies gravitationally interact with each other. One possibility is that a material is tidally stripped from a passing galaxy to produce the polar ring seen in the polar- ring galaxy. The other possibility is that a smaller galaxy collides orthogonally with the plane of rotation of the larger galaxy, with the smaller galaxy effectively forming the polar-ring structure. The best-known polar-ring galaxies are S0s (lenticular galaxies), but from the physical point of view they are part of a wider category of galaxies, including several ellipticals. The first four S0 galaxies that were identified as polar-ring galaxies were NGC 2685, NGC 4650A, A 0136 -0801, and ESO 415 -G26. While these galaxies have been extensively studied, many other polar-ring galaxies have since been identified. Polar-ring S0 galaxies may be found around 0.5% of all nearby lenticular galaxies, and it is possible that 5% of lenticular galaxies may have had polar rings at some point during their lifetimes. The first polar- ring elliptical galaxies were identified in 1978. They were NGC 5128, NGC 5363, NGC 1947 and Cygnus A,, while the polar-ring S0 galaxies NGC 2685 and NGC 4650A were at that time indicated as resulting from similar formation processes. Only some years later, when the first observations of the stellar and gas motion of polar-ring elliptical and S0 galaxies were possible with a better spectroscopic technology, the external origin of the gaseous rings was clarified. In addition to the best-known example, NGC 5128 (Cen A), a very regular polar ring elliptical, is NGC 5266 SPRC (Old Version) The SPRC is the Sloan Polar-Ring Catalogue, an atlas of 157 polar-ring galaxies. It was put together with images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.There are four sections (A,B,C, and D). There are 6 galaxies in section A which are kinematically confirmed galaxies. There are 27 in section B, which are good candidates. In section C, there are 73 galaxies, which are possible candidates. And there are 51 galaxies in section D, which are related objects. SPRC (New Version) There is a revised version of the SPRC, with 275 candidates. There are 70 of the best candidates, 115 good candidates, 53 related objects, and 37 face-on rings.

As a career academy, Farragut emphasizes a curriculum that combines academic instruction with work-study experiences and vocational training. In addition to Education-To-Careers clusters, Farragut is also home to the General Patton JROTC program which functions as a school-within-a-school. The school is named for David Farragut, a naval hero of the American Civil War who later was named the first admiral in the United States Navy. The school's service area includes North Lawndale and South Lawndale.Watkins, William Henry. Black Protest Thought and Education (Volume 237 of Counterpoints : studies in the postmodern theory of education, ISSN 1058-1634). Peter Lang, 2005. , 9780820463124. p. 185 (Section \\"Farragut High School\\"). School history The original Farragut School opened its doors on September 4, 1894, as a new primary school. It was located on Spaulding Ave near 23rd Street in the South Lawndale neighborhood.‚ÄúThey Must Quit Play‚Äù Chicago Daily, August 27, 1894, Pg 8 Its 16 rooms were designed to accommodate up to 900 students. The Chicago Board of Education named the school after Civil War naval hero Admiral David Glasgow Farragut and appointed George R. Plumb to be Principal. On the first day of school, Farragut enrolled about 500 students in grades 1‚Äì4.‚ÄúBack to the Books‚Äù Chicago Daily', September 5, 1894, Pg 12 Those 500 students were among 175,000 students enrolled in Chicago's 200 schools in a year that saw a 15% increase in enrollment. In its early years, Farragut served as a primary school for thousands of neighborhood students. Two years after opening Farragut, Principal Plumb officiated at a ceremony to dedicate an oil portrait of Admiral Farragut. This portrait was presented to the school by the Farragut Post 602 of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) on June 26, 1896.‚ÄúGives the School a Portrait‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, June 27, 1896, Pg 10 The dedication ceremony included speeches by representatives of the Chicago Board of Education and the Grand Army of the Republic and the singing of ‚Äúpatriotic songs‚Äù by Farragut students. The portrait of Admiral Farragut still hangs in Farragut's south building. Principal Plumb was dismissed from Farragut in 1901 and was replaced by Mary E. Baker.‚ÄúForty Teachers Under the Axe‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, June 21, 1901, Pg 7 In the early years of the 20th century, the population of Chicago's southwest side continued to grow, and overcrowding at Farragut became a problem. To ease this overcrowding, the Chicago Board of Education approved $150,000 to build a sixteen-room addition and assembly hall for Farragut.‚ÄúMillions for New Schools‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, September 24, 1907, Pg 8 At the forefront of the construction effort was Farragut Principal Henry C. Cox, who had taken over from Mary Baker in 1904. Principal Cox believed that the primary reason Farragut students did not complete their high school education was a lack of facilities in the area that could accommodate them.‚ÄúThe History of Farragut‚Äù Lawndale Crawford Community Collection archived document, Author, date unknown The addition opened its doors as a high school at Spaulding and 24th streets on September 7, 1909 with Frank L. Morse as Principal.‚ÄúChildren go Back to School Today‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, September 7, 1908, Pg 4 The original building continued to operate as a primary school. One of the greatest challenges to keeping high school students in school during this time was the fact that many teenagers worked in factories around Chicago to supplement family income. In 1909, Principal Morse created a plan that would allow students to continue to work and go to school and still receive their income. In cooperation with such employers as the Chicago Malleable Iron Company, the International Harvester Company, and the Kimball Piano Company, students would alternate weeks between work and school. These students would be enrolled in a special vocational curriculum designed to improve their ‚Äúindustrial education.‚Äù‚ÄúAlternate Work With Study‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, September 25, 1909, Pg 3 Boys between the ages of 14 and 16 would be enrolled in the program and would receive their full weekly salary while in school. Young women were also part of the vocational education plan for Farragut, although with a different focus. Classes for girls fell under the category of ‚Äúdomestic sciences‚Äù and included beginning and advanced sewing, food study and cooking, sanitation and hygiene in the home, and history of industry.‚ÄúAll Girls to Sew in School‚Äù Chicago Daily Tribune, October 12, 1901, Pg 3 As the vocational programs increased in popularity, Farragut expanded quickly and in 1914, most were transferred to the new Harrison Technical High School at 24th St and Marshall Blvd. With space now available, Farragut opened its doors as a community center two nights a week. Classrooms were made available for organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls. In addition, adult education classes were organized to teach sewing, millinery, cooking, and typing. In addition, English language classes were offered free of charge to neighborhood residents. Young people and adults could also participate in sports, music, and art. In 1924, Farragut underwent another restructuring. The Chicago School Board created a new program that converted several schools into junior high schools housing grades seven and eight. The move was designed to ease overcrowding by reducing some schools from grades K-8 to K-6 and moving the older students to new schools. In September 1925, 7th and 8th grade students from the Farragut, Burns, Spry, and McCormick schools attended classes at Farragut Junior High School with Isabella Dolton as Principal. Students at Farragut in grades K-2 stayed in the original building, operating as an extension of the Burns school with the remaining students in grades 3‚Äì6 moved to the neighboring schools. By 1928, the continuing problem of school overcrowding led to the construction of an addition to the Farragut building. The plans included a south and west section of the building that effectively doubled its size. That year, Peter B. Ritzma became Principal following Isabella Dolton's election as Assistant Superintendent of Schools for the district. Farragut operated as a junior high school until the Chicago School Board decided to scrap the program and convert the junior high schools in the city to senior high schools in 1933. Farragut's attendance boundaries extended north to 16th Street and as far south as the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Vocational training returned to Farragut in 1935 following the establishment of the Emergency Education Program (EEP). The EEP was created under the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). In the early years of the Great Depression, thousands of teachers found themselves unemployed and seeking relief. Harry Hopkins, director of FERA, realized that there was an opportunity to not only return teachers to work but to also provide educational programs to other unemployed workers.‚ÄúThe Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)‚Äù, University of Washington Libraries Digital Collection, Available online at http://content.lib.washington.edu/feraweb/essay.html, Cited July 12, 2007 Under the EEP, Farragut began offering adult evening classes free of charge. Unemployed adults could attend classes in typing, dictaphone, shorthand (advanced and beginning), sewing, millwork, and printing. Mid-20th century to present In the post-World War II period the school demographics changed as more African-Americans moved into the surrounding neighborhoods, which had been previously populated with European immigrants and Jews; the student body and teaching staff became increasingly African-American. In 1950 the community around Farragut was 91.2% white and 8.6% black; this became 64.4% black and 35.3% white by 1960. Many black students residing in North Lawndale attended Farragut since North Lawndale did not have its own senior high school. By 1968 Farragut's student body was about 90% black, and the school was overcrowded since North Lawndale also fed into the school.Magallon, Frank S. Chicago's Little Village: Lawndale-Crawford (Images of America). Arcadia Publishing, 2010. p. 104. , 9780738577371. By 1968-1969 the \\"New Breed\\" and other groups of African-American students demanded that the school hire black teachers and administrators and that it fire Joseph Carroll, the principal of the school. Elizabeth Anders, author of \\"Everybody run Farragut,\\" a 1971 work, stated that the school administration, then dominated by White Americans, were not prepared for the change in demographics and that some teachers had no interest in serving black students; by 1971, according to Anders, discord among teachers and students and problems with gangs occurred by 1971. Around that time period some Hispanic and White students had accused groups of black students of harassment. In June 2006 CPS accused principal Edward Guerra, scheduled to retire from CPS and begin working at Waukegan High School, with changing grades of soccer players and asking teachers to not say anything about it.Dell'Angela, Tracy and Andrew L.

It is extensively used in the Dasam Granth hymns by Guru Gobind Singh, who titled one of his poetic compositions Akal Ustat; i.e., In Praise (ustati) of the Timeless One (akaal). However, the concept of Akaal is not peculiar to the Dasam Granth. It goes back to the very origins of the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak used the term in the Mool Mantar, the fundamental creedal statement in the Japji, the first composition in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term also occurs in Guru Ram Das, Nanak IV, who uses it in conjunction with murat in Siri Raga chants (GG. 78) and in conjunction with purakh in Gauri Purabi Karhale (GG, 235). The term occurs more frequently in Guru Arjan‚Äôs bani (e.g. GG, 99, 609, 916, 1079, and 1082). We encounter the use of the term akaal in Kabir as well. Different uses It may be noted that the term akal has been used in Gurbani in two forms: (a) as a qualifier or adjective, and (b) as a substantive. In the expression Akal Murat, the first part is often treated as a qualifier, even though some interpreters take the two words as independent units, viz. akal and murat. In the Maru Raka Kal and Akal have been clearly used as substantives by Guru Arjan and Kabir. Guru Gobind Singh more often than not treats the expression as a noun. Akal Ustat is the praise of Akal and ‚ÄúHail, O Akal, Hail, O Kirpal!‚Äù of Jaap Sahib also takes the related expressions as substantives. The meaning of Akal in this context is ‚Äòtimeless‚Äô, non-temporal‚Äô, ‚Äòdeathless‚Äô, ‚Äònot governed by temporal process‚Äô, or ‚Äònot subject to birth, decay, and death‚Äô. This appears to be negative coining in each case. But the intent is affirmative. Akal as deathless or non-temporal implies everlasting reality, eternal being, or Transcendent Spirit; it further implies Eternity, Being, or Essence. The linguistic form may be negative, but the semantic implication is unmistakably affirmative. Guru Gobind Singh Guru Gobind Singh in his Jaap Sahib in the Dasam Granth, has designated the Supreme Reality Akal. It is the same Reality that was given the epithet of sati in the Guru Granth Sahib. ‚ÄòSat‚Äô is the primordial name of the Eternal Being (GG, 1083). All the names that we utter in respect of God are functional or attributive names. The basic reality is nameless, in Guru Gobind Singh‚Äôs terminology anama. But even the Nameless can serve as a name. When we say Brahman is featureless, ‚Äòfeaturelessness‚Äô becomes its feature. Nirankar (Shapeless) is a name, and so are other epithets so coined. To signify what they regard as the Eternal Spirit, beyond the pale of time, temporality, or cosmic processes, the Gurus have chosen the terms Sat and Akal. Vahiguru is a positive saguna substitute for the negative nirguna term Akal. Another avenue of thought on this term Akal brings into play the word 'Kal' which can be translated to 'death' or 'time'. the a- prefix makes it the opposite so a-kal can mean not subject to death or time. Guru Gobind Singh‚Äôs bani is a repository of concepts and terms, especially of the epithets relating to ‚Äòtime‚Äô. Besides Kal and Akal, Guru ji uses Maha Kal (macro-time) and Sarb-Kal (all-time) to indicate a Being above and beyond the eventful times of the universe. For him, Kal itself is a dimension of Akal, the only difference being the process that characterizes temporal events, and the eternality of Akal. Every occurrence or event has a beginning and an end, each event is a link in the ongoing process of Time. The cosmic drama or the wondrous show of the world is all a creation of Time. The power of Time controls worldly events; the only entity independent of time is Time itself, and that is Akal, the Timeless One. That is how God is both Time and Timeless in Guru Gobind Singh‚Äôs bani. The temporal aspect of Time is the immanent aspect, the presence of Spiritual Essence in each worldly occurrence. It is the ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô of the Supreme, the chit or consciousness of sat-chit-anand. The other, transcendent aspect, is the Eternal, the Beyond, the Inexpressible, the Fathomless, Nirguna Brahman, assigned the name Akal, the Timeless One or the One-beyond-Time. Akal is not a fast substance, but the dynamic spiritual principle of the entire cosmic existence. The phenomenal world emanates from the Spirit, and the Spirit permeates the world. Akal in Sikh philosophy is not mere consciousness, bland and void, but is the Creative Spirit, as the expression Karta Purakh implies. In other words, creativity is the core of Akal. And it is creativity that is manifest in the dimension of Kal. Acting through Time, the Timeless One creates worlds and beings of the worlds. It is through creativity that the Timeless One transforms itself from nirgun to sargun, from the aphur state into saphur state, from the pre-creation sunn, or dormant essence, into cosmic existence. The creativity of Akal is not confined to the timeless and timeborne aspects of the Supreme. Through its sargun facet the nirgun assumes the character of the Divine, of the gracious God, the loving Lord or Prabhu of the devotees. From ‚ÄòIt‚Äô the Ultimate becomes ‚ÄòHe‚Äô, the person with whom communication is sought and established. From ‚ÄòAkal‚Äô, He becomes ‚ÄòSri-Akal‚Äô. The Sikh slogan and popular form of greeting Sati Sri Akal Sikh sums up the concept that the timeless Being is the singular Eternal Reality. The phrase combines the concepts of Sat and Akal, implying that the Eternal and the Timeless are one; Sat, itself is the Everlasting Lord-beyond- Time. Thus, the creative essence turns the metaphysical Being into active principle of the world, into conscious Power involved in the cosmic process, into Hero or Master of the world, cherishing His creation with benign joy. Being the beneficent Lord, He lends some of His creativity to the created beings. Humanity draws its creativity and creative energy from the Divine reservoir of creativity. Valour and heroism are pronounced characteristics of the Sikh tradition. The Akal of Guru Gobind Singh is All Steel (Sarb-Loh), symbolically applauding valour. Guru Nanak had applied the epithet of Jodha- Mahabali-Surma to the valiant in Japji, 27 (GG, 6). Guru Gobind Singh, Nanak X, expresses His creativities with terms such as Sarb-Kal (Jaap Sahib, 19, 20), Sarb-Dayal (Japu, 19, 23, 28), Sarb-Pal (Japu, 28, 45). He calls Him Glorious and great, Super-form, Yogi of yogis, Moon of moons, Melody of melodies, Rhythm of the dance, Liquidity of waters, Movement of the winds. He is Akal as well as Kripal, the Compassionate Lord. In fact, the whole composition of Japu, with its wide range of attributive names for the Timeless Being focuses on the Akal-Kripal unipolarity. The impersonal appears through all persons, the Timeless encompasses all timeborne beings emanating from His Essence. He transcends the human world, yet He is full of compassion for all. His timeless essence permeates the temporal existence. The concept of Akal, central to Guru Gobind Singh‚Äôs Jaap Sahib has percolated to the social, political, and cultural aspects of Sikh life. Inspired by its theme, they call the Gurus‚Äô, bani Akali-Bani. The political wing of the community is known as Akali Dal. The slogan Sati Sri Akal has become a form of greeting for the Punjabis in general. The process had been initiated much earlier, half a century before the advent of Guru Gobind Singh on the scene. The Sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind, had already identified the throne built at Amritsar as Akal Takht‚Äîthe Throne of the Timeless one.

The law was designed to prohibit picketing a funeral within 300 feet of a cemetery, mortuary or church between one hour before and two hours following an event. The impetus for the legislation was a group of protesters who made a habit of picketing military funerals, as a form of protest against the United States.

His father was Juan de Villagra, a minor civil official. In 1537 he moved from Spain to Cartagena de Indias, then to Santa Marta and later Peru. He arrived in Chile with the expedition of Pedro de Valdivia. With the founding of Santiago, Villagra held for 4 years the post of the city's mayor. Valdivia also granted him an encomienda in Tir√∫a. After the death of the governor, he moved back to Peru, where he married Beatriz de Figueroa. He returned to Chile when his nephew (cousin?) Francisco de Villagra was governor for the first time. He fought in the Arauco War and took command of the southern forces when the governor became ill. In 1556 he commanded the forces that drove Lautaro back from Santiago in the Battle of Peteroa. He again commanded forces under Francisco de Villagra when he became governor again in 1561. When Francisco de Villagra died on June 22, 1563, he left Pedro de Villagra as interim governor. This was later confirmed by the Viceroy of Peru, Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco. His military strategy led him to concentrate his forces, vacating the fort Arauco in order to reinforce Angol and Concepci√≥n. Some of the worst Mapuche defeats would be suffered through the attack on Angol, where the garrisoning forces led by Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado inflicted over a thousand of casualties and killed the toqui Illanguli√©n in the Battle of Angol. Later he headed a new campaign in the south, relieving the Siege of Concepcion and resulting in the victorious battles of Reinohuelen and Tolmill√°n against the Mapuches north of the Bio-Bio River. This series of defeats resulted in a few years of apparent peace between the Spanish and Mapuche. With the death of the viceroy L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco in 1564 the political situation deteriorated for Villagra. In 1565, at the orders of the new viceroy Lope Garc√≠a de Castro, he was replaced by Rodrigo de Quiroga, arrested, and sent to Peru, where he managed to clear his name. After his absolution he petitioned the king for the reparations he believed himself due, but he never received a response. He died in Lima on September 11, 1577.

Howard (born 1945) is a politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. She served two terms in the Nebraska Legislature, from 2005 to 2013, representing an Omaha district. Howard was born Gwen E. Middaugh, on June 24, 1945, in Douglas County, Nebraska. She graduated from Omaha Benson High School in 1963. In 1967, she received a degree in sociology and psychology from Midland Lutheran College; in 1974, a master's degree in social work from the University of Nebraska Omaha. She married David Howard, who was killed in a car accident in 1981; and had two daughters, Carrie Howard and Sara Howard. She worked as a social worker and adoption specialist. In 2004, Howard ran for the Nebraska Legislature from the 9th District, consisting of a portion of midtown Omaha. Incumbent Chip Maxwell, a member of the Republican Party, had decided to run for the Douglas County Board of Commissioners rather than seeking re-election. In the nonpartisan primary, Democrat Howard received 43% of the vote; Republican Scott Knudsen, a Republican mortgage banker who had unsuccessfully run for the seat in 2000, received 32%; and R. Anthony Metz received 25%. As the top two vote-getters, Howard and Knudsen moved on to the general election, in which Howard won the seat, with 56.7% of the vote to Knudsen's 43.3%. In 2008, Howard ran unopposed for re-election to her seat in the Legislature. During her legislative career, Howard served as vice- chairperson of the Education Committee and the Committee on Committees; she also sat on the Health and Human Services Committee and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee, and as one of Nebraska's seven commissioners in the interstate Education Commission of the States. Nebraska's term-limits law left Howard ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in the Legislature in 2012. She ran for the 2nd District seat in the U.S. Congress, held by Republican Lee Terry. In the Democratic primary, she lost to Douglas County treasurer John Ewing, taking 38% of the vote to Ewing's 62%. Ewing lost the general election, with 49.2% of the vote to incumbent Terry's 50.8%. Meanwhile, Howard's daughter, Sara Howard, ran for the seat that Howard was vacating. Sara, a Democrat, came in first in the three-way nonpartisan primary, and defeated Republican Erica Fish in the general election. In 2014, Howard was elected to an at-large seat on the Metropolitan Utilities District (MUD) board. MUD is a publicly owned utility that provides water and natural gas to the Omaha metropolitan area.

An Alp (plural Alpe or Alpen) is a supernatural being in German folklore. Not to be confused with the similarly named Alp-luachra, the Alp is sometimes likened to a vampire, but its behavior is more akin to that of the incubus. It is distinct from both of these creatures in that it wears a magic hat called a Tarnkappe, from which it draws its powers. The word Alp is the German form of the word that comes into English as elf, both descended from Common Germanic. It is also known by the following names: trud, mar, mart, mahr, schrat, and walrider. Many variations of the creature exist in surrounding European areas, such as the Druden and Schratteli, or Old Hag in English-speaking countries.  In medieval sources  In the period before about 1000, the Old High German word alp is attested only in a small number of glosses. It is defined by the Althochdeutsches W√∂rterbuch as a \\"nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the mare he messes around with women\\".'Naturgott oder -d√§mon, den Faunen der antiken Mythologie gleichgesetzt ... er gilt als gespenstisches, heimt√ºckisches Wesen ... als Nachtmahr spielt er den Frauen mit'; Karg- Gasterst√§dt and Frings 1968‚Äì, s.v. alb. Accordingly, the German word Alpdruck (literally 'elf-oppression') means 'nightmare'. There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.Edwards 1994. In a similar vein, elves are in Middle High German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people \\"in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: 'die elben/der alp trieget mich' (the elves/elf is/are deceiving me)\\".Edwards 1994, 16‚Äì17, at 17. The same pattern holds in Early Modern German.(Stallybrass tr.) In Lexer's Middle High German dictwionary under alp, alb is an example: Pf. arzb. 2 14b= (): \\"Swen der alp triuget, rouchet er sich mit der verbena, ime enwirret als pald niht;\\" meaning: 'When an alp deceives you, fumigate yourself with verbena and the confusion will soon be gone'. The editor glosses alp here as \\"malicious, teasing spirit\\" () This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth- century Heinrich von Morungen's fifth Minnesang begins \\"Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man / S√¥ bin ich von gr√¥zer lieber ents√™n\\" (\\"full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love\\").Edwards 1994, 13. Elbe was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.Edwards 1994, 17. In later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. Evidence includes Latin prayers found inscribed in lead amulets from southern Scandinavia and Schleswig.Rudolf Simek, 'Elves and Exorcism: Runic and Other Lead Amulets in Medieavl Popular Religion', in Myths, Legends, and Heroes: Essays on Old Norse and Old English Literature in Honour of John McKinnell (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 25-52 (. The most famous is the fourteenth-century M√ºnchener Nachtsegen, a prayer to be said at night, which includes the lines:Hall 2007, 125‚Äì26. > {: alb vnde ≈Ç elbelin : Ir sult nich beng' bliben hin : albes svestir vn > vatir : Ir sult uz varen obir dƒì gatir : albes mutir trute vn mar : Ir sult > uz zu dƒì virste varƒì : Noc mich dy mare druche : Noc mich dy trute zciche : > Noc mich dy mare rite : Noc mich dy mare bescrite : Alb mit diner crummen > nasen : Ich vorbithe dir aneblasen  : elf, or also little elf, : you shall > remain no longer (reading lenger) : elf's sister and father, : you shall go > out over the gate; : elf's mother, trute and mare, : you shall go out to the > roof-ridge! : Let the mare not oppress me, : let the trute not ?pinch me > (reading z√ºcke), : let the mare not ride me, : let the mare not mount me! : > Elf with your crooked nose, : I forbid you to blow on [people] } Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.Edwards 1994, 21‚Äì22. As in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. An elf does appear in an account of the parentage of the hero Hagen (ON H√∂gni) which survives only in the Old Norse √ûi√∞reks saga but which was translated from a German text (now lost).Thidrekksaga. ; Hayme's tr., ch. 169 Here, Hagen is the product of his mother Oda being impregnated by an elf (ON √°lfr) while she lies in bed. Otherwise, it seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves ().Motz 1983, esp. 23‚Äì66. Thus some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves, especially when the dwarf's name is Alberich, which etymologically means 'elf-powerful' (thus Jacob Grimm thought that the name echoed the notion of the king of the nation of elves or dwarves).(Stallybrass tr.) Lurker, Manfred (Ger. 1984, Eng. 1987) The Routeledge Dictionary of Gods, Goddesses, Devils and Demons p. 9, Routeledge & Kegan, The Alberich in the epic Ortnit is a dwarf of childlike-stature who turns out to be the real father of the titular hero, having raped his mother., citing The Alberich who aids Ortnit is paralleled by the French Auberon, who aids Huon de Bordeaux and whose name derives from Alberich., citing Grimm says Auberon derives from Alberich by a usual l‚Üíu change. Auberon entered English literature through Lord Berner's translation of the chanson de geste around 1540, then as Oberon, the king of elves and fairies in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (see below). As the apparent convergence with dwarves suggests, the word alp declined in use in German after the medieval period, though it still occurs in some fossilised uses, most prominently the word for \\"nightmare\\", Alptraum (\\"elf dream\\").Karg- Gasterst√§dt and Frings 1968‚Äì, s.v. albe; Edward 1994, 17. Variations of the German elf in later folklore include the moss peopleThistelton-Dyer, T.F. The Folk-lore of Plants, 1889. Available online by Project Gutenberg. File retrieved 3-05-07. and the weisse frauen ('white women').Marshall Jones Company (1930). The Mythology of All Races Series, Volume 2 Eddic, Great Britain: Marshall Jones Company, 1930, pp. 221‚Äì22. In Teutonic myth and folklore, Alpe were considered friendly elf-like beings which lived in the mountains, but eventually turned more negative and malevolent. The characteristic magic that the Alpe possess also bear the creature much resemblance to the Kobold, particularly Hodekin. As in English, however, twentieth-century fantasy fiction has helped to reinvigorate the term. J. R. R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form Elb in his Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings (1967) and Elb, Elben was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of The Lord of the Rings, having a role in repopularising the form in German.Hall 2014.  Post-medieval folklore  An Alp is typically male, while the mara and mart appear to be more feminine versions of the same creature. Its victims are often females,...Normally tormenting the nights and dreams of women, although men and children are also victims. Bunson, Matthew (1993) The Vampire Encyclopedia p. 4, 5, Gramercy, Curran, Dr. Bob (2005),Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures that Stalk the Night p. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, Career Press, whom it attacks during the night, controlling their dreams and creating horrible nightmares (hence the German word Alptraum [\\"elf dream\\"], meaning a nightmare). An Alp attack is called an Alpdruck, or often Alpdr√ºcke, which means \\"elf pressure\\". Alpdruck is when an Alp sits astride a sleeper's chest and becomes heavier until the crushing weight awakens the terrified and breathless dreamer. The victim awakes unable to move under the Alp's weight. This may have been an early explanation for sleep apnea and sleep paralysis, as well as night terrors. It may also include lucid dreams. Sexual attacks by the Alp are rare.Guiley, Rosemary Ellen (2004) The Encyclopedia of Vampires, Werewolves, and Other Monsters p. 20, Visionary Living, Inc. The Alp is often associated with vampires because it will drink blood from the nipples of men and young children, though women are the preferred victim of the invariably male Alp, for it favors the taste of breast milk. Alpe also exhibit a tendency for mischief similar to elves, like souring milk and re-diapering a baby; a maid must sign a cross on the diaper or the Alp will put the soiled diaper back on her child.http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/nightmare.html They also enjoy tangling hair into \\"elfknots\\" or chewing and twisting horse's tails. They will ride a horse to exhaustion during the night and may sometimes crush smaller farm animals such as geese to death during a pressing attack. Alpe are also similarly blamed for minor illnesses and milking cows dry, for they enjoy the taste of cow's milk as well. The Alp, in many cases, is considered a demon, but there have been some instances in which the Alp is created from the spirits of recently dead relatives, more akin to a spirit or ghost. Children may become an Alp if a woman bites a horse collar to ease the pain during an extremely long and tortuous childbirth. Also, a child born with a caul or hair on the palms may become an Alp. If a woman who is pregnant is frightened by an animal, the child may be born an Alp. Stillborn infants are also suspected to return from the grave as Alpe and torment their family. People who have eyebrows that meet are suspected to be Alpe.\\"Night-mares: Demons that Cause Nightmares\\" As with the case of werewolves, sometimes a normal human or animal may become an Alp during the night. They are typically unaware of their nocturnal activities and are invariably in disguise while doing so. Finding an Alp while it is not active simply requires injuring or otherwise marking it during one of its attacks, and seeking out the being with a similar mark during the day. The person can then be cured if it is found out who sent them the curse, or how they became cursed to begin with. Witchcraft is often the prime suspect in this case. Sometimes an Alp is a spirit summoned by a witch or an evil person wishing harm on another, and sent to torment them. Tricking an Alp may lead a person to its master.  Characteristics  The Alp is best known for its shapeshifting abilities, similar to the creatures from werewolf lore. It may change into a cat, pig, dog, snake or a small white butterfly.Mayberry, Jonathan Vampire Universe p. 14, 15, Citadel Press Books It has also been said that it can fly like a bird and ride a horse. The Alp always wears a hat, giving it an almost comical appearance. The hat is known as a Tarnkappe (the literal translation being \\"camouflage cap\\" or \\"cap of concealment\\") which is simply a hat (or less commonly a veil) that gives the Alp magic powers and the ability to turn invisible while worn (see also cloak of invisibility). The hat is visible no matter what shape the Alp takes. An Alp who has lost this hat will offer a great reward for its safe return. The Alp also possesses an \\"evil eye\\" whose gaze will inflict illness and misfortune. Removing or damaging this eye also removes the Alp's malicious intentions. Protections against an Alp include laying a broomstick under a pillow, iron horseshoes hung from the bedpost, placing shoes against the bed with the toes pointing toward the door, or placing a mirror on the chest. Steel and crosses are also used. If awoken by the Alp and finding him still there, one can address him by asking him to return in the morning to borrow something or have coffee. The Alp will dash away at once, arriving in the morning either in his \\"true\\" form, or else in the form of a human with eyebrows that meet to receive his gifts. The creature can be convinced to leave the victim alone at this time, but the Alp will beg pitifully and at length not to be turned away. Plugging up any holes, specifically keyholes, before a visitation will keep the Alp out. Plugging them during a visitation will invariably seal it inside the room, as they can leave only through their original entrance. A light kept constantly on during the night will also effectively ward off an Alp. A sentry may also be employed to wait and watch for the Alp to attack the helpless sleeper, the Alp may be driven away if caught by someone not under the Alp's influence. Similar to the German Neuntoter, Alpe are weakened or immobilized by shoving a lemon in its mouth should it be caught resting during the day. The Alp appears all but impossible to kill, and sometimes even after being turned away it may reappear years later in a worse mood.

Sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars: ecological, economic and socio-cultural. Successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all, ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests, reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change. The \\"Forest Principles\\" adopted at the Earth Summit (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 captured the general international understanding of sustainable forest management at that time. A number of sets of criteria and indicators have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global, regional, country and management unit level. These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests. The instrument was the first of its kind, and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together. The Sustainable Development Goal 15 is also a global initiative aimed at promoting the implementation of sustainable forest management.  Definition  A definition of SFM was developed by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (FOREST EUROPE), and has since been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It defines sustainable forest management as: > The stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, > that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, > vitality and their potential to fulfill, now and in the future, relevant > ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global > levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems. In simpler terms, the concept can be described as the attainment of balance ‚Äì balance between society's increasing demands for forest products and benefits, and the preservation of forest health and diversity. This balance is critical to the survival of forests, and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities. For forest managers, sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, how to use it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors ‚Äì commercial and non-commercial values, environmental considerations, community needs, even global impact ‚Äì to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed. The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, at the request of Member States, developed and launched the Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox in 2014, an online collection of tools, best practices and examples of their application to support countries implementing sustainable forest management. Because forests and societies are in constant flux, the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one. What constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change.  Criteria and indicators  Deforestation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil engineering (2009). An example of non-sustainable forest management. Criteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise, evaluate and implement sustainable forest management.Guidelines for Developing, Testing and Selecting Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management Ravi Prabhu, Carol J. P. Colfer and Richard G. Dudley. 1999. CIFOR. The Criteria & Indicators Toolbox Series. Criteria define and characterize the essential elements, as well as a set of conditions or processes, by which sustainable forest management may be assessed. Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion. Criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management. There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives, which collectively involve more than 150 countries.Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management: A Compendium. Paper compiled by Froyl√°n Casta√±eda, Christel Palmberg-Lerche and Petteri Vuorinen, May 2001. Forest Management Working Papers, Working Paper 5. Forest Resources Development Service, Forest Resources Division. FAO, Rome (unpublished). Three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests (also called the Montr√©al Process),Montr√©al Process Indicators Forest Europe,MCPFE indicators and the International Tropical Timber Organization.ITTO Countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators. Within countries, at the management unit level, efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management. The Center for International Forestry Research, the International Model Forest Network and researchers at the University of British Columbia have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators.International Model Forest Network Criteria and Indicators SFM Indicator Knowledge Base Criteria and Indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standards and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard. There appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management. Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives. The seven thematic areas are: * Extent of forest resources * Biological diversity * Forest health and vitality * Productive functions of forest resources * Protective functions of forest resources * Socio-economic functions * Legal, policy and institutional framework. This consensus on common thematic areas (or criteria) effectively provides a common, implicit definition of sustainable forest management. The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry.United Nations Forum on Forests (2004)Committee on Forestry (2003) These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the Non- Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument. On 5 January 2012, the Montr√©al Process, Forest Europe, the International Tropical Timber Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, acknowledging the seven thematic areas, endorsed a joint statement of collaboration to improve global forest-related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens. Ecosystem approach The Ecosystem Approach has been prominent on the agenda of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) since 1995 . The CBD definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in Malawi in 1995, known as the Malawi Principles.Malawi Principles The definition, 12 principles and 5 points of \\"operational guidance\\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties (COP5) in 2000. The CBD definition is as follows > The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, > water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in > an equitable way. Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a > balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An ecosystem approach is > based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on > levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential > structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their > environment. It recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are > an integral component of many ecosystems. Sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2004 (Decision VII/11 of COP7) to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems. The two concepts, sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach, aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations. In Europe, the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS) jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in 2006. Independent certification Growing environmental awareness and consumer demand for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest certification emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations. There are many potential users of certification, including: forest managers, scientists, policy makers, investors, environmental advocates, business consumers of wood and paper, and individuals. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed ‚Äì as defined by a particular standard ‚Äì and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale. This rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world. As a result, there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide, and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management. In its 2009‚Äì2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated: \\"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\\" Third-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products. There are more than fifty certification standards worldwide, addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures. Globally, the two largest umbrella certification programs are: * Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) * Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) The area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly. PEFC is the world's largest forest certification system, with more than two-thirds of the total global certified area certified to its Sustainability Benchmarks.UNECE/FAO Forest Products Annual Market Review In North America, there are three certification standards endorsed by PEFC ‚Äì the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standard, and the American Tree Farm System. FSC has five standards in North America ‚Äì one in the United States and four in Canada. While certification is intended as a tool to enhance forest management practices throughout the world, to date most certified forestry operations are located in Europe and North America. A significant barrier for many forest managers in developing countries is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard.Auer, M. (2012). 'Group forest certification for smallholders in Vietnam: An early test and future prospects'. Human ecology 40(1): 5‚Äì14.  Forest governance  400pxthumbright Countries participating in the UNREDD program and/or Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. Although a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by government, the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership.Agrawal, A., Chhatre, A, and Hardin, R. (2008). 'Changing Governance of the World's Forest'. Science 320: 1460‚Äì1462 Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges, evidence that the state is failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged.Lutz, E, and Caldecott, J. (1996). Decentralization and biodiversity: a world bank symposium. Washington: The World Bank. Under neo-liberal regimes in the developing countries, the role of the state has diminished and the market forces have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role.Hague, M. (1999). 'The Fate of sustainable development under neo-liberal regime in developing countries', International political review 20(2): 197‚Äì218. Though the critiques of neo-liberal policies have maintained that market forces are not only inappropriate for sustaining the environment, but are in fact a major cause of environmental destruction.Stokke (1999). 'Sustainable development: A multi-faceted challenge' European journal of development 3(1): 8‚Äì31. Hardin's tragedy of the commons (1968) has shown that the people cannot be left to do as they wish with land or environmental resources. Thus, decentralization of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance. The shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments, where this is occurring, is usually a part of broader decentralization process.Margulis, S. . 'Decentralized environmental management', Annual World Bank Report. According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization ‚Äì the transfer of authority from the central government to non- governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation ‚Äì centrally nominated local authority, (iii) Devolution ‚Äì transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) Deconcentration ‚Äì the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government. The major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making. In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government, while at the same time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity.Ribott, (1990). 'Accountable representation and power in Participatory and decentralized environmental management', Unasylva 50(4). This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity \\"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\\".World Bank 1988 Many reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest. (i) Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account.Lutz, E and Caldcott (1999) Decentralisation and biodiversity conservation, A World bank symposium. Washington: The World Bank (ii) National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control,Enters and Anderson (1999) Rethinking the decentralisation and devolution of biodiversity conservation Unasylva 50(4) thus, many protected area projects result in increased biodiversity loss and greater social conflict.Enters and Anderson (1999) Within the sphere of forest management, as state earlier, the most effective option of decentralization is \\"devolution\\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority.Rondinelli and Cheema (1981)Decentralization and development, sage publication, London However, apprehension about local governments is not unfounded. They are often short of resources, may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation.M, Larson \\"Natural resource and degradation in Nicaragua: Are local governments up to the job? Enters and Anderson (1999) point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging. Broadly speaking, the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when, in contrast with land use changes; driven by demand for food, fuel and profit.Larson (2002) It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic human needs in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal. Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of developing countries and greater governance role for local government, civil society, private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \\"communities\\".Rondinelli and Chaeema (1999) National Forest Funds The development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management. National forest funds (NFFs) are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources. As of 2014, there are 70 NFFs operating globally. Forest genetic resources Appropriate use and long-term conservation of forest genetic resources (FGR) is a part of sustainable forest management. In particular when it comes to the adaptation of forests and forest management to climate change. Genetic diversity ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions. Genetic diversity in forests also contributes to tree vitality and to the resilience towards pests and diseases. Furthermore, FGR has a crucial role in maintaining forest biological diversity at both species and ecosystem levels. Selecting carefully the forest reproductive material with emphasis on getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform stand of trees, is essential for sustainable use of FGR. Considering the provenance is crucial as well. For example, in relation to climate change, local material may not have the genetic diversity or phenotypic plasticity to guarantee good performance under changed conditions. A different population from further away, which may have experienced selection under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be reforested, might represent a more suitable seed source.  Regional action = In the Developing world  In December 2007, at the Climate Change Conference in Bali, the issue of deforestation in the developing world in particular was raised and discussed. The foundations of a new incentive mechanism for encouraging sustainable forest management measures was therefore laid in hopes of reducing world deforestation rates. This mechanism was formalized and adopted as REDD in November 2010 at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun by UNFCCC COP 16. Developing countries who are signatories of the CBD were encouraged to take measure to implement REDD activities in the hope of becoming more active contributors of global efforts aimed at the mitigation greenhouse gas, as deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD activities are formally tasked with \\"reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\\". REDD+ works in 3 phases. The first phase consists of developing viable strategies, while the second phase begins work on technology development and technology transfer to the developing countries taking part in REDD+ activities. The last phase measures and reports the implementation of the action taken  Canada  The province of Ontario has its own sustainable forest management measures in place. A little less than half of all the publicly owned forests of Ontario are managed forests, required by The Crown Forest Sustainability Act to be managed sustainably. Sustainable management is often done by forest companies who are granted Sustainable Forest Licenses which are valid for 20 years. The main goal of Ontario's sustainable forest management measures is to ensure that the forest are kept healthy and productive, conserving biodiversity, all whilst supporting communities and forest industry jobs. All management strategies and plans are highly regulated, arranged to last for a 10-year period, and follow the strict guidelines of the Forest Management Planning Manual. Alongside public sustainable forest management, the government of Ontario encourages sustainable forest management of Ontario's private forests as well through incentives  Russia  In 2019 after severe wildfires and public pressure the Russian government decided to take a number of measures for more effective forest management, what is considered as a big victory for the Environmental movement  Indonesia  In August 2019, a court in Indonesia stopped the construction of a dam that could heavily hurt forests and villagers in the area  United States of America  In the beginning of the year 2020 the \\"Save the Redwoods League\\" after a successful crowdfunding campaign bought \\" Alder Creek\\" a piece of land 583 acres large, with 483 big Sequoia trees including the 5th largest tree in the world. The organizations plan to make there forest thinning that is a controversial operation  Cameroon  In August 2020, the government of Cameroon suspended the permit for logging in the Ebo forest.

Error-correcting code memory (ECC memory) is a type of computer data storage that can detect and correct the most-common kinds of internal data corruption. ECC memory is used in most computers where data corruption cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, such as for scientific or financial computing. Typically, ECC memory maintains a memory system immune to single-bit errors: the data that is read from each word is always the same as the data that had been written to it, even if one of the bits actually stored has been flipped to the wrong state. Most non-ECC memory cannot detect errors, although some non-ECC memory with parity support allows detection but not correction.  Description  ECC protects against undetected memory data corruption, and is used in computers where such corruption is unacceptable, for example in some scientific and financial computing applications, or in file servers. ECC also reduces the number of crashes that are especially unacceptable in multi-user server applications and maximum-availability systems. Electrical or magnetic interference inside a computer system can cause a single bit of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) to spontaneously flip to the opposite state. It was initially thought that this was mainly due to alpha particles emitted by contaminants in chip packaging material, but research has shown that the majority of one-off soft errors in DRAM chips occur as a result of background radiation, chiefly neutrons from cosmic ray secondaries, which may change the contents of one or more memory cells or interfere with the circuitry used to read or write to them. Hence, the error rates increase rapidly with rising altitude; for example, compared to sea level, the rate of neutron flux is 3.5 times higher at 1.5 km and 300 times higher at 10-12 km (the cruising altitude of commercial airplanes).\\"A Survey of Techniques for Modeling and Improving Reliability of Computing Systems\\", IEEE TPDS, 2015 As a result, systems operating at high altitudes require special provision for reliability. As an example, the spacecraft Cassini‚ÄìHuygens, launched in 1997, contained two identical flight recorders, each with 2.5 gigabits of memory in the form of arrays of commercial DRAM chips. Thanks to built-in EDAC functionality, spacecraft's engineering telemetry reported the number of (correctable) single-bit-per-word errors and (uncorrectable) double-bit-per-word errors. During the first 2.5 years of flight, the spacecraft reported a nearly constant single-bit error rate of about 280 errors per day. However, on November 6, 1997, during the first month in space, the number of errors increased by more than a factor of four for that single day. This was attributed to a solar particle event that had been detected by the satellite GOES 9. There was some concern that as DRAM density increases further, and thus the components on chips get smaller, while at the same time operating voltages continue to fall, DRAM chips will be affected by such radiation more frequently ‚Äî since lower-energy particles will be able to change a memory cell's state. On the other hand, smaller cells make smaller targets, and moves to technologies such as SOI may make individual cells less susceptible and so counteract, or even reverse, this trend. Recent studies show that single-event upsets due to cosmic radiation have been dropping dramatically with process geometry and previous concerns over increasing bit cell error rates are unfounded.  Research  Work published between 2007 and 2009 showed widely varying error rates with over 7 orders of magnitude difference, ranging from 10‚àí10 error/bit¬∑h (roughly one bit error per hour per gigabyte of memory) to 10‚àí17 error/bit¬∑h (roughly one bit error per millennium per gigabyte of memory). A large-scale study based on Google's very large number of servers was presented at the SIGMETRICS/Performance ‚Äô09 conference. The actual error rate found was several orders of magnitude higher than the previous small- scale or laboratory studies, with between 25,000 (2.5 √ó 10‚àí11 error/bit¬∑h) and 70,000 (7.0 √ó 10‚àí11 error/bit¬∑h, or 1 bit error per gigabyte of RAM per 1.8 hours) errors per billion device hours per megabit. More than 8% of DIMM memory modules were affected by errors per year. The consequence of a memory error is system-dependent. In systems without ECC, an error can lead either to a crash or to corruption of data; in large-scale production sites, memory errors are one of the most-common hardware causes of machine crashes. Memory errors can cause security vulnerabilities. A memory error can have no consequences if it changes a bit which neither causes observable malfunctioning nor affects data used in calculations or saved. A 2010 simulation study showed that, for a web browser, only a small fraction of memory errors caused data corruption, although, as many memory errors are intermittent and correlated, the effects of memory errors were greater than would be expected for independent soft errors. Some tests conclude that the isolation of DRAM memory cells can be circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to adjacent cells. Thus, accessing data stored in DRAM causes memory cells to leak their charges and interact electrically, as a result of high cell density in modern memory, altering the content of nearby memory rows that actually were not addressed in the original memory access. This effect is known as row hammer, and it has also been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits. An example of a single-bit error that would be ignored by a system with no error-checking, would halt a machine with parity checking, or would be invisibly corrected by ECC: a single bit is stuck at 1 due to a faulty chip, or becomes changed to 1 due to background or cosmic radiation; a spreadsheet storing numbers in ASCII format is loaded, and the character \\"8\\" (decimal value 56 in the ASCII encoding) is stored in the byte that contains the stuck bit at its lowest bit position; then, a change is made to the spreadsheet and it is saved. As a result, the \\"8\\" (0011 1000 binary) has silently become a \\"9\\" (0011 1001).  Solutions  Several approaches have been developed to deal with unwanted bit-flips, including immunity-aware programming, RAM parity memory, and ECC memory. This problem can be mitigated by using DRAM modules that include extra memory bits and memory controllers that exploit these bits. These extra bits are used to record parity or to use an error-correcting code (ECC). Parity allows the detection of all single-bit errors (actually, any odd number of wrong bits). The most-common error correcting code, a single-error correction and double- error detection (SECDED) Hamming code, allows a single-bit error to be corrected and (in the usual configuration, with an extra parity bit) double- bit errors to be detected. Chipkill ECC is a more effective version that also corrects for multiple bit errors, including the loss of an entire memory chip.  Implementations  Seymour Cray famously said \\"parity is for farmers\\" when asked why he left this out of the CDC 6600. Later, he included parity in the CDC 7600, which caused pundits to remark that \\"apparently a lot of farmers buy computers\\". The original IBM PC and all PCs until the early 1990s used parity checking. Later ones mostly did not. Many current microprocessor memory controllers support ECC, but many motherboards and in particular those using low-end chipsets do not. An ECC-capable memory controller can detect and correct errors of a single bit per 64-bit \\"word\\" (the unit of bus transfer), and detect (but not correct) errors of two bits per 64-bit word. The BIOS in some computers, when matched with operating systems such as some versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows, allows counting of detected and corrected memory errors, in part to help identify failing memory modules before the problem becomes catastrophic. Some DRAM chips include \\"internal\\" on-chip error correction circuits, which allow systems with non-ECC memory controllers to still gain most of the benefits of ECC memory. A. H. Johnston. \\"Space Radiation Effects in Advanced Flash Memories\\" . NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging Program (NEPP). 2001. In some systems, a similar effect may be achieved by using EOS memory modules. Error detection and correction (EDAC) depends on an expectation of the kinds of errors that occur. Implicitly, it is assumed that the failure of each bit in a word of memory is independent, resulting in improbability of two simultaneous errors. This used to be the case when memory chips were one-bit wide, what was typical in the first half of the 1980s; later developments moved many bits into the same chip. This weakness is addressed by various technologies, including IBM's Chipkill, Sun Microsystems' Extended ECC, Hewlett Packard's Chipspare, and Intel's Single Device Data Correction (SDDC). DRAM memory may provide increased protection against soft errors by relying on error correcting codes. Such error- correcting memory, known as ECC or EDAC-protected memory, is particularly desirable for high fault-tolerant applications, such as servers, as well as deep-space applications due to increased radiation. Some systems also \\"scrub\\" the memory, by periodically reading all addresses and writing back corrected versions if necessary to remove soft errors. Interleaving allows for distribution of the effect of a single cosmic ray, potentially upsetting multiple physically neighboring bits across multiple words by associating neighboring bits to different words. As long as a single event upset (SEU) does not exceed the error threshold (e.g., a single error) in any particular word between accesses, it can be corrected (e.g., by a single-bit error correcting code), and an effectively error-free memory system may be maintained. Error-correcting memory controllers traditionally use Hamming codes, although some use triple modular redundancy (TMR). The latter is preferred because its hardware is faster than that of Hamming error correction scheme. Space satellite systems often use TMR, although satellite RAM usually uses Hamming error correction. Many early implementations of ECC memory mask correctable errors, acting \\"as if\\" the error never occurred, and only report uncorrectable errors. Modern implementations log both correctable errors (CE) and uncorrectable errors (UE). Some people proactively replace memory modules that exhibit high error rates, in order to reduce the likelihood of uncorrectable error events. Doug Thompson, Mauro Carvalho Chehab. \\"EDAC - Error Detection And Correction\\" . 2005 - 2009. \\"The 'edac' kernel module goal is to detect and report errors that occur within the computer system running under linux.\\" Many ECC memory systems use an \\"external\\" EDAC circuit between the CPU and the memory. A few systems with ECC memory use both internal and external EDAC systems; the external EDAC system should be designed to correct certain errors that the internal EDAC system is unable to correct. Modern desktop and server CPUs integrate the EDAC circuit into the CPU, even before the shift toward CPU-integrated memory controllers, which are related to the NUMA architecture. CPU integration enables a zero-penalty EDAC system during error-free operation. As of 2009, the most-common error-correction codes use Hamming or Hsiao codes that provide single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection (SEC-DED). Other error-correction codes have been proposed for protecting memory double-bit error correcting and triple-bit error detecting (DEC-TED) codes, single-nibble error correcting and double-nibble error detecting (SNC-DND) codes, Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction codes, etc. However, in practice, multi-bit correction is usually implemented by interleaving multiple SEC-DED codes.Doe Hyun Yoon; Mattan Erez. \\"Memory Mapped ECC: Low- Cost Error Protection for Last Level Caches\\". 2009. p. 3Daniele Rossi; Nicola Timoncini; Michael Spica; Cecilia Metra. \\"Error Correcting Code Analysis for Cache Memory High Reliability and Performance\\" . Early research attempted to minimize the area and delay overheads of ECC circuits. Hamming first demonstrated that SEC-DED codes were possible with one particular check matrix. Hsiao showed that an alternative matrix with odd weight columns provides SEC-DED capability with less hardware area and shorter delay than traditional Hamming SEC-DED codes. More recent research also attempts to minimize power in addition to minimizing area and delay.Shalini Ghosh; Sugato Basu; and Nur A.

The ECC/ECC technique uses an ECC-protected level 1 cache and an ECC-protected level 2 cache. Nathan N. Sadler and Daniel J. Sorin. \\"Choosing an Error Protection Scheme for a Microprocessor‚Äôs L1 Data Cache\\". 2006\\\\. p. 1. CPUs that use the EDC/ECC technique always write-through all STOREs to the level 2 cache, so that when an error is detected during a read from the level 1 data cache, a copy of that data can be recovered from the level 2 cache.  Registered memory  Two 8 GB DDR4-2133 ECC 1.2 V RDIMMs Registered, or buffered, memory is not the same as ECC; the technologies perform different functions. It is usual for memory used in servers to be both registered, to allow many memory modules to be used without electrical problems, and ECC, for data integrity. Memory used in desktop computers is neither, for economy. However, unbuffered (not-registered) ECC memory is available, and some non-server motherboards support ECC functionality of such modules when used with a CPU that supports ECC.Specification of desktop motherboard that supports both ECC and non-ECC unbuffered RAM with compatible CPUs Registered memory does not work reliably in motherboards without buffering circuitry, and vice versa.  Advantages and disadvantages  Ultimately, there is a trade-off between protection against unusual loss of data, and a higher cost. ECC memory usually involves a higher price when compared to non-ECC memory, due to additional hardware required for producing ECC memory modules, and due to lower production volumes of ECC memory and associated system hardware. Motherboards, chipsets and processors that support ECC may also be more expensive. ECC support varies among motherboard manufacturers so ECC memory may simply not be recognized by a ECC-incompatible motherboard. Most motherboards and processors for less critical applications are not designed to support ECC so their prices can be kept lower. Some ECC- enabled boards and processors are able to support unbuffered (unregistered) ECC, but will also work with non-ECC memory; system firmware enables ECC functionality if ECC memory is installed. ECC may lower memory performance by around 2‚Äì3 percent on some systems, depending on the application and implementation, due to the additional time needed for ECC memory controllers to perform error checking. However, modern systems integrate ECC testing into the CPU, generating no additional delay to memory accesses as long as no errors are detected.Benchmark of AMD-762/Athlon platform with and without ECC ECC supporting memory may contribute to additional power consumption due to error correcting circuitry.

It is a quantization explanation involving quantum mechanics, originally stipulated in 1997 and further republished in 2004 by Francesco Calogero that suggests the classical stochastic background field to which Edward Nelson attributes quantum mechanical behavior in his theory of stochastic quantization is a fluctuating space-time, and that there are further mathematical relations between the involved quantities. The hypothesis itself suggests that if the angular momentum associated with a stochastic tremor with spatial coherence provides an action purported by that motion within the order of magnitude of Planck's constant then the order of magnitude of the associated angular momentum has the same value. Calogero himself suggests that these findings, originally based on the simplified model of the universe \\"are affected (and essentially, unaffected) by the possible presence in the mass of the Universe of a large component made up of particles much lighter than nucleons\\". Essentially, the relation explained by Calogero can be expressed with the formulas: :h \\\\approx \\\\alpha G^{1/2} m^{3/2} [R(t)]^{1/2}. Furthermore: :h \\\\equiv h(t) = A \\\\sqrt{R(t)} = h_0 \\\\sqrt{a(t)} Const G,m Where: :G represents the gravitational constant :m represents the mass of a hydrogen atom. :R(t) represents the radius of the universe accessible by gravitational interactions in time, t. :A is a dimensional constant. Despite its common description, it has been noted that the conjecture is not entirely defined within the realms of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, but can also be thought of as a means of inquiring into the statistical effects of interaction with distant masses in the universe and was expected by Calogero himself to be within the same order of magnitude as quantum mechanical effects.  Analysis = Compatibility with fundamental constants  After the publication of Calogero's original paper, \\"[The] [c]osmic origin of quantization\\" a response was published by Giuseppe Gaeta of the University of Rome in which he discussed the compatibility of the conjecture with present bounds on variation of fundamental constants, but also outlined his focus on the modification of the relation between redshift and distance, and of the estimations attained from observations of elapsed time from the production of cosmic radiation and implications‚Äîboth being related also, to the observed blackbody distribution of background cosmic radiation.

Originally finding fame as performance artists specialising in art intervention, they have since diversified, engaging in numerous works in both Asia and Europe. Life Born in China, Cai Yuan (1956) and JJ Xi (1962), have been based in the UK since the 1980s. Cai Yuan trained in oil painting at Nanjing College of Art, and gained a BA from Chelsea College of Art and Design in 1989, and his MA from the Royal College of Art, London in 1991. JJ Xi trained at the Central Academy of Applied Arts in Beijing and later at Goldsmiths College. They started working as a performance duo in 1999 with Two Artists Jump on Tracey Emin‚Äôs Bed (1999). Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey's Bed At 12.58 p.m. on 25 October 1999, Cai Yuan and Jian Jun Xi jumped on Tracey Emin's installation My Bed, a work incorporating memorabilia on and around an unmade bed, in the Turner Prize at Tate Britain. They called their performance Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey's Bed (although in fact they kept their trousers on). They had in mind including some \\"critical sex\\" as they considered \\"a sexual act was necessary to fully respond to Tracey's piece\\", although this part of their intention was not fulfilled.

The police and security guards were booed when they took the pair away. Cai and Xi were arrested for their action, but no charges were pressed, since \\"neither the gallery nor the artist had any desire to bring the matter further\\". Cai considered that, although Emin's work was strong, it was nevertheless institutionalised and said, \\"We want to push the idea further. Our action will make the public think about what is good art or bad art. We didn't have time to do a proper performance. I thought I should touch the bed and smell the bed.\\" He had various words written in Chinese and English on his body, such as \\"Internationalism\\", \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Idealism\\".

One of the words prominent along the length of Cai's torso was \\"Anti-Stuckism\\", although the Stuckists had themselves been critical of Emin's art. However, Cai and Xi's explanation is that they were not anti Emin's type of work (which they merely wanted to \\"improve\\"‚Äî\\"We are simply trying to react to the work and the self-promotion implicit in it\\"), but were opposed to the Stuckists, who are anti-performance art.\\"The Jumping Chinese Gentlemen at It again\\" Herr von Stuck's Hot Gossip Page Retrieved 22 March 2006 According to Fiachra Gibbons of The Guardian, the event \\"will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement.\\" The Tate's official pronouncement was \\"The work has now been restored and the exhibition will open to the public as usual at 10 a.m.\\", but they would not be drawn on the nature of the restoration.

Hudkins (born February 21, 1945) is a politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. She served in the Nebraska Legislature for four terms, covering sixteen years. Early life and career Hudkins was born in North Platte, Nebraska. She graduated from high school in Waverly, then attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. She married Larry Hudkins in 1964; the couple farmed near Malcolm, and Hudkins worked as a medical transcriptionist. She was elected to the Malcolm school board, and served as its chair. Legislative elections In 1992, Hudkins ran for the Nebraska Legislature from District 21, which then consisted of parts of Lancaster, Saunders, and Sarpy Counties. In the nonpartisan primary election, she placed first of five candidates, with 31.7% of the vote to Bill Sapp's 28.3%. As the top two vote-getters, she and Sapp moved on to the general election, which Hudkins won with 57% of the vote to Sapp's 43%. In 1996, Hudkins defended her seat from a challenge by Carol Yoakum and Dale McClure, both of Lincoln. In the primary, Hudkins took 59.3% of the vote; Yoakum, 27.3%; and McClure, 13.4%. In the general election, Hudkins received 64.3% of the vote to Yoakum's 35.4%. Hudkins ran unopposed for re-election to her seat in the legislature in 2000, and again in 2004. In 2000, Nebraska voters passed a term-limits amendment to the state's constitution, under which state legislators could serve no more than two terms consecutively. This rendered Hudkins ineligible to run for re-election in 2008, in which year she announced her retirement. Legislative career During her tenure in the Legislature, Hudkins served on the Rules Committee, of which she was chairperson; the Natural Resources Committee, of which she was vice-chairperson; the Judiciary Committee, of which she was vice- chairperson; the Agriculture Committee; the General Affairs Committee; the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee; and the Executive Board. In the Legislature, Hudkins proposed a bill to license and regulate acupuncturists so that they could practice in Nebraska; the measure passed in 2001. Hudkins also sponsored legislation to lower the legal blood-alcohol level for drivers from 0.10% to 0.08%. Recently passed federal legislation that withheld highway funds from states that failed to adopt the lower limit played a role in the passage of the measure.

This rearrangement, a ring expansion, is seen to be general if there is an enolizable hydrogen on the group attached to the nitrogen, since it is necessary for the nitrogen to abstract a hydrogen to form the carbanion that will close the ring. As shown in the case of the general example below, X is either CO or SO2. Gabriel-Colman Rearrangement Overall Reaction Mechanism Gabriel-Colman Rearrangement Mechanism The reaction mechanism starts with an attack on the carbonyl group by a strong base, such as methoxide ion. The ring is then opened, forming an imide anion. This is then followed by a rapid isomerization of the imide anion to the carbanion. This is facilitated by the electron withdrawing effect of the substituent, which allows for greater stabilization of the adjacent carbanion with respect to the imide anion. The reaction is then completed when the methoxide is displaced by the ring closing, which results in a ring expansion. The rate determining step of this reaction is the attack of the carbanion on the carbomethoxy group. The displacement of the methoxide is analogous to the displacement seen in the Dieckman condensation, as it is also a result of a ring closure. Gabriel- Colman Rearrangement Tautomerism Furthermore, tautomerization can occur on both of the carbonyl groups on the ring, with interconversion of the keto form to the enol form and the amide form to the imidic acid form. Applications The major application of the Gabriel‚ÄìColman rearrangement is in the formation of isoquinolines, due to the relatively high yield of the desired products. Therefore, studies in which either the product or an intermediate is an isoquinoline, the Gabriel‚ÄìColman rearrangement can be utilized. This reaction has been utilized in the production of intermediates for the synthesis of potential anti-inflammatory agents. It has also been used in the study of phthalimide and saccharin derivatives as mechanism based inhibitors for three enzymes; the human leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3. Phthalimide derivatives were seen to be inactive, while saccharin derivatives were seen to be fair inhibitors of these enzymes. Gabriel-Colman Rearrangement Example 1 In a study of the derivatives of 3-Oxo-1,2-benzoisothiazoline-2-acetic acid 1,1-dioxide, the Gabriel‚ÄìColman rearrangement was employed in the conversion of Isopropyl (1,1-dioxido-3-oxo-1,2-benzothiazol-2(3H)-yl)acetate to Isopropyl 4-hydroxy-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate 1,1-dioxide, as shown above. This reaction has shown a percent yield of 85%. Gabriel-Colman Rearrangement Example 2 In another study, N-phthalimidoglycine ethyl ester was used to synthesize 4-hydroxyisoquinoline through use of a Gabriel‚ÄìColman rearrangement, as shown above. This reaction has shown a percent yield of 91%. The formation of this product was an important step in the study of the synthesis of 4,4‚Ä≤-functionalized 1,1‚Ä≤-biisoquinolines.

It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1906. Jeremy's origin lies in a letter she wrote to a child in 1893. She revised it in 1906, and moved its setting from the River Tay to the English Lake District. The tale reflects her love for the Lake District and her admiration for children's illustrator Randolph Caldecott. Jeremy Fisher is a frog that lives in a \\"slippy-sloppy\\" house at the edge of a pond. During one rainy day, he collects worms for fishing and sets off across the pond on his lily-pad boat. He plans to invite his friends for dinner if he catches more than five minnows. He encounters all sorts of setbacks to his goal, and escapes a large trout who tries to swallow him. He swims for shore, decides he will not go fishing again, and hops home. Potter's tale pays homage to the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing at rented country estates in Scotland. Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote to Potter suggesting Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded with a series of miniature letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy and his friends were released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.  Plot  Mr Jeremy Fisher and the Stickleback. Jeremy Fisher is a frog that lives in a damp little house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond. His larder and back passage are \\"slippy- sloppy\\" with water, but he likes getting his feet wet; no one ever scolds and he never catches cold. One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five minnows, he would invite his friends to dinner. He puts on a mackintosh and shiny galoshes, takes his rod and basket, and sets off with \\"enormous hops\\" to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows. Once there, the frog sits cross-legged on his lily-pad and arranges his tackle. He has \\"the dearest little red float\\". His rod is a stalk of grass and his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe, causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line into the water and immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines and Jack escapes. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy. Jeremy sucks his sore fingers. A trout rises from the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, \\"OW-OW-OW!!!\\"). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the mackintosh bad-tasting and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his galoshes. Jeremy bounces \\"up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle\\", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again. In the last few pages, Jeremy has put sticking plaster on his fingers and welcomes his friends, Sir Isaac Newton, a newt; and Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise, a tortoise that eats salad. Isaac wears a black and gold waistcoat and Ptolemy brings a salad in a string bag. Jeremy has prepared roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce. The narrator describes the dish as a \\"frog treat\\", but thinks \\"it must have been nasty!\\"MacDonald 1986, p. 96Potter 2002, pp. 6-57  Background  In addition to the pet frogs of Potter's youth,Lane 1978, p. 149 influences on Jeremy include Potter's sport fishing father Rupert William Potter and illustrator Randolph Caldecott. Margaret Lane, author of The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter, notes, \\"Mr. Potter was fond of taking his friends fishing and Beatrix ... from an early age had been familiar with [the] hazards and excitements of angling and dry-fly fishing ... as a girl [she] had often enough had to endure her father and his friends relating their fishing adventures, and the picture of Mr Jeremy Fisher retailing his mishap to Sir Isaac Newton is so rich in observation, both of amphibians and elderly gentlemen, that one is ever afterwards prone to confuse them in memory\\".Lane 1978, pp. 149,152 Mr. Potter not only fished for sport but collected the works of Randolph Caldecott.Lear 2007, p. 47 In Jeremy Fisher, Potter tried to copy Caldecott but felt she had failed. \\"I did try to copy Caldecott,\\" she stated, \\"but ... I did not achieve much resemblance.\\"Taylor 1987, p. 129 Biographer Linda Lear writes Potter declared, \\"I have the greatest admiration for his work - a jealous appreciation; for I think that others, whose names are commonly bracketed with his, are not on the same plane at all as artist- illustrators\\". Potter biographer Linda Lear and author of Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature writes: > [Potter] wanted to do a frog story for some time, because it was amusing and > offered the opportunity for the naturalist illustrations she delighted in > ... The story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded Beatrix of the 'fish > stories' her father's friends had told in Scotland, as well as her brother's > travails with rod and reel. She also recreated the gentlemen's club > atmosphere absorbed from her father's reports of evenings spent at the > Reform and the Athenaeum ... The text and illustrations for this story are > some of the most balanced and compatible of all her writing. Nature is > described and illustrated truthfully: beautifully tranquil as well as > unpredictably aggressive ....Its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of > water plants, a frog with anatomically correct turned-out feet, a trout that > any self-respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging, and a rather > frighteningly rendered water-beetle who tweaks Jeremy's dainty toes, all > made it a delight to look at as well as to read.Lear 2007, pp. 212-3  Production  The River Tay (2004) The origin of The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher lies in a story letter Potter wrote to a child in September 1893 while summering on the River Tay.Lear 2007, pp. 211-2 The following year, she created nine sketches called \\"A Frog he would a-fishing go\\" and sold them to publisher Ernest Nister. They were released with verses by Clifton Bingham in 1896.Collecting Caldecott Energized by the success of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter considered expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks. She wrote her editor Norman Warne, \\"I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher ... I think I can make something of him\\".Taylor 1987, pp. 126-7Taylor 1996, pp. 80-1 The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's illustrations for Jeremy: \\"When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist\\".Kutzer 2003, p. 117 In August 1905, Norman Warne died, and his brother Harold became Potter's editor. She wrote to him indicating Norman had approved the frog project: \\"We had thought of doing ... \\"Mr. Jeremy Fisher\\" to carry on the series of little [books]. I know some people don't like frogs! but I think I had convinced Norman that I could make it a really pretty book with a good many flowers & water plants for backgrounds\\".Taylor 1996, p. 111 Warne decided to put Jeremy Fisher into print.Taylor 1996, p. 106 In July 1906, 20,000 copies of The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher were released in paper boards at a shilling and in decorated cloth at one shilling six pence in a small format. Another 5,000 copies were published in September 1906 and another 5,000 in September 1907.Linder 1971, p. 426 The book was dedicated to Stephanie Hyde Parker, the daughter of Potter's cousin Ethel, Lady Hyde Parker: \\"For Stephanie from Cousin B\\".Lear 2007, pp. 211-3 Jeremy sold as profitably as other Potter productions.Lane 1978, p. 152 Themes and style  Mr. Jeremy Fisher fishing. M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at State University of New York at Plattsburgh and author of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code, observes that the social positions of Jeremy and his friends are established through the clothing they wear. Although Potter sharply critiqued the upper class elsewhere, Kutzer observes that in Jeremy Fisher her tone is more moderate. She suggests that Potter's relocation to Sawrey and Hill Top Farm may have produced in her a willingness \\"to accept the silliness of the aspiring middle class as well as the eccentricities of the upper classes\\".Kutzer 2003, p. 121 Ruth K. MacDonald, Professor of English at New Mexico State University and author of Beatrix Potter points out that although Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in Jeremy Fisher. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, as evidenced by the careful observation in the illustrations. Jeremy Fisher was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, and the pictures appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, \\"Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success\\".MacDonald 1986, p. 98 Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes in Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature the basis for Potter's writing style can be found in the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Jeremy Fisher reflects the characteristic cadence and \\"employs a psalm-like caesura in the middle of [a] sentence\\".Carpenter, p. 143 Carpenter sees in Potter's work thematic shifts from the early work onward. In the first stage of her work, he sees in stories such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in The Tale of Jeremy Fisher. Potter places Jeremy Fisher in a dangerous world, according to Carpenter. The fishing experience is frightening: the bank-side creatures worry him, the stickleback threatens him directly, and the trout tries to swallow him. But Potter makes the point that all creatures are prey, ending the story with Jeremy Fisher himself eating a grasshopper smothered in lady-bird sauce.Carpenter, 145-147  Miniature letters  About 1907 Potter created miniature letters delivered to child fans in either a miniature mail bag or a miniature mail box. \\"Some of the letters were very funny,\\" Potter wrote, \\"The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up.\\"Linder 1971, p. 72 Four Jeremy letters were written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac promises Master Fayle a piece of wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties \\"would be much more agreeable if there were a lady to preside at the table.\\" Jeremy writes in the third letter: \\"When I bought my sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I am alone ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction to be able to have as much water & mud in the house as a person likes.\\" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, a hedgehog washerwoman in another Potter tale, writes Master Fayle in the fourth letter: > Dear Master Drew, > If you please Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong that there is not > any Mrs. Fisher, but I would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he > does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & > not a bit of good starching his cravats. > Yr. obedient washerwoman,Tiggy Winkle.Linder 1971, pp. 79-80  Merchandise  The characters from Jeremy Fisher have appeared as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise. In 1950, Beswick Pottery issued a porcelain figurine of Jeremy and figurines of Isaac and Ptolemy in the 1970s. Other figurines of Jeremy have been produced over the years as well as a Jeremy mug.DuBay 2006, pp. 30,35 Jeremy was one of the first eight plush toys released by Eden Toys, Inc. of New York in 1973. The following year, he was released as a \\"Giant\\" intended for store displays, and during the Beanie Baby era as a beanbag.

The transmitter is off NE 122nd Street in Oklahoma City, near the John Kilpatrick Turnpike.Radio-Locator.com/KXXY-FM History The station signed on in October 1964 as the second KOCY-FM in Oklahoma City. (The original KOCY-FM was the first FM station in Oklahoma, operating from 1946 to 1950.) For its first five years, it simulcast the middle of the road music programming of co-owned KOCY (1340 AM). In the late 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission began encouraging AM-FM combos to offer separate programming. In 1969, KOCY-FM switched to progressive rock, styled after stations such as KMPX in San Francisco and WNEW-FM in New York City. On October 24, 1972, the station changed its call sign to KXXY-FM to give it a separate identity from its AM sister station. Over time, it moved from free form progressive rock to a more tightly-formatted album-oriented rock sound. After 13 years of rock music, management decided to make a change. On May 27, 1982, KXXY-FM flipped to country music and stunted by playing the song \\"You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma\\" for 24 hours. KXXY-FM became an aggressive country competitor to KEBC, which had been the leading FM country outlet since signing on in 1967. KXXY-FM edged ahead of KEBC in 1983 and would widen its lead to eight share points by the end of the decade. In 1992, it peaked at an 18.4 share, and it was the top-billing station in Oklahoma City every year from 1985 to 1998. However, the station slumped in the late 1990s and 2000s. In 1996, KXXY-FM was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-443 Clear Channel later switched its name to the current iHeartMedia, Inc.

Yuan was born in Xin'an, the capital of Quzhou prefecture, to an established gentry family. In the 1150s he was a student at the National University (Â§ßÂ≠¶) at the Southern Song capital of Hangzhou. After passing the jinshi degree in 1163, Yuan Cai served in several prefectures outside the capital. Altogether Yuan Cai served as magistrate of four counties. During this time, he spent much of his time writing. Two of his early works, Zhenghe za ji (\\"Mischellaneous Notes from Zhenghe) and Xianling xiao lu (\\"Minor Records of Magistrates\\"), are no longer extant. From the bibliography chapter of the Book of Song and Ming dynasty gazetteers of Quzhou, he is also known to have written a number of other books, all of which are also lost. Most of them were concerned with the administration of local and central government. At least one detailed ways in which the central government could improve its capacity to fend off the Jurchens who had seized north China in the Jin‚ÄìSong wars. Serving as magistrate of Yueqing from 1178 onwards, Yuan acted as compiler of a ten-chapter gazetteer of the county. He probably completed and published the Yuan shi shi fan around this time. Liu Zhen, one of the members of the local families, whom Yuan had met at the National University, wrote the preface for Yuan's work. The Yuan shi shi fan was reprinted in 1190, whilst Yuan Cai was at Wuyuan in what is now southern Anhui. In 1192 he was recommended for promotion by the poet Yang Wanli. Yuan Cai's last post was in the capital, as director of the Public Attention Drum Bureau. He probably died sometime in the mid-1190s. After his death, his second son and a cousin also attained the jinshi degree in 1205.

Born in Roccaspinalveti, Italy, he was educated at the Accademia di San Luca of Rome. Life and career Piccirilli came to the United States in 1888 and worked for his father and then with the Piccirilli Brothers as a sculptor, modeler and stone carver at their studio in the Bronx, New York City, at 467 East 142nd Street. This location is now a vacant lot. As artist in his own right, he is the author of the Maine Memorial in Columbus Circle, at the entrance to Central Park in Manhattan.. One of the groups that he created for this monument was also used for his mother's memorial at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx Also in New York he created a pediment and other sculptural details for the Frick Mansion on 5th Avenue and the Firemen's Memorial, a group of figures in Riverside Park. As Piccirilli gained fame, he became invaluable to many American sculptors. Before Piccirilli and his family arrived in America, many American artists were forced to travel to Italy to have their models carved into stone. In the case of Attilio, if an artist presented him with small plaster model, Attilio could create a marble replica to any size. In fact, the vast majority of Attilio's works were designed by other artists. Fragilina is one of the view works that was designed and sculpted into marble by Attilio himself. Piccirilli's most famous work is the creation of the Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, which was originally designed by Daniel Chester French. Attilio and his family collaborated with Paul Eartlett, Frederick MacMonnies, Hermon MacNeil, Massey Rhind, Karl Bitter, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Olin Warner, Lorado Taft, Charles Niehaus, and Andrew O'Connor. Piccirrili also did architectural work for Cass Gilbert, Henry Bacon, McKim, Mead, and White, Carr√©re, and Hastings.Tolles, p.214. Attilio's most famous works that which he designed and sculpted are the Maine Monument in Central Park, New York and the Fireman's Monument on Riverside Drive, New York. He also designed a Monument to Guglielmo Marconi (1941) in Washington DC. Piccirilli became a member of the National Academy of Design and the Architectural League. He won numerous prizes including a Gold Medal at the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Attilio also helped create the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in New York City, New York. Its purpose was to give affordable training in art, like sculpture, to New York's poor. Piccirilli's 1935 Pyrex glass relief sculpture Advance Forever, Eternal Youth over the entrance of the Palazzo d'Italia at Rockefeller Center was removed during World War Two when the Italian inscriptions were used by Mussolini, and it was associated with fascist iconography. It disappeared from storage some years afterwards. Piccirilli is represented in the sculpture collection at Brookgreen Gardens. His work is also found in museums around the United States. White marble \\"Fragilina\\" now stands in the newly re-arranged American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He died in New York City in 1945. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

The original is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York. It is 48 ¬Ω inches by 15 ¬Ω inches by 25 inches. It is completely made of marble. Piccirilli also made five additional smaller copies, one of which is in the Muscarelle Museum of Art at the College of William and Mary.Forte, p.13. \\"Fragilina\\" in Italian means \\"the little delicate one.\\" Fragilina is part of a series of female nudes that Attilio sculpted, beginning with \\"A Soul\\" in 1909. The woman in Fragilina is almost identical in pose to the woman in \\"A Soul.\\" Though, in Fragilina, more marble is cut away to leave a freer, fluid, and abstract work. Going with the theme of the work being abstract, many art critics criticize the oval-shaped head that gives less definition to the hair and face. Some say, \\"the eyes appear almost veiled in stone.\\" When discussing Fragilina, Piccirilli said, \\"Every person has his own ideal of beauty stored away in his subconscious mind. When facial characteristics are precisely delineated, the observer is denied the opportunity of personally visualizing his ideal type. This reaction frequently takes place without full realization.\\"Gardner, p.95. So, as can be seen with Fragilina and his subsequent works, it can be said he was a minimalist. Piccirilli was described impeccably in the book, Attilio Piccirilli: Life of an American Sculptor, by Josef Vincent Lombardo. Lombardo writes, \\"Piccirilli's art stands out boldly for its discipline, simplicity, and dignity.... His sculpture was and is simply tailored, free from adventitious detail and superficiality... Piccirilli's style is distinctly personal and highly selective. Simplicity is his gospel, restraint his creed.\\" Fragilina was one of five works Piccirilli showed at the exhibit at the National Sculpture Society in New York in 1923.National Sculpture Society, Exhibition of American Sculpture Catalogue, 156th Street of Broadway New York, The National Sculpture Society 1923 p. 341 It was also exhibited at the National Academy of Design commemorative exhibition in 1925. Piccirilli also made smaller versions of Fragilina, including two bronze casts. One of which is at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

It opened in 2007. History The resort was constructed in 2005 and originally scheduled to open on September 1 of that year. However, days before the scheduled grand opening, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, destroying the casino and damaging the resort. Reconstruction and reopening of the property was in limbo for a time because of a legal dispute between owner Premier Entertainment and the trustee for bondholders on the property. Premier later began architectural work on a newly rebuilt facility, awaiting resolution of the dispute, prior to workers securing the property for the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Rebuilding of the facility was completed, and the casino opened to the public on June 30, 2007. Kid Rock opened the hotel on July 7, 2007. Other concert performances in the first month of business included 3 Doors Down, Poison, Ratt, and Cheap Trick. In 2014, Twin River Worldwide Holdings bought the property from Leucadia National for $250 million. Twin River had sought to diversify itself geographically because its Rhode Island casino faced an increase in competition from casinos to be built in Massachusetts. Features The casino's exterior at night The newly restored facility is built on \\"more storm resistant\\" cement pilings rather than the former floating barge as originally mandated by Mississippi law, and features seven restaurants, including a Hard Rock Cafe, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Half Shell Oysters House, close to 500 hotel rooms and suites, a full service spa, a nightclub, over 1400 slot machines, 56 table games, outdoor beach themed pool with cabanas and swim-up bar, and a Hard Rock Live performance arena. (The poker room was closes Labor Day Weekend, 2016.) The height of the hotel is Steelman Partners was the architect, and interior designers and shop12 was the lighting designers The guitar sign on the property is a replica of a Peavey HP Signature and is tall - at the time of its construction, it was the tallest Hard Rock sign in the world. It survived the wrath of Hurricane Katrina largely intact, and was restored and repaired during the property's reconstruction. Memorabilia Among other memorabilia that was found by local residents and returned to the Hard Rock after Katrina was Elvis Presley's Army uniform , found on a mannequin floating in the Mississippi Sound.

The store's concept was founded on serving a variety of coffee from all over the world and roasting it in Denver. It was categorized in a menu format called the \\"Peaberry Profile System\\". The system offered four selections of coffee roasting styles, Light & Mild, Rich & Creamy, Extravagant & Exotic and Dark & Intense. In 2006, a lawsuit was brought against Peaberry Coffee and Perkins Coie (Peaberry's franchise attorneys). Ten franchisees claimed to have lost millions of dollars due to Peaberry's poor financial practices and alleged that the company had not shown a profit since 1998. They further claimed that most of the stores owned by the company failed to break even. The franchisees also stopped paying royalties in February 2008. A Denver district judge ruled against the franchisees later that year and also decided that they owed the unpaid royalties to Peaberry. The franchisees are appealing the ruling. In September 2009, Peaberry Coffee, Inc. closed all of its corporate owned locations. Several stores which were previously franchises are now operated independently. These stores include: the Denver Tech Center location, the Park Meadows location, the Arapahoe location, and the Boulder location. The closures were due to poor financial performance from the stores, a poor economy, and the cost of the lawsuit brought against the company by franchisees. In February 2010, the Colorado Court of Appeals vacated judgment against Plaintiffs for unpaid royalties, attorneys fees and restored the fraudulent concealment claim against Peaberry. On remand in 2011, the trial court again ruled in Peaberry's favor and resolved the inconsistencies concerning the fraudulent concealment claim the Colorado Court of Appeals noted in its first ruling. The franchisees appealed again, and on July 26, 2012, the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling for Peaberry concluding that Plaintiffs failed to prove Peaberry defrauded them. The store was named after the peaberry coffee bean. A \\"peaberry\\" is a small, round coffee bean that has unique taste characteristics and makes up only 2-4% of the harvest depending on the crop.

In 2006, Domenech was hired as a blogger by The Washington Post, but resigned three days later after verified plagiarism in prior work. Early life Domenech was born in Jackson, South Carolina and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. Domenech's career in punditry began as a teenager when he began a column, \\"Any Given Sunday\\", for National Review Online (NRO), in addition to his personal blog.

The Post profile noted: \\"An aspiring government major, Domenech said he is uninterested in holding elective office, going to law school or becoming a policy wonk.

Domenech argued on the podcast that smokers are more likely to die earlier than other people, and thus are less costly to insurance companies and the government.Benjamin Domenech. \\"Smokers under Obamacare\\". Heartland podcast, Feb. 7, 2013.\\"Big Tobacco, anti-smoking advocates agree Obamacare‚Äôs smoker surcharge must go \\". Bangor Daily News, Feb. 19, 2013. Domenech also began to post, around this same period of time, regularly on RedState and began his own personal blog, \\"this is an adventure\\". In September, 2013, Domenech, along with Luke Sherman and Sean Davis co-founded The Federalist; senior editors include David Harsanyi and Mollie Hemingway. Domenech said at the time that The Federalist was inspired by the mission and worldview of the original Time Magazine's editor, Henry Luce, which he described as, \\"[leaning] to the political right, with a small-c conservatism equipped with a populist respect for the middle class reader outside of New York and Washington, and an abiding love for America at a time when snark and cynicism were not considered substitutes for smart analysis.\\" The Federalist is owned by a private company and thus doesn't have to disclose the identities of any of its financial backers. BuzzFeed News has reported that the website's funding has prompted \\"a considerable amount of speculation in the political media world.\\" BuzzFeed News pointed out that \\"the Federalist has been resolutely opaque about its finances. The site is owned by a private company and doesn't have to disclose its ownership or funding structure; its parent company, FDRLST Media, was incorporated as a limited liability company in Delaware in 2016.\\" In Politico, Reid Cherlin wrote in 2014 that The Federalist deserved praise for \\"seek[ing] to go deep on the issues and sway the conversation in Washington.\\" Matt K. Lewis wrote in The Week that conservative online media was divided between \\"staid, august publications\\" and \\"a new generation of irreverent sites,\\" and that \\"[s]ites like The Federalist try to bridge the gap by providing serious commentary that is typically written by young, pop culture‚Äìsavvy writers.\\" In Bloomberg Politics, political writer Dave Weigel favorably noted that The Federalist frequently criticizes left- leaning publications, but was also founded with the intention of being \\"a source of original interviews and real-time arguments between conservatives and libertarians.\\" In May 2018, Damon Linker of The Week described The Federalist as \\"a leading diseminator of pro-Trump conspiracies and up-is-down, funhouse-mirror distortions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump involvement.\\" Further commenting on The Federalist, Linker wrote: \\"It is only since the election that rabid Republican partisans in the administration, in Congress, and in the media have actively dispensed with such old-fashioned norms of public life like concerns for propriety, professionalism, and fair-mindedness ‚Äî all in the effort to protect a thoroughly compromised president from having to face the legal scrutiny his personal behavior and business transactions rightly prompt. In this respect at least, The Federalist is a website at the vanguard of a thoroughly Trumpified Republican Party.\\" In August, 2020, Jeremy Peters of the New York Times wrote that under Domenech: \\"The Federalist has been one of the biggest breakouts... diving headfirst into the culture wars... Its pieces have questioned the Me Too movement... and called the effort to recognize transgender identity a ‚Äúwar on women.‚Äù Peters wrote that Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor of the Federalist, is \\"one of Mr. Trump's favorites.. Her pieces... have earned presidential retweets and affirmation for their scathing criticism of Democrats and the news media, whom she accuses of lying about just about everything when it comes to the president. Recently she claimed that journalists had fabricated reports about tear gas and the excessive use of force against protesters outside the White House (law enforcement, in fact, has acknowledged shooting a pepper-based irritant into the crowd).\\" Domenech, Hemmingway, and other staff for the Federalist \\"offer an outlet for outrage against those the president has declared his enemies, often by reducing them to a culture war caricature of liberalism.\\"Jeremy Peters. \\"These Conservatives Have a Laser Focus: ‚ÄòOwning the Libs‚Äô\\". The New York Times, August 3, 2020. In late June 2020, Domenech was granted an exclusive Oval Office interview with President Trump. During the interview, Trump disclosed that he expected to soon be banned by Twitter. Domenech reported that \\"the president believes the ban from the popular platform will happen in the fall before the 2020 election, an opinion shared by others in the White House.\\" More than two months later, Twitter did not ban Trump, and there have been no indications they might do so. Trump also questioned the loyalty and patriotism of his political adversaries: \\"I do wonder sometimes if Democrats love our country,‚Äù Trump told Domenech, ‚ÄúMaybe 44 percent of liberals, but I assure you there‚Äôs a lot more the other way.‚ÄùBen Domenech. \\"Trump Calls For Tougher Republican Response To ‚ÄòPolitical War‚Äô\\". The Federalist, June 27, 2020. Personal life Ben Domenech is the son of Douglas Domenech, who served as the Interior Department's White House Liaison and the Interior Secretary's Deputy Chief of Staff. During the administration of President Donald Trump, Douglas Domenech has served as the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular and International Affairs. Domenech‚Äôs sister, Emily Domenech, currently serves as Senior Policy Advisor for Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Her husband, Ryan Jackson, was Chief of Staff to the Administrator of the EPA. Ben Domenech became engaged in July 2017 to Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late U.S. Senator John McCain. They were married on November 21, 2017. He was previously married to Christine Barton.  Controversies = Plagiarism  In early 2006, Domenech was hired by the Washington Post's online arm to write a blog providing \\"a daily mix of commentary, analysis and cultural criticism\\". Media Matters for America criticized the choice, claiming that \\"[t]here [were], however, no progressive bloggers‚Äîand no one left of center with the credentials of a political operative‚Äîon washingtonpost.com to provide balance to Domenech.\\" Instapundit founder Glenn Reynolds told The New York Times that Domenech's appointment attracted anger among liberals \\"because he was a conservative and he was given real estate at The Washington Post\\" and this spurred bloggers to find \\"something they could use to get rid of him,\\" referring to disclosures only days after Domenech's appointment of his extensive plagiarism. Red America launched on March 21, 2006, but Domenech resigned three days later after having written only six posts, after his fellow bloggers posted evidence online that Domenech had plagiarized the work of other journalists from The Washington Post, The New Yorker, National Review, the humorist P. J. O'Rourke, the film critic Stephanie Zacharek, the writer, Mary Elizabeth Williams, and that of several other publications and writers. O'Rourke denied Domenech's claim that the humorist had granted permission to use his words: \\"I wouldn't want to swear in a court of law that I never met the guy\\", O'Rourke told The New York Times, \\"but I didn't give him permission to use my words under his byline, no.\\" Editors for Domenech's college newspaper, The Flat Hat, denied allegations by Domenech that one instance of plagiarism resulted from his editors having \\"inserted a passage from The New Yorker in an article without his knowledge,\\" saying that \\"Mr. Domenech's actions, if true, [were] deeply offensive.\\" In another instance, Domenech has plagiarized from a front-page article in The Washington Post, the very newspaper he was now going to work for. On March 24, 2006, the editors of The National Review confirmed on its blog The Corner that Domenech appeared to have plagiarized for at least one article he had written for that publication. Demands for Domenech's resignation were immediate and came not only came from liberal and progressive writers and bloggers, but also many conservatives who had been previously supportive. Michelle Malkin, who published a book edited by Domenech, wrote: :I cheered for Ben, the editor of my last book at Regnery, when he announced his new position. I criticized unhinged bloggers on the Left who leveled vicious ad hominem attacks against him. :But now the determined moonbat hordes have exposed multiple instances of what clearly appear to me to be blatant lifting of entire, unique passages by Ben from other writers. It is one thing to paraphrase basic facts from a wire story. But to filch the original thoughts and distinctly crafted phrases of a writer without crediting him/her‚Äìand doing so repeatedly‚Äìis unacceptable in our business.Michelle Malkin. \\"\\"The Domenech Debacle\\". The Unz Review, March 24, 2026. The Washington Post online editor Jim Brady announced Domenech's resignation saying \\"[a]n investigation into these allegations [of plagiarism] was ongoing, and in the interim, Domenech has resigned, effective immediately.\\" After initially denying that he had plagiarized, Domenech apologized, writing in a RedState post entitled \\"Contrition,\\" that \\"[t]here is no excuse for this.... I hope that nothing I've done as a teenager or in my professional life will reflect badly on the movement and principles I believe in... I'm a young man, and I hope that in time that I can earn a measure of the respect that you have given me.\\" Only days earlier, Domenech addressed his detractors, upset by his plagiarism, defiantly, writing in a blog post: \\"To my enemies: I take enormous solace in the fact that you spent this week bashing me, instead of America.\\"  Payments from Foreign Agent  In 2013, Domenech was implicated in a journalism scandal that resulted in the removal of his work from The Washington Examiner and The Huffington Post after it was disclosed that he had received $36,000 from Joshua Trevino, a conservative pundit and lobbyist, in exchange for writing favorable opinion pieces about the government of Malaysia without disclosing the financial relationship. The payments only came to light when Trevino registered as a foreign agent of the Malaysian government, and disclosed that Domenech was one of several young conservative writers he paid to write articles favorable to the Malaysian regime to bolster its image in conservative media. After disclosure of the payments, The Washington Examiner and The San Francisco Examiner removed Domenech's posts from their respective websites and replaced it with an editors' note saying that \\"the author of this item presented content for which, unbeknownst to us, and in violation of our standards, had received payment from a third party mentioned therein‚Äîa payment which he also failed to disclose.\\" The Washington Examiner owned The San Francisco Examiner at the time and thus shared content. Buzzfeed reported at the time that the Malaysian government desired to bolster their public image because the regime had \\"been accused of multiple human rights abuses and restricting the press and personal freedoms. Anwar, the opposition leader, has faced prosecution for sodomy, a prosecution widely denounced in the West, which Trevino defended as more 'nuanced' than American observers realized.\\" Domenech explained his actions at the time by saying that Trevino \\"did not ever have anyone looking over my shoulder for what I wrote, and the guidance really was just to write about the political fray there and give my own opinion. Of course, Josh picked me knowing what my opinion was ‚Äî I stand by what I wrote at the time.\\" Labor law violation In 2019, following staff of other American media companies unionizing, co-founder Domenech tweeted \\"first one of you tries to unionize I swear I'll send you back to the salt mine\\". In 2020, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that Domenech had threatened staff illegally and required the company to post notices in its offices and email employees to inform them about their legal rights. Domenech argued unsuccessfully that the tweet was a joke. But the NLRB judge ruled: \\"In viewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding the tweet, this tweet had no other purpose except to threaten...Federalist employees with unspecified reprisal, as the underlying meaning of ‚Äòsalt mine‚Äô so signifies.\\" The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting what it regards as an excessive administrative state, and which had been representing The Federalist pro bono, announced that the they would appeal. Reason and National Review have published articles questioning the judge's decision.  Other controversies  Domenech was caught at least once for allegedly fabricating a quote. A June 20, 2002, Spinsanity.org entry demonstrated that Domenech made up a quote he attributed to Tim Russert in order to defend President Bush. In a 2010 post written for CBS, Domenech wrongly described Supreme Court Justice nominee Elena Kagan as potentially the \\"first openly gay justice.\\" Dan Farber, editor in chief of CBSNews.com, later said in a statement that \\"after looking at the facts we determined that it was nothing but pure and irresponsible speculation on the blogger's part.\\"Howard Kurtz. \\"White House complains about CBS News blog post saying that possible Supreme Court nominee is gay\\".vThe Washington Post,April 16, 2010. Domenech said in an addendum to his column, \\"I have to correct my text here to say that Kagan is apparently still closeted‚Äîodd, because her female partner is rather well known in Harvard circles.\\" In fact, however, numerous reports confirmed that Kagan was not gay, forcing Domenech to issue a public apology to Kagan \\"if she is offended at all by my repetition of a Harvard rumor in a speculative blog post.\\" In November 2017, The Federalist, the publication of which Domenech is a co-founder and publisher, came under criticism from both conservatives and liberals for publishing an opinion piece by Tully Borland, an Ouachita Baptist University philosopher, defending Roy Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice, and then Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, for dating teenagers, some as young as fourteen years old, while Moore himself was in his late 30s, arguing that such behavior was \\"not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family.\\" In the subtitle of the article, Borland said that he himself had \\"a 14-year old daughter\\", and if he \\"caught Roy Moore doing what was alleged\\" to his own daughter, he would physically harm him. \\"That said,\\" Borland continued, \\"I don't think it's wrong to vote for Moore.\\" Borland also quoted another philosophy professor as telling him that when Moore pursued relationships with the young girls It was a \\"different time\\" and that she was \\"sick to death of people imposing their own moral standards on people\\" by contemporary standards of things they did in the past. Noah Rothman of the conservative Commentary Magazine stated that the op-ed was \\"rationalizing away child molestation\\" while \\"preening self-righteous in the process. Molly Roberts of the Washington Post wrote that the op-ed was \\"uniquely awful\\" and advocated \\"moral bankruptcy\\" Domenech defended The Federalist for publishing Borland's op-ed saying the magazine \\"remains avowedly committed to offering alternative views. For those that have a problem with this, the question is simple: what are you afraid of?\\" The New York Times has since reported that one of the Federalist's largest, secret funders had been Dick Uihlein, a \\"Midwestern packing supply magnate and Trump donor\\" who has also financed Moore's Senate campaign.Jeremy Peters. \\"These Conservatives Have a Laser Focus: ‚ÄòOwning the Libs‚Äô\\". The New York Times, August 3, 2020. On February 21, 2018, Domenech sparked outrage after he called survivors of one of the worst mass shootings in the nation's history. at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a \\"bunch of idiots\\". In July 2018, on the day that the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election indicted 12 Russian agents, Domenech disseminated information from a hoax version of the indictment documents. Domenech falsely reported that \\"much of it [the indictment] is taken up by the numbers of times that people were posting memes on the internet,\\" citing the fake indictment, which claimed that the 12 Russians charged had only engaged in insignificant \\"shitposting\\" and the use of memes. In May 2019, Domenech's wife Meghan McCain appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where she and Meyers discussed McCain's highly accusation that Rep. Ilhan Omar was anti-Semitic. Shortly thereafter, Domenech posted a number of crude tweets targeting Meyers, calling Meyers an \\"untalented piece of shit\\" and \\"monumental asshole\\" who \\"only has his job because he regularly gargled Lorne Michaels‚Äô balls.\\" The Daily Beast described Domenech's behavior as him having gone \\"on an unhinged rant agsinst the late- night host... that was at times homophobic.\\" Domenech later deleted his tweets and apologized for \\"rage tweeting\\". During the coronavirus pandemic, The Federalist published numerous articles, many of them written by Domenech himself, that contained false information or information that was contrary to the recommendations of public health experts and authorities. The Federalist published articles denouncing social distancing, and others claiming that fears over the coronavirus pandemic had been overhyped by the Democratic Party and the media. The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis wrote that Democrats were intentionally trying to \\"destroy the economy\\" as a ‚Äúlast-ditch 2020 play‚Äù because \\"all they care about is power. And if they have to destroy your life and business to get power back, they will.\\" Domenech also published a piece, entitled ‚ÄúHow Medical ‚ÄòChickenpox Parties‚Äô Could Turn The Tide Of The Wuhan Virus,\\" by an individual identified as a physician in Oregon who recommended that people hold \\"chickenpox\\"-style parties for the coronavirus to build herd immunity, recommendations contrary to those of virtually all mainstream public health experts. \\"Given the recent example of spring break 2020 for college students in Florida, one could imagine such gatherings even becoming a social activity,\\" the author, Doug Perednia wrote. Pedrednia, a former dermatologist, had been a businessman for the past twenty five years, during which time he had not practiced medicine, and also allowed his medical license to lapse. The Federalist was subsequently temporarily suspended from Twitter because the website, Twitter said, had used its platform to promote fringe ideas that contradicted public health experts and were harmful to public health. In June 2020, Google Ads warned The Federalist that it was considering demonetizing the website because of racism in its comment section; The Federalist removed the comments Google objected to, and Google announced that \\"no action will be taken\\". In response, Domenech said: \\"We are really learning the degree to which Big Tech can be weaponized by woke mobs, or woke journalists in this case, to try to shut down places who disagree with their leftist agenda.\\"Kaplan, Talia. \\"Federalist's Ben Domenech: We're seeing how 'Big Tech can be weaponized by woke mobs'\\".

It was founded by a family of Russian circus performers who fled the turmoil of the 1919 Russian Civil War, arriving in the port of Manzanillo in 1923. The troupe consisted of Gregor Ivanoff, the father of the family, who Hispanicized his name to Gregorio Ivanova, his three daughters, his son-in-law Estanislao Shilinsky, a Lithuanian who wrote the material, and native Mexican performers. They set up their act in the Tacuba delegaci√≥n of Mexico City. In 1929, Mario Moreno \\"Cantinflas\\" joined the troupe. Shilinsky coached the comedian, then eighteen years of age, and helped him refine his style. Together, the two turned the Carpa Valentina into the hottest ticket in town. Moreno began courting Valentina Ivanova, the daughter for which the troupe was named, but her father never approved of the relationship and refused to increase the comic's salary despite his success. Fed up with the abuse, Moreno left the troupe, bringing his writer with him.

Its tendon goes to the index finger, which it extends. Structure It arises from the distal third of the dorsal part of the body of ulna and from the interosseous membrane. It runs through the fourth tendon compartment together with the extensor digitorum, from where it projects into the dorsal aponeurosis of the index finger. Opposite the head of the second metacarpal bone, it joins the ulnar side of the tendon of the extensor digitorum which belongs to the index finger. Like the extensor digiti minimi (i.e. the extensor of the little finger), the tendon of the extensor indicis runs and inserts on the ulnar side of the tendon of the common extensor digitorum. The extensor indicis lacks the juncturae tendinum interlinking the tendons of the extensor digitorum on the dorsal side of the hand.  Variation  The extensor indicis proprius does not show much variation. It exists as a single tendon most of the time. Double tendons of the extensor indicis proprius was also reported. It is known that the extensor indicis proprius inserts to the index finger on the ulnar side of the extensor digitorum. However, the insertion on the radial side of the common extensor digitorum infrequently seen, namely the extensor indicis radialis. Split tendons of the muscle inserting on both ulnar and the radial side of the common extensor digitorum was also reported. Anomalous hand extensors including the extensor medii proprius and the extensor indicis et medii communis are often seen as variations of the extensor indicis due to the shared characteristics and embryonic origin. Function The extensor indicis extends the index finger, and by its continued action assists in extending (dorsiflexion) the wrist and the midcarpal joints. Because the index finger and little finger have separate extensors, these fingers can be moved more independently than the other fingers.

Notable features Although low in elevation among the major mountains of Nepal, Api is exceptional in its rise above local terrain; the surrounding valleys are significantly lower than those surrounding most higher Himalayan peaks. Api peak's south face rises above its base. Climbing history The Api region was visited by Westerners in 1899, 1905 and 1936, but the peak was not attempted until 1953 on a visit by W. H. Murray a Scottish Mountaineer with John Tyson. This attempt was unsuccessful, as was another, by Italians, in 1954 which resulted in the death of two expedition members. The first ascent of Api occurred in 1960. The Doshisha Alpine Society of Japan successfully completed the Northwest Face route attempted by the 1954 party. In 1980 a British Army Mountaineering Association expedition made an attempt to climb the peak by the south face reaching within a few hundred metres of the summit. On 24 December 1983 Polish climbers Tadeusz Piotrowski and Andrzej Bielu≈Ñ made the first winter ascent. Bielu≈Ñ had reached the summit first alone but did not return to camp.

Listed at , 125 lb., she batted and threw left-handed. Career Born in Kaukauna, Wisconsin to Greek- American parents, Batikis was one of three descendants of Greek migrants to play in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, being the others Kay Lionikas and Vickie Panos. She had two brothers ‚Äì Alex (who served in the United States Navy from 1943‚Äì46) and John. She was first intrigued with playing baseball as a young girl in third grade while watching men play baseball on the playgrounds. When she got older she joined the Recreation Department League and played softball. She and her high school friends would go out to games where the Racine Belles played and watch in awe the women who played so well. At 18 years of age and in her senior year in high school, Batikis tried out at the Historic Horlick Field where the Belles played and made the cut. She was then sent to spring training in Chicago, where she got a contract with the Racine team of her home town. At that time only one other woman in the league played for her home town. She believed that playing ball gave her the opportunity to travel, meet all kinds of neat people - helped with self-confidence. Batikis played for one season because she left the following year to attend college at La Crosse, Wisconsin. She appeared in five games and went hitless in 11 at-bat opportunities. After her career as a professional baseball player ended, Batikis went on to get a teaching position, working in the educational department for 35 years. She did a significant amount of volunteer work for clubs, churches, ballteams, civic groups to give talks about the League she played in. She also attended Northwestern University. The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York since November 5, that honors those who were part of this unique experience. Batikis, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall. In 2002, Batikis was added to Milwaukees Walls of Honor, which salutes Wisconsin's baseball history greats. She is also in the Hall of Fame at her old college University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLaCrosse for being a pioneer for women in professional baseball. In addition, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Washington Park Hall High School in 1987, joining her brother John, who was inducted in 1976.

Closeup of the cliffsTip of Prince Leopold IslandPrince Leopold IslandFull view of Prince Leopold Island Conservation The island is a Canadian Important Bird Area (#NU006), a federally listed migratory bird sanctuary, and a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site (NU Site 15). Fauna Large numbers of thick-billed murres, northern fulmars and black-legged kittiwakes breed on the cliff ledges, arriving in the vicinity in May or early June and departing by mid- September. The island is the most important station for breeding marine birds in the Canadian Arctic, having larger numbers and a greater diversity of species than any other site. Intensive studies of the breeding seabirds were carried out in 1975-77 and in a dozen subsequent years, providing evidence of how ice conditions affect the breeding birds.

The show was performed on the side of a ski slope at the Sugarbush Resort in the town of North Fayston, located in Phish's home state of Vermont. It was the final concert of the band's highly successful 1994 summer tour. Earlier in the year, the band had released its highest selling album to date (Hoist) and the size of the Phish audience had expanded greatly by the summer. The Sugarbush concert, which included overnight camping on the ski slope under the stars, was slated as the grand finale of the tour. The concert's setlist included the standard high- energy favorites from 1994 plus a few surprises, including a rare performance of Mike Gordon's \\"N02\\", which appears on the band's 1986 self-titled debut album known as The White Tape (the band would not perform the song for another five years). During \\"Catapult\\" there is banter between Trey Anastasio and Jon Fishman after the line \\"there ain't gonna be no wedding\\" since Anastasio's wedding was set to occur soon. Also, during the middle of \\"Harpua\\", a giant comet could be seen overhead, prompting the band to launch into \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\", better known as the theme to 2001: A Space Odyssey and often simply referred to as \\"2001\\". Phish play Eumir Deodato's version of the song from the 1979 movie Being There with Peter Sellers. Deodato's version went platinum. This release reached a peak of #93 on the Billboard 200 chart.

At 6'0\\" (1.83 m)http://www.alicepanikian.com/biography/index.html Official website bio she is not only the tallest major national titleholder in Canadian history, but also had earned a significant amount of attention from the world press as one of the strongest candidates to succeed to then-reigning Miss Universe, Natalie Glebova, also from Canada. As no country has ever won the title back-to-back (later achieved by Dayana Mendoza and Stefan√≠a Fern√°ndez in 2009, both of them from Venezuela), Panikian had a significant historical hurdle to jump despite many pundits who argue that she was an even stronger candidate than her predecessor. Alice did not become Miss Universe 2006 (that honour went to Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico), but she did finish in 6th place. She is the last Canadian presentative to place at the Miss Universe until 2016. Alice enjoys writing short stories, and her hobbies include volleyball and yoga. Panikian is of Bulgarian and Armenian ancestry, which comes through her paternal grandfather and accounts for her Armenian surname. She came to Canada with her parents when she was five years old. Panikian studied at York University and majored in English and Communications. She studied broadcast journalism and resides in Toronto, Ontario, and aspires to be a journalist or a TV show host. Before becoming Miss Universe Canada, Alice represented Canada at the 2006 Reinado Internacional del Caf√© or International Queen of Coffee pageant, held in Manizales, Colombia on January 9, where she became the first Canadian winner in the history of the pageant.

It is the 31st highest mountain in the world, but it is in a very remote location deep in the Karakoram. It is located on the Actual Ground Position Line between Indian controlled territory in the Siachen region and Pakistani controlled territory west of the Saltoro Range.  Climbing history  The mountain was reconnoitered by the intrepid Workman couple in 1911-12. The first attempt on the peak was in 1935 by a British expedition led by J. Waller, which reached c.24500' on the SE ridge. A British university expedition led by Eric Shipton approached this peak through the Bilafond La via Pakistan with a Pakistani climbing permit. They reached the peak but did not attempt it. This expedition was inadvertently the first move in the deadly game of Siachen oropolitics that would lead to the Siachen conflict of 1984. The first ascent of Saltoro Kangri was in July 1962, by a joint Japanese-Pakistani expedition led by T. Shidei. This piggyback expedition put A. Saito, Y. Takamura and Pakistani climber R.A. Bashir on top on July 24, following the S.E. ridge route. This peak was climbed by an Indian Army expedition led by Colonel Narendra Kumar in 1981. US maps of the area and many world atlases starting in the 1960s showed the Line of Control between Pakistani and Indian territory running from the last defined point in the 1949 Karachi Agreement, NJ9842, east-northeast to the Karakoram Pass, thus putting the whole of Saltoro Kangri and the entire Siachen Glacier in Pakistan. However, the Simla Agreement defined the Line of Control no further than point NJ9842 other than with the phrase \\"thence north to the glaciers.\\" The Himalayan Index lists only one more ascent of the mountain, in 1981, and no other attempts.

The stations are licensed to Troy University, on whose main campus the studios are located. Three stations comprise the network: History WTSU-FM started broadcasting on March 1, 1977 as the state's third public radio station (the callsign stands for the university's name then, \\"Troy State University,\\"), and the first south of Birmingham. WTSU originally broadcast at 90.1 MHz with a power of 50,000 watts; by 1981, it moved to its present frequency of 89.9, doubling its wattage to 100,000. Programming from the start was a blend of NPR news and classical music, combined with an automated block of \\"beautiful music\\" between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. TUPR discontinued the easy-listening daytime format in 1993 in favor of then-more conventional classical programming. The station would expand its service area to all of southeastern Alabama in the 1980s, adding the frequencies in Columbus in 1984 and Dothan in 1986. On January 1, 2000, TUPR began broadcasting 24 hours per day. Public Radio is one component of Troy University's Broadcast and Digital Network; the other is \\"TrojanVision\\", a student-operated television channel seen on several cable systems throughout southeastern Alabama. The Broadcast and Digital Network enlist students from the Hall School of Journalism as staffers. TUPR set a tentative date of May 2010 to begin streaming all three HD channels.

Its transmitter is located in Northeast Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and studios are located at the 50 Penn Place building on the Northwest side. History The station went on the air with a MOR format as KFNB (K First National Bank) transmitting from their bank building top downtown in 1962. The station switched calls to KLTE and became adult contemporary \\"Lite Rock 102\\" in 1979. Although it was, for a time, the only AC station in OKC, Lite Rock 102 struggled to catch on. After KOFM 104.1 shocked the market and abandoned its successful CHR format for AC as Magic 104, Lite Rock 102 would usually be the lowest rated Class C FM in the market. Lite Rock 102 tried several different experiments to boost ratings, including jazz in the afterhours and oldies on the weekends, but none brought it much success. The station switched formats to oldies and became \\"K-Lite 102\\" in August 1989. On January 2, 1991 at 9:00 PM during Jamie Lee's airshift, the station announced it was changing call letters to KOQL and would become known as \\"Kool 102.\\" The oldies format was fairly successful, but Entercom announced just before Thanksgiving 1993 that KOQL would be the first station it would sell in roughly 20 years. Newmarket Communications, owner of country KXXY 1340/96.1, would purchase the station and begin operating it immediately in an LMA. The future was easy to predict as Newmarket had just acquired a second station with the same format in New Orleans to pair with its country WNOE 101.1 and flipped it to a second country station. By Christmas 1993, KOQL would be the home of \\"Non-stop, full tilt rockin' country,\\" 101.9 The Twister. The call letters changed to KTST on March 11, 1994 when the FCC approved of the license transfer from Entercom to Newmarket. Newmarket announced it would be selling to Radio Equity Partners shortly after taking over The Twister, and Radio Equity Partners became one of the first major Clear Channel acquisitions after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed. The result was a bigger cluster at 50 Penn Place, including KTOK 1000, KXXY 1340/96.1, KJYO 102.7, KEBC 94.7 and KTST 101.9. For a brief time, Clear Channel also operated Gaylord's WKY 930 alongside its OKC cluster.

It was produced from a lost original painting by Francesco Francia. Giovanni Filoteo Achillini (Latin Joannes Philotheus Achillinus; 1466‚Äì1538) was an Italian philosopher. Born in Bologna, he was the younger brother of philosopher Alessandro. He applied himself to Greek, Latin, theology, philosophy, music, antiquities, jurisprudence, poetry, etc., but did not excel in any specific field. His poetry is the most noteworthy of his work; written in what has since been considered the bad taste that prevailed at the end of the 15th century, however, his works have left scarcely any memory of their existence but their titles. One of the principal was titled Viridario and contained the eulogy of many of his contemporaries in literature, with lessons of morality. He also wrote some remarks on Italian to the disparagement of Tuscan, and the praise of Bolognese, which he had used in his poems. Of antiquities, he had accumulated ample collections.

It is the only liturgical book that was written before the Moorish invasion and is the only surviving Visigothic manuscript containing figural decoration. The manuscript has 127 folios that measure 330 mm by 260 mm. The text was written in Visigothic minuscule. A marginal gloss indicated that the manuscript was produced in Tarragona, at the church of Saint Fructuosus. The orational contains antiphons and responsories that are not neumed; no music exists in the codex. On folio 3r there is a drawing of the \\"Rose of the Winds\\", a precursor of the Compass rose. The drawing depicts the twelve winds grouped around a central cross. The twelve winds are represented by four heads with three faces each that have trumpets coming out of the mouth of each face. Each head is contained within a circle and the four circles are arranged in a cross pattern around the central cross. The entire drawing is enclosed within a double circle. Although the drawing has been Christianized by the addition of the central cross, the drawing is based a well known formula in Classical art, the Vultus trifons. This manuscript is also important because it contains the first written sample of an early Italian language different from Late Latin.

Listed at , , she batted and threw left-handed. Early life Peppas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As a student she was always involved in athletics, predominantly underhand fast pitch softball. She graduated from Elmhurst High School in 1947, and from 1942 to 1947 played for a championship team sponsored by Harold Greiner, owner of the Bob-Inn Restaurant in Fort Wayne. The team won state titles in 1944 and 1945, while Greiner, who scouted for the All-American Professional Baseball League, recommended Peppas for the league's tryouts. She received contract offers from a professional softball league and the AAGPBL, but decided to join the All-Americans. She had a mother who had a bad cold all the time and had to use the money she earned to take care of her and a young brother George Demetrious Peppas Jr. AAGPBL career In 1948, Peppas attended to spring training at Opa-locka, Florida and was assigned to the Fort Wayne Daisies, playing for them one and a half year before joining the Racine Belles (1949‚Äì50), Battle Creek Belles (1951) and Kalamazoo Lassies (1951‚Äì54). She spent most of her time at first base and pitching, eventually appearing at outfield. According to the new league's regulations, Peppas had to make the transition from underhand to overhand pitching. Her unfamiliarity with the style and the ball size caused her negative results. In her rookie season, Peppas posted a 4‚Äì12 record with 39 strikeouts and 91 walks in 113 innings for the Daisies, including a 4.62 ERA which ranked her near last place between the league pitchers. Nevertheless, she still had a respectable .264 batting average. In 1949, she played more games at first base and overcame her pitching control problems, going 3‚Äì4 with a 2.25 ERA while hitting .150 in 50 games, though she was bothered by two knee injuries. In 1950, once Peppas overcame her injuries, her career blossomed. She hit .268 with a career-high 52 runs batted in, including 11 doubles, five triples, and four home runs. As a pitcher, she had a decent 4‚Äì4 record with a 4.57 ERA. But her control problems returned, as she walked more hitters than she struck out in 1950 (41-to-20) and 1951 (31-to-20). Her most productive seasons came with the Lassies, when she was selected at first base for the All-Star Team in 1953 and 1954, even though she often pitched. From 1952 to 1953, Peppas improved her batting averages from .262 to .271. In 1954 she drove in 54 runs and posted career-numbers with a .333 average, 16 home runs, and her only pitching winning season with a 6‚Äì4 record and a 3.32 ERA in 13 appearances. Her .333 average was a team‚Äôs best and the league‚Äôs fifth highest mark for players who played at least 80 games. When Kalamazoo had to face the Fort Wayne Daisies for the AAGPBL Championship Title, Peppas came through with a stellar performance. 1954 Championship Title In Game 1 of the AAGPBL Series, the Lassies defeated the Daisies 17‚Äì9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from Peppas, who also helped herself by hitiing 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben, Fern Shollenberger and Chris Ballingall, who hit a grand slam, also slugged one each. Katie Horstman connected on two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, and her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one. Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18‚Äì7 record with 3.23 ERA during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss. The Daisies evened the Series against the Lassies winning Game 2, 11‚Äì4, after hitting five home runs off two pitchers. Horstman started the feat with a two- run home run to open the score in the first inning. In the rest of the game, Betty Weaver Foss added two homers with five RBI, while her sister Joanne and Geissinger added solo shots. Nancy Mudge and Dorothy Schroeder homered for Kalamazoo, while Peppas, who played first base, hit a solo homer in three at- bats. In Game 3, the Daisies defeated the Lassies, 8‚Äì7, fueled again by a heavy hitting by Joanne Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs. Peppas went 1-for-4 to spark a seventh inning three-run rally, but Fort Wayne came back in the bottom of the inning with two two runs that marked the difference. In another close score, the Lassies evened the Series in Game 4 with a victory over the Daisies, 6‚Äì5, behind a strong pitching effort by Gloria Cordes, who hurled a complete game. Peppas contributed with a single, a double and one RBI in four at-bats. In decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3-for-5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8‚Äì5 margin to give the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Mary Taylor (5-for-5), Balingall (3-for-4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eight. Peppas finished with a .450 average and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the league's history. Personal life Following her AAGPBL career, Peppas earned bachelor's and master's degrees in arts from the Western Michigan University during the late 1960s. She later taught vocational-education graphic arts and operated her own printing business, retiring in 1988. Since 1980, Peppas and a group of friends began assembling a list of names and addresses of former AAGPBL players. Her work turned into a newsletter that resulted in the league‚Äôs first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998. June Peppas died on March 14, 2016 in Stuart, Florida. She is survived by a brother George Demetrious Peppas Jr. and his wife Linda Marie Peppas and their 3 children, Angela Janette Littrell, Khristina Michelle Lee Hoch and George Demetrious Peppas III in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Facts * The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York since November 5, 1988 that honors those who were part of this unique experience. Peppas, along with the rest of the league's girls, is included at the display/exhibit. * The AAGPBL Players Association helped to bring the league story to the public eye. The association was largely responsible for the opening of the aforementioned exhibition. As it is said, all began with the newsletter published by Peppas in 1980. Of the approximately 560 women who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others; at least not until the first reunion held in Chicago two years later. *A League of Their Own is a 1992 film about the first season of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her film includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. A League of Their Own itself was inspired by the 1987 documentary of the same title, written and produced by Kelly Candaele, one of the five sons of Helen Callaghan, who in 1945 won the AAGPBL batting championship with a .299 average. Like many of her colleagues, Peppas was relatively unknown until the Marshall's film was exhibited for the first time. Sources *All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C.

It has an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres. The island has been a nature reserve since 1957 and is administered jointly by the National Parks and Conservation Service and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation.  Round Island restoration project  Round Island represents one of the longest-running island restoration projects in the world, having been designated a nature reserve in 1957 through the work of the then Colonial Secretary, Robert Newton (a \\"keen bird-watcher\\"), and several others who realized the nesting birds faced a direct threat from people - mainly fishermen who would catch them for food. Many of the biological records supporting conservation status and subsequent work were taken by Jean Vinson O. B. E., a Mauritian zoologist and Director of the Mauritius Institute, who conducted a field survey of Round Island as early as 1948 that provided \\"...the first serious report on its fauna since 1869\\". Round Island was visited again in 1952, 1954, and 1957 for further field surveys, showing stable (albeit low) vegetation populations despite the goats and rabbits (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810). In 1963, Vinson returned to Round Island but was shocked to find that the cyclones of 1960 and 1962 had severely reduced the number of palms and screw-pines on the island; many plant species had been \\"practically decimated\\". Vinson realized the island's tree populations were unstable after the unusually frequent cyclones, and this was exacerbated by the introduced goats and rabbits that grazed on the new growth, which would have replaced the fallen trees. Without the trees to populate and cover the land, Round Island's top soil could easily be eroded by wind or rain, effectively making it an ecological wasteland. With this in mind, Vinson made it clear that eradicating the invasive rabbits and goats was paramount to ensuring the long-term survival of the Round Island flora and fauna. To bring this to fruition, \\"...he toured international conservation bodies in 1964, and submitted a special report to the IUCN in 1965\\". This likely led to the first international magazine article on the conservation of Round Island's fauna.NEWMAN, K. B., AND A. B. BANNISTER. 1965. Did the Dodo Die in Vain? Animals, 7: 199-203. Local action to exterminate the goats and rabbits also sprung up from Vinson's campaigning, but this was too sporadic to have any real impact, and even these local efforts ceased after Vinson's unexpected death in May, 1966. Over the next decade, sporadic hunting and various political impediments resulted in little change to the survival of introduced goat and rabbit populations, leading to the island's endemic tree populations dwindling. In 1976, however, Gerald Durrell and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, DWCT) sponsored the conservation of critically endangered birds in Mauritius and the ecological restoration of Round Island. In the same year, a systematic program of eradication began that eventually removed the goat population by 1979 and in 1986, a team led by Don Merton eradicated the rabbit population using the newly-developed poison brodifacoum. By the time both goats and rabbits had been eradicated from Round Island, Gerald Durrell and the DWCT had negotiated a conservation agreement with the new government (in 1984) that initially focused on the endemic vertebrates, but led to a closer relationship that \\"helped create the local capacity and infrastructure for effective species management\\". Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has dramatically recovered. This is especially stark for the three endemics Latania loddigesii, Pandanus vandermeerschii and Hyophorbe lagenicaulis, which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks Leiolopisma telfaririi and Scelotes bojerii, the geckos Phelsuma guentheri, P. ornata and Nactus serpensinsula, and the snake Casarea dussumerii. Much of the continuing conservation work on Round Island revolves around removing the introduced plants and invertebrates.  Endemic species  Rare reptiles that are endemic to Round Island include the Round Island skink, Round Island day gecko, Round Island boa, and the extinct Round Island burrowing boa. Rare plants endemic to the island include the bottle palm.  History  The inconclusive Battle of √éle Ronde was fought off the island by British and French naval squadrons on 22 October 1794.

Milestone of Malaysia Federal Route 1 between Sibu and Bintulu in Sarawak. Pan Borneo Highway (), also known as Trans-Borneo Highway or Trans-Kalimantan Highway (), is a road network on Borneo Island connecting two Malaysian states, Sabah and Sarawak, with Brunei and Kalimantan region in Indonesia. The highway is numbered AH150 in the Asian Highway Network and as Federal Route 1 in Sarawak. In Sabah, the route numbers given are 1, 13 and 22. The highway is a joint project between both governments which started as soon as the formation of Malaysia in 1963 which comprised Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore. The lack of a road network system in Sarawak was the main factor of the construction. The length of the entire highway is expected to be about for the Malaysian section, for the Bruneian section and for the Indonesian section. The Indonesian sections of the Pan Borneo Highway is known as the Trans- Kalimantan Highway. The western route connects the city of Pontianak to Tebedu.  Route background  The Pan-Borneo Highway, Asian Highway Route AH150 is supposed to be a circular highway that runs along the coastlines of Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and Kalimantan. However, a missing link does exist from Serudong, Sabah to Simanggaris, North Kalimantan, which is supposed to connect Sabah with North Kalimantan. The Malaysian section of the Pan-Borneo Highway is signposted as Federal Route 1 in Sarawak and Federal Routes 1, 22 and 13 in Sabah. The 1,077-km highway in Sarawak is divided to 92 sections altogether, and the sections are sometimes being signposted along with the route number with the syntax of xx-yy, where xx is the route number and yy is the section code. In Brunei, the highway is signposted simply as the AH150. In Kalimantan, the Trans-Kalimantan Highway consists of three main highways. The northern route, also dubbed as Trans Border Highway (Jalan Lintas Perbatasan), runs along the Malaysia-Indonesia border from Tamajuk to Sei Ular. The central route runs from Pontianak to Samarinda through the interior of Kalimantan. The southern route, which runs along the coastline of Kalimantan from Sambas to Simanggaris, is gazetted as the Indonesian section of the Asian Highway Route AH150. None of the three highways bear any route number yet. The Malaysian and Indonesian sections are linked together by a highway known as the Trans- Malindo Highway (Jalan Lintas Malindo), which is gazetted as Federal Route 21 in Malaysia.  History  The Pan-Borneo Highway was built due to the lack of the intercity highway network in the island of Borneo. In East Malaysia, the intercity highway plan only existed after the Second World War ended in 1945, after the states of North Borneo (Sabah) and Sarawak were ceded to Britain to become British Crown Colonies. By 1949, the Governor of North Borneo reported that there were of roads paved with asphalt, of other metalled roads, of dirt roads and of bridle paths. The construction of the intercity highway network in Sabah and Sarawak intensified at a faster pace after both states participated in the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. In Sabah, the first federally-funded intercity highway project ever constructed was the Federal Route 22 from Kota Kinabalu to Sandakan, as a joint project between the Malaysian federal government with the government of Australia. Also dubbed as the \\"Malaysia-Australia Road Project\\" (MARP), the construction of the FT22 highway began in 1968 and was completed in 1982 with Telupid town became the main centre of the project headquarters. In the meantime, the Kota Kinabalu‚ÄìPapar section of the Federal Route 1 was completed in 1964, followed by the Kota Kinabalu‚ÄìKudat section which was completed in the 1970s. The entire Sabah Federal Route 1 was completed in 1981 after the construction of the final section from Papar to Sindumin was completed that year. Two years later in 1983, the construction of the Tawau‚ÄìSemporna Highway (part of the FT13 highway and the entire section of the SA51 highway) was completed. The construction of the remaining section of the FT13 highway was completed in the early 1990s after the construction of Sungai Kinabatangan and Sungai Segama bridges were completed. Meanwhile, in Sarawak, the construction of the first intercity trunk highway in Sarawak was commenced in 1965, dubbed as the \\"First Trunk Road\\". Most of the highway network in Sarawak was constructed within the decades of the 1960s to 1980s. The Lawas‚ÄìMerapok‚ÄìSindumin section was completed in 1981 while the final missing link from Sibu to Bintulu was completed in 1985. However, the highway had not been fully paved with asphalt yet at that time; it was only by the end of Sixth Malaysia Plan (RMK6) in 1995 that the FT1 highway in Sarawak was fully paved. Before 1996, all routes in the Pan-Borneo Highway network in Malaysia were state highways. After the Federal Roads Act 1959 was made effective in Sabah and Sarawak in 1984, those highways were re-gazetted as federal highways in 1996 with the route number of FT1 (from Sematan to Kudat through Brunei), FT13 (Mile 32 Sandakan to Tawau) and FT22 (Tamparuli to Sandakan).Federal Roads Act 1959 (Act 376). Accessed on 8 November 2015. Those highways were later gazetted as a part of Asian Highway Network Route AH150. Meanwhile, the road transportation network in Kalimantan region did not exist until the 1970s when logging roads were built by logging companies. Later, about 75% of the logging roads were converted to national roads. The Trans-Kalimantan Highway (southern route) was completed in 2016 with the opening of the Tayan Bridge. Although some sections had been upgraded to divided highways, the Pan-Borneo Highway was notorious for its poor condition in many sections. , of the Indonesian Trans-Kalimantan Highway was built below the Asian Highway Network Class III standards (lane width: 3.0 m; design speed limit: 80 km/h). Meanwhile, the overall condition in many sections of the Malaysian section of the Highway was poor with many potholes, because most sections of the highway were built with standards as low as JKR R3 (design speed limit: 70 km/h; minimum lane width: 3.0 m). A study to upgrade the entire highway to a super two highway under JKR R5 standard (design speed limit: 100 km/h; minimum lane width: 3.5 m) was done, which was expected to cost RM16 billion. Ultimately, the Malaysian federal government had opted to upgrade the Pan-Borneo Highway to a divided highway. The upgrade works of the Pan-Borneo Highway to a divided highway is expected to be completed by 2023 for the Sarawakian section and by 2025 for the Sabahan section, with the overall cost of RM27 billion.

Warisan Tarang owns BHP. It starts at Sindumin and ends at Serudong. In 2019, UEM announces that UEM- MMC-Warisan Tarang JV Sdn Bhd agrees the Pakatan Harapan government's decision to terminate their role as PDP. Since then, the joint venture company would gave up their operation dan gives the project to other contractors to continue.  Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak  In 2015, then Prime Minister Najib Razak and then Chief Minister, Adenan Satem launched the Pan Borneo Highway project in Telok Melano. The main purpose was to upgrade the two-way lane to four lane two-way lane. 50 years ago, long-distance travelling was the only way through the two way and it was unhappy news for those who traveled to other parts of the state for working abroad and holiday seasons. It was Adenan's manifesto to upgrade the state's infrastructure. 10 contractors were involved in this project, beginning with Samlig Resources Sdn Bhd for works package (WPC01) which connects Telok Melano and Sematan in December 2015 as the first contractor and ended with Konsortium KPE Sdn Bhd for Sg. Tangap to Pujut Link Road in July 2016 as among the last contractors to do so. The length of this project was almost 10,000 km and the cost was near RM1 billion.

The two parallel crossings for northbound and southbound lanes are respectively 5,159 feet (1,572 m) and 5,185 feet (1,580 m) in length. It was built in 1979, superseding an older swing bridge by the same name that was composed of low-lying truss segments. The modern bridge has three lanes in each direction, in addition to a shoulder which is often used by buses to get past traffic slowdowns. Old bridge The original Old Cedar Avenue Bridge, also known as the Long Meadow Bridge, was built in 1890. The bridge that stands now was built in 1920 and carried automobile traffic into the 1990s. Back when the old structure was the main crossing, heavy traffic delays would occur because of the bridge's small size and the need to operate the swing segment to let boat traffic pass. The narrow span continued operation as a bicycle trail until 2002 when it was deemed too unsafe. In 2008, $2 million in state funding was approved to reopen the bridge to bicyclists and pedestrians. In 2013, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and the restored bridge opened to the public on October 14, 2016.

Art Folz and the 1925 Chicago Cardinals Prior to the 1933 season, the National Football League team with the best record in the standings at the end of the season, was named the season's NFL Champions. In 1925, with the Chicago Cardinals trailing the Pottsville Maroons a half game lead in the standings, two extra games were scheduled by the Cardinals against the inferior Milwaukee Badgers and Hammond Pros, both of which were NFL members at the time, to close the standings gap. Art Folz, an Englewood High School graduate and a substitute quarterback for the Cardinals, convinced four players from Englewood High School to join the Milwaukee Badgers for the game under assumed names, thereby ensuring that the Cardinals' opponent was not a pro caliber club. The Cardinals later defeated Milwaukee 59‚Äì0. NFL President Joseph Carr later learned that high school players had been used and told reporters the 59-0 Cardinals win would be stricken from the record. However, the league had never got around to removing it. The game is still a part of the NFL records. The Cardinals' owner, Chris O'Brien, was also fined $1,000 by Carr for allowing his team play a game against high schoolers, even though he claimed that he was unaware of the players' status. Badgers' owner Ambrose McGuirk was ordered to sell his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. Art Folz was then barred from football for life. However prior to the 1926 season, Folz's lifetime ban was lifted, however he chose not to return to pro football. The $1,000 fine against O'Brien was rescinded. McGuirk though had already sold his Badgers franchise to Johnny Bryan, a fullback with the Chicago Bears. The Englewood players were also forgiven, and two of them, William Thompson and Charles Richardson, earned high school all-star recognition at the end of the season. Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a \\"practice game\\" and would in no part affect their amateur status.

Oh, tell me is there sunshine In class and hall and heart For I should like to join that school And try to do my part. Violence and school rivalries In 2002, 18-year-old Englewood senior Maurice Davis was shot to death at a bus stop located in front of the school. He was the seventh student killed in or near a public school in Chicago. Before closing, this school was a participant in one of the oldest rivalries in the United States against Hyde Park Career Academy.List of High School Football Rivalries over 100+ Years. Closing and building uses The school board decided in 2005 that, due to its poor performance, Englewood would be phased out over a three-year period to allow the freshmen who had entered to be the final class to graduate. Many reasons were behind the closing of this school. It was one of the worst performing public schools in the US for the end of 2008. There are two new schools currently using the same building: Urban Prep Academy, a public charter high school for young men (opened in 2006); and TEAM Englewood, a public coed charter school that opened in 2007.

It lies two miles from Tynan and close to the border with County Monaghan. It is situated in the Armagh City and District Council area. It had a population of 237 people (91 households) in the 2011 Census. (2001 Census: 240 people) Geography Middletown was built in the townland of Middletown, which was known throughout the 17th century under variants of the name Killecannagan (). It is known for its picturesque countryside and its rolling green hills. The hills are made up of numerous drumlins that make up the countryside. At the bottom of the valleys that many of these drumlins form, glens can be found with many tributaries of the River Blackwater flowing through them. The River Cor flows through the Middletown countryside and right by the village. It is the most prominent river in Middletown; once a canal system operated on it, namely the Ulster Canal. History Middletown was one of several Catholic border villages in Armagh that would have been transferred to the Irish Free State had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925. Education Children from Middletown formerly went to three different primary schools: St John's Boys' School, St Louis Convent School for girls, and Glasdrummond Primary School (boys and girls). Due to low numbers in the mid-1990s, a new school was built on the site of St John's Boys' School and was opened in June 1999, whereupon all three primary schools were amalgamated.

It lived about 267 million years ago. The only species is Eotitanosuchus olsoni. Description Skull cast of Eotitanosuchus Eotitanosuchus is known from a single large skull without a lower jaw. The skull was 35 cm, but the overall length may have been over 2.5 m. Like Biarmosuchus tener, it was primitive in that, though it was a predator, the temple opening behind the eye was small, giving it a weak bite. The temple was, however, larger at the top than in other biarmosuchians. Paleoecology Eotitanosuchus fossils were found in the Perm (or Cis-Urals) region of Russia. Eotitanosuchus was without doubt a dominant animal of its environment. Found preserved in flood deposits (once coastal bogs) containing many skeletons of estemmenosuchids, it has been suggested that this large predator was an excellent swimmer, possibly semi-aquatic or frequenting marshy ground. This, however, is just speculation. Classification Eotitanosuchus is often grouped with the Phthinosuchidae and the Biarmosuchidae. In fact, Ivakhnenko (1999) argues that Biarmosuchus tener and Eotitanosuchus olsoni are the same organism, which would eliminate the Eotitanosuchia as a separate taxon, this conclusion does not seem to have been widely accepted. Regardless of the eventual outcome of this debate, Ivakhnenko's paper does seem to show that Eotitanosuchus is very similar to Biarmosuchus. Further, given the rather close similarity between Eotitanosuchus and later therapsids, this observation supports the view that Biarmosuchia is paraphyletic. Others view Eotitanosuchus as quite distinct from other basal therapsids and perhaps closer to the Gorgonopsia but gorgonopsian specializations are either not present in Eotitanosuchus or, as is more often the case, the state of the characters is unknown. This genus is characterized by many primitive features of the septomaxilla, the postorbital, the parietal, the interparietal, the basioccipital, the quadrate rami of the pterygoid and the vomers of the skull. The length of the dorsal process of the premaxilla (front jawbone) and the postorbital twisting (rear side of the skull) constitute specializations that indicate it is not a direct gorgonopsian ancestor. These features, however, are shared by the anteosaur and biarmosuchid lineages.  See also  *List of therapsids  References  * Chudinov, P.

The tower the transmitter antenna is located on is the tallest structure in the state of Oklahoma, although Oklahoma City itself is in the \\"distant\\" area of the coverage area, according to Radio-Locator.com.. This is due to the 103.5 frequency being four spaces away from the 104.1 frequency in Oklahoma City, making it difficult to properly cover the market. History KRPT-FM went on the air as a Country station in 1981 serving the Anadarko area. The station later changed its calls to KRMP in March 2003 and became known as \\"Superstar Country 103.5.\\" The station moved to southwest of Oklahoma City from Anadarko in July 2004 and became KVSP \\"Power 103.5\\" with a Mainstream Urban format making it Oklahoma City's first Urban station on the FM dial since KAEZ (Now Sports KRXO-FM) departed in 1985. Meanwhile, KVSP was launched as an Urban Contemporary radio station in 1993 on 1140 AM and was called Power Jammin' 1140. It was the first African American-owned and operated station under Perry Broadcasting's ownership as the Oklahoma radio market was not serving the Black community too well at the time based on Perry's perceptions; Perry would later acquire and launch sister station KJMM in Tulsa the year after as part of the \\"Power Jammin' Network\\". For years KVSP played Hip Hop, R&B;, Old School/Classic Soul and Gospel for years, and was the home of the Tom Joyner Morning Show. When KVSP relocated to the FM dial position in 2004, it was renamed Power 103.5. Upon the transition, KVSP modified its format to Mainstream Urban and began carrying the Doug Banks Morning Show. As for the 1140 AM frequency, it is now an Urban adult contemporary formatted station as Heart & Soul, swapped call letters KVSP for KRMP (previously on 103.5), and still airs Tom Joyner in the mornings.

The butterfly style derives its name from the resemblance of the spread goal pads and hands to a butterfly's wings. The butterfly style is contrasted with stand-up style, where most shots on a goal are stopped with the goaltender on their feet. Many factors helped make it a de facto standard style of play today, including the popularization of the goalie mask by Jacques Plante, Vladislav Tretiak's outstanding use of the style at the 1972 Canada‚ÄìUSSR Summit Series, the National Hockey League (NHL) emergence of Tony Esposito in the 1970s and Dominic Hasek in the 1990s, the development of lightweight materials for pads and the influence of professional goaltending coaches such as Warren Strelow, and Benoit and Fran√ßois Allaire. There are few who exclusively employ a stand-up style in the NHL.Although it is effective and popular among goaltenders, the butterfly style can leave the upper portion of the net more vulnerable to scoring attempts. The modern profly derivative was made most popular by Patrick Roy and is the style most commonly used and taught. The profly style is a specialized progression of the butterfly style. The name derives from a goaltending leg pad model designed specifically for the use of the butterfly. The term eventually evolved into a style for goaltenders who tend to use the butterfly save technique as a base for the majority of their save selections. The term \\"hybrid\\" is commonly used to measure how far a goaltender strays from using the butterfly technique as a base save. Some goaltending circles use the term \\"hybrid\\" as a middling term from a pure butterfly goaltender to a pure stand-up goaltender. History Glenn Hall is generally thought to be the first goaltender to react to shots by dropping to his knees. This was remarkable because he did it without a mask. Other contemporaries, such as Terry Sawchuk and Jacques Plante (who, while not having invented the goalie mask, is credited with having popularized it) relied mostly on the stand-up style. Plante actually tried the butterfly style when sharing goaltending duties with Glenn Hall in St. Louis, but cautioned others against its use except under certain types of screened shots.Plante, Jacques (1972). On goaltending: Fundamentals of hockey netminding by the master of the game. Toronto: Collier MacMillan Canada. . Hall's innovation was improved upon later in the 1960s and 70s by Roger Crozier and Tony Esposito. In spite of their success, the butterfly fell out of favour until the emergence of Patrick Roy in the mid-1980s. This new, modern butterfly style has been referred to as the \\"profly\\" style. Prominent advocates of the \\"profly\\" progression of the butterfly include Canadian coaches Fran√ßois Allaire and Benoit Allaire. Many believe that the advent of the Profly style was made possible by improved, heavily armored chest/arm pads and more protective face masks. Prior to these advancements, goaltenders wore chest/arm pads made of felt. To avoid injury, goalies had to trap all pucks with their gloves. Modern, lightweight plastics and energy absorbent foams allowed goaltenders to block and trap shots with their bodies. Equipment designers such as Michel Lefebvre (of Koho and Reebok fame), Michael Vaughn of Vaughn Custom Sports and the late Brian Heaton (of Brian's and Heaton fame) were at the forefront of the equipment advancements. Patrick Roy worked with the Allaire brothers and used Lefebvre-designed pads and Heaton-designed gloves in the late 1980s to modernize the style. As in many arts, there is no universal agreement on style classifications with modern goaltending techniques. Modern hybrid coaches such as the late Warren Strelow worked with goaltenders associated with the profly style such as Miikka Kiprusoff. The butterfly is not a style but a save selection used by most goaltenders. Contrasted with stand-up The butterfly style is contrasted with \\"stand-up\\" style goaltenders. The profly and the hybrid are more specialized progressions of collections of technical moves enveloped within the modern butterfly style. The butterfly term is often used to describe the newer profly style of goaltending refined by luminaries such as Ed Belfour, making it popular in the early 2000s by goaltenders such as Rick DiPietro, Martin Biron, Roberto Luongo, Marc-Andr√© Fleury, Marc Denis, Henrik Lundqvist and Jean-S√©bastien Gigu√®re, the latter being very profly-oriented. Profly, hybrid, and stand-up style comparison The deep 'blocking' butterfly stance used by Marc-Andr√© Fleury Due to the common nature of the butterfly save, certain styles have been named based on the commonality of an individual goaltender's use of the butterfly. Common (but not exclusive) attributes of profly/blocking goaltenders are those have wide butterflies, use stiffer leg pads (often with no knee breaks), and tendencies to cover the lower portion of the net. Goaltenders who use the butterfly as the base of the majority of their saves are commonly referred to as \\"profly\\" or blocking-style goaltenders. Profly goalies tend to modify their save techniques to take up as much net as possible and leave shooters with the smallest space possible to shoot at. Profly goaltenders tend to also be very mobile when in the butterfly stance and excel at using butterfly-based movement techniques such as butterfly crawls and butterfly slides to move. NHL goaltenders such as Marc- Andr√© Fleury, Henrik Lundqvist and Roberto Luongo fit into the profly/blocking style of goaltending. While there are many degrees a goaltender can be labelled as a \\"hybrid\\" from a \\"profly\\" goaltender, it is most commonly accepted that hybrid goaltenders are those who use their reflexes to make saves rather than depending on blocking with their bodies. Common (but not exclusive) attributes of hybrid goaltenders are narrower butterflies, the use of much more flexible leg pads, and the use of a variety of different save types (to include the butterfly). One common difference between a number of hybrid goaltenders and profly goaltenders is the tendency for hybrid goaltenders to return to the standing position after any given save, when able. While a profly goaltender may use a butterfly slide to move into position after a rebounded shot, a hybrid goaltender may opt to return to the standing position and T-push or shuffle into position. NHL goaltenders such as Ryan Miller, Evgeni Nabokov and Tim Thomas all fall into the \\"hybrid\\" model of goaltending. Thomas has coined his goaltending style as the \\"battlefly\\" style, emphasizing his aggressive tendencies and techniques. The semi-upright stance used by Martin Brodeur The original \\"stand-up\\" style is considered obsolete by modern goaltending circles. However, there are still a few remaining goaltenders who are commonly said to be in the furthest hybrid spectrum opposite of a pure profly goaltender. These few are often considered to occupy the \\"modern stand-up\\" style of goaltending. A modern stand-up goaltender almost never completely commits to a full butterfly and stays on their feet as much as possible. Modern stand-up goaltenders commonly have excellent mobility on their skates and show above-average proficiency in puck-handling and making saves with their stick. Martin Brodeur was arguably the last stand-up goaltender remaining in the NHL. Technical moves Wade Flaherty in 2008, using the V-H move (\\"split butterfly\\") to react to a scoring opportunity close to the net There are a number of other recent technical innovations in response to the puck and shooter position on the ice. A hallmark of profly is the puck-side leg staying down when recovering to the skates fully upright, to reposition for a rebound or second shot. Rather than picking up the leg closest to the puck, the leg furthest away from the puck is raised, then pushing the puck-side leg toward the puck. At this point, the goaltender may roll back onto the puck-side skate blade, facing the shooter in the familiar ready stance. Profly goaltenders tend to have an easier time \\"skating\\" on their knees, also known as the \\"backside push\\", or the \\"butterfly slide\\". This term describes where one leg is down, and one is up. The goaltender pushes with his/her leg up laterally from the heel, laterally toward the down leg. This allows for a slide from the up leg to the down leg without getting off the ice completely. If a goaltender is on the inside corners or if the pad faces as in non-progressed \\"butterfly\\" styles, the push results in a tendency to roll over onto one's chest and belly. The V-H move (also called the Split Butterfly or loading the post) is a move with which profly style goaltenders identify. This is a relatively recent tactical response to a shooter that is advancing from behind the net towards the front of the net, and has the option to pass. The goaltender places the knee farthest from the shooter down horizontally along the goal line. The knee closest to the puck remains vertical next to the goal post. The advantage is on coverage against quick shots to the near side of the net, while still covering the option to track passes to the front of the goal mouth.

Wise, The Bridwell family in America (1978), 105. to 1978. It was an institution of the Pillar of Fire Church. History In June 1917 an elderly German professor came to Zarephath, the headquarters of the Pillar of Fire, and offered to teach college level classes. Several other classes were organized around a standard college curriculum. The college was first allowed by the New Jersey Department of Education to grant Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 1921 and the name Alma White College was chosen. Alma White's son, Arthur Kent White was the first president starting in 1921. Alma White was the founder of the church. In 1923 the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey provided funding for the school, allowing it to become \\"the second institution in the north avowedly run by the Ku Klux Klan to further its aims and principles.\\" Alma White said that the Klan philosophy \\"will sweep through the intellectual student classes as through the masses of the people.\\" At that time, the Pillar of Fire was publishing the pro-KKK monthly periodical The Good Citizen. In 1927 the college conferred its first Doctor of Divinity degree. Arthur Kent White retired as president in 1971. The college made the decision to shut down its liberal arts and science programs. The state gave the school permission to allow the students already enrolled to complete their studies until graduation. It graduated its last student in June 1978. The buildings suffered heavy damage in 1971, 1999, and 2011 from flooding on the Delaware and Raritan Canal and the Millstone River. After the closing of the college, the Pillar of Fire continued to operate Zarephath Bible Institute [ZBI], which historically had operated on the campus. In early 2001, on the same campus, the Pillar of Fire founded Somerset Christian College. Following the flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011, the Zarephath campus buildings have been condemned, and all classes meet at Stonecrest Church in Warren, New Jersey.

She sat on the Education, Natural Resources, Executive Board, Reference, Legislative Performance Audit committees and is the vice chairperson of the Intergovernmental Cooperation committee. Drug policy=Salvia divinorum Senator Vickie McDonald supported a proposal for the addition of the psychoactive herb Salvia divinorum to Nebraska's Schedule I classification early in 2008. Salvia divinorum is currently legal in that state, but Senator McDonald has said - \\"Nebraska needs to classify salvia divinorum and its active ingredient, salvinorin A, as a controlled substance in order to protect our children from a drug being portrayed as harmless when it's not.\\"Bruning 2008-01-07 (US Media). [...] \\"Videos of teens using this common plant to get high have become an internet sensation\\" [...] \\"Anytime anything's on YouTube it's an issue,\\" [...] \\"Legislators, parents, grandparents, we need to be on top of these things,\\" [...] \\"We need to protect our children and this is one way we can do it.\\"Berry 2008-01-07 (US Media).White 2008-01-08 (US Media). Her bill proposes addition of Salvia divinorum to Schedule I of the Nebraska Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Possessing Salvia would be considered a Class IV felony with a penalty of up to five years. Trafficking would fall under a Class III felony with up to a 20-year penalty. Opponents of extremely prohibitive Salvia restrictions argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine.[i]Nutt et al. 2007. While not objecting to some form of regulatory legal control, in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high-strength extracts, most Salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation.[ii]Siebert (Legal status). Tobacco and alcohol Senator Vickie McDonald's second highest political campaign contributions from industry groups in 2006 came from \\"Beer, Wine & Liquor\\" related industries. Her third highest campaign contributors in 2006 came from industries related to \\"Tobacco companies & tobacco product sales\\".MiSP 2006.

In light of this it is argued that Salvia divinorum could be better understood more positively as an entheogen rather than pejoratively as a hallucinogen.Blosser (Mazatec Lessons).

It was designed to resemble a crystal flower. If constructed, it would have become one of the world's tallest buildings. The tower was one of the projects of the Fortune Group, which has a number of other projects in Dubai such as the Fortune Bay and Fortune Tower. The proposed building plan contained 74 floors of office space, a retail area at the base, and a hotel and serviced apartments in the top 27 floors.

The storyline began when Fethry Duck was enlisted in the secret international organization, whose purpose it is to find and counter paranormal threats to humanity before the public finds out about them and panics. Because of Fethry's general eagerness to involve Donald in his every interest, Donald involuntarily learned of the organisation and was enlisted too. Characters * The Head: A large dark-skinned man who leads the organisation with an effective leadership style. * Katrina Kolik: A rough and tough female agent who functions as Donald's and Fethry's frequent supervisor. She believes in serious-minded, traditional secret agent behavior, and Donald's and Fethry's unorthodox methods often get on her nerves. * Snort: A small, blue space alien with a long snout. He is the organisation's alien expert and also participates in training new agents. He speaks only in a strange grunting language which some other characters understand, but Donald and Fethry do not. * Jackson and Finch: Two moderately experienced agents who enlisted Donald and Fethry and later became somewhat jealous of them. * Boysenberry: A female mechanic, at least once enlisted as a saboteur. Enemies Donald and Fethry have faced on their TNT missions include a strange blue jelly-like organism that grew everywhere (Blue Rain), a shapeshifting alien pirate (Gilor Borax), a horde of ghost rats killed by the Pied Piper, and a kingdom of demon-like monsters, led by monster king Molok Mak, who were about to break loose from their underground habitat. The TNT pays their agents well for each mission but demands that the organisation be kept in total secrecy. When Donald groused that he was not paid by a German town for eliminating their ghosts, the Head reminds Donald that he was under cover and that any payment would have gone to TNT. TNT also does nonconfrontational work, such as cleaning up a gigantic mess of skunk oil that Donald created in Duckburg, while he was on a mission. Publication history The TNT series was created by Lars Jensen (writer), Flemming Andersen (artist), and David Gerstein (editor/co-writer) for Egmont Creative A/S (Denmark), and Egmont's European affiliate publishers have generally published the full TNT series in local editions. Non-Egmont European publishers have thus far generally published most, but not all, of the stories. North America's Gemstone Publishing published the first five, with IDW Publishing more recently publishing the second five. In 2014, the last TNT stories written by Lars Jensen were released. The series has been taken over by Byron Erickson, who has written five TNT stories so far.

One of a small handful of Six Day races around the world, the Cliff Young has had many fine performances culminating in November 2005 with Yiannis Kouros, arguably the best multiday runner in the world, setting a new world 6 Day record. It started in 1983 and was renamed in 2004 after Cliff Young, a Colac farmer and winner of the inaugural Sydney to Melbourne Westfield's Ultramarathon in May 1983.  History  After Cliff Young (a potato farmer) won the ultramarathon in 1983, the City of Colac was inspired to stage a 1000-mile race in Cliff's honour - the 1983 Cliff Young Colac 1000 which started in Melbourne and ended in the Colac Memorial Square. In the following year, the City of Colac announced its decision to stage a six-day race. A 400-meter track was created in the Memorial square and named in his honour. Initially named the 1984 Colac Ultra Marathon, it later became known as the Australian Six Day Race - Colac. Fourteen runners entered the inaugural race including the great Yiannis Kouros and British multiday runner Eleanor Adams-Robinson. Kouros easily won, covering over 1022 km, setting a new world record and Adams-Robinson also broke 11 world records. The race was renamed in early 2004 in honour of Cliff Young, who died in 2.11.2003. In 2005, at the age of 49, Yiannis Kouros returned to the recently renamed race and again demonstrated his unparalleled capacity by setting a new 6 Day world record by covering just over 1,036 km, breaking the course record and set new world record times for covering 500 km and 1000 km in his age group.  Recent years  The event has not been held since 2006 and it is not expected to return.

Hassey is notable for being the only catcher in MLB history to have caught more than one perfect game (the first with Len Barker in 1981 and his second with Dennis Mart√≠nez in 1991). Hassey joined Gus Triandos as the only catchers in MLB history to have caught a no- hitter in both leagues.\\"Gus Triandos Looks Back on his Catching Career\\", Baseball Digest, June 1997, Vol. 56, No. 6, ISSN 0005-609X Early life Hassey is the son of Joseph Bill Hassey, a former baseball player in the New York Yankees‚Äô minor-league system. He was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, and attended Tucson High Magnet School where, in 1972, his team went undefeated and won the state championship. He then went to the University of Arizona coached by Jerry Kindall. In Hassey's senior year (1976) the Wildcats won their first of three NCAA Championship's under Kindall. Hassey's father also played for Tucson High Magnet School and the University of Arizona. Playing career (1976‚Äì91)=Minor leagues Hassey was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 18th round of the 1976 amateur draft. He played for the San Jose Bees, the Williamsport Tomahawks, the Toledo Mud Hens, and the Portland Beavers. MLB regular season He made his MLB debut on April 23, 1978, and played his final game on September 3, 1991. He played in 1,192 regular season games, finishing with a .266 batting average, 71 home runs, and 438 runs batted in. He had the highest average among all catchers in the 1980 baseball season with a .318 batting average. On May 15, 1981, Hassey caught starting pitcher Len Barker's perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays. On June 13, 1984, Hassey was involved in a high-profile trade, when the Cleveland Indians traded him along with Rick Sutcliffe and George Frazier to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Joe Carter, Mel Hall and Don Schulze. While with the Oakland Athletics he was known for almost exclusively catching all of starting pitcher Bob Welch's games, most notably during the 1990 season in which Welch won 27 games and earned the Cy Young Award trophy. On July 28, 1991, he caught Dennis Mart√≠nez's perfect game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He had been catching Mart√≠nez exclusively that season with the Expos. MLB postseason Hassey played for the Athletics in three World Series. He was a member of the A's team that lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 World Series, and he was catching Dennis Eckersley during the legendary Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run. He was also a member of the A's team that defeated the San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series (though he did not play in the series), and lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 World Series. In five postseason series, Hassey tallied an impressive career postseason .323 batting average. Post-playing career (1992‚Äìpresent) Hassey was a coach for the expansion Colorado Rockies from 1993 to 1995, and for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1996.

Kinney is best known for his \\"Venice of America\\" development in Los Angeles. Kinney around 1900 Early life Kinney's family moved to Washington, D.C., and became known in politics. His aunt's husband was Senator James Dixon of Connecticut. At the age of 16, the Kinney went to Europe, where he studied in Heidelberg, Paris and Z√ºrich and became fluent in six languages. A walking tour of Italy took him to Venice and the Italian Riviera. Returning to Washington in 1869 he joined the Maryland National Guard and in 1873 was able to join a U.S. Geological Survey team to map the Sioux reservations of the Dakotas. He traveled to Salt Lake City and Oregon and rejoined the survey team in the Yosemite Valley. In 1874, Kinney joined the tobacco business run by his older brother, Francis S. Kinney, with offices in New York. The Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company did much of its purchasing in the Southern states and then took an interest in imported tobaccos. In 1876, Abbot traveled to Egypt and Ottoman Macedonia. Kinneloa Kinneloa c.1905 Instead of returning home, Kinney took an extended vacation through Europe, India, Ceylon, New Guinea, Australia and Hawaii. After his arrival in San Francisco in January 1880, his plans to travel east by train were delayed by snow. So Kinney, an asthmatic, improvised with a side trip to a Southern California health resort, the Sierra Madre Villa Hotel. After showing up without a reservation, he slept on a billiard table in the parlor, where he awoke in the morning free of asthma symptoms. This positive experience inspired him to purchase of nearby property, which he named \\"Kinneloa\\".The History of the Kinneloa RanchIn Kinney's Own Words Conservationist Kinney was appointed to a three-year position as chairman of the California Board of Forestry. There he developed an agency to protect the forests of the San Gabriel Mountains, where ranchers typically set fires to clear land for livestock grazing, but then, as a result, subsequent rainfalls led to flooding in the valleys. On his own property, he developed land management techniques for raising livestock alongside cultivated forests. Aided by his friend naturalist John Muir, Kinney established the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve in December 1892, forerunner to the Angeles National Forest. In 1883, Kinney and Helen Hunt Jackson co-wrote a report for the U.S. Department of the Interior on the condition of California Mission Indians. This report and others led to the Mission Indian Act of 1891, which created a commission to seek to establish or confirm reservations in Southern California.Dale, E. E. (1949) The Indians of the Southwest (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press)Sutton, I. (1964) \\"Land Tenure and Occupance Change on Indian Reservations in Southern California,\\" Ph. D. Diss. in Geography (Los Angeles: UCLA). In 1887, Kinney established the nation's first forestry station in Rustic Canyon on of land donated by Santa Monica co-founder John P. Jones (also a U.S. Senator from Nevada), and Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker. One of the station's projects was a study of the newly introduced eucalyptus trees. Real estate developments=Santa Monica Kinneloa did not suit Kinney's first wife Margaret Kinney in the summer months, and in 1886 they built a summer home in Santa Monica. Kinney formed the Santa Monica Improvement Company in 1887 and built a lawn tennis club. In 1887 Kinney purchased of land on the bluffs north of Santa Monica Canyon to be developed as \\"Santa Monica Heights\\", but economic conditions forced Kinney to abandon the project. Collis P. Huntington of the Southern Pacific Railroad bought the property in 1891 and renamed it \\"Huntington Palisades.\\" Kinney shifted his attention to the coastal area south of Santa Monica. Ocean Park In 1891, Kinney and his partner, Francis Ryan, bought a controlling interest in Pacific Ocean Casino and a tract of land 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and wide along the Santa Monica beach. Kinney and Ryan built a pier, golf course, horse-racing track, boardwalk and other resort amenities. Kinney convinced the Santa Fe Railroad to extend its Inglewood line north to his resort. Ryan died in 1898, and his widow's new husband, Thomas Dudley, sold their half interest to a group of men (Fraser, Gage and Merritt Jones) not to Kinney's liking. With a flip of a coin, which Kinney won, he took the marshy southern half to build his Venice of America. Abbot Kinney Boulevard is named for him. Venice of America The Venice recreation area opened on July 4, 1905. Venice came to be known as the \\"Coney Island of the Pacific.\\" By mid-January 1906, an area was built along the edge of the Grand Lagoon patterned after the amusement thoroughfares of the great 19th and 20th century expositions. It featured foreign exhibits, amusements, and freak shows. Trolley service was available from Downtown Los Angeles and nearby Santa Monica. Visitors were dazzled by the system of canals complete with gondolas and gondoliers brought in from Venice, Italy. There were ornate Venetian-style businesses and a full-sized amusement pier. Around the entire park, a miniature steam railroad ran on a track. Kinney and some of the nearby residents were aghast at some of the low- class shows that Venice began to offer, but it was considered the best collection of amusement devices on the Pacific Coast, and made a handsome profit. Eventually, Kinney gained control of city politics and had the name changed from \\"Ocean Park\\" to \\"Venice\\" in 1911. Kinney was also allowed to build a breakwater to protect his facilities from storm tides. Kinney Heights Around 1900 Kinney developed a suburban tract at what was then the western edge of the city of Los Angeles. Named Kinney Heights, the development attracted mostly upper-middle-class families who built large Craftsman homes, many of which still stand. The area is now part of the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ).

Family life In his travels to the California State Legislature in Sacramento, Kinney met Margaret Thornton, daughter of Associate California Supreme Court Justice James D. Thornton. They were married in November 1884 and had seven children, three of whom died during childhood. After Margaret died in June 1911, Kinney married Winifred Harwell in 1914, formally adopting her two children by him. Kinney died suddenly in November 1920. He is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica. Legacy The Venice Pier business was carried on by Kinney's oldest son Thornton. In December 1920, however, the amusement pier was completely destroyed by fire, except for the new roller coaster and the bandstand tower. The operation was rebuilt and reopened in six months. The miniature railroad ran until 1924. Venice became part of the city of Los Angeles in October 1925. The Venice of America canals came under sharp scrutiny by the health department. The lack of water circulation through the system left the waters turbid and malodorous. The bulk of the canals were paved over in 1929 after a protracted three-year court battle. The remaining canal district stayed in poor condition until extensively renovated in 1992. The canals have since become an expensive residential section and many large, modern houses have been built. The Venice Canal Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. The Venice Pier's demise came in 1946 when the city did not renew the lease on the tidelands. Abbot's adopted son, Thornton Parillo, left a government position and moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he wrote stories and books on his father's experience in Southern California. Kinney's creative spirit continued on to his children and the next generation. Though most of Abbot Kinney's work has been demolished, some of his buildings and Venetian-style arches remain, along with his breakwater. In fiction In the urban fantasy / alternate history novel, California Bones (Tor Books, June 2014), by Greg van Eekhout, Abbot Kinney's Venetian experiment grew to encompass all of Los Angeles, taking the place of what might otherwise have become L.A.'s metropolitan roads, becoming part of a hydraulic empire overseen by an immortal William Mulholland.

Wilkes was born in Melbourne and educated at Northcote Primary and Secondary Schools and Preston Technical College. During the Second World War he served in the southwest Pacific in the Australian Army as a radio operator. After the war he studied accountancy, and worked in his father's furniture factory, of which he later became manager. In 1954 he was elected to Northcote City Council, which he almost completely dominated.Lyle Allan (1984), 'Ethnic transition in inner- Melbourne politics', in James Jupp (ed.), Ethnic Politics in Australia, George Allen and Unwin, North Sydney, New South Wales, page 143. R.H. Badham (1977), 'Introducing Frank Wilkes', Nation Review, 9‚Äì15 June. Wilkes served as a Councillor until 1978, but he never became Mayor, as work commitments being both a councillor and a parliamentarian were too great.Andrew Lemon (1983), The Northcote Side of the River, Hargreen Publishing Company, North Melbourne, Page 269. The state electorate of Northcote had been held since 1917 by John Cain, leader of the Labor Party and three times Premier of Victoria. Wilkes became a prot√©g√© of Cain's and joined the Labor Party in 1948, despite his family background in business. He was Cain's campaign manager at the 1952 and 1955 state elections. Upon Cain's sudden death in 1957, Wilkes was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the subsequent by-election. He became Labor Whip in 1959, and Deputy Leader in 1967. Wilkes was a loyal deputy to Clyde Holding, who led the ALP in opposition from 1967 to 1977 and lost three elections to the Liberal Party, first to Henry Bolte and then to Sir Rupert Hamer. When Holding resigned after the ALP's landslide defeat in 1976, Wilkes claimed the leadership by right of long and loyal service, rather than any outstanding ability. He was an uninspiring speaker and no match for the urbane Hamer in Parliament or on the hustings. Nevertheless, at the 1979 state election, Labor under Wilkes gained eleven seats, the party's best showing for 24 years.Michael O'Grady (1979), 'The party leaders: Hamer and Wilkes,' in Peter Hay, Ian Ward, John Warhurst (eds.), Anatomy of an Election, Hill of Content, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 91-104. The ALP even won constituencies in eastern Melbourne, a region from which it had been shut out for a quarter- century. However, due to the uneven nature of the swing, Labor came up nine seats short of making Wilkes premier. While Wilkes had brought Labor within striking distance of victory at the next election, few within the party thought that he could take the party further. John Cain Junior, son of the former Premier and a man whom most believed to be of greater ability than Wilkes, had been elected to Parliament in 1976 and by 1979 was among the leading ALP parliamentarians. During 1980 and 1981 Cain's supporters (such as Bill Landeryou) destabilized Wilkes's leadership and eventually forced his resignation. When Cain led Labor to victory in 1982, Wilkes was made Minister for Local Government. He retired in 1988 from Parliament after more than 30 years of service. In the 1989 Queen's Birthday honours, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia for service to government and politics and to the Victorian parliament.Wilkes, Frank Noel, It's an Honour, 12 June 1989. Wilkes' daughter Helen Buckingham was a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006. Wilkes died on 20 August 2015, aged 93.

It was pioneered by Stanley William Hayter. The process uses the principle of viscosity to print multiple colors of ink from a single plate, rather than relying upon multiple plates for color separation. It is a fine art printmaking technique, making original prints in limited editions, as it is slow and allows too much variation between proofs to make large editions feasible. Color viscosity printing is among the latest developments in intaglio printmaking. Color viscosity printing was developed by a group working at Atelier 17 in Paris in the mid-1950s. This group included Stanley William Hayter, Kaiko Moti, Krishna Reddy, and Shirley Wales. Intaglio There are a number of different types of original print methods to be aware of. Intaglio prints: for example a dollar bill‚Äîbills and most stamps are engraved in metal plates and are printed after a viscous ink (about the consistency of oil paint) is forced into grooves, scratches, etched lines or indentations. The polished surface is then wiped clean using newsprint and tarlatan, leaving ink only below plate level. The plate is then covered with a dampened paper and felt blankets. It is run through the press where great pressure (approximately 8 tons to the square inch) pushes the dampened paper down into the engraved or etched grooves to pick up ink. In other words, in intaglio we see printed what is below the surface of the plate and the ink is now embossed on the paper. Among the greatest masters of engraving and etching are Albrecht D√ºrer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Rembrandt, Goya, and Picasso. The process Three to four colors of ink are mixed, each of a different viscosity. This viscosity is adjusted by the addition of uncooked linseed oil. Metal plates, usually copper or zinc, are used, as in the intaglio processes. The artist produces images on the plate by etching lines or textures. The plate is then inked in several stages. The first ink would be fairly dense‚Äîof a relatively high viscosity. The application of the high-viscosity ink is carried out as in any intaglio process: by forcing it into the recesses of the plate and then wiping off the plate's surface with a tarlatan. Ink of a second color, and the thinnest viscosity, is then applied to the surface of the plate with a hard rubber roller, so that it covers the plate in one pass and only transfers onto the highest areas of the plate. Ink of a third color, and a much stiffer consistency, is then applied to the lower areas of the plate with a softer rubber roller. The varying viscosities of the two rolled-on inks prevent them from mixing. A fourth color, of even thinner viscosity, can also be applied at this point. This color is either spread out on a glass plate, which is then pressed against the printing plate so that the ink only adheres to the highest points of the metal plate, or it is applied by a hard roller applied with very little pressure. This process may be done with a monotype as well. Inking the acrylic or plexiglass plate with one ink with a very high viscosity, and following that, rolling a very loose ink over it, produces two tones on a single plate. One may attempt to scratch an image onto the plate, but acrylic and plexiglass plates are more temperamental than copper or zinc, and wear out sooner. A sheet of printing paper is then placed on the upright plate and passed through a printing press, which prints all of the colors simultaneously. This is of a certain advantage, as in some other multi-color printing processes, correct registration of the blocks presents a difficulty.

These include, for example, the restoration and use of a number of the so-called \\"Vesuvian villas\\" in and near Ercolano (ancient Herculaneum), a string of once luxurious villas built in the 18th century and severely damaged by aerial bombardment in World War II. The most prominent of these is the Villa Campolieto, already restored, open and the site of chamber concerts by the Alessandro Scarlatti association. The most important musical activity on the islands in the Bay of Naples is on the island of Ischia on the premises of the Mortella Gardens and Villa, the site of the William Walton Foundation, which hosts a yearly music and opera workshop. The Flavian amphitheater in Pozzuoli, one of the greatest such structures in the ancient world, has undergone extensive restoration and is the site of outdoor summer concerts.

Further afield, in other provinces of the region, the city of Avellino has two prominent musical facilities: the Domenico Cimarosa Conservatory and, after a century without a decent opera house, the new Carlo Gesualdo Theater, opened in 2002 with a presentation of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro The city of Benevento has put to musical use some of its considerable array of ancient Roman archaeology, most prominently the Roman Theater from the 2nd century. Various musical activities are hosted there as part of the city's ongoing self-promotion as the City of \\"Spettacoli\\". The city also has a music conservatory located in the large Palazzo De Simone. The annual Festival of Ravello is a popular music venue in Italy. Here, an orchestra starts to set up on a stage overlooking the Amalfi coast. The city of Caserta is best known as the site of the \\"Versailles of Italy\\", the gigantic Bourbon Royal Place built by Luigi Vanvitelli in the mid-18th century. The court theater on the premises is the site of frequent concerts, as are the new Communal Theater and the nearby San Leucio complex, an old silk-producing facility and site of a yearly music festival, the eclectic motto of which is \\"From Giovanni Paisiello to Frank Zappa\\". Caserta is the only provincial capital in the Campania region without a music conservatory. The province of Salerno includes Ravello on the Amalfi coast with the famous Ravello Festival, certainly one of the important musical and artistic affairs in Italy. The city of Salerno has its own permanent opera company (the only one in the region except for Naples). The city is also the site of the fine Giuseppe Martucci conservatory as well as the newly reopened Verdi Theater.

The tale is about housekeeping and insect pests in the home, and reflects Potter's own sense of tidiness and her abhorrence of insect infestations. The character of Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse debuted in 1909 in a small but crucial role in The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies, and Potter decided to give her a tale of her own the following year. Her meticulous illustrations of the insects may have been drawn for their own sake, or to provoke horror and disgust in her juvenile readers. 25,000 copies of the tale were initially released in July 1910 and another 15,000 between November 1910 and November 1911 in Potter's typical small book format. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a woodmouse who lives in a \\"funny house\\" of long passages and storerooms beneath a hedge. Her efforts to keep her dwelling tidy are thwarted by insect and arachnid intruders who create all sorts of messes about the place: a lost beetle leaves dirty footprints in a passage and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet leaves bits of cobweb here and there. Her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson lets himself into her parlour, stays for dinner, and searches her storerooms for honey but leaves a mess behind. Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse wonders if her home will ever be tidy again, but after a good night's sleep, she gives her house a fortnight's spring cleaning, polishes her little tin spoons, and holds a party for her friends. Potter's life had become complicated with the demands of ageing parents and the business of operating a farm before the composition of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and, as a consequence, her literary and artistic productivity began a decline following the tale's publication. She continued to publish sporadically but much of her work was drawn from decades-old concepts and illustrations. Mrs. Tittlemouse marks the end of her two books a year output for Warnes. Scholars find the book's depictions of the insects its great attraction. One critic finds a \\"nightmarish quality\\" in the tale reflected in Mrs. Tittlemouse's almost endless war waged against insect pests. Characters from the tale have been modelled as porcelain figurines by Beswick Pottery beginning in 1948, and the mouse's image appeared on a Huntley & Palmer biscuit tin in 1955. Other merchandise has been marketed depicting Mrs. Tittlemouse and her friends. Mrs. Tittlemouse was a character in a 1971 ballet film and her tale was adapted to an animated television series in 1992.  Plot  Mrs. Tittlemouse wiping Mr. Jackson's wet footmarks off her parlour floor. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a tale in which no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have occurred since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.Taylor 1987, p. 143 Mrs. Tittlemouse is a \\"most terribly tidy little mouse always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors\\" in the \\"yards and yards\\" of passages and storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars in her \\"funny house\\" amongst the roots of a hedge. She has a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, a larder, and a bedroom where she keeps her dust-pan and brush next to her little box bed. She tries to keep her house tidy, but insect intruders leave dirty footprints on the floors and all sorts of messes about the place. A beetle is shooed away, a ladybird is exorcised with \\"Fly away home! Your house is on fire!\\", and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet is turned away with little ceremony. In a distant passage, Mrs. Tittlemouse meets Babbitty Bumble, a bumblebee who has taken up residence with three or four other bees in one of the empty storerooms. Mrs. Tittlemouse tries to pull out their nest but they buzz fiercely at her, and she retreats to deal with the matter after dinner. In her parlour, she finds her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson sitting before the fire in her rocking chair. Mr. Jackson lives in \\"a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch\\". His coat tails drip with water and he leaves wet footmarks on Mrs. Tittlemouse's parlour floor. She follows him about with a mop and dish-cloth. Mrs. Tittlemouse allows Mr. Jackson to stay for dinner, but the food is not to his liking, and he rummages about the cupboard searching for the honey he can smell. He discovers a butterfly in the sugar bowl, but when he finds the bees, he makes a big mess pulling out their nest. Mrs. Tittlemouse fears she \\"shall go distracted\\" as a result of the turmoil and takes refuge in the nut-cellar. When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her front door to keep Mr. Jackson out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again. The fastidious little mouse spends a fortnight spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with beeswax and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds a party for five other little wood-mice wearing their Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through the window to him and he toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health.  Background  Helen Beatrix Potter was born on 28 July 1866 in London to barrister Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter. She was educated by governesses and tutors, and passed a quiet and solitary childhood reading, painting, drawing, tending a nursery menagerie of small animals, and visiting museums and art exhibitions. Her interests in the natural world and country life were nurtured with holiday trips to Scotland, the English Lake District, and Camfield Place, the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents.MacDonald 1986, pp. 1‚Äì4 Potter's adolescence was a quiet as her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home.MacDonald 1986, pp. 6‚Äì7 She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi.Taylor 1996, pp. 60,67MacDonald 1986, p. 13 She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.Taylor 1996, pp. 51‚Äì2 In 1900, Potter revised a tale about a rabbit named Peter she had written for a child in 1893, and prepared a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke.Lear 2007, pp. 144‚Äì7 Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours.Hobbs 1989, p. 15 On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.Taylor 1996, p. 76 Potter continued to publish children's books with Warnes and used her sales profits and a small legacy from an aunt to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres (13.85 ha) in the Lake District in July 1905. On 25 August, Potter's fianc√© and editor Norman Warne died suddenly; she became very depressed and was ill for many weeks, but rallied to complete the last few tales she had planned or discussed with him.Lane 1978, p. 140  Development and publication  In the years following Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages.MacDonald 1986, p. 75 She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents with the business of operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911: > I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it > very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I do not seem to be able to > go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of > sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent most of my time upon > the road going backwards & forwards to the farm ‚Äì which was amusing, but not > satisfactory for work.Lear 2007, p. 237 Mrs. Tittlemouse actually made her debut in 1909 in Potter's The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies where she rescued the six children of Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny from Mr. McGregor's grasp and was rewarded for her heroism with a quantity of rabbit wool at Christmas. In the last illustration, she is wearing a cloak and hood, and a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a key (not a central) character in the tale, but a character incompletely personified, and one whose story Potter chose to develop in 1910.MacDonald 1986, p. 118 Potter was an unsentimental naturalist who thought no creature either good or bad, and had no qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or woodlice in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, but, ever sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the woodlice. The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into \\"creepy-crawly people\\" hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack.Taylor 1987, pp. 143‚Äì4 \\"I can alter the text, when I get the proofs,\\" she wrote, \\"and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!\\"Linder 1971, pp. 205‚Äì6 Potter argued for the generic term \\"slaters\\" for the woodlice, but was overruled.Lear 2007, p. 234 It was decided that an illustration of a centipede (Miss Maggie Manylegs) would be withdrawn and replaced with a butterfly. Potter usually tested a new work on an audience by writing the tale into an exercise book, pasting a few watercolour or pen and ink illustrations into the volume, and presenting the whole as a gift to a child.Lane 1978, p. 181 In the case of Mrs. Tittlemouse, Potter wrote the tale in a small leather-covered notebook with twenty-one pages of text and eight watercolours as a New Year's gift for Warne's youngest daughter, Nellie. Its inscription read, \\"For Nellie with love and best wishes for A Happy New Year. Jan. 1. 1910\\".Linder 1971, p. 206 The family called it \\"Nellie's little book\\" and, when the book was published with twenty-six colour pictures, the dedication remained the same.Lane 1978, pp. 175‚Äì6 25,000 copies of The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse were released in July 1910 and available in a small book format in either blue-grey or buff paper boards at 1/- or decorated cloth at 1/6. 10,000 copies were released in November 1910 and another 5,000 copies in November 1911.Linder 1971, p. 429 Potter was pleased with the bound copies she received. \\"The buff is the prettiest colour, though it may not keep so clean\\", she wrote to Warnes, \\"I think it should prove popular with little girls.\\"Linder 1971, p. 207 Her father wrote to the Warne children that his daughter's sense of humour was ever-fresh and never dull.Lear 2007, p. 235 Potter intended to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig in a large format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, she passed an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at her boots.Taylor 1996, p. 118 She abandoned the pig book after fruitless attempts to make progress on it, and, instead, occupied the winter of 1910‚Äì11 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book, and the composition of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes.Taylor 1987, p. 144 Almost sixty years after the publication of Mrs. Tittlemouse, the character appeared in the 1971 Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter, and, in 1992, her tale and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies were integrated into a single animated episode for the BBC series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.  Illustrations  Illustration of Mrs. Tittlemouse with bees. Mrs. Tittlemouse called upon Potter's keen observation of insects, arachnids, and amphibians, and her youthful experience drawing them. Their depictions in text and illustration reflect her understanding of insect anatomy, colouration, and behaviour; they are rendered with accuracy, humour, and true to their individual natures ‚Äì she knew that toads only seek water during the spawning season, for example, and that they can smell honey. The spider and the butterfly are very much like those she drew from microscopic studies in the 1890s.Lear 2007, pp. 234‚Äì5 Potter's source for the wildlife and the insect drawings in Mrs. Tittlemouse were those she had executed in her early adulthood, either directly from nature or by observing specimens in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum.MacDonald 1986, p. 119 The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or Mr. Jackson. Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn for their own sake, or seem to be out of scale with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse in one picture and then smaller in another. The bees are sometimes out of scale with both the toad and the mouse. The nature artist and the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be humanised while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. It is possible Potter's carelessness in the details of Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.Kutzer 2003, pp. 123‚Äì4  Scholarly commentaries  Ruth K. MacDonald of the New Mexico State University writes in Beatrix Potter (1986) that the tale is about housekeeping and dealing with insect pests in the home, and points out that it reflects Potter's pride and pleasure in keeping her house at Hill Top tidy. Tales about humanised mice came easily to Potter, but, unlike the urban mice in The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Two Bad Mice, Mrs. Tittlemouse is a country mouse living beneath a hedge somewhere near Potter's Sawrey. With its narrow passages, small rooms, low ceilings, and well-stocked storerooms, Mrs. Tittlemouse's dwelling is similar to Potter's own at Hill Top. The author's obvious approval of Mrs. Tittlemouse's fastidious housekeeping has its source in her own pleasure in keeping her farmhouse neat, and (like Mrs. Tittlemouse) in being the mistress of her domain. Mrs. Tittlemouse's abhorrence of insect pests reflects Potter's own, but the artist in Potter preserves their beauty in the illustrations ‚Äì she does not censor their antennae or their groping limbs. Potter thought girls would like the tale best, and would experience the same sort of reaction to insect pests she did ‚Äì; to wit, complete horror and disgust.MacDonald 1986, pp. 118‚Äì20 M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh and author of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), points out that the tale is a comic one taking place completely indoors and one with an obvious anxiety about dirt. There is not the sort of revelry one would expect in a tale about a miniature household but rather a \\"desperate sense\\" of wanting to keep that household free of invaders and unwanted outsiders. The Tale of Two Bad Mice is another tale about a miniature household, but there Potter is on the side of the invading two bad mice. Mrs. Tittlemouse is concerned as much about middle class proprieties as the dolls Lucinda and Jane in The Tale of Two Bad Mice but, in Mrs. Tittlemouse, Potter is on the side of the invaded rather than the invaders, who are purely animals with no human characteristics. Kutzer attributes some of the tale's anxiety to Potter's own unhappiness over her fame as a writer and the intrusiveness of visitors at Hill Top who assumed a presumptuous familiarity with the author or regarded her as nothing more than an exhibit for the tourist to take in. Potter was proprietary over Hill Top and jealously guarded it to and for herself and some of this jealousy is projected onto Mrs. Tittlemouse's anxiety about the sanctity of her home. She is not a recluse ‚Äì she invites her friends to a party ‚Äì but like Potter she needs to be in complete control.Kutzer 2003, pp. 122‚Äì3 Kutzer thinks the tale has a \\"nightmarish quality\\". Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse cannot keep one step ahead of the various intruders. Although the house is her own, she has no control over who inhabits it: she finds bees nesting in an empty storeroom and woodlice hiding in the plate rack. She is trapped in her own home, her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will \\"go distracted\\". Although Mr. Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind a mess of honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.Kutzer 2003, p. 123  Merchandise  Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the process in making them so was marketing strategy.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales with spinoffs such as a Peter Rabbit doll, an unpublished Peter Rabbit board game, and a Peter Rabbit nursery wallpaper between 1903 and 1905.Lear 2007, pp. 172‚Äì5 Similar \\"side-shows\\" (as she termed the ancillary merchandise) were produced over the following two decades. In 1947, Frederick Warne & Co. gave the John Beswick Factory of Longton, Staffordshire rights and licences to produce the Potter characters in porcelain. Mrs. Tittlemouse was among the first ten Beswick figurines produced in 1948, and was followed by Mr. Jackson in 1974, Mother Lady Bird in 1989, Babbitty Bumble in 1989, and another Mrs. Tittlemouse in 2000. A Mrs. Tittlemouse embossed plate was produced between 1982 and 1984.DuBay 2006, pp. 30,36 Mrs. Tittlemouse appeared on the lid of a Huntley & Palmer biscuit tin in 1955,DuBay 2006, p. 138 and in 1973, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the first and only American company to be granted licensing rights to manufacture stuffed Beatrix Potter characters in plush. Mrs. Tittlemouse was released in 1975.DuBay 2006, pp. 79,92 In 1975, Crummles of Poole, Dorset began manufacturing Beatrix Potter enamelled boxes, and eventually released a diameter enamelled box depicting Babbitty Bumble and Mrs. Tittlemouse holding her book. In 1977, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts was granted licensing rights to Beatrix Potter, and produced a Mrs. Tittlemouse music box playing \\"It's a Small World\\" the same year. A Mr. Jackson flat ceramic Christmas ornament followed in 1984, and a hanging ornament depicting Mrs. Tittlemouse in her little box bed in 1987.DuBay 2006, pp. 106,120,124  Reprints and translations  As of 2010, all 23 of Potter's small format books remain in print, and are available as complete sets in presentation boxes. A 400-page omnibus edition is also available. First editions, early reprints, and limited edition facsimiles of the Mrs. Tittlemouse manuscript are available through antiquarian booksellers. The English language editions of Potter's books still bore the Frederick Warne imprint in 2010, despite the company being sold to Penguin Books in 1983. In 1985 Penguin remade the book's printing plates from new photographs of the original drawings, and in 1987 released the entire collection as The Original and Authorized Edition.Taylor 1996, p. 216 Potter's books have been translated into almost 30 languages, including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was translated into Afrikaans in 1930 as Die Verhaal van Mevrou Piekfyn and into Dutch in 1970 as Het Verhaal die Minetje Miezemuis. Under licence to Fukuinkan-Shoten of Tokyo, in the 1970s The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse and 11 other stories were released in Japanese.Linder 1971, pp. 433‚Äì7 In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.MacDonald 1986, p. 130 Sources    References ;Footnotes External links Peter Rabbit official website Category:1910 children's books Mrs. Tittlemouse, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse Category:Picture books by Beatrix Potter Category:Frederick Warne & Co books ","title":"The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse"},{"id":"4474017","text":"The Decatur, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area is a moderately urban region of North-Central Alabama.

KSSE is licensed to Arcadia, California and broadcasts to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. KSSD is licensed to Fallbrook, California and serves northern San Diego County. KSSC is licensed to Ventura, California and its signal covers Ventura County. The first two stations simulcast with KLYY in Riverside, airing a Spanish Adult Hits format known as \\"Jos√© 97.5 y 107.1\\". KSSC formerly aired a separate Spanish Adult Contemporary format branded as \\"\\"La Suavecita 107.1\\"\\". From 1991 to 2019, the three stations formed a same-channel trimulcast covering Southern California from Ventura to San Diego. As of December 31, 2019, KSSC in Ventura switched to Jos√©, reforming the trimulcast on 107.1. KSSE, KSSD, and KSSC are all licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast in the HD Radio format. History=Early years of the trimulcast The oldest of the stations is the one licensed to Arcadia, California, which signed on in 1960 with original callsign KMAX. It was owned by Max H. Isoard and his Sierra Madre Broadcasting Company; it aired a format targeted at various ethnic groups. In 1988, John Douglas bought KMAX with the intent to integrate it with other stations that would serve the entire Greater Los Angeles area with a rimshot signal. He accomplished this by purchasing two stations in San Diego and Ventura counties that had been operating separately, middle-of-the-road outlet KAVO in Fallbrook and adult contemporary-formatted KAGR in Ventura, for $2.1 million. Together, these three class A FM stations broadcast a city-grade signal across Los Angeles County and surrounding counties, at a lower cost than purchasing a single class B station. Initially, the trimulcast retained its format of brokered-time programming, much of which was targeted to the African-American church community. One popular show during this time was Spiritual Vibes, a gospel music show hosted by Ollie Collins, Jr. Also in the lineup was an all-night program playing classic, traditional, and contemporary \\"black gospel\\" music, hosted by veteran gospel music DJ \\"Sister Ruth\\" Dixon, known for her signature Caribbean accent. In 1994, the trimulcast switched to a sports format under the \\"Sportsmax 107.1 FM\\" name and call letters KMAX, KBAX, and KAXX. Sportsmax hosts included Joe McDonnell, the SportsGods (Dave Smith and Joey Haim), and Rich Herrera. The stations broadcast games featuring the San Francisco 49ers, Oakland Raiders, Notre Dame Fighting Irish football, and the Los Angeles Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League. Additionally, the triplecast aired urban talk/R&B; program The Tom Joyner Morning Show weekdays for a brief time. In November 1995, Douglas sold the three stations, along with co-owned KWIZ-FM in Santa Ana, to Odyssey Communications for $35 million. The following year, on March 27, 1996 at 4 p.m., Odyssey flipped the trimulcast to a modern rock format branded \\"Y107\\", with the stations' respective call signs changed to KLYY, KSYY, and KVYY. Y107 competed directly with Los Angeles' established alternative rock station, KROQ-FM. Spanish formats On December 13, 1999, the trimulcast stations flipped to Spanish adult contemporary Mexican Cumbia as \\"Viva 107\\", First Cumbia Was La Pollera Colora from the 70's retaining the same call signs. On December 24, 2002, following owner Big City Radio's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, Entravision Communications purchased KLYY, KSYY, and KVYY for $137 million in cash and stock. Viva remained on air for a short time following the sale. Last cumbia was Mentiras by Grupo Aroma. In 2003, the 107.1 FM trimulcast adopted a rock en espa√±ol Spanish Adult Contemporary format branded \\"S√∫per Estrella\\". First Rock en Espanol hit was Cordillera by Los Enanitos Verdes. The first Spanish Adult Contemporary Hit was Amiga Mia by Alejandro Sanz The format originally launched in 1997 on KVAR (97.5 FM) in Riverside, then expanded to KACD-FM (103.1 FM) in 2000. Accompanying the flip was a set of new call signs to match: KSSE, KSSD, and KSSC ‚Äî the first of these moving from the Riverside station. On July 13, 2007, KSSE started adding three to four English-language songs per hour. The first song in English was \\"Move Ya Body\\" by Nina Sky at 9:04 p.m. At 9:11 P.M the second was Since U Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson At 9:17 p.m. third song was Survivor By Destiny's Child. At 9:22 p.m. fourth song was The Sweet Escape By Gwen Stefani. On April 22,2012 at 12:05 a.m. The last English-language song was Hot Girls by Dony and Elena Gheorghe and bilingual version La La La (Hot Girls) by Da Zoo Super Estrella dropped, Discontinued and Disappeared the English-language songs. ( On January 5, 2015, the KSSE/KSSD/KSSC trio was among the first Entravision-owned stations to launch El Show de Piol√≠n, a nationally syndicated program hosted veteran radio personality Eddie \\"Piol√≠n\\" Sotelo. On December 1, 2016, after Entravision's other S√∫per Estrella stations had slowly disappeared across the United States, all air staff was let go and KSSE's trimulcast began stunting. The last song played on S√∫per Estrella was \\"Persiana Americana\\" by Soda Stereo. On December 5 at 12:02 a.m., the station flipped to Spanish Variety Oldies under the name \\"La Suavecita\\". S√∫per Estrella became an online-only service with four distinct streams. Jos√© and end of the trimulcast On January 7, 2019, Entravision broke the 107.1 FM trimulcast. KSSE and KSSD dropped La Suavecita and began simulcasting KLYY and its Spanish adult hits format; this new trimulcast is branded as \\"Jos√© 97.5 y 107.1\\". KSSC in Ventura County retained the \\"La Suavecita 107.1\\" branding until December 31. KSSC is currently branded as \\"Jos√©\\".

It is scarce in western Europe, in Britain being confined to a small number of sites in northern England and Wales. Ribes alpinum grows to 2 m (6.5 feet) tall and 1.5 m (4.9 feet) broad, with an upright and dense shape. The bark is initially smooth and light grey, later it becomes brownish grey and eventually starts to flake off. The buds are scattered, compressed and light green to white. The leaves are palmate. The upper side of the leaves are dark green with scattered hair, while the bottom is light green. The male and female flowers are on distinct specimens. Both kinds of flowers are organized in clusters in the corners of the leaves, where the male's are the longest. The individual flowers are small and greenish-yellow.

History KGOU was originally licensed as a commercial rock music station to the University of Oklahoma in 1970, broadcasting at 106.3 FM. OU applied for a non-commercial Class A license and switched the station's format to NPR news and talk on New Year's Day, 1983. The studios were originally located in Kaufman Hall on the OU campus. The station's repeater network began more or less out of necessity. KGOU's main signal operates at 6,000 watts, which is fairly modest for a full NPR member on the FM band. This was necessary to protect what is now KTUZ-FM at nearby 106.7. As a result, KGOU's signal is spotty at best in most of Oklahoma City. To solve this problem, soon after joining NPR, OU sought a license for a repeater station that would better cover the northern suburbs. This station, KROU, officially signed on June 28, 1993. It was the first in a network of repeater stations that cover much of central and western Oklahoma. KGOU's format is primarily news/talk on weekdays, with jazz, blues, and world music programs on weekends, broadcasting programs from NPR, PRI and other public radio networks alongside locally produced news and music programming. KGOU renovated space in Copeland Hall on the OU campus in 2006 and moved its broadcasting studios that fall.

He led the Lions to the College World Series in 1986. Layana was drafted by the New York Yankees in the third round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. He pitched four seasons in the Yankees system before being selected by the Cincinnati Reds in 1989 in the Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut with the Reds on April 9, 1990, in an 8‚Äì4 Reds win over the Houston Astros at the Astrodome, pitching one hitless shutout inning in relief of starter Tom Browning. He was a key cog in the Reds' 1990 bullpen which included Layana and \\"Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)\\"http://cincinnati.com/blogs/reds/2013/06/13/a-nasty-reunion- nasty-boys-come-back-to-area/ Rob Dibble, Randy Myers and Norm Charlton as well as relievers Tim Birtsas, Scott Scudder and Rick Mahler.

Known as The Queen of Oyster Bay and The First Lady of Oyster Bay by its Long Island residents, Ethel was instrumental in preserving both the legacy of her father as well as the family home, \\"Sagamore Hill\\" for future generations, especially after the death of her mother, Edith, in 1948. Early years Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt and daughter Ethel, 1902, by Cecilia Beaux Ethel Carow Roosevelt was born in Oyster Bay, New York to Theodore Roosevelt and Edith Kermit Carow. From an early age, young Ethel Carow showed practical leadership qualities. Her father once remarked: \\"she had a way of doing everything and managing everybody.\\" She quickly made her place in the family, causing upsets in her numerous fights with the sensitive Kermit. Her sensitivity also showed. When she was four, her father was reprimanding Kermit by shaking his shoulder; Ethel, with tears in her eyes said, \\"Shake me, Father.\\" She was thought to have resembled somewhat her older first-cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt. They each had soft, blue eyes, golden-blond hair but Ethel lacked Eleanor's height and had a heavier build in her waistline than did Eleanor. Many in the Roosevelt family thought her capable and charming, determined personality to be like that of her Aunt Bamie Cowles. At Sagamore Hill, Ethel aggressively took part in all the games, and especially enjoyed horseback riding with her mother. Like her mother, she enjoyed needlework, and easily managed the younger children. White House years Ethel at the White House in the fall of 1901 Quentin on the left, TR, Ted, Jr., \\"Archie\\", Alice, Kermit, Edith, and Ethel In the White House, Ethel often filled in for her mother by placing meal orders and delegating tasks to the staff. She was only 10 years old when her father became President after William McKinley's assassination in 1901. During her family's years in the White House, Ethel always tried to keep as low a profile possible because she did not seem to enjoy the attention as much as her half-sister Alice Roosevelt did. She was also encouraged to maintain her low-key persona by her mother Edith, who believed that a woman only made the news to announce her birth, marriage and death. Ethel attended school at the National Cathedral and had difficulty making friends due to her father's position. Just months before the Roosevelts' departure from the White House, Ethel had her Debut and Coming Out Party in the White House on December 28, 1908. Ethel was just 17 at the time of her debut, one year shy of the typical age of 18 that most women \\"came out.\\" The reason for this being the fact that the family was due to leave the White House less than three months following Ethel's debut. This would be last opportunity to do so if Ethel was to \\"come out\\" from Pennsylvania Avenue. Service During World War I, Ethel, now a nurse, served in France in the same hospital where her husband served as a surgeon. Later, she became involved with the Red Cross, and served as Nassau County Chairman during World War II, and then as Chairman of the Nassau County Nursing Service. Her long involvement, even while traveling, is shown by her correspondence still residing in the Nassau County Red Cross archives. When the Red Cross brought her Fifty Year Service Pin to Sagamore Hill, they had to correct themselves‚Äîit was not fifty years of service, it was sixty. When it came time to have her portrait painted, she did not choose to wear an evening gown and jewels, she wore her Red Cross uniform. She put in many years of work to turn Sagamore Hill into a National Historic Site. Ethel was one of the first two women to serve on the Board of Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History. Marriage and family On April 4, 1913, she married Richard Derby, a surgeon. Mrs. Derby helped his efforts in France during World War I where she served as a nurse in the American Ambulance Hospital. Ethel was the first of T.R.'s children to serve in the war. Ethel's marriage produced four children: *Richard Derby Jr. (1914‚Äì1922) who died at age eight of sepsis *Edith Roosevelt Derby (1917‚Äì2008) who married Andrew Murray \\"Mike\\" Williams and resided until her death in Washington state on Vashon Island and in Seattle. *Sarah Alden Derby (1920‚Äì1999), who married Vermont State Senator Robert T. Gannett. *Judith Quentin Derby (1923‚Äì1973) who married Adelbert \\"Del\\" Ames III. All of the children were raised in Oyster Bay, where Ethel was regarded as a church and community leader earning her the nickname \\"Queen of Oyster Bay\\". Later life and death In her later years, Derby devoted more time to the American Civil Rights Movement, a cause she had long been devoted to. She worked on a smaller scale, though no less committed than her first-cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt and believed in solving local problems before working nationally. When she felt black residents were being discriminated against, Derby formed a committee to bring low-income housing into Oyster Bay. The proposal initially was rebuffed by most of the residents. Ethel had her friends meet at her house where she convinced them that this was a good idea and the housing project was successfully completed. A large number of black people continue to reside in these areas Mrs. Derby helped to build.

In 1977 she made her final visit to the White House to see Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn.

British Leyland Harold Musgrove had worked in various roles at British Leyland and its predecessor Austin before being offered the role of Chairman of the volume car business Austin Rover in 1982 after the departure of Sir Michael Edwardes, reporting to Roy Horrocks, the chairman of British Leyland's new formed car group. One of his first jobs was to negotiate the contract with Honda over the XX agreement which would eventually become the Rover 800 and had to deal with the Trojan Horse political potato that had occurred with BL's previous collaboration, the Triumph Acclaim. Another of his major decisions was to clear the decks of the design team at Austin Rover. David Bache had been running the team, and the LC10/LM11 project which eventually produced the Austin Maestro/Austin Montego had been in the pipeline since 1977, and one of his ideas is said to have incited Musgrove into sacking Bache on the spot. He appointed Roy Axe who had been working the US for Chrysler and backed him setting up a new design studio at the former Triumph plant at Canley. Due to the drop in performance of Austin Rover in 1984, Harold Musgrove was asked by the British Government, which had held a controlling stake in the business since 1975, to look for savings. Musgrove peruaded the government to invest in the K Series engine which was to benefit and damage the company in the long term. In 1986 British Leyland's head of Cars Ray Horrocks had discussions with Ford about a buyout, however the collapse of General Motors purchase of British Leyland's truck division meant the deal was stopped. Due to the press anger caused by this and the Westland sale, British Leyland's management was changed by the government bringing in Graham Day in 1986 to oversee the new business. Roy Horrocks, Musgrove's boss resigned and Musgrove followed shortly after when he was asked to sack Kevin Morley, the sales director, by Graham Day. NHS In 1991 Musgrove joined the NHS as chairman of the West Midlands Ambulance Service. He eventually left this role joining Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham and oversaw the controversial merger with Solihull District Hospital during the mid 1990s. In 1998 Harold Musgrove became Chairman of the Worcester Health Services, closing accident and emergency services at Kidderminster Hospital and opening a new PFI funded hospital as part of a radical shakeup of services. However a University College London report in 2000 stated that the reforms left Worcestershire with \\"one of the lowest levels of hospital provision in the country\\".

It was produced by Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment and Telepictures Productions and was distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. The show ran for 12 seasons, from September 16, 1991 until May 21, 2003; and was taped in Chicago, Illinois at WMAQ-TV studios. Format When the series began, a traditional talk show format reminiscent of Oprah was used. However, ratings were low during the first two seasons, and by 1993 it began to move away from serious subjects and began to take on more unusual subjects and theme shows such as paternity tests, out-of-control teens (including shows in which they are sent to boot camp), confronting former bullies (something Jones dealt with when she was young), makeovers for people who had individuality, celebrity impersonators, talent contests (and at times, people who made it an obsession to enter them, especially parents of the children who enter the pageants/contests/shows), feuding neighbors, strippers and secret crushes. The show would also feature regular live performances by bands of varying genres (notably pop, punk, rock, hip-hop, and R&B;), ranging from lesser known bands from the local Chicago area to more well known bands from around the USA and Canada. Many well-known artists first appeared on Jenny Jones including Usher, Ludacris, Tamar Braxton, Nelly, and Three Six Mafia, who made their first national TV appearance on the show. The final live performance of alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. before their initial 1997 disbandment was a performance of \\"Out There\\" on the show earlier that year. Comparisons and outrageous titles During its run, critics would equate this show to The Jerry Springer Show, which was also produced at WMAQ-TV studios, although Jones claimed that her talk show was not as outrageous as Springer's. Critics also believe that some of Jones' ideas were copied from Ricki Lake after her show, Ricki Lake, debuted in 1993 and overtook her in the ratings. It was also rumored that, when Rosie O'Donnell started The Rosie O'Donnell Show, she and Jones had hostility toward each other despite the fact that both their shows were syndicated by Telepictures and both were friends with Lake (both even sent shout-outs to her show, albeit separately). Many of the themes also appear on Maury, such as DNA testing and boot camp, but the guests on Jenny Jones were less contentious than those on Maury. Show titles were often sensational, and usually in rhyme. For example, the title \\"You May Shake It for Money, But Leave Those Sexy Clothes at the Club, Honey!\\" was used to describe a sexy makeover show for women whose occupations involve working in nightclubs or strip clubs. The rhyming titles feature began with the show's third season. Murder of Scott Amedure On March 6, 1995, Jenny Jones taped an episode called \\"Same Sex Secret Crushes\\" on which Scott Amedure, a gay man, confessed to an associate, Jonathan Schmitz, that he had a crush on him. Schmitz appeared unconcerned as he laughed about that revelation in front of the audience. However, three days after the taping, an upset Schmitz killed Amedure. After the murder made headlines, the producers decided not to air the show, though it aired during Court TV's (now TruTv) coverage of the trial as part of the presentation of evidence to the jury. Clips of the episode were also featured in the HBO documentary Talked to Death, and the first episode of the Netflix docuseries Trial By Media. Schmitz's history of mental illness and alcohol/drug abuse came to light during the trial in which Schmitz was later convicted of second degree murder. Jones and the producers were later sued by Amedure's family for neglecting to find out Schmitz's history of mental illness and substance abuse. Jones testified under oath that the producers told Schmitz that his admirer could be a man, but Schmitz thought that the admirer was a woman. Amedure's family won the ruling and the show was ordered to pay $25 million, but that decision was later overturned by the Michigan appellate court which ruled that the producers were not responsible for what happened to the guests after their appearance on the show. Schmitz was released on parole on August 21, 2017. Backlash This incident (and other subjects) led to Dino Corbin, then-general manager of Chico, California, CBS affiliate KHSL-TV, to remove The Jenny Jones Show from its line-up. Corbin claimed that what he perceived to be constant objectionable material (one show involving a transgender dating search that KHSL refused to air) was his reason for the cancellation, not the murder.60th Anniversary Show - KHSL CBS 12 Action News Now's YouTube channel, August 30, 2013 Final years By what turned out to be the final two seasons, the show began to drop heavily in the ratings. Jenny's final farewell on this broadcast in 2003. It was nearly cancelled at the conclusion of season 11, but was saved by a last-minute deal with the Tribune Broadcasting station group, although the subsequent station shuffle necessitated in such key markets as New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles didn't help the ratings erosion. In the 2002-2003 TV season, Jones' program became the lowest-rated daytime talk show , and after the last original episode aired that spring, Jenny Jones was canceled in the summer of 2003. Reruns continued to air until September 12 of that year. Cast of characters The show also had an in-house cast of regulars, some of whom were originally guests before they became fan favorites: * Rude Jude, a DJ who became a fan favorite for his appearance on his past being a bully. He made frequent appearances as an advisor. * Raymond Moses, a drill sergeant for troubled young children recognized for his intimidating presence and booming voice.

In the insurance context an actuarial reserve is the present value of the future cash flows of an insurance policy and the total liability of the insurer is the sum of the actuarial reserves for every individual policy. Regulated insurers are required to keep offsetting assets to pay off this future liability. The loss random variable The loss random variable is the starting point in the determination of any type of actuarial reserve calculation. Define K(x) to be the future state lifetime random variable of a person aged x. Then, for a death benefit of one dollar and premium P, the loss random variable, L, can be written in actuarial notation as a function of K(x) : L = v^{K(x)+1} - P\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1}} From this we can see that the present value of the loss to the insurance company now if the person dies in t years, is equal to the present value of the death benefit minus the present value of the premiums. The loss random variable described above only defines the loss at issue. For K(x) > t, the loss random variable at time t can be defined as: : {}_t L = v^{K(x)+1-t} - P\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1-t}} Net level premium reserves Net level premium reserves, also called benefit reserves, only involve two cash flows and are used for some US GAAP reporting purposes. The valuation premium in an NLP reserve is a premium such that the value of the reserve at time zero is equal to zero. The net level premium reserve is found by taking the expected value of the loss random variable defined above. They can be formulated prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of prospective reserves at a point in time is derived by subtracting the actuarial present value of future valuation premiums from the actuarial present value of the future insurance benefits. Retrospective reserving subtracts accumulated value of benefits from accumulated value of valuation premiums as of a point in time. The two methods yield identical results (assuming bases are the same for both prospective and retrospective calculations). As an example, consider a whole life insurance policy of one dollar issued on (x) with yearly premiums paid at the start of the year and death benefit paid at the end of the year. In actuarial notation, a benefit reserve is denoted as V. Our objective is to find the value of the net level premium reserve at time t. First we define the loss random variable at time zero for this policy. Hence :L = v^{K(x)+1} - P\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1}} Then, taking expected values we have: :\\\\operatorname{E}[L] = \\\\operatorname{E}[v^{K(x)+1} - P\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1}}] :\\\\operatorname{E}[L] = \\\\operatorname{E}[v^{K(x)+1}] - P\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1}}] :{}_0!V_x=A_x - P\\\\cdot\\\\ddot{a}_x Setting the reserve equal to zero and solving for P yields: :P=\\\\frac{A_x}{\\\\ddot{a}_x} For a whole life policy as defined above the premium is denoted as P_x in actuarial notation. The NLP reserve at time t is the expected value of the loss random variable at time t given K(x) > t : {}_t L = v^{K(x)+1-t} - P_x \\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1-t}} : \\\\operatorname{E}[{}_t L\\\\mid K(x)>t] = \\\\operatorname{E}[v^{K(x)+1-t}\\\\mid K(x)>t] - P_x \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\ddot{a}_{\\\\overline{K(x)+1-t}}\\\\mid K(x)>t] :{}_t!V_x=A_{x+t}-P_x\\\\cdot\\\\ddot{a}_{x+t} where P_x=\\\\frac{A_x}{\\\\ddot{a}_{x}} Modified reserves Modified reserves are based on premiums which are not level by duration. Almost all modified reserves are intended to accumulate lower reserves in early policy years than they would under the net level premium method. This is to allow the issuer greater margins to pay for expenses which are usually very high in these years. To do this, modified reserves assume a lower premium in the first year or two than the net level premium, and later premiums are higher. The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, used for statutory reserves in the United States, allows for use of modified reserves. Full preliminary term method A full preliminary term reserve is calculated by treating the first year of insurance as a one-year term insurance. Reserves for the remainder of the insurance are calculated as if they are for the same insurance minus the first year. This method usually decreases reserves in the first year sufficiently to allow payment of first year expenses for low-premium plans, but not high-premium plans such as limited-pay whole life. Computation of actuarial reserves The calculation process often involves a number of assumptions, particularly in relation to future claims experience, and investment earnings potential. Generally, the computation involves calculating the expected claims for each future time period. These expected future cash outflows are then discounted to reflect interest to the date of the expected cash flow. For example, if we expect to pay $300,000 in Year 1, $200,000 in year 2 and $150,000 in Year 3, and we are able to invest reserves to earn 8%p.a., the respective contributions to Actuarial Reserves are: *Year 1: $300,000 √ó (1.08)‚àí1 = $277,777.78 *Year 2: $200,000 √ó (1.08)‚àí2 = $171,467.76 *Year 3: $150,000 √ó (1.08)‚àí3 = $119,074.84. If we sum the discounted expected claims over all years in which a claim could be experienced, we have completed the computation of Actuarial Reserves. In the above example, if there were no expected future claims after year 3, our computation would give Actuarial Reserves of $568,320.38.

The book tells of two shopkeepers who extend unlimited credit to their customers and, as a result, are forced to go out of business. It was originally published in a large format which permitted Potter the opportunity to lavish great detail on the illustrations and also allowed her to include black-and-white vignettes. Potter filled the tale with characters from her previous books. The book was eventually republished in the standard small format of the Peter Rabbit series and was adapted to drama in 1931. Background Helen Beatrix Potter was born to wealth and privilege on 28 July 1866 in London to barrister Rupert Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter. Raised by a series of governesses, Beatrix filled her hours with reading, painting, drawing, and tending a schoolroom menagerie of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Summer holidays in Scotland or the Lake District and long visits to her grandparents' Camfield Place home in Hertfordshire cultivated her love for and observation of the natural world. As a young woman, she was discouraged from seeking higher education, and groomed instead to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in her parents' London home.MacDonald 1986, p. 1 While summering with family in Perthshire in 1893, the 27-year-old Potter sent a story and picture letter about a disobedient young rabbit to the son of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, and continued to send similar letters to the boy and his siblings over the following years. Mrs. Moore recognized the literary value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish them. Potter developed the 1893 letter into The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and worked up a dummy book based on the small book format and style of Helen Bannerman's bestselling Little Black Sambo (1899) with its pages of simple texts opposite appropriate pictures.Lear 2007, pp. 144-5 The late Victorian and early Edwardian children's book market was flooded by inexpensive small format books with profusions of illustrations made possible by technological advances in colour reproduction. The publishing firm of Frederick Warne & Co. wanted to compete in this lucrative market and chose to publish Peter Rabbit after receiving an enthusiastic endorsement from their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke.Lear 2007, p. 147 The illustrations were reproduced by the then-new Hentschel three-colour process which favoured a painterly rather than a linear style and was kinder to watercolours than chromolithography.Hobbs 1989, p. 15 House at Hill Top Potter's career as a children's author and illustrator was launched in October 1902 when The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published to great success. Five books similar in concept and format followed,The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin in 1903; The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice in 1904; and The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in 1905. and, in July 1905, profits from book sales and a small legacy from an aunt allowed Potter to buy a farm called Hill Top at Sawrey in the Lake District.Lear 2007, p. 207 The farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. In the years immediately following its purchase, she produced tales and illustrations based on the farm, its natural surroundings, and nearby villages.MacDonald 1986, p. 75 Ginger and Pickles was inspired by a shop in Smithy Lane, Sawrey, where villagers came to make purchases, visit, and exchange gossip. The book was dedicated to bedridden shop owner and blacksmith John Taylor whose wife and daughter ran his shop. Taylor had long wanted to appear in a Potter book but was unable to leave his bed to pose for the artist. He told her he thought he could pass for a dormouse; Potter made him John Dormouse in the tale. He did not live long enough to see the book or its dedication.Lear 2007, p. 230Hallinan 2002, p. 80 Ginger was modelled on Tommy Bunkle, a cat belonging to Sawrey schoolmistress Mrs. Bunkle. Potter thought the cat's colour unusual and was reluctant to put him in clothes but bowed to her public's preference in storybook animals. She refused however to put him in trousers. Potter wrote to friend Millie Warne during the composition process that the book was causing some amusement in Sawrey: \\"It has got a good many views which can be recognized in the village which is what they like, they are all quite jealous of each others houses & cats getting into a book\\". Potter wrote Ginger and Pickles in a penny exercise book as a Christmas gift for Louie Warne, the daughter of her publisher Harold Warne, and worked on proofs during her 1909 summer holiday at the country house of Broad Leys near Bowness-on-Windermere. The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Ginger and Pickles were the two books chosen for publication by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1909.Lear 2007, p. 225 The book was finished in August. It was published in October 1909 in a large format that was later reduced to the standard small format of the Peter Rabbit library.Lear 2007, pp. 229-30 In 1931, Potter and E. Harcourt Williams collaborated on a dramatization of Ginger and Pickles.MacDonald 1986, p. 129 Plot Ginger, a yellow tomcat, and Pickles, a terrier, are partners in operating a village shop that offers a variety of goods including red spotty handkerchiefs, \\"sugar, snuff, and goloshes\\". Ginger inspires fear in their mouse customers and Pickles their rabbit customers. Ginger's mouth waters as the mice leave the shop with their parcels. However, the pair have a poor grasp of business, extending unlimited credit to absolutely anyone. Consequently no one ever pays for their purchases and the till remains empty. The shopkeepers are eventually forced to eat their own goods. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, Samuel Whiskers, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny. The inclusion of these characters in the illustrations was a clever marketing device and established an artistic consistency from tale to tale in Potter's Peter Rabbit universe. Pickles cannot afford a dog licence and is frightened of the policeman (a German doll with a stitched-on hat). He is certain he will receive a summons. The two go over their records and think their customers will never pay them. When the policeman delivers the rates and taxes at the New Year, Ginger and Pickles decide to close shop thus creating great inconvenience for the villagers. Ginger grows stout living comfortably in a warren and is shown in one illustration setting traps. Pickles becomes a gamekeeper who is shown pursuing rabbits. In the tale's lengthy coda, Tabitha Twitchit, the proprietor of the only other village shop, exploits the situation and raises the prices of everything in her shop. She refuses to give credit. Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter Miss Dormouse sell peppermints and candles, but the candles \\"behave very strangely in warm weather\\" and Miss Dormouse refuses to accept the return of candle ends from disgruntled customers. Finally, Sally Henny-penny sends out a printed poster announcing her intention to re-open the shop. The villagers are delighted and overwhelm the shop on its first day. Sally gets flustered counting out change and insists on being paid cash but offers an assortment of bargains to the delight of everybody. Potter put a crowd of familiar characters from the Peter Rabbit universe into the tale such as Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, Samuel Whiskers and Peter himself. It would prove a clever marketing device. From the literary angle, the many familiar characters create tension and suspense for the reader as most are the natural prey of the eponymous merchants. The reader wonders if the two shopkeepers will control their predatory instincts long enough to make a sale. Themes Ginger and Pickles is Potter's celebration of village life and emphasizes her preoccupation at the time of composition with keeping accounts, making a profit, and dealing with neighbours as clients. Shopkeeping was thought an appropriate subject for children's books of the period and fold-out pages displayed the many products that would be found in a shop. In Ginger and Pickles, Potter offers the child reader not only the various products but a glimpse of what interests adults in a village shop: the quirks and eccentricities of village residents and the social life that revolves around such a place. The animals in the tale are humanized, wear clothing, and pursue a human activity, shopping. Potter's design was to record human life with a cast of animal characters rather than to place her animals in a fantasy world parallel to the human.MacDonald 1986, pp. 114-8 The story also looks at factors of the market economy. Ginger and Pickles get plenty of customers by granting credit but the failure to impose limits means that they do not receive any money in return. Their immediate rival, Tabitha Twitchit, is more astute: by refusing credit she gets fewer customers, but gets to stay in business while Ginger and Pickles go bust. The subsequent lack of competition means that she can raise her prices. Ginger and Pickles is the last of Potter's important Sawrey tales though not developed as fully as its predecessors in complexity of narrative and irony. Domestic life - the prevalent theme of the Sawrey books - is only touched on in the tale with the accoutrements of domestic life such as soap and candles. The irony of the tale lies in two predatory animals operating a shop for what would be their natural prey yet the two are unable to succeed in the venture because of their propensity for extending unlimited credit. Ginger and Pickles both have the ability to survive by exercising their natural instincts but choose instead to behave like humans by running a shop; in the end, starving themselves and permitting their prey to live comfortably and without cost.Kutzer 2003, p. 111 Illustrations Potter's lifelong artistic influences in creating her children's tales were the Pre-Raphaelites in their attention to natural detail, Randolph Caldecott in children's illustration, and the Elizabethan miniaturists. Potter once wrote that she often failed to capture the charm and spontaneity of an original sketch when she was forced to copy it for publication and suggested that the original be used during the publication process instead. This was the case in Ginger and Pickles when the original illustration of Lucinda and Jane peering through the shop window was removed from Louie Warne's manuscript gift book. Potter also suggested the picture of the empty till be removed from the manuscript but it remained where it was and the artist worked up another illustration of the subject.Taylor 1987, p. 143 NotesReferences Footnotes Works cited   External links * * Category:Peter Rabbit Category:1909 children's books Category:Books about cats Category:Dogs in literature Category:Frederick Warne & Co books Category:Fictional dogs Category:Fictional cats Category:Fictional mice and rats Category:British children's books Category:British picture books ","title":"The Tale of Ginger and Pickles"},{"id":"4474278","text":"Apple II processor cards (or co-processor cards) were special cards that could be used to allow the Apple II to use different processors on the (otherwise) same computer hardware.

Policies developed by the government of Reza Shah, under his family planning programs and moves towards more Western social policy, were quickly deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after he took power in the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Abortion was first legalized in 1977.Eliz Sanasarian, The Women's Rights Movements in Iran, Praeger, New York: 1982, . In April 2005, the Iranian Parliament approved a new bill easing the conditions by also allowing abortion in certain cases when the fetus shows signs of handicap,\\"Iran's Parliament eases abortion law.\\" (April 13, 2005).The Daily Star. Retrieved May 12, 2006. and the Council of Guardians accepted the bill in 15 June 2005. Abortion is currently legal in cases where the mother's life is in danger, and also in cases of fetal abnormalities that makes it not viable after birth (such as anencephaly) or produce difficulties for mother to take care of it after birth, such as major thalassemia or bilateral polycystic kidney disease. There is no need for a consent from the father and request and consent of mother with approval of three specialist physicians and final acceptance by legal medicine center suffices. Legal abortion is allowed only before 19th week of pregnancy.Harrison, Frances. (April 12, 2005). \\"Iran liberalises laws on abortion.\\" BBC News. Retrieved May 12, 2006. Much of the controversy has historically stemmed from Iran's status as a theocracy as it was established after the 1979 revolution; many policies, including those concerning social topics, are based on sharia law as interpreted from the Qur'an through the nation's Shi'a legal philosophy. While abortion is not actually referenced in the Qur'an, infanticide is specifically condemned, and this has been used as an argument to keep abortion illegal in most or all cases in which it might be sought. The sections of the Qur'an that detail the importance of health for women have been used to combat this argument, and have been moderately successful at changing the legislation against abortion enacted after 1979. Nowadays, most Islamic legal schools of thought hold that the ensoulment of a fetus takes place four months after conception, which has extended the discussion of abortion in many nations and communities that base their judicial codes off of Islamic law; in Iran, a consensus has recently developed that abortion is legitimate if it is before this four-month mark. Arguing for the legality or partial legality of abortion has the potential to be successful in Iran only if it is through religious discourse. All religious ruling in Iran has its final approval or veto assigned by the Guardian Council, a reviewing and regulatory body that has the ability to support or strike down all policies of Iran. History=Pre-Revolution There is a long history of abortion in Iran. In medieval Iran, it was not shocking to have plant-based agents of abortion and their relative effectiveness listed in physicians' texts; other means of abortion were also described with warnings and instructions for treatment of the woman after the procedure. The dissemination and translation of different medical texts to and from China, India, Greece, and Persia led to attempts to develop extensive lists of all medical practices, including abortion, and the practice is described in detail in texts from many different regions. One text, written by physician and jurist Hakim Esmail Jorjani (1042-1137 AD), gives instruction for the appropriate use of natural abortifacients, with the caveat that these instructions are meant only for \\"a very young mother who fears she may die...or when there is disease in the uterus\\". For a long time, abortion in Persia (and then Iran) was a legal gray area, which may explain why it was not uncommon to describe the correct procedure. Natural abortifacients continued to be used for centuries in Iran, and national law said little about the practice itself until European colonial and imperial intervention in the area. Because of this, up until the last years of the shah's regime, Iranian policy on abortion was partially based on parts of Islamic law and parts of law from the French colonial empire, which had carried influence in the region for some time. The immediate pre-revolutionary period was full of stops and starts in terms of social policy and family planning in Iran, as the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell in and out of favor with Iranians in quick fluctuation, eventually collapsing in the 1979 revolution. The pointed nationalism of the shah's government in the early 1960s made for a generally pronatal policy, as the White Revolution began to reform social and economic law; families were encouraged to have children, and the country was set to expand until the shah began a national family planning program in 1967, when the country's extreme population growth made officials worry about resources diminishing too quickly. Abortion became legal at that time under a set of circumstances and restrictions; in fact, a law passed in 1977 even allowed abortion on request. A law a year earlier \\"broadened access and granted an official license\\" for abortions to be performed in medical facilities such as clinics and hospitals. Abortions were legal so long as the pregnancy had not exceeded twelve weeks, the ensoulment period - or, if it had, so long as the mother's life was endangered specifically by carrying the child to term. The conversation about abortion had begun even before the shah's family planning program in 1967, however; a new global interest in reproductive health and progress in contraception and sexual health matters led a gynecologist in Iran to receive a fatwa from Ayatollah Mahallati of Shiraz that approved of, and even encouraged, contraception with the aim of reducing unwanted pregnancies among Iranian families. One of the reasons the legality of abortion was debated in such open air at this time was that the number of women who had abortion declined in Iran in the 1960s due to increased use of contraceptives. Post- Revolution The 1991 law of Islamic Penalties stated that though abortion was still legally prohibited, it could be allowed to save the life of the mother. This law stands today as a background for further discourse on legalizing abortion in Iran. The legal medicine organization that had the ability to approve of the abortion of a fetus suffering from a specified list of problems was a bureaucratic system that made actual approval hard to obtain. Nearly half of the applicants in the 1999-2000 year were not accepted. Abortion is still haram, or forbidden, according to both Islamic law and to post-revolutionary Iranian law, and the punishments for providing or receiving an illegal abortion can be strict. Under current law, physicians can be sentenced to months of imprisonment, and women who get abortions before ensoulment are at the least fined blood money. In other cases, for example if the abortion takes place after ensoulment, the punishments are more severe: both woman and physician can be sentenced to up to ten years' imprisonment. This is because of the fact that after much debate over the possible legality of abortion in general, the 16-week limit (when ensoulment is believed to happen) was determined by all involved in that policymaking as the last possible time to have a legal abortion for any reason. Regardless of this baseline, the policies now in place regarding the legality of receiving or providing an abortion are vague in some places. Recent developments As a global trend, in recent years, it has become more common for members of relatively developed nations to bring up the question of selective abortion, as science about genetics and techniques for predicting and improving neonatal health has become both more advanced and more common. Iran has been no different; in fact, it is one of the few governments in the Middle East and North Africa that actively supports programs in sexual and reproductive health for its young people. While abortion remains technically illegal in most cases, and in all cases once the pregnancy passes the ensoulment time of 16 weeks, the government has expanded upon its earlier caveat concerning maternal health. In 2005, the Legal Medicine Organization of Iran created a list of 29 fetal problems and 32 maternal issues in pregnancy that indicated that abortion might possibly be legal‚Äîonly if, however, it was determined that the life of the mother and the fetus were both endangered if the pregnancy went through, and that the mother could be saved by an abortion. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa to this effect, allowing abortion in the first trimester for these special cases. The Therapeutic Abortion Act of 2005, passed by the Iranian parliament, stated that if the reason for an abortion was not one of the 61 listed disorders or abnormalities, the cases could be referred to the physician and then the organization, which would decide on an appropriate course of action. The ambiguity of the guidelines for acceptance and the unpredictability of health during pregnancy, however, has not created much definition in the gray area that is Iranian abortion policy. In fact, the Guardian Council rejected the Therapeutic Abortion Act after its passage in 2005, adding to the confusion. Today, most abortions happen \\"in unsafe and hazardous circumstances\\" because the penalties for receiving or giving an abortion can still be quite strict. Common reasons for getting an abortion range from fertility concerns (i. e., already having many children), possible or existing health complications, and socio-economic impediments to pregnancy, such as not being able to support another child. In a nation whose economy depends almost solely on oil, with 50% of revenue coming from those earnings, the distribution of wealth can be strained, and for many families it is not feasible to have many children despite the government's use of oil money to fund statewide welfare systems. With abortion counting for 5% of maternal deaths by some estimates, it is evident that illegal and unsupervised practice of the procedure does occur, and furthermore that it can be quite dangerous to the mother; and with 34% of surveyed pregnant Iranian women in one study reporting their pregnancies as \\"unintended\\", it has been noted that the danger has not disappeared in the shift from firm illegality and condemnation of abortion in Iran to its place in a current legal limbo. Statistics and trends The abortion rate in Iran is contested, and many surveys on the topic land with estimated numbers as opposed to hard data. This is due not only to the inherent difficulty in reaching all populations of Iran, which is a diverse country with large groups of the poor and rural, but also because of the sensitivity of the issue; especially in highly religious groups, the questioning about abortion trends is difficult, and the on-and-off receipt of honest answers has the potential to skew data in a way that makes real conclusions rather vague. The abortion rate does vary significantly among Iran's provinces, but estimates include .26 lifetime abortions per Iranian woman, an estimated 73,000 a year, 27 abortions per 1000 women and 7.5 abortions per 1000 married women, and 11,543 abortions annually in Tehran, the nation's capitol. These statistics are as scholarly accepted as other quite dissimilar ones, such as one study's claim that more than a thousand unsafe abortions \\"take place every day in Iran\\" and another that reports that 100,000 younger women have illegal or induced abortions annually. The exact numbers on abortion in Iran are thus unknown, but there are some trends in the practice that have been widely reported and verified. All over the world, there is a negative correlation between the use of contraceptives and the abortion rate; as the world adapts to new and accessible technologies developed for family planning and reproductive health, Iran is one of many nations that has found a lower rate of abortion in those areas that have higher rates of contraceptive use, which accounts for governmental acceptance and support of family planning and sexual health programs for the young. Additionally, ardent religious objections against the practice of abortion have become less legitimate in the eyes of many, especially in the middle and higher classes of Iran, as developments such as pre-natal genetic testing make abortion more of a viable option in the case of a difficult pregnancy.

It is one of three species of Prosopium endemic to Bear Lake, the other two being the Bear Lake whitefish and the Bonneville cisco. The species is listed as a Wildlife Species of Concern by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. In appearance, it is very similar to the closely related Bear Lake whitefish P. abyssicola. Generally whitish in color, its nose is more tapered than that of the Bear Lake whitefish, and its scales are smaller. Younger fish, up to 10 inches (25 cm) long, have a pattern of spots which then fades. They have been reported to reach a length of 22 inches (56 cm) and an age of eight years. It generally inhabits mid-levels of the lake, where it primarily feeds on chironomid larvae and pupae, along with a variety of insects. The fish may also move into shallower waters, particularly during the winter months. Older fish also seem to be more likely to move into shallow water than younger ones. They spawn from mid-February through early March, over rocky or sandy areas. The female will stop to spawn, with 5-6 males in attendance, the total process lasting 5 to 15 seconds before the fish rejoin their school. While some are caught on hook and line, they are not especially popular with anglers. A number are caught by gill nets deployed at depths of 40 to 100 feet. References * * William F.

Hosted by Ed Phillips and Livinia Nixon, the show was a remake of Sale of the Century, which aired on Nine in the same timeslot for more than twenty years between 1980 and 2001. Temptation had the same general format of its predecessor, but with several new features and a deemphasis on the \\"shopping\\" aspects of the endgame. The show ran until 30 November 2007, when it was placed on hiatus by the network following strong competition from game show Deal or No Deal on the rival Seven Network; during the hiatus, Nine filled the timeslot with episodes of the American sitcom Two and a Half Men. When Ed Phillips made an appearance on The NRL Footy Show he announced \\"maybe summer\\" would be the return of the show. This statement was accurate, as Temptation returned for a shortened fourth series from 1 December 2008 with unaired episodes which were recorded during 2008. During that time, Ed Phillips was dumped by the Nine Network after his contract expired in November, and Temptation never returned to the schedule. After 23 January 2009, when the show's final episode aired, all Temptation websites were removed, and Two and a Half Men returned to Channel Nine's 7:00pm schedule. Format=Main game As in Sale, the game was split into four rounds. Contestants begin with a score of $20. When Edward Phillips asks a question, the first contestant to buzz in had the chance to answer the question; if correct, he or she gained $5; if wrong, he or she lost $5. Phillips revealed the answer immediately if the contestant answered incorrectly; no other contestants were given the opportunity to answer. Contestants needed not wait until Phillips had finished asking the question before buzzing in. Also throughout the game were several \\"Who Am I?\\" questions. Phillips read out a series of clues to the identity of a famous person, revealing facts which became progressively more helpful; the final and most helpful clue was the person's first name and last initial. As before, the first contestant to buzz in had the chance to answer the question; if correct, he or she made a \\"famous faces\\" selection (see below); if wrong, he or she lost no money, but Phillips continued reading clues and the other contestants were given the chance to answer. Round One: After the first three questions, there was a 20-second \\"Sprint\\" speed round. Immediately after this, the first Gift Shop of the night was offered to the leading player or players. The first Gift Shop item cost $6, and usually had a retail cost between $1,500 and $2,500; this $6 price could be reduced at the discretion of producers, or alternatively an additional cash incentive could be included into the prize, which was usually either $200 or $400. In any Gift Shop, if two or more players were tied in the lead, Ed would conduct a Dutch auction. There were a few more questions, and then the first \\"Who am I?\\" question, known as the Fame Game. Round Two: After the first few questions, the second Gift Shop was offered. This item was offered for $10, and usually had a retail value of between $3,000 and $7,000; this could again be accompanied by a cash incentive, or the $10 price could be lowered. More questions were asked, and then the second \\"Who am I?\\". After the \\"Who am I?\\", three more questions were asked before another 20-second sprint round. This ended round two. After round two, co-host Nixon gave the home viewer a question called \\"On This Day\\" where she told the home viewer facts that happened on that day. In the first two seasons (2005 and 2006) Nixon asked the home audience a question relating to the event on that day before the break and gave the answer after the break and then round three began. In 2007, only the question was given by Livinia, allowing the viewers at home to call in the answer by phone or SMS the answer overnight to win a $500 cash prize. Before the next night's \\"On This Day\\" question was asked, Ed gave the correct answer to the previous night. Viewers at home could then visit the program's website to see if they have won. Round Three: After the first three questions, the leading player or players were offered a chance at opening the Temptation Vault, at the price of $15‚Äîthis price was never reduced from $15 unless there was more than one player eligible, in which case a Dutch auction was held. Whoever opened the vault stopped the shuffling numbers for a cash prize of random value between $1 and $10,000; the probability distribution of Vault prizes was unknown, but values below $1,000 in particular were rare. After the Vault, there were three more standard questions followed by the final \\"Who am I?\\". Final Round: The final round consisted of a single 60-second fast money speed round. Famous Faces: Correct \\"Who am I?\\" answers chose one of nine boxes, identified by celebrities' faces. As before, most of the faces concealed small prizes, but there were cash values (also known as Money Cards) which were added directly to the player's score: * $10‚Äîpresent in all three rounds until chosen * $15‚Äîpresent in the second and third rounds * $25‚Äîadded only in the third round * Wild Card‚Äîadded only in the third round; gave the contestant either a $2,000 cash prize, or allowed them to select from the remaining faces in the hope of finding a Money Card. The new Temptation series had also added three special selections. All of these selections were present from the beginning of the game, however the Lock Out and Turbo were removed from the board in the third round: * Burglar‚Äîthe player could steal $5 from one opponent, which was then added to their own score. * Lock Out‚Äîthe player elected one opponent to be shut out; they would then be unable to answer any of the next three questions. * Turbo‚Äîthe next three questions are automatically doubled to $10, but only for the contestant who selected it. Furthermore, the penalty for an incorrect answer also doubles to $10. In each case, the next three questions were never part of a fast money round. This was also the reason why the Lock Out and Turbo items were removed from the board for the final \\"Who am I?\\". On occasions throughout the year, Temptation would break from its normal running style for a week and run a celebrity edition. In most cases these celebrities were playing for home viewers, where the normal prizes and money cards were present. Sometimes the celebrities would be playing for charities, where instead of small prizes cash donations to their charity were given (usually between $500 and $5,000). The money cards still remained. Bonus game A first-time winner was offered a major prize, worth about $10,000, and given the choice to take it and leave the show, or to return to play again. Gradually larger prizes were offered each night, leading up to a $50,000‚Äì$95,000 car on night five, all five prizes (roughly $130,000) on night six, a cash jackpot in night seven, and all the prizes and double the cash jackpot on night eight. The cash jackpot amount was determined as follows. Each champion has $50,000 placed in their cash jackpot if they chose to return after their first night. They were then given the chance to play \\"Top Ten\\". If they correctly answered ten of the questions asked of them in a 60-second segment at the end of each night, $50,000 more was added to the cash jackpot. The cash jackpot could only be claimed after night seven or eight (cf 2005 when a contestant could take their cash jackpot if they chose not to return the following night). Contestants chose one of five sets of questions to be asked. Passes and incorrect answers didn't reset the value at zero (cf 2005 below). Theoretically, the highest cash jackpot a contestant could win was $800,000.800,000 = 2(50,000 x 7 + 50,000) Original 2005 format When Temptation premiered on 30 May 2005, there were some slight format differences from later series: =Main game= * The Temptation Vault was offered in Round 1 for $10 (instead of the Gift Shop) with the value going up to a maximum $5,000. * The Burglar on the Fame Game only took away $5 from an opponent without it going onto the \\"burglar's\\" score. * The Turbo on the Fame Game applied to all three contestants, as opposed to the one contestant who selected it. This change was not made until 17 April 2006. * The Gift Shop was offered in Round 3 for $15 (instead of the Temptation Vault). * The value of the Wild Card was half, at $1,000. =Bonus Round: Ten in a Row= In the 2005 end game Ten in a Row, contestants had to answer ten questions consecutively within the space of one minute. The amount of cash won increased through a non-linear scale: *$100,000 *$60,000 *$30,000 *$20,000 *$15,000 *$10,000 *$6,000 *$4,000 *$2,000 *$1,000 Any incorrect, passed answer or questions that were not answered in three seconds reset the value to $0, and a contestant who didn't reach $100,000 won whatever value they had when time expired. In 2005, six-night champions could keep all five prizes or return for one more night. If a contestant won on night seven, then they would win all the prizes, the money in their cash account (which was not doubled), and $500,000 in gold bullion. Theoretically, the highest cash jackpot a contestant could win was $600,000 ($1,100,000 including the gold bullion).1,100,000 = 100,000 x 6 + 500,000 Carry-over champions would also be able to leave the show at any time with money won during Ten in a Row won up to that point in addition to the prize or prizes to which he or she had been entitled. The format for the bonus round was modified in 2006. First-night champions would automatically be given a $50,000 cash jackpot, which could not be won until at least their seventh night. The Ten in a Row segment was changed so that ten correct answers would add another $50,000 to the jackpot. There was no need to correctly answer the questions consecutively, but at least ten answers had to be answered correctly before time ran out. Grand champions Record-breaking champions which won since the end of Temptation: * Brigid O'Connor (Episode 18, 22 June 2005, $663,738) * Stephen Hall (Episode 63, 24 August 2005, $672,357) * Rob O'Neill (Episode 75, 9 September 2005, $701,241) * Yolanda Stopar (8 March 2006, $932,577) (First grand champion under the current format; biggest winner in combined history of Sale of the Century and Temptation; also set a record score of $135 on two separate occasions, the first of which was also a record $100 margin of victory over her opponents) * Tracey Korsten (2 November 2006, $857,655) * Blair Martin (11 June 2007, $603,002) * Sunil Badami (22 August 2007, $638,068) Specials Since its inception, Temptation has produced a number of special serials. Quizmaster Quizmaster aired from 27 March to 3 April 2006, featuring nine of the most successful contestants from Temptation, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and Temptation's predecessor, Sale of the Century, competing to win more money for themselves (the format is similar to the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions). 2005 grand champion Rob O'Neill defeated 2006 grand champion Yolanda Stopar in the head-to-head final by the score of $110‚Äì$80, winning $815,840 in cash and prizes. Other specials Special series were often run featuring celebrities, sports personalities, and former champions. The format varied from special to special, depending upon the number of contestants available, and some specials had seen celebrities compete in pairs. Prizes for these specials were either donated to a charity of the celebrity's choice, or awarded to randomly chosen home viewers.

It was established in 1998 and covers . The area consists mainly of bog but also includes primeval forests, some of which have been unmanaged for over 150 years. The Eurasian lynx is a permanent resident of Kurjenrahka, but brown bears and gray wolves have also been observed and are known to reside in areas within or close to the park. Marked trails in the general area extend to over 300 km. In Middle Ages the forests were jointly owned by the local parish. In early 1800s two manors bought them, but they had financially hard times and had to sell them to the state before end of the 19th century. Before selling, they logged clear all areas with easy access, but some islands in middle of mires remained unlogged.

Water cascades from a height of about 20 meters. It is in the Western Ghats. Here the river falls in two small cascades before joining again to flow as one. Location The waterfall can be reached by taking a diversion at Krishnarajanagar on the Mysore-Hassan highway. The diversion is on the left at the circle in the town of KR Nagar. A subsequent right turn on to a mud road leads to the waterfall. It is located at approximately 14 km from the town of KR Nagar. Chunchanakatte is the holy place where Lord Sri Rama during his vanvas stopped by and availed the hospitality of a tribal couple called Chuncha and Chunchi. The significance of this place is that the sound of the powerful falls can be heard all over except inside the sanctum sanctorum of the centuries-old temple, the story goes that Lord Rama was tired of the constant complaining of Sita Mata and gave a curse saying that the tongue of a woman should not be sharp and since Cauvery (river) is considered to be female the noise that the river generated would not be heard in the sanctum sanctorum of the lord. It is also said that when Sita Mata was tired and weary and wanted to have a bath, Lord Ram directed Lakshman to fire an arrow at a rock, once Lakshmana fired the arrow, water in 3 different shades started pouring out, one with turmeric, one with oil and one with shikakai (fruit for hair - natural shampoo). These shades are visible even today when there is considerable amount of water flowing in the falls. Before the powerplant was established, this place was like paradise on earth with nature at its best. Distances and importance It is situated in Mysore District at a distance of 56 km from Mysore, 14 km from K.R.Nagar. It is well connected by road. Buses ply between Mysore and Chunchanakatte. The place is not known for any amenities but one can find bakeries and small eateries and hotels at K.R.Nagar. Is very famous for sugar and also paddy. Chunchanakatte is surrounded by the Cauvery river, which goes to KRS dam reservoir. It is also a holy place for many Hindus, where they have Lord Sree Kodanda Rama who on the way to Lanka stopped here. This locale has been used in a lot of regional (Kannada) movies and has been a haunt for many of the film stars and politicians, most famous being Rajkumar. This region is mainly inhabited by farmers and employees of a local sugar mill and of late the power generation plant. Kodanda Rama temple at Chunchankatte Falls HistoryKodandarama Temple There is an ancient temple built here dedicated to Lord Kodandarama. The uniqueness of the idol installed here is that Sita is standing to the right side of Sri Rama instead of the usual left. Legend describes that Lord Rama during his tenure in the forests stayed in this place on the behest of the tribal couple Chuncha and Chunchi. It seems during that time there was not a drop of water here, and when Rama's wife Sita wanted to have a bath, Rama instructed his brother Lakmana to facilitate Sita Devi's wish. Lakmana shot an arrow on the rocks and water started gushing out in plenty and Sita Devi could take her bath. Also in this forest Lord Rama met Agnatha Rishi (Unknown Sage) and was impressed by his devotion to lord Narayana, so Rama asked the Rishi to ask for a boon and the Rishi asked Lord Rama that he desired to see Lord Rama with Sita on his right side. The boon was granted and so was the idol installed in the same manner. There are two Hanuman temples, one at the entrance to the temple and the other after the temple near the river. The most astonishing feature of this temple is that even though the falls beside the temple makes a deafening noise, inside the garbhagudi (Sanctum sanctorum) nothing of the roar can be heard. It is as though the falls does not exist. The legend narrated for this phenomenon goes like this ‚Äì it seems Lord Rama was tired of Sita Devi's constant complaining so he cursed that women should not talk unnecessarily and add to the noise pollution. Even though women till now do not seem to have been touched by the curse, river Cauvery's (who is considered a woman) roar at least is not heard in the garbhagudi of the temple. Chunchanakatte Kodanda Rama Chunchankatte Falls Cauvery flows into Chunchankatte roaring thunderously forming a 60 feet height and approximately 300 to 400 feet wide waterfalls. This place is situated 57 km from Mysore in Krishna Raja Nagar (K.R.Nagar) taluk, Mysore district. When the river reaches to cascade it is divided into two separate falls and joins again to continue to flow as one into Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) dam. The roar is deafening and the spray from the falls is refreshing. The gushing of water from every nook and corner of the rocky bed forms a milky white falls and the brown colored water in some parts of the falls shows the fertility that Cauvery brings along with her to the deccan plateau. At one angle you can see a large quantity of water whoosh to about 10 feet away from the jutting rocky bed before cascading into the river displaying the force at which it flows. This force is well tapped here and there is a hydraulic power generating station installed. It is in its best form during monsoon, but during seasons where there is less inflow of water, you can climb onto the rocks and explore more. From Mysore, drive down Mysore-Hassan highway and reach K.R.Nagar. Here, any of the locals can guide you to the falls. It is approximately 8 kilometers from K.R.Nagar. The falls is unsafe as water flow increases suddenly when water is released from KRS dam. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szqeahcr1Io Important events Brahma Ratotsava (car festival) is held on the day of Makara shankranthi every year. This day falls in January. The cattle festival, which is one of the biggest in this region, is held during January first week. Many water and shore birds can be spotted here. Good place to picnic.

The treaty was controversial in both Mexico and the United States. For Mexico, it was seen as a betrayal of the country by ceding rights to the United States, which had defeated Mexico in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War a decade before, but it promised the financially strapped liberal government the means to wage war against conservatives. The U.S. Senate rejected ratification of the treaty in 1860. Had it been ratified, it would have given major control over Mexican territory seen as a crucial transit point from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean.Charles R. Berry, \\"McLane-Ocampo Treaty (1859)\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 561. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Background The treaty was negotiated by Robert M. McLane, the US Ambassador to Mexico, and Melchor Ocampo, Mexico's Minister of Foreign Affairs.Edward J. Berbusse, \\"The Origins of the McLane-Ocampo Treaty of 1859.\\" The Americas vol. 14 (1958): 223‚Äì243. It was signed in the port of Veracruz in Mexico on December 14, 1859, which would have sold the perpetual right of transit to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the U.S. for $4 million through the Mexican ports of Tehuantepec in the south, to Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf of Mexico free of any charge or duty, for military and commercial effects and troops. It even required Mexican troops to assist in the enforcement of the rights permanently granted to the U.S. Melchor Ocampo Robert Milligan McLane Additionally, it granted perpetual rights of passage through two strings of Mexican land: one that would run through the state of Sonora from the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of California, to Nogales, on the border with Arizona; and another one from the western port of Mazatl√°n, in the state of Sinaloa, going through Monterrey all the way through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, south of present- day Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico was also compelled to build storage facilities on either side of the Tehuantepec isthmus. Of the $4 million for the total cost of these benefits, the U.S. would pay immediately $2 million to the Mexican government, and the rest would stay in U.S. hands in provision for payments to American citizens suing the Mexican government for damages to their rights. Although U.S. President James Buchanan strongly favored the arrangement, and Mexican President Benito Ju√°rez badly needed the money to finance the war that he was waging against the Conservative Party, the treaty was never ratified by the U.S. Senate because of the imminent civil war in the U.S., whose the northern, free states were concerned that the provisions in the treaty, in particular the free transit of military effects and troops through the isthmus would benefit the soon-to-become Confederate States if there was an open civil war. The U.S. hoped to build a railroad or canal across the isthmus to speed transport of mail and trade goods between the eastern and western coasts. Roads there and in Nicaragua and Panama already carried considerable traffic. Treaty provisions * Extending the Gadsden Treaty, Mexico agreed to grant the US a right \\"in perpetuity\\" to transit across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec * Both parties agreed to protect the region's trade routes * Mexico agreed to establish \\"ports of deposit\\" at both coasts :* Goods in transit from port to port would be subject to no tariff or duty :* Goods imported to Mexico at these ports would be subject to normal tariffs * Mexico agreed to grant the US the right to intervene at the request of Mexico, or in emergencies without, in the case of danger to the trade routes * Mexico agreed to grant the US the right of military transit, with due notice * Mexico agreed to grant US citizens the right of transit across Mexico by various routes * Both parties agreed to reciprocal and equal tariff policies * Mexico agreed not to grant other parties similar rights Legacy in Mexico For Mexicans who consider President Benito Ju√°rez a nationalist hero who defended the nation's sovereignty against the French Intervention in Mexico, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty gives fuel to Ju√°rez's critics who see him as not being so ideologically pure. Ju√°rez authorized U.S. ships to attack Mexican conservative vessels in 1860, prompting critics' charges that Ju√°rez \\"condoned foreign intervention and sold out to the United States.\\"D.F. Stevens, \\"Benito Ju√°rez\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3. p. 334. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. In the U.S. the unratified treaty garners little attention from scholars, but in Mexico it is the subject of major studies.Agust√≠n Cue Canovas, Agust√≠n, El tratado McLane-Ocampo: Ju√°rez, los Estados Unidos y Europa. 2nd ed. 1959.Salvador Ysunza Uzeta, Ju√°rez y el tratado McLane-Ocampo. 1964.
