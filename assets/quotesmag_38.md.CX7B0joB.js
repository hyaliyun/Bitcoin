Why U animated videos are designed to develop conceptual knowledge rather than procedural skill, i.e., instill in the viewer an understanding of the underlying concepts of math and science rather than promoting the memorization of problem solving procedures. The prime focus is to clearly and efficiently explain the conceptual framework at the heart of mathematical and scientific subjects in a way which engages the viewer and holds their interest.

As such, Why U videos are often used as collateral material in formal learning environments around the world.  Conceptual versus procedural knowledge  In recent years, there has been a shift in emphasis by educators from procedural to conceptual knowledge. One benefit of a strong conceptual understanding is that a person is less likely to forget concepts than procedures. ‚ÄúIf conceptual understanding is gained, then a person can reconstruct a procedure that may have been forgotten. On the other hand, if procedural knowledge is the limit of a person's learning, there is no way to reconstruct a forgotten procedure. Conceptual understanding in mathematics, along with procedural skill, is much more powerful than procedural skill alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúResearch has shown that students in a conceptually oriented mathematics class outperform students in a procedurally oriented mathematics class on tests and on measures of attitude toward mathematics.

Opened in 1886, it was the first Presbyterian Church to be founded in the City of Malvern and is now within Stonnington, a metropolitan area of Melbourne. The church is a congregation of the Presbyterian Church of Australia. A good example of Post-Federation, Australian Arts & Crafts architecture, it is in stylistic sympathy with the many Federation style houses in the area. The church became a hub of the district and the place of worship for many leading citizens of the area and reflected the self-confidence of Edwardian Melbourne. The Congregation produced three Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria and continues to thrive as a diverse congregation in a busy inner-east suburb.  Background  Malvern is one of several daughter churches formed by families from the Toorak congregation. Originally, the area was called the Gardiner Road district and developed from the 1860s as a place for wealthy Melburnians to establish large houses in a semi-rural environment. Commenting on this in 1925, the Rev Graham Balfour ‚Äì who grew up in Toorak in the 1870s ‚Äì described it as the \\"vice-regal\\" district, adding: \\"grouped around....beautiful undulating land, studded with magnificent redgum trees, were the homes, generally in wide domain, of the men who by industry, foresight and character, had attained wealth and honour in this young country. A large proportion of these were Scotch Presbyterians.\\" The Scottish and Ulster Presbyterian influence was significant. The closest Presbyterian congregation was a long journey to South Yarra and had been formed in 1854. A meeting was organised by two Members of Parliament who lived locally, Sir James MacBain MLA and The Hon. William Bayles MLA. This took place on 29 December 1873, with the aim to petition for the establishment of a nearby congregation, and comprised: \\"about 30 persons, Toorak and Malvern being about equally represented\\". This became the Toorak Presbyterian Church (now Toorak Uniting). For the next decade, Malvern and Toorak were one parish, but when the South Gippsland Railway was extended from South Yarra in 1879, the opening of a station at Malvern in May of that year started to transform the southern end of Glenferrie Road. A range of commercial premises and housing developed as the population rapidly increased. Large estates were subdivided to make way for suburban plots, and orchards and horse paddocks were developed into what was becoming a fashionable locale of spacious villas. From the early 1880s, the locality's Presbyterians started to meet in homes or outdoors rather than travel through to Toorak. = Original church = By early 1886, the Presbytery of Melbourne had agreed to establish a new site at Malvern. The Toorak congregation made available a gift of ¬£120 for three years if needed. Only ¬£100 of this was needed and the new congregation was able to purchase a block of land for ¬£700 at what is now numbered 108-114 Glenferrie Road . The wooden building was constructed and opened for worship on 10 October 1886.  Current church  Malvern Presbyterian Church in 1906 In 1904, after almost two decades of rapid growth in both the church congregation and the locality, congregation member Robert Haddon was commissioned to design a new building on a larger plot of land at 163 Wattletree Road. As an example of Melbourne land prices between 1886 and 1904, this larger plot was again purchased for ¬£700, but the valuable Glenferrie Road land fetched a handsome ¬£21 per square foot.Malvern Presbyterian Church, 1955 commemorative booklet, p 4 The church's foundation stone was laid by another congregation member, elder, benefactor and Mayor of the Borough of Caulfield Charles Duplan Lloyd. The old wooden structure was moved to the new site and used as a Sunday school, with the congregation using Malvern Town Hall for worship while their new structure was under construction. When finished, the new church seated 520 and was lavishly fitted out as a \\"total work of art\\" matching the architect's stylistic philosophy. The generous commission included provision for a fine organ, which was completed by George Fincham & Sons, Richmond and stained glass by the celebrated Auguste Fischer.The Argus newspaper reported in 1905 that the cost was budgeted at ¬£3000 and that Messers Angel & Bros of Malvern would be the contractor and John Sharpe would be responsible for the pews. In reality, the cost was ¬£4738 plus a further ¬£1800 for the organ. Malvern Presbyterian Church interior window tracery The church opened on Friday 27 July 1906, and was reported in The Argus in glowing terms: \\"The building, which cost around ¬£5000, presents both within and without a most attractive appearance. The pulpit and pews are harmonious with the general features of the building and the electric light has been installed. The acoustics are all that can be desired.\\" = Architecture = Church exterior in 2014, showing new access ramps The church is a good example of Arts and Crafts in an Australian context. While restrained, Art Nouveau elements are also evident and include tracery in the windows and vine motifs in corbels and other ornaments. The large auditorium measures 80 ft by 42 ft with a 56 ft transept. The sloping floor allows better views while large windows fill the space with natural light. Being a shallow site, two entrance lobbies flank the front of the building to avoid using more space and a shallow apse houses the organ pipes, which abut the lane behind. A choir room and vestry is to the left and a meeting room for the kirk session to the right. While retaining traditional features, the church is in keeping with styles emerging in Europe at the time.  Notable ministers and members  Rev Donald Macrae Stewart was joined Malvern in 1903. The son of a Free Church Minister from the Highlands of Scotland, he spurred the congregation on to construct the new church and served until his death in 1935. In 1915, he followed the young men of his parish to serve as an army chaplain in Egypt and then Gallipoli. In France, he served as a Chaplain Captain with the 6th Infantry AIF. in 1918, he was Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. He had the sober honour of laying to rest some of his own flock ‚Äì \\"our boys\\", as he said, \\"from our Sunday school\\".Donald Macrae Stewart - Records of his Life and Work, Edited by Rev John MacKenzie, Toorak and Rev William Thomson, Malvern, published by The Board of Religious Education, Melbourne 1935 p36 He was mentioned in despatches \\"for exceptional military service\\" for taking a communion service to completion while coming under enemy shelling.Donald Macrae Stewart - Records of his Life and Work, Edited by Rev John MacKenzie, Toorak and Rev William Thomson, Malvern, published by The Board of Religious Education, Melbourne 1935, p 43 Sir Arthur Dean, Kt, KC, Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and chairman of Presbyterian Ladies College, Melbourne was a long-time elder and superintendent of the Sunday school. He was made Knight Bachelor in 1960. 2nd Lt. Bruce Sloss 10th Machine Gun Company, First A.I.F, Promising VFL Footballer with Essendon and South Melbourne was a bible class teacher at Malvern. He fell at Armenti√®res in France in 1917.  War memorial  World War I memorial at Malvern Presbyterian Church In 1921, architect Robert Haddon was again asked to assist the church and designed a war memorial to members of the congregation. The polished Buchan marble memorial has a central plate with the 38 names of the fallen. It is located in the church's north wall, to the right of the organ. An honour-board of the 217 men and women from the congregation who served is in the east porch. The Earl of Stradbroke, also Governor of Victoria, unveiled the memorial in September 1921.  Chinese Presbyterian congregation  In 1984, the long-standing Chinese Presbyterian congregation from Little Bourke Street was looking for a new building and were able to settle at Malvern. A 5pm service followed by a meal was instituted in the Sunday school building to the rear of the church (the old church). For many years they met every Sunday evening, and soon became an extension of the congregation. The current 5pm service now includes many of the traditions brought by the Chinese congregation.  Refurbishment of 2007  Over the history of the congregation, various adjoining sites were acquired and used by groups. At one point a preparatory school for the Presbyterian Ladies College was accommodated on the campus. These sites were eventually rationalised and the church refurbished. The drive between the Church building and the adjoining house ‚Äì once a men's hostel and now a church hall and kitchen ‚Äì was built over to form a contiguous, flexible and air-conditioned space with better catering facilities.

The project was completed in April 2018. History The balancing reservoir initiated as part of SRSP stage-II for which the foundation stone was laid by the former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in 1991. The surplus water from Sriram Sagar Project flow through SRSP Flood Flow Canal (SRSP FFC) into Mid Manair Dam apart from Manair River water. Once the dam reached to full capacity, water can be released into Lower Manair Dam, a major balancing reservoir at Karimnagar city with 24Tmcft Gross Capacity. Dam construction was started in 2004-05 as part of Jalayagnam, but was delayed due to the several political reasons. 130 km long Flood Flow Canal construction work was completed till Mid Manair Dam. As Dam is under construction, the released water from Flood Flow Canal head regulator would fill Lower Manair Dam currently. For the project completion, it took 10 years to complete 50% work, and 10 months to complete the rest 50% in April 2018. The final cost for completing the project was ‚Çπ2050 crores. The Reservoir The Gross Capacity of the reservoir is 25.873 Tmcft. The Left Bank Canal 22 km to irrigate 9,500 acres. The Right Bank Canal 64 km to irrigate 90,500 acres. By June 2018, the Kaleshwaram project will feed Mid-Manair Reservoir with the Godavari water and stabilise the ayacut under existing projects. Earth dam breach On 25 September 2016, flood water flowed over the incomplete earth dam of the project and breached the earth dam inundating the downstream areas. Few villages were evacuated to save from water inundation. It was planned to store 3 tmcft water in the project to facilitate water supply under SRSP (stage-II) and Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project. It is not possible to supply water from the project till the earth dam is reconstructed. The project planning and its execution is blamed for the dam breach which has not constructed the earth dam to adequate level in comparison with the adjacent concrete spill way to safely pass the normal flood water without over topping the earth dam.

It rejected the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the concept of predestination, which had both been considered fundamental to Christianity since the time of St. Augustine and emphasized by John Calvin in his magnum opus, Institutio Christianae Religionis. Servetus argued that God condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. It also contained, incidentally and by way of illustration, groundbreaking views on pulmonary circulation based on the discoveries of Arab Muslim physician Ibn Al Nafis, that challenged the incorrect teachings of Galen.  Reception  After sending an early draft of Christianismi Restitutio to the theologian John Calvin, Servetus was arrested by the Inquisition in Vienne, but he managed to escape from imprisonment. However, he was later captured in Geneva and found guilty of spreading heresies. On October 27, 1553, he was burned at the stake in Geneva. Almost all copies of his book were burned shortly after its publication, although three copies survived and are currently kept in Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Edinburgh University Library and the Austrian National Library.Out of the Flames: The Story of One of the Rarest Books in the World, and How it Changed the Course of History, by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone. London: Century, 2003. p. 325.  Non-theological significance  Servetus' discussion of the pulmonary circulation in Christianismi Restitutio in the middle of the 16th century is often falsely recognized as the most accurate and complete description at that time. In actuality his work was likely based on the work of Muslim physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213-1288) who was the first to accurately describe the human pulmonary circulation and theorize the existence of capillary networks, some 300 years earlier. Since the information on pulmonary circulation was suppressed with the theological work in which it was embedded, the function of the pulmonary circulation was forgotten until published by Sir William Harvey seventy-five years later in his work De Motu Cordis.

The species is native to the southern regions of Africa. Etymology The generic name, Naja, is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word nƒÅg√° () meaning \\"cobra\\". The specific epithet, anchietae, refers to Jos√© Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta, a Portuguese explorer of Africa.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Naja anchietae, p. 8). Taxonomy The Anchieta's cobra was first described by Portuguese zoologist Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1879.Bocage JVB du (1879). \\"Reptiles et batraciens nouveaux d'Angola \\". Jornal de Sciencias Mathematicas Physicas e Naturaes, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa 7: 97‚Äì99. (Naja anchietae, new species, p. 98). (in French). The Anchieta's cobra (N. haje anchietae), along with the snouted cobra (N. haje annulifera) were formerly regarded as subspecies of the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje), but have since been proven to be distinct species. Based on analysis of character morphology, Broadley (1995) raised Naja annulifera to species level, with Naja annulifera anchietae as a subspecies. More research by Broadley & W√ºster (2004) using both analysis of morphology character and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) further confirmed that Naja annulifera was a distinct species, but data obtained also showed that Naja anchietae to be a distinct species of its own. Further research by Wallach et al. (2009) placed the Egyptian cobra (N. haje) complex (African non-spitting cobras) into the subgenus Uraeus. The group is distinguished from all other cobras due to the presence of a row of subocular scales separating the eye from the supralabials. Although the Cape cobra (Naja nivea) lacks this feature, it too was placed within the subgenus Uraeus. The below cladogram illustrates the taxonomy and relationships among species of Naja: Description The Anchieta's cobra is a moderately sized species of cobra that has a moderately slender body and a medium length tail. This cobra species can easily be identified by its relatively large and quite impressive hood, which it expands when threatened. It has a broad and flattened head, which is slightly distinct from the neck. The snout is rounded, similar to that of the snouted cobra (N. annulifera). The eye is medium in size with a round pupil. Adults average around in total length (including tail), but it is not uncommon to find specimens measuring between and in length. Maximum size attained by this species is just a bit over , but these are rare cases. The longest recorded male was long and was caught in Windhoek, Namibia. The longest recorded female was slightly shorter at and was found south of Shakawe, Botswana. There is no sexual dimorphism in this species of cobra, with males and females growing to similar sizes. Although like other cobra species, males will normally have larger heads and longer tails than females. Young specimens are yellowish to light brown in colour, above and below, dorsally with dark scale margins forming a pattern of irregular transverse lines and a black band that circles the neck. As they mature into adulthood, this species gradually darkens to a darker brown colour, while the band on the neck fades away. The ventral scales are often yellow with dark brown blotches, and the throat band, which covers ventral scales 12‚Äì23, turns blue-black. A banded phase sometimes occurs in the most southern parts of the species' range, black with six to eight yellow bands on the body and one to three on the tail. The light bands are often as wider than the dark ones. This banded phase has been noted in roughly 13% of males and up to 22% of females. Although Branch claims that the banded phase is more common among males above in length. =Scalation= Dorsal scales are smooth, shiny, without pits and oblique. Midbody scales are in 17 rows with 179‚Äì200 ventrals. There are 51‚Äì56 paired subcaudals and the anal shield is entire. There are 7 (sometimes 8) upper labials that do not enter the eye and 8 or 9 (rarely 10) lower labials, as well as 1 preocular and 2 postoculars. Temporals are variable, 1+2 or 1+3. Geographic range This species, N. anchietae, is limited to parts of southwestern Africa. It can be found in southern Angola, central and northern Namibia, northern Botswana, western Zambia and parts of northwestern Zimbabwe, with one record from Katanga, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Habitat The preferred habitat of N. anchietae is mesic savanna grasslands, particularly bushveld and lowveld. It occurs in semi-deserts and rocky areas, as well as in or close to humans settlements, where they may shelter under houses. It is abundant in wooded areas, especially along rivers and wetlands. This cobra is never found in forest or desert regions. Although usually found at low altitudes, it has on occasion been observed at elevations of above sea level. Behaviour and ecology The Anchieta's cobra is a terrestrial or ground-dwelling species, but it may occasionally be found in small shrubs. A nocturnal species, this cobra species emerges at dusk to forage for food, often getting into poultry runs. During the day it is often seen basking in the sun near a preferred retreat, usually an abandoned termite mound, a hole in a rock, hollow tree, and shrubs or under dense vegetation. The Anchieta's cobra is closely related to the Snouted cobra and the two species are very similar in behaviour, morphology and habits, though the Anchieta's cobra tends to be more aggressive when confronted by a threat, showing a tendency to engage threats longer than its close relative, the snouted cobra. This species, like other cobras, will lift its forebody off the ground, spread its impressively broad hood and assume a defensive posture when provoked, however, it will flee when given the chance. This species has been known to feign death as defence mechanism against possible predators or when it is cornered, although it does not display this behaviour as often as the Rinkhals (Hemachatus haemachatus) does. =Diet= This cobra, N. anchietae is a feeding generalist, preying on amphibians such as toads and frogs, other reptiles including lizards and other snakes, birds (including poultry), birds eggs, which it can swallow whole and mammals such as rats and mice. =Predators= The Anchieta's cobra is preyed upon by birds of prey, such as secretary birds and snake eagles and mammalian carnivores such as honey badgers. It is also prey to the white-throated monitor (Varanus albigularis). Reproduction Like other cobras, N. anchietae is oviparous, laying between 47 and 60 eggs in early summer. Hatchlings average between in length and are completely independent at birth. Venom Venom of this species, N. anchietae, is primarily a potent neurotoxin, but may also contain cardiotoxic components. As a species of moderate size with relatively large fangs, it can inject relatively large volumes of venom in a single bite. Although rare, bites have been known to cause human fatalities.

Hirsch (born 1949) is an American artist, curator, educator, historian, and author. He is best known for his writing about color and digital imaging and about the history of photography, and as an advocate for photographers who offer a haptic, expressionist interpretation of their subject matter. Biography and career Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1949, Hirsch has a BFA from Rochester Institute of Technology (1971) and an MFA from Arizona State University (1974). He is a former executive director and chief curator of CEPA Gallery in Buffalo; a founder of Southern Light Gallery; and a co-founder of Northlight Gallery, and has curated numerous exhibitions and public art projects. Previously, he was a professor of photography at Amarillo College, SUNY Buffalo, and SUNY Brockport, where he was also the director of graduate studies in the visual arts and associate director of the Visual Studies Workshop. Since 2000, he has led Light Research, a Buffalo-based consulting firm that provides professional services in the photographic arts field. Hirsch's work has been shown in over 200 solo and group exhibitions in North America and Europe, including at the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York; the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo; the Noorderlicht Photofestival in Groningen, the Netherlands; and the Stefan Stux Gallery in New York City. During the past decade, Hirsch's visual projects‚Äîsuch as World in a Jar: War & Trauma; Manifest Destiny & the American West; Unseen Terror: A Culture of Fear; The Sixties Cubed; and Ghosts: French Holocaust Children‚Äîhave explored the interrelationship of historical images with memory and time. Hirsch has rephotographed and recontextualized images into three-dimensional installations in order to investigate ethnic violence, genocide, religious intolerance, and war. In December 2019 - January 2020, Hirsch presented his new visual project \\"Mugs: Anthropometric Portraits and The Blurring of Social Identity\\" at the Indigo Art Gallery (Buffalo), which is said to \\"address the intersections of self-awareness with visual rituals, technological change, and justice in our digitally mediated world\\". Writings Hirsch¬¥s books include Transformational Imaging: Handmade Photography Since 1960; Exploring Color Photography: From Film to Pixels; Photographic Possibilities: The Expressive Use of Equipment, Ideas, Materials, and Processes; Seizing the Light: A Social & Aesthetic History of Photography; and Light and Lens: Photography in the Digital Age. Light and Lens has been published in Chinese- and German-language editions. His work, both visual and written, is signed as Robert Hirsch. Hirsch has published scores of articles about visual culture and interviewed numerous eminent photographers and curators. He has been the associate editor of Photovision and Digital Camera (UK), and a contributing writer for Afterimage, CEPA Journal, Light Work's Contact Sheet, Digital Camera, Exposure, The Encyclopedia of 19th-Century Photography, The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fotophile, The Handmade Photograph, History of Photography, Photo Ed (Canada), The Photo Review, Photovision, Photo Technique, World Book Encyclopedia, and numerous regional publications, including Buffalo Spree and FY. Critique The photography journal Afterimage stated, \\"Robert Hirsch clearly pitches Light and Lens: Photography in the Digital Age as an introductory college-level photography textbook that is foremost an idea book rather than a software or camera manual. In line with this philosophy, Hirsch ensures that critical seeing and aesthetic values are amply addressed alongside the technical. Thus, chapters on the history of photography, visual foundations, and symbolism lead off the book, and he closes with thoughtful chapters concerning seeing with a camera and thinking and writing about images. This emphasis is a refreshing and stimulating approach for a photographic textbook. Of World in a Jar, Richard Huntington, an art critic at The Buffalo News, wrote: ‚ÄúIn the jar installation, even with its staggering array of images, no image has prominence. That's because Hirsch levels the cultural playing field. Whether he's dealing with a Nazi atrocity, some appalling medical procedure, Frankenstein or Bart Simpson, he gives every image visual parity. But‚Äîand this is key‚Äîit is done with no cynicism, no black irony, no post-mod reductionism. He lays out these images as equals to jolt the mind into emotional attention. In Hirsch's hands the mixing of the trivial and the serious, the accidental and horrifyingly deliberate, make it seem that every piece is part and parcel of some overarching human drama larger than the sum of these parts.‚Äù Of an earlier work, The Architecture of Landscape, Jeffrey Hoone, executive director of Light Work, wrote: ‚ÄúHirsch gives the viewer a variety of issues, concerns, and techniques to think about and digest. He massages meaning out of every nuance in the series from the choice of subject to the scale of the images, and each decision that he has made seems to open up opportunities for further investigation.‚Äù Of Hirsch's recent exhibition The Sixties Cubed, critic and artist Bruce Adams wrote: ‚ÄúAt the core of this work‚Äîand perhaps of all Hirsch‚Äôs art in recent memory‚Äîis [Brion] Gysin's cut-up technique, which utilizes the element of chance in its random rearrangement of sentence fragments.\\" Hirsch, Adams wrote, created \\"a free-flowing account of a decade as seen through the images it produced, resulting in fragmented nonlinear multiple narratives. Hirsch sees this as a metaphor for 'how we live in a world of assembled fragments that unfold over time.' Of course, each time the work is mounted it results in a different random arrangement presumably evoking a multitude of spontaneous associations.\\" References * External links * http://www.lightresearch.net *https://www.routledge.com/search?kw=Robert+Hirsch *http://www.luminous- lint.com/app/photographer/Robert__Hirsch/A/ *https://collection.lightwork.org/Detail/artist/Hirsch%2C%20Robert * http://photo.net/learn/photographer-interviews/robert-hirsch/ * http://lenscratch.com/2014/03/robert-hirsch-transformational-imagemaking/ Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:American art curators Category:Arizona State University alumni Category:American male writers Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:University at Buffalo faculty ","title":"Robert J.

The thin, channelled dark green leaves emerge before the flowers, they are 5‚Äì25 mm wide (close to the base of the plant). They gradually narrow to an apex (falcate-like or lanceolate), and have a very visible white edging/margin. One of the shorter Juno irises, similar to Iris leptorrhiza, only growing to a height of . It blooms in early-mid spring, flowering between January to April depending on the weather conditions. It has 1 or 2 scentless flowers per bulb stem. The flowers come in a range of shades between greenish-yellow to pale violet. The green-purple perianth tube is about long. It has standards () that hang downwards. It has falls that start upright, but then the blade bends downwards, with a dark violet blotch at the tip. They have a raised white crest surrounded by a yellow zone/area. The yellow zone can sometimes have a dark purple ring around it. It has whitish pollen. Taxonomy It is sometimes misspelt as 'Iris narbuti'. It was first published as Juno narbutii by Olga Fedtschenko in 'Izvestiya Imperatorskago Obscestva Ljubitelej Estestvoznanija, Antropologii i Etnografii, Sostojascago pri (Imperatorskom) Moskovskom Universitete' in 1902. It was later published as Iris narbutii by Boris Fedtschenko in Bull. Jard. Bot. St. Petersb. Vol.V on page 157 in 1905. Iris narbutii is now an accepted name by the RHS. It is listed in 1995 in 'Vascular plants of Russia and adjacent states (the former USSR)' by Czerepanov, S. K. It may have been named after 'Narbuta Beg'(1774-1798), a grandson of 'Abd al-Karim' (Khanate of Kokand) of the Fergana Valley, Central Asia, where the iris was found.Ahmad Hasan Dani and Vadim Mikhaƒ≠lovich Masson (Editors) Native Iris narbutii is from Central Asia. Originally found on the slopes of Syr-Darya river valley. It is found on the rocky, gravelly slopes of the mountains of western Tien Shan and southern Pamir Mountains. Also seen near to Samarkand and Tashkent. Olga Fedtschenko had speculated that the plants from west Tien Shan, could be a separate species, due to their paler colour. In Chulbair Mountains, Uzbekistan, it is a threatened species and close to extinction. Cultivation It can be seen growing in the 'Le Grand Clos Botanique Garden' in Bourgueil, France. It can be cultivated in pots, or in well-drained soils in sunshine (like other Juno irises).

It records that Saint Peter defends his visit to Cornelius in Caesarea and retells his vision prior to the meeting as well as the pouring of Holy Spirit during the meeting. The book containing this chapter is anonymous but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this book as well as the Gospel of Luke.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 30 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Papyrus 127 (5th century; extant verses 2‚Äì5, 30) * Codex Laudianus (~550) Locations This chapter mentions the following places: * Antioch * Caesarea * Joppa * Jerusalem * Judea * Tarsus The vision of Peter, painted by Domenico Fetti. Ratification in Jerusalem (11:1‚Äì18) Some church members, identified as 'circumcised believers' (), objected to the reception of Gentiles into the church, using precisely the kind of 'discrimination' that Peter was warned against in (cf. ), on the issue of the 'traditional restrictions on table- fellowship between Jews and Gentiles' (as Peter himself referred in ), that was significant in the early church as written by Paul in Galatians 2:11‚Äì14. Peter emphasizes 'the role of the Spirit, the importance of not 'making a distinction' (verse 12), and the parallel with Pentecost (verse 15)' in relation to Jesus' words (verse 16; cf. ), and warns that 'withholding baptism from the Gentiles would be tantamount to hindering God' (verse 17) because each step in the development of the church is initiated by God. =Verse 17= : [Simon Peter said to the assembly:] ‚ÄúIf therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?‚Äù NKJV The words \\"them\\" and \\"us\\" emphasize the parallel of the two cases (cf. Acts 11:15), for just as faith existed before the gift of the Spirit in the case of Peter and the Apostles, so in the case of Cornelius and his companions there should exist a degree of faith, otherwise the gift was not manifested in them.Moule, H. C. G., Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. Philippians 1. Accessed 28 April 2019 =Verse 18= : When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, \\"Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.\\" NKJV This concludes the 'unified and tightly constructed episode of Cornelius' conversion.' The church in Antioch (11:19‚Äì26) Antiochia (Antioch) in Roman and early Byzantine times This section extends Acts 8:1 ('those who were scattered', following Stephen's death) as the traveling disciples 'speaking the word' (verse 19; cf. Acts 8:4) to wide regions (Phoenicia, Cyprus) and then focuses to the development in Antioch in Syria (c. north of Jerusalem). Here some of them started preaching to 'Greeks' (verse 20; Greek: , , \\"Hellenists\\"; some manuscripts, such as Papyrus 74, have , Hellƒìnas, \\"Grecians\\"), a development from earlier Cornelius episode. The apostles reacted to the news (verse 22) similar to that in , but this time they first sent Barnabas (introduced in ) who plays important roles as the liaison to the church in Jerusalem and as the one who brings Saul (or Paul) from Tarsus (verses 25‚Äî26) to spend a year quietly engaged in 'teaching'. =Verse 26= : And when he (Barnabas) had found him (Saul or Paul of Tarsus), he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. ::And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. NKJV *\\"Christians\\": This is the first mention of the term \\"Christian\\" in the New Testament‚Äîfollowed by second mention by Herod Agrippa II (Acts 26:28) and by Simon Peter in his first epistle (1 Peter 4:16)‚Äîwhere all three usages are considered to reflect a derisive element referring to the followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome.Wuest 1973, p. 19. The word is used three times in the New Testament, and each time as a term of reproach or derision. Here in Antioch, the name Christianos was coined to distinguish the worshippers of the Christ from the Kaisarianos, the worshippers of Caesar. Famine relief measures (11:27‚Äì30) The sending of help for the famine in Judea (during the reign of Claudius, 41-54 CE) raises up some historical difficulties: # The placement of the narrative before the death of Herod Agrippa I (44 CE; cf. ), seems to be in conflict with the date 46‚Äî48 CE given by Josephus (Ant. 20.101). However, Acts also records the return of the relief party to Antioch after Herod's death (Acts 12:25). # It appears to contradict Paul's claim that he visited Jerusalem only once before he attended the council there (Galatians 2:1-10; Acts 15). If Paul's first visit was the one recorded in Acts 9, then Paul would have made an extra visit to Jerusalem against his statement in , or it is possible the epistle to the Galatians was written before the council in Jerusalem (which clarifies why Paul does not mention it) and this visit is the \\"private\\" one mentioned in the epistle  See also  * Related Bible parts: Acts 9, Acts 10, Acts 15  References  Sources  External links * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 11 ","title":"Acts 11"},{"id":"43690790","text":"St Simon and St Jude, Castlethorpe Church of St Simon and St Jude Church is a late 12th century parish church in Castlethorpe, Borough of Milton Keynes (ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire), England. It was formerly a chapelry of Hanslope.'Parishes : Hanslope with Castle Thorpe', Victoria History of the Counties of England, A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 4 (1927), pp. 308-311. Of note is the Norman font with figures at the corners. It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966. History The dedication feast is kept on the Sunday after the festival of SS. Simon and Jude; though in old wills this is called \\"the church of Our Lady of Castlethorpe.\\" Architecture and fittings Interior view The church is built on an eminence, a little eastward of the keep, as appears from the height of the bank or mount still remaining close to the church-yard. It comprises a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, and a tower at the west end. The last appendage was originally high; but the rain having been suffered to destroy the timbers of the roof, it fell down in 1729; and being meanly rebuilt, was lowered about , and only the second of three bells, which it contained, was put up again. The large bell, weighing 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 18 lbs., which was broken, was sold together with the third, to Fenny Stratford, to defray the expenses of rebuilding the tower. The roofs of the nave and aisles are covered with lead; but the roof of the chancel is modern and slated. The principal entrance is through the tower at the west end. The piers and arches of the nave are very Early English, hardly removed from Norman. Two of these arches on each side, divide the nave from the aisles; those of the south side are supported by an octagonal pillar, and those on the north rest upon a massive round pillar, with foliage mouldings. Three decorated windows of three lights, one being in the east end, light the south aisle; and two modern sash windows have been inserted in the north aisle. There are three windows on the south side of the clerestory of the nave; none on the north side. The oak pulpit is square, and apparently of the time of James i.; the seats are open, and of deal. The roofs throughout are ceiled with plaster. At the east end of the north aisle still remain the steps of the rood loft, in a good state of preservation. On the south side of the chancel is a sedile of two stalls under semi-circular arches and a piscina. The font is very large, and octagonal, having two sculptured human heads annexed to two of its western angles. The chancel arch is pointed, and the chancel itself is spacious. The east window is a good Decorated one of three lights, containing a memorial to the memory of Caroline Walpole (died 22 February 1899). Within the communion rails are three flat slabs inscribed to members of the Tyrrell family; and on the north side is a stately monument to Sir Thomas Tyrrell, who died in 1671, and Bridget, his wife. It consists of an altar-tomb of veined marble on which are two black marble pillars, with white bases and capitals, supporting a richly ornamented pediment, with frieze and cornice, surmounted by an urn, and shields of arms. On a slab of jet covering the altar-tomb, between the pillars, are the effigies, in full size, of Sir Thomas, habited as a judge, reclining on a mat and cushions, his head resting on the lap of a female, sitting in a melancholy position. This monument, which was erected by widow Dame Bridget Tyrrell, bears an inscription recording the gift to the poor of Castlethorpe of ¬£10 per annum. There are also memorials to the Kitelee family.

It has an area of 6.1 hectares and a maximum depth of 5.1 metres. The majority of the lake belongs to the municipality of Seefeld, its south and west shores are part of Reith bei Seefeld. The lake is fed from the Haglbach, which rises below the col of the Seefelder Joch and empties into the lake in the southeast, and water from the bog of Reither Moor and other smaller springs. Its catchment area is just under 7 km¬≤. It is drained northwards by the Seebach which empties into the River Isar. On the east shore of the lake are small beds of reed and sedge; on the west shore mixed forest runs down to the lake. South of the lake is the Reither Moor, a raised bog resulting from the silting up of the Wildsee in which mountain pine trees grow. The south shore and the Reither Moor are a nature reserve. The Wildsee probably gave the village of Seefeld, first mentioned in 1022, its name. Emperor Maximilian I used it for fish farming and had lampreys introduced, which is why the lake also bore the name Lampretensee. The breeding of this fish, a prized delicacy at that time, only lasted for a few decades, however. Today, the Wildsee is a popular bathing lake with two beaches. According to limnological research, the lake has a low to medium nutrient content. Due to the bog-like character of the lake, visibility is only about 1 to 3 metres. In 2013 the water quality was classified as excellent.Land Tirol: Seefelder See The Wildsee is threatened by silting up as a result of the sediment transported to it by the Haglbach.

Terry Hirst was born in 1932 in Brighton in England. In 1965, Hirst moved to Kenya where he was to spend the rest of his life.  Life and Early Career  Terry Hirst grew up in Brighton in southern England. From an early age Hirst knew that he wanted to be an artist. He was always drawing and every morning as he made the paper run in his neighbourhood he would read through all the cartoons in all the papers. From the 1940s to 1950, Hirst's thoughts and attitudes were strongly shaped by political cartoonists from across the political spectrum, including Low, Zec, Shepard, Illingworth, Lancaster, Cummings, Giles and Vicky.Terry Hirst: The Trailblazer Editorial Cartoonist And Comic Author, Msanii Kimani wa Wanjiru, The Nairobi Law Monthly, 01 August 2014. But it never occurred to him to be a cartoonist. He wanted to be an artist. To the disappointment of his headmaster, Hirst turned down the opportunity to go to Oxford University and chose instead to take up a Fine Art course at the Brighton College of Art.Terry Hirst: The grandfather of local cartoonists, Joyce Nyairo, The Daily Nation, 04 October 2013. After he graduated he was soon appointed the Head of the Art Department at one of the largest comprehensive schools in Nottingham. While teaching in Nottingham, Hirst stumbled upon a newspaper advertisement for art teachers willing to teach in Africa. The choice was between Ghana and Kenya. Fueled by a sense of adventure, Hirst left England in 1965 to assume a teaching position at Kenya High School in Nairobi. Part of the reason he took up the position in Kenya, Hirst says, was because of a returning settler who had told him about what a \\"terrible time\\" he had had in Kenya. He had given Hirst a copy of Jomo Kenyatta's Facing Mount Kenya to show him what he had been through, but when Hirst read the book he says it \\"blew my mind...! It was about, not ways of having but ways of being and I couldn't even tell him that I loved it!\\" Hirst's decision to go to Kenya rather than Ghana was also influenced by the fact that the Kenyan contract was for two years while the Ghanaian contract stipulated a five-year commitment. To Hirst, five years sounded like it was too long.  Hirst as an Educator  At Kenya High School Hirst quickly proceeded to design a new art room, and with Peter Kareithi, the Inspector of Art at the Ministry of Education, he helped to develop \\"a new model of creative education.\\" Kenya needed a cadre of professionally trained art teachers for its expanding secondary schools and the five-year British model seemed like a \\"farce\\" in such a situation. Hirst helped introduce a two year course with an emphasis on teaching learners the essentials on materials, concepts and technique. Hirst was also a part-time lecturer at the University of Nairobi and working with Gregory Maloba, one of the few fully trained artists in Kenya at the time, he spearheaded the introduction of a three-year B.Ed Art Course. The new system proved to be a success with the first generation of students to graduate producing outstanding work that was featured in the internationally distributed African Arts magazine. In 1966, Hirst was \\"invited,\\" as he puts it, by the Kenyan government to head art teacher-training at the Kenyatta University College. There, again with Maloba, he helped establish the Fine Art Department.Hirst however notes that the new art teacher training course he introduced at Kenyatta College was bitterly criticized by Sam Ntiro at Makerere and even Hirst's erstwhile ally Maloba at Nairobi University. They thought the new course had departed too radically from the British art school model that they had enjoyed and favoured and which Hirst describes as a \\"farce... training people to be artists, and then expecting them only to teach, whether they have a vocation or not.\\" Hirst's course was quickly abandoned after he left. (See reference 3 below). Besides his teaching work, Hirst was also active in other areas of the art scene. He became a founding member of the Paa Ya Paa Art Gallery where he met with \\"some of the most creative minds of the ‚Äòindependence‚Äô generation.\\" He eventually contributed two one-man exhibitions of paintings at the Paa Ya Paa Gallery which both sold out.  The \\"Joe\\" Years  Hirst had already started to draw as a freelance cartoonist for the Daily Nation newspaper, when Hillary Ng‚Äôweno invited him to illustrate his regular Monday satirical column \\"With a Light Touch.\\" In 1973, two years after he started his collaboration with Ng'weno, the idea for a satirical magazine based on one of the characters in Ng'weno's column was born. Hirst and Ng'weno envisioned Joe as a magazine that would feature illustrated jokes, comic strips and short stories by local writers. The character, Joe, Hirst explains, is \\"a survivor who has to laugh to keep from crying.\\" The purpose of the magazine itself \\"was to comment on the news and to socialise people into being urban... to build a multiplicity of relationships... friendly but not involved emotionally.\\" To help make Joe a reality, Jonathan Kariara of Oxford University Press gave Hirst and Ng'weno \\"a room, a table and two chairs\\" so they could start work on the magazine. When the first edition of Joe came out in 1973 it was an immediate success, and the magazine quickly built its circulation at home and abroad. After a year, however, Ng‚Äôweno left to start the \\"Weekly Review,\\" a political commentary magazine. Joe meanwhile continued to grow more successful thanks to the popularity of comic strips such as Edward Gitau's \\"City Life\\" and Hirst's \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugali.\\" Short stories by writers like David Maillu, Meja Mwangi, Leonard Kibera and even Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, who were well known in Kenya, also contributed to the popularity of the magazine. At its peak, Joe's circulation reached 30,000 with copies going out as far as West Africa. And that was how, one morning, while working at the Joe offices, Hirst looked up to see a young Frank Odoi, freshly arrived from Ghana, beaming down at him with the words, \\"I'm here. I have come from Ghana to join you.\\" Hirst and his wife, Nereas N'gendo (who left Oxford University Press to work at Joe), were to run the magazine for the next ten years. Besides his work at Joe, Hirst was also doing editorial cartoons for the Daily Nation including the popular Hirst on Friday and Hirst on Sunday cartoons. Despite growing political repression, Hirst considers those years to be among the happiest, creatively, of his life. He felt independent and free, able to do what he wanted \\"from inner necessity\\" rather than financial necessity and he felt able to \\"draw and comment upon anything, and encourage others to do the same.\\" Unfortunately, given the increasingly hostile political climate in Kenya, the halcyon days couldn't last.  The \\"Pichadithi\\" Years  In 1982, a group of soldiers attempted a coup d‚Äô√©tat against the President, Daniel arap Moi. In the wake of the coup attempt, the environment for the media became very repressive. Joe closed its doors, Hirst was forced out of his job as an editorial cartoonist at the Daily Nation and his appointment as a lecturer at Kenyatta University College was not renewed. He fell into a deep depression. Sample of Terry Hirst's artwork. Forced to face the \\"usual artist's problem of how to make a living,\\" Hirst decided to awaken an old dream. It had always been his ambition to create a local comic book industry. Hirst was able to persuade a leading local publisher, Kul Bakhou, that an unexplored market existed and that it would be mutually beneficial to explore this market. The result was a children's comic-book series called Pichadithi which was a re- telling of African folk-tales (\\"hadithi\\" in Kiswahili). Kul's company, Kul Graphics, agreed to pay Hirst up-front on receiving completed, camera-ready artwork monthly, thus financing the completion of the next month‚Äôs issue. Hirst was originally contracted by Kul to do the first ten titles, which Hirst hoped would be enough to get him back on his feet, and it was. The Pichadithi series grew to be very popular with a monthly circulation of over 20,000 copies. Popular titles included Kenyatta's Prophecy, The Greedy Hyena, Wanjiru the Sacrifice, The Amazing Abu Nuwasi, Lwanda Magere, The Ogre‚Äôs Daughter, The Wisdom of Koomenjoe, Terror in Ngachi Village, and Simbi the Hunchback. Hirst's idea with the series was to stimulate the creation of a comic book industry in which the graphic artists had full creative control over their work while receiving adequate payment and retaining the copyright to their own work. After Hirst did the first ten titles, other artists like Frank Odoi and Paul Kelemba contributed more titles. But then, according to Hirst, the \\"marketers\\" took over, looking for cheaper artists, dictating editorially, and relaxing the graphic art quality standards, \\"and the series went down-hill.\\" A New Market For Comics After leaving Pichadithi, Hirst discovered a new market in the field of \\"development communications.\\" Hirst would receive commissions from government ministries, institutes, NGOs and other donors, for artwork for pamphlets, posters, comics, and documentary comic books, in subjects ranging from soil conservation and tree planting, to immunization, child health, sustainable development and zero-grazing. Titles that Hirst worked on include The Kenya Pocket Directory of Trees and Shrubs (a \\"bestseller\\" for Kengo), Agroforestry for Dryland Africa for ICRAF, and The Struggle for Nairobi, which is the story of the creation of an urban environment from scratch. Other titles include Where the Future Begins! a comic for girls later published in 11 African countries, Human and Peoples' Rights, a widely distributed documentary comic during the UN‚Äôs Decade for Human Rights Education 1995-2005, and Introducing the Constitution of Kenya, a comic book published in 1998 as part of a long-running campaign on constitutional reform in Kenya which continued with posters, wall charts and pamphlets. These titles were often distributed free of charge to primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities in Kenya, East Africa and Africa. One of Hirst's more notable achievements in the field of \\"development communications\\" was a 54-page documentary comic book called There is a Better Way which is based on the ideas of the economist Amartya Sen as embodied in his book Development as Freedom. Sen endorsed the comic book \\"with warm regards and great appreciation.\\" The book was targeted at university-level students in East Africa, but Hirst adds that \\"they could not get enough copies in Cambridge or Harvard.\\" Hirst did not draw anything from 2003 when his studio was accidentally flooded, destroying many valuable canvases. In his last years, he spent much of his time in his library reading and writing.

SLIM was developed by Richard D. Smith and coworkers at PNNL and are generally fabricated from arrays of electrodes on evenly spaced planar surfaces. In SLIM, ions move in the space between the two surfaces, in directions controlled using electric fields, and also moved between different of multi-level SLIM, as can be constructed from a stack of PCBs. The lossless nature of SLIM is derived from the use of rf electric fields, and particularly the pseudo potential derived from the inhomogeneous electric fields resulting from rf of appropriate frequency applied to multiple adjacent electrodes, and that serves to prevent ions from closely approaching the electrodes and surface where loss would conventionally be expected. SLIM are generally used in conjunction with mass spectrometry for analytical applications. Construction The first SLIM were fabricated using printed circuit board technology (PCB), and used to demonstrate a range of simple ion manipulations in gases at low pressures (a few torr). This SLIM technology has conceptual similarities with integrated electronic circuits, but instead of moving electrons we use electric fields to create pathways, switches, etc. to manipulate ions in the gas phase. SLIM devices can enable complex sequences of ion separations, transfers and trapping to occur in the space between two surfaces positioned (e.g., ~4 mm apart) and each patterned with conductive electrodes. The SLIM devices use the inhomogeneous electric fields created by arrays of closely spaced electrodes to which readily generated peak-to-peak RF voltages (e.g., Vp-p ~ 100 V; ~ 1 MHz) are applied with opposite polarity on adjacent electrodes to create effective potential fields that prevent ions from approaching the surfaces. The confinement functions over a range of pressures (<0.1 torr to ~50 torr), and over an adjustable mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range (e.g., m/z 200 to >2000). This effective potential works in conjunction with DC potentials applied to side electrodes to prevent ion losses, and allows creating ion traps and conduits in the gap between the two surfaces for the effectively lossless storage and movement of ions as a result of any gradient in the applied DC fields. The operating pressure for SLIM devices has initially been reported to be in the 1-10 torr range, and a range well suited for applications of ion mobility separations.

(English: What does the woman from Bahia have?) is a song composed by Dorival Caymmi in 1939 and recorded by Carmen Miranda. The song was immortalized in the voice of the Brazilian artist Carmen Miranda, who played this samba in the film Banana da Terra (1939), directed by Ruy Costa. Besides the film Banana da Terra, \\"O que √© que a baiana tem?\\" was presented by Miranda in the Broadway musical revue The Streets of Paris between 1939 and 1940, and in the movie Greenwich Village (1944).  Cultural references  From the beginning of his career, Dorival Caymmi musically imbued his country with a rhythmic, romantic identity that went well with Brazil's enticing geography and sultry, bikini- clad women. His first and immediately popular song, written at 16, was ‚ÄúO Que √â Que a Baiana Tem?‚Äù. That song became the first hit of Carmen Miranda, whose well-displayed limbs, extravagant hats and exuberant voice made her a global sensation as the \\"Brazilian Bombshell\\". In 1996, the publication News From Brazil said Mr. Caymmi taught Ms. Miranda to move her arms and hands with the music, which became her trademark. In keeping with the song's lyrics, Carmen performs \\"O que √© que a baiana tem?\\" wearing the costume of the baiana, a term which literally means a woman from the north-eastern state of Bahia but more specifically refers to Afro-Brazilian woman who since colonial times have sold food on the streets of Salvador in Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, and to the priestesses of the Afro-Brazilian religion, Candombl√©. Carmen, who had worked as an apprentice milliner and was a skilled dressmaker, stylized the costume herself, adding sequins and a small imitation basket of fruit to her turban, in a playful nod to the baskets of produce that the baiana street vendors carried on their heads. This stylized version of the baiana costume, with a shortened blouse that exposed her midriff, a figure-hugging, bias-cut, full- length skirt (eschewing the traditional baianas more respectable white lace blouse and hooped underskirts), and most memorably an elaborately decorated turban, was to become Carmen's iconic trademark for international audiences. The costumes created for her first Hollywood roles, like those show wore on Broadway and in nightclub acts in the United States, would incorporate the same key elements.  Legacy  In 2009, the recording was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress. The music helped to introduce both the samba rhythm, as Carmen Miranda to American audiences.

At least 7 people died in the operation. The dead included 3 officers and 4 militants.  Events  Russian police forces claimed that the operation was launched to kill militants in a suspected house. Russian authorities also claimed that the operation was to also eliminate suspected militants that take part in the North Caucasian Insurgency, which has been going on despite an end to the Second Chechen War. Amid the operation, the militants then barricaded themselves into the suspected house and a gun-battle soon took place. Russian authorities then claimed that during nighttime, the militants saw the time to attack with automatic weapons and grenades, and they opened fire on Russian policeman, killing 3 and injuring 5. However, the attack was repelled by Russian policemen. During the clash, 2 militants were allegedly killed as well, and the rest fell back to the house and were blocked by police. Several others were also killed as well. According to Russian authorities, 2 militants remained in the house, and negotiations were being carried out. Detectives were inspecting the clash site, and the police siege continued. On January 15, Russian special forces claimed they had cleared the house, that all militants were killed, and the dead bodies were being identified. The Russian police announced that the active phase of the operation was over, and engineers were inspecting the house to find explosives. Russian authorities claimed they found anti-personnel mines and homemade bombs inside the house as well. ITAR- TASS reported the gunmen put up fierce resistance. One of the dead militants was Marat Idrisov, who Russian authorities claim was responsible for a string of attacks, including a car bomb attack in Pyatigorsk. Russian media claims that he allegedly stole large amounts of money from a local businessman, killing religious leaders, attacked law enforcers, and was involved in organized crime. Another militant killed was identified as Rustam Dagirov, a local from Karlanyurt who supplied equipment to militants.

He is most known for reputedly producing the first recordings of American rock band The Velvet Underground while a sales executive at Columbia Records. Dolph reportedly received an original painting from Andy Warhol in payment for his work. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Dolph is a graduate of Yale (1960), with a degree in electrical engineering. While working for Columbia Records as an account representative in the Custom Pressing Division in 1967, and moonlighting as a DJ for his own mobile discoth√®que business (STOY, Inc.), he became involved in New York's vibrant art scene. Andy Warhol mentioned to Dolph that he had discovered a rock band he thought should make a record. That band was The Velvet Underground. Dolph bought studio time and oversaw the recording and the remix of the album that went on to become ‚ÄòThe Velvet Underground & Nico‚Äô. The album jacket features a banana picture created by Andy Warhol, and is one of the most recognized album jackets of all time. The album however, was not initially destined for fame. It was originally presented by Dolph to his Columbia Records colleagues for their consideration and it was swiftly rejected. The original acetate that held the recording was returned to Dolph who gave it to Warhol. It then disappeared for years only later to surface on eBay where it sold for $20,000. Though a commercial and critical failure upon release, the record has since become one of the most influential and critically acclaimed rock albums in history, appearing at number thirteen on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as well as being added to the 2006 National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.March 6, 2007 ‚Äì Recordings by Historical Figures and Musical Legends Added to the 2006 National Recording Registry, News from the Library of Congress, 2006 National Recording Registry ‚Äì The Library Today (Library of Congress). Dolph produced the 1969 album Switched-On Rock which capitalized on the previous year's success of Switched-On Bach by Wendy Carlos. For Switched- On Rock Dolph painstakingly tuned the Moog synthesizer which would drift out of tune every 15 minutes. In 1972 Dolph began writing lyrics & publishing songs, garnering two major Chart recordings, ‚ÄúLife Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me)‚Äù performed by Reunion, and ‚ÄúStay The Night‚Äù sung by Jane Olivor, and other recordings by K.C. and the Sunshine Band, Patti LuPone, Isaac Hayes, Millie Jackson, Tracey Ullman, Eddie Kendricks, The Earls, and Bill Medley. He also wrote the lyrics to the songs in the animated feature ‚ÄúAttila and the Great Blue Bean‚Äù. In the late 1980s Dolph, his collaborator Paul diFranco, and the recording artist Joey Levine, entered an infringement suit against McDonald‚Äôs, claiming an unauthorized use of an adaptation of \\"Life Is A Rock\\" in a commercial during a Super Bowl broadcast, and the subsequent pressing of eighty million flexible records bearing their version. That pressing represents one of the largest single pressing orders for copies of one record in the history of recorded music. The case was resolved out of court for an undisclosed sum. In 1990 Norman began to Paint. Inspired by Barnett Newman‚Äôs Stations of the Cross, he traveled to Jerusalem and photographed the 14 Stations. On returning to NYC, he spent the summer painting 14 stark, black and white pictures based on those photos. The paintings were originally exhibited in the 6th Biennale of Sacred Art at the Museo Stauros d'Arte Sacra Contemporanea (San Gabriele, Teramo Italy). He collaborated with poet the Rev. Mary McAnally, and published a book ‚ÄúSTATIONS ‚Äì Paintings and Poems of Spiritual Journey‚Äù containing the images of his paintings, a narrative of the actual walk along Jerusalem‚Äôs Via Dolorosa, and 50 poems. Additionally, during the 1980s and 1990s, Dolph was a columnist for Success Magazine, writing about software and topics of interest to entrepreneurs. Currently, Dolph is a Writer Member of ASCAP, and a Publisher Member (‚ÄúThe Four Moons Corporation‚Äù,) of ASCAP, BMI, HFA and NMPA.

The building was then used by several different occupants, the last, Valley Plaza Retirement Center, closed in 2004. History Fundraising began in 1917 for a 32-room hospital. Financed by the city and the Sisters of Mercy, and using land donated by the Catholic Church, ground was broken in December 1918. The building was completed in October 1919 and dedicated on November 4, 1919. The building was expended several times, including 1936, 1957, and 1959, with a final capacity of 100. Having outgrown the 6th Street location, the hospital moved to a 120-bed facility on 12th Avenue in 1967. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The entire block between 16th and 17th Avenues South and 8th and 9th Streets South is included in the listing, though only the hospital building and a grotto retain historic or architectural significance. Mercy Hospital is significant as an example of a community-based effort to build a modern hospital at a time when such a facility was unusual for a town of Nampa's size. Recent use The building was used as an office building, storage, and as a Head Start location in the years after 1967. It was remodeled for use as an assisted living facility in the 1990s that closed in 2004. The building has been vacant since then. In early 2006 there was a fire in the abandoned building.

He was a member of the Cuban art collective known as Los Once. Alongside Los Once, Viredo brought abstract styles to Cuban art that had previously only been seen in Europe or the US. Viredo's works include paintings, engravings, murals, and more. Viredo spent his early artist years in Regla, Cuba before fleeing to the United States to escape the Revolutionary regime.  Biography  Viredo was born in 1928 in Regla, a small town across the bay from Havana. He attended San Alejandro art school, founded in 1818. In 1952 he was invited to exhibit at the Sociedad Nuestro Tiempo in the show entitled, \\"Fifteen Young Painters and Sculptors\\". Only eleven artists ultimately showed work and the art critic Joaquin Texidor, in a favorable review in \\"Tiempo en Cuba\\", referred to the exhibitors as \\"The Group of Eleven\\" (Grupo de los Once), a name that followed the young artists for the rest of their careers. Other artists in Los Once include Agust√≠n C√°rdenas and Hugo Consuegra. The group's influence is generally considered to be significant as they introduced a new international style to Cuban art at mid century, particular abstract and non-figurative art. In 1965, Viredo decided that he and his wife must leave Cuba due to the political situation. In February 1969, he saw Cuba for the last time as his plane departed for Miami. Viredo's residency in Miami was short. He participated in local galleries and continued painting. In 1972, he moved to California and continued his work. Within 5 years he was able to do painting full-time, with Cuba as his subject matter. Viredo worked within the Cuban community, designed for the Cuban American Scholarship fund and donated art to raise money for charity. In the late 1990s and early 2000s he began receiving awards, like \\"La Palma Espinada\\" from the Cuban American Cultural Institute. On August 26, 2012, Viredo died of vascular disease at a Costa Mesa nursing facility at the age of 83. He is survived by his wife, Alicia.

The obverse of the half dollar features portraits of the first president, George Washington, and the president in 1926, Calvin Coolidge, making it the only American coin to depict a president in his lifetime. By the March 1925 Act of Congress, by which the National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission was chartered, Congress also allowed it to purchase 1,000,000 specially designed half dollars and 200,000 quarter eagles, which could be sold to the public at a premium. The Commission had trouble agreeing on a design with Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, and asked Philadelphia attorney, arts patron and numismatist John Frederick Lewis (1860‚Äì1932) to submit sketches.Brief biographical entry for John Frederick Lewis at pcgs.com (excerpted from Q. David Bowers, 1992. Commemorative Coins of the United States: A Complete Encyclopedia) These were adapted by Sinnock, without giving credit to Lewis, whose involvement would not be generally known for forty years. Both the quarter eagle, designed by Sinnock, and the half dollar were struck in the maximum number authorized, but many were returned to the Mint for melting when they failed to sell. The Liberty Bell reverse for the half dollar was later reused by Sinnock, again without giving Lewis credit, on the Chief Engraver's Franklin half dollar, which was first minted in 1948.  Inception  Legislation for a commemorative coin to mark the 150th anniversary of American independence was introduced on behalf of the United States National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission, which was charged with organizing what became known as the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia. In the Act of March 3, 1925, Congress both chartered the Commission and allowed one million half dollars and 200,000 quarter eagles to be struck in commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of American Independence. These coins would be sold only to the Commission, at face value; it could then retail them to the public at a premium. Profits would go to financing the Exposition. The original version of the bill, introduced in the House of Representatives on February 16, 1925 by Pennsylvania Congressman George P. Darrow and in the Senate by that state's George W. Pepper, called for a $1.50 gold coin for the 150th anniversary, for commemorative half dollars, and for a $1 bill honoring the Declaration of Independence. A hearing was held before the House Committee on Industrial Arts and Expositions two days later, at which Congressman Darrow predicted that the $1.50 gold pieces would not be opposed by either the Treasury or the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, but he was incorrect; Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon would not support them. The Commission also hoped to have commemoratives depicting the enlargement of the country through acquisitions such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Annexation of Texas, but these were not included in the final version of the bill. Nevertheless, the Commission continued to pursue congressional approval of the $1.50 piece and the other proposed commemoratives at least through August 1925. In May, H. P. Caemmerer, secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts, a body charged with making recommendations on the approval of coinage design, wrote to the Sesquicentennial Commission, asking what they proposed to do about the coins. Having received no reply, he wrote again in late August, this time to Milton Medary, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, asking what progress had been made. Medary replied that the Sesquicentennial Commission was in touch with the new Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, John R. Sinnock (his predecessor, George T. Morgan, had died in January), but that Sinnock had not yet submitted satisfactory designs. Apparently dissatisfied with Sinnock's work, the Sesquicentennial Commission hired John Frederick Lewis to create designs. Lewis, who served as president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts from 1906 until his death in 1932,Goodyear, Frank H. Jr. \\"A History of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1805-1976 (Resource Library, July 16, 2008) was known as a numismatist, but not as an artist. On December 8, 1925, Sesquicentennial Commission director Asher C. Baker submitted Lewis's sketches, which appear much like the present half dollar, to Fine Arts Commission chairman Charles Moore. Baker referred to Lewis's \\"designs for the coins\\", which may mean that he submitted sketches for the quarter eagle as well, but if so, they are not extant and were not acted upon by the Fine Arts Commission. The half dollar designs were approved by the Fine Arts Commission, on condition the sketches were converted into models by a competent sculptor, and Moore sent them on December 11 to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. The resultant plaster models, made by Sinnock, were submitted to the Fine Arts Commission on March 13, 1926, and were undoubtedly endorsed, but the approval letter is lost. Sinnock's sketches for the quarter eagle were sent to the Fine Arts Commission on February 27, 1926, and were forwarded to sculptor member Lorado Taft for his views. Moore sent his commission's approval to Grant on March 26, with several recommendations, including that the motto E Pluribus Unum, present on the obverse in Sinnock's sketches, and the sun's rays on the reverse, be omitted. The rays were not removed, and the motto was moved to the reverse. Approval of the models followed in April, again with minor suggestions.  Design  The obverse of the half dollar features jugate busts of George Washington, first president of the United States, and Calvin Coolidge, the president in 1926. According to Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, \\"both were mistakes. Washington was not president of the Continental Congress in 1776, and Coolidge's likeness was illegal. By an 1866 Act of Congress, no living person could be portrayed on U.S. coins or currency; but this law had been many times violated and would be again.\\" Although Sinnock had not previously designed a coin showing a president, he had created presidential medals under Chief Engraver Morgan's direction. Other living Americans, including Virginia Senator Carter Glass, have appeared on commemorative coinage, but Coolidge is the only president to appear on a U.S. coin in his lifetime. The Liberty Bell appears on the reverse, making the Sesquicentennial half dollar the first U.S. coin to bear private advertising‚Äîthat is, the legend \\"Pass and Stow\\" on the bell, for the long- defunct partnership of John Pass and John Stow, who recast the bell after it initially broke in 1752. Sinnock's initials JRS are on the obverse, on the truncation of Washington's bust. Swiatek and Breen describe the obverse of the quarter eagle as \\"very Art Deco\\". Liberty appears on it, wearing a liberty cap and holding both a scroll representing the United States Declaration of Independence and a torch likely intended to recall the Statue of Liberty. The reverse depicts Independence Hall, where the Declaration was signed, and the rising Sun behind it. Sinnock's initials are to the right, above the right wing of the building. Bowers pointed out that the depiction of Independence Hall closely resembles that on the Bicentennial half dollar, struck a half century later. As no clock hands are seen on the bell tower of the building on the quarter eagle, it is not possible to say what time is intended‚Äîon the Bicentennial half dollar, the time is 3:00. At the insistence of the Sesquicentennial Commission, the coins were minted in very shallow relief, and thus struck up poorly. Coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers opined, \\"from the standpoint of aesthetic appeal the [half dollar] is at the bottom of the popularity charts along with the 1923-S Monroe half dollar\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule took a more positive view of the two coins. Commenting on the half dollar obverse, he praised its technical aspects, showing the Mint had learned something from earlier attempts at coin redesign. He admired the reverse, calling the bell and the lettering \\"jewels of precision\\". For the quarter eagle obverse, with its figure of a robed Liberty standing on a globe, Vermeule suggested that Sinnock \\"revert[ed] in part to the allegorical iconography of the nineteenth century.\\" He felt that the Liberty allegory is too blatant, with scroll and torch, and noted that Sinnock eventually found a more proper place for his torch on the Roosevelt dime (1946). The figure itself, despite classical robes, \\"looks more like a 'flapper' of the 1920s. Her cloth cap accentuates this,\\" according to Vermeule. The reverse, in Vermeule's view, was part of a tradition of realistic views of structures on U.S coins that would repeat itself with the Jefferson nickel (1938).  Distribution and aftermath  The first Sesquicentennial half dollar was coined by Philadelphia Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick at a special ceremony at that city's mint on May 19, 1926. It was presented to President Coolidge when he visited the Exposition and today rests in the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Library and Museum. Lewis, in a May 5 letter to Mint Director Grant, had indicated his (mistaken) understanding that a mark was placed on the first 1,000 coins struck to distinguish them and proposed that it be \\"K\\" for Kendrick; this was not done. The Philadelphia Mint coined 1,000,528 of the half dollars at the behest of the Commission in May and June 1926, with the excess over the authorized mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1927 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. They also had the mint strike 200,226 quarter eagles in May and June, with the excess also set aside for the Assay Commission. The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the Panama‚ÄìPacific issue of 1915. No further gold commemoratives, of any denomination, would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984, when a $10 piece was issued for the Los Angeles Olympics. The Sesquicentennial Exposition opened in Philadelphia on June 1, 1926, financed in part by $5 million in bonds floated by the city. Work had not been completed on many of the exhibits and construction continued to the close of the fair. Nevertheless, there were many scientific, artistic, and commercial displays. Most firms that exhibited lost money by their participation, as did the city, and according to Bowers, \\"in the annals of fairs and expositions in the United States, the Sesquicentennial event earns a low rating.\\" Sales of coins at the Exposition were handled by the Commission; those by mail were dealt with by the Franklin Trust Company. The half dollar was priced at $1, and the quarter eagle at $4; however they did not sell well and the Commission's belief it could sell the entire mintage proved wildly optimistic. Although six million people visited the Exposition, 859,408 of the 1,000,000 half dollars were returned to the mint for melting. Similarly, 154,207 quarter eagles of the mintage of 200,000 were returned for melting. This did not take place all at once: 420,000 half dollars had been returned by January 1930, with the rest later. According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, \\"Philadelphia with a population of over 2,000,000 people ... could and should have sold a greater number of coins\\". Arlie R. Slabaugh wrote in his 1975 book on the same subject, \\"we have been called complacent about our independence and the American way of life in recent years‚Äîjudging by the sale of these coins, it must have been much worse in 1926!\\" Sinnock reused the reverse for the Franklin half dollar, first struck in 1948, the year after his death. Mint and other publications gave credit for both coins' designs only to Sinnock until Don Taxay published his An Illustrated History of U.S. Commemorative Coinage in 1967, disclosing Lewis's involvement. Taxay referred to \\"the Mint's ... final, deliberate misattribution of the artist who designed the half dollar\\" and wrote, \\"perhaps after these forty years, it is time for a new credit line\\". Bowers noted, \\"Lewis and Sinnock should share the credit.\\" R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (2015 edition) notes the involvement of both men, and values the half dollar at $90, with the quarter eagle beginning at around $450, though higher-graded coins may sell for more. Many specimens of both coins are known in circulated condition.

Work on the program began early in 1949, after NBC \\"decided to build a show around Martin and Lewis.\\" Billboard magazine reported that the network spent approximately $400,000 over five months getting the show ready. Preparation was worked around the duo's performances in night clubs and in the movie My Friend Irma. The basis for NBC's investment was a five-year radio contract signed in December 1948. The deal guaranteed the pair $150,000 per year and \\"a choice time slot.\\" The program was scheduled to begin Jan. 16, 1949, but it did not go on the air until April. Negative reviews Reviews of the program's first broadcast indicated that the episode left much room for improvement. A Billboard reviewer wrote, \\"Off the initial outing, the lads will have to do considerable improving to live up to all the web's hopes.\\" However, he offered some optimism by writing, \\"[I]f the scripters can come up with material as fresh as their style and talent, Martin and Lewis still may earn all the accolades which were tossed their way before they ever faced a mike.\\" Meanwhile, media critic John Crosby wrote in his newspaper column, \\"The general attitude was one of friendly skepticism.\\" In January 1950, Billboard reported that CBS \\"was making a determined effort to sign, among others, the comedy team of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.\\" The story added that at that point the program still had no sponsors and was \\"costing NBC close to $10,000 per week.\\" By the end of 1950, Jerry Lewis recruited comedy writers Norman Lear and Ed Simmons to become the regular writers for Martin and Lewis.https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as- tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/ Gains Things eventually improved economically for The Martin and Lewis Show. It went on to have sponsorship from Chesterfield cigarettes and Anacin. It gained popularity with listeners, too, as it was named Favorite Radio Comedy Show in Radio-TV Mirror magazine's 1952 poll. However, at least one newspaper writer still was not favorably impressed by the program. In 1952, Hal Humphrey wrote that The Martin and Lewis Show and Red Skelton's radio program were lacking in comparison to their television counterparts. He commented, \\"With rare exceptions their jokes and situations were stale and grisly with age, and on radio they had no chance to save themselves with mugging or pratfalls.\\" Format Martin was the singer of the pair, and Lewis was the comedian, with the latter described by radio historian John Dunning as a \\"squeaky-voiced idiot who heckled everybody in sight.\\" Dunning described the program's content as \\"standard variety fare: an opening song by Martin, some verbal slapstick, a guest spot, more Lewis antics, and a closing number by Martin.\\" Personnel Besides Martin and Lewis, regulars on the program included Ben Alexander, Sheldon Leonard, Florence MacMichael, The SkylarksTerrace, Vincent (1981), Radio's Golden Years: The Encyclopedia of Radio Programs 1930-1960.

Agrippin was the first named bishop, around 230 A.D. The temporal importance of the city of Carthage in the Roman Empire had previously been restored by Julius Caesar and Augustus. When Christianity became firmly established around the Roman province of Africa Proconsulare, Carthage became its natural ecclesiastical seat. Carthage subsequently exercised informal primacy as an archdiocese, being the most important center of Christianity in the whole of Roman Africa, corresponding to most of today's Mediterranean coast and inland of Northern Africa. As such, it enjoyed honorary title of patriarch as well as primate of Africa: Pope Leo I confirmed the primacy of the bishop of Carthage in 446: \\"Indeed, after the Roman Bishop, the leading Bishop and metropolitan for all Africa is the Bishop of Carthage.\\"Herbermann, Charles, ed. \\"Africa\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1913).Fran√ßois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 25 Dec. 2014) p86.Leo the Great, Letters89. The Church of Carthage thus was to the Early African church what the Church of Rome was to the Catholic Church in Italy. The archdiocese used the African Rite, a variant of the Western liturgical rites in Latin language, possibly a local use of the primitive Roman Rite. Famous figures include Saint Perpetua, Saint Felicitas, and their Companions (dead c. 203), Tertullian (c. 155‚Äì240), Cyprian (c. 200‚Äì258), Caecilianus (florit 311), Saint Aurelius (dead 429), and Eugenius of Carthage (dead 505). Tertullian and Cyprian are both considered Latin Church Fathers of the Latin Church. Tertullian, a theologian of part Berber descent, was instrumental in the development of trinitarian theology, and was the first to apply Latin language extensively in his theological writings. As such, Tertullian has been called \\"the father of Latin Christianity\\" and \\"the founder of Western theology.\\" Carthage remained an important center of Christianity, hosting several councils of Carthage. In the 6th century, turbulent controversies in teachings affected the diocese: Donatism, Arianism, Manichaeism, and Pelagianism. Some proponents established their own parallel hierarchies. The city of Carthage fell to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb with the Battle of Carthage (698). The episcopal see remained but Christianity declined under persecution. The last resident bishop, Cyriaque of Carthage, was documented in 1076. In 1518, the Archdiocese of Carthage was revived as a Catholic titular see. It was briefly restored as a residential episcopal see 1884‚Äì1964, after which it was supplanted by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis. The last titular archbishop, Agostino Casaroli, remained in office until 1979. Subsequent to this, the titular see has remained vacant. History =Antiquity= Tertullian (c. 155‚Äì240), a theologian of part Berber descent, was instrumental in the development of trinitarian theology, and was the first to apply Latin language extensively in his theological writings. As such, Tertullian has been called \\"the father of Latin Christianity\\" and \\"the founder of Western theology.\\"  Earliest bishops  Cyprian of Carthage, Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus, bishop of Carthage, Church Father, died in martyrdom in 258. In Christian traditions, some accounts give as the first bishop of Carthage Crescens, ordained by Saint Peter, or Speratus, one of the Scillitan Martyrs. Epenetus of Carthage is found in Pseudo-Dorotheus and Pseudo- Hippolytus lists of seventy disciples. The account of the martyrdom of Saint Perpetua and her companions in 203 mentions an Optatus who is generally taken to have been bishop of Carthage, but who may instead have been bishop of Thuburbo Minus. The first certain historically documented bishop of Carthage is Agrippinus around the 230s. Also historically certain is Donatus, the immediate predecessor of Cyprian (249‚Äì258). Gams \\"ignored a number of scattered dissertations which would have rectified, on a multitude of points, his uncertain chronology\\" and Leclercq suggests that \\"larger information must be sought in extensive documentary works.\\" ()  Primacy  Ruins of the Basilica called of Saint Cyprian, discovered in 1915. Saint Perpetua and Saint Felicitas. Ruins of the Basilica of Damous El Karita, the largest church building in Carthage, ornamented with more than 100 columns. In the 3rd century, at the time of Cyprian, the bishops of Carthage exercised a real though not formalized primacy in the Early African Church. not only in the Roman province of Proconsular Africa in the broadest sense (even when it was divided into three provinces through the establishment of Byzacena and Tripolitania), but also, in some supra-metropolitan form, over the Church in Numidia and Mauretania. The provincial primacy was associated with the senior bishop in the province rather than with a particular see and was of little importance in comparison to the authority of the bishop of Carthage, who could be appealed to directly by the clergy of any province.  Division  Cyprian faced opposition within his own diocese over the question of the proper treatment of the lapsi who had fallen away from the Christian faith under persecution. Transcribed from More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the Council of Carthage (256). A division in the church that came to be known as the Donatist controversy began in 313 among Christians in North Africa. The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor Diocletian. The Donatists also opposed the involvement of Emperor Constantine in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition. The occasionally violent controversy has been characterized as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was Augustine, bishop of Hippo Regius. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was Christ. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of Orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in the Council of Carthage (411), Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.  Successors of Cyprian until before the Vandal invasion  The immediate successors of Cyprian were Lucianus and Carpophorus, but there is disagreement about which of the two was earlier. A bishop Cyrus, mentioned in a lost work by Augustine, is placed by some before, by others after, the time of Cyprian. There is greater certainty about the 4th-century bishops: Mensurius, bishop by 303, succeeded in 311 by Caecilianus, who was at the First Council of Nicaea and who was opposed by the Donatist bishop Majorinus (311‚Äì315). Rufus participated in an anti-Arian council held in Rome in 337 or 340 under Pope Julius I. He was opposed by Donatus Magnus, the true founder of Donatism. Gratus (344‚Äì ) was at the Council of Sardica and presided over the Council of Carthage (349). He was opposed by Donatus Magnus and, after his exile and death, by Parmenianus, whom the Donatists chose as his successor. Restitutus accepted the Arian formula at the Council of Rimini in 359 but later repented. Genethlius presided over two councils at Carthage, the second of which was held in 390. By the end of the 4th century, the settled areas had become Christianized, and some Berber tribes had converted en masse. The next bishop was Saint Aurelius, who in 421 presided over another council at Carthage and was still alive in 426. His Donatist opponent was Primianus, who had succeeded Parmenianus in about 391. A dispute between Primian and Maximian, a relative of Donatus, resulted in the largest Maximian schism within the Donatist movement.  Bishops under the Vandals  Capreolus was bishop of Carthage when the Vandals conquered the province. Unable for that reason to attend the Council of Ephesus in 431 as chief bishop of Africa, he sent his deacon Basula or Bessula to represent him. In about 437, he was succeeded by Quodvultdeus, whom Gaiseric exiled and who died in Naples. A 15-year vacancy followed, and it was only in 454 that Saint Deogratias was ordained bishop of Carthage. He died at the end of 457 or the beginning of 458, and Carthage remained without a bishop for another 24 years. Saint Eugenius was consecrated in around 481, exiled, along with other Catholic bishops, by Huneric in 484, recalled in 487, but in 491 forced to flee to Albi in Gaul, where he died. When the Vandal persecution ended in 523, Bonifacius became bishop of Carthage and held a Council in 525. =Middle Ages= Praetorian prefecture of Africa The Eastern Roman Empire established its praetorian prefecture of Africa after the reconquest of northwestern Africa during the Vandalic War 533‚Äì534. Bonifacius was succeeded by Reparatus, who held firm in the Three Chapters Controversy and in 551 was exiled to Pontus, where he died. He was replaced by Primosus, who accepted the emperor's wishes on the controversy. He was represented at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 by the bishop of Tunis. Publianus was bishop of Carthage from before 566 to after 581. Dominicus is mentioned in letters of Pope Gregory the Great between 592 and 601. Fortunius lived at the time of Pope Theodore I (c. 640) and went to Constantinople in the time of Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople (641 to 653). Victor became bishop of Carthage in 646. Islamic conquest of Mahgreb  Last resident bishops  At the beginning of the 8th century and at the end of the 9th, Carthage still appears in lists of dioceses over which the Patriarch of Alexandria claimed jurisdiction. Two letters of Pope Leo IX on 27 December 1053 show that the diocese of Carthage was still a residential see. The texts are given in the Patrologia Latina of Migne. They were written in reply to consultations regarding a conflict between the bishops of Carthage and Gummi about who was to be considered the metropolitan, with the right to convoke a synod. In each of the two letters, the pope laments that, while in the past Carthage had had a church council of 205 bishops, the number of bishops in the whole territory of Africa was now reduced to five, and that, even among those five, there was jealousy and contention. However, he congratulated the bishops to whom he wrote for submitting the question to the Bishop of Rome, whose consent was required for a definitive decision. The first of the two letters (Letter 83 of the collection) is addressed to Thomas, Bishop of Africa, whom Mesnages deduces to have been the bishop of Carthage. The other letter (Letter 84 of the collection) is addressed to Bishops Petrus and Ioannes, whose sees are not mentioned, and whom the pope congratulates for having supported the rights of the see of Carthage. In each of the two letters, Pope Leo declares that, after the Bishop of Rome, the first archbishop and chief metropolitan of the whole of Africa is the bishop of Carthage,Primus archiepiscopus et totius Africae maximus metropolitanus est Carthaginiensis episcopus while the bishop of Gummi, whatever his dignity or power, will act, except for what concerns his own diocese, like the other African bishops, by consultation with the archbishop of Carthage. In the letter addressed to Petrus and Ioannes, Pope Leo adds to his declaration of the position of the bishop of Carthage the eloquent declaration: \\"... nor can he, for the benefit of any bishop in the whole of Africa lose the privilege received once for all from the holy Roman and apostolic see, but he will hold it until the end of the world as long as the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is invoked there, whether Carthage lie desolate or whether it some day rise glorious again\\".nec pro aliquo episcopo in tota Africa potest perdere privilegium semel susceptum a sancta Romana et apostolica sede: sed obtinebit illud usque in finem saeculi, et donec in ea invocabitur nomen Domini nostri Iesu Christi, sive deserta iaceat Carthago, sive gloriosa resurgat aliquando When in the 19th century the residential see of Carthage was for a while restored, Cardinal Charles-Martial-Allemand Lavigerie had these words inscribed in letters of gold beneath the dome of his great cathedral. The building now belongs the Tunisian state and is used for concerts. Later, an archbishop of Carthage named Cyriacus was imprisoned by the Arab rulers because of an accusation by some Christians. Pope Gregory VII wrote him a letter of consolation, repeating the hopeful assurances of the primacy of the Church of Carthage, \\"whether the Church of Carthage should still lie desolate or rise again in glory\\". By 1076, Cyriacus was set free, but there was only one other bishop in the province. These are the last of whom there is mention in that period of the history of the see.Fran√ßois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 2011) p200. Decline After the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, the church gradually died out along with the local Latin dialect. The Islamization of Christian appears to have been quick and the Arab authors paid scant attention to them. Christan graves inscribed with Latin and dated to 10th-11th centuries are known. By the end of 10th century, the number of bishoprics in the Maghreb region was 47 including 10 in southern Tunsia. In 1053, Pope Leo IX commented that only five bishoprics were left in Africa.Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten By Heinz Halm, page 99 Some primary accounts including Arabic ones in 10th century mention persecutions of the Church and measures undertaken by Muslim rulers to suppress it. A schism among the African churches developed by the time of Pope Formosus. In 980, Christians of Carthage contacted Pope Benedict VII, asking to declare Jacob as an archbishop. Leo IX declared the bishop of Carthage as the \\"first archbishop and metropolitan of all Africa\\" when a bishop of Gummi in Byzacena declared the region a metropolis. By the time of Gregory VII, the Church was unable to appoint a bishop which traditionally would have only required presence of three other bishops. This was likely due to persecutions and possibly other churches breaking off their communion with Carthage. In 1152, the Muslim rulers ordered the Christians of Tunisia to convert or face death. The only African bishopric mentioned in a list in 1192 published by the Catholic Church in Rome was that of Carthage.Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition By David E. Wilhite, page 332-334 Native Christianity is attested in the 15th century, though it was not in communion in with the Catholic church. The bishop of Morocco Lope Fernandez de Ain was made the head of the Church of Africa, the only church officially allowed to preach in the continent, on 19 December 1246 by Pope Innocent IV., page 103-104 Titular see of Carthage Today, Archdiocese of Carthage remain as a titular see of the Catholic Church, albeit vacant. The equivalent contemporary entity for the historical geography in continuous operation would be the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis, established in 1884.

He is the son of Adel Abdel Bari who confessed to murdering 224 people in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Africa. After circulation of video footage related to the decapitation of the American journalist James Foley, British intelligence reportedly centred on three suspects who might be the militant in the footage dubbed \\"Jihadi John\\", putting a knife to Foley's throat and later on boasting of having undertaken his beheading. Abdel Bary attained considerable notoriety as he emerged as a prime suspect in the hunt for \\"Jihadi John\\",The Independent: 'Jihadi John': Identity of Isis militant who beheaded Steven Sotloff and James Foley remains a mystery but in February 2015, it was reported that the executioner was Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. During his ISIS activities Bary posed with a severed head and declared war on the West. Father Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is the son of Ragaa and Adel Abdel Bari. His father was arrested when Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was six years old. His father was reportedly tortured in Egypt as a suspected radical Islamist. After release, he moved to the United Kingdom where he applied for political asylum with his wife and family. After a very long process of investigation, with the possible returning of Adel Abdel Bari to Egypt, he was extradited eventually by the British authorities to the United States in 2012 for involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and for having alleged links and a longtime association with Osama bin Laden and more prominently Ayman al-Zawahiri, current leader of al Qaeda. On 6 February 2015, Adel Abdel Bari pleaded guilty to 213 pre meditated murders and was sentenced to 25 years in prison - the plea bargain was described by the judge as generous. Early life and music career Abdel Bary grew up in a council house in Maida Vale in West London. Abdel Bary released a number of recordings online about his own life as a youth in London. In lyrics for earlier releases online going back to 2012, Bary made apparent references to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talked about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt due to his father's terrorist activity. He also appeared in SBTV Warmup Sessions as Lyricist Jinn presenting two live tracks that talked about his experiences. In later songs however, references to cannabis use stopped in his lyrics to be replaced with more radical tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families. He was also part of a rap group known as \\"The Black Triangle\\". As a rapper he was known as Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny. Known tracks by him include \\"Overdose\\" (the only one uploaded, now removed, to his YouTube channel LJinnyVEVO), \\"Flying High\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"The Beginning\\", and \\"Dog Pound.\\" Some of his recordings were reportedly played on BBC Radio 1\\\\. As late as 1 December 2013, music featuring L. Jinny was still being released including the track \\"My Words\\" featuring L Jinny on the album More True Talk by Logic & Last Resort. Radicalisation Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was radicalised by Muslim groups connected to preacher Anjem Choudary in England. On 1 July 2013, he reportedly announced that he was giving up his musical aspirations for Islam. \\"I have left everything for the sake of Allah\\", he said, walking out of his family's home in Maida Vale in Westminster, leaving behind his mother Ragaa and his five siblings. ISIS activities In 2013, Bary joined the jihadist opposition forces in Syria fighting the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. In March 2014, he had a run-in with rival Free Syrian Army opposition forces, claiming in a tweet that he was kidnapped and tortured by them. He eventually joined the even more radical Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL). In June 2014, The Sunday Times revealed a threat made by Bary on Twitter saying: \\"The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon.\\" In early August 2014, he posted a photograph of himself holding a man's severed head allegedly taken in Raqqa, Syria, the stronghold of ISIL and declared capital for the ISIL self-proclaimed Islamic State. The caption read: \\"Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him.\\" The Sunday Times and Sunday People listed Bary as a member of a group of four British-born ISIL members that have guarded, tortured, and beheaded foreign hostages in Syria, a group they called \\"The Beatles\\" (\\"John\\", \\"George\\", \\"Paul\\", and \\"Ringo\\") because of their British accents. He was suspected of being the \\"Jihadi John\\" appearing in the execution video of James Foley. However, a representative of Scotland Yard told Billboard magazine in August 2014 that the man in the video had not definitively been identified. In February 2015, it was confirmed that \\"Jihadi John\\" is not Abdel Bary, but actually Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born man in his mid-20s who had left West London to join ISIS. In 2014, his family home in London was raided by the British police which provoked a strong reaction from him on social media. He wrote on his Twitter account: \\"They have nothing to do with this, they did not even know where I am. I haven't lived at home for years you pagans.\\" Bary kept an online presence using the name Abu Klashnikov on Twitter, but his account was eventually suspended. Bary also claimed that he and Junaid Hussain were kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of a rival Islamic terror group. In July 2015, it was reported that Bary was on the run in Turkey, after having left ISIS. He disguised himself as a refugee and escaped during the ISIS retreat from Tal Abyad in June 2015, Bary shortly returned on Twitter as @LJinnay where he spoke to his former friends and fans, but then deleted it after one week. He has not been heard from since, now being sought by both the British security services and by ISIL executioners, who have recently killed scores of foreign fighters for deserting their ranks, according to British security sources. As of December 2017, it was reported that Bary was apparently still alive and perhaps wishing to return to Britain. Bary briefly reuploaded videos to his LJinnyVEVO channel in late July 2017, but he is believed to have carried his refugee disguise into Europe. His inactivity on social media may be a result of his attempts to keep a low profile. On 21 April 2020, he was arrested in Almer√≠a with two other terrorists, in an operation lead by the Spanish police and intelligence agency that knew he had entered Spanish soil illegally in a dinghy.

Biography  His father was a fisherman and farmer who served as mayor of Concarneau for fifteen years.Museum of Pont Aven: Exhibition notes with biography. (Cached) He received his first art lessons from the lithographer Th√©odore Le Monnier (1815‚Äì1888), who was visiting Concarneau. On his advice, Guillou moved to Paris in 1862, where he attended the Acad√©mie Suisse for a short time, then found a position in the workshop of Alexandre Cabanel. While there, he met Jules Bastien-Lepage, Fernand Cormon and Th√©ophile Deyrolle, who he convinced to give up architecture and join him at Cabanel's. He debuted at the Salon in 1868 with his Young Breton Fisherman. Three years later, he and his friend Deyrolle left Paris for Concarneau, with nothing more than they could carry on their backs. The following year, Deyrolle married Guillou's sister Suzanne. Together, they created the Concarneau Art Colony, which benefitted from its proximity to Pont-Aven, where Paul Gauguin and his followers congregated. He also exhibited works at both the 1889 and 1900 Universal Exhibitions in Paris where he received silver medals. Goodbye! (1892; Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Quimper). After his marriage to the daughter of the engraver Joseph Gabriel Tourny (1817‚Äì1880), he maintained a home in Montparnasse, but spent as much time as possible in his hometown. Following his father's death in 1887, he built a home and workshop there, became involved in local politics and joined the board of the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Quimper. Over the years, the Colony attracted many artists who were either interested in maritime subjects or wanted to achieve a sort of primitivism; represented for them by the traditions of the Breton people, which had survived mostly intact from an earlier period. Among the better-known artists who spent time there were Peder Severin Kr√∏yer, Charles Cottet, Jules Bastien- Lepage, Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret, Am√©lie Lundahl, Cecilia Beaux and T.

Wonder, the seventh film in The Good Witch film series, premiered on Hallmark Channel on October 25, 2014. Plot Cassie Russell (Catherine Bell) is given little time to plan her stepson Brandon's (Matthew Knight) wedding to Tara (Ashley Leggat). In addition, Martha (Catherine Disher), Middleton's new mayor, wants Cassie to head a silent auction fundraiser for the Middleton Botanical Gardens. When Audrey (Rachel Wilson) arrives in town looking for a job, Cassie hires her to work in her store, Bell, Book & Candle. Audrey even offers to help with the auction. However, Cassie becomes suspicious when items for the auction go missing. She must use her powers, and the help of Martha and husband/police chief Jake (Chris Potter), to uncover the truth. Meanwhile, Lori (Hannah Endicott-Douglas), now a college student and a fellow writer on the newspaper, is desperate to find a date to her brother's wedding. Jim (Connor Price), the editor of the newspaper, likes Lori, but Lori herself doesn't know that Jim really likes her. He goes out of his way by crashing her dates and ultimately giving her a hard time to show his true feelings for her. Lori finally learns of this and tells Jim that she's not just looking for a date to her brother's wedding, but what she was really looking for was really a boyfriend. The two share their true feelings to each other and kiss. Lori invites Jim to the wedding and end the movie as boyfriend and girlfriend.

Oriented around the city's Central Square, the district includes the city's major civic buildings, most of which are Classical Revival structures from the early 20th century, a number of commercial buildings dating as far back as the square's formation in the 1820s, and several late 19th-century industrial facilities. The district extends primarily along Main Street, from Bridge and Union Streets to Winter and Academy Streets, and includes properties extending along Wakefield and Hanson Streets, as well as other adjacent streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Rochester was chartered as a town in 1722, but substantive colonial settlement did not take place until conflicts with Native Americans subsided in the mid-18th century. The town was a center for lumber trade, and became a transportation hub, with the intersection of two stagecoach routes at what is now Central Square. In the 19th century it developed as a center of the textile and shoe industries, contributing to the state's nationwide prominence in the latter industry at the end of the century. Between 1797 and 1840 it was the county seat of Strafford County. The introduction of the railroad in 1849 continued the city's importance in transportation. The city's downtown is largely a product of late 19th and early 20th-century development, although there are surviving elements representative of its earlier importance. A few residences and commercial buildings dating to the 1820s are found on North Main Street, northwest of Central Square, interspersed with later 19th-century and modern infill. The Central Square area, the junction of North Main, South Main, and Wakefield Streets, is ringed with late 19th and early 20th-century commercial buildings, mostly of brick construction. Civic and religious buildings are also found along Main Street, including a courthouse, city hall, and churches. The city's 19th-century industrial heritage is remembered in the four-story factory building of E.W. Wallace, its major shoe manufacturer, at 100 South Main Street.

In 1997, Long was the original director of the early graphical multiplayer game Ultima Online, and from 2008‚Äì2013 he was executive producer at The Walt Disney Company, where he created and managed several educational games and apps for Club Penguin and the Disney Connected Learning platform. In early 2008, he was listed as one of the Top 20 Most Influential People in the MMO industry. In 2013, he again partnered with Garriott at Portalarium, where they began working on a new game Shroud of the Avatar. Career Long grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the only child of Zelda Klein Long (1948‚Äì2013) and Max \\"Cary\\" Long (1943‚Äì2003), who ran an antique store, Goudeau Antiques. He graduated in 1988 from Baton Rouge Magnet High School, and then attended Louisiana State University, earning a degree in Theatre in 1992. He did some part-time work building sets for local theaters such as Baton Rouge Opera, and then moved with some friends to Austin, Texas, where he continued at venues such as Live Oak Theatre. Because of the low pay in the theater business though, he began looking for other opportunities. On a whim, in September 1992 he responded to an ad looking for paid game testers, and to his surprise found himself suddenly hired by Richard Garriott's well-known game company Origin Systems (which shortly thereafter was acquired by Electronic Arts). At Origin, Long worked in Quality Assurance, documenting bugs on games such as Ultima VII, Wing Commander III, and ShadowCaster. He was soon promoted to QA Lead on games such as BioForge, then in 1995 to associate producer on Ultima IX, and to director of the first online version of the Ultima series, Ultima Online, where Long's online persona was known as Lord Blackthorn. The game was released in 1997, and though not the first graphical MMO, gained considerable attention as part of the popular Ultima series, attracting 250,000 players. It went on to win several awards, including being the first inductee to the GDC Online Awards Hall of Fame, and was listed by TIME magazine as one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In 2000, Long and the Garriott brothers left Origin (which was disbanded by its parent company Electronic Arts in 2004), and formed a new company, Destination Games. In 2001 it was acquired by Korea- based NCsoft, with the company's first game Tabula Rasa released in late 2007. However, the game did not perform as well as was hoped, both Garriott and Long left the company in 2008, and the game was shut down in February 2009. The two then parted ways for a time, with Garriott forming a new company, Portalarium, and Long moving his family to Los Angeles, where he was hired by The Walt Disney Company as an executive producer. During the next four years, Long oversaw the creation of several social games and mobile apps for Disney and its subdivision Disney Interactive, such as the Disney Connected Learning Platform, the Disney Parent App for Facebook, several educational mini-games and a mobile version for Club Penguin, and several educational games for iPhones and iPads. Educators collaborating on the projects included Stanford University's Roy Pea and professors from the University of Georgia such as John Olive and Linda Labbo. Some games created were original concepts such as Pufflescape, Jelly Bean Counter, and Bits & Bolts, while others leveraged existing Disney properties, such as Cinderella Shapes & Patterns, Toy Story Letters & Letter Sounds, Fairies Art Studio, Ariel Numbers and Counting, Cars Numbers and Counting, and Disney Fairies Fashion Boutique. For a time, Long also managed the Disney online worlds Toontown Online, Pirates of the Caribbean Online, and Pixie Hollow, which were all closed in late 2013. In 2013 Long left Disney, formed his own consulting company \\"Stellar Effect\\", and then re-joined Richard Garriott at Portalarium. As of 2014, they are collaborating on a new game, Shroud of the Avatar, intended to be a crowd- funded and crowd-sourced title. Via Kickstarter in April 2013, Portalarium raised $2 million through crowdfunding, and Long was announced as executive producer in July 2013. The game was released in March 2018.

On 24 April 1916, she left Malta but was ordered to return immediately to search for a submarine in the vicinity. On 27 April the German submarine U-73 laid 22 mines outside the Grand Harbour of Valletta. The battleship HMS Russell sank after hitting two of these mines. Nasturtium arrived in Malta on 27 April. The Rear Admiral of Patrols based at Fort Rinella ordered the sloop to search for mines and submarines. At 19:10 she ended up in the same minefield as the Russell and struck a mine which exploded 7 feet below the waterline on her starboard side close to the foremost funnel. Seven crew members were killed. Her boiler rooms began to flood and the tug Prompt was sent from Sliema to assist her. By 21:00, she had a heavy list and all the crew were evacuated, except for a few hands on the forecastle.

The hospital was founded in 1843, and has been at its current location since 1973. It is one of two hospitals in the city of Eindhoven, the other is M√°xima Medisch Centrum, and it is the biggest hospital in the larger Eindhoven region.  History  R.K. Binnenziekenhuis van O.L. Vrouwe van Barmhartigheid. (English: Roman Catholic Inner Hospital of our dear Lady of forgiveness), more commonly known as Binnenziekenhuis (English: Inner Hospital), was founded in 1843 by the saint Catharina parish, at the Jan van Lieshoutstraat in the inner city of Eindhoven. With new medical developments in the 20th century and growth of the population it became too small and had no way of expanding at its location. Therefore in July 1968 building started by contractor Meuwese, at the Michelangelolaan in Woensel. The design was made by Leo de Bever and his brother Loed. The hospital was relocated in 1973. Since it was no longer located in the inner city the board chose a new name, Catharina Ziekenhuis, named after the Catharina parish, that founded the hospital.  Healthcare  In 2013 Catharina Ziekenhuis had 696 beds, making it the largest hospital in the Eindhoven region. With 3600 employees, out of which 210 medical specialists, it provided care for 150.000 policlinical patients, and 27.000 overnight clinical patients. Since 2000 Catharina Ziekenhuis has been accredited four times to be up to international quality standards, valid until 2017, by Nederlands Instituut voor Accreditatie in de Zorg (English: Dutch institute for accreditation in Health Care), a member of the International Society for Quality in Health Care. Since 2010 Catharina Ziekenhuis is one of the founding fathers of Santeon, a cooperative association of 7 Dutch hospitals. Other members of Santeon are Canisius- Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis (Nijmegen), Martini Ziekenhuis (Groningen), Medisch Spectrum Twente (Enschede and Oldenzaal), Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (Amsterdam), Maasstad Ziekenhuis (Rotterdam) and Sint Antonius Ziekenhuis (Nieuwegein).  Media  In 2012 the hospital made the media when it fired the group of medical specialist that made up the dermatology department, which had organised healthcare, outside hospital time, using hospital equipment, without the hospital's knowledge. In 2014 the unions stated that there was a workfloor atmosphere of fear in the hospital, after a video got out of personnel, made by the hospital to show hygiene ethics to personnel. The bad atmosphere was later denied in a statement by the hospital, the board and medical staff.

The film stars Susan Sarandon, Gil Bellows, Ellen Burstyn, Topher Grace, Donald Sutherland, and Christopher Heyerdahl.  Plot  Inspector Hazel Micallef (Susan Sarandon) is a police officer in the small Ontario town of Fort Dundas. She is called to check in on elderly Delia Chandler and finds the woman nearly decapitated in her living room. Chandler's mouth is twisted as if she is screaming. The police encounter another gruesome murder where a man's stomach has been fed to some dogs. His face was also twisted into a scream. After a third murder, the police come to believe they are dealing with a serial killer. They discover that the mouths have been positioned to form the syllables of the word \\"L√≠bera\\". Micallef consults Father Price (Donald Sutherland), a priest in the nearby Catholic church who specializes in Latin. Price explains the various meanings and uses of \\"libera\\", including a \\"Resurrection Prayer\\", which supposedly holds the power to raise the dead. He claims that Jesus was resurrected through the sacrifice of 12 willing souls. Micallef deduces that the serial killer she is pursuing is contorting his victims' faces into the 12 syllables of the Resurrection Prayer. Micallef's deputy, Ben Wingate (Topher Grace), uses his mother's travel points to fly to British Columbia to follow a lead from the Delia Chandler killing. He finds a woman at a trailer in the middle of the forest and learns that she is delivering gifts from \\"the disciples\\" and begs him not to enter the trailer. Inside, Wingate discovers more packages and a body wrapped in formaldehyde- soaked bandages. At a local coffee shop, a mysterious man (Christopher Heyerdahl) enters and chats with the waitress (Kristin Booth). She tells him that her daughter (Ella Ballentine) has terrible seizures, and he offers to help. At her house, he brews the child some tea and appears to smother her. When Micallef later visits the waitress, she learns that the daughter nearly died from the tea she drank but that a recent MRI revealed she was symptom- free. The young girl revealed that the mysterious man's name is Simon. Micallef consults the Coroner's Reports on the local victims and realizes that they were all poisoned. She also discovers that they were all terminally ill. She deduces that Simon is gathering his victims from an on-line forum for terminal patients. She tracks down his next victim and sends Wingate to prevent the murder. Wingate is not in time; and Simon grabs him from behind, injecting Wingate with a powerful sedative. Simon next turns up in Fr. Price's church, where they talk briefly about Simon's mission. It becomes clear that Simon is attempting to resurrect the body in his trailer and that Fr. Price will be his next victim, because he, too, is terminally ill. Fr. Price is willing to be a sacrifice, but he begins to doubt that they are doing the right thing. Wingate and Micallef arrive too late to save Fr. Price. A nun informs Micallef that Simon's real name is Peter and that he and his brother were orphans under Fr. Price's care. One of them was adopted while the other was left in the orphanage. The dead body in the trailer is Peter's brother, who had committed suicide a year earlier. Micallef's superiors have deduced who Peter's next victim will be, and they have already secured him. Micallef resents being left off the team that will arrest Peter. She finishes off a bottle of whisky and goes home in a stupor. Peter is waiting for her there. He drugs her and takes her to a farmhouse where he brews her some of his tea. He explains his mission to her, but she remains confused about why he would want to resurrect his brother, who did not want to live. Peter gets her to admit that the true source of her pain is the loss of her baby, and she nearly agrees to be his 12th victim. As she is about to drink the poison, she decides against it. Peter kills himself instead. The film ends with the police raiding the trailer and finding the bed empty.  Cast   Production  The movie was filmed primarily in the community of Dundas in Hamilton, Ontario.  Reception  The Calling grossed over $3 million in the United States on cable, satellite, and video on demand platforms and was #3 on the Top 10 Indie And Theatrical Films of 2014 on Xfinity, Comcast Cable's on demand service. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 51% based on 43 reviews with an average score of 5.5/10. Metacritic assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on a weighted average of 11 reviews from mainstream critics. Los Angeles Times reviewer Gary Goldstein praised the film, calling it \\"an absorbing, solidly crafted procedural thriller\\" and noting positively on Stone's directing, Abramovitch's writing, and Sarandon's performance which Goldstein later awarded the Best Actress designation in Los Angeles Times' 4th Annual \\"Level The Playing Field\\" nominations during Oscar season. Pete Vonder Haar of The Village Voice wrote that \\"The Calling breathes new life into a moribund genre by touching oft-ignored themes and offering a bit of introspection to go along with the obligatory slashed throats and biblical portents.\\" In her three star review of the film, critic Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News noted \\"If there are any cable executives out there looking for the next great drama, they might want to check out The Calling.\\" Bruce DeMara of the Toronto Star wrote that the film had \\"a solid beginning\\" and complimented Stone on creating \\"an interesting ... Canadian mood\\", but criticized the overall plot as \\"outlandish and preposterous\\" and stated that the film loses its initial momentum \\"despite Sarandon‚Äôs reliably solid performance\\". Frank Scheck, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, also notes the lack of momentum and cites Stone's pacing as \\"[keeping] the atmosphere oppressively moody to the point of sluggish tedium,\\" but praises the performances of the actors, especially Heyerdahl's \\"real level of creepiness.\\" RogerEbert.com writer Brian Tallerico called the film \\"a depressingly bad movie\\" that \\"miraculously finds a way to waste the prodigious talents of Susan Sarandon, Ellen Burstyn, and Donald Sutherland\\", likening it to \\"the colorful elements of Fargo and Seven [blended] into a bland beige.\\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph called the film's plot predictable and noted that \\"the dread barely bobs above sea level\\". The Calling is rated R16 in New Zealand for graphic violence.

According to Declan Walsh Bol Network was under the auspices of the fake diploma mill Axact. The media group was supposed to incorporate television, digital media, cinema and theater as well as digital media, but when the parent company of Bol, Axact, was unmasked as a diploma mill selling fake degrees Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority revoked the licence that it had awarded BOL, and the network was not even able to start transmission. Pakistani journalist Kamran Khan was appointed as the editor in chief, but he quit after the Axact scandal surfaced and stated that his conscience did not let him be affiliated with such a network. Bol News has launched its live regular transmission on 25 December 2016. History = Initial Start = The BOL Network was started by Pakistani businessman, Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh in June 2013, and according to him, it was meant to create an independent media house to portray a soft image of Pakistan and several notable journalists joined the network at that time. Bol TV claims to be on the Centrist/Left of Centre of the political spectrum but with a strong pro- nationalist outlook. It claims to have offered insurance of up to Rs. 10 million to cable operators. In 2014, BOL Network advertised on more than 20,000 public transport vehicles in Pakistan. The company also announced a television set brand by the name of BG. = Media personnel = During the early phases of Bol, many prominent media personnel joined the network. These included Nabeel Zafar, Zeba Shehnaz and Haider Imam Rizvi who joined the entertainment channel. Kamran Khan, Mubasher Lucman, Jasmeen Manzoor and Iftikhar Ahmed were reportedly a part of the Bol News channel. However all of them resigned once the Axact scandal unmasked the company as a scam and a fraud. Locations and infrastructure The head office is located in Karachi and called Bolistan The network's regional headquarters in the provinces are in Lahore and Islamabad. BOL Network, also operated their own DSNG vans and when the parent company, Axact, was raided by FBR in connection with fake degrees and money laundering, Bol Network used its DSNG vans to create a barricade and prevent journalists from coming near the building. When the Axact scandal came to light reliable sources informed the Federal Board of Revenue that most of the equipment used by Bol network had been imported illegally. A notice was served to the CEO under Section 26 of the Customs Act 1969 and he was ordered to submit proof that the equipment being used had been imported using legal means. Programming * Controversies = Axact Scandal =  Initial raids and indictments  On , The New York Times published an investigative story reporting that Axact ran at least 370 degree and accreditation mill websites. When Axact offices were raided by the FIA at the interior minister's orders, many compromising documents were recovered, including fake letterhead of the US State Department. Subsequently, Axact was sealed on May 28, 2015 and the Information ministry requested PEMRA to close down BOL. On May 26, 2015, Federal Investigation Agency arrested Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh for investigation. The case was filed against him on May 27, 2015 in Karachi, Pakistan. The same day he was ordered to submit \\"copy of the letter of credit, contract or proof of payment in support of the transactions and the source of financing for the procurement of the imported goods\\" as the FBR had received intelligence that Bol was using illegal equipment. on 5 June 2015, Ayesha Sheikh, the wife of Bol CEO Shoib Sheikh was indicted on charges of money laundering in connected with Axact and Bol.  Resignation of media personnel  Bol was aggressive in recruiting media personnel when the network was in development. However, when it came to light that the network was being run through illegal means and was part of a scam they were quick to leave. While Kamran Khan tweeted that his conscience would not let him continue, Iftikhar Ahmad wrote ‚Äúcannot work for an organisation whose basic workings conflict with my professional commitment.‚Äù Asma Shirazi resigned and posted on Twitter, ‚ÄúI have resigned from Bol News. Truth must prevail.‚Äù  Post Axact Scandal Acquisition  After the suspension of the BOL Network and BOL News there was a mass exodus of journalists and other media personnel from the company. However ARY Digital Network CEO Salman Iqbal offered to take over the beleaguered company in August 2015. He stated that the decision had been taken in view to provide career protection to media industry and its workers. The founder of ARY Group said that his media group would launch the transmission of the channel within three weeks. On September 30, 2015, it was announced that the deal between the owners of BOL and ARY Digital Network had fallen through.  Denial of access to Axact databases and offices  Both Bol and Axact have been petitioning to be granted access to databases maintained by Axact. However FIA declined to allow them access. On 12 April 2016 the Supreme court of Pakistan rejected the plea entered by Bol and Axact administration which requested that they be granted access to their databases and offices.

History This Canal initiated as part of Sriram Sagar stage-II in which the foundation stone was laid by the former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in 1991. With this Canal the surplus water from Sriram Sagar Project can be taken into Mid Manair Dam to utilize another 25 tmcft and also it can be used to fill the Lower Manair Dam at Karimnagar City. Canal construction was completed by July 2010, It was open in Aug 2010 after couple of trials. Canal is currently using to fill Lower Manair Dam as Mid Manair is under construction. It has been designed in such way that it will discharge 22000 cusecs water (Max Capacity), which means it can carry 50 tmcft water into Mid Manair (26 tmcft) and Lower Manair (24 tmcft) reservoirs in just 25 days at its full canal capacity (i.e. 2 tmcft per day). Canal remodelling The canal's full supply level (FSL) is MSL with MSL full reservoir level of Sriram Sagar reservoir. So the flood canal can be used only if the water level is above 1070 feet. The flood canal is not in use in most of the years as the water inflows in to the Sriram Sagar reservoir is not adequate to build up the level to 1070 ft. As an alternative, Yellampalli Lift Canal from Yellampalli Project is under construction with which water will be lifted into Flood Flow Canal at Gangadhara to feed Mid Manair Dam. In fact, by re-engineering of this defunct canal to reverse its flow direction by raising its bank levels and installing low head high flow concrete volute pumps at existing major aqueducts, at balancing reservoirs & at Sriram Sagar reservoir inlet point, Godavari flood waters during monsoon months from the Pranahita Chevella lift can be stored in the 110 tmcft gross storage capacity of Sriram Sagar reservoir for use during the dry months. The stored water can be released back into Kakatiya Canal by gravity from the Sriram Sagar reservoir for use in the command area of SRSP as well as Pranahita Chevella projects when adequate water is not available in the lower Godavari basin during dry seasons. Also remodelled SRSP flood canal can be used for supplying water by gravity for irrigating nearly 300,000 acres on its both sides by the water supplied from the Pranahita Chevella project. To facilitate this remodelling in future, the single lift (96 MWC) envisaged from Myadaram tank to the SRSP flood flow canal should be split into two lifts (76 + 20 MWC) via Kakatiya canal. The re-engineering of this canal is similar to modifications carried out to reverse the water flow of ancient Grand canal under Eastern Route project of South to North Water Transfer in China.

Legal framework PICES is an international intergovernmental organization established under a Convention for a North Pacific Marine Science Organization.PICES Convention (1991) The Convention entered into force on 1992-03-24 with an initial membership that included the governments of Canada, Japan, and the United States of America. The Convention was ratified by the People's Republic of China on 1992-08-31 to increase membership to four countries. Although the Soviet Union had participated in the development of the Convention, it was not ratified there until 1994-12-16, by the Russian Federation. The Republic of Korea acceded to the Convention on 1995-7-30. The Republic of Mexico and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are located within the Convention Area (generally north of 30¬∞N) but are not members. Oversight A Governing Council consisting of up to two delegates appointed by each member country is the primary decision-making body.PICES Convention Day-to-day operations of the organization are managed by the staff of the PICES Secretariat, located in Canada at the Institute of Ocean Sciences (located on Patricia Bay in British Columbia). History The idea to create a Pacific version of ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea)ICES, http://www.ices.dk was first discussed by scientists from Canada, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States who were attending a conference, sponsored by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in February 1973.Tjossem 2005, p. 18. ICES had provided a forum since 1902 for scientists bordering the Atlantic Ocean and its marginal seas to exchange information, conduct joint research, publish their results, and provide scientific advice about fisheries, primarily in the North Atlantic.ICES Convention (1964) In recognition of its Atlantic heritage, the nickname PICES (Pacific ICES) was adopted for the North Pacific Marine Science Organization. Informal meetings of proponents occurred sporadically through the 1980s, eventually entraining government officials into the discussion in the mid-1980s.Tjossem 2005 The final text of a convention for a new marine science organization was endorsed in Ottawa, Canada on 1990-12-12. A scientific planning meeting was held in Seattle, USA in December 1991 to prepare for decisions made at the first annual meeting in October 1992 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.1992 PICES Annual Report Mandate The primary mandate of the organization is to promote and to coordinate marine scientific research in the North Pacific Ocean and to provide a mechanism for information and data exchange among scientists in its member country. This has been achieved through various means, but primarily by establishing major integrative scientific programs such as the PICES/GLOBEC Scientific Program on Carrying Capacity and Climate Change. The alignment of PICES with a global research program (GLOBEC) in the mid 1990s was fundamental to building the reputation of the organization in the international scientific community. Research on climate and marine ecosystem variability, global warming, ocean acidification and related topics was about to explode in the 1990s, and PICES was strategically in a position to take a significant role in exploring how oceans, atmospheres, and their biota were affected by the changes. A fundamental difference between PICES and ICES was a much lower priority on developing assessments of fisheries and fish stocks. International borders are much farther apart in the North Pacific compared to the northeastern Atlantic, so coastal fisheries that might compete are separated by large distances involving fewer countries. As a result, transboundary and straddling stock issues generally tend to be managed bilaterally, rather than multilaterally in the North Pacific. Research on fish stocks in PICES has generally been directed toward environmental influences on species. This has produced a naturally synergy with ICES as the expertise on different topics of fisheries science has developed. Committees Since its creation, the primary scientific directions of the organization have stemmed from its scientific committees (biological oceanography, fishery science, physical oceanography and climate, and marine environmental quality) supported by two technical committees (data exchange and monitoring). Each committee has authority to create subsidiary expert groups, with the approval of the Governing Council, to undertake the scientific work of the committees. National membership of all committees and other expert groups is determined by the delegates of each member country. Committee chairmen serve on the PICES Science Board, which is responsible for authorizing and overseeing all scientific activities of the organization. Scientific programs To facilitate cooperative research on important topics by marine scientists in member countries, PICES established two major integrative scientific programs during its first two decades. From 1995 to 2006, the PICES/GLOBEC regional programme on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity sought to improve understanding of climate variation in the North Pacific, its effect on marine ecosystems, and the productive capacity of the ocean.Batchelder and Kim 2008 An important outcome of the work was learning that decadal-scale variation is dominant in the North Pacific, to the point where long-term changes are difficult to detect Bindoff et al. 2007, Section 5.3.3 The second program on Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE) began in October 2009. Its primary goals are to understand how marine ecosystems in the North Pacific respond to climate change and human activities, to provide forecasts of ecosystem status, and to communicate the results of the program broadly.FUTURE 2009 Special projects From time to time, member countries have asked PICES to undertake scientific studies on a particular topic of special interest to them. These differ from the regular work of the expert groups because incremental funding is typically provided to the organization to conduct the work. Recent examples, funding sources, and links to their products are listed here: * climate regime shifts (U.S.A.)King 2005 * harmful algal blooms (Japan) * invasive marine species (Japan)Kestrup, √Ösa M. 2014 * survival of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Canada)McKinnell et al. 2012 * human dimension of marine ecosystem variability (Japan) * tsunami debris (Japan) Ecosystem status reporting Recognizing the need to understand and to communicate information on variability in marine ecosystems among member countries, PICES initiated a pilot project in 2002 that would result in the publication of its first ecosystem status report.PICES 2004 Thereafter, ocean climate and marine ecosystem reporting was seen as an important function of the organization so it continued with an extensive update.McKinnell and Dagg 2010 This version placed greater emphasis on basin-scale comparisons, the primary scale of interest of the organization, but the cost and effort that was required to create such a document led to simplifications. Future versions will feature greater use of automation and technology, with printed versions appearing less frequently. Global collaboration During its first decade, PICES became a major international forum for exchanging results and discussing climatic- oceanic-biotic research in the North Pacific. Awareness of the benefits of working cooperatively on scientific problems led to increasing collaboration with like-minded organizations in the North Pacific. The first occasion where PICES had a leadership role was the Beyond El Ni√±o Conference (La Jolla, USA ‚Äì 2000). The results of the conference appeared in the largest special issue of Progress in Oceanography ever published McKinnell, S.M. et al. In the years that followed, PICES partnered with ICES, IOC, SCOR, and others to build its scientific and organizational reputations. Capacity building Capacity building is a high priority activity in PICES and in many other organizations. Initially, PICES focused on the need to develop capacity in those member countries with developing economies, or economies in transition. The primary goals are now focused on developing young scientific talents in all member countries . This is achieved through an intern program at the Secretariat, early career scientist conferences, summer schools, travel grants to allow participation in the PICES Annual Meeting, sponsoring speakers at international conferences, and awards and recognition of deserving early career scientists.

Horses play a large role in the daily and national life of the Mongols; it is traditionally said that \\"A Mongol without a horse is like a bird without the wings.\\" , who travelled through Mongolia in 1911, observed, \\"To appreciate the Mongol you must see him on horseback,‚Äîand indeed you rarely see him otherwise, for he does not put foot to ground if he can help it. The Mongol without his pony is only half a Mongol, but with his pony he is as good as two men. It is a fine sight to see him tearing over the plain, loose bridle, easy seat, much like the Western cowboy, but with less sprawl.\\" (see also A Wayfarer in China). Mongolia holds more than 3 million horses, an equine population which outnumbers the country's human population. The horses live outdoors all year at in summer down to in winter, and search for food on their own. The mare's milk is processed into the national beverage airag, and some animals are slaughtered for meat. Other than that, they serve as riding animals, both for the daily work of the nomads and in horse racing. Mongol horses were a key factor during the 13th century conquest of the Mongol Empire. Of the five kinds of herd animals typically recognized in Mongolia (horses, camels, oxen/yaks, sheep and goats), horses are seen to have the highest prestige.Cleaves. The Secret History of the Mongols, p. 126 A nomad with many horses is considered wealthy. Mongol people individually have favorite horses. Each family member has his or her own horse, and some family members favor their preferred horses by letting them out of hard jobs. Horses are generally considered the province of men, although women also have extensive knowledge of horsemanship. Men do the herding, racing and make the tack. Traditionally, men (or in modern times, women) also milk the mares. Care and Grooming The mane of the horse at right has been trimmed save for a patch near the withers. The horse at left is being used for racing in the annual Naadam festival, and its forelock has been put up into a topknot. Compared to Western methods, Mongolians take a very \\"hands off\\" approach to horse care. Horses are not bathed or fed special foods like grain or hay. Rather, they are simply allowed to graze freely on the steppe, digging through the snow to find forage in the winter. Because nature provides so well for the Mongol horse, they cost little to nothing to raise. As such, horses are not an expensive luxury item as in Western culture, but a practical necessity of everyday life. Herdsmen regard their horses as both a form of wealth and a source of the daily necessities: transportation, food and drink. Mongol riders have individual favorite horses. Each family member has his or her own horse, which may receive special treatment. In Mongolia, barns, pastures and stables are the exception, not the rule. Horses are generally allowed to roam free; if they are needed, they may be tied up temporarily. The hitching post used for this purpose differs from the usual Western conception of a bar placed across two posts. Such creations are wood intensive, and on the steppe trees are rare. Instead, the horses may be tied to a single wooden pole or a large boulder. Because the horses are allowed to live much the same as wild horses, they require little in the way of hoof care. The hooves are left untrimmed and unshod and farriers are basically nonexistent. Despite the lack of attention, Mongol horses have hard, strong hooves and seldom experience foot problems. During the summer, Mongolian horses will often stand in a river, if available, in order to keep insects off.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe. Mongolians say that fat horses have \\"grass in their belly\\" while lean horses have \\"water in their belly.\\" Herdsman prefer to make long journeys during seasons when horses are well fed so as to spare tired or thin animals from exertion. Particularly in the spring, horses are vulnerable to exhaustion: \\"By the end of winter, the animals are a dreadful sight. ‚Ä¶ The horses are too frail to be ridden and some can barely walk. ‚Ä¶ When the new grass appears, however, native Mongolian breeds of animals tend to recover very quickly.\\"Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 53. Horses, along with sheep and goats, have a better chance of surviving difficult winter conditions than cattle and sheep because they are able to separate snow from grass with their dextrous lips. When a zud hits, the typical pattern is for cattle to die first, then sheep, horses, and lastly goats. Thus, horses are the second most winter-resilient animals raised by Mongolians.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 57. Mares begin foaling in May and continue throughout the summer. Sick or cold foals will sometimes be taken into the ger, wrapped in skins or felts, and placed next to fire. A typical Mongolian herd consists of 15 - 50 mares and geldings under one stallion. Some stallions are allowed to manage herds of up to 70 animals, though these are considered exceptional individuals. The stallion is tasked with leading the herd, siring foals, and defending the herd against wolves. The herd stallion, rather than the human owner, is entrusted with the day to day management of the herd. Elizabeth Kendall observed in 1911 that, \\"Each drove of horses is in the charge of a stallion which looks sharply after the mares, fighting savagely with any other stallion which attempts to join the herd. I am told that the owner only needs to count his stallions to be sure that all the mares have come home.\\" (see also A Wayfarer in China) Since the mares are used for foals and milking, they are not often used for work; this is the job of the geldings. Geldings rather than stallions are the preferred work animals. Members of the Darkhad ethnic group ride their stallions only once a year, on three special days during the winter. There are special horses within each herd used for roping, racing, beauty, or distance riding. A herdsman may own one or several herds of horses, each headed by its own stallion. A newly wedded couple will be given a gift of horses by the parents on both the husband and wife's sides. Each family will give the couple 10 - 15 horses apiece and two stallions so that they can start up their own herd. The extra stallion is sold or traded away. Mane trimming varies by region. Stallions are always left untrimmed; a long, thick mane is considered a sign of strength. Geldings, however, are clipped. Among the Darkhad ethnic group, the forelock is cut short and the bridle path is left unclipped. Sometimes the mane of a horse will be clipped short except for one patch near the withers. Mongolians save the cut off mane of the horse for spiritual reasons. Both tail and mane hair can also be made into various spiritual and utilitarian products, i.e. spirit banners or rope. Manes are always left long in the winter to keep the horse warm. The sole grooming tool used is a brush. The tail is generally left unclipped. When a horse is gelded in the spring, the very tip of the tail may be cut off. Branding may or may not be done; if it is, it is done in the fall. During races, the forelock is put in a topknot that stands up from the horse's head. The hairy part of the tail may also have a tie placed around it midway down. For race horses, the owner will also have a wooden sweat scraper to clean off the horse after a race. After the Naadam, spectators will come up to touch the winning horses' mane and sweat as both a sign of respect and a way to imbibe good fortune. The winning horse is also sprinkled with airag.Davis, Matthew. When Things Get Dark: A Mongolian Winter's Tale, p. 168. Gelding is done when a colt is 2 ‚Äì 3 years old. The date chosen for the event may be set by a lama so as to ensure good fortune. The colts to be castrated are caught and their legs are tied. The animals are then pushed on their side. The horse's topmost hindleg is tied to its neck, exposing its testicles. The genitals are washed, then cut off with a knife that has been cleaned in boiling water. Afterwards, the wound is rinsed with mare's milk, a practice intended to encourage healing. An observer reported, \\"The animal does not appear to experience much pain during the operation, but tends to be in a state of confusion when let loose on the steppe.\\"Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 55. An entire family will typically join in the castration process; depending on the number of colts to be castrated, several households may participate so that the castration may be completed in one day. When the work of castration is completed, the testicles are used for ritual purposes. One of the amputated testicles is punctured with a knife so as to permit the insertion of a rope; the rope is then fastened to the new gelding's tail with the assumption that once the testicle has dried, the wound will have finished healing. The remaining testicle is cooked in the hearth ashes and eaten by the head of the household to acquire the strength of the stallion.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 56. The nomadic Mongols rides on the horse and hold lassos of horses in hand. Riding and Training Mongolian nomads have long been considered to be some of the best horsemen in the world. During the time of Genghis Khan, Mongol horse archers were capable of feats such as sliding down the side of their horse to shield their body from enemy arrows, while simultaneously holding their bow under the horse's chin and returning fire, all at full gallop. In 1934, Haslund described how a herdsman breaking in a semi-wild horse was able to ungirth and unsaddle his horse as it bucked underneath him. He wrote, \\"It is a pleasure to see the Mongols in association with their horses, and to see them on horseback is a joy. ...[T]he strength, swiftness and elegance of a Mongol surpass that of any ballet dancer.\\"Haslund, Henning. In Secret Mongolia, p. 111. This same skill in horsemanship held true in antiquity. Giovanni de Carpini, a Franciscan friar who visited Mongolia during the 1240s, observed that \\"their children begin as soon as they are two or three years old to ride and manage horses and to gallop on them, and they are given bows to suit their stature and are taught to shoot; they are extremely agile and also intrepid. Young girls and women ride and gallop on horseback with agility like men.\\"Carpini, quoted in Dawson, C. A Mission to Asia, p. 18. Today as in the Middle Ages, the education of a modern Mongolian horseman begins in childhood. Parents will place their child on a horse and hold them there before the child can even hang on without assistance. By the age of 4, children are riding horses with their parents.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 104. By age 6, children can ride in races; by age 10, they are learning to make their own tack. Carpini noted that the Mongols did not use spurs (these were unknown in Central Asia at that time); they did, however use a short whip. This whip had a leather loop at the end; when the rider was not using it, he would let it hang from his wrist so that he could have his hands free to perform tasks, e.g. archery. It was taboo to use the whip as a prop or to touch an arrow to the whip; such crimes were punishable by death. It was also punishable by death to strike a horse with a bridle.Hoang, Michel. Genghis Khan. New Amsterdam Books, 1991. Haslund noted that as of 1934, it was considered a crime to strike a horse with a whip in areas in front of the stirrup.Haslund, Henning. In Secret Mongolia, p. 112. Mongolian cultural norms encourage the humane treatment of horses. After spending years in the country, Haslund could not recall even one instance of seeing a horse mistreated. Indeed, he found that Mongols who had been to China and observed their use of horses typically came back \\"filled with righteous wrath and indignation over the heavy loads and cruel treatment that human beings there deal out to their animals.\\"Haslund, Henning. In Secret Mongolia, p. 113. In Genghis Khan's time, there were strict rules dictating the way horses were to be used on campaign. The Khan instructed his general Subutai, \\"See to it that your men keep their crupper hanging loose on their mounts and the bit of their bridle out of the mouth, except when you allow them to hunt. That way they won't be able to gallop off at their whim [tiring out the horses unnecessarily]. Having established these rules--see to it you seize and beat any man who breaks them. ... Any man...who ignores this decree, cut off his head where he stands.\\"Khan, Paul. Secret History of the Mongols: The Origin of Genghis Khan, p. 108. Mongolian tack differs from Western tack in being made almost completely of raw hide and using knots instead of metal connectors. Tack design follows a \\"one size fits all\\" approach, with saddles, halters and bits all produced in a single size. Mongolian tack is very light compared to western tack; hobbles in particular are about half the weight of their Western counterparts. The Mongol pack saddle can be adjusted to fit yaks and bactrian camels. The modern Mongolian riding saddle is very tall, with a wooden frame and several decorated metal disks that stand out from the sides. It has a high pommel and cantle, and is placed upon a felt saddlecloth to protect the horse's back. The horse's thick coat also provides a barrier that helps prevent saddle sores. In the Middle Ages, the Mongols used a different style of saddle, the chief difference being that the cantle flattened out in the rear rather than rising to a peak like the cantle of a modern Mongolian saddle. This allowed the rider greater freedom of movement; with a minimal saddle, a mounted archer could more readily swivel his torso to shoot arrows towards the rear. The Mongolian saddle, showing short stirrups, high pommel and cantle, and distinctive metal discs.The Mongolian saddle, both medieval and modern, has short stirrups rather like those used by modern race horses. The design of the stirrups makes it possible for the rider to control the horse with his legs, leaving his hands free for tasks like archery or holding a catch-pole. Riders will frequently stand in the stirrups while riding. The design of the Mongolian saddle allows only marginal control of the gait. In most situations, the horse will decide the gait on its own, while the rider is occupied with other tasks such as herding cattle. Very often, a Mongol horse will choose to canter. The occasional Mongol horse will have an ambling gait, which is to say that it will lift both its left hooves at one time, then both its right hooves at one time, etc. Such horses are called joroo, and is said that they \\"glide as if though on ice, so smoothly that one can trot along on one holding a full cup and not spill any of the contents.\\" The Mongols, who ride hundreds of miles on horseback across the roadless steppe, place a very high value on horses with a smooth gait. Mongolian horsemen are required to learn everything necessary to care for a horse. This is because they do not typically employ outside experts such as trainers, farriers or veterinarians and must do everything themselves. For particularly difficult problems, the local elders may be called in or even an outside vet if one can be found. Materials such as books on horse training or medical care are uncommon and seldom used. Informally knowledge is passed down orally from parent to child. Though Mongolian horses are small, they are used to carry quite large, heavy riders. This ability is due in part to the riders' habit of frequently switching off horses so as not to overtax any particular animal. However, Mongol horses are also very strong. A Darkhad horse weighing only 250 kg. can carry a load of 300 kg‚Äîthe equivalent of carrying another horse on its back. When pulling a cart, a team of four Mongol horses can draw a load of 4400 lbs for 50‚Äì60 km a day.Cheng. P. (1984) Livestock breeds of China. Animal Production and Health Paper 46 (E, F, S). Publ. by FAO, Rome, 217 pp. Horses are usually not ridden until they are three years old; a two-year-old horse may be broken with a particularly light rider so as to avoid back problems. The breaking process is quite simple: the rider simply gets on and lets the horse run until it is exhausted. Then the horse is taught to respond to the pull of the reins. In Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province, the horses may be worked in round pens. This practice is not common in the rest of Mongolia however; wood is too scarce to be wasted on fencing. Since individual horses are ridden relatively infrequently, they become nearly wild and must be caught and broken anew each time they are used. A herdsman must first catch the horse he wants; to do this, he mounts a special catch-horse which has been trained for the purpose. Carrying an urga, a lasso attached to a long pole, he chases after the horse he wants and loops the urga around its neck. The catch- horse helps the herdsmen pull back on the looped horse until it grows tired and stops running. At this point another rider will come up and put a saddle on it and mount. The horse will run and buck until it recalls its earlier training and allows itself to be ridden. The catching part may take up to several hours, depending on the terrain, the catcher's skill, and the equipment used. As warhorses Mongol warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot. Mongol horses are best known for their role as the war steeds of Genghis Khan, who is reputed to have said: \\"It is easy to conquer the world from the back of a horse.\\" The Mongol soldier relied on his horses to provide him with food, drink, transportation, armor, shoes, ornamentation, bowstring, rope, fire, sport, music, hunting, entertainment, spiritual power, and in case of his death, a mount to ride in the afterlife. The Khan's army, weapons, war tack and military tactics were built around the idea of mounted cavalry archers, and to a lesser extent light and heavy cavalry. In the Secret History of the Mongols, Genghis Khan is recorded as urging his general Subutai to pursue his enemies as though they were wild horses with a catch-pole loop around their neck.Cleaves. The Secret History of the Mongols, p. 133. Captured enemy rulers were sometimes trampled to death by horses. As a war vehicle, the Mongol horse compared favorably with other breeds in use at the time. Mongol horses needed little water and did not need to be fed daily rations of grain, as many European breeds did. Their ability to forage beneath the snow and find their own fodder allowed the Mongols freedom to operate without long supply trains, a factor which was key to their military success. Mongol horses were bred to survive in harsh conditions, making it possible for the Mongols to mount successful winter campaigns against Russia. The excellent long distance endurance of the Mongol horse allowed warriors to outlast enemy cavalry during battle; the same endurance granted the Mongols a communications advantage across their widely spread out fronts, since messages had to be conveyed by horse. The main disadvantage of the Mongol horse as a war steed was that it was slower than some of the other breeds it faced on the battlefield. However, this drawback was compensated for by the fact that it was typically required to carry less weight than other cavalry horses. Although the Mongol horse is almost a pony, it acquired a fearsome reputation among the Mongols' enemies. Matthew Paris, an English writer in the 1200s, described the small steeds as, \\"big, strong horses, which eat branches and even trees, and which they [the Mongols] have to mount by the help of three steps on account of the shortness of their thighs.\\" (Though short, the Mongols did not actually use steps to mount.) It is said that a Mongol warrior's horse would come at his whistle and follow him around, doglike. Each warrior would bring a small herd of horses with him (3 - 5 being average, but up to 20) as remounts. They would alternate horses so that they always rode a fresh horse.http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/e/2/a/e2a1d0358bc915f8/dchha43_Wrath_of_the_Khans_I.mp3?c_id=4619666&expiration;=1407651729&hwt;=420e072218ce055f8949bfc72e019661 Giovanni de Carpini noted that after a Mongol warrior had ridden a particular horse, the man would not ride it again for three or four days. Matthew Paris' imaginative depiction of a Mongol horse eating trees while its riders enjoy a cannibal feast. The Mongols did not make a practice of eating their conquered enemies.Soldiers preferred to ride lactating mares because they could use them as milk animals. In times of desperation, they would also slit a minor vein in their horse's neck and drain some blood into a cup. This they would drink either \\"plain\\" or mixed with milk or water. This habit of blood-drinking (which applied to camels as well as horses) shocked the Mongols' enemies. Matthew Paris, an English writer in the 1200s, wrote scornfully, \\"...they [the Mongols] have misused their captives as they have their mares. For they are inhuman and beastly, rather monsters than men, thirsting for and drinking blood...\\" The Mongol armies did not have long supply trains; instead, they and their horses lived off the land and the people who dwelt there. Ibn al-Athir observed, \\"Moreover they [the Mongols] need no commissariat, nor the conveyance of supplies, for they have with them sheep, cows, horses, and the like quadrupeds, the flesh of which they eat, naught else. As for their beasts which they ride, these dig into the earth with their hoofs and eat the roots of plants, knowing naught of barley. And so, when they alight anywhere, they have need of nothing from without.\\" It was important for the Mongols to find good grazing for their herds of remounts, or failing that, to capture enemy foodstuff. During the conquest of the city of Bukhara, Genghis Khan's cry, \\"Feed the horses!\\" indicated that soldiers were to pillage and slaughter the inhabitants. Genghis Khan warned Subutai to be careful to conserve his horses' strength on long campaigns, warning that it would do no good to spare them after they were already used up. Mongolian horses have long been used for hunting, which was viewed as both a sport, a means of livelihood, and as training for military ventures. Animals like gazelles were taken with bow and arrow from the backs of horses, while other game was rounded up by mounted riders. To the Mongols, the tactics used in hunting game from horseback were little different from those used in hunting enemy cavalry on horseback. Armies would also hunt for food while on the march, an activity which could wear out the horses. Genghis Khan, concerned that his soldiers would use up the strength of their horses before reaching the battlefield, instructed general Subutai that he should set limits on the amount of hunting his men did.Cleaves. The Secret History of the Mongols, p. 134. As of 1911, horsemen still hunted wolves from horseback. Elizabeth Kendall observed, \\"These Mongolian wolves are big and savage, often attacking the herds, and one alone will pull down a good horse or steer. The people wage more or less unsuccessful war upon them and at times they organize a sort of battue. Men, armed with lassoes, are stationed at strategic points, while others, routing the wolves from their lair, drive them within reach.\\" (see also A Wayfarer in China). The Mongols used many tools meant specifically to attack mounted riders. The spear used by warriors had a hook at the end which was used for dehorsing opponents and snagging the legs of enemies' horses. They also used whistling arrows to frighten opposing horses. Mongols had no qualms about shooting the mounts out from under other cavalrymen; there was even a particular type of arrow especially designed for the purpose. For this reason, horses of well-to-do individuals were armored with iron or hardened leather plates called lamellae. The armor was a full body covering with five distinct pieces that shielded the head, neck, body and hindquarters. The Mongols preferred to use a whip to urge their horses on during battle, while their European opponents preferred spurs. The whip provided them with a tactical advantage because it was more safe and effective than spurs: a whip can be felt through armor and does not harm the horse, whereas spurs cannot be felt through armor and injure the horse. When the Mongols wished to conceal their movements or make themselves appear more numerous, they would sometimes tie a tree branch to their horse's tail to raise dust, obscuring their position and creating the illusion of a larger group of horsemen.http://www.amphi.com/media/4226193/genghis%20khan%20-weatherford%20selections.pdf A story goes that Jebe shot the horse out from under Genghis Khan during a battle. The animal in question had had a white-speckled muzzle. When Jebe was captured later, he admitted flat out to the Khan's face that he had fired the arrow in question. Genghis Khan admired the man's courage, and instead of killing Jebe, he took him into his own army. Many years later, when Jebe had become a general, Genghis Khan became concerned that his subordinate had ambitions to replace him. To allay the Khan's suspicions, Jebe sent him a gift of 1,000 horses with white speckled muzzles. Horses were used to guide the Mongols' makeshift boats across rivers. Pian de Carpine described the procedure as follows: \\"When they come to a river, they cross it in the following way, even if it is a large one: the chiefs have a round, light skin, around the top of which they have loopholes very close together through which they pass a cord, and they stretch it so that it bellies out, and this they fill with clothes and other things, and then they bind it down very tightly. After that they put their saddles and other hard things on it, and the men likewise sit on it. Then they tie the boat thus made to the tail of a horse, and a man swims along ahead leading it; or they sometimes have two oars, and with them they row across the water, thus crossing the river. Some of the poorer people have a leather pouch, well sewn, each man having one; and in this pouch or sack they put their clothing and all their things, and they tie the mouth of the bag tightly, and tie it to the tail of a horse, then they cross as stated above.\\" The Mongols covered continental distances on horseback. In particular, general Subutai's European army was fighting a full 5,000 km distant from their homeland in Mongolia. Since his forces did not travel on a direct beeline but made various diversions en route, the 5,000 kilometers actually translates to a horseback ride that has been estimated at 8,000 km in total length.Hoang, Michel. Genghis Khan, p. 258. Messages were carried rapidly throughout the Mongol empire by a pony-express style relay system in which riders would pass messages from station to station, switching to a fresh horse each time. A similar system of horse-expedited mail was still practiced in Mongolia as of 1911. Elizabeth Kendall described it as follows: \\"Under the treaties of 1858 and 1860 a post-route between the Russian frontier and Kalgan was established, and in spite of the competing railway through Manchuria, a horse-post still crosses the desert three times a month each way. The Mongols who are employed for the work go through from city to city in seven days, galloping all the way, with frequent changes of horses and, less frequent, of men.\\" Spiritual beliefs It is believed that the spirit of a stallion resides within his mane; thus, a long, thick mane is considered a mark of a strong animal. The mane of a stallion is never cut, though the manes of geldings are. After a stallion dies, the owner may save the mane. The first foal of the year will also have a blue scarf tied around its neck; this foal is believed to represent the strength of the year's crop of foals. When a Mongol rider passes an ovoo, they may offer some of their horse's tail hairs before proceeding. A family may have a sacred horse among their herd, which is signified by a blue scarf tied around the neck. The horse is generally never ridden, though on rare occasions the head of the household may do so. Historically, horses were sacrificed on special occasions; it is recorded that 40 horses were sacrificed at the funeral of Genghis Khan. When a Mongol warrior died, his horse would be killed and buried with him. In 1253, William of Rubruk observed the scene of a recent funeral where the skins of sixteen horses had been hung up on long poles, with four skins pointing towards each corner of the compass. There was also kumis (mare's milk) for the deceased to drink. Mare's milk was used in a variety of religious ceremonies. In \\"The Secret History of the Mongols,\\" it is recorded that Genghis Khan sprinkled mare's milk on the ground as a way to honor a mountain for protecting him. Before battle, the Mongols would sprinkle mare's milk on the ground to ensure victory. Sprinkled milk was also used for purification; envoys to the Khan were required to pass between two fires while being sprinkled with mare's milk to cleanse them of evil devices and witchcraft. William of Rubruck noted in 1253 that, \\"If he [a Mongol master of the house] were to drink [liquor while] seated on a horse, he first before he drinks pours a little on the neck or the mane of the horse.\\" In modern times, Mongol horses may be blessed with a sprinkling of mare's milk before a race. After the national Naadam races, the winning horses are sprinkled with mare's milk, and the top five horses in each racing category are named the \\"airag's five.\\" After a Naadam wrestling match, the winner will take a sip of airag and toss some into the air. Milk may also be sprinkled after people who are leaving on a journey.Davis, Matthew. When Things Get Dark: A Mongolian Winter's Tale, p. 18. When a favorite horse dies, the owner may dispose of the remains in several ways. To show respect, they may take the horse's skull and place it on an oovo, a pile of rocks used in the shamanic religion. Others believe that when a horse is killed for food, its skull should be left in the field because of the sanctity of the horse. It is considered disrespectful for a horse's skull or hooves to be stepped upon; for this reason, such remains may be hung from a tree. Horses are believed to have spirits that can help or hurt their owner after death. When a deceased horse's spirit is content, the owner's herd will flourish; if not, then the herd will fail. Horses in Myth, Song and Folklore =Mythology= According to shamanic tradition, a person's soul is called a wind horse (—Ö–∏–π–º–æ—Ä—å, Khiimori). The wind horse is depicted on the official Mongolian coat of arms, which features a winged horse. Among the shamanistic tngri, the 99 highest divinities of Tengerism, there is an equestrian deity called KisaŒ≥a Tngri who protects souls (and also riches). Another divinity, AtaŒ≥a Tngri, is a protector of horses themselves.Heissig 1980, p. 53-54 The drum used by shamans was often made of horse skin, the drum itself standing for \\"the saddle animal on which the shaman rides or the mount that carries the invoked spirit to the shaman.\\" In the Gesar epic, the demons ride unnatural horses that have no tails. =Folklore and Song= Like many cultures, the Mongols have tales of magical horses. In one story, a Mongolian Robin Hood figure stole livestock from the rich and gave them to the poor. One day he was being pursued by lawmen on horseback, and he came to a river his horse could not cross. It looked like he would soon be caught, but seeing a mountain in the distance, he prayed to it for help and his horse rose from the ground and flew over the river to the top of the mountain. In Mongolia, the horse is \\"omnipresent in song, in stories, and in art.\\" One legend revolves around the invention of the horsehead fiddle, a favorite Mongolian instrument. In this tale, a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse‚Äôs wings cut off, so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail hair, and used it to play poignant songs about his horse. Another legend about the origin of the horsehead fiddle claims that it was invented by a boy named S√ºkhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to S√ºkhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first horsehead fiddle was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head. Horses are common characters in Mongolian folklore. The frequently recurring motif of the young foal who becomes separated from his family and must make his way in the world alone is a type of story that has been described as endemic to Mongolian culture. The horse also figures prominently in song. In 1934, Haslund wrote, \\"Of forty-two Mongolian songs which I noted down in my years in Mongolia no less than seventeen are about horses. They have titles like: 'The little black with velvet back,' 'The dun with lively ears,' and they are all full of touching evidences of the Mongol's love for his horses.\\"Haslund, Henning. In Secret Mongolia, p. 112. Given the deep integration of horses into Mongolian culture, the Mongols have a large vocabulary of equine terminology. There are over 500 words in the Mongolian language describing the traits of horses, with 250 terms for coat color/pattern alone.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 53 In Mongolian literature, this rich vocabulary leads to constructions that seem wordy in English, i.e. a Mongol poet may say, \\"He rode a 3 year old dun mare with a black stripe down its back\\" rather than \\"he rode a horse.\\" =Epic poems= Mongolian epic poems always assign a special horse to the hero. The horse may be born at the same time as the hero or just before him. It possesses great strength, speed, magic, and intelligence. The horse may have the power to magically change its shape; it provides the hero with counsel, and can even predict the future. As regards the latter ability, one plot development that occurs repeatedly is the disaster that results when the hero disregards his horse's advice. In other epics the hero cannot defeat his monstrous manggus foe without asking for help from his horse. The horse may even use its magical powers to assist the hero in courting his beloved. \\"From the frequency of the horse motif in this tradition, one could easily get the impression that horses are as important as their masters. We have not yet found any epic in this nomadic tradition that is without a steed and the assistance it provides.\\" In the Jangar Epic One of the three traditional Mongolian oral epics is the Jangar, in which horses play roles almost as important as those of the heroes. The most famous horse from the epic is Aranjagaan, Jangar's mount. Aranjagaan was sired by a seven-year-old Heavenly Horse who came down to mate with a mortal mare by a lake. (There is intertextual conflict about this later in the epic, where Aranjagaan's father is described as an ordinary horse who was ridden by Jangar's father.) Aranjagaan's capabilities are described in epic style: \\"He was red all over and had a body the size of a hill. He had a huge tail and ears. He had hooves the size of a sheep pen and a butt as hard as cast iron. As soon as he was born, he hissed and frightened away wolves, which had stalked near the stall. At the age of one, he joined a war. At two, he fought wars north and south. He was in his prime at the age of seven. Aranjagaan hissed excitedly, making tree leaves, grasses and stones thunder and even frightening boars dozens of baraa away. His power seemed to radiate from within him. One leap forward would bring his rider hundreds of meters away. His power would hold anyone in great awe. His red brilliance was fiery and dazzled everyone who saw him. ... Even Aranjagaan's roaring shook enemies and weakened their knees.\\"He Dexiu Translated by Pan Zhongming, 2011. The Epic of Jangar. Nor are these epic descriptions limited to Aranjagaan. Even the nameless horses like Altan Gheej's crimson mount have poetically glorified capabilities. The crimson horse is described as having a tail 80 feet long and ears like pestles. It can run at a full gallop for two months straight and swim across a sea for 25 days. Moligen Tabuga's scarlet horse is described as being as large as forty- nine seas. Sanale's red horse has ears like iron bars. These sizes and abilities are typical for all epic steeds in the Jangar. In particular, the size of the tail, ears, and hooves are praised, though occasionally one will find the horse's legs described as tree trunks, etc. It is the horses, not the heroes, that claim divine ancestry. Indeed, the motif of the divinely born horse is repeated in the epic, as when the history of Aletan Kale's wondrous buff and white horse is given: \\"The horse's father was from heaven. The heavenly horse met and mated with a beautiful female horse at the bank of Kas Lake. Then the heavenly horse licked her face and flew away, leaving a heartbroken companion. The female horse gave birth to the buff and white horse with endless expectations.\\" Horses like the buff and white and Aranjagaan are themselves considered divine on account of their parentage. In Mongolian epics, horses save their riders in battle and even fight alongside of them. When Jangar is struck with a poisoned arrow, Aranjagaan realizes what has happened and carefully carries Jangar to safety. To keep his swaying master from toppling off, the horse skillfully leans back and forth, even going so far as to crouching down his forelegs or hindlegs when ascending and descending hills to keep his back level. When they arrive at a house, he lays down to let his rider gently fall off. On another occasion, Aranjagaan runs to a place where a battle is occurring and begins to fight, riderless, alongside the hero. During fights, the epic narrative typically switches back and forth between describing the combat of riders and the actions of their horses, i.e. the hero throws a spear, then the hero's horse lunges forward to pursue an enemy. In battles, the poets describe the horse as a self-willed actor. There are few descriptions of rein-pulling or leg guidance; rather, the impression is that the horse chooses how best to carry on the fight as it works in concert with its rider. The horses bite and kick enemies, and will even bite enemy horses. During a battle, Sanale's red horse \\"provided him with inexhaustible power. It kicked the enemies eighteen thousand times from the left and then eighteen thousand times from the right so that the spears, broadswords, and arrows were broken. It fought like a huge eagle extending its wings.\\" Horses can be wounded. In a long-running battle, Altan Gheej's crimson horse is \\"beaten black and blue and scabbed all over. With eyes covered by blood, the horse was nearly trapped by the enemy several times. Seeing the situation was urgent, Altan Gheej whipped the horse to the sea and swam for awhile. The blood was cleaned and the wounds healed up magically.\\" The horses are eager for battle. When Hongor's livid horse sees Hongor equipped for war, it kicks and snorts with excitement. The horses often have adventures of their own, like getting caught in a whirlpool and escaping by grabbing a branch in their teeth and hauling themselves onto shore. The poet does not fail to describe the horse's exhausted collapse on the bank, the rider's concern, and the horse's subsequent recovery as it stands up, joyfully shakes its mane, and begins cropping grass. Mongolian poets consider it important to describe a horse's feelings and actions as well as those of the human characters. For example, when Jangar stops to drink at a cool stream and delights in the beauty of nature, the poet also notes that Aranjagaan grazes and enjoys a roll in the grass. On another pleasant excursion, Aranjagaan's rider begins to sing, and Aranjagaan moves his hooves in time with the song. Heroes and horses converse with one another on a regular basis. The hero will urge and rebuke his horse, demanding more speed, as when Altan Gheej says to his crimson horse after 50 days and nights of running, \\"Aren't you known as a 'flying arrow' or a 'blue eagle'? Why haven't you crossed over your enclosure after so many days? If so, when can we arrive at our destination?\\" or when swimming a sea, \\"A hero in need is a hero indeed. Where is your mighty power? How can you get adrift like this?\\" The horses will also tell their riders when they can't give anymore. For example, when Sanale is fleeing a devil, his sweating, exhausted horse says, \\"My master, I have tried my best and cannot run faster. Please get rid of the devil, or else we will both have trouble.\\" On another occasion, Sanale's red horse neighs loudly to wake his master from a deep, drunken slumber, then rebukes him for sleeping when he should be killing devils. Sanale, ashamed, apologizes to the horse. The red horse replies impassively, \\"Drinking delays and drinking hard kills.\\" Heroes in the Jangar show great affection for their horses. They will rub their horse's nose affectionately and care for them in times of hardship. When Sanale was forced to flee into the Gobi desert, he and his horse became exhausted with hunger and thirst. The horse saw a plant that it recognized as poisonous, but couldn't resist eating it. Immediately it collapsed in agony. Weeping, Sanale grasped the horse's neck and told it that he had nothing to give it but his own flesh, but that they must go on or their enemies would kill them. The horse was deeply moved at his master's concern and cried. It heroically managed to rise and bear Sanale away. When the horse later collapses, Sanale tries to help it stand. Eventually, afraid that his pursuers will harm the weakened horse, Sanale hides it in a cave while he fights them off. During an exhausting battle, Sabar's maroon horse gasps, \\"Master, we have fought for seven days, and I feel dizzy and giddy due to lack of food and water. Can we just rush out and find something to eat?\\" Sabar leaves the battlefield, finds fodder for his horse, takes a nap while it eats its fill, then returns to the battle and continues fighting. The epic horses are considered precious possessions, and the quality of a man's horse reveals his status and wealth. When introducing a new hero, the poets inevitably include a description of the hero's prized steed. One of the descriptions of Sanale, for instance, is that \\"he rides a crimson horse rarely seen on the steppes.\\" Sabar is introduced by describing that he has \\"an unparalleled sorrel steed worth 100,000 slaves.\\" The horse's fittings are also important. The poet describes Jangar's beautiful clothes, then adds that Aranjagaan was fitted with a golden halter and long silver reins. Because of their value, horses are also important in peace negotiations; for example, Jangar seeks to buy peace from Sanale by offering him the twelve best horses in his herd. The horses, Aranjagaan in particular, are also subject to ransom demands by covetous enemy Khans. On various occasions, hostile Khans demand Aranjagaan as tribute to avoid war. One of the threatened consequences for a defeated enemy is to have all his horses driven off by the victor. The horses play key roles throughout the story, providing information and assisting the heroes against enemies against enemies. Sanale is almost seduced by a hungry devil disguised as a beautiful temptress, but his horse snorts and blows up her skirt, revealing shaggy legs. Altan Gheej's crimson horse is hitched to the eaves of an enemy Khan's palace and pulls until the entire palace collapses. Sabar's maroon horse magically finds out that Sabar's homeland is being attacked and conveys a message from Jangar to Sabar, asking him to return and save him. The fact that horses serve as meat animals in Mongolian culture is not ignored in the epic. Sanale warns his red horse that if their enemies catch them, they will eat him and make his equine skin into boots. The heroes carry dry horse meat as provisions as they ride off. During a critical moment in a battle, Hongor says to his horse, \\"You are my dearest brother, a rare horse. You have never been beaten. If you fail today, I will skin you and eat your meat!\\" The horse finds fresh strength and fights on. On another occasion, a different hero warns Aranjagaan that the horse will suffer a similar fate if he doesn't arrive in time to help in a critical battle. Aranjagaan replies that he will make it in time, but that if the hero does not win the battle when they arrive, Aranjagaan will buck him off and break his neck. A Catalogue of Horses In keeping with the Mongolian tradition of not giving horses names, most of the horses in the Jangar do not have names, but are instead identified by their physical traits. Each horse has a color that sets him apart from the rest. Character - Horse * Jangar - Aranjagaan, Aranzhale * Altan Gheej - red horse * Mengen Shigshirge - Oyomaa, the black horse * Sanale - crimson/red horse * Big Belly Guzan Gongbei - black horse \\"elephant-like\\" * Moligen Tabuga - scarlet horse * Sabar - sorrel horse with white nose, maroon horse * Hongor - livid horse * Daughter of Wuchuuhen Tib - yellow horse * Jaan Taij - yellow leopard horse * Odon Chagaan - yellow horse =Other= In the Mongolian version of chess, the most powerful piece is the horse. Products Mongolian airag (fermented horse milk) In Mongolia, horses are a fairly cheap commodity. In 2014, a good Mongol horse could be purchased for $140; a merely decent one for $100, and a race horse for $800 ‚Äì $1000. In 1934 Henning Haslund reported seeing endless herds that stretched out as far as he could see. One man of his acquaintance owned no less than 14,000 horses. Mongolian horses are valued for their milk, meat and hair. William of Rubruck described the historical milking process as follows: \\"They stretch a long rope on the ground fixed to two stakes stuck in the ground, and to this rope they tie toward the third hour the colts of the mares they want to milk. Then the mothers stand near their foal, and allow themselves to be quietly milked; and if one is too wild, then a man takes the colt and brings it to her, allowing it to suck a little; then he takes it away and the milker takes its place.\\" Much the same procedure is still used today. In the summer, mares are milked six times a day, once every two hours. A mare produces an average of 0.11 lbs of milk each time, with a yearly production of 662 lbs total. The milk is used to make the ubiquitous fermented drinks of Mongolia, airag and kumis. One particular variety of \\"black\\" kumis, caracosmos, was made entirely from the milk of black mares; this was reserved for the aristocracy. William of Rubruck reported that Batu Khan had the milk of three thousand mares collected and sent to his court on a daily basis. In large herds, the gentlest animals are the preferred milk horses. Milk is also boiled and dried into hard white chunks that can be stored and eaten on journeys. During the communist era, Mongolian factories and mines continued to maintain herds of horses specifically for the purposes of providing airag for their workers, which was considered necessary for health and productivity. The milking of horses begins midway through July and lasts till late November, sometimes going as long as early December. Of the various animals milked by Mongolians, horses give milk for the second longest period of time (cattle give milk for a longer period). A lama's advice may be sought for the most auspicious date to begin milking. An offering of the first milk may also be made to the spirits at this time.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 54, 58. For example, during a spring celebration, a lama may sprinkle the first mare's milk of the year over an ovoo.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 130. Horse meat sausageHorses are considered meat animals in Mongolia. Each 600 lb. Mongol horse yields about 240 lbs. of meat. The horse in question may be an old, barren, injured or unneeded animal, such as a stallion who has lived past his prime. The meat of horses is considered to be safer to eat than the meat of other livestock. As one Mongolian explained, \\"Because the horse does not get diseases that other livestock become sick of, [sic] such as tuberculosis and other inflammation diseases, its meat and milk are considered to be clean.\\" William of Rubruck reported that the Mongols used the intestines of the horses to make sausages. Horses are considered to have the fourth most desirable kind of meat, after sheep, cattle and goats. Mature animals are preferred to young ones, as the taste is considered better. Horses are slaughtered in late November when the animals are at their fattest; it is considered bad practice to slaughter them in the summer.Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 60. They would also use the leather from the rear part of the horse's hide to make shoes. Horse skin was one of the materials used for making the bowstring of the Mongols' infamous composite bow. The skin of horses was preferred over that of other animals because it was said to keep its flexibility despite the frigid temperatures of the steppe. Mongol warriors also wore armor made from horse leather soaked in horse urine. The drums used by shamans in rituals were often made of horse hide. The horse's hair can be used for a number of products. Horsehair ties are part of the traditional Mongolian tent dwelling. The hair can also be used to make rope; it is considered better than leather in wet conditions, because water can be easily shaken out of a horsehair rope but not a leather one. One traditional rope-making technique called for a combination of one third horse hair to two thirds wool. Tail hair was also used in the creation of musical instruments. The traditional Mongolian horsehead fiddle has two strings made of horse hair. The \\"male\\" string is made from 136 tail hairs from a stallion, while the \\"female\\" string is made from 105 tail hairs from a mare. The bow is also made of horse hair coated with resin. Due to the spiritual significance of a horse's mane, black and white mane hair was used to make spirit banners (tugs). Black hair indicated a war tug and white hairs a peace tug. The black hair was taken from bay horses. Warriors wore a peaked helmet with a plume of horsehair on top. Since there is little wood on the steppe, dry animal dung is gathered as fuel for fire. Bruun notes, \\"...horse dung especially (and perhaps surprisingly to the uninitiated) gives off a nice fragrance resembling that of incense.\\"Bruun, Ole. Precious Steppe, p. 62. Famous Horses Mongolians do not give their horses names; rather, they identify them by their color, markings, scars, and brands. Perhaps due to the Mongolian habit of not naming their horses, there are few widely known individuals of the breed. One exception to this rule is Arvagarkheer, an 18th century race horse who beat over 1,000 other horses in a race. The city of Arvaikheer was named after him, and he has a painted statue with a blue scarf tied around the neck in Arvaikheer valley. When U.S Vice President Joe Biden visited Mongolia, he was given a Mongol horse as a gift. He named it \\"Celtic\\" and tied two ceremonial knots in the blue silk scarf around the horse's neck. This spooked the horse and it reared, and was led off.

Life and music Glover was born in Dublin, where he initially became an orchestral violinist as early as 1830. In 1848, he succeeded Haydn Corri as organist of St. Mary's Pro- Cathedral, Dublin, and also became professor of music at the Central Model Schools of the Board of National Education.Paul Collins: \\"Glover, John Williams\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. H. White & B. Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 435. An experienced choral conductor, he established the short-lived Choral Institute of Dublin in 1851. He presented a series of \\"National Concerts\\" in 1853 to commemorate Thomas Moore one year after the poet's death, and also co-organised and conducted large musical performances on the occasion of the centenaries of Daniel O'Connell (1875) and Thomas Moore (1879). As a composer, Glover was one of a handful of native composers who cultivated (classical) musical life in Dublin in the mid-19th century ‚Äì and among these the only one of Roman Catholic denomination. A personal friend of the √©migr√©s Michael William Balfe and William Vincent Wallace, he, too, was inclined towards opera, despite the incomparably more difficult circumstances in Ireland in this period. His most ambitious work was the three-act opera The Deserted Village (libretto by Edmund Falconer after Oliver Goldsmith's novel of the same name), performed in Dublin in 1880 and published in London. In it, \\"Glover uses a very direct diatonic language that is not sentimental but speaks to his assured facility for setting words to music\\",Axel Klein: \\"Stage-Irish, or The National in Irish Opera 1780‚Äì1925\\", in: Opera Quarterly 21 (2005) 1, p. 41. it was also described as a \\"populist style\\".Joseph J. Ryan: \\"Opera in Ireland Before 1925\\", in: Irish Music in the Twentieth Century (Irish Musical Studies) vol. 7, ed. A. Klein & G. Cox (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2003), p. 43. To a very limited extent he makes use of Irish traditional music, but even so it is an important work in the canon of Irish national opera. Other large-scale works include the \\"national oratorio\\" St Patrick at Tara (1875), written for the O'Connell Centenary, and the cantata One Hundred Years Ago (1879) for the Moore Centenary. He also wrote a violin concerto (date unknown)See Collins (2013). Glover was also an expert on Irish traditional music. He lectured widely on this subject in Dublin, London, and Paris. Among his publications is one of the earliest collective volumes of Thomas Moore's Irish Melodies (to Glover's accompaniments, published by James Duffy, Dublin, 1859), and he collaborated with Patrick Weston Joyce, providing the piano accompaniments to his Ancient Irish Music (Dublin: McGlashan & Gill, 1873). Glover died in Dublin. He was the grandfather of Jimmy Glover, director of music at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, from 1893 to 1920.M. C.

Cohen introducing the ideas behind American histories of China since 1840. It was published by Columbia University Press in 1984 and reprinted with a new preface in 2010. Cohen presents a sympathetic critique of the dominant paradigms associated with John K. Fairbank and the historians he trained which shaped the field of Area Studies after World War II: \\"China's response to the West\\" (or \\"impact-response\\") and \\"Tradition and Modernity,\\" which were popular in the 1950s, and Imperialism, which became fashionable in the 1960s in response to American involvement in Vietnam. Cohen, himself trained by Fairbank, sees these paradigms as placing China in a passive role and not being capable of change without a Western impact. Cohen's critique Cohen prefaces the book by explaining ‚ÄúPeople who are not historians sometimes think of history as the facts about the past. Historians are supposed to know otherwise.... As times change, concerns shift... each generation of historians must rewrite the history written by the preceding generation.‚Äù Up through World War II, he continues, ‚ÄúAmerican writing tended to stress those aspects which the West itself had been most immediately concerned,\\" an intellectual bias which ‚Äúequated modern with Western with important; for many Americans of this era, even educated ones, Westernized China and modern China were indistinguishable.‚Äù :My real quibble in this book is not with the disciplined, descriptive, application of terms like imperialism, impact, response, or even modern to specific, precisely delimited processes or phenomena that have emerged in the past century or so of Chinese history; what I object to is the use of these concepts as broad, overarching intellectual constructs purporting to tell us what was important ‚Äì and by implication not important ‚Äì about an entire period of historical time. Chapter 1, \\"The Problem with 'China's Response to the West,'\\" focuses on the \\"impact and response\\" framework made popular by Teng Ssu-yu and Fairbank's 1954 volume of annotated translations, China's Response to the West. Chapter 2, \\"Moving Beyond 'Tradition and Modernity'\\" focuses on Joseph R. Levenson, Mary C. Wright, and Albert Feuerwerker, all trained by Fairbank. Cohen is particularly doubtful about the analysis of Joseph Levenson, in such early books as Liang Ch'i-chao and the Mind of Modern China (Harvard University Press, 1954), which assumed that Confucianism and modernity were incompatible and that the traditional order had to be torn down before a modern one could be built up. Likewise Mary Wright, in The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism concluded that for China after the Taiping Rebellion, ‚Äúthe obstacles to successful adaptation to the modern world were not imperialist aggression, Manchu rule, mandarin stupidity, or the accidents of history, but nothing less than the constituent elements of the Confucian system itself.‚Äù Chapter 3. \\"Imperialism: Reality or Myth?\\" does not see the concept \\"imperialism\\" as a useful tool. Chapter 4. \\"Toward a China-Centered History of China\\" calls for \\"China-centered history of China\\" and praises scholarship of the 1970s which shows how to do it. Cohen returned to the problems of historical writing in his Reception Harriet Zurndorfer's history of western Sinology called the work a \\"revealing book\\" and an \\"insider's discussion\\" which traces how scholars can move beyond these \\"Western-centric paradigms\\" towards a \\"China-centered\\" history based on \\"how the Chinese themselves experienced and wrote about it.\\" Reviews in professional journals for the most part greeted the book. Albert Feuerwerker, writing in the Journal of Asian Studies praised Cohen but objected to \\"what I believe to be an undue defensiveness\\" in the analysis of what Cohen calls \\"the intellectual imperialism\\" of American historians, and an \\"excessive gravity\\" in treating \\"jejeune political tracts as 'paradigms'\\" in the chapter on imperialism.\\" Dennis Duncanson was skeptical: \\"there is regrettably little novelty to stimulate reflection in this less than comprehensive survey,\\" and did not agree with \\"finding fault with other people's 'perceptions'.\\" Editions and translations  Sato Shin'ichi, tr., Chi no teikokushugi: Orientizumu to Chugoku zo (Intellectual Imperialism: Orientalism and the image of China) (Heibonsha, Tokyo, 1988). *Lin Tongqi, tr., Zhonghua, Beijing, 1989; expanded edition, Zhonghua, 2005 * Daoxiang Publishing, Taipei, 1991; Lianjing, Taipei, 1991 * Korean: Sansae Publishing Co., Seoul, 2003) Curriculum vitae  References and further reading    Harriet Zurndorfer, (1988) (Review) T'oung Pao Second Series, Vol. 74, Livr. 1/3 (1988), pp. 150‚Äì154 . * Notes  External links  * Review Category:1984 non-fiction books Category:Historiography of China Category:History books about China ","title":"Discovering History in China"},{"id":"43692461","text":"Fred Durhal Jr. (born 1951) was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives.2013‚Äì2014 Michigan Manual: State Representative Fred Durhal, Jr. Durhal was born in Rochester, New York and moved to Detroit in 1952.

The complex includes four major structures and seven smaller ones, on about of land along the Salmon Falls River. They were built between about 1840 and the mid-1860s, and have an unusual architectural unity, for additions made to the buildings were done with attention to matching design elements from the existing structures. The Number 2 Mill, built in 1848, was an early location where a turbine was used instead of a waterwheel to provide power to the mill machinery. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The area that is now Rollinsford was settled in the 1620s, and the site of the present Salmon Mills complex has a documented history of industrial use since 1623-24, when the Salmon Falls River was first dammed and a sawmill built. In 1822 the water privilege was purchased by a Portsmouth merchant, who established a successful woolen mill. It burned in 1834, but was soon replaced by a cotton mill. That mill was eventually purchased by a partnership including Amos Lawrence, a major Boston, Massachusetts textile industrialist. Eventually incorporated as the Salmon Falls Manufacturing Company, Lawrence and his associates built a new mill (the present Number 2 building), and introduced new technology perfected at Lowell, Massachusetts including the turbine. A fire in 1864 destroyed the original Number 1 mill. The Salmon Falls Manufacturing Company ended production in 1927, and the buildings have since seen other industrial uses. The historic district consists of eleven buildings and structures, most of which are set between Front Street and the river. The concrete dam spanning the river, built as a replacement of a wooden dam around 1910, is included in the district, as is the railroad bridge just downstream. One building, a cotton warehouse, is located across Front Street. The buildings exhibit a remarkable unity of style despite a construction history spanning more than 50 years, with most buildings built of brick in an industrial Italianate style.

It has become part of the Hong Kong's food culture. Cha Chaan Teng buffet originated in a tea restaurant located in Tsuen Wan. The motive for this buffet was to resist inflation. After being promoted by the media, many other restaurants followed to provide it. It is new and innovative to provide such a buffet in Hong Kong style.  History  It shows how the Cha Chaan Teng Buffet were running Fei Du Du Cha Chaan Teng, owned by Stephen Cheng in Tsuen Wan, was the first restaurant letting consumers order buffet on 1 March 2013 which creates a new dining trend. The idea first appeared 10 years ago when Stephen was facing high rent and he decided to try a new method to run his business.Lai Chun Kin, \\"Fei Du Du Cha Chaan Teng gained a great success in providing buffet menu\\", nextmedia.com, 21/03/2013 Although in the first week of launching the buffet, it was not as popular as his expectation. After media report on the new concept, there was long queue waiting to be served. With reported success, several restaurants tried to follow the trend, including Wo Heng Restaurant.  Characteristics  Cha Chaan Teng buffet is rich in Hong Kong local culture. Take Fei Du Du Cha Chaan Teng as an example. Both Chinese and Western food is served. Buffet in hotels may have greater variety of food offered, but would rarely present Hong Kong a mixed cultural place. Moreover, Cha Chaan Teng is a local restaurant with cheaper price, comparing to other restaurants in Hong Kong. When such a place needs to set up a buffet as gimmick in order to survive, it reflects that Hong Kong's high inflation is hard for small-scale, independent shops to survive.  Menu  Just like other tea restaurants, Cha Chaan Teng Buffet provides food and drinks such as French toast, sandwiches, various Fried rice and Chinese noodles. For drinks, it offers Hong Kong style milk tea, coffee, ‚ÄòYuanyang‚Äô, lemon tea and so on. The price of the buffet ranges from $40 to $80. In one of the restaurants, consumers can choose to have either a $40 or $80 buffet. Consumers who choose to have $40 can have breakfast, lunch or tea buffet. Those who pay $80 can have the dinner buffet. Both these two sets of buffet provide one free drink to consumers.  Customer opinion  Most of the customers are pleased with this brand new selling method. The restaurant owners were appreciated because of their effort of competing with the high inflation rate. Most of the customers still think that was acceptable when the owner increase the price. A netizen, ‚ÄúQoo‚Äù said that, ‚Äú It is reasonable to raise the price otherwise there is no way for this kind of small restaurants to survive.‚ÄùSam Shui Ching, \\"Cha Chaan Teng Buffet, customers still support even the price increased to $40\\", HKET.com, 14/03/2013 Meanwhile, Mr. Chan living in Sham Shui Po also said the meal was almost 70% cheaper than the meal having in the industrial regions nearby.tsui8, \\"$3o Buffet in Cha Chaan Teng netizens group together to eat there customers said that they will feel shame if they eat too much\\", Discuss.hk, 09/03/2013 While some are opposing the raising of price, they think that the original intention of the buffet may be changed.

Like Douglas McCain (another American jihadist, killed in Syria in 2014), he was born in the US and attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School in New Hope, Minnesota, and the two may have been roommates for a while. Biography Kastigar was born in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Minnesota Birth Index, 1935-2002, Minnesota Department of Health, Minneapolis. He and his younger brother, Thomas, were raised by their mother, who was single. He took karate lessons in Golden Valley, Minnesota, when he was ten and earned a black belt; his instructor remembered him as \\"very respectful, polite, upbeat, positive\\". Police reports listed him as white, though his mother claimed Native American heritage. Kastigar attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School from 1997‚Äì99, and dropped out in February 1999. Robbinsdale Cooper was also the school Douglas McCain attended; McCain may have lived in Kastigar's house between 2000 and 2001, and the two played basketball together at the local community center, sometimes with a group of Somali men. Kastigar, like McCain, had a criminal record with minor offenses including \\"charges of disorderly conduct, traffic violations and instances in which they [he and McCain] gave false names to police officers\\". He converted to Islam after high school and adopted the name Abdirahman. He left Minneapolis in November 2008, apparently with a group of Somali men he had met in Minnesota: Al-Shabaab was reportedly recruiting heavily in the Twin Cities area. Kastigar was killed in September 2009 in Somalia, according to a 2011 report; he was the fifth or sixth person from Minnesota to die there, and the first US citizen of that group. In August 2013 al-Shabaab released a promotional video, \\"Minnesota's Martyrs: The Path to Paradise\\", in which Kastigar said he was living in \\"the real Disneyland\\", but that video also showed his corpse.

Though the rivalry has been largely dormant since the 1980s, it was once contested annually as a season-ending game that \\"determined the best team in New England\\", as one player recalled. As of 2018, even after not playing each other for more than 30 years, each school was still the other's all-time most- played football opponent. The two teams have met 83 times; Boston College leads the series 49‚Äì31‚Äì3. They last played in 2018, after a 32-year hiatus, and were scheduled to meet again in 2020, but the meeting was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2012, Wally Carew wrote a book about the rivalry, \\"A Farewell to Glory: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Football Rivalry\\".Carew, Walter Jr., A Farewell to Glory: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Football Rivalry. 2012. Xlibris Corp. .  History  In 1896, Holy Cross and Boston College played the first football game between the two schools, starting one of the most storied rivalries in college football.Beck, Stan, and Jack Wilkinson (2013). College Sports Traditions: Picking Up Butch, Silent Night, and Hundreds of Others. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press. p. 248. . Part of the rivalry's intensity stems from the school's shared tradition as Roman Catholic, Jesuit colleges -- in fact, both were founded by the same bishop, Benedict Joseph Fenwick. The rivalry is also geographic, as the two schools are located 41 miles apart from each other in Massachusetts, and represent the state's two largest cities. For much of the early to mid-20th century, Boston College and Holy Cross drew some of New England's largest sports crowds. To accommodate larger crowds, Boston College would schedule its Holy Cross home dates at larger venues off campus, with the 1916 matchup taking place at the Boston Red Sox' newly constructed Fenway Park. A record 54,000 attended the 1922 game at Braves Field, home of the Boston Braves baseball team. The rivalry was relatively evenly matched through the mid-1960s; by the end of 1966, Boston College held a slight edge in victories, 31-28, with 3 ties. = Decline = By the mid-1970s, however, it was clear that the rivalry was no longer competitive, as Boston College had reeled off nine straight victories, six of them by margins of 20 points or more. The split in athletic aspirations became apparent in 1978, when the NCAA divided Division I into two groupings for football: the premier Division I-A (now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision) and the second-tier Division I-AA (now known as the Football Championship Subdivision). Initially, both Boston College and Holy Cross competed as Division I-A independents, but BC's schedule featured matchups with \\"power conference\\" teams, while most of Holy Cross' opponents were from the Ivy League or from Division I-AA. After the 1981 season, the NCAA voted to reclassify both Holy Cross and its Ivy League opponents as Division I-AA schools. This left Boston College as the only remaining Division I-A school in New England, granting it a recruiting tool to attract prospective athletes wishing to play at the highest level and hoping to get noticed by National Football League scouts. As a I-A school, Boston College was increasingly out of place on Holy Cross' schedule, which consisted largely of I-AA Ivy League and Yankee Conference members. Holy Cross had also turned coeducational in 1970 without expanding its student body, thereby cutting its male population in half. By 1980, the Holy Cross rivalry game was no longer part of Boston College's student ticket package, and was mostly attended by alumni. In 1987, BC wide receiver Darren Flutie -- who had caught his first collegiate touchdown in a Holy Cross game in 1984, from his brother, former BC quarterback Doug Flutie -- acknowledged that the rivalry was no longer competitive. \\"I think the intensity is there, because so much is said and written during BC-Holy Cross week,\\" Darren Flutie said. \\"But it was definitely a game we think is an automatic win. It was a chance to show we could dominate. We could show how much stronger we are than a Division I-AA school.\\" Boston College outscored Holy Cross in the final five 1980s games, 221-60, but BC head coach Jack Bicknell said he didn't take them for granted. \\"You know, I never thought our series was a mismatch,\\" he said. \\"Holy Cross always was competitive and well coached.\\" = Cancelation = Following nine years of losses, including six consecutive blowouts, the Rev. John E. Brooks, Holy Cross' president, announced in February 1987 that he would end the annual rivalry. Brooks said the change was \\"to provide Holy Cross coaches and players with an opportunity to compete in an environment that encourages balance and fair competition.\\" Holy Cross' withdrawal from the rivalry was effective immediately, leaving Boston College with only half a year to plug a hole in its 1987 fall schedule. Coach Jack Bicknell hoped to pick up another Division I-AA opponent, but with most schools planning their schedules years -- even decades -- in advance, finding a matchup was difficult. In the end, Boston College was able to schedule a game with Texas Christian University, coming off a 3-7 campaign as members of the Southwest Conference, because NCAA sanctions had canceled TCU's game against Southern Methodist University. While Boston College was scheduling games against opponents such as Notre Dame and USC, the Crusaders had helped found the Colonial League (later to be renamed the Patriot League). Holy Cross won the 1986 Colonial League title and went 10-0 in Division I-AA play -- but its final game was a 56-26 blowout loss to Boston College, the last rivalry game played in the 1980s. As part of its commitment to the Colonial League, Holy Cross stopped offering athletic scholarships for football in the late 1980s. = Return = The Patriot League relaxed its prohibition on scholarships in the 2010s. This allowed Boston College to consider renewing its rivalry after a three-decade pause. If an FBS team beats a non-scholarship FCS team, it does not count as a win for the purposes of qualifying for postseason bowl games. If Holy Cross could field a team with 57 students on scholarship, the game would count toward championship ratings. \\"The main reason was that we have two institutions that have a long and storied rivalry,\\" said BC athletic director Brad Bates, announcing that his team would host Holy Cross in 2018 and 2020. \\"And the opportunity to renew that rivalry really seemed to us to be an exciting chance to merge the two institutions and bring us together for a couple of games.\\" Rather than being the culmination of the schedule for both teams, the rivalry is now more of an early-season tuneup game for an ACC member hosting an FCS underdog. While many alumni of both schools welcomed the return of a traditional opponent, The Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy -- a Holy Cross alumnus -- said \\"the past is the past\\", and the game would simply \\"give the alums a great opportunity to convene and talk about the glory days.\\"  Notable games  As it was often the last game of the season for both teams, the Boston College‚ÄìHoly Cross matchup provided an opportunity for one team -- usually Holy Cross -- to play spoiler to the other team's winning streak or postseason plans. = 1896: Disputed result = After Boston College won the first matchup in 1896, the teams met for a rematch a week later. The game devolved into a fight and ended inconclusively, with both sides claiming victory. Boston College's claim of an 8-6 victory is reflected in the listings and totals on this page, but as of 2019, Holy Cross' record book continues to list this game as a 6-4 win for the Crusaders. = 1940: BC undefeated = In 1940, Boston College went into Fenway Park and shut out the Crusaders 7‚Äì0 en route to a perfect season and the program's only national title to date. = 1942: Cocoanut Grove = On November 28, 1942, Holy Cross beat Orange Bowl-bound Boston College in \\"arguably the biggest upset in college football history\\", 55‚Äì12, at Fenway Park. The game is famous not only for the final score, which ruined BC's bid for an undefeated season, but also its aftermath. The Eagles had booked their victory party that night at the popular Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Boston, but canceled after the loss. As a result, they were absent when the club caught fire, killing 492. = 1949: Most lopsided win = Boston College wins 76-0 in the series' most lopsided game, played November 26, 1949, at Braves Field. = 1957: Bowl bid ruined = In the first rivalry game to be played at Worcester since 1932, the underdog Crusaders beat the Eagles, 14-0, ruining BC's bid for a Gator Bowl berth. = 1977-78: Last HC wins = Having lost the rivalry game for the previous nine consecutive meetings, Holy Cross reeled off its last two wins, 35-20 in 1977 in Worcester, and 30-29 in 1978 in Chestnut Hill. In the 1977 game, Holy Cross came in as a 35-point underdog. The 1978 loss was less surprising, as it was the final game in Boston College's first-ever winless season, 0-11. The BC-HC matchup would continue to be played annually for eight more years, all BC wins. Game results Disputed result; Holy Cross records this as a Holy Cross victory, 6-4.

Government forces were forced to retreat from Novoazovsk to the city of Mariupol, leaving DPR forces in control. Events DPR forces stated their intention to \\"fight their way to the Azov Sea\\" on 23 August. In line with this statement, an artillery barrage was launched at the coastal city of Novoazovsk, in southern Donetsk Oblast. A column of armoured vehicles crossed into Ukraine from Russia near Novoazovsk on 25 August. There were no insurgent formations within of this area for many weeks. Heavy fighting took place in the village of Markyne, from Novoazovsk. Insurgents used the village to shell Novoazovsk. A spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC) said that the entrance of the column into Ukraine was an attempt \\"by the Russian military in the guise of Donbass fighters to open a new area of military confrontation\\". According to the Mariupol city website, the Dnipro and Donbas battalions repelled the attack, and the \\"invaders\\" retreated to the border. The Ukrainian military spokesman Andryi Lysenko claimed two Russian tanks destroyed and 10 members of \\"an intelligence- sabotage group\\" captured. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had no knowledge of the incident, and suggested that reports of the incident being an incursion by Russian forces were \\"disinformation.\\" Directly prior to the appearance of the column, the area was heavily shelled. The nearest insurgent artillery positions were beyond the range of this area. DPR insurgents, with Russian support, shelled Novoazovsk from across the Russian border on 26 August. Ukrainian border guards stationed at the Novoazovsk‚ÄìVeselo‚ÄìVoznesenka border-crossing showed reporters craters that they said were caused by shelling from Russian territory. Russia denied any involvement, and said that DPR forces had been acting on their own. According to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, this shelling was an attempt to take-out Ukrainian artillery positions in the area. As the shelling occurred, smoke could be seen rising over the city, whilst many residents fled in cars and lorries. Four civilians were wounded in the shelling. Insurgents pushed into Novoazovsk on 27 August. Whilst the Ukrainian government said they were in \\"total control\\" of Novoazovsk, town mayor Oleg Sidorkin confirmed that the insurgents had captured it. He also said that \\"dozens\\" of tanks and armoured vehicles had been used by the insurgents in their assault on the town. At least four civilians were injured by insurgent shelling. To the north, close to Starobesheve, Ukrainian forces said that they spotted a column of 100 armoured vehicles, tanks, and Grad rocket lorries that was heading south, toward Novoazovsk. They said these vehicles were marked with \\"white circles or triangles\\", similar to white armbands seen on Russian paratroopers that were captured by government forces in Ukrainian territory a few days earlier. Amidst pressure on this new third front, government forces retreated westward toward Mariupol. A statement by the NSDC later said that Novoazovsk had been captured by \\"Russian troops\\", despite earlier denials by the Ukrainian government. According to the NSDC, Ukrainian troops withdrew from Novoazovsk to save lives, and were instead preparing defences in Mariupol. =Russian involvement= Ukraine and western governments say that Russian troops either facilitated or took part in the attack on Novoazovsk. By the time that the city fell to the attackers, NATO said that there were at least 1,000 Russian soldiers operating on Ukrainian soil. One DPR commander said that his own forces took over Novoazovsk, and that he had support from \\"Russian volunteers\\". By 1 September, Russian troops seemed to have vanished from the town, which was then being guarded by DPR insurgents. Despite this, some locals said that there were \\"little green men\\" outside the town, referencing a term used during the events that led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia to refer to the unmarked Russian forces that took over the peninsula in February 2014. As the battle was ongoing in Novoazovsk, the NSDC released a video showing a T-72 tank in Novoazovsk. The government of Ukraine said that this was proof of the presence of Russian troops on Ukrainian soil.

Background Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and reared in Redlands, California, little is known of Shadegg's early life, including his education. He worked extensively as a writer and published hundreds of stories in pulp magazines before his interest turned to politics. In 1932, he moved to Phoenix, where he authored radio scripts for such programs as \\"Tales of Pioneer Days\\" and \\"Phoenix Sun Ranch Chuck Wagon\\". He spent much of 1939‚Äì1940 in Hollywood, where he wrote scripts for RKO Pictures. He was also a mail-order salesman, polygraph examiner, sheriff's deputy, an insurance agent, and owned a pharmaceutical company. His public relations firm had as its principal clients the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Salt River Project. Shadegg was considered an authority on Arizona water issues. In the late 1940s, he developed a political and religious philosophy based on evangelical principles and opposition to liberal social policy, though he continued to worship as an Episcopalian. He was a vestryman in his Phoenix church and a figure in national Episcopalian affairs too. Political life Over several decades Shadegg managed more than forty campaigns in Arizona for offices at all levels of government. First a Democrat, he worked on the 1942 campaign of Lon Jordan for sheriff of Maricopa County. He managed his first statewide race in 1950, the reelection campaign of U.S. Senator Carl Hayden of Phoenix. By 1952, however, he had switched parties and played the same role as campaign manager for newcomer Barry Goldwater, a former department store-owner from Phoenix who challenged the Senate Majority Leader, Democrat Ernest McFarland. Against four-to-one Democratic registration, Shadegg helped to stage a stunning upset which brought Goldwater to the Senate in 1952, helped by the national popularity of Dwight D. Eisenhower that year. Shadegg was regarded as a shrewd strategist and advisor whose influence extended to the Republican National Committee. Shadegg defined a distinct western political conservatism that set the tone for many later politicians in the region. He subsequently managed all of Goldwater's successful Senate races, 1968, 1974, and 1980. He also managed the reelection of Goldwater in 1958, a very successful year for the Democrats nationwide. In 1960, Shadegg was elected chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. During this time, he ghost authored a nationally syndicated newspaper column, \\"How Do You Stand, Sir?\\", that appeared under Goldwater's name. Those columns provided most of the material that appeared under Goldwater's name in The Conscience of a Conservative, a 1960 political tract written by L. Brent Bozell. He was considered the person closest to Goldwater in political philosophy and as the craftsman of Goldwater as a staunch conservative. In 1962, at Goldwater's urging, Shadegg ran in the Republican primary for the right to challenge Senator Carl Hayden for re- election, but he lost the primary to Evan Mecham, later a short-term governor of Arizona. Goldwater endorsed no candidate in the primary race. Shadegg later said that he was \\"terriby let down\\" by Goldwater's position of neutrality in the primary after Goldwater had urged Shadegg to seek the seat. In 1964, Shadegg served as western regional director of Goldwater's unsuccessful presidential campaign. He managed Goldwater's unsuccessful primary race in Oregon against Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York. For the general election, his western states assignment was Region VII: Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Alaska, and Hawaii. Of those states, only Arizona voted for Goldwater and by a narrow margin over U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Shadegg ran several more campaigns for Republicans, both in Arizona and in several other states. Though associated most closely with Goldwater, he also performed campaign duties at least once for Republicans Karl Mundt of South Dakota, Carl Curtis of Nebraska Gordon Allott of Colorado, Henry Dworshak of Idaho, Keith Thomson of Wyoming, Andrew Frank Schoeppel of Kansas, Paul Laxalt of Nevada, and John Tower of Texas. He was also retained by Moderate Republican U.S. Senators Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky, Clifford P. Case of New Jersey, and Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts. He managed the successful gubernatorial campaigns in Arizona of Paul Fannin and Jack Richard Williams, the latter of whom called Shadegg \\"a real innovator in political campaigns.\\" Shadegg directed the five congressional campaigns of U.S. Representative Eldon Rudd of Arizona's 4th congressional district from 1977 to 1987, for whom he was chief strategist and speechwriter. Literary life In August 1964, he published How to Win an Election: The Art of Political Victory. This book frankly describes Shadegg's belief that voters who are indifferent to issues, who are easily led to vote even against their own interests, provide the margin of victory in elections. Following Goldwater's defeat, he published an insider's account of the campaign, What Happened to Goldwater?, that revealed that Goldwater's national campaign manager, Denison Kitchel, also of Phoenix, had been an early member of the John Birch Society. The New York Times reviewer recommended the book: \\"students of political organization and political philosophy will find many other minor fascinations in these pages, not least of which is the author's ambivalent attitude toward his hero.\\" Shadegg in 1970 authored Claire Boothe Luce: A Biography, which appeared in 1971. William F. Buckley Jr., described it as \\"favorable, but not gushy\\" and wrote that its \\"principal failure\\" was \\"that somehow it does not sufficiently communicate the flavor of her.\\" Luce had given Shadegg access to her papers and press clippings, and he defended himself against suggestions that she exercised control over what he wrote and that he had not interviewed widely. Shadegg said that the \\"more romantic story\\" some wanted about the Republican icon would not have been accurate. In 1972, he published The New How to Win an Election, which Jeff Greenfield called \\"staggeringly unreadable\\" and criticized for relying too closely on his earlier book, with its regional focus and Eisenhower-era issues and for lacking updated material. Others have found Shadegg's emphasis on developing networks of interpersonal communication, which he called social precincts, an early articulation of a strategy now widely-recognized as important. He collaborated with Goldwater on the latter's political memoir With No Apologies, which appeared in 1979. Following its publication by William Morrow & Company, the two successfully sued their original publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for rejecting the manuscript after failing to respond to their requests for editorial assistance. In 1986, he published a memoir: Arizona Politics: The Struggle to End One-Party Rule. Shadegg's papers are held at the Arizona Historical Foundation in Tempe. Family and death Shadegg married Eugenia Kerr, who died in 1988. They had four children, Stephen David Shadegg (1947‚Äì2009), who died of a heart attack while camping in the northern Arizona mountains, and John Barden Shadegg, Cynthia S. Ackel, and Eugenia S. Johnson, all born in Phoenix. Stephen Shadegg died of cancer at his Phoenix home at the age of eighty on April 16, 1990. Younger son John Shadegg managed Arizona political campaigns as had his father, served as a U.S. Representative from Arizona from 1995 to 2011, and then joined the staff of the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix.

He was born in Kolkata, then called Calcutta, in India and died at Corrybrough, Tomatin, Inverness-shire, Scotland. Malkin was the son of Sir Benjamin Heath Malkin, a judge of the supreme court in Calcutta, who died only a year after Herbert was born. His grandfather was also named Benjamin Heath Malkin and was a writer and educator who brought the works of William Blake to public attention. Herbert Malkin was educated at Charterhouse School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating from Cambridge University in 1859 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at Cambridge, Malkin played several cricket matches for the university side, and two of them, both in 1858, have been judged to be of first-class status. He appears to have played as a batsman, though it is not known if he was right- or left-handed, and there is no evidence that he bowled; his only innings of note was a score of 27 made as an opening batsman in the match against the Cambridge Town Club in which he made his first-class debut. He continued to play minor cricket for amateur clubs, including Southgate Cricket Club, across the 1860s but played no more matches with first-class status. After graduating from Cambridge, Malkin worked for a time as a schoolmaster at Charterhouse, his old school, before qualifying as a barrister. From 1871 he acted as Clerk of Public Bills in the Clerk of the Parliaments office in the House of Lords; from 1897 to his retirement in 1901 he had the title \\"chief clerk\\". From 1879 to 1897 he was responsible for the Annual Statutes publication which recorded new laws in the period before the codification of UK statutes under Halsbury's Statutes, and he served on committees dealing with statute law revision. He was also a local politician, being a member of Kensington Borough Council and a Justice of the Peace for the City of London. He inherited a grouse moor estate in Scotland from an uncle and it was there that he died in 1913.

It was first described by the British entomologist George Hampson in 1899. It is found in India and Vietnam where it is commonly known as the Gurdaspur borer because the larvae bore their way into and feed on the stems of sugarcane. Description The adult Bissetia steniellus has a wingspan of . It is generally drab brown, and there are seven darker brown spots arranged between the veins on the outer margins of the forewings. The larva is creamy-white with four narrow, longitudinal, reddish stripes along the body, and an orange head. Distribution B. steniellus is found in India, Pakistan and Vietnam. Its range in India includes the states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Life cycle The only known host plant for B. steniellus is the sugarcane. The female moth lays a batch of 100 to 300 eggs on the midrib of a sugarcane leaf. The larvae hatch out after about a week and make their way into the stem by drilling holes just above a node. They excavate galleries inside the stem, feeding voraciously. When the cane dries up and the crown of leaves dies in about ten days, the larvae move to a different cane in the vicinity. They feed for three to four weeks, passing through five instar stages, before pupating inside a stem. The adult moths emerge in six to twelve days. The male/female ratio varies between forty and sixty percent in the different generations. The whole life cycle lasts about five or six weeks, and there may be two or three generations in each year. Damage B. steniellus does varying amounts of damage to sugarcane crops, 25% of the crop sometimes being affected, with 75% damage known in severe cases. Affected plants are best destroyed and stubble cleared at the end of the season. The organochloride endrin is effective against the pest but is banned in many countries. The fly Sturmiopsis inferens is a naturally occurring parasitoid and its use as a possible biological pest control agent is being investigated. It has proved possible to rear the fly in the laboratory and release it in sugarcane plantations. In the March to June hot season, the fly mainly targets the sugarcane shoot borer (Chilo infuscatellus) and the pink borer (Sesamia inferens). In the monsoon period, July to October, it shifts to B. steniellus. Finally, between November and January, it targets the gold-fringed rice stemborer (Chilo auricilius).

Todd Harris was born in the Massachusetts city of Pittsfield to Robert N. Harris and Eugenie (Schosberg) Harris. His parents soon divorced and he and his mother moved to Manhattan where he lived until 1973. While growing up on Manhattan's upper east side, he attended PS 6, PS 198 and Allen Stevenson (grades 4-8). His mother remarried for the second time to Jeffrey Gross and they moved with Todd and new son Jason Gross to Putnam Valley, New York. Todd attended James O'Neill High School in Highland Falls, NY near West Point. Todd attended Stanford University from 1977-1981. He earned his BA in Political Science and produced, directed and acted in numerous campus stage productions. He also produced concerts for the University and produced the first Stanford Film Festival in 1980. After graduating in 1981, he was named General Manager of TheatreWorks, the Palo Alto-based repertory theatre, where he worked for three years, eventually becoming the Managing Director. In 1984, he returned to Stanford, where he earned his MBA in 1986. Todd moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and worked at TriStar Television before starting his own development fund called Skyline Entertainment Partners (inspired by his rustic college and business school residence in La Honda outside Palo Alto). He soon joined Davis Entertainment as an independent producer, where he stayed for 13 years, founding Davis Entertainment Filmworks, the company's independent film division. Partnered with John Davis, the company was based at 20th Century Fox.

The Kids Are All Right was nominated for four Oscars including Best Picture, won two Golden Globe Awards and received a 93% positive review rating from Rotten Tomatoes out of 205 reviews. In 2003, he joined Intellectual Properties Worldwide, where he executive produced Piranha 3D and a remake of It's Alive. The horror film Piranha 3D was produced for $24 million and earned over $83 million worldwide. On the New York stage, Todd produced Heathers: The Musical (musical), Doctor Zhivago (musical) and American Psycho (musical). In 2014, he funded Branded Pictures Entertainment, an acquisitions and development company focused in popular and acclaimed intellectual properties including titles such as Danny and the Dinosaur, Rift, and Dance Dance Revolution. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife Amy Powers (married in 1997) and two sons Jasper (born in 1998) and Cole (born in 2000). He has taught producing at Chapman University, the Los Angeles Film School, was an adjunct professor for Syracuse University's Los Angeles campus and has given private seminars around the country.

Kansas would win one game in the Big 12 Tournament before losing to Missouri in the semifinals. Kansas would get off to a slow start in the NCAA Tournament as they barely beat Utah State in the 1st round, but would catch fire during the rest of the NCAA tournament as they romped Arizona State in the 2nd round and would beat Duke and Arizona (avenging a loss from earlier this season) to reach the Final Four and would romp Marquette in the National Semifinals to reach the 2003 National Championship Game. Game Summary Leading up to the championship game, much of the conversation revolved around how, no matter the outcome, one of the well-known head coaches would win their first championship. In Jim Boeheim's 27 years as head coach at Syracuse his team had been to two Final Fours, and finished runner-up each time (1987, 1996). Roy Williams, during his fifteen seasons as Kansas head coach, had reached the Final Four four times, and finished runner up once (1991). Syracuse dominated with a hot shooting first half to lead by 11 at the break. Gerry McNamara connected on an impressive six three-pointers in the half, which were his 18 points for the game. Kansas fought back to within 80-78 in the final minute and had a chance to tie after Hakim Warrick missed a pair of free throws in the final moments. Warrick, however, then blocked Michael Lee's three point attempt with 0.7 seconds remaining on the game clock. After Kirk Hinrich's three-pointer at the buzzer went over the net, Syracuse's victory gave them, and Jim Boeheim, their first ever national championship. Carmelo Anthony was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) with 21 points in the win. Syracuse also avenged a second-round loss to Kansas two years earlier.

He ran the magazine as \\"a symbol of resistance\\" against successive Peruvian dictators and their censors. He won many international honours, including the Maria Moors Cabot Prize (1975), but was twice deported by his own government, and the magazine was shut down at least eight times. The Peruvian Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa called him an \\"indefatigable defender of freedom and democracy\\" who \\"could never be bribed or intimidated\\". Early life and career Enrique Zileri Gibson was born on 4 June 1931 in Lima, Peru. His father was Manlio Zileri Larco Aurelio. His mother, Doris Gibson, cofounded the newsmagazine Caretas with Francisco Igartua in October 1950. In childhood, he suffered from tuberculosis. He studied at Cornell University in the United States, but was forced to drop out when his family ran out of money. He took a job as a publicist, and later traveled in Europe while writing travel articles for Caretas. He described his travel in Europe as a \\"voyage of self-discovery\\". Caretas In the mid-1950s, Zileri joined Caretas full-time after returning to Peru from Europe. By that time the dictator Manuel A. Odria had already briefly shut down the magazine for \\"offending\\" him. In 1962, Francisco Igartua left Caretas to start his own political magazine Hey, which would also achieve wide popularity, and Zileri became a co-director of Caretas with his mother. The two provided in-depth news investigation and sharp opinions which increased the magazine's popularity, but also attracted the wrath of the Peruvian government. Between 1968 and 1979, the government shut down the magazine seven times, for almost two years in one occasion, and for five months in 1979. Zileri called Caretas \\"a symbol of resistance\\" against successive dictators and their censors, and was deported twice, to Portugal and Argentina, respectively. He was also sentenced to prison for three years for defaming government officials, before he was pardoned by an amnesty. Zileri gradually took over responsibilities from his mother, until Doris Gibson fully retired in the early 1990s. During the authoritarian administration of Alberto Fujimori in the 1990s, Zileri took a principled stance against the government, at a time when Fujimori bribed many of Peru's television stations and newspapers. He exposed the past of the powerful spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, and opposed Fujimori's attempt to extend his presidency for an unconstitutional third term. He was hit with a fine in 1992, and the magazine lost revenue due to government pressure on advertisers, but was vindicated when corruption scandals forced Fujimori from office in 2000. Fujimori was eventually convicted for human rights abuses. Awards In 1975, Columbia University awarded Zileri the Maria Moors Cabot Award for \\"excellence in coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean\\". He later became a judge for the award. He also served as the president of the International Press Institute, an organisation dedicated to the promotion and protection of press freedom. Family Zileri was married to Daphne Dougall, an Argentine of Scottish descent and a distinguished photographer, for 51 years. They had five children: Drusila, Diana, Domenica, Sebastian and Marco. Marco Zileri has taken over the leadership role at Caretas after his father's retirement. Retirement and death In the 2000s, Zileri ceded leadership of Caretas to his son Marco. On 25 August 2014, Zileri died in Lima from complications of throat cancer. His death was announced by Prime Minister Ana Jara.

Funded through Kickstarter, production sought $10,000 in funding, but raised $101,000. It had its public debut July 26, 2014 at the San Diego Comic- Con. Set in the Star Trek universe, the film stars Kate Vernon, Tony Todd, Richard Hatch, Gary Graham, and J. G. Hertzler, in a documentary-style film recounting the events surrounding the Battle of Axanar, mentioned without any detail in passing in the original Star Trek series episode Whom Gods Destroy, here depicted as a decisive military engagement between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Production Alec Peters and his original production partner, Co-writer and director Christian Gossett, began work on the film in 2010. Gossett's production company, Metamorfic was brought on board as Peters had no previous production experience. Prior to 2016, the Star Trek rights holders, primarily Paramount Studios, had generally allowed fan- made projects to move forward just \\"as long as they agreed not to sell anything‚Äîincluding tickets, merchandise, or copies of the finished film or series.\\" To circumvent these limitations Peters employed both a Kickstarter and a fan funding campaign which eventually exceeded his initial funding goal of $10,000 by raising $101,000. The film itself was shot in two days, with a third day as a pickup to get plates of Admiral Ramirez' first speech as leader of the Federation of Planets. Cast includes Richard Hatch and J. G. Hertzler in principal roles, with Gary Graham reprising his role as Vulcan ambassador Soval. The filmmaker's stated purpose was to demonstrate that high quality Star Trek films could be made on a low budget. The film's makeup was by Kevin Haney, sound design was by Frank Serafine, and visual effects were the work of Tobias Richter and Tommy Kraft. Plot The film is presented as one episode of a Federation documentary pertaining to a \\"Four Years War\\" with the Klingon Empire, narrated by fictional noted historian John Gill (who appeared in \\"Patterns of Force\\") and featuring interviews of participants on both sides. The events depicted reportedly precede Star Trek: The Original Series by two decades, with the war's opening battle at Arcanis IV, a prosperous Federation colony along the Klingon border. The Klingons, who did not consider the Federation to be a worthy adversary, maintained the initiative for the first six months of the war, with a number of victories under the leadership of their supreme commander, Kharn. The Vulcan diplomatic delegation under Ambassador Soval (who appeared on Star Trek: Enterprise), overseeing negotiations with the Klingons, are left with little room to maneuver. In response to the losses suffered in the war, Starfleet appoints a new Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Marcus Ramirez, who pledges in a fleet-wide broadcast to defend \\"the dream of the Federation\\" against the Klingons' commitment to its destruction. Ramirez oversees the creation of the Ares-class cruisers, Starfleet's first warships, to counter the Klingons' mainstay, the D6 battlecruiser. The introduction of the Ares turns the tide against the Klingons, who begin to give Starfleet its due as a worthy opponent, and particularly take notice of Garth of Izar (who appeared in \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\"), the captain of the prototype USS Ares. To counter the Ares cruisers, the Klingons order the construction of a newer and more advanced battlecruiser, the D7, that would restore the Klingons' technical and military advantage. In response, Starfleet begins developing their own next-generation heavy cruiser, the Constitution-class, but construction falls behind schedule. To gain more time to finish their new heavy cruiser, Starfleet approves a plan proposed by Garth to fight the Klingons at Axanar, the planet where Kharn's spies have reported the Constitution prototypes (revealed to be the Constitution and the Enterprise) are being built. The narrative concludes shortly before the battle at Axanar, when the first three D7s enter the war, leaving the audience to wonder what actually happened in the battle itself.

By way of example, the film's inclusion of Richard Hatch of the original TV series Battlestar Galactica would have the \\"fan-verse\\" of the two series collide in a positive manner. Houston Press called it a functional example of \\"demonstration of concept,\\" and urged Star Trek fans to see the film. They praised the cast, writing \\"actors (Richard Hatch, Tony Todd, etc.) have some serious chops,\\" and noted that the film's visual effects \\"are stunning.\\" Home Media Magazine shared \\"the film‚Äôs high production values, cinema-quality special effects and the involvement of actors from the canonical Star Trek series elevates Prelude to Axanar beyond the status of a mere fan film.\\" Author David Gerrold, writer of The Trouble with Tribbles and contributor to both the original Star Trek series and Star Trek: The Next Generation, after reading the Axanar script for the first time, stated \\"This is Star Trek.\\" Liking the concept, and being so personally familiar with the Star Trek universe, he signed on as creative consultant. Guardian Liberty Voice wrote \\"The acting is superb, including appealing performances from Gary Graham as a Vulcan ambassador, Richard Hatch as the sweet-eyed Klingon General Kharn and the magnetic Kate Vernon as Starfleet Captain Sonya Alexander,\\" and praised the film, writing \\"Prelude to Axanar is of the highest Hollywood-style production quality and a must-see for any devotee of the franchise.\\" Entertainment News International drew the conclusion that \\"Axanar is a ground breaking independent film that proves the idea that a studio doesn't need to spend millions of dollars to produce a feature quality production. Axanar will be the first non-CBS/Paramount produced Star Trek to look and feel like a true Star Trek movie.\\" =Awards= \\"Prelude to Axanar\\" won six of nine categories in the 2015 Independent Star Trek Fan Film Awards (Best Production Design; Best Visual Effects; Best Soundtrack; Best Original Story or Screenplay; Best Director; and Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form), presented at and by Treklanta.\\"The 2015 Independent Star Trek Fan Film Awards Winners\\" YouTube, 7/28/2018\\"Independent Star Trek Fan Film Awards Announced\\" TrekToday, 4/27/2015\\"And the winners are: The Star Trek Independent Fan Film Awards\\" TrekMovie, 4/26/2015\\"The Star Trek Independent Fan Film Awards\\" The Trek BBS, 2/9/2015 Release Prelude to Axanar released a three-minute teaser-trailer on June 11, 2014. The completed 21 minute short film had a private red carpet premiere July 26, 2014 at San Diego's Horton Plaza UA Cinema and its public debut screening at the 2014 Comic-Con. Available through the Axanar Productions YouTube page, the Prelude to Axanar film includes subtitles in eight languages: French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Czech and Portuguese, as well as both American and British English.  Raising $638,000 on Kickstarter through the creation and release of Prelude to Axanar, Peters went into pre- production for the feature film Star Trek: Axanar, with production slated to begin in October 2015, for an early 2016 release. The original plan was to raise financing \\"in chunks\\", with the initial Kickstarter to raise enough money to obtain a warehouse, convert it to a sound stage and build sets. Approximately $200,000 of the funding happened in the campaign's final 49 hours, after Star Trek alum George Takei shared his interest publicly, bringing production more than six-times the originally sought amount of $100,000. The cast includes: Richard Hatch as Kharn the Undying (Klingon supreme commander); J. G. Hertzler as Admiral Samuel Travis (Captain of the USS Hercules); Gary Graham as Soval (Vulcan Ambassador to the Federation); and Kate Vernon as Captain Sonya Alexander (Captain of the USS Ajax). On January 3, 2016, Alec Peters announced he would no longer portray Captain Kelvar Garth in the Axanar movie, stating that he wanted to hire a professional actor to fill the role, which would allow him to focus more on writing and producing. In July 2020 a screen shot of actor Gary Graham's social media page showed his announcement that he had left the project. The following month co-writer and director Paul Jenkins announced through his production company that his association with Axanar had ended. Lawsuit On December 29, 2015, CBS and Paramount Pictures filed a copyright lawsuit seeking damages in the US District Court for the Central District of California, stating Axanar works infringe their rights by making use of the Klingon language and \\"innumerable copyrighted elements of Star Trek, including its settings, characters, species, and themes\\". On March 28, 2016, Axanar Productions filed a motion to dismiss or strike Paramount and CBS's claims, saying the elements mentioned in the court filing are not protected by copyright and it is seeking premature relief from a work, the Axanar film, that does not exist.Copyright Does Not Protect the Klingon Language, Court Hears March 30, 2016 On May 9, 2016, the motion to dismiss the lawsuit was denied. Later that month, J. J. Abrams said that \\"within the next few weeks, it will be announced this is going away\\". Abrams said he pushed the studio to stop the lawsuit, because \\"we realized this is not the appropriate way to deal with the fans.\\" This statement by Abrams had no apparent effect on the lawsuit, since the case was scheduled for a jury trial in early 2017. On June 23, 2016, Paramount and CBS released new fan film guidelines, which Axanar staff described as \\"disheartening\\" and \\"draconian.\\" Alec Peters had several times suggested that the rights holders should issue guidelines to fanfilm makers, even going so far as proposing some prior to the CBS official guidelines release, a number of which were similar to those finally imposed. However, Alec Peters started talking about these guidelines only after the lawsuit and after it became known that CBS were going to set their guidelines - Peters was trying to influence the final form of the CBS guidelines; the discussion about the proposal to CBS was happening in a private Facebook group; and it was agreed that the proposal to CBS will not include crowdfunding ban, while this ban is a crucial part of CBS guidelines. CBS cited crowdfunding as the reason for new and more strict Star Trek fan film guidelines. On January 5, 2017, U.S. District Court judge R. Gary Klausner rejected various motions by both parties, setting the stage for a civil trial on the matter to go forward on January 31. On January 20, 2017, the parties announced that the lawsuit had been settled, with Alec Peters and Axanar Productions promising to make \\"substantial changes\\" to Axanar and agreeing to abide by Paramount's and CBS' \\"Guidelines for Fan Films.\\" Under the terms of the settlement, the filmmakers will be allowed to release two 15-minute movies, instead of their planned 90-minute feature. The films cannot be shown with ads.

The lava field was created by fissure eruptions. After a research expedition in 1880, the lava field was initially called Kvislarhraun. Four years later, it received its current name by the geologist and geographer, √ûorvaldur Thoroddsen. Holuhraun is the site of a volcanic eruption which began on 29 August 2014 and produced a lava field of more than and ‚Äì the largest in Iceland since 1783. Geography Holuhraun is situated at the southern end of √ìd√°√∞ahraun, which is one of the largest lava fields in the country. The main volume of the J√∂kuls√° √° Fj√∂llum river flows from the eastern side of Holuhraun, in the Kverkfj√∂ll area. Hrimalda, Ur√∞arh√°ls and Kistufell are to the west of Holuhraun, with Dyngjuh√°ls and Tr√∂lladyngja beyond. The Dyngjuj√∂kull glacier, which is part of Vatnaj√∂kull, is to the immediate south. Holuhraun is about south of the Askja caldera, and the B√°r√∞arbunga volcano is to the south-west of Holuhraun. Holuhraun is traversed by an unnumbered road, which connects to the Route F910 gravel road at both the east and the west ends. Volcanism Located at the northern and southern extensions of the B√°r√∞arbunga and Askja fissure systems, respectively, the soil is mainly composed of lavas derived from these volcanoes, either in the form of flows or alluvial deposits of volcanic origin. The geological configuration, along with the presence of nearby subglacial volcanoes such as B√°r√∞arbunga and Gr√≠msv√∂tn, is responsible for the risk of j√∂kulhlaups, which have affected Holuhraun repeatedly. The eruption in Holuhraun on 4 September 2014 Lava fountains of the fissure eruption in Holuhraun on 13 September 2014 around 21:20. Until 2014, the surface of the lava field was of an older lava flow, which had erupted from a vent associated with Askja in 1797. In the early hours of 29 August 2014, a small fissure eruption occurred in Holuhraun at the northern end of a magma intrusion which had moved progressively north, since 16 August, from the B√°r√∞arbunga volcano. The progression of the magma intrusion was accompanied by an earthquake swarm. The eruption began just after midnight and stopped at 04:00 GMT. The active fissure was about in length. Another fissure eruption started in Holuhraun at around 05:05 GMT on the morning of 31 August 2014, in the same rift as the eruption which had occurred two days earlier. The eruptive fissure was estimated to be long. By 4 September, the total area of the lava flow was estimated at . Two new eruptive fissures formed south of the main eruption site, on 5 September. The new fissures were substantially smaller than the older fissure. By 7 September, the lava flow had extended to the north, and had reached the main western branch of the J√∂kuls√° √° Fj√∂llum river. The eruption showed no visible activity in the southern fissure, on the evening of 7 September. The lava flow is considered to be the largest in recent decades in Iceland and covered on 29 September. The volcanic eruption in Holuhraun continued with similar intensity as the previous few weeks. The lava field covered in late October. On 11 November, it was reported that the lava field extended to and more than in volume - the largest in Iceland since the Laki eruption of 1783. The eruption ended on 27 February 2015. The Holuhraun lava field measures more than and the volume is around . Several names were proposed for the new lava field in the Holuhraun area, among them Fl√¶√∞ahraun, Nornahraun, and Ur√∞arbruni. Finally, the decision was to keep the existing name Holuhraun.

It will be used in search and rescue operations where it would be too dangerous or inaccessible for a helicopter, such as evacuating people from the upper stories of burning buildings, or delivering and extracting police and soldiers while very close to structures, narrow streets, and or through holes into confined spaces. Background After the 2006 Lebanon War, the IDF realized that it needed a special vehicle that could fly unmanned behind enemy lines in order to rescue its wounded. While the helicopter is the best evacuation vehicle, it requires an area clear of trees or electricity columns in order to land without obstructing the rotor. Chances of it safely leaving a fire-heavy zone are small as it attracts all sorts of weapons fire. The advantages of a ducted fan propelled unmanned air vehicle are that it could offer the same capabilities as helicopters, but without the serious operating limitations. It could navigate in and out of creeks, city streets, next to big buildings, compact alleyways and refugee camp warrens, while the shielded rotor blades make the AirMule tougher than a regular helicopter. Being unmanned, the AirMule could enter situations too risky for regular helicopters. It could deliver supplies or cargo, evacuate up to two casualties from the battlefield and transferring them to a field deployed hospital for medical treatment. Some missions may require to be conducted up to hundreds of kilometers from forward operating bases (FOB) and medical care facilities with the only medical support available on scene being unit medics or fellow soldiers. The war reports have shown that moving an individual only a few hundred yards can take an hour or more. As of 2012 and into 2014, according to NATO STO TR-HFM-184 report, the AirMule remains the only available design that meets NATO and IDF requirement for an unmanned MEDEVAC and CASEVAC vehicle. Urban Aeronautics Ltd. has patented its design as Fancraft. Urban Aeronautics The Fancraft technologies are supported by 37 registered (granted) patents and 12 additional are in the process. Tactical Robotics Ltd. (TRL), as a subsidiary of Urban Aeronautics Ltd. has an exclusive license for use predominantly in the unmanned military and homeland security markets. TRL has taken the lead in the development of the AirMule. Metro Skyways Ltd. (MSL), as a subsidiary of Urban Aeronautics Ltd. has an exclusive license for use predominantly in the manned civil Air-Taxi as well as Air-Rescue and MedEvac markets. MSL has taken the lead in the development of the X-Hawk. On May 29, 2018, the Cormorant completed its first live demo. Development In 2004, the X-Hawk LE concept was published by Urban Aeronautics. In June 2008, a scaled-down technology demonstrator Panda flew for the first time. It was built to demonstrate its new flight control system and to attract partners. Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries and Urban Aeronautics joined in the X-Hawk project headed by the non-profit Aerospace Medicine Research Center (Fisher institute for air and space strategic studies). The initial idea for the UAS were civilian in nature, but after the publication of plans to equip the US marines with UAVs capable of transporting humans, it was decided to concentrate on the military arena. In 2008, Urban Aeronautics released its initial concept art. On January 7, 2009, a cargo variant that will be able to fly at speeds of 200 to began wind tunnel testing. In 2009, the Mule model was shown at the Israeli pavilionat at the 48th Paris Air Show. Its maiden flight was scheduled for April 2009, but was postponed. In June 2009, the UAV was shipped to a flight- testing facility located in central Israel where its Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 engine performed a series of ground tests for hover testing. Phase 1: hover control system Around January 12, 2010, the renamed AirMule had its (tethered) maiden flight and achieved only an altitude of 2 feet. In 30 tethered tests of 1 min duration, it completed the first phase of testing and it demonstrated the fly-by-wire control system‚Äôs ability to stabilize the vehicle in all three axes using inertial measurements augmented by GPS and two laser altimeters. The next phase of flight testing planned for March was moved back. On April 21, 2010, it achieved sustained tethered automatic hovering flight at an altitude of up to 9.8 ft (3m), which paved the way for the first untethered flight later that year. After 40 test hovers and 10 hours of flight time, the AirMule underwent systems upgrades. By October 5, 2010, the AirMule's skid were replaced by a wheeled landing gear to facilitate ground manoeuvring and to enable short take-off (STOL) and vertical landing operations (VTOL). First considerations were given to countermeasures. Phase 2: free hovering and low- speed flight manoeuvres Flight testing resumed until January 2011 when the AirMule underwent systems and structural upgrades which were completed by May 9, 2011. It was fitted with an expanded suite of sensors, and a new energy- absorbing wheeled landing gear. The aerodynamics if the lower fuselage was improved for better control responses in gusty wind conditions. On June 30, 2011, it was revealed that a variant the AirMule will be equipped with a remotely operated robotic arm to undertake tasks that pose a danger to humans. This was in response to requests by operators of power line maintenance, and by agencies responsible for the safety of nuclear reactors. By August 2011, the AirMule had accumulated approximately 40 flying hours. The Defense Ministry is financing half the operational technologies. In September, 2011, the IDF had identified an operational requirement for an unmanned VTOL platform that will be used to perform resupply and medical evacuation tasks from the front line. The IDF started to allocate a budget for the requirement in the long term acquisition plan. The defence ministry will participate in the funding. Around October 31, 2011, construction on a second AirMule prototype has started. It will receive a double redundant hydraulic system and stealth features. Phase 3: full flight envelope testing On April 23, 2012, it was revealed that a Controp D-Stamp stabilized electro-optical airborne sensor was installed on the first prototype. On January 21, 2013, it was revealed that the first prototype will receive new propeller blades for the new six- bladed rotors. These will replace the four-bladed rotors that have been used since the beginning of 2010. The change will increase payload capacity by approximately 200 kg (440 lb). The blades comply with the loads specified for the US Federal Aviation Administration's FAR 35 standard for propellers. The first test flight was scheduled for mid-February. On February 26, 2013, plans for a high-speed AirMule version was revealed to be the previously tested cargo variant. It will be used for tactical resupply missions. On February 25, 2014, it was announced that Green Hills Software real-time operating system (RTOS) had been chosen by Urban Aeronautics. Design The design, Fancraft, was inspired by the Piasecki VZ-8 Airgeep's revolutionary design with two tandem ducted fans. However, that's where the similarities end. Forward thrust is primarily provided by two ducted fans thrusters located at the sides of the aft section. The lift fan and thrusters are powered by a single turboshaft turbine through three proprietary gearboxes and shafts. The early prototype was powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 which was later replaced a Turbomeca Arriel 2. Originally the prototype lift fans had four-blade rotors, but the final fans have six-blade rotors with staggered-rotors for a speed variant. The fuselage is constructed from carbon (fiber)-composite. Two 770 liters air- conditioned cells on its sides are designed to receive stretchers and casualties. The cells will also have devices for transfusions during flight. Initial interior cabin noise was measured in hover at 95 decibels without any incorporated acoustic treatment or liners. An additional 1,100 liters are available in an optional belly mounted compartment. The fuselage forms an airfoil and generates over 50% of lift at high speed (US Patent # 7,806,362B2). An aerodynamic bulge between the ducted fans keeps the airflow attached to it, hence generating lift, while diverting the airflow into the aft fan for increased thrust. For military purposes the AirMule can be equipped with flare and chaff countermeasures. Since the second prototype, the AirMule has improved stealth. The fuselage structure and design of the engine‚Äôs exhaust pipe reduce its noise, heat, and radar signatures, including an appropriate flight profile. Early tests without stealth measured 87 decibels during hover at a distance of 125 feet. The Trophy system was considered for inclusion. =Flight stability, forward speed and safety= For increasing or decreasing overall lift, the angle of attack for all blades is collectively altered by equal amounts at the same time resulting in ascents, descents. The Fancraft technology on the AirMule employs a Vane Control System (VCS)(US Patents #6,464,166 and 6,817,570) consisting of 200 vanes at the inlet and outlet ducts that can be deflected simultaneously (top and bottom) or differentially to generate side force or a rolling movement. Front and rear ducts are deflected differentially for yaw. The VCS generates six degrees of freedom independent of one another. The VCS is powered by a dual redundant hydraulic system which will allow for uninterrupted rotor pitch control in the event of a failure to one of the pressure supply lines. The VCS is engaged in excess of 100 per second. The early VCS was generating more than 2.0 radians/sec¬≤ of roll acceleration for roll and yaw control. It was planned to double roll acceleration with planned improvements, enabling precise hovering in gusty wind conditions with wind speeds of up to 50 kn (92.5 km/h). A set of louvers at the front of the forward duct and rear of the aft duct that open during forward flight to allow the incoming flow to move through the duct and thereby greatly reduce drag to enable forward speeds of 100‚Äì120 knots in contrast to a top speed of typically 40 knots in a conventional ducted-fan design (US Patent # 7,806,362B2). Due to the absence of a rotor, hence autorotation, Fancraft will be equipped with a ballistically deployed parachute to be used in cases of catastrophic engine failure. =Sensors and radars= The AirMule is equipped with GPS for translational position and velocity readings, two laser altimeters to indicate the vehicle‚Äôs height above ground which will be augmented by a doppler radar altimeter for dusty conditions. A Controp D-Stamp stabilized electro-optical sensor provides as part of the auto-land system will enable the aircraft to guide itself to land over any high contrast marker (flare, flag, a red cloth) in a combat zone. If a landing site cannot be highlighted by placing a physical marker, a laser spot from an airborne designator could be used. =Avionics= The flight- control system is a four-channel redundant fly-by-wire system that relies almost entirely on inertial measurements augmented by GPS signals. The AirMule uses the Integrity real-time operating system (RTOS) and Multi integrated development environment (IDE) for custom programming. =Ground control, telemetry and navigation= Sensors and other subsystems use three datalinks providing 460 channels of real-time telemetry. The retrieved and transferred data will be stored at a ground control unit (GCU), which will be equipped with an air data computer for displaying its position. The GCU will monitor telemetry data supplied by the UAV using uplink and downlink communication devices. Pilots will use a fly-by-wire flight control system, as well as an automatic stabilization feature to help control the aircraft and maintain level flight. The AirMule can land safely despite communication errors in the GCS. Certification FAA certification has been a prime consideration in every aspect of Fancraft. Fancraft is being designed in compliance with the FAA's FAR Part 27 and Part 29 (depending on weight) certification standards. They also comply with the special 'Powered Lift‚Äô certification standard that was developed for Tilt-Rotor aircraft. Scenario A single AirMule is capable of ferrying 500 kilograms (1102 lbs.) of useful cargo per each 50-kilometer (31 statute miles) radius sortie, thereby delivering approximately 6,000 kilograms (13227 lbs.) over 24 hours. A 10‚Äì12 AirMule \\"Mobile Supply Unit\\" can deliver supplies, day after day, to sustain 3,000 combatants, while at the same time ferrying back their wounded and casualties. Equipped with remotely controlled manipulator arms it can be used for inspections, maintenance operations or repairs, flying above dangerous zones such as nuclear reactors and areas contaminated by chemical plant leaks. Examples could include replacing damaged insulators on power lines, pumping heavy water into pools covering uranium rods inside damaged nuclear reactors, fixing leaking pipes or repairing areas under bridges or marine structures that have suffered corrosion damage, and agricultural spraying. Variants * high-speed AirMule for tactical supply mission, staggered-rotors, 250 kn, fuselage design with spoiler to increase use of airflow for more thrust. The variant will be powered by a 1,600 shp (1,190 kW)class turbine engine, and is 20% larger and 50% heavier than the standard AirMule.

It was built in 1748 for a wealthy Worstead weaver called Andrew Chamber.  Description  The hall is rectangle in plan and is built over three storeys and is situated in the centre of the north end of the small estate. The south-facing fa√ßade has five bays with a pediment over the three central bays. Carved in stone set into the brick faced pediment is a coat of arms with garlands. The front main entrance has Ionic columns topped with a pediment protruding from the front triple-bay building line, the roof is clad in black glazed Norfolk pantiles. The west-facing fa√ßade has a latter addition of a full-height bowed extension with windows which overlook the gardens on this side of the hall. This extension is attributed to the architect John Soane and was part of the alterations carried out under his instruction in 1788 and completed in 1790. Around the building at the first floor Humphry Repton added a platband embellishment in his alterations of 1792. In 1868 a new service wing was added to the north elevation under the instruction of architect Richard Phipson. He also moved the original 1748 staircase into the new wing. = Other estate buildings = 130 metres to the north of the hall is the coach house and stable block which is also Grade II listed. The stable is a single-storey Norfolk red brick built building with a pantile roof and has a U-shaped plan. In the centre of the building there is a crow-stepped gable above which there is a clock tower topped with a cupola. Below this is an archway. = Walled garden = 150 metres south west of the house there is a three-sided walled garden with the south elevation open. Each of the three walls have a gothic arched entrance through. The originally there were lean-to greenhouses along the north wall but these have been demolished. It is believed that it was Repton who had the south wall removed as part of his instruction to shorten the depth of the enclosed garden to open up the view of his landscape scheme when viewed from the hall. = Park and gardens = The landscaped gardens around Honing Hall were designed by Humphry Repton in 1792. He produced one of his striking red book of designs showing his ideas before and after. Much of the design work from the book was taken up. The grounds take up 35 hectares most of which is to the south of the hall. Much of the boundary is planted with small plantations of trees with open space in the middle which has scattered clumps of oak trees.  History  The present hall stands on land which was once occupied by a much earlier settlement or house which stood a short distance from where the stable block is. The remnants of this house were thought to have been finally removed just before the construction of the hall in 1748. This previous dwelling itself had replaced an earlier enclosed medieval moated dwelling which stood just inside the northern boundary of the property. This area is now an overgrown plantation but vestiges of three arms of the moat can be found and still retain water. In the centre is a raised area where once stood the medieval building. In the 1740s the property had been purchased by Andrew Chamber who was a prosperous Norwich, Worsted weaver. He wanted to build a country house for his family and it was completed in 1748 by an unknown architect and builder. It appears that at some time Chamber got into financial difficulties and as a consequence sold the house and property to Thomas Cubitt in 1784. He was a Captain in the East Norfolk Militia. His son also called Thomas inherited the hall and following his marriage in 1784 moved into the hall. It was Thomas Henry Cubitt who instructed the prominent architect John Soane to prepare plans for alterations to the Hall. Some of Soane's recommendation were taken up by Cubitt in particular the full-height semicircular bowed extension on the west fa√ßade. In 1792 the Landscape designer and architect Humphry Repton was commissioned by Thomas to re-design the grounds. He was also responsible for work on the house including alteration to the aesthetics of the exterior of the house. In the Gazetteer and Directory of Norfolk 1836 the owner of the house and lord of the manor was Edward Cubitt, Esq. The house and estate are still owned by the Cubitt Family. = The Cubitt family = The Cubitts of Honing have a distinguished history of serving their country in the military. As already mentioned, the first owner, Thomas Cubitt was a captain in the East Norfolk Militia; he was also a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant of the county of Norfolk. Edward George Cubitt (1795 ‚Äì 1865) served with the 4th Dragoons in the Peninsular War where he was at the Burgos and was decorated for actions at Battle of Vitoria, Pamplona and Battle of Toulouse (1814). There is a tablet dedicated to Edward's memory in the parish church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the village of Honing.  First World War The family's military service continued in the First World War. The 5th Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment included some men employed by the Royal Family on the Sandringham Estate in the north-west of Norfolk. The officer commanding was Colonel Sir Horace Beauchamp C.B. and amongst his officers were three sons of Edward G. Cubitt and his wife Christabel of Honing Hall: Captain Edward Randall Cubitt, Lieutenant Victor Murray Cubitt and Captain Eustace Henry Cubitt. Also in the battalion was the Cubitt's cousin, Second Lieutenant Randall Burroughes. On 29 July 1915 the brothers along with their cousin as part of the 5th Battalion boarded the RMS Aquitania in Liverpool bound for the Dardanelles. On 12 August 1915 the battalion went into action on the battlefield of Suvla. Colonel Beauchamp, 17 of his officers, which included the Cubitt brothers and their cousin and 250 men advanced toward the enemy and suffered heavy losses. A myth grew up around the battalion long after the War that they had advanced into a mist and simply disappeared. According to accounts of 50 years later, three observers from the New Zealand Army claimed that on an almost cloudless, breezy day, a loaf-shaped cloud stayed stationary over Hill 60 partly obscuring it. They watched the battalion march into the cloud. The observers waited for almost an hour, and then the mist seemed to rise, almost vertically, and joined the rest of the clouds in the sky. The soldiers who entered were gone, leaving no trace of their presence. However, the truth is more prosaic. The 5 battalion that took Hill 60 did not vanish into a cloud, but went on to attack the Turkish positions in the woods beyond Hill 60. They were cut off, and those that were not killed died later as prisoners of war. The fate of the soldiers was ascertained in 1919, when the Graves Registration Unit searched the battle site. The remains of 115 men of the battalion were found and buried in Azmak Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. Captain Edward Randall Cubitt, Lieutenant Victor Murray Cubitt and Second Lieutenant Randall Burroughes were all killed in action. Victor and Edward have no known grave and are commemorated on the Helles Memorial near Sedd el Bahr, Turkey and on the parish church war memorial in Honing. Captain Eustace Henry Cubitt survived the attack of the 12 August but was killed in action on 19 April 1917 and his grave is in Gaza War Cemetery. A BBC TV drama, All the King's Men (1999), starring David Jason as Captain Frank Beck, was based upon the story.

After gathering public support to successfully defeat those proposals The Friends of Quantock subsequently campaigned for proper management and protection of the Hills leading to the Quantocks becoming an AONB in 1956 and to the setting up of the Quantock Hills Joint Advisory Committee in 1973. They opposed plans to build an 18 hole Golf Course on top of the hills in the 1970s. In 2013 they acquired two tracts of land from Somerset County Council and were incorporated as a CIO.  Activities  Over the years Friends of Quantock has commissioned reports and surveys of Quantock plants and wildlife, made grants for restoration projects of landscape features, published books and leaflets, commented on planning applications and served on the Joint Advisory Committee. They have campaigned over litter, vehicle use, deer poaching, quarries, overhead power lines, and public rights of way.  Land acquisition  Pony on QuantocksIn 2012 Somerset County Council declared their land holdings on the Quantocks to be 'Surplus' and announced their intention to sell them. Friends of Quantock opposed in principle the transfer of Quantock land out of public ownership but was successful in negotiating the acquisition of of heathland and forest under a Community Asset Transfer Scheme for the sum of ¬£2. Over Stowey Customs Common and Thorncombe Hill are therefore owned and held by Friends of Quantock for the benefit of the public. As a result of this purchase the Charity was dissolved and reincorporated as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation to protect its trustees from the liabilities of property ownership.

It first aired on October 24, 2012, on the NBC network in the United States. The episode's plot focuses on the kidnapping of a young boy from the subway in Morningside Heights. Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) realise the case echoes a similar kidnapping in the same neighborhood 13 years prior. As the SVU squad try to find the missing child, they also try to solve the earlier case and learn from their mistakes. The episode was written by Peter Blauner and directed by Jean de Segonzac. The story was conceived in July 2011, but it was not intended to be the 300th episode until late in its development, when Dick Wolf noticed that it contained qualities that made up the main show. Showrunner Warren Leight wanted \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" to have various references to the show's first episode, \\"Payback\\", and several actors from the pilot made appearances in \\"Manhattan Vigil\\". Filming for the episode began on September 17, 2012. de Segonzac merged footage from the show's first season into the episode, to portray the detective's flashbacks to the previous case, which did not occur previously in the series. \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" was seen by 6.77 million viewers, making it the most watched program on NBC that night and the third most watched program in its timeslot. Critical response was mostly positive, with one critic calling it \\"a gut-wrenching story\\", while another said the opening scene gave him \\"goosebumps\\". However, Kristen Elizabeth from TV Equals did not think it was interesting enough and said previous episodes contained better interrogation scenes. Several critics chose the episode as their highlight or show of the week. The storyline was revisited in the season 17 episode \\"Depravity Standard\\" on November 18, 2015. Plot In 1999, Dolores Rodriguez (Liza Col√≥n-Zayas) puts up posters for her missing son, Hector. The following year, Dolores prays for her son by his wall, while David (Hamish Linklater) and Laurie Morris (Mili Avital), pass by with their newborn. In the present day, a newly divorced David collects his son Wyatt (Luke Fava) on the way to a baseball game. While they are in the subway, a man in a red baseball cap points out that David has dropped a $20 bill and when David picks it up, the man grabs Wyatt and takes him onto the train. After the train leaves, David goes up to the street to call 911. Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) arrive on scene and Benson recognises the neighborhood and remembers Hector Rodriguez's disappearance. After receiving conflicting eyewitness statements, the detectives initially suspect Laurie or David, as they are in a custody battle. David later reveals that he and Wyatt went to a caf√©, and the waitress (Madison McKinley) remembers seeing a man that matches the suspect. Detectives Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish), Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) and John Munch (Richard Belzer) question a shopkeeper (Ramsey Faragallah) who saw Wyatt with a man in a red baseball cap. The man bought hair dye and Munch recognises the M.O. is the same as Hector's kidnapper. The detectives start to believe that Wyatt and Hector's cases are linked. Benson and Amaro speak with Hector's mother and learn that she received a letter from police officer Steve Lomatin (Alex Karpovsky), who found Hector's lunchbox. When Lomatin later finds Wyatt's baseball cap, he is brought in for questioning. Lomatin shows Rollins and Fin his archive, explaining that there is a connection between the disappearance of young boys and fires in their neighborhood shortly after. Lomatin believes that the kidnapper is placing the bodies of the boys in old buildings and then setting them on fire to hide the evidence. Rollins finds that there were no fires after Hector disappeared, but a nearby building had its basement floor concreted after a flood. Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek) gives the order to dig up the floor and Hector's body is found. Upon learning that his father owns the building that Hector's body was found in, David helps the detectives locate the building manager, Lewis Hoda (Tom Sizemore), who he is in a dispute with. The detectives bring Lewis in for questioning. He admits to setting the building fires and Amaro eventually gets him to confess to kidnapping Wyatt. Benson retrieves Wyatt from a warehouse and he is reunited with his parents. Benson later comforts Delores at Hector's wall mural. Production =Conception= Jean de Segonzac directed both \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" and the show's 1999 pilot episode. A 2006 short story written by Peter Blauner called Going, Going, Gone served as inspiration for the episode. It was not initially intended to be the 300th episode until late in its development. The show's creator, Dick Wolf, explained that as the story developed, it started to contain qualities that make up the main show and it became the 300th \\"because it was an opportunity to do some things creatively that the show has never done before, which is using the lifespan of the show as a story point in a landmark episode.\\" The series' showrunner Warren Leight wanted \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" to have references to the show's pilot episode, which was broadcast on September 20, 1999. While previous milestone episodes have been marked with celebrity guest stars, Leight said the 300th would focus on Detectives Donald Cragen (Florek), John Munch (Belzer) and Olivia Benson (Hargitay). As they were still around after 13 years, Leight decided they should have more to do. The episode also contains flashbacks to the show's first season. The plot centers on present and past missing child cases. When a seven-year-old boy is kidnapped on the subway during the present day, it echoes a similar case involving a boy from the same location. Leight teased, \\"Munch and Benson remember that case and see parallels. It's a question of maybe some incomplete police work from the past coming back 13 years later.\\" =Filming= Filming for the episode began on September 17, 2012. \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" was directed by Jean de Segonzac, who had previously directed 18 other Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episodes, including the show's pilot. de Segonzac called the script \\"very, very heartfelt\\" and wanted the opening vignette to have a \\"breathless quality\\" about it. Ann Farmer from the Directors Guild of America observed that de Segonzac's opening also had a sense of trepidation and the director told her that was the intention. He continued, \\"My job is to translate the written scenes into vivid, real moments, keeping up the momentum and the urgency without losing the story's thread.\\" When Benson experiences flashbacks to the kidnapping case 13 years earlier, de Segonzac opted against using make-up and clothing to make Hargitay look younger. Instead, he decided to use an experimental technique of merging the episode's scenes with footage from the show's first season to make it seem like Benson was having flashbacks to the case, which did not occur in the series. The director hoped that people would not notice the scenes were filmed in different areas of New York. =Casting= On September 19, it was announced that actors Tom Sizemore, Hamish Linklater and Alex Karpovsky would appear in the episode. Leight explained that Linklater would play a successful businessman, whose son is taken, while Karpovsky was cast as a police officer and Sizemore as an employee of Linklater's character's family. Actors Mili Avital and Gordana Rashovich, who appeared in the pilot episode, made guest appearances in \\"Manhattan Vigil\\". Leight described their appearances as \\"a fun Easter egg\\" for viewers. Chris Orbach, the son of Law & Order actor Jerry Orbach, reprised his role as Detective Ken Briscoe from the first season. However, Orbach's scenes were later cut from the episode and Wolf commented, \\"it has nothing to do with anything other than the needs of a constantly shrinking format.\\" Journalist and Today Show correspondent Jenna Wolfe also made a cameo appearance as herself in the episode. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" was viewed by 6.77 million viewers and acquired a 1.9 rating/5% share in the age 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode was the most watched program on NBC that night and the third most watched program in its time slot, behind ABC's Modern Family and CBS's Criminal Minds. In Australia, the episode attracted 681,000 viewers, making it the most watched Network Ten program and the 15th most watched show overall on November 1, 2012. \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" was watched by 199,000 viewers, when it aired on UK channel Universal. It was the most watched show on the channel for the week ending 11 November 2012. =Critical response= Former sex crimes prosecutor Allison Leotta, writing for The Huffington Post, gave the episode a B+. She branded the episode \\"a gut-wrenching story\\" and observed that it \\"showcased the dramatic chops that have made Law and Order: Special Victims Unit a television staple for the last 14 years. I teared up ‚Äì twice.\\" However, Leotta chastised the show for cutting \\"legal corners\\" in regards to Hoda, who she called \\"an unlikely revenge kidnapper\\", and thought that the story about him kidnapping Wyatt out of revenge was \\"far-fetched\\". TV Guide's Matt Roush gave the episode a positive review, saying it was \\"less sordid than the SVU norm\\" and that it benefited from \\"a tangible understanding of life in this city and how a community (and police department) can be haunted for years by a senseless crime.\\" Adam Buckman, writing for the Xfinity website, thought the opening scene \\"was almost too scary to watch, particularly if you live in New York and have first-hand experience with the chaos of crowded, tumultuous subway station platforms.\\" Buckman said Wyatt's kidnap and David's reaction gave him \\"goosebumps\\". Kristen Elizabeth from TV Equals enjoyed the flashbacks, believing that they gave the episode \\"a nostalgic quality it wouldn't have had otherwise\\". However, she wished the episode was more interesting, as it left her confused which \\"soured everything else\\". Elizabeth was glad that Lomatin was not the kidnapper, as she thought it would have been a cliche, and added that she had seen better interrogation scenes in previous episodes. The Los Angeles Times's Ed Stockly chose \\"Manhattan Vigil\\" as one of his \\"TV Highlights,\\" while Alison Willmore from IndieWire thought the episode was worth a look. Andrew Murfett from The Sydney Morning Herald named it \\"show of the week\\" when it was broadcast in Australia. A reporter for the Belfast Telegraph included the episode in their TV Choice feature and commented, \\"not many TV shows can claim they've reached a 300th episode, but Law & Order: SVU can claim that, in style, as a familiar situation arises.\\"  Chronology  The episode was revisited three years later in the season 17 episode \\"Depravity Standard\\", broadcast on November 18, 2015. The plot focuses on Lewis Hodda's trial and the return of psychiatrist George Huang (B. D. Wong), who has been called to testify for the defense.

The majority of the company's employees and business activities are located in the UK.  History  Ballymore Group was founded in 1982 by Sean Mulryan, who is the chairman and the chief executive (CEO). Ballymore Group's UK managing director is John Mulryan, who is a son of the founder. Ballymore are seen as one of the Irish property companies who managed to do well despite the recession. In 2016, their UK profits were recorded at ‚Ç¨217m. It was reported in the Irish Independent that these were \\"exceptional gains\\" and had resulted in almost a threefold profit increase. In 2016, the firm won Large Developer of the Year at the RESI Awards and also won Property Developer of the Year at the Evening Standard Awards.  Developments  Ballymore projects include Pan Peninsula, New Providence Wharf, Wardian London and Embassy Gardens, Nine Elms, which are all well known developments in London. Several of the developments have impressive features. Embassy Gardens Nine Elms saw a ‚Äúworld first‚Äù with a sky pool that was suspended 10-storeys high between two apartment blocks, allowing residents to swim between the buildings. The pool is designed to appear as though it floats in the air and uses 20 cm-thick glass so that swimmers have uninterrupted views of London, including the London Eye and the Palace of Westminster. The 2,000-home complex is near Battersea Power Station and positioned alongside the new US Embassy. At the time of its launch, former Mayor of London Boris Johnson described the Embassy Gardens project as ‚Äúpossibly the most important regeneration story in London and in the UK over the next 20 years‚Äù [10]. In 2018, the Embassy of the United States, London relocated from Grosvenor Square to Embassy Gardens. The land on which the new embassy stands was sold to the US government by the Ballymore Group after a deal was reached in 2008 [10]. As well as the US embassy, the Netherlands relocated their embassy to the area. Publisher Penguin Random House also announced in 2018 it had signed an agreement to take a lease for One Embassy Gardens. New Providence Wharf changed the skyline east of Canary Wharf. Meanwhile, Wardian London features more than 100 different species of exotic plants and its own indoor and outdoor landscaping service. The development features more than 100 different species of exotic plants and its own indoor and outdoor landscaping service. The two towers, 55 and 50 storeys, boldly remake the skyline of Canary Wharf, with all of the 764 apartments featuring balconies and private gardens. Wardian London is due to open in 2020. Ballymore is also responsible for a multi-million pound Canning Town development called City Island. English soprano Laura Wright sang at the launch event in November 2016. The 12-acre island site will be home to the London Film School and the English National Ballet, with 1,000 new homes as well as shops and restaurants. The development has been inspired by Manhattan and is expected to become a cultural hub. In 2019, English National Ballet will move from its 40-year-old home at Markova House in South Kensington into a new 8,600 sq. m facility, four times the size of its existing home. There will be a 300-seat theatre space, dedicated education spaces, rehearsal studios and rehabilitation facilities. The development was considered one of London's most ambitious regeneration projects and it won the top prize at the 2017 London Evening Standard New Homes Awards. It was given the Grand Prix award and trophy for best regeneration project at the ceremony, which took place in The Dorchester hotel. Ballymore is involved with the regeneration of The Royal Docks, which is seeing ¬£6billion of private sector investment. It is building Royal Wharf between the river and Silvertown Way, which will have a 550-yard river frontage and include over 3000 homes, two parts and a new school. In April 2017, Investec demonstrated their support for Ballymore's development at Silvertown by providing a loan of ¬£18m. In January 2019, it was reported that construction work has started on a new riverboat terminal, Royal Wharf Pier. This will allow Thames Clippers to provide a service to the more than 10,000 residents who will live in the 3,385 riverside properties being built by Ballymore in the Royal Docks regeneration area. Royal Wharf has been plagued by problems, with many doors at the development consistently broken, leading to protests from residents at the development. In May 2017 it was announced that the group was working in partnership with the Hong Kong Chinese Kwok Family, who are controlling shareholders in Sun Huang Kai Properties. The partnership involves a project in London, close to the Thames that is the largest Hong Kong investment since the UK decided to leave the EU. In October 2018, it was reported that this joint venture would deliver a ¬£1bn skyscraper scheme in the Isle of Dogs in London's docklands. The Millharbour Quarter will comprise a total of 1,513 homes at Millwall Dock. EcoWorld Ballymore became the first developer in London to encourage buyers by offering to make a charity donation following purchase rather than giving other benefits. During June 2017, the developer committed to giving ¬£10,000 to the JDRF charity, which funds research into Type 1 diabetes, for every home sold in the Embassy Gardens and Nine Elms developments. Theresa May is a patron of the charity. In 2016, it was reported that Ballymore would launch a ‚Ç¨700 million development in Dublin's docklands. The Dublin Landings waterfront regeneration project includes 100,000 sq. m (1,076,391 sq. ft) of office, residential and retail/leisure accommodation, of which 22,019 sq. m (237,000 sq. ft) will be residential accommodation. Upon completion, Ballymore's Dublin Landings Residential' will comprise approximately 268 residential units and will include numerous on-site resident amenities including a concierge service, landscaped gardens, a private gym, business lounges and 210 basement parking spaces. In 2019, it was reported that Ballymore and its commercial partner Oxley Holdings had agreed to sell all 268 luxury apartments at Dublin Landings to Greystar for ‚Ç¨175.5m. There are five Grade A office buildings on the Dublin Landings complex. No 1. The Landings has been let to the NTMA and sold to German institutional investor Triuva. No 2. The Landings has been let to WeWork and sold to the REIT company JR AMC while the Central Bank of Ireland acquired two of the remaining three office buildings - No 4, The Landings, and No 5, The Landings. Ballymore is also involved in delivering a large mixed-use scheme on 2.8 hectares at Dublin's Connolly station in Dublin's IFSC and a ‚Ç¨31.3 million housing development in Naas.

He was, with Thomas Elder, a partner in Elder Stirling and Company before that firm became Elder Smith and Company, which proved profitable. He speculated, with some success, in the Moonta and Wallaroo mines. He was Director of the South Australian Banking Company from April 1859 to the end of 1864.

Academic career He was a graduate in mathematics from University of Sydney. In 1980, he graduated from the University of Oregon with a PhD in biomechanics. His thesis was titled A kinematic and kinetic analysis of selected parameters during the support phase of running. From 1980 to 1982, Mason was a Lecturer at the University of Wollongong. Australian Institute of Sport Mason was appointed the inaugural Head of Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Biomechanics department in 1982. In 1982, he was joined at the AIS by Dr Dick Telford, Co-ordinator of Sport Science, Dr Peter Fricker, Sports Physician, Craig Purdam, Physiotherapist and Jeff Bond, Sport Psychologist. In the early days of the AIS, Mason described his role a jack of all trades in biomechanics. He assisted golfers refine their swing and track and field athletes with their technique. As the AIS developed, he focussed on swimming. Mason and his team developed wet-plate analysis, which offers real-time assessment of athletes in the pool. Prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Mason worked withs swimwear maker Speedo's to develop its \\"Beijing suit\\", a superfast polyurethane-coated bodysuit. The swim suit became known as LZR Racer. In July 2009, FINA changed its rules was banned ban all body-length swimsuits due to the large number of world records being broken by the new high tech swimsuits. In 2006, Mason became Head of the AIS's Aquatic Testing, Training and Research Unit, a position that he held until his retirement in September 2014. During this period, Mason was responsible for designing $17million the AIS Aquatics Centre, which opened in 2007. The pool has a range of high-tech performance analysis devices and biomechanical systems including instrumented start blocks and turn walls, timing gates, filming trolleys and strategically placed cameras. Mason has worked with leading AIS swimmers including Olympic gold medallists Petria Thomas, Michael Klim and Alicia Coutts. From the early 1990s to 2004, Mason worked with the Australian Swim Team including Olympic gold medallists Ian Thorpe, Kieren Perkins, Grant Hackett, Susie O'Neill and Jess Schipper.

The school was closed in Summer 2016. It was a voluntary aided school administered by Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool. The school was named after Saint Ambrose Barlow, one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. St Ambrose Barlow Catholic High School offered GCSEs, BTECs and OCR Nationals as programmes of study for pupils. Graduating pupils wishing to enter sixth form usually went on to attend South Sefton College which is located nearby. In July 2015 the Archdiocese of Liverpool announced that it had written to Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council to request legal proceedings to formally close St Ambrose Barlow Catholic High School. Reasons for the closure included a decrease in pupil numbers at the school. This led to a local petition to save the school from closure; however, this failed, meaning the school could not be saved from closure. In January 2016 Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council approved the closure for the end of the summer term in 2016. In July 2016, the school closed.

It is approximately long and flows through Davidson Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is acidic and is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by atmospheric deposition. Rock formations in the watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation and the Burgoon Sandstone. Soils in the watershed include the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association, and the Oquaga and Norwich soil associations. There are some waterfalls on the stream. Course Quinn Run begins in northern Davidson Township. It flows southeast for a short distance before turning south and entering a valley. After some distance, the stream turns east-southeast and receives the tributary Shanty Run. Approximately further downstream, Quinn Run reaches its confluence with Heberly Run just upstream of Lewis Falls. Quinn Run reaches its confluence with Heberly Run upstream of its mouth. Hydrology During average flow conditions, the discharge of Quinn Run is 1111 gallons per minute. The concentration of aluminum in the stream is 0.114 milligrams per liter during average flow conditions and the pH is 5.75. Quinn Run experiences episodic acidification. However, it is not extremely deficient in alkalinity. Quinn Run has \\"good\\" water quality during average flow conditions and \\"very poor\\" water quality during high flow conditions. However, several methods have been proposed to improve its water quality by increasing alkalinity. These methods include the addition of vertical flow wetlands at the stream's headwaters, forest surface liming, and road liming. Quinn Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by atmospheric deposition due to pH. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Quinn Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between and . Most of Quinn Run is on rock of the Huntley Mountain Formation. However, the stream's upper reaches are on rock of the Burgoon Sandstone formation. There are some rock outcroppings in the watershed.

It was released worldwide on Steam on 27 August 2014, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions released in May 2017. A sequel, Lethal League Blaze, was released on Steam in October 2018. Gameplay Lethal League is a 2D arena fighting video game in which up to four players face off against each other in an arena. The goal is to hit a ball back and forth, and have the ball hit other players until there's only one player left. With each consecutive hit, the ball will speed up more, making it harder for the other players to not get hit and hit the ball back. In their review, Destructoid described the game as \\"If Mario Tennis and Smash Bros. had a baby, and it was raised by European DJs who love baseball.\\" Development Lethal League started out as a flash game, the idea coming from the developers playing around with a 'hit and reflect projectile mechanic' in Team Reptile's first game, Megabyte Punch. The flash game was picked up by several media outlets and was the Mystery Game at the UFGT9 fighting game tournament. After being very well received, the developer decided to flesh out the prototype and develop it into a full game to be released on Steam. The more fleshed out version of Lethal League was first showcased at the 2014 Casual Connect Europe, and later at EVO's indie showcase and gamescom, where the game was a crowd favorite. In 2016, the game was part of the Humble Indie Bundle 17 with ports to Mac OS X and Linux. In 2017, Team Reptile announced a remake of Lethal League, titled Lethal League Blaze, that included fully 3D models and animations. It was released in October 2018. Reception Lethal League was released on 27 August 2014 and has received mostly positive reviews. Many reviewers praised Lethal League for being \\"easy to learn, spectacular to watch and complex to master\\" and for being a lot of fun to play on the couch with friends. Destructoid's Ben Pack ended his review saying \\"It‚Äôs my personal favorite of the revival of couch co-op games, and may be my favorite ‚Äútell a friend‚Äù game of all time.\\"The game sold over 100.000 units worldwide by April 2015.

All were born to Muhammad's first wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid except one son, who was born to Maria al-Qibtiyya. Overview His attitude and treatment towards his children, enshrined in the hadith, is viewed by Muslims as an exemplar to be imitated. All of Muhammad's children, except Fatimah (married to Ali ibn Abi Talib) and two daughters Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum, another daughter of Muhammad died in childhood and it is through Fatimah that Muhammad's lineage continued in the form of the respected Sayyid (meaning Leader or Sir) and Sharif (meaning noble). His sons never reached adulthood and died as infants. The early deaths of Muhammad's sons has been viewed as being detrimental to the cause of those who advocated for a hereditary-based system of succession to Muhammad. List of children  Muhammad's children were (in chronological order): *Qasim ibn Muhammad, (AD 598 ‚Äì 601) *Zainab bint Muhammad, (AD 599 ‚Äì 629) *Ruqayyah bint Muhammad, (AD 601 ‚Äì 624) *Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, (AD 603 ‚Äì 630) *Fatimah bint Muhammad, ( AD 605 ‚Äì 632) *Abdullah ibn Muhammad, (AD 615) *Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, (AD 630-632) A notable connection here is that they all died at relatively young ages; ranging from 2-30 years. Controversy There is much controversy between Sunni and Shia regarding how many daughters Muhammad had. While most Sunnis accept that he had four daughters, most Shia accept Fatimah as his only biological daughter and that 3 women were already living in the house of Khadijah before her marriage with Muhammad.

The tower contains a clock, and four bells. The earliest work in the building is Norman, of which style the south doorway and some piers and arches on that side are plain examples. The tower is Early English, with a later battlement added; the rest is Decorated, with some very good windows. At the angles of the aisles are large gurgoyles, and there is a cross on the apex of the nave. The south aisle is divided from the nave by two pointed arches supported by a massive circular pillar; the north side being ornamented with a band of zig-zag moulding. The pillar on the south side is decorated with curious carving, probably from designs brought home by a crusader, depicting grotesque dragons having two heads, one at each extremity, and foliage. In one of the square piers in the south aisle is a slab, carved in bold relief, with some creature resembling a serpent and two curiously formed animals. The two pointed arches of the north aisle rise to a greater height than the arches on the opposite side. There is a piscina at the east end of the south aisle, shewing the spot to be the site of an altar in ancient times. In the south aisle are the steps which formerly led to the rood loft. The oak roofs are not concealed by ceilings; that of the nave is supported by sculptured corbels of stone. The six clerestory windows are pointed, and of two lights each. The pulpit is of oak, and octagonal in shape. At the west end is a circular arch, now filled up; and the walls throughout the church retain much of the old paintings in distemper. The chancel arch is pointed, and the east window is of four lights, with quatrefoils in the head, and filled with stained glass, representing Our Lord seated, and in the act of blessing; angels, the sacred monogram, the symbols of the Evangelists, flowers, and foliage. The sedilia, or three seats in the south wall for the priests, has trefoil heading, and a plain band running along the top. In the same wall is the piscina, a very good one, with a pillar supporting the arch. The chancel is paved with black and white marble, laid at the cost of Sir H. Andrewes, bart, at the request of his daughter Margaret, to whom there is a long poetic epitaph in this marble floor. On many of the white marble squares are memorials of the Andrewes family interred there. Near the communion-table is an inscription to Elizabeth, Lady Leigh, Baroness of Stonly, who died in 1678. On the north side of the chancel is a mural marble tablet with the representation of a lady in Elizabethan costume kneeling at an altar, behind her is a youth, also kneeling, and two babies in a cradle; above the heads of the children are the arms and crest of the family of Chandflower. Near the above, is a brass plate, with arms, and under them, an inscription. In the nave, near the pulpit, is affixed a brass plate, with arms, crest, and inscription. In the north aisle is a mural monument of marble, containing a long inscription to Henry Uthwatt. In the same vault is buried Frances (died 1800), his wife, daughter of Sir J. Chester, Bart. There are likewise in the church memorials of the families of Dobinson and Forster. The church register dates from 1690.

Plot summary In Scepter Tower of Spellgard, a mysterious presence has taken up residence in one of the towers of Spellgard, and now its dark minions plague the Gray Vale. This is the first full-length Forgotten Realms adventure published for 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. This adventure can be paired with the adventure that appears in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide. This stand-alone adventure is designed to take characters from 2nd level to 4th level. Publication history FR1 Scepter Tower of Spellgard was published in 2008, and was written by David Noonan and Greg A. Vaughan, with art by Attila Adorjany, Miguel Coimbra, Robert Lazzaretti, Warren Mahy, Jim Pavelec, Steve Prescott, and Emi Tanji. Shannon Appelcline commented that with Fourth Edition Dungeons & Dragons, Wizards planned to publish just three books for each setting, and after that they would start on a new setting in the next year: \\"The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (2008), the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide (2008) and FR1: Scepter Tower of Spellgard (2008) kicked off the cycle‚Ä¶ and were some of Wizards' worst-received supplements ever. This was largely because Wizards had decided to destroy the old Forgotten Realms to make it fit into their ideas of a 'points of light' setting. Old gods and NPCs were gone, kingdoms had fallen, the timeline was dramatically advanced and the Realms lay in ruins. From the scathing reviews that the new setting books got, it seems likely that they did as much to alienate existing fans from fourth-edition play as the core rulebooks had.\\" Reception References Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Forgotten Realms adventures ","title":"Scepter Tower of Spellgard"},{"id":"43694501","text":"The Camp Speicher massacre occurred on 12 June 2014, when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) killed at least 1,095 to 1,700 or moreIraqi people in an attack on Camp Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq. At the time of the massacre, there were between 5,000 and 10,000 unarmed cadets in the camp, and ISIL fighters selected the Shias and non-Muslims for execution. It is the second deadliest act of terrorism in history. The Iraqi government blamed the massacre on ISIL. Attack Before the massacre, according to the Iraqi politician Mish'an al-Jubori, \\"Some of the chief officers of the camp ordered the cadets to have a rest for 15 days and to go to their families, with civilian clothes\\". Several survivors later testified that their senior officers in the camp had forced them to leave the camp. Hassan Khalil, one survivor, who managed to escape by pretending to be dead under another corpse and fleeing at night, said: \\"Our chief officers are the reason behind the killings. They forced us to leave Speicher. They assured us there was a safe passage, that it was guarded by the tribes, and told us not to wear uniforms.\\" \\"They sold us to ISIS\\" he added. The Iraqi government and national television refuted that story. They said the cadets forced their way out of the camps after the military had already dispatched special forces to the dangerous camps' area to secure them, and that they'd been warned against leaving.http://burathanews.com/arabic/reports/247028 While the cadets were walking on the highway looking for a bus to take them to Baghdad, two buses stopped near them with 10 armed men inside. One bus was driven by Ayman Sabawi Ibrahim, the son of Saddam Hussein's half-brother, Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti. Several more buses with ISIL members arrived, and the cadets were kidnapped at gunpoint and taken to the Al-Qusour Al-Re'asiya region. Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch (HRW), stated: \\"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation. [ISIS] and other abusive forces should know that the eyes of Iraqis and the world are watching\\". HRW also said that ISIL posted on its websites many videos and photographs showing how they beheaded and shot their victims while they celebrated. The photos show masked ISIL fighters tying up the cadets and loading them up on trucks, with other photographs showing ISIL fighters killing dozens of the cadets with assault rifles while they are lying down. ISIL propaganda videos show them shooting at hundreds of men lined up in mass graves in the desert. Some cadets faked their death, covering themselves with blood and escaping at night. Survivor Ali Hussein Kadhim told his story to The New York Times following his escape from the massacre. ISIL released footage of the massacre as part of their propaganda video Upon the Prophetic Methodology. The cadets are seen being crammed into trucks, some of them wearing civilian clothes to hide their military uniforms. Most of them are lying on the ground, with their jeans stripped to reveal camouflage uniforms underneath. Some of the prisoners were forced to defame Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, while others were forced to shout \\"long live the Islamic State\\". Some of them lined up as a cadet was beaten to death with a rifle. The killing methods varied, from shooting the cadets one by one to shooting them while lying down many times to ensure death. Some cadets were shot and thrown into the Tigris river. Aftermath Memorial for dead of the Camp Speicher massacre at the location of the incident at the presidential palaces in Tikrit The Iraqi government said that 57 members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party had taken part in the massacre. Although pictures showed that every armed man was from ISIS, the government stated \\"Without any doubts and suspicion, all of these criminals are from the banned Ba'ath Party.\\" The Minister of Defense, Sa'dun al-Dulaimi, stated that the massacre was not sectarian in nature. Although the spokesman of the Iraqi Armed Forces, Qasim Atta, stated that there were almost 11,000 cadets and soldiers missing from Camp Speicher; he also stated that thousands were executed in or near the presidential palaces, the al-Bu Agail region, and the Badoush prison by sectarian violence. On 2 September, more than 100 members of the families of the killed and missing cadets and soldiers broke into the Iraqi Parliament and hit three of the security guards. After a day, a session started in the parliament with the attendance of representatives of the families and Sa'dun al-Dulaimi, along with other military officials to discuss the massacre. On 16 September, the Kurdish Asayish arrested four people suspected to be involved in the massacre in southern Kirkuk. An unnamed security source stated, \\"The operation was executed by relying on intelligence information to arrest them.\\" On 18 September, the Iraqi Human Rights ministry stated that as of 17 September, the total number of missing soldiers and cadets was 1,095, denying the most popular figure of 1,700 soldiers having been killed. The ministry added, \\"The ministry relied in its statistics on spreading forms on the families of the missing people in Baghdad and the other governorate within its quest to document the crimes and violations that the terrorist group of the Islamic State is committing towards our people.\\" The Iraqi government ordered them to pay 10 million Iraqi dinar (equivalent to US$8,600) to the families of the missing cadets. Following the Iraqi forces' victory over ISIL in Tikrit in early April 2015, mass graves containing some of the murdered cadets were located and the decomposed corpses began to be exhumed. Two of the alleged perpetrators of the massacre were arrested in Forssa, Finland, in December 2015. The suspects were identified from ISIL propaganda videos in which the executions of 11 men took place. Police did not disclose whether the men had made applications for asylum in Finland. On 13 December 2016, the 24-year-old twins were charged with murder and committing a war crime for allegedly killing unarmed cadets, as well as \\"aggravated assault with terrorist aims\\". In August 2016, 36 men were executed by hanging for their part in the massacre. On 6 September 2016, three mass graves were found by the Kata‚Äôib al-Imam brigade containing the remains of over 30 people killed in the massacre. In August 2017, 27 people were sentenced to death for their involvement in the massacre, and another 25 men were released due to lack of evidence.

Greene first served commendably in the U.S. Special Forces, learning Vietnamese while serving in the Vietnam War. He retired after 20 years to begin a new career as a Paramilitary Officer in the Special Activities Division (renamed Special Activities Center in 2016 https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/04/measuring-change-at-the-cia/) of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After joining the CIA's Directorate of Operations in 1967, he underwent training before deploying overseas in March 1968. Soon after, his wife died in an auto accident. Greene returned to the U.S. and arranged care for his young children before returning overseas to his assignment. Known by his call sign \\"Black Lion,\\" Green remained in the most dangerous forward Hmong outposts even when ordered to evacuate. From there he directed Hmong troops in heavy combat. In one instance, on 2 December 1969, Green rallied pro-American guerrillas retreating from a communist attack on Phou Nok Kok by his direction of close air support.Conboy, Morrison, p. 250.

The lake covers . It is named in honor of John Y. Todd, an early settler in Central Oregon. Today, the lake and surrounding forest is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of the Deschutes National Forest. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regularly stocks the lake with brook trout. There is a day-use area and a rustic campground located on the west shore of the lake. In the summer, Todd Lake is a popular outdoor recreation site for picnicking, fishing, hiking, and nature viewing. In the winter, trails in the Todd Lake area are used for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.  History  Originally, Todd Lake was called \\"Lost Lake\\" because it was difficult for people to find. In the early 20th century, citizens of Bend, Oregon, asked that the name of the lake be changed to avoid confusion with several other Oregon lakes with the same name. In 1922, the name of the lake was officially changed to Todd Lake. The name honors John Y. Todd, an early pioneer in central Oregon. Todd immigrated to Oregon in 1852. In 1860, he built the first bridge across the Deschutes River. Later, he became a successful cattle rancher. Todd founded of the Farewell Bend Ranch, which gave the city of Bend its name.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

Todd Lake and the surrounding forest are part of the Bend-Fort Rock Ranger District, an administrative sub-division of the Deschutes National Forest. In 1964, the United States Congress created the Three Sisters Wilderness surrounding the Three Sisters mountains in Oregon's Cascade Range. Todd Lake is just outside the southern boundary of the wilderness. As a result, Todd Lake is a major wilderness access point for hikers.\\"Three Sisters Wilderness\\", Wilderness.net, Wilderness Institute, College of Forestry and Conservation, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, 25 August 2014. Road access to Todd Lake has always been via Forest Road 46 (also known as the Cascade Lakes Highway). In 1989, the Forest Service designated the road as a National Forest Scenic Byway. In 1997, the State of Oregon made the road an Oregon state scenic byway. A year later, the federal government officially designated the highway as a national scenic byway, calling it the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway.Gyorgyfalvy, Robin Lee, \\"Byway History\\" (PDF), Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway Corridor Management and Interpretive Plan 2011, Deschutes National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 2011, p. 7. Many travel guides for the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway mention Todd Lake, highlighting its location as the first Cascade lake along the byway.\\"The Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway\\", Trip Check, Oregon Department of Transportation, Salem, Oregon, 27 August 2014.\\"Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway\\" (PDF), Discover Oregon Scenic Byways and Tour Routes Driving Guide, Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation in cooperation with Oregon Department of Transportation and Travel Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 2009, pp. 28-30.\\"Cascades Lakes Scenic Byway\\", Travel Oregon, Oregon Tourism Commission, Salem, Oregon, 27 August 2014.\\"The Cascade Lakes\\" (PDF), Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway Tour of Interpretive Sites, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, District of Columbia, 2010.  Geology and geography  Todd Lake is located on the east side of the Cascade Range in central Oregon, southwest of Bend. It is situated in a small glacial valley at the base of Broken Top, southwest of the peak. The glacier that created the valley melted away about 13,000 years ago, leaving a glacial cirque. As a result, the lake is relatively deep for its size. The lake's elevation is above sea level.Todd Lake topographic map, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, Reston, Virginia; displayed via ACME mapper, www.acme.com, 23 August 2014. Most of the lake water comes from snow melt. The only year-round inflow is drainage from Bare Lake, a very small natural lake located southwest of Todd Lake. The lake's only outlet is Todd Creek, which begins at the south end of the lake. Todd Creek disappears in a lava field approximately southwest of the lake.  Environment  Todd Lake, frozen and covered with snow The watershed that drains into Todd Lake, covering only , is covered by a dense conifer forest. Mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and various fir species dominate the forest around the lake. However, there is a narrow strip of meadow land along the south and west side of the lake, and a large meadow at the north end.\\"Pacific Northwest Region Viewing Area\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend Oregon, 22 August 2014.Horn, Elizabeth L., Oregon's Best Wildflower Hikes, Southern Region, Westcliffe Publishers: Englewood, Colorado, 2006, pp. 210‚Äì213. Todd Lake is a natural lake that covers . It is approximately long and wide. The lake has an average depth of with a maximum depth of near its south end. Because of its sheltered location, Todd Lake has distinct thermal stratification levels within its water column. As a result, water below in depth remains extremely cold even during the summer. The alkalinity level is typical of other high-elevation lakes in the Cascade Range. The lake's water transparency is good, with a Secchi disk depth of . Concentration of chlorophyll in the lake is low. A 1982 study showed that Todd Lake had a high concentration of phosphorus, which is typical of mountain lakes in the central Cascades. Based on available data, the lake's trophic state is classified as oligotrophic.  Flora  Jeffrey's shooting star There is a great diversity of plant life in the areas around Todd Lake. The conifer forest that surrounds the lake is dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and various fir species. Ground cover in the shaded parts of the forest includes bog huckleberry, whortleberry, smooth woodrush, Brewer's mitrewort, and sidebells. In open areas of the forest Jacob's ladder, alpine lake agoseris, and larkspur are common ground cover.Gyorgyfalvy, Robin Lee, \\"Todd Lake\\" (PDF), Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway Corridor Management and Interpretive Plan 2011], Deschutes National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 2011, p. 45. The meadow areas around Todd Lake are well known for their wildflowers. Wildflowers bloom around the lake from late June through mid-August. The peak of the wildflower display is in mid- July. Many wildflowers continue to bloom throughout the summer, making Todd Lake an ideal place for nature viewing. As a result, the Forest Service has designated Todd Lake as a Pacific Northwest Region wildflower viewing area. The wildflower show begins in late June when the Jeffrey's shooting star and white marsh marigold bloom in the wet meadows and riparian areas. Newberry's knotweed is an early bloomer on the well-drained slopes above the lake. Then, elephanthead and other alpine plants begin to bloom in the meadows and along the lake shore. Common meadow wildflowers include Jeffrey's shooting star, elephanthead, Gorman's buttercup, alpine asters, American alpine speedwell, Indian paintbrush, small-flowered paintbrush, high mountain cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, green false hellebore, swamp laurel, and white bog orchid (Habenaria dilatata). Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and marsh marigold grow close to the lake shore. In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf groundsel, and false asphodel. Oregon saxifrage lives in some of the boggy areas around the lake. On the edge of the meadows near the forest and along the Bare Creek drainage, there are high mountain cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, Sitka valerian, cobwebby Indian paintbrush, harsh Indian paintbrush, broadleaf lupine, and alpine lake agoseris. On drier slopes above the lake, Newberry's knotweed, larkspur, bracted lousewort, peregrine fleabane, dwarf lupine, sulphur flower, Martindale's lomatium, pussypaws, pink mountain heather, and Brewers mountain heather are common along with alpine lake agoseris.  Fauna  American wigeon The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regularly stocks Todd Lake with brook trout. These are the only game fish found in the lake. The trout average in length and some reach . There are a number of reptiles and amphibians found in and around Todd Lake. Reptiles include the common garter snake and northern alligator lizard. Amphibians include the western toad, Cascade frog, Oregon spotted frog, Pacific chorus frog, Pacific giant salamander, northwestern salamander, Oregon slender salamander, clouded salamander, Dunn's salamander, long-tailed salamander, and rough-skinned newt.\\"Wildlife list for Soda Creek\\", Oregon Wildlife Explorer, National Resources Digital Library, Oregon State University Libraries, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, 24 August 2014. The western toad and the Cascade frog are threatened species. Both species are under the protection of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. It is illegal to harm or collect these species.\\"Todd Lake Campground\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend Oregon, 22 August 2014. The Todd Lake area is also home to over 160 bird species. In the general area of the lake, birdwatchers can see a wide variety of waterfowl, songbirds, forest birds, and birds of prey. Waterfowl include mallards, wood duck, American wigeon, northern shoveler, American coot, Barrow's goldeneye, common merganser, hooded mergansers, and Canada geese. Common shore and wetland birds include American dipper, spotted sandpiper, black tern, double- crested cormorant, great blue heron, and sandhill crane. The meadows and forest around the lake are home to American goldfinch, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, red crossbill, Brewers sparrow, house sparrow, song sparrow, yellow- rumped warbler, olive-sided flycatcher, Cordilleran flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, dusky flycatcher, mountain chickadee, black-capped chickadee, evening grosbeak, dark-eyed junco, western tanager, American robin, western bluebird, mountain bluebird, hermit thrush, Townsend's solitaire, sage thrasher, golden-crowned kinglet, ruby-crowned kinglet, warbling vireo, house wren, cedar waxwing, barn swallow, cliff swallow, and tree swallow. Other forest birds found in the area include northern flicker, Clark's nutcracker, red-breasted nuthatch, Brown creeper, brown-headed cowbird, pinyon jay, Steller's jay, Brewer's blackbird, common raven, and California quail. Local woodpecker species include American three-toed woodpecker, downy woodpecker, Pileated woodpecker, and hairy woodpecker. There are also two hummingbird species found in the area, Rufous hummingbirds and Calliope hummingbirds. The lake also attracts a wide variety of birds of prey. There are seven owl species‚Äînorthern pygmy owl, flammulated owl, boreal owl, spotted owl, barn owl, great gray owl, and great horned owl. There are also American kestrels, peregrine falcons, northern goshawks, Cooper's hawks, red-tailed hawks, osprey, golden eagles, bald eagles, and turkey vultures. The mixed conifer forest around Todd Lake is home to numerous mammals. The large mammals include black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, coyotes, American black bear, bobcats, and cougars. Some of the small mammals found in the Todd Lake area include American badger, North American beaver, mountain beaver, porcupine, raccoon, striped skunk, western spotted skunk, American marten, mink, long-tailed weasel, western gray squirrel, American pika, least chipmunk, Townsend's chipmunk, bushy-tailed woodrat, and deer mouse, as well as several shrew and vole species. There are also three bat species that live near Todd Lake.  Recreation  Trail network from Todd Lake Today, Todd Lake is a very popular recreation site. The Forest Service carefully manages the area in order to provide recreational opportunities for visitors while ensuring that the sensitive lake environment is protected. During the summer, the lake is a favorite place for picnicking, swimming, fishing, hiking, and nature viewing. No motorized boats are allowed on the lake, so watercraft use is limited to canoes, kayaks, rafts, inner tubes, and other non-motorized craft. There is a day-use area and a rustic campground on the west shore of the lake. The day- use facilities include picnic tables, fire pits, and a vault toilet. The campground has three tent-only campsites and a vault toilet. There is no potable water at the lake. From May through September, the Forest Service charges a modest fee for using the Todd Lake recreation area.\\"Todd Lake Day Use Area/Trailhead\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend Oregon, 22 August 2014.Morris, Elizabeth and Mark Morris, (revised by Judy Jewell and Bill McRae), \\"Todd Lake\\", Moon Oregon (seventh edition), Avalon Travel Publishing, Emeryville, California, March 2007, p. 438. There are also a variety of trails near the lake for hiking and horseback riding. Because Todd Lake is located just outside the Three Sisters Wilderness, it is a major access point for hikers and campers heading into the wilderness. The trailhead for Todd Trail #34 is located at the south end of the lake. Todd Trail connects to Soda Creek Trail #11 from Sparks Lake. It then joins Broken Top Trail #10 running along the south side of Broken Top to Green Lakes Trail #17, which leads north to the Green Lakes at the base of the South Sister. During the summer, dogs must be kept on a leash when hiking on trails in the Three Sisters Wilderness, including all the trails mentioned above. The leash rules also apply to the Todd Lake day-use area, campground, and the trail that follows the shore around the lake. In the winter, the highway to Todd Lake is closed due to snow. However, the trails around Todd Lake are very popular routes for cross- country skiing and snowshoeing. The closest road access is from the Mount Bachelor Nordic Center or Dutchman Sno-park, which are both near Mount Bachelor ski area, approximately east of the lake.Hagemeier, Heidi, \\"Skiing Todd Lake Trail\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 30 December 2010.Gyorgyfalvy, Robin Lee, \\"Description\\" (PDF), Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway Corridor Management and Interpretive Plan 2011, Deschutes National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 2011, p. 6.

Plot Porky is sitting on a rocking chair reading the newspaper while his pet cat sleeps nearby. He spots an ad for fishing season and tells his cat about it but first he makes him guess what they'll be having for dinner tomorrow; the cat asks if it's chicken and Porky replies that it isn't, making the cat disappointed. Porky then tells the cat that it's fish; hearing this, the cat parades around the house, bouncing off the walls and pauses to pull a mouse out of its hole and kisses it. Porky's canary sees this and declares \\"Well, now I've seen everything!\\". He pulls out a gun and commits suicide‚Äìallegedly this is the first cartoon to feature this popular trope. That night, the cat is having trouble sleeping so he takes a bottle of sleeping pills which contains a mallet‚Äìhe hits himself with it, knocking himself out. The next day, they go down to the fishing hole and spot a flying fish that is literally flying out of the pond. The cat knocks out the fish with a swipe of his claws and picks it up; Porky says, \\"Well, Pussy, it looks like we're having fish for di-di-di- supper!\\" The fish regains consciousness and says \\"That's what you think, chum!\\", while laughing hysterically and honking the cat's nose. The flying fish skids through the water, laughing all the way, and dives back into the lake. The cat looks for the fish while sticking his face underwater; the fish punches the cat's nose like a punching bag and, climbing on the cat's back and playing his tail like a cello, he taunts the cat and knocks him into the water. The fish torments Porky and makes him think that he caught him, but he goes up and down like a yo-yo on Porky's fishing line. Meanwhile, the cat recovers, and the fish tells the audience, \\"Hey, gang, get a load of this!\\". The fish dives into the water sideways, making his fin look like a shark's; Porky tells the cat to look out, but the cat sees this and grabs the fish by the fin, only to realize that he is now holding a real shark. The cat and Porky run off into the distance; the shark turns to the audience and says, \\"pussy cats is de cwaziest peoples!\\" The shark laughs while the cartoon irises out.

After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author.  Reception  Most early reviews were positive. A critic found \\"the dramatic tale compounded of mystery and romance, and full of surprises for even the most wary reader.\\" Another critic said it was \\"a novel to delight the most romantic reader.\\" Mistress of Mellyn became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.

Lebanese people form one of the largest community of non-citizen Arabs in the UAE. In addition, an increasing number of Lebanese students seeking education and career opportunities opted for the country in light of its relatively reputable institutions across the Middle East, the case that applies mostly to those born in United Arab Emirates. The Lebanese people tend to be spread out over various emirates of the country, with areas of high concentration being Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.Currently, the Lebanese job market is fully dominant by Lebanese national especially for specific industries such as consulting where large population of Lebanese are spread across all big consulting firms.  Background  Early migration of Lebanese people to the Emirates began during Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) which resulted in a high influx of Lebanese moving their businesses to Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi and continued to do so during the 1990s and the further ongoing civil unrest in Lebanon due to the 2011 Syrian Civil War. The majority of Lebanese expatriates that fled during the Lebanese Civil War to the UAE are highly educated, fluent in both French and English languages, and affluent as well as being involved in business and the media as beauty surgeons, businessmen, artists, presenters and news anchors.
