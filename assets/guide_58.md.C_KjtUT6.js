Users may choose from 90-second training sessions or long-term 4-week goal oriented sessions. Reception Shape Up received mixed reviews upon release. GameRankings assigned it an average review score of 56.00% based on 5 reviews. Robin Parker from God is a Geek gave the game a 7/10, praising its vibrant art style, accurate performance of the Kinect sensor. He also praised the game for successfully making fitness entertaining, challenging and interesting. Marcus Estrada from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 2/5. He criticized the unforgiving difficulty of the game, lack of content and variety of quests, over-emphasis on speed instead of actual techniques and over-reliance on post-launch paid content. He also criticized the game for not reminding players' positioning problems or potential accidents. He described the game by saying that \\"Shape Up is a cool concept but a hollow experience which doesn‚Äôt have nearly enough going for it to keep players hooked long term.\\" References External links *Official website Category:2014 video games Category:Exergames Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox One-only games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Kinect games ","title":"Shape Up (video game)"},{"id":"43425638","text":"Theila siennata is a moth in the family Crambidae.

It preserves fossils dating back to the Wordian stage of the Permian period.Gnishik Formation in the Paleobiology Database The thin-bedded limestones of the formation reach a thickness of in the Julfa section of northwestern Iran and in the Arpa River valley of Armenia. The sediments were deposited in an open marine setting at the northern edge of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The coral Wentzellophyllum gnishikense was named after the formation.  Description  The Gnishik Formation was first formally described by Arakelyan in 1964, based on a section in the Gnishik River valley, after which the formation was named. The formation is mostly represented by thin-bedded, occasionally shaly, dark grey and black bituminous foraminiferal-algal biodetrital limestones. The occasional admixture of clayey and terrigenous material colors the limestones light grey and yellowish. The thin-bedded layers alternate with coarser-bedded compact varieties.Leven, 1998, p.302 The open marine limestones of the formation reach a thickness of in the Julfa section of northwestern Iran. In Iran, the formation overlies the Dorud Formation and is overlain by the Khachik Formation, while in Armenia the formation rests on top of the Asni Formation and is overlain by the Arpa Formation.Leven, 1998, p.301 The Gnishik Formation represents an increase in subsidence rate in the Permian.Saidi et al., 1997, p.198 The sediments were deposited at the northern edge of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The formation is dated to the late Murgabian,Leven, 1998, p.308 which belongs to the Wordian stage of the Middle Permian.

He retired from his position as Corporate Vice President of CBS in 1976. Jencks was also a former president of the Alliance of Television and Film Producers, or ATFP, which is now called the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Early life and education Jencks, a fourth generation Californian, was born in Oakland, California, in 1921. As a child, he vacationed during the summer at Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe, where his family had opened a resort (present-day Stanford Sierra Camp). He initially enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, but left to join the U.S. military during World War II. He served as a commanding officer for several harbor defense vessels, which placed anti- submarine nets and torpedo net throughout the Aleutian Islands and the Caribbean Sea during the war. He enrolled at Stanford University after the war, where he earned both his bachelor's degree (1946) and his law degree (1948). Career Following law school, Jencks joined the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in Washington, D.C. as an associate general counsel. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he became West Coast Resident Attorney for CBS, Inc. He later left CBS to become president of the Alliance of Television and Film Producers. While working in Los Angeles, Jencks became the first president of the West Pasadena Residents' Association, serving in 1962-1963. He also served on the Pasadena City Council. Jencks returned to CBS as the television network's general counsel and was later named president of the CBS Broadcast Group, which included CBS News, CBS Television Network, CBS Radio Network, Cinema Center Films, and the television and radio stations owned by CBS. When CBS became the target of accusations of excessive depictions of sex and violence by the Nixon administration during the early 1970s, Jencks, who was a CBS corporate vice president at the time, flew to Washington to defend the broadcast network against the allegations. He remained in Washington, D.C. until his retirement in 1976. Jencks was appointed a distinguished visiting professor of communications at San Diego State University and was a founding member of the board of directors for the University of California at Berkeley Foundation. He served as well on the editorial board for the Marin Independent Journal. Jencks began appearing on a weekly radio opinion show called \\"2 Minutes with Richard\\" on KSCO when he was 85 years old and was frequently in demand as a speaker on broadcasting and other communication subjects. Personal life He and his wife, Mary, resided in Stinson Beach, California, for fifteen years before moving to nearby Mill Valley, California. Jencks died on June 30, 2014, at the age of 93. He was survived by his wife; two children, Michael Reynolds Jencks and Nancy de Laguna Jencks and four step-children - Lynn Christopher Collins, Martha M. Barrett, Elizabeth B. Snyder, and George B.

Animation for Adult Swim. It premiered October 27, 2014. The series features Mike Tyson solving mysteries, in the style of I Am the Greatest: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali, Scooby-Doo, Jonny Quest, and Mr. T. On December 10, 2014, Adult Swim renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on November 1, 2015. A third season premiered on May 14, 2017, and the remaining Season 3 episodes aired from March 4, 2018 to May 13, 2018. A fourth season aired in Summer 2019 and early 2020. During a May 2020 interview, writer Larry Dorf revealed the show had not been renewed and the fourth season would be its last. Adult Swim aired reruns as of 2020. Premise The show follows the fictional misadventures of boxer/actor Mike Tyson, the ghost of the Marquess of Queensberry, Tyson's adopted daughter, and an alcoholic talking pigeon, as they solve mysteries around the world. The style of the show borrows heavily from the 1983‚Äì86 Ruby-Spears produced Mister T featuring actor/wrestler Laurence Tureaud as himself as well as 1970's Hanna-Barbera productions such as Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! and The Funky Phantom. Targeted at a much older demographic than those children-oriented cartoons, the show contains adult language and concepts in the manner of Family Guy, South Park, and many other Adult Swim shows. While each episode involves a mystery as a framing device, they are often ignored entirely while the plot takes a completely different (and often oddball) direction as the mysteries are rarely solved and episodes sometimes end on cliffhangers that are never resolved. Characters =Main characters= * Mike Tyson (voiced by himself) ‚Äì The title character of the series, Mike Tyson is a retired boxer who now solves mysteries. He is portrayed as being wildly out of touch with reality, confusing a chess Grandmaster with the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, or Elon Musk with Elton John, thinking a binary code spells out 'Ooo', and eating junk food without realizing he's on a diet. He has a reputation for doing unusual things like taking an oatmeal bath with cooked oatmeal, owning a pet grizzly bear, and using mosquitoes to help him sleep, along with pronouncing the names of many other characters incorrectly, even by calling his own daughter Yang or Yee instead of Yung. * Pigeon (voiced by Norm Macdonald) ‚Äì An alcoholic, sexually depraved, sarcastic pigeon. He is a former human who was turned into a pigeon by his ex-wife as a curse for cheating on her. His real name is revealed to be Richard, although everyone still calls him Pigeon. Pigeon is disliked by Marquess and Yung Hee, but Tyson is seemingly oblivious to his obnoxious nature. Pigeon is Yung Hee's biological father from a one-night stand, although Pigeon keeps this information to himself after observing how close Mike and Yung Hee are. * Yung Hee Tyson (voiced by Rachel Ramras) ‚Äì Mike's adopted daughter. Born in 1998, she was left by her birth mother on Mike's doorstep when she was a baby. A running gag in the series is Yung being repeatedly mistaken for a boy. * Marquess of Queensberry (voiced by Jim Rash) ‚Äì The deceased real life father of modern boxing, the Marquess of Queensberry, is an alcoholic, narcissistic and flamboyant ghost who provides Mike with intellectual advice. The Marquess portion of his name is pronounced \\"Marcus\\" and rendered as if it is his actual name, instead of a title. =Recurring characters= * Deezy (voiced by Chuck Deezy) ‚Äì Mike Tyson's agent. * Bert (voiced by Hugh Davidson) ‚Äì A foul-mouthed NYC limo driver. * Carol (voiced by Jill Matson-Sachoff) ‚Äì Mike's short-term wife. * Jillian Davis (voiced by Cheryl Hines) ‚Äì A Newport Beach socialite. * Terry (voiced by Rhys Darby) ‚Äì The good-natured Australian who tends Mike's swimming pool. * Maxine (voiced by Rachael Harris) - The owner of the Don‚Äôt Judge a Book antique store, and a confidant of Marquess's. * Delvin (voiced by David Hoffman or Larry Dorf) - The mild mannered manager of Munn's Supermarket. * Harold Feder (voiced by Kevin Ruf) - Mike's attorney and Yung's godfather. Episodes Reception The series has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The show currently holds an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with its consensus being: \\"A dizzying whirl of lowbrow and high-concept, Mike Tyson Mysteries should more than satisfy fans of Adult Swim's signature blend of animated silliness.\\" On Metacritic, the show has a score of 75 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Cancellation In a May 2020 podcast interview, writer Larry Dorf confirmed that the fourth season would be its last, although Davidson, Ramras, and Dorf would continue working together on a new project for Warner Bros.

Life Charles, born at Warrington, Lancashire, in January 1851, came of a family, originally French, who were long settled in Carnarvon, and owned fishing and cargo boats trading with Anglesey. His father, Richard Charles, was a draughtsman and cabinet maker, who designed the mayor of Carnarvon's chain of office, now in the town hall, where also hangs his portrait painted by his son. As a lad of fourteen, James Charles accompanied his father to London, where he received a desultory education while working in his father's office. He was employed for some time at a lithographer's, then studied at Heatherley School of Fine Art in Newman Street, and finally entered the Royal Academy School in 1872. Cafe Chioggia, Piazza San Marco, Venice Marrying and settling in 1875 at 15 Halsey Street, Chelsea, Charles exhibited his first picture at the Royal Academy, \\"An Italian Youth in Armour\\", and sold it on the opening day. In 1876 he had four pictures in the Academy, including his father's portrait, and in 1877 three portraits, one being of Victor Cavendish the present duke of Devonshire, and his brother as children; from this date to 1904 he was yearly represented by from one to four pictures. Charles also exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery. In 1879 he was introduced to a picture collector of Bradford, John Maddocks, who appreciated his work, and henceforward not only purchased many of his canvases himself, cites Sale Cat. of Maddocks' collection, 30 April 1910 but made him known in Bradford and the north of England, where he established a lasting and profitable connection. Charles exhibited at the newly formed New English Art Club. From 1877 onwards Charles painted a good deal, first at Thorpacre near Loughborough, Leicestershire, and subsequently at South Halting, Petersfield, Sussex, where his subject pictures included \\"Christening Sunday\\" (R.A. 1887), now in the Manchester Art Gallery; the landscape \\"The Lost Cap\\" (was purchased by McCulloch Collection); \\"The Village Post Office\\" (Johannesburg Art Gallery); and \\"Will it Rain ?\\" (Tate Gallery). Between 1889 and 1895 he lived at Colnor House, Bosham, Chichester, where he painted \\"Milking Time,\\" a sunny landscape with cattle (now in the National Gallery of Victoria), and \\"Signing the Marriage Register\\" (R.A. 1895; now in Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford). In 1896 he moved to East Ashling House, Chichester, and engaged in pictures of rustic life. Charles, who had spent two previous seasons in the Paris studios, visited Venice in 1891, and in the same year was elected an associate of the Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts in Paris. In 1896 he produced \\"The Chalk Pit\\", and a year or two later \\"Souvenir of Watteau\\", a fine work in chiaroscuro (now in the Johannesburg Gallery), \\"In Spring Time\\", and many landscapes. The two darkest months of every year he now devoted to Yorkshire, where he undertook many family and presentation portraits. The summer months of 1902 and 1904 were passed at Montreuil-sur-Mer, where some of his most charming coast- and sea-scapes were painted. During the winter of 1905 he was at Capri. Appointed judge at the Carnarvon Eisteddfod in August 1906, he underwent an operation for appendicitis whilst staying at Plas Bennett, Denbigh, in the vale of Clwyd, and died there on 27 Aug. 1906; he was buried in Fulham cemetery. In 1907, after his death, some of Charles's work was shown in the winter exhibition of the Royal Academy, and the sale of seventy-six of his remaining works at the Leicester Gallery produced about ¬£3,000. In addition to the art galleries named, those of Warrington and Dublin also possess examples of his work. Sir John Arthur Godwin (1852-1921) First Lord Mayor of Bradford Family In January 1875 Charles married at the pro- cathedral, Kensington, Ellen Agnes Williams (died 1909) with whom he had five sons and seven daughters. In 1908 a civil list pension of ¬£70. was granted to his widow. Legacy Charles has 63 paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.

History  Give Back was established by Robert Carr, a former resident of Lockport, IL. When Robert was accepted as a student at the University of Illinois, he received a $250 scholarship from the Lockport Woman's Club. The money helped offset some of the costs of college and motivated Robert. He vowed that when he was able, he would give back to the club. Forty years later‚Äîon the organization's 100th anniversary‚Äîhe presented a check for $100,000 to be used for scholarships. Five students each received $5,000 a year for four years. He continued this program for five years, helping 25 students earn a college education. Funding the scholars through the Lockport Woman's Club proved to Bob that students with drive can succeed in college with the help of existing financial assistance programs. Fuelled by the ever-growing student debt problem and studies that suggest family wealth is the greatest predictor of a child's likelihood of graduating from college, Bob founded the Give Something Back Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.  Approach and success  Give Back's results prove the program works: * ¬É 100% of our scholars graduate from high school * ¬É 90% of our scholars graduate from college within four years * ¬É 100% of our scholars who earned college degrees are employed * ¬É Over 50% of Give Back alums serve as mentors Scope Give Back operates in Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, California and Pennsylvania. University partners work with Give Back to combine resources and expertise to give students a chance at a college degree. Give Back scholars can apply to any partner school in the state they live in to receive a scholarship for tuition, room and board. Our model has utilized in-state tuition and the generosity of university partners to pre-pay for over 1000 scholarships and be on track to triple that number.

It is widely used for its multithreaded and multiprocess capabilities such as profiling parallel Message Passing Interface (MPI) or OpenMP applications, including those running on clusters of Linux machines, and for scalar (sequential) code. Profiler It is one of the first profilers able to both analyze and visually display the performance when running at high scales (including many thousands of cores). Arm MAP is also being used to examine applications that are preparing to scale to 1 ExaFLOP/s The profiler uses adaptive sampling methods to identify process counters and activities and combines data from multiple processes that may be running on multiple compute server nodes. It analyzes performance and causes of bottlenecks including: * Processor instruction level - identifying issues such as memory bandwidth, or lack of floating-point vectorization * Memory usage * I/O * Communication - such as MPI * Threads * Energy usage and power This enables developers to identify hotspots and areas of potential improvement. The tool is scalable - and merges performance data using the scalable architecture first used in Arm DDT to debug Petascale (typically over 100,000 processes). Arm MAP shares a common user interface with Arm DDT which together makes the Arm Forge tool suite. This is widely used by research scientists and developers of parallel scientific applications. The Arm MAP profiler is used on large supercomputers and also smaller clusters or workstations.

After a football game in 1921, a reporter wrote that Gonzaga fought tenaciously like bulldogs. Thus, that description became the new mascot. Over the years, Gonzaga has had numerous live bulldogs as mascots. Human mascots replaced live dogs in 1980 when a Gonzaga student, Mike Griffin, wore a cape and called himself \\"Captain Zag.\\" He remained the Gonzaga mascot from 1980 until 1982. A few more students donned the Captain Zag uniform before a bulldog mascot returned in 1985. Spike was named by Craig Evans a 6 year old of the assistant basketball coach Bill Evans. Lee Mauney, a student from Hatchie Bottom, Mississippi, introduced the Gonzaga crowd to the first costumed bulldog mascot in 1985. He held the role from 1985-88. Spike has become synonymous with Gonzaga Athletics. In 2000, Spike rose to national prominence when he was among a group of mascots that appeared in Nike's \\"Welcome to Bracketville\\" promotional commercials for the NCAA Tournament.

Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System for the new entrants to Central/State Government service, except to Armed Forces, replacing the existing system of Defined Benefit Pension System. On 23 August 2003, Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) was established through a resolution by the Government of India to promote, develop and regulate pension sector in India. The contributory pension system was notified by the Government of India on 22 December 2003, now named the National Pension System (NPS) with effect from 1 January 2004. The NPS was subsequently extended to all citizens of the country w.e.f. 1 May 2009 including self employed professionals and others in the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis. The Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority Act was passed on 19 September 2013 and the same was notified on 1 February 2014. PFRDA is regulating NPS, subscribed by employees of Govt. of India, State Governments and by employees of private institutions/organizations & unorganized sectors. The PFRDA is ensuring the orderly growth and development of pension market.  Structure  The Authority consists of a Chairperson and not more than six members, of whom at least three shall be whole-time members, to be appointed by the Central Government. = Current members = # Shri Supratim Bandyopadhyay, Chairperson https://financialservices.gov.in/sites/default/files/Chairman%20PFRDA%20Notification%20%28English%20Version%29.pdf # Shri Pramod Kumar Singh, Whole-Time Member(Law) https://financialservices.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notification%20for%20the%20appointment%20of%20WTM%20%28Law%29%20in%20PFRDA.pdf  History  PFRDA have set up a Trust under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 to oversee the functions of the Pension Fund Managers (PFMs). The NPS Trust is composed of members representing diverse fields and brings wide range of talent to the regulatory framework. The Union Parliament passed the IPRDA [Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority] Bill in February 2003 as a Budget Announcement, approved by the then President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. It was meant to be in place till the final and fool-proof system was prepared, re-approved, and implemented in a way acceptable to all political parties in India, including the opposition. Tamil Nadu became the first state to implement NPS for its newly appointed employees from the financial year 2003‚Äì04, under the Chief Ministership of Jayalalitha. On 19 September 2013,http://www.pfrda.org.in/index.cshtml the President, Pranab Mukherjee, gave his assent to Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill of 2013, which was passed in the Monsoon Session of Parliament on 4 September 2013 in the Lok Sabha and 6 September 2013 in the Rajya Sabha, to make it a Permanent Act. This improved, foolproof and re-approved Bill, with the acceptance of all political parties in India, has replaced the old and imperfect IPRDA Bill of 2003. The President of India is the guardian of the PFRDA, subject to his Financial Emergency Powers, as per the Articles of Indian Constitution. PFRDA now has Full Autonomy & functioning Independently from F.Y. 2014‚Äì15.  National Pension System  National Pension System is a defined contributory pensions introduced by Government of India. It is mandatory for all Central Government employees with effect from 1 January 2004. It extends to all citizens of India including workers of the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis with effect from 1 May 2009. On 29 October 2015 the Reserve Bank of India allowed Non-Resident Indians (NRI) to subscribe to NPS.

The company obtained an act in 1846 for 26 miles of railway, with a main section from Wakefield to Doncaster via Barnsley. The section south of Barnsley became the property of the South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway Company , and the northern section was amalgamated into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway , after which the original company was dissolved. History The Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Wakefield, Huddersfield, and Goole Railway (SRBWH&GR;) applied to Parliament in the 1845/6 session for a railway line. The main line was to begin from junctions with the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway near Brightside and Kimberworth roughly halfway between Sheffield and Rotherham, past Ecclesfield and Tankersley to Barnsley, then past Darton to a junction with the Manchester and Leeds Railway east of Horbury. There were also proposed several branches and deviations of the main line, with junctions to several already established railways, including the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway near Brightside; the Huddersfield and Sheffield Junction Railway near Penistone; two junctions to the North Midland Railway near Cudworth and Carlton; and the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway near Featherstone. The purpose of the railway was to serve the populous regions of West Yorkshire, and to transport minerals (coal) extracted in the Barnsley, Silkstone, and Chapeltown regions. The Act was originally supported by the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;), who were to provide half the capital for the line, as well as work the railway for 40% of net profit; during the passage of the Bill through Parliament agreement was reached that a rival company, the South Yorkshire Coal Railway and Canal Company would take control of the line south of Barnsley, and the LYR the portion north, with each company having running powers over the Silkstone and Dodworth branches. The split in capital apportioned to the construction of the line was ¬£450,000 for the northern part and ¬£350,000 for the southern part. The M&LR; withdrew from the capital subscription arrangements, and instead agreed to take a lease on the line. The company obtained an Act on 7 August 1846, allowing a share capital of ¬£800,000 and permitting raising money by loans of up to ¬£266,000, with railway of authorised, of lines of total length submitted. = Horbury (Wakefield) to Barnsley section= On 9 September 1846 the M&LR; company shareholders agreed to lease, and potentially purchase the line, as permitted in the 1846 Act. The M&LR; (after 1847 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, L&YR;) obtained the line, north of Barnsley (see also Barnsley railway station) running to Horbury Junction southwest of Wakefield. The line was leased at 5% on ¬£260,000 plus receipt of half the calculated net profits. As built the line was single track, excluding at the junction at the Horbury end, and was in length; the line was declared fit for use on 26 December 1849, and was handed to the L&YR; on 31 December 1849. The line was doubled by 1855. The merger of the section of the line leased to the Manchester and Leeds into that company was permitted by the Lancashire & Yorkshire and East Lancashire Railways Act (21 & 22 Vic., Cap. 143, 1858), with the Barnsley company shares converted into ¬£260,050 of L&YR; 'Barnsley stock', after which the SRBWG&GR; was dissolved. As part of the L&YR; (and under the LMS) the line was known as the 'Barnsley branch', with the junction to L&YR; (Manchester & Normanton Line) known as Horbury Junction. Around 1900 a chord was constructed at the northern end (\\"Horbury and Crigglestone loop\\"), creating a large triangle junction. Railway works were established at the junction (see Charles Roberts and Co.).Ordnance Survey. Sheets 248SW, 262NW, 262SW, 274NW, 274NE As of 2006 the line is still extant and in use.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006 =Barnsley to Sheffield section= At a meeting held on 5 October 1846, it was recited that it had now been agreed to lease one portion of the line to the Manchester & Leeds Company and another portion to the South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway Company (SYD&GR;). In the parliamentary session of 1846/7 the company sought permission to deviate and abandon parts of the line permitted by the 1846 Act, as well as allowing the lease or sale of the line south of Barnsley to the South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway Company. At the same time the SYD&GR; was seeking an act to allow its incorporation, acquire the SRBWH&GR;, make new lines, and acquire the River Dun Navigation and Dearne and Dove Canal. The Act enabling the takeover or lease of the railway was passed as the \\"South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway Act, 1847\\", creating the named company with capital of ¬£750,000 and power to raise money through loans up to ¬£250,000. In 1850 the company applied to make a deviation of, and abandon part of the original main line of 1846 between Ecclesfield and Silkstone, passed in 1851.

He participated in plein air sessions in Poland in such places as the Biebrza Valley, Krak√≥w- Czƒôstochowa Upland, Polesie, the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest and Uj≈õcie Warty National Park. In the years 2008 and 2009 he traveled several times to the Ukraine to the regions of the former Kresy (Eastern Borderlands). At that period he made multiple drawings and oil paintings presenting the Dniestr landscape. Among the paintings created at that time is ‚ÄúThe Dniestr at Mariampol at Dusk‚Äù, which is one of the most prominent works in the output of that artist.  Painting and Drawing  = Inspirations = At the source of Aleksander ≈ªywiecki's art lies his fascination with the aesthetics and poetics of the Stimmung landscape painting of the Munich School of the late Nineteenth and the early Twentieth century, where the emotional and climatic visions of the wild nature are identified with the ‚Äúinner landscape‚Äù of emotional states of the human soul.Jerzy Madeyski, Introduction in:Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, Malarstwo. Polskie Pejza≈ºe, Krak√≥w: Biuro Informacyjno-Prawne AKCEPT S.A., 2000, . p. 73-74 = Features of the Style, Subject Matter = In the 1980s, in the early period of his career, the artist used to create abstract postmodern art and to experiment with the modern media and atypical materials. But, as Jerzy Madeyski reports, the young painter ‚Äûsoon noticed that abstract art can only render the most general impressions and feelings, and that wasn‚Äôt enough for him. Abstract art started to be boring and palled on him.‚ÄùMadeyski 72 In the early 1990s he focussed on nature which since that time became the sole theme of his painting. Simultaneously he gave up formal experiments and decided to paint landscape applying the traditional artistic techniques. The nature in ≈ªywiecki's paintings exists apart from man and is free from human influence. As Madeyski comments, Aleksander ≈ªywiecki ‚Äúpaints unpeopled landscapes, unspoiled by the once fashionable or even indispensable prop or vestige of human activity.‚ÄùMadeyski 73 In his works nature is barren, wild and it appears in various moods; sometimes it is hostile and brutally dramatic, sometimes calm, mild, even idyllic. In whatever aspect it shows itself to the viewer, it always remains independent and primeval, unadulterated by the civilisation, unsubdued by man. The nature in the artist's paintings is supposed to play the role which had been once attributed to it by the Romantic and the Polish landscape painters, the representatives of the Munich school: its task is to express, through its mood, the states of the artist mind. Jerzy Madeyski elaborates on this expressionistic aspect of landscape both in the older Masters and in ≈ªywiecki's art: \\"The young artists discovered (that) in landscape (there) was what they wanted to see in it unblemished beauty and the opportunity for a fuller self expression. For the real landscape, painted out of the heartfelt need, is perhaps the most sincere form of the artist's selfportrait, free of all postures or even affectation. Naturally it is an inner portrait, which reflects his entire personality and all of his dreams and ideals. The similarity between the art of Aleksander ≈ªywiecki and his [romantic and postromantic] predecessors' art is neither random nor superficial\\"Madeyski, p. 72-73. ≈ªywiecki, now a painter of the views of nature, was no longer experimenting with unusual modern media, but turned to traditional style and realism. His focus on the techniques that had been recognized for hundreds of years in painting, his insistence on realism is mentioned by Maciej Szczawi≈Ñski in his essay \\"The Dangerous Journey\\" which acts as an introductory word to the artits's album \\"Studia I Szkice.\\" Szczawi≈Ñski writes: \\"realistic painting in particular. Zywiecki; or considerable courage. We need add solitude (whatever happens \\"in opposition to\\" in fine art, most often doesn't recognise crowds or groups). But after all it is our support in well hidden longing for emotion, naturalness, truth and mystery. Mystery does not have to mean cascading manner and theoretical and conceptual hokus-pokus. Its reflection ‚Äî which enables encounter and entry into the depth ‚Äî examines itself especially nowadays in the dense matter of \\"the low\\". In the particles and glimmer of the real. In what whispers, and sometimes cries out to us: clouds and walls, wet soil and arid sand's breath which pulses in fissures of bark and cracks of flesh. Zywiecki risked going back. That means he did not set off in search of a new language (the word \\"new\\" seems to be an identifier of intellectual kitsch and self-advertising deception of). Instead he took a close look at the Polish tradition of landscape painting from the end of 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. (...) The bend of a river in one of the paintings emanated reality (REALITY) . As did the bliss of cumuli over a field. Or the twilight of autumn air. In other words, reality was unreal in these paintings, innumerable in the serious, unhurried sense of things that matter, authen-tic things\\"Szczawi≈Ñski Maciej M., ‚ÄûNiebezpieczna podr√≥≈º‚Äù w: Aleksander ≈ªywiecki Studia i Szkice, Katowice: Polskie Radio Katowice, 2003, . In his mature works the painter's style becomes synthetic; his objective on the formal side is maximum simplicity. Material objects and narrative elements, considered redundant, are eliminated. The landscape becomes reduced to immaterial forces of nature and ungraspable impressions such as vast vacuous spaces, the darkness in the heart of woods or atmospheric phenomena e.g. the pre-storm blackness of heavens, the mist or the gust of wind during torrential rain.Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, facebook, lasy, drzewa, access date 24. 08. 2014 Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, facebook, lasy, drzewa, access date 24. 08. 2014 = Group 4 Landscapes = In July 2012 Aleksander ≈ªywiecki initiated the 4 Landscapes group, which included: Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, Andrzej Kacperek, Pawe≈Ç Kotwicz and Jan Wo≈Çek. Aleksander ≈ªywiecki was the co-author of the group's manifesto stating that an important aim of the group 4 Landscapes is to stop the monopoly of the art promoted by the 21st century Academia and to pave way for all contemporary tendencies in painting, including those whose objective is to give aesthetic pleasure ad arouse emotions.4 pejza≈ºe, painting, info, access date 24. 08. 2014 4 pejza≈ºe, painting, info, access date 24. 08. 2014 = Drawing = Apart from oil paintings Aleksander ≈ªywiecki's output includes also drawings. Many of the sketches were executed with the graphite pencil or, more often, with a broad graphite bar, the tool which enabled the artist to achieve painterly effects. Multiple drawings are studies for paintings but many of them function as independent finished works and are treated on equal basis with the artist's paintings. The largest collections of drawings are those representing the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest or the Rogalin Oks or the works made in Polesie and the Biebrza Marshes.Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, facebook, rysunki, access date 24. 08. 2014 Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, facebook, rysunki, access date 24. 08. 2014 References  Bibliography  * Madeyski Jerzy, \\"Introduction\\" in: Aleksander ≈ªywiecki, Malarstwo.

IAFCS is a non-profit trade association of child safety-related businesses whose aim is to promote and support its members' businesses and the professional childproofing industry as a whole. Member-businesses accomplish this by educating parents, evaluating homes for potential hazards, and professionally installing safety products.  History  The evolution of the International Association for Child Safety began in the mid 1980s. At that time, professional babyproofing was a new entrepreneurial idea. The first companies were all individual businesses working independently of one another, experiencing the typical difficulties of starting a small, unique-concept business. The first meeting was held in Dallas on November 4, 1995, the day before the opening of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) show. About 15 different companies were represented. The name International Association for Child Safety was adopted, with the word ‚Äúinternational‚Äù added to reflect two members from Canada in attendance. This proved insightful as it allowed for the Association to later include members from other countries such as Turkey, England, New Zealand, South Africa, Columbia and the Netherlands. On October 15, 1997, the International Association for Child Safety was incorporated as a nonprofit organization.  Moving Forward  In February 2008, the Officers and Board of Directors held a facilitated strategic planning meeting to lay out future goals for the IAFCS. Many of these goals have since been completed, some highlights of which include: * Hiring an executive director. After over 10 years of operating solely by volunteer members, it was decided that the Association could not continue to grow without this position added. In November 2008, Colleen Driscoll, a long-time IAFCS volunteer and babyproofer, accepted this position. * Streamlining the leadership into three officer/board members to work more efficiently with the executive director, committees and task forces. This was approved and implemented during the 2009 elections. * Moving the annual meetings away from the juvenile industry product show. Annual meetings were held in different locations to encourage attendance and for vendors to bring their safety products to the IAFCS. Recent meetings were held in Atlanta, Georgia (2011); Ft. Lauderdale, Florida (2012); and Las Vegas, Nevada (2013). * Creating new categories of membership including foundation, associate, and manufacturing members. All three categories have been developed with new members in each category. * Creating a task force to develop and implement the childproofing industry's first certification program. The Certified Professional Childproofer (CPC) program was officially launched in 2010, with candidates sitting for the required exam at the 2010 IAFCS conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Additional requirements for certification include 600+ field hours of in-home child safety services, background checks, and references from current clients.

The film was released in the United States in June 2014 and stars Wallace Shawn, Julie Hagerty, Lisa Joyce and Andre Gregory. The film is a production of the Ibsen play dealing with the relationship between an aging architect and a younger woman. The play originally premiered in 1893.  Plot  Halvard Solness (Shawn) is an aging architect of a small town in Norway, who has managed to attain some distinction and local reputation; he has long been married to Aline (Hagerty). One day while his friend Doctor Herdal (Pine) is visiting, Solness has another caller: 22-year-old out-of-towner Hilde Wangel (Joyce), whom the Doctor promptly recognizes from a recent trip. Soon after the Doctor leaves and Solness is alone with Hilde, she reminds him that they are not strangers; they previously met in her home 10 years ago when she was 12. When Solness does not respond to her quickly enough, she reminds him that at one point he made advances to her, offered a romantic interlude, and promised her \\"castles in the sky\\" during their encounter, which she believed. He denies this, but she gradually convinces him that she can assist him with his household duties and he brings her into his home. During the construction of his most recent project, which includes towering steeples, Hilde learns that Solness suffers from acrophobia, a morbid fear of extreme heights, but nonetheless encourages him to climb the steeples to their very heights at the public opening of the newly-completed building. Inspired by her words, Solness begins his ascent to the top of the steeples. At this point the viewer discovers that most of the movie has actually been played out in the head of Hilde; Solness never left his bed from the movie's first scene and he died at the moment that Hilde, in her head, believes he has Hung the Wreathe on the new house he built for his wife. This is symbolic in the sense that he had reached a peaceful and unbelievable resolution to his own happiness and that of those around him.  Cast  * Wallace Shawn as Halvard Solness * Julie Hagerty as Aline Solness * Lisa Joyce as Hilde Wangel * Larry Pine as Dr. Herdal * Andre Gregory as Knut Brovik * Emily Cass McDonnell as Kaia Fosli * Jeff Biehl as Ragnar Brovik  Production  Andre Gregory said that he was drawn to the play due to his age and the themes of redemption. Gregory said of Joyce that she is \\"astounding\\" and hopes that her career takes off, and Demme said that they were all \\"blown away\\" by her performance.  Release  A Master Builder premiered at the Rome Film Festival under the title Fear of Falling. Abramorama released the film in New York on July 23, 2014. In February 2015, after a limited theatrical release in several cities in the United States, the film was released for distribution in streaming video through Amazon.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 84% of 31 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10. Metacritic rated it 62/100 based on eleven reviews. David Edelstein of New York wrote that the film \\"brings the genius of Ibsen to the screen in a way I never thought was possible.\\" Jay Weissberg of Variety called it \\"constricted and uninspired\\".

Early and family life Born in Port Royal, Virginia, William was the grandson of merchant Robert Gravatt, whose Huguenot ancestors had arrived in Caroline County, Virginia after France repealed the Edict of Nantes and began persecuting Protestants. His father was Dr. John James Gravatt (1817-1886) and mother Mary Eliza Smith of Richmond (daughter of Col. J.H. Smith of distinguished English ancestry). Dr. Gravatt served on the vestry of the local Episcopal church for 31 years, and was ultimately buried in the St. Peter's churchyard. One elder brother became a doctor like their father, a sister married a Confederate general, and John Gravatt also became an Episcopal priest in Virginia. During the American Civil War, Dr. Gravatt, a surgeon, ran a hospital in Richmond. After the war, Dr. Gravatt served as Port Royal's mayor as well as became a delegate to the Reconstruction Convention.Brant & Fuller, Eminent and Representative Men of Virginia and the District of Columbia in the Nineteenth Century: With a Concise Historical Sketch of Virginia (1893) p. 449, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=_iRPAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA449&lpg; Young William Gravatt studied at Virginia Tech, and then theology at the Virginia Theological Seminary, graduating in 1884. He later received honorary degrees from Washington and Lee University and the University of the South. He married Sidney S. Peyton of Richmond in 1887 and the couple would ultimately have four children, and die within hours of each other. Career After graduation, William Gravatt served as a curate at St. Paul's Church in Richmond, Virginia for three years, during which he was ordained as a deacon by bishop Francis McNeece Whittle in 1885 and as a priest by the same bishop the following year. Rev. Gravatt then became the rector at St. Peter's Church in Norfolk, Virginia, a newly founded parish where he served until 1893. Rev. Gravatt then accepted the call from prestigious Zion Episcopal Church in Charles Town, West Virginia and became its rector. When West Virginia's Bishop George William Peterkin asked for appointment of a coadjutor in 1899, the diocesan council elected Rev. Gravatt. He was consecrated in November 1899 by Bishops Peterkin, Whittle and Missionary Bishop Charles Clifton Penick. Rt.Rev. Gravatt ultimately succeeded Rt.Rev. Peterkin in 1916, and retired in 1939, the year he helped consecrate his nephew John J. Gravatt (brother John's son). Death and legacy The retired bishop and his wife of 54 years, Sidney Peyton Gravatt, died within 2 hours of each other at their home in Charleston in 1942. Joint services were held at Zion Episcopal Church, Charles Town, where they were both laid to rest.Eleanor Meyer Hamilton, The Flair and the Fire: The Story of the Episcopal Church in West Virginia 1877-1977 (Charleston, Crowder Publishing 1977)at p. 168.

Life Gwrddlew was born about 480 AD at Twrcelyn commote, Anglesey, Wales. He was the son of Caw of Strathclyde. His father had moved from southern Scotland with his family after being deposed in the turbulence caused by the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. He founded churches at Llanddewi Brefi, Cardiganshire, Anglesea Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (1959) p. 91. and Caerleon Legacy Gwrtheli or Gartheli is entered as patron of Capel Gartheli in the Myvyrian Archaiology. This was formerly a chapelry within the parish of Llanddewi Brefi, Cardiganshire, but as of 1907 was a separate benefice. Other chapels in Llanddewi Brefi were Blaenpennal chapel (Saint David), Capel Bettws Lleicu (Saint Lucia) and Capel Gwenfyl (Saint Gwenfyl). Nicholas Roscarrock lists 7 January as the festival of Gwrthelu, who may be identified with Gwrddelw. Sir John Rhys in his Celtic Folklore, page 537, writes of the chapelry in Llanddewi Vrevi, \\"The ascription of this church to a Saint called Gartheli is more than doubtful, as Gartheli is simply garth Eli, that is, Eli's enclosure. If, therefore, the name of the place involves that of a saint, it must be an otherwise unknown Eli. In the account of the hunting of the boar Twrch Trwyth, in the Welsh romance of Culhwch and Olwen, there is a huntsman of Arthur's called Eli, who pursues Grugyn, one of the Twrch's offspring, to Garth Grugyn in Ceredigion. Garth Grugyn is supposed to be near Llanilar. Possibly the original story located at Garth Eli the death of Eli, or some other incident in which Eli was concerned, just as Garth Grugyn is for some reason associated with Grugyn.\\" Etymology of his name  The etymology of the name is Vehemently Brave.

History  Humane Society International (HSI) was established in the United States in 1991. The Australian branch of HSI was the second HSI office to open under the emerging global program, in 1994. The office, located in Sydney, has been operating for two decades under the direction of Verna Simpson and Michael Kennedy. HSI Australia works on national and international conservation and animal protection policy and law, with a special responsibility to reach out to its regional neighbors. At its 1994 inception, the Australian program ran on a budget of less than A$50,000. A few years later, HSI Australia became a regional NGO with a team of staff & consultants, members across the country, and a budget of $2.5 million. HSI Australia also supports activities internationally.  Rationale  HSI Australia‚Äôs vision is consistent with the founding vision of HSI: to change the way people interact with animals and their environments through education and advocacy. The organisation works to protect animals through the development of more ecologically sustainable and humane practices. It runs numerous conservation and animal protection campaigns that cover a broad range in both marine and terrestrial areas. HSI Australia also assists the campaigns of international branches of HSI, such as the anti-Canadian seal hunt and the anti-wildlife trade campaigns. The organisation supports grants and programs across Asia and Africa.  Campaigns and areas of focus  = Farm animal welfare = The organisation is opposed to the export of live animals from Australia , and believes that the frozen meat market is a readily available and ethical option for the industry. Factory farming is a particular focus, as HSI Australia believes that factory farming practices cause unnecessary suffering. The organisation works with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) regarding legislation for pork and poultry, which includes their truthful labeling campaign. Humane Choice - True Free Range, is an accreditation program in which farms can become accredited to Humane Choice standards and be recognised as a 'True Free Range' producer. = Animal testing = Alongside Humane Research Australia (HRA), HSI Australia helped pass the End Cruel Cosmetics Bill, which was introduced by Australian Greens senator Lee Rhiannon. Through the Bill, HSI Australia seeks to achieve a national testing and sales ban in Australia and New Zealand. = Marine campaigns = HSI Australia publicly criticizes Japanese whaling and the Western Australian shark cull. The organisation is a member of the Antarctic Ocean Alliance. HSI Australia's initial legal action against Japan's scientific whaling led to an International Court of Justice (ICJ) case, which ruled in March 2014 that Japan's plan lacked scientific merit. Following the announcement of Japan's \\"Newrep-A\\" plan, scheduled to commence in December 2015, senior program officer Alexia Wellbelove stated: \\"It is now time that Japan listened to international public opinion and consigned their so-called research program and plans to resume commercial whaling to history where it belongs.\\" HSI Australia is against the use of lethal shark control measures within Australia, and has spoken out about the lack of scientific evidence behind the use of such practices as a mitigation strategy. HSI Australia also campaigned alongside its international counterparts to ban the Canadian seal hunt, and is pushing for an end to the trade. = Racing = HSI Australia has taken a critical stance on horse racing, specifically steeplechase, due to the horse deaths and injuries that occur. HSI Australia is campaigning towards its ban in all states. The group also campaigns against Australian Greyhound racing, with a focus placed upon the New South Wales (NSW) sector of the industry. HSI Australia seeks greater transparency in the industry, including stricter welfare standards, and better reporting and investigation of cruelty and mistreatment. = Fur trade = HSI Australia works alongside HSUS, HSI Canada and HSI in the United Kingdom (UK) to highlight the practices of the global fur industry. Within Australia, HSI Australia successfully lobbied for a ban on the import of cat and dog fur, and praises designers and retailers who participate in the ban on fur. The dog meat trade is an ongoing campaign that HSI is working on with its partners, including the Soi Dog Foundation. = Threatened ecological communities = HSI Australia is committed to long term conservation initiatives, and nominates ecological communities under threat for listing under both the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999 (EPBC Act) and the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (TSC Act). = Climate change = HSI Australia aims to combat climate change through the protection of biodiversity. = Wildlife trade = Through representation at international conferences such as CITES, HSI Australia works to combat the global trade in wildlife.  Wildlife Land Trust  In 2007, HSI launched the Wildlife Land Trust Australia (WLT). The principle of WLT is \\"humane stewardship\\" for the purpose of developing a network of permanent sanctuaries throughout the country as well as internationally.  Humane Choice  Humane Choice was launched by HSI Australia in 2006. It is a certification scheme that indicates the humane treatment of farm animals.  Places You Love Alliance  HSI Australia is a member of the Places You Love Alliance, a campaign which includes other not-for-profit environmental advocacy groups, such as The Wilderness Society and the International Fund for Animal Welfare Australia.  Publications  HSI Australia produces numerous publications: * \\"Newsletter\\" - for supporters, featuring project updates and news. * \\"Extinction Denied Technical Bulletin\\" - reporting on domestic and international projects, targeted towards scientific peers. * \\"Campaign Report\\" - annual campaign reports summarizing HSI Australia's yearly activities. * \\"Wildlife Lands\\" - newsletter of WLT.

In spite of overwhelming Dutch superiority in men and ships, the French won a decisive and unexpected victory. Background In 1672, the kingdoms of France and England had declared war on the Dutch Republic. However, Dutch naval victories in the North Sea forced the English to abandon their part in the war in early 1674. The Dutch could now direct all of their considerable naval strength against the French, and they decided to attack Martinique, the headquarters of the French colonial venture in the Caribbean.Marley (2008), vol. 1, p. 277. The Dutch believed that the capture of Martinique would enable them to quickly conquer France's other island outposts and rebuild their own war-ravaged network of Caribbean plantations, giving them dominance of the entire Lesser Antilles island chain.Pritchard (2004), pp. 280-281. To achieve these aims, the Dutch assembled a powerful invasion force under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, widely regarded as the greatest naval commander of the age, whose crushing victories had driven the English out of the war.De la Ronciere (1919), p. 35, Van der Moer (1997), pp. 93, 108. Under his command sailed a fleet of eighteen major warships including his 80-gun flagship De Zeven Provinci√´n, plus thirty- six smaller support ships and troop transports, and an invasion army of 3,400 soldiers.Marley (2008), vol. 1, p. 278. The young Count of Styrum was appointed to lead the ground forces and designated to act as military governor,De la Ronciere (1919), p. 41, Van Schilfgaarde (1961), vol. 3, p. 88. but the assault was entrusted to the Count of Hoorn, the Dutch Republic's top siege-warfare commander.De la Ronciere (1919), p. 36. Martinique was defended by a semi-professional militia consisting of two companies of cavalry and a dozen infantry companies with a theoretical strength of roughly 2,000 men.Elisabeth, (2003), p. 58. Pritchard (2004), p. 54, shows that the number of adult male colonists declined from nearly 2,400 in 1671 to barely 1,800 in 1682. However, the defending French commander, the Marquis de Baas, miscalculated by concentrating his forces to defend the seat of government at Saint-Pierre in the north of the island: de Ruyter chose instead to attack the main anchorage at Fort-Royal on the west coast. The fortified citadel (known today as Fort St.-Louis) was manned by the local militia company, and by the warship Les Jeux under Captain Thomas-Claude Renart, while they could expect some additional assistance from the captains and crews of the merchant ships in the harbour. However, most of these were uncertain military assets. The Fort-Royal militia company could only muster around 100 men, of whom a quarter quickly deserted, including their captain.De la Ronciere (1919), p. 38. Only one of the merchant ships, the Saint-Eustache, carried any notable armament. The citadel was little more than a set of wooden palisades around a steep- sided promontory, with two unfortified artillery positions at the water's edge, a modest battery of four guns pointed outwards from the promontory's southern tip to sweep the outer roadstead of Fort-Royal Bay, and larger emplacement of around a dozen cannon commanding the sheltered anchorage to its east.De la Ronciere (1919), pp. 38, 42. The most significant military presence was thus the warship Les Jeux, but this was a small frigate, barely 100 feet from bow to stern, armed with just twenty-eight cannons, and carrying a crew of only 150 men.Demerliac (1992), p. 41. Battle The Dutch fleet arrived off Martinique on the afternoon of 19 July 1674, but calm conditions prevented them from starting their attack that day, and allowed the French to make hurried defensive preparations. Two merchant ships were scuttled as blockships to impede the deep-water channel leading into the anchorage, and a defensive boom was set across the entrance of the inner harbour; the veteran adventurer Guillaume d'Orange took the lead in organizing the remnants of the militia. The troops were reinforced by a detachment of sailors, combining volunteers from the crews of the two scuttled merchant ships and a small party of trained musketeers from Les Jeux, and as dawn rose on the morning of 20 July, the island's governor, the Chevalier de Sainte-Marthe, arrived to take command of the defense, with a small contingent of additional militiamen. Even with these reinforcements, his defending force consisted of barely 160 men. The Dutch attack began around 9 o'clock, with a cannonade by the ships, followed by the first wave of soldiers in a flotilla of open boats. Rather than attacking the harbour directly, they rowed into the largely undefended bay beneath the steep cliffs on the west side of the fortress, coming ashore around 11 o'clock on the beach where the civilian settlement was located, but the defender fired down from the heights of the fortress, injuring the Count of Styrum.De la Ronciere (1919), pp. 40-41. Popular accounts claim that many of the Dutch troops lost their discipline as they landed, and simply looted a warehouse full of rum, but the commanders rallied their remaining men, and prepared to assault the fortress.Marley (2008), p. 279. The Dutch made an assault against the palisade on the landward side of the fort, where they were repulsed by the musket fire of the militiamen and seamen. A second Dutch force found a narrow passage leading up through the cliffs into the interior of the fortifications, but their attack was seen by Guillaume d'Orange - unable to use a musket due to old war-wounds, he threw down rocks at the Dutchmen; other soldiers and sailors hurried up to assist him, with Ensign de Martignac, the commander of the naval detachment, shooting repeatedly into the densely packed Dutch ranks at close range, aiming his shots to take down two men at a time. This fight came down to hand-to-hand combat, but the Dutch standard-bearer was killed and his flag was captured, apparently by Captain Renart in person.Delahaut and L'√âcuy (1822), pp. 455-456. The Dutch retreated in some disarray, but in the afternoon, they renewed their attack. First, they tried to force the anchorage directly with an attack by frigates, but their advance was stopped by the sunken blockships, and their ships were caught in enfilade between the gun emplacements of the fortress on the west, and the broadsides of Les Jeux and Saint Eustache in the sheltered inner harbour on the eastern side.De la Ronciere (1919), p. 42. When the ships retreated, the infantry attacked against the fortress again, but they found themselves under a devastating artillery fire: Captain Renart had brought Les Jeux close inshore to rake their advancing ranks with broadsides of grapeshot, and he had deployed the ship's six swivel guns in the fort, to fire directly into their attacking front.De la Ronciere (1919), pp. 42-43 After several hours of unsuccessful attacks, Admiral de Ruyter gave the signal to retreat. The Dutch conceded 143 fatalities, and 378 seriously injured personnel. The French had suffered only sixteen casualties in total, including their wounded,De la Ronciere (1919), p. 44. but they were short on ammunition, and they believed that the Dutch would soon renew their assault: Sainte-Marthe abandoned the fort, and ordered the ships to be burned. The remaining merchantmen were duly set alight, but Captain Renart decided to ignore the governor's orders for as long as possible, waiting anxiously aboard Les Jeux all night. Early in the morning, the lack of any evidence of activity around the Dutch beachhead prompted him to send his first officer to investigate: he discovered that the Dutch had withdrawn back to their ships during the hours of darkness and their fleet was already sailing away, leaving only a few of their casualties, too seriously injured to move, amid the dead, and a rout of abandoned weaponry and military equipment. The defending force had won a dramatic and unexpected victory. Aftermath French historians still describe Martinique as an astounding military success: the great de Ruyter and the all-conquering Dutch navy had been defeated by a single frigate.De la Ronciere (1919), p. 35, Verg√©- Francheschi (1997), p. 111. Martinique would remain French. Captain Renart was rewarded with the grand noble title of Marquis d'Amblimont; he would later return to Fort-Royal as governor-general of the French Caribbean. The humiliated Dutch fleet retreated back across the Atlantic, their combat losses compounded by the ravages of sickness. Their ambitions to expand their colonial empire in the Americas were permanently stalled, leaving them with only Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. Modern historians of seventeenth- century Dutch naval power sometimes chose to avoid mentioning the campaign at all.Van der Moer (1997), p. 108.

Background and personal life  Anthony was born in Waukegan, Illinois, the second of five sons of Joseph and Ruth Anthony. He was born into a Baptist family which was very involved with religious music. His aunt was the organist for the Waukegan church his family attended and both of his parents were members of the church choir. He began studying music at age seven; his parents hoped he would be able to play for church services. He graduated in 1949 from Waukegan Township High School, attended Bethel College, St. Paul, Minnesota, and majored in vocal performance at American Conservatory of Music, Chicago. Anthony served in the U.S. Navy as a chaplain's assistant. He was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal; during his time on the carrier, Anthony organized and led a large choral group. Anthony, a baritone, is also a pianist and organist. Anthony married Dorothy Bartlett, a harpist and educator in 1954. Dick and Dorothy had three children, Karyn, Scott and Cheryl.  Career  =Radio and television= Bill Pearce (left) and Dick Anthony circa 1959 Anthony worked as a radio presenter with Jack Wyrtzen's \\"Word of Life\\" radio broadcasts and \\"Songtime\\" weekly show on the ABC television network from New York City. Anthony did not begin singing professionally until he became the arranger for the quartet who performed on the Word of Life. He joined the staff of Chicago radio station WMBI in 1952, performing about 25 broadcasts each week.\\"News and reviews of new albums\\". He worked with gospel songwriter John W. Peterson on a daily radio program called \\"Cheer Up. Anthony also appeared on \\"The Songsters\\" and \\"Keep Praising\\" at WMBI. Anthony frequently performed duets with singer Bill Pearce on broadcasts, recordings and live concerts.\\"Reviews and ratings of new albums\\". Anthony and Pearce met when both worked at WMBI Radio; Pearce was also a member of WMBI's \\"The Melody Four\\" quartet. Both Anthony and Pearce also performed as members of \\"16 Singing Men\\". In 1963 Anthony left WMBI and moved his family to Long Beach, California to direct music at the First Baptist Church of Lakewood. There they expanded the music program from a single choir to ten choirs involving 500 singers and musicians. Anthony left Long Beach in 1967 for an opportunity to work with the newly established television department of \\"Radio Bible Class\\". Anthony became the executive producer and musical director for the \\"Day of Discovery\\", a nationally syndicated television series, and for the \\"Radio Bible Class\\" ministry with Richard DeHaan. The telecasts originated first from St. Petersburg, Florida and later from Winter Haven, Florida. The radio broadcasts came from Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1983 Anthony produced a television series called \\" Praise Song\\" for the Southern Baptist Radio and TV Commission. It consisted of various musicians (including 16 Singing Men, Bruce McCoy and Kim Boyce) performing Christian songs in unusual settings. It was broadcast on the ACTS TV network. =Composing, producing, arranging and conducting= Anthony was arranger, accompanist and orchestral conductor for other musicians and for several albums with \\"The Melody Four\\" quartet. He organized, arranged and conducted about a dozen albums with \\"16 Singing Men\\" for Word Records\\"News and reviews of new albums\\". and Zondervan Records. In all, in recording studios in Chicago, Hollywood and London, he produced more than 100 Christian music albums. Anthony published more than 30 collections of original compositions and arrangements for various vocal and instrumental groups, including four cantatas and a youth musical. Anthony received many offers to work with non- religious music, but was not interested as he preferred to work solely with religious music. He had no bias against secular music and often arranged and composed his religious music with an ear toward popular music as he saw it as a way to reach people. In 1965, he opened Anthony Publishing Company/Anthony Music in Long Beach, which published both religious music and books about it. =Performing= Anthony performed in concert, first with Bill Pearce, \\"The Melody Four\\" and \\"16 Singing Men\\", and, in later years, with his wife and family. He performed internationally with Lareau Lindquist and the mission organization \\"Barnabas International\\", including at Carnegie Hall and Chicago's Orchestra Hall. At Royal Albert Hall he was guest soloist and conductor of a 1000 voice choir. Anthony also performed regularly on a Sunday music program of BBC Radio. He has also performed in remote locations in South America and Africa. From 1985-95, he was artist-in-residence at Northwestern College in St. Paul Minnesota, performing daily radio programs on the college's 10 radio stations as well as lecturing and tutoring on musical composition, arranging and piano improvisation. During the summers of 1987-93 Anthony directed music sessions and conducted evening concerts for the Maranatha Bible and Missionary Conference in Muskegon, Michigan. Retirement and recognition In 1995 Anthony retired to Fort Worth, Texas where he served for 14 years as organist at Birchman Baptist Church. In 2015, Anthony was recognized for his years of work with Moody Radio with a Media Award from the National Religious Broadcasters.

History  Jack was the pet and assistant of double leg amputee signalman James Wide who known as \\"JUMPER\\", who worked for the Cape Town‚ÄìPort Elizabeth Railway service. James \\"Jumper\\" Wide had been known for jumping between railcars until an accident where he fell and lost both of his legs. To assist in performing his duties, Wide purchased the baboon named Jack in 1881, and trained him to push his wheelchair and to operate the railways signals under supervision. An official investigation was initiated after a concerned member of the public reported that a baboon was observed changing railway signals at Uitenhage near Port Elizabeth. After initial skepticism, the railway decided to officially employ Jack once his job competency was verified. The baboon was paid twenty cents a day, and half a bottle of beer each week. It is widely reported that in his nine years of employment with the railway company, Jack never made a single mistake. After nine years of duty, Jack died of tuberculosis in 1890. Jack's skull is in the collection of the Albany Museum in Grahamstown.

In Sukta 104 of the VII Mandala of the Rig Veda in the 22nd mantra addressed to Indra beginning ‚Äì ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§§‡§™‡§§‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§â‡§¨‡•ç‡§ú‡§§‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•É‡§∑‡§£‡§æ ‡§§‡§Æ‡•ã‡§µ‡•É‡§ß‡§É, Rishi Vasishthahmaitravaruni states:- :‡§â‡§≤‡•Ç‡§ï‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§∂‡•Å‡§∂‡•Å‡§≤‡•Ç‡§ï‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§π‡§ø ‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§ï‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ  :‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§ ‡§ó‡•É‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡§¶‡•á‡§µ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•É‡§£ ‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞  ‡•®‡•®  which mantra has been translated by T.H.Griffith in the following manner to mean destroy :- :\\"Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet; destroy him in the form of a dog or cuckoo.\\" :\\"Destroy him shaped as an eagle or as a vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon.\\" But, in fact, in this mantra, Rishi Vasishthahmaitravaruni refers to the Rakshas (‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∏‡•ç) as groups of evil tendencies (vritti), having base animal qualities stemming from the rajas and tamas (gunas), modes of being: viz. 1) ulookavritti, owl tendency, attachment, 2) shushlookavritti, wolf tendency , anger, 3) shvavritti, dog tendency, envy, 4) kokavritti, goose tendency, lustfulness, 5) suparnavritti, kite tendency, ego, and 6) grddhavritti, vulture tendency, greediness. Taking the cue, in the very first Sukta- prayer intended to root out the evil tendencies of the wicked, unsympathetic and uncharitable exploiters of humanity, Yajurveda mantra I.7 reads :- :‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§Ø‡§É  :‡§â‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Æ‡§ø  :\\"The Rakshah group of Rakshas is burnt to ashes, aratayo, reduced to ashes, the former is fired out and the latter too,\\" :\\"I am keeping the vast antariksha.\\" Rati means gati which means motion, movement and advancement; Aratayo means agati or inactivity, slothfulness and inertness. When evil tendencies are destroyed, inactivity disappears and capability to do worthy acts is instilled, misfortune is washed away, then, a person's actions lead him/her to the gain of wealth, and the feeling of benevolence comes to the fore. The worshipper by praying ‚Äì \\"I am keeping the vast antariksha\\" -- seeks to become united with all the capabilities to act (and) thus united he becomes filled up with feelings of benevolence. Heating up of the Rakshas indicates one becoming pure and sanctified whereas the Aratis are meant to be heated up by the fire of true awakening.

The main deity of this temple is Murugan. Visitors need to climb 513 stairs to reach the temple. It is the focal point of the Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia, after the Batu Caves. The hilltop temple, with its seven-storey 21.6m-tall gopuram (main tower), has been touted as the largest Lord Murugan temple outside India. History The grand consecration ceremony (Kumbabishegam) of the newly completed Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani temple was held on 29 June 2012. Built at a cost of 10 million ringgit, this temple is said to be the largest Murugan temple outside India. The timeline of the temple : * 1800 - The shrine located at the base of the great Waterfall within the current Penang Botanic Gardens became the focal point of Thaipusam Festival * 1856 - The earliest known view of the temple at the base of the waterfall through a painting done by Captain Charles Henry Cazalet, thus proving the existence of the temple by then. * 1892 - The Waterfall Reservoir was constructed * 1905 - The formation of the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board * 1913 - To prevent contamination of the water supply at the Waterfall Temple, plans are on the way to remove the Waterfall Temple. Reported out on 13 November 1913 (The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser) * 1914 - A new piece of land having an area of 10 acres, 2 rods, 28 poles known as Lot 5 Mukim XVI was purchased by the then ‚ÄúMohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board‚Äù at a cost of 7,500 Straits Dollars for the purpose of the erection of a new Hindu temple. Reported out on 9 May 1914 (Malaya Tribune) * 1915 - Thaipusam was celebrated at the Hilltop Temple instead of the Waterfall temple for the first time in February 1915. Reported out on 7 June 1915 (Malaya Tribune) * 1985 - The Old Hilltop Temple was rebuilt and the Maha Kumbhabishegam conducted on 28 January 1985 * 2006 - Work begins on the New Hilltop Temple at a new site 30 meters above the old site * 2012 - The New Hilltop Temple Maha Kumbabhishegam was conducted on 29 June 2012. The Thaipusam festival of 2013 was for the first time held in the New Hilltop Temple =Golden Chariot= A RM3mil golden chariot hit the streets on the eve of Thaipusam on 8 February 2017. The 1.6-tonne golden chariot measuring 4.3m-high and 4m-wide will feature two golden horses in the front with several statues adorning the kalasam (tower). The chariot bearing Lord Muruga's vel (spear) will move on rubberised wheels pulled by devotees. The inner frame of the chariot was made in Karaikudi and shipped to Penang where it was assembled. The golden chariot's journey will be from the Arulmigu Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in Queen Street to the Arulmigu Sri Ganesha Temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga. The chariot would be placed at the Sri Ganesha Temple for two days, on Thaipusam eve and on Thaipusam day. An 18-day pooja (special prayers) session will be conducted for The 0.9m-tall golden vel at Queen Street Maha Mariamman Temple. This depicts the story goes that the vel was created by Lord Shiva's consort Parasakthi who is also Lord Murugan's mother. Parasakthi appeared in 18 forms before merging into a single indestructible vel which was handed to Lord Murugan during the Poosa natchathiram on Pournami Day (full moon) in the month of Thai (January to February). After receiving a blessing from the Lord's mother, the vel will be sent back to Lord Murugan on the golden chariot on Thaipusam eve. The golden chariot successfully completed its first trial run for Thaipusam in on 2 February 2017 about two hours through George Town in the presence of a large throng of devotees seeing it for the first time. The chariot went 3 km along Jalan Kebun Bunga, Lorong Air Terjun, Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Macalister, Jalan Residensi and Jalan Utama before returning to the temple.

Daily Poojas Darshan (open to the public) hours are from 6:45 am to 9:00 pm. The temple remains closed from 12:15 pm, reopens at 4:30 pm and closes at 9:15 pm. The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) daily, as well as during festivals Abishegam or Thirumanjanam is the anointment of the idol with oils, sandalwood paste, milk, unguents and the like and then bathing it with water in an act of ritual purification. The most prominent abishegams are conducted at the ceremonies to mark the hours of the day. These are four in number: the Kaala Santhi, early in the morning, the UcchikƒÅlam, in the afternoon, the SƒÅyaratchai, in the evening and the Ardha JƒÅmam, at night, immediately prior to the temple being closed for the day. Each ritual comprises four steps: abishegam (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for all the deities. After the abishegam, it is the practice to dress the idols of the deities, in an act called alangaram, in one of several guises. The worship is held with religious instructions in the Vedas (Sanskrit sacred texts) and Thirumurai (Tamil sacred texts) read by priests. These hours are marked by the tolling of the bell of the temple amidst music with nadaswaram (a pipe instrument) and thavil (a percussion instrument). Devotees are able to perform archanai by the priest thereafter. # Abishegam (6.45 am) # Kaala Santhi (7.30 am) # Abishegam (11.00 am) # Utchikkalam Pooja (12 pm) # Abishegam (5.00 am) # SƒÅyaratchai (6.00 pm) # Abishegam (8.00 am) # Ardha JƒÅmam (9 pm) * Please note that on festivals and special occasions, Abishegam and Poojas start earlier than the scheduled time Chithra Pournami (Chitraparuvam) The Hindu Mahajana Sangam, with notable among the festivals, the annual Chitraparuvam Festival which is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May) every year, is organised with a chariot procession of the panchaloka deity of Lord Subramaniyaswami from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the day of the first full moon of the first Tamil month. In early years, the festival starts with special pooja and ubayam for the Hindu Mahajana Sangam Koota Kadai in Queen Street Mahamariamman Temple, the chariot procession commences in the early morning 7.00 am and reached Waterfall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Gandhiji Ashram) in the afternoon, the deity then carried and placed in the ashram until the return journey of the chariot to Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening of the same day. Since the early 1970s, this festival is celebrated for three days. The deity of Lord Subramaiyaswami is brought in procession from the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple passing through many street and roads before reaching the Waterfall Arulmigu Sri Ganesha temple. The deity is carried up to the Hilltop Arulmigu Sri Balathadayuthapani Temple. On the second day is the Chitraparuvam Festival where the deity is taken in procession around the hilltop temple compound in the evening. On the third day evening, the deity is carried down and placed on the chariot procession journey back to the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple. In 1992, the Hindu Mahajana Sangam imported a new chariot from India, for the annual Chitraparuvam Festival celebration to replace the old chariot which was found to be not road worthy and in a decaying condition.

Early life Born in Mondov√¨, he gave up his studies in medicine to dedicate himself to the study of singing, first in Milan and later with Luigi Leonesi at Conservatorio Rossini in Pesaro, where he was admitted in 1896. He made his d√©but in 1899 at the Teatro Verdi in Lodi as the Herald in Lohengrin. Though he continued working in small, provincial theaters, he soon gave up opera, saying that he did not care \\"for the atmosphere and intrigues.\\" America Shortly thereafter he emigrated to America to join the Klondike Gold Rush but was unsuccessful there. After about three years, he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a bottle washer, waiter, as a navvy on the railroad, and on the docks. A 1904 San Francisco directory shows him residing at 700 Broadway in San Francisco's Chinatown. He continued taking lessons and singing here and there and by a stroke of fortune was heard by Enrico Caruso, who recommended to the impresario Scognamiglio that he engage Viglione Borghese in his traveling opera troupe, whose prima donna was Luisa Tetrazzini. He sang on their 1906‚Äì1906 tour of Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America and from his successes during these performances, he was able to return to Italy at the end of 1906 to pursue an operatic career once more. Operatic career His major stage debut was as Amonasro in a 1907 production of Aida at the Teatro Regio in Parma. The power and size of his voice created a sensation, and he soon was alternating Amonasro with Marcello in La boh√®me and Gerard in Andrea Ch√©nier. About Viglione Borghese's impact on the Italian opera scene, Edgar Herbert- Caesari said: By 1910 Viglione Borghese had reached La Scala, where he made his d√©but as Nelusko in L'africana and later created the role of Guarca in Spyridon Samaras's Rhea. Thereafter his international career accelerated; he began to sing at many of the major European houses and became a house favorite at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. In 1911, he created the role of the sheriff Jack Rance in the Italian premiere of Puccini's La fanciulla del West. This was Viglione Borghese's workhorse role for the rest of his career. He had so much success in it that Puccini himself referred to him as \\"il mio sceriffo.\\" In 1912 he married Claudia Nappi, daughter of the Milanese music critic of La Perseveranza. In 1917, in Rome, he appeared in the world premiere of Renzo Bianchi's Gismonda alongside Ida Quaiatti and Edoardo Garbin. He continued singing until age 64, retiring in 1940 with some 70 roles in his repertoire, primarily comprised by Verdi and verismo literature. He lived in Milan, where he taught voice until he died in 1957.  Recordings  Viglione Borghese‚Äôs published recordings were for Fonotipia Records from 1909 to 1910 and for Polydor Records around 1924. Only fairly recently was it discovered that he made two unpublished disc recordings Edison Records in London in 1911. Marston Records issued these on their two volumes of The Edison Legacy: Unpublished Treasures of the Edison Archive. Actor Viglione Borghese, convinced by Mario Soldati to try his hand at acting in films, debuted in a small role in that director's Piccolo mondo antico in 1941. Over the next eleven years, Viglione Borghese took on similar modest character roles in another twenty films. =Filmography= * Piccolo mondo antico * L'amore canta * Fedora (1942) * The Son of the Red Corsair (1943) * Giacomo the Idealist (1943) * '''' * L'amico delle donne * La primadonna * Piruetas juveniles * L'abito nero da sposa * Il ventesimo duca * Genoveffa di Brabante * Man√π il contrabbandiere * L'ultima cena * Giudicatemi! * The Mill on the Po (1949) * Heaven Over the Marshes (1949) * Hand of Death (1949) * The Mistress of Treves (1952) * Ho sognato il paradiso * Il Diavolo in convento * Mistress of Treves External links * Domenico Viglione Borghese biography at Opera Vivr√† References Category:1877 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Italian operatic baritones Category:Italian male film actors Category:20th-century Italian opera singers Category:19th-century Italian opera singers Category:20th-century Italian male actors Category:People from Mondov√¨ Category:20th-century male singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Domenico Viglione Borghese"},{"id":"43427797","text":"Aerenicella spissicornis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, and the only species in the genus Aerenicella.

She transported cargo between Norway and Spain until 1969, when she was acquired by the Bahama Cement Company. In 1970, she was converted to a bulk cement carrier and she was renamed MV Island Cement. She was used to ship bulk cement between Freeport, Bahamas, Fort Pierce, Port Canaveral, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and to Eleuthera and New Providence in the Bahamas. In 1980, the Company conducted an underwater survey and determined that it was not economical to perform required repairs. Instead, the ship was decommissioned and the company planned to sell her for scrap. The company's port engineer and underwater sports enthusiast Theo (Thanassis) Galanopoulos instead persuaded the company to scuttle the ship as a dive site. After several months of preparation with the assistance of local volunteers and the issuance of a permit by the Government of the Bahamas, the MV Island Cement was towed about 1.5 miles off Williamstown, Grand Bahama Island and scuttled on 16 October 1982.

After two and a half week siege, the French capitulated after suffering heavy losses. The War of the First Coalition operation was fought at Le Quesnoy, located near the border with Belgium about west of Maubeuge. After the successful Sieges of Cond√© and Valenciennes, the Coalition divided their forces. While an Austrian army laid siege to Le Quesnoy, a British-led army marched west to the coast to operate against Dunkirk. On 11 September, two French columns marched to the relief of Le Quesnoy. The force from Cambrai on the west came to grief in the Battle of Avesnes-le-Sec while the force from Maubeuge was also repelled. The Le Quesnoy garrison laid down their arms on 13 September, but the Siege of Dunkirk was a total failure. Undeterred, the Austrian host next laid siege to Maubeuge, leading to the Battle of Wattignies in mid-October. Siege The Coalition besieging force under the Count of Clerfayt numbered about 18,000 troops in 24 battalions and 10 squadrons. There were five Austrian grenadier battalions, those of Attems, Sinoth, Ulm, Ulrich and Watsch. The Austrian line infantry included two battalions each of Infantry Regiments Archduke Charles Nr. 3, Deutschmeister Nr. 4, Klebek Nr. 14, Hohenlohe Nr. 17, Grand Duke of Tuscany Nr. 23, Wartensleben Nr. 28, Michael Wallis Nr. 29, Erbach Nr. 42 and Stain Nr. 50, and one battalion of Infantry Regiment Beaulieu Nr. 59.

The French Royalist cavalry included two squadrons each of the B√©rch√©ny and Saxe Hussars. Results The Coalition admitted losses of 208 killed and wounded during the siege. The French lost about 1,000 killed out of a garrison of 5,000 troops. The 4,000 survivors became prisoners of war.

Nandgaon town, in present-day Rajnandgaon District of Chhattisgarh, was the only town of the state and the see of the ruler's residence. The first ruler Mahant Ghasi Das, was recognized as a feudal chief by the British government in 1865 and was granted a sanad of adoption. Later the British conferred the title of raja on the ruling mahant. History =Historical background= The foundation of the estate of Nandgaon hails back to Prahlad Das, a shawl merchant who in the 18th century had migrated from the Punjab region. When he settled in Ratanpur the area was ruled by the Bhonsle clan of Marathas. Prahlad Das belonged the Bairagi sect whose members practised strict celibacy. The word 'Bairagi' is derived from the Sanskrit VairƒÅgya, meaning 'freedom from passions'. Succession was ensured by chosen disciples, Chela, who became Mahants and inherited all the possessions of their predecessor. Prahlad Das became wealthy and after his death his disciple Hari Das was given power and influence by the local Maratha ruler who promoted him as his spiritual advisor. After about a century the Mahants had acquired the four parganas of Nandgaon, Pandadah, Mohgaon and Dongargaon, former feudatory estates of the Raja of Nagpur. =Princely State= Nandgaon State proper was founded in 1865 when the four feudatory parganas ruled by the Bairagi Mahants were merged and recognized as a princely state. The vow of celibacy of the rulers lasted until 1879, when the seventh Mahant, Ghasi Das, who had married and had a son, was recognized by the British government as an hereditary ruler. Most of the inhabitants of the state were Gonds, Telis, Chamars and Ahirs distributed in 515 small villages in the area.The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India Nandgaon State's last ruler signed the accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1948.Nandgaon Princely State =Rulers= The rulers of the princely state of Nandgaon bore the title of 'Mahant'.Princely States of India Mahants *1865 ‚Äì Nov 1883 Ghasi Das (b. 1820 ‚Äì d. 1883) *1883 ‚Äì 1897 Balram Das (b. 1866 ‚Äì d. 1897) (personal style Raja Bahadur from 2 January 1893) *1897 ‚Äì 25 May 1912 Rajendra Das (d. 1912) *24 Jun 1913 ‚Äì 1940 Sarveshvara Das (b. 1906 ‚Äì d. ....) *18 Sep 1940 ‚Äì 15 August 1947 Digvijai Das (b. 1933 ‚Äì d. 1958)  See also  * Eastern States Agency * Chhattisgarh Division *Political integration of India References External links *Bairagi Category:Princely states of India Category:History of Chhattisgarh Category:Rajnandgaon district ","title":"Nandgaon State"},{"id":"43428287","text":"Rear Admiral Anthony Rohan Amarasinghe, RSP, VSV, USP, psc, MNI, SLN was a distinguished Sri Lankan admiral and a Commissioned Naval Officer.

The church occupies a reconstructed structure that was once the former Adrian Hotel. It is included in the National Register of Historic Places. Harbor Church, or the First Baptist Church, is a historic Baptist church in the resort community of Block Island, which is located ten miles off the southern coast of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Harbor Church was organized on October 23, 1765, in what became the city of New Shoreham. Located at 21 Water Street, the church is a physical landmark visible along that section of the Atlantic coast. In 1974, Harbor Church, along with other buildings in the Old Harbor Historic District in New Shoreham, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History Harbor Church is believed to have begun as early as 1662, when the first English settlers arrived at Block Island, presumably in search of freedom of religion. These settlers met for services in individual homes. It was not until 1763 that the congregation was formally established. Four previous church buildings are no longer standing. The fourth building at the area known as Old Harbor had the first furnace on Block Island. With tourism, especially from May to October, important to the area, Harbor Church constructed a summer chapel with a pipe organ. This fourth church building, however, was later destroyed in a fire. The fifth former location of the church was on Chapel Street in Old Harbor. In addition to worship services, this building hosted such community events as school graduations. In October 1944, the church received as a gift the title to the Adrian Hotel, a Victorian-style structure built in 1886. Two months later, the church on Chapel Street burned to the ground. The congregation had little funding available to rebuild in part because of devastating consequences from the Hurricane of 1938. The former hotel hence became unexpectedly the sixth home of Harbor Church, with services held in the former hotel dining room. After the sale of the parsonage to raise funds, the cornerstone was laid in 1952, and the current sanctuary was added to the reconstructed seventh and current church building. During the 1970s, a pastor's office was established within the church. The current parsonage was formed through the restoration of several former hotel rooms upstairs in the church building. Church activities Tourists often swell the number attending weekly worship services, which begin Sundays at 10 a.m. The church offers Bible study at 7 p.m. on Thursdays and a fellowship breakfast for men at 7:30 a.m. Saturdays.The Harbor Light, The First Baptist Church of Block Island, Rhode Island, Summer 2009 In August, Harbor Church holds Vacation Bible School. The church can seat up to 120 persons and hosts weddings, including couples from outside the community who wish to marry in the resort environment. Harbor Church the second weekend of August holds the annual Block Island Arts Festival. The church also hosts the Block Island chapter of the Boy Scouts of America. The town recreational center operates in the church basement. Since 2009, the Harbor Church pastor has been the Reverend Stephen Eugene Hollaway, a poet born in 1952 in Japan and reared in Tokyo and then Nashville, Tennessee. He is a graduate of Princeton Seminary in New Jersey and a member of the board of directors of the Rhode Island Baptist Heritage Center. His wife, Rebecca P. \\"Becca\\" Hollaway, originally from Atlanta, Georgia, is an artist and a potter. Each summer Jim Wallis, the founder and editor of Sojourners magazine, a theologian of the evangelical left, and an advocate of issues of peace and social justice, addresses the Harbor Church congregation. He has long-term ties to Block Island, where he vacations to reflect and write. His wife, Joy, is one of the first women ordained as an Anglican priest. Harbor Church observed its 250th anniversary in 2015.
